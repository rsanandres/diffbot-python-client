The nearest road closes in the winter. The most substantial town within 60 miles tallies just 9,000 people.</p>\n<p>Look closely at the landscape, though, and you&rsquo;ll see the place is covered in plastic. Between November 2017 and March 2018, researchers gathered water from the weather station&rsquo;s collectors and searched for <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/microplastics.html\">microplastics</a>&mdash;bits less than a fifth of an inch long&mdash;and discovered that 365 particles land on every square meter each day. The source? Likely winds blowing from big cities like Barcelona, 100 miles to the south.</p>\n<p>With the discovery, the researchers have revealed a new horror of plastic pollution. Scientists already knew that microplastics can hang in the air of big cities like Paris and Dongguan, China, but no one has yet shown just how far these things can travel. This work was a short-term pilot study that demands further investigation from other researchers, but the implications are shocking&mdash;for supposedly pristine environments the world over, for ecosystems, and for human health.</p>\n<p>The central problem when it comes to plastic, as we&rsquo;ve all heard, is that the stuff takes a thousand or so years to decompose, bouncing around the environment in the meantime. And when something like a plastic bottle decomposes, it sloughs off tiny bits of itself, microplastics that then make their way into organisms. This is a particular problem in the sea, which has been fairly well studied: One survey found that mussels sampled around the UK <em>all</em> <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749118302197\">had microplastics in them</a>.</p>\n<p>Less well understood at this point is how different plastic types&mdash;the researchers found a range in their samples, from polystyrene to polyethylene to polypropylene&mdash;travel through the atmosphere differently based on their material properties. Also poorly understood is how the shape of a microplastic, whether it be more of a film or fiber or fragment, affects its movement. You might assume a film with more surface area would travel farther than a fragment, but that just hasn&rsquo;t been tested.</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;What they showed was that within 6 hours these nanoparticles are marching through the animal. They&rsquo;re in every part of the animal in 6 hours.&rdquo;</aside>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the challenges moving forward is trying to actually model how these plastics move in 3D in the air, so we can figure out where they come from,&rdquo; says environmental pollution scientist Deonie Allen of the EcoLab, part of the National Center of Scientific Research for France, coauthor on a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0335-5\">new paper</a> in <em>Nature Geoscience</em>.</p>\n<p>To a certain degree, perhaps it isn&rsquo;t too surprising that the researchers found microplastics here in the Pyrenees, because in their sampling they came across another important clue: a fine orange dust. This probably blew in from the Sahara, a phenomenon this monitoring station has recorded for over a century. (More incredible still, dust from the Sahara also crosses the Atlantic to <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/92358/here-comes-the-saharan-dust\">fertilize the rainforests of South America</a>.)</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The winds don&rsquo;t make a distinction between the type of the particles,&rdquo; says marine geologist Mich&egrave;lle van der Does, who has studied the <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/12/eaau2768\">long-range transport of dust particles</a>, but who wasn&rsquo;t involved in this new work. &ldquo;These plastic particles are much bigger than the dust particles we find, although we find these giant dust particles as well. But their density is much lower, so they&rsquo;re also more easily transported over great distances.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Another consideration is the unique nature of plastic decomposition. As microplastics break apart, theoretically their properties would change. So a single fiber might break into two fibers, creating new pieces with new aerodynamics. As they break down further, microplastics eventually become something even more sinister: the nanoplastic, a piece smaller than a micron, or a millionth of a meter.</p>\n<p>These vanishingly small bits of plastic can get just about anywhere, including throughout an organism&rsquo;s tissues, as researchers found when they introduced nanoplastics to scallops. &ldquo;What they showed was that within 6 hours these nanoparticles are marching through the animal,&rdquo; says study coauthor Steve Allen, an environmental pollution scientist at the University of Strathclyde and EcoLab (and spouse of Deonie Allen). &ldquo;They&rsquo;re in every part of the animal in 6 hours.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just the plastic itself that organisms have to worry about. &ldquo;We do know that these plastics absorb all of the chemicals they pass through in the environment, like pesticides,&rdquo; Steve Allen says. &ldquo;We also know they have heavy metals sticking to them. So if these particles pass into your lungs and carry those chemicals in there, we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen there yet either.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Even more concerning: Nanoplastics look a lot like the nanoparticles used in medicine to deliver drugs in the human body. &ldquo;So they can go through the blood-brain barrier potentially in exactly the same way but carrying their toxins,&rdquo; Deonie Allen says. &ldquo;And this is really worrying.&rdquo; To be clear, though, this idea has not been backed up with data.</p>\n<p>Researchers <em>have</em>, however, explored another troubling characteristic of plastic in the oceans. &ldquo;In some ecosystems like coral reefs, plastics work as disease vectors,&rdquo; says Luiz Rocha, curator of fishes at the California Academy of Sciences, who wasn&rsquo;t involved in this study. &ldquo;So a piece of plastic is like a little petri dish for all kinds of bacteria, including pathogens. As they go along the reef, they touch one coral and another coral and they transmit the disease.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Whether microplastics could act as disease vectors on land is yet another question that demands more research. But it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that the microplastic and nanoplastic problem isn&rsquo;t a land-sea dichotomy. Plastic&rsquo;s effect on sea creatures has been much more thoroughly studied than its effects on land creatures like us, but there&rsquo;s also quite a bit of interplay between the two environments.</p>\n<p>Take laundry, for instance. Washing clothing like yoga pants and fleeces can release hundreds of thousands of synthetic fibers per wash cycle into the environment. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t get completely removed by the filters, they don&rsquo;t get completely removed by the wastewater treatment plants,&rdquo; says University of Aveiro analytical chemist Jo&atilde;o Pinto da Costa, who has <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468584417300417\">studied plastics in the environment</a> but who wasn&rsquo;t involved in this new research. The fibers end up in rivers and seas, but also in sediments, where they dry out and get picked up by the wind. &ldquo;Also, when you&rsquo;re just putting your clothes up to dry, it&rsquo;s easy to imagine that a lot of fibers will be transported in the wind.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This presents us with an astoundingly complex problem. Plastics have made the world an undoubtedly safer and healthier place&mdash;imagine what medicine alone would be like without the technology. But the scale with which plastics are contaminating this planet and its lifeforms is growing ever clearer. Even if your country decides to ban all single-use plastic bags, your neighbors might still churn them out and, if this developing model of airborne contamination holds true, the resulting microplastics could blow your way. In that sense it&rsquo;s not so different from climate change: Either we all tackle it together, or we risk getting nowhere.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It means that it&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s problem,&rdquo; Deonie Allen says. &ldquo;But it also means that if you think of the amount of pollution there is in places like China, where they go around wearing masks, that is something we could potentially be facing because we aren&rsquo;t managing our plastic. That&rsquo;s quite scary and it might motivate people to do something.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting again that this was a small pilot study. But it&rsquo;s also worth noting that part of the reason for that was the researchers were so alarmed by the findings, they wanted to get the word out quickly so the scientific community could investigate further how microplastics are blowing around Earth.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re breathing it,&rdquo; says Deonie Allen. &ldquo;Look up, people. Don&rsquo;t just look down.&rdquo;</p>",

This work was a short-term pilot study that demands further investigation from other researchers, but the implications are shocking\u2014for supposedly pristine environments the world over, for ecosystems, and for human health.\nThe central problem when it comes to plastic, as we\u2019ve all heard, is that the stuff takes a thousand or so years to decompose, bouncing around the environment in the meantime. And when something like a plastic bottle decomposes, it sloughs off tiny bits of itself, microplastics that then make their way into organisms. This is a particular problem in the sea, which has been fairly well studied: One survey found that mussels sampled around the UK all had microplastics in them.\nLess well understood at this point is how different plastic types\u2014the researchers found a range in their samples, from polystyrene to polyethylene to polypropylene\u2014travel through the atmosphere differently based on their material properties. Also poorly understood is how the shape of a microplastic, whether it be more of a film or fiber or fragment, affects its movement. You might assume a film with more surface area would travel farther than a fragment, but that just hasn\u2019t been tested.\n\u201cWhat they showed was that within 6 hours these nanoparticles are marching through the animal. They\u2019re in every part of the animal in 6 hours.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the challenges moving forward is trying to actually model how these plastics move in 3D in the air, so we can figure out where they come from,\u201d says environmental pollution scientist Deonie Allen of the EcoLab, part of the National Center of Scientific Research for France, coauthor on a new paper in Nature Geoscience.\nTo a certain degree, perhaps it isn\u2019t too surprising that the researchers found microplastics here in the Pyrenees, because in their sampling they came across another important clue: a fine orange dust. This probably blew in from the Sahara, a phenomenon this monitoring station has recorded for over a century. (More incredible still, dust from the Sahara also crosses the Atlantic to fertilize the rainforests of South America.)\n\u201cThe winds don\u2019t make a distinction between the type of the particles,\u201d says marine geologist Mich\u00e8lle van der Does, who has studied the long-range transport of dust particles, but who wasn\u2019t involved in this new work. \u201cThese plastic particles are much bigger than the dust particles we find, although we find these giant dust particles as well. But their density is much lower, so they\u2019re also more easily transported over great distances.\u201d\nAnother consideration is the unique nature of plastic decomposition. As microplastics break apart, theoretically their properties would change. So a single fiber might break into two fibers, creating new pieces with new aerodynamics. As they break down further, microplastics eventually become something even more sinister: the nanoplastic, a piece smaller than a micron, or a millionth of a meter.\nThese vanishingly small bits of plastic can get just about anywhere, including throughout an organism\u2019s tissues, as researchers found when they introduced nanoplastics to scallops. \u201cWhat they showed was that within 6 hours these nanoparticles are marching through the animal,\u201d says study coauthor Steve Allen, an environmental pollution scientist at the University of Strathclyde and EcoLab (and spouse of Deonie Allen). \u201cThey\u2019re in every part of the animal in 6 hours.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just the plastic itself that organisms have to worry about. \u201cWe do know that these plastics absorb all of the chemicals they pass through in the environment, like pesticides,\u201d Steve Allen says. \u201cWe also know they have heavy metals sticking to them. So if these particles pass into your lungs and carry those chemicals in there, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen there yet either.\u201d\nEven more concerning: Nanoplastics look a lot like the nanoparticles used in medicine to deliver drugs in the human body. \u201cSo they can go through the blood-brain barrier potentially in exactly the same way but carrying their toxins,\u201d Deonie Allen says. \u201cAnd this is really worrying.\u201d To be clear, though, this idea has not been backed up with data.\nResearchers have, however, explored another troubling characteristic of plastic in the oceans. \u201cIn some ecosystems like coral reefs, plastics work as disease vectors,\u201d says Luiz Rocha, curator of fishes at the California Academy of Sciences, who wasn\u2019t involved in this study. \u201cSo a piece of plastic is like a little petri dish for all kinds of bacteria, including pathogens. As they go along the reef, they touch one coral and another coral and they transmit the disease.\u201d\nWhether microplastics could act as disease vectors on land is yet another question that demands more research. But it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the microplastic and nanoplastic problem isn\u2019t a land-sea dichotomy. Plastic\u2019s effect on sea creatures has been much more thoroughly studied than its effects on land creatures like us, but there\u2019s also quite a bit of interplay between the two environments.\nTake laundry, for instance. Washing clothing like yoga pants and fleeces can release hundreds of thousands of synthetic fibers per wash cycle into the environment. \u201cThey don\u2019t get completely removed by the filters, they don\u2019t get completely removed by the wastewater treatment plants,\u201d says University of Aveiro analytical chemist Jo\u00e3o Pinto da Costa, who has studied plastics in the environment but who wasn\u2019t involved in this new research. The fibers end up in rivers and seas, but also in sediments, where they dry out and get picked up by the wind. \u201cAlso, when you\u2019re just putting your clothes up to dry, it\u2019s easy to imagine that a lot of fibers will be transported in the wind.\u201d\nThis presents us with an astoundingly complex problem. Plastics have made the world an undoubtedly safer and healthier place\u2014imagine what medicine alone would be like without the technology. But the scale with which plastics are contaminating this planet and its lifeforms is growing ever clearer. Even if your country decides to ban all single-use plastic bags, your neighbors might still churn them out and, if this developing model of airborne contamination holds true, the resulting microplastics could blow your way. In that sense it\u2019s not so different from climate change: Either we all tackle it together, or we risk getting nowhere.\n\u201cIt means that it\u2019s everybody\u2019s problem,\u201d Deonie Allen says. \u201cBut it also means that if you think of the amount of pollution there is in places like China, where they go around wearing masks, that is something we could potentially be facing because we aren\u2019t managing our plastic. That\u2019s quite scary and it might motivate people to do something.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth noting again that this was a small pilot study. But it\u2019s also worth noting that part of the reason for that was the researchers were so alarmed by the findings, they wanted to get the word out quickly so the scientific community could investigate further how microplastics are blowing around Earth.\n\u201cWe\u2019re breathing it,\u201d says Deonie Allen. \u201cLook up, people. Don\u2019t just look down.\u201d",

But neither of the boys had cancer, nor were they recent transplant recipients, nor did they have any number of medical concerns that would make inoculation unsafe. When investigators looked more closely, they found that the boys&rsquo; medical exemptions had been written by a doctor hundreds of miles away from their home.</p>\n<p>Health officials fear that questionable medical exemptions for vaccinations are on the rise in California. A <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB277\">2015 law</a> made it a requirement for all exemptions to be medically approved, making California among the most restrictive states when it comes to opting out of vaccination requirements. (Previously, parents only needed to state their religious or personal beliefs to get a pass from vaccinating their kids.) But since the law was enacted, &ldquo;we noticed the rise in advertisement on social media by physicians who are saying, &lsquo;if you pay me cash I will evaluate your child for an exemption,'&rdquo; said state Sen. Richard Pan, a Sacramento pediatrician who authored the 2015 law. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve even seen posted on Facebook, &lsquo;My child&rsquo;s doctor won&rsquo;t write me an exemption, so I had to go travel a couple hundred miles and pay 300 bucks to get one.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;We noticed the rise in advertisement on social media by physicians who are saying, &lsquo;If you pay me cash I will evaluate your child for an exemption.'&rdquo;</aside>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of practice Pan is hoping to crack down on. The new bill he introduced in March, <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB276\">SB 276</a>, would create a standardized vaccine exemption request form and subject all requests to review by the state health department. Currently, schools are charged with deciding whether to accept medical exemptions written by doctors. If passed, the bill would make California just the third state to require childhood vaccine exemptions to go through a centralized review.</p>\n<p>Concerns about the return of once-rare infectious diseases have gained urgency in recent months as measles outbreaks surfaced <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/02/washingtons-measles-outbreak-is-a-wakeup-call-on-childhood-vaccination/\">throughout the country</a>. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been 555 cases of measles so far this year, with two ongoing outbreaks and 21 individual cases in California. Many of the flareups are emerging in pockets of the country with low vaccination rates, highlighting the perils of not meeting the threshold for herd immunity&mdash;the idea that a disease won&rsquo;t be able to spread if enough people are vaccinated. &ldquo;That means the difference between a measles outbreak and no measles outbreak,&rdquo; said Matthew Daley, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, whose research focuses on vaccinations. &ldquo;Strategies to improve immunization rates don&rsquo;t just protect those individuals, they protect folks who can&rsquo;t get immunized.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, more than 40 people came down with the <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/02/washingtons-measles-outbreak-is-a-wakeup-call-on-childhood-vaccination/\">measles in Washington</a>, prompting Gov. Jay Inslee to declare a state of emergency. Clinical vaccination rates in the state for kindergartners fall well below the required 95 percent threshold for herd immunity, hovering around 90 percent and dipping even lower in certain areas. Last week, New York City declared a public health emergency in response to a months-long outbreak in Brooklyn&rsquo;s Orthodox Jewish community, requiring all unvaccinated individuals to get their shots or potentially face a $1,000 fine.</p>\n<p>California began tightening the loopholes around vaccine exemptions after a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-disneyland-measles-under-vaccination-20150316-story.html\">measles outbreak</a> started at Disneyland in December 2014, when 147 people caught the disease. The following year, Pan authored <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB277\">SB 277</a>, which eliminated the personal belief exemption. When Gov. Jerry Brown signed the bill, California became the first state in three decades to successfully tighten its requirements, joining West Virginia and Mississippi as the only three states that do not allow personal or religious exemptions. At first, it seemed like the law was working&mdash;immunization rates <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/2017-2018KindergartenSummaryReport.pdf\">were above</a> 95 percent in the 2017-18 school year, up from 92.8 percent in the 2015-16 year.</p>\n<aside>There have been 555 cases of measles nationwide so far this year.</aside>\n<p>But in that same time span, the number of medical exemptions more than quadrupled. True medical reasons that prevent a child from being vaccinated do exist, but Daley noted that they are incredibly rare, such as children who are immunocompromised due to leukemia. While it&rsquo;s possible that the parents of some children with legitimate medical concerns had opted for the easier personal belief exemption, Pan said that the overall patterns in the surge in medical exemptions left him skeptical. Some schools, he said, have vaccination rates in the 70s or lower, while only about 1 percent of children are expected to have legitimate medical conditions preventing vaccination. &ldquo;These are not schools of children who have cancer or who just received transplants,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>In the 2017-18 school year, <a href=\"https://californiahealthline.org/news/exemptions-surge-as-parents-and-doctors-do-hail-mary-around-vaccine-laws/\">more than 4,000</a> medical exemptions were accepted in California. Around the same time, officials started noticing the emergence of advertisements touting exemptions for a hefty fee. A studyof the law&rsquo;s implementation, published in the journal <em>Pediatrics</em>, highlighted various instances of malpractice around doctors helping parents obtain faulty exemptions. Some doctors, who did not specialize in pediatrics, family health, or other relevant practice, would give exemptions to patients who they did not regularly see. One <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/142/5/e20181051.full.pdf\">investigator told researchers</a> about a physician who charged $300 for a temporary, three-month exemption. &ldquo;She used to just give permanent medical exemptions, and now she&rsquo;s giving temporary for three months,&rdquo; the health official said. &ldquo;So, now families have to go back every three months and pay $300 to get their temporary medical exemption updated. They&rsquo;re being told you have to renew this every three months. Well, that&rsquo;s not true it all. It&rsquo;s a business decision on her part.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Some doctors have even become the go-to for vaccine-hesitant parents. A <em>Voice of San Diego</em> investigation found that in the local school district, <a href=\"https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/one-doctor-is-responsible-for-a-third-of-all-medical-vaccine-exemptions-in-san-diego/\">nearly a third</a> of the 486 exemptions were written by the same doctor.</p>\n<aside>In a San Diego school district, nearly a third of the 486 exemptions were written by the same doctor.</aside>\n<p>The onus is placed on schools to judge whether these exemptions are valid, Daley said. Overwhelmed and underfunded, many don&rsquo;t have sufficient nursing staff to meet the workload. Rather than have schools be the judge, Pan&rsquo;s bill would move the enforcement mechanism to a central body, the state department of health. Currently, West Virginia and Mississippi are the only two states that require medical exemptions to be cleared by a central authority. Unsurprisingly, they have some of the highest vaccination rates in the country. (Though both states have seen a push for looser restrictions, bills to resurrect a personal exemption have been introduced in <a href=\"http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=SB454%20INTR.htm&yr=2019&sesstype=RS&i=454\">both</a> <a href=\"https://mississippitoday.org/2018/01/25/ghost-of-hb-1523-could-resurrect-a-religious-exemption-for-vaccination/\">statehouses</a>.)</p>\n<p>Since it was announced in March, SB 276 has already drawn fierce opposition from the anti-vaccination camp, including a flurry of posts on the Facebook page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CaliforniansAgainstSB277/\">Californians for Vaccine Choice</a>, a group formed in 2015 to oppose Pan&rsquo;s first regulation. In a March post, the group called on parents to call their representatives, emphasizing that the &ldquo;doctor-patient relationship should be protected&rdquo; and that &ldquo;this is a health issue. Not a vaccine issue.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Pan noted that the bill is backed by physicians&rsquo; groups like the California Medical Association and that the law doesn&rsquo;t force anyone to vaccinate their child. It simply prevents unvaccinated children from enrolling in school, he said, where the could possibly endanger someone who has a weakened immune system. &ldquo;Frankly as much as the opposition says we&rsquo;re trying to limit rights and freedoms, the public deserves to be free to go about the community without worrying about getting exposed to disease,&rdquo; Pan said. &ldquo;Every time a child receives a false medical exemption, when a physician has forgotten their oath, they are putting other children at risk.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "When public health officials began investigating a Bay Area measles outbreak last year, the case led them to two boys who were supposed to be medically exempt from vaccinations. But neither of the boys had cancer, nor were they recent transplant recipients, nor did they have any number of medical concerns that would make inoculation unsafe. When investigators looked more closely, they found that the boys\u2019 medical exemptions had been written by a doctor hundreds of miles away from their home.\nHealth officials fear that questionable medical exemptions for vaccinations are on the rise in California. A 2015 law made it a requirement for all exemptions to be medically approved, making California among the most restrictive states when it comes to opting out of vaccination requirements. (Previously, parents only needed to state their religious or personal beliefs to get a pass from vaccinating their kids.) But since the law was enacted, \u201cwe noticed the rise in advertisement on social media by physicians who are saying, \u2018if you pay me cash I will evaluate your child for an exemption,'\u201d said state Sen. Richard Pan, a Sacramento pediatrician who authored the 2015 law. \u201cWe\u2019ve even seen posted on Facebook, \u2018My child\u2019s doctor won\u2019t write me an exemption, so I had to go travel a couple hundred miles and pay 300 bucks to get one.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWe noticed the rise in advertisement on social media by physicians who are saying, \u2018If you pay me cash I will evaluate your child for an exemption.'\u201d\nThat\u2019s the kind of practice Pan is hoping to crack down on. The new bill he introduced in March, SB 276, would create a standardized vaccine exemption request form and subject all requests to review by the state health department. Currently, schools are charged with deciding whether to accept medical exemptions written by doctors. If passed, the bill would make California just the third state to require childhood vaccine exemptions to go through a centralized review.\nConcerns about the return of once-rare infectious diseases have gained urgency in recent months as measles outbreaks surfaced throughout the country. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been 555 cases of measles so far this year, with two ongoing outbreaks and 21 individual cases in California. Many of the flareups are emerging in pockets of the country with low vaccination rates, highlighting the perils of not meeting the threshold for herd immunity\u2014the idea that a disease won\u2019t be able to spread if enough people are vaccinated. \u201cThat means the difference between a measles outbreak and no measles outbreak,\u201d said Matthew Daley, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, whose research focuses on vaccinations. \u201cStrategies to improve immunization rates don\u2019t just protect those individuals, they protect folks who can\u2019t get immunized.\u201d\nEarlier this year, more than 40 people came down with the measles in Washington, prompting Gov. Jay Inslee to declare a state of emergency. Clinical vaccination rates in the state for kindergartners fall well below the required 95 percent threshold for herd immunity, hovering around 90 percent and dipping even lower in certain areas. Last week, New York City declared a public health emergency in response to a months-long outbreak in Brooklyn\u2019s Orthodox Jewish community, requiring all unvaccinated individuals to get their shots or potentially face a $1,000 fine.\nCalifornia began tightening the loopholes around vaccine exemptions after a measles outbreak started at Disneyland in December 2014, when 147 people caught the disease. The following year, Pan authored SB 277, which eliminated the personal belief exemption. When Gov. Jerry Brown signed the bill, California became the first state in three decades to successfully tighten its requirements, joining West Virginia and Mississippi as the only three states that do not allow personal or religious exemptions. At first, it seemed like the law was working\u2014immunization rates were above 95 percent in the 2017-18 school year, up from 92.8 percent in the 2015-16 year.\nThere have been 555 cases of measles nationwide so far this year.\nBut in that same time span, the number of medical exemptions more than quadrupled. True medical reasons that prevent a child from being vaccinated do exist, but Daley noted that they are incredibly rare, such as children who are immunocompromised due to leukemia. While it\u2019s possible that the parents of some children with legitimate medical concerns had opted for the easier personal belief exemption, Pan said that the overall patterns in the surge in medical exemptions left him skeptical. Some schools, he said, have vaccination rates in the 70s or lower, while only about 1 percent of children are expected to have legitimate medical conditions preventing vaccination. \u201cThese are not schools of children who have cancer or who just received transplants,\u201d he said.\nIn the 2017-18 school year, more than 4,000 medical exemptions were accepted in California. Around the same time, officials started noticing the emergence of advertisements touting exemptions for a hefty fee. A studyof the law\u2019s implementation, published in the journal Pediatrics, highlighted various instances of malpractice around doctors helping parents obtain faulty exemptions. Some doctors, who did not specialize in pediatrics, family health, or other relevant practice, would give exemptions to patients who they did not regularly see. One investigator told researchers about a physician who charged $300 for a temporary, three-month exemption. \u201cShe used to just give permanent medical exemptions, and now she\u2019s giving temporary for three months,\u201d the health official said. \u201cSo, now families have to go back every three months and pay $300 to get their temporary medical exemption updated. They\u2019re being told you have to renew this every three months. Well, that\u2019s not true it all. It\u2019s a business decision on her part.\u201d\nSome doctors have even become the go-to for vaccine-hesitant parents. A Voice of San Diego investigation found that in the local school district, nearly a third of the 486 exemptions were written by the same doctor.\nIn a San Diego school district, nearly a third of the 486 exemptions were written by the same doctor.\nThe onus is placed on schools to judge whether these exemptions are valid, Daley said. Overwhelmed and underfunded, many don\u2019t have sufficient nursing staff to meet the workload. Rather than have schools be the judge, Pan\u2019s bill would move the enforcement mechanism to a central body, the state department of health. Currently, West Virginia and Mississippi are the only two states that require medical exemptions to be cleared by a central authority. Unsurprisingly, they have some of the highest vaccination rates in the country. (Though both states have seen a push for looser restrictions, bills to resurrect a personal exemption have been introduced in both statehouses.)\nSince it was announced in March, SB 276 has already drawn fierce opposition from the anti-vaccination camp, including a flurry of posts on the Facebook page Californians for Vaccine Choice, a group formed in 2015 to oppose Pan\u2019s first regulation. In a March post, the group called on parents to call their representatives, emphasizing that the \u201cdoctor-patient relationship should be protected\u201d and that \u201cthis is a health issue. Not a vaccine issue.\u201d\nBut Pan noted that the bill is backed by physicians\u2019 groups like the California Medical Association and that the law doesn\u2019t force anyone to vaccinate their child. It simply prevents unvaccinated children from enrolling in school, he said, where the could possibly endanger someone who has a weakened immune system. \u201cFrankly as much as the opposition says we\u2019re trying to limit rights and freedoms, the public deserves to be free to go about the community without worrying about getting exposed to disease,\u201d Pan said. \u201cEvery time a child receives a false medical exemption, when a physician has forgotten their oath, they are putting other children at risk.\u201d",

But the military&rsquo;s tendency to prioritize more immediate threats has been a <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2018/12/this-years-extreme-weather-showed-that-the-pentagon-is-not-ready-for-climate-change/\">recurring problem</a>, especially when the current commander in chief <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/12/trump-climate-timeline/\">believes</a> the scientific consensus around global warming is a hoax.</p>\n<p>Among the many congressional Democrats concerned by this lack of progress is Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a 2020 presidential candidate and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. At least six times in the last two years, Warren has asked senior military leaders to acknowledge the threat posed by climate change. None denied the threat, but unsatisfied with the Pentagon&rsquo;s follow-through, she <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5913294-EWarrenLetterGenDunfordClimateChange.html\">called on</a> Gen. Joseph Dunford, outgoing chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to more explicitly identify the department&rsquo;s approach to combating climate change in a letter released on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This uniformity of opinion among military leaders underscores my concern about the need to act vigorously and expeditiously to mitigate this threat,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;Our military is as capable as anyone of leading the way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Warren&rsquo;s letter doesn&rsquo;t ask the Pentagon to take any specific course of action. Rather the senator wants updates by May 13 from Dunford, who is scheduled to retire <a href=\"https://www.jcs.mil/Media/News/News-Display/Article/1708425/president-intends-to-nominate-milley-to-succeed-dunford-as-chairman/\">in September</a>, on the military&rsquo;s efforts to combat climate change and shore up the safety of its vulnerable installations.</p>\n<p>Since the Obama administration, military leaders have readily acknowledged the dangers of rising seas, wildfires, droughts, and extreme weather&mdash;all conditions <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Reports%20and%20Pubs/Implications_for_US_National_Security_of_Anticipated_Climate_Change.pdf\">that are exacerbated</a> by climate change. The Navy, somewhat by necessity, has led on the issue by <a href=\"https://www.navy.mil/navydata/documents/ccr.pdf\">forming</a> a task force to address the threat and experimenting with ideas like the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/02/navy-climate-change-great-green-fleet/\">Great Green Fleet</a>,&rdquo; which use alternative fuels to power a series of ships. But once Trump took office, even as the military moved forward with certain initiatives like its plan to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/arctic-climate-change-military-russia-china/?utm_term=.ea93537ae3cb\">confront greater threats in the warming Arctic</a>, the impetus to prioritize these programs decreased considerably. &ldquo;Tying things to climate change could invite a scrutiny that was undesired,&rdquo; Rear Adm. Jonathan White, who led the Navy&rsquo;s climate change task force from 2012 to 2015, <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2018/12/this-years-extreme-weather-showed-that-the-pentagon-is-not-ready-for-climate-change/\">told</a> <em>Mother Jones </em>in December.</p>\n<p>Last year&rsquo;s historic hurricane season devastated two crucial military bases&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2018/12/12/36-billion-price-tag-to-rebuild-lejeune-buildings-damaged-by-hurricane-florence/\">Camp Lejeune</a> in North Carolina and <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/11/hurricane-michael-smashed-tyndall-key-air-base-homeland-defense/1601454002/\">Tyndall Air Force Base</a> in Florida&mdash;and cast a spotlight on the consequences of further inaction by the defense establishment, which has grown weary of contradicting Trump. A year into Trump&rsquo;s term, Pentagon officials <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/05/10/pentagon-revised-obama-era-report-to-remove-risks-from-climate-change/?utm_term=.25e5341af69d\">scrubbed nearly two-dozen references</a> to climate change from a draft report and, more recently, <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/01/the-pentagons-new-climate-change-report-is-missing-some-important-details/\">submitted a separate report</a> to Congress that left lawmakers furious over a series of startling omissions. Even though Congress required DOD to rank the ten bases per military service that are most vulnerable thanks to climate change, the report included no such list and left out notable storm-damaged bases like Lejeune and Tyndall. Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services panel, said at the time, &ldquo;The report reads like [an] introductory primer and carries about as much value as a phonebook.&rdquo; (The Pentagon eventually redid the report <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/01/house-democrats-just-told-the-pentagon-to-redo-its-climate-change-report/\">at House Democrats&rsquo; request</a>, but lawmakers were unsatisfied by DOD&rsquo;s repeated decision to omit all Marine Corps bases.)</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Department of Defense must do more than simply acknowledge or take piecemeal action to address climate change while it increasingly threatens and harms our military&rsquo;s infrastructure and operations,&rdquo; Warren wrote. These threats are not just the stuff of hypotheticals. The Marines <a href=\"https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2018/12/12/36-billion-price-tag-to-rebuild-lejeune-buildings-damaged-by-hurricane-florence/\">requested more than $3 billion</a> to rebuild Camp Lejeune while the Air Force <a href=\"https://www.stripes.com/news/us/congress-concerned-about-lack-of-disaster-relief-for-military-bases-devastated-by-hurricanes-1.576505\">has spent hundreds of millions</a> of dollars to renovate Tyndall Air Force Base. If Congress ever agrees to pass a disaster aid package, which has been <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/01/trump-disaster-aid-bill-1246740\">mired in disagreements</a> over how much money to steer toward Puerto Rico, the Marine Corps and Air Force are due to receive even more hurricane-related funding.</p>\n<p>Warren&rsquo;s letter devotes particular concern to the military&rsquo;s failure to act on suggestions already made by an independent government watchdog. In November 2017, the Government Accountability Office made six recommendations to the Pentagon regarding the impact of climate change on overseas installations. DOD only concurred with four of the suggestions, but as of last month, had <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/697245.pdf\">still not acted</a> on any of them. Warren&rsquo;s request to Dunford includes an update on DOD&rsquo;s progress toward meeting the standards set by GAO.</p>\n<p>Read Warren&rsquo;s letter <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5913294-EWarrenLetterGenDunfordClimateChange.html\">here</a>:</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5913294-EWarrenLetterGenDunfordClimateChange.html?embed=true&responsive=false&sidebar=false\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "Of all the federal agencies in Trump\u2019s Washington, the Department of Defense might be the one least equipped to dismiss climate change given its obvious danger to the safety of coastal bases and troops. But the military\u2019s tendency to prioritize more immediate threats has been a recurring problem, especially when the current commander in chief believes the scientific consensus around global warming is a hoax.\nAmong the many congressional Democrats concerned by this lack of progress is Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a 2020 presidential candidate and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. At least six times in the last two years, Warren has asked senior military leaders to acknowledge the threat posed by climate change. None denied the threat, but unsatisfied with the Pentagon\u2019s follow-through, she called on Gen. Joseph Dunford, outgoing chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to more explicitly identify the department\u2019s approach to combating climate change in a letter released on Tuesday.\n\u201cThis uniformity of opinion among military leaders underscores my concern about the need to act vigorously and expeditiously to mitigate this threat,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOur military is as capable as anyone of leading the way.\u201d\nWarren\u2019s letter doesn\u2019t ask the Pentagon to take any specific course of action. Rather the senator wants updates by May 13 from Dunford, who is scheduled to retire in September, on the military\u2019s efforts to combat climate change and shore up the safety of its vulnerable installations.\nSince the Obama administration, military leaders have readily acknowledged the dangers of rising seas, wildfires, droughts, and extreme weather\u2014all conditions that are exacerbated by climate change. The Navy, somewhat by necessity, has led on the issue by forming a task force to address the threat and experimenting with ideas like the \u201cGreat Green Fleet,\u201d which use alternative fuels to power a series of ships. But once Trump took office, even as the military moved forward with certain initiatives like its plan to confront greater threats in the warming Arctic, the impetus to prioritize these programs decreased considerably. \u201cTying things to climate change could invite a scrutiny that was undesired,\u201d Rear Adm. Jonathan White, who led the Navy\u2019s climate change task force from 2012 to 2015, told Mother Jones in December.\nLast year\u2019s historic hurricane season devastated two crucial military bases\u2014Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida\u2014and cast a spotlight on the consequences of further inaction by the defense establishment, which has grown weary of contradicting Trump. A year into Trump\u2019s term, Pentagon officials scrubbed nearly two-dozen references to climate change from a draft report and, more recently, submitted a separate report to Congress that left lawmakers furious over a series of startling omissions. Even though Congress required DOD to rank the ten bases per military service that are most vulnerable thanks to climate change, the report included no such list and left out notable storm-damaged bases like Lejeune and Tyndall. Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), ranking member of the Senate Armed Services panel, said at the time, \u201cThe report reads like [an] introductory primer and carries about as much value as a phonebook.\u201d (The Pentagon eventually redid the report at House Democrats\u2019 request, but lawmakers were unsatisfied by DOD\u2019s repeated decision to omit all Marine Corps bases.)\n\u201cThe Department of Defense must do more than simply acknowledge or take piecemeal action to address climate change while it increasingly threatens and harms our military\u2019s infrastructure and operations,\u201d Warren wrote. These threats are not just the stuff of hypotheticals. The Marines requested more than $3 billion to rebuild Camp Lejeune while the Air Force has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to renovate Tyndall Air Force Base. If Congress ever agrees to pass a disaster aid package, which has been mired in disagreements over how much money to steer toward Puerto Rico, the Marine Corps and Air Force are due to receive even more hurricane-related funding.\nWarren\u2019s letter devotes particular concern to the military\u2019s failure to act on suggestions already made by an independent government watchdog. In November 2017, the Government Accountability Office made six recommendations to the Pentagon regarding the impact of climate change on overseas installations. DOD only concurred with four of the suggestions, but as of last month, had still not acted on any of them. Warren\u2019s request to Dunford includes an update on DOD\u2019s progress toward meeting the standards set by GAO.\nRead Warren\u2019s letter here:",

These beliefs are boosted through the ubiquitousness of social media, and the companies that created these networks are facing increasing pressure to crack down on &ldquo;fake news,&rdquo; conspiracies, and disinformation. Even with some successes on this front, the broader problem has become insidious, and efforts to stem the flood of this brand of information are akin to fighting a mythological Hydra.</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;I started realizing that a lot of people were united in a belief in conspiracy theories because something bad had happened to them.&rdquo;</aside>\n<p>While writer Anna Merlan started her book on conspiracy theories months before we ended up with a conspiracist-in-chief in the White House, <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250159052\"><em>Republic of Lies: American Conspiracy Theorists and Their Surprising Rise to Power</em></a> arguably comes at just the time it&rsquo;s needed the most. Merlan had been covering conspiracy theorists&mdash;subcultures were a specialty of hers&mdash;for alt-weeklies in Dallas and New York for a few years when <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/sail-far-away-at-sea-with-americas-largest-floating-1760900554\">she went on a conspiracy-themed cruise</a> for <em>Jezebel </em>in 2016 at the suggestion of a commenter on the site. It was her first real immersion in the world of conspiracies. &ldquo;I realized that a lot of people were there not just to have a fun kooky time, but were there because they were really deeply in debt and were trying to get out of debt with the help of these sort of self-styled financial experts, or they had children who they believed were injured by vaccines and were seeking the help of this one particular doctor,&rdquo; Merlan says. &ldquo;I started realizing that a lot of people were united in a belief in conspiracy theories because something bad had happened to them, and they were sort of looking for answers that mainstream explanations for things didn&rsquo;t provide.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That led to a years-long deep dive into the world of conspiracy theories. The result is a meticulously researched tome, documenting incidents as early as the burning of ancient Rome and the many conspiracy theories that plagued the 2016 election. <em>Mother Jones</em> talked to Merlan to understand the roots of this increasingly powerful phenomenon and discuss how inequality begets conspiracy theories, how racism is inherent in many of them, and why empathy is important when writing about believers.</p>\n<p><strong>Mother Jones: </strong>Can you lay out what we&rsquo;re talking about when we call something a &ldquo;conspiracy theory&rdquo;?</p>\n<p><strong>Anna Merlan: </strong>When we talk about a conspiracy theory, I use a few different definitions kind of spliced together. It&rsquo;s a belief that a small group of people are working in secret against the common good to create harm, to affect some negative change in society, to seize power for themselves, or to hide a consequential secret. That&rsquo;s a conspiracy theory&mdash;the belief that those things are going on. And so an actual conspiracy is when a small group of people are actually working in secret against the common good. And as I write about in the book, it&rsquo;s not always easy to tell the difference between what is an actual conspiracy and what is just a conspiracy theory.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>You tend to write about conspiracy theorists with a lot of empathy. I think it would have been really easy to write this book with a lot of snark and sarcasm.</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;People who have access to a lot of education or are extremely media savvy are less likely to believe in conspiracy theories, but they&rsquo;re not immune. I don&rsquo;t see myself as particularly different from these people.&rdquo;</aside>\n<p><strong>AM: </strong>There are a bunch of reasons for that. One is that statistically, most Americans believe in at least one conspiracy theory. People who have access to a lot of education or are extremely media savvy are less likely to believe in conspiracy theories, but they&rsquo;re not immune. So I don&rsquo;t see myself as particularly different from these people. I like to say that we&rsquo;re all in the pool, some of us are just in a deeper end of the pool. That was part of the reason to be empathetic. There&rsquo;s so much writing about conspiracy theories and subcultures that is really snarky, and I just think there&rsquo;s been enough of that. I don&rsquo;t think I need to add anything to that genre.</p>\n<p>Some of it too is that I write about this a lot. I think people who get involved in conspiracy theories are often doing it in response to social and economic inequalities. There are conspiracy theories about the health care and financial systems because they&rsquo;re extremely opaque, and people have trouble making sense of this and people feel that they are unjust systems. The anti-vaccine movement, as an example&mdash;I am very frustrated by the misinformation peddled by the leaders of the anti-vaccine movement, but I am very sympathetic to parents who buy into that rhetoric because really, what is more urgent to us than the health of our children? And what do we care more about than keeping them safe?</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>Is there a key element that has to be there to spark a conspiracy theory? I&rsquo;m inclined to think about them as a relatively new phenomenon tied to the internet, rather than something that has always existed.</p>\n<p><strong>AM: </strong>Conspiracy theories are really old. Some conspiracy theories I write about literally go back to ancient Rome. One of the earliest ones we know about was this idea that the fires in ancient Rome that burned most of the city were actually set by the Emperor Nero so he could rebuild the city to his liking.</p>\n<p>I think the main thing that we see that really helps a conspiracy theory catch on is when it provides a satisfying explanation for something. There are a lot of conspiracy theories out there that are extremely fringe and stay really fringe. The ones that tend to enter the lexicon are ones that seem like they provide a meaningful explanation to a lot of people that is in line with their beliefs socially and culturally and politically about how things work. People tend to believe the ones that are already in line with their views.</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;One of the earliest ones we know about was this idea that the fires in ancient Rome that burned most of the city were actually set by the Emperor Nero so that he could rebuild the city to his liking.&rdquo;</aside>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>So how do you think conspiracy theories have shaped American culture and politics specifically?</p>\n<p><strong>AM: </strong>One thing I write about is that conspiracy theories have always been with us and that they got a lot bigger as the federal government got bigger because people rightly began to distrust this entity that got larger and larger and more and more opaque. One thing that we see really commonly in American history is that there&rsquo;s this very strong relationship between conspiracy theorizing and suspicion from the public and actual conspiracies carried out by the government. That relationship got especially stark in the &rsquo;60s and &rsquo;70s, with the disclosure of a bunch of secret programs by the FBI, the CIA, and the military. I write about that time period as having created a trauma that we&rsquo;ve never really gotten over.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>I was really struck by the second chapter where you write about how conspiracy theories that are particularly prominent within the black community are often anchored in very real horrors from the past. Can you walk me through one of those examples?</p>\n<p><strong>AM: </strong>There are a lot of conspiracy theories that are unique to black Americans, and they tend to be really rooted in historical trauma and real historical events. So the example that I start off with is the conspiracy theory that during Hurricane Katrina, the levees didn&rsquo;t fail, that they were actually bombed, and that poor parts of New Orleans were destroyed on purpose. We don&rsquo;t have a lot of evidence of that&mdash;the evidence is a lot more persuasive that the levees did just fail. But what we do know is that that specific conspiracy theory is rooted in a real event&mdash;a 1927 decision to dynamite levees outside of New Orleans, the logic there being that they were going to flood low-lying areas and save the city itself. But that decision displaced people, it killed people, it triggered one of the largest migrations in American history, and it created a lingering sense of suspicion that maybe the government would do this again.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ:</strong> There are a few moments in the book in which you confront people who hold anti-Semitic beliefs and you talk to them about your own identity as a Jewish woman. How did you calculate risk in doing that?</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;There are a lot of conspiracy theories that are unique to black Americans, and they tend to be really rooted in historical trauma and real historical events.&rdquo;</aside>\n<p><strong>AM:</strong> I think it&rsquo;s important to note that I wouldn&rsquo;t sneak into a gathering of neo-Nazis; I wouldn&rsquo;t go see some of the groups who have been linked to murders of Jewish and gay people. I wouldn&rsquo;t feel safe doing that. But in a gathering like the one I was at in Kentucky [where neo-Nazis and white supremacists <a href=\"https://twitter.com/annamerlan/status/858131680099532800\">gathered privately</a> before a rally in Pikeville], where they clearly wanted the press to be there, and they were clearly very eager to be observed and written about by the mainstream press, I decided that that was a pretty good time to allow people to talk to me about anti-Semitic conspiracy theories for a while and then share that I was Jewish and see their response. So it is a calculated level of risk and I definitely also recognize that I have the privilege of being able to go into a space like that and pass unobserved for a while and see how people behave.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>It&rsquo;s also interesting to me how modern-day conspiracy theories seem to have a lot of roots in fears about pedophilia, like <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/12/comet-pizza-suspect-shooters-alex-jones/\">Pizzagate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/03/q-anon-white-house-petition/\">QAnon</a>. Why do you think that is about?</p>\n<p><strong>AM: </strong>I thought about that a lot. Medieval historians have pointed out that Pizzagate looks a lot like this concept of the nocturnal ritual fantasy, this idea that evildoers meet late at night in secret and do bad things or abuse children. The sense that I have is that there are some things that have become archetypal images of hatred or prejudice, and they tend to recur in different ways over and over. Certainly, we see that with anti-Semitic, racist, anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, that they&rsquo;re all rooted in the idea of people as inhuman others who are trying to invade or take over. It really is the same hateful ideas taking on new forms. They&rsquo;re incredibly durable.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>But what do you think makes the pedophilia fixation so prevalent?</p>\n<p><strong>AM: </strong>I think a primary thing about really virulent conspiracy theories is that they create a pathway to hatred and blame. They identify the enemy and they say, &ldquo;This is the person that you need to hate,&rdquo; or &ldquo;This is the person or the group that you can pin the world&rsquo;s ills on.&rdquo; And so one reason, especially on the far right, that the accusations of pedophilia have been recurring so strongly is that it is the worst thing that we can imagine. There is really nothing worse or less socially acceptable than child sexual abuse. And so it is a way to say that these are not just your political opponents&mdash;these are evildoers, these are your enemies, they&rsquo;re barely human, and you can do whatever you need to do to vanquish them.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>It serves as an easy justification.</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;It is a way to say that these are not just your political opponents&mdash;these are evildoers, these are your enemies, they&rsquo;re barely human, and you can do whatever you need to do to vanquish them.&rdquo;</aside>\n<p><strong>AM: </strong>I think it&rsquo;s an easy justification, and the stakes keep getting higher, the accusations keep getting more and more serious. And it&rsquo;s hard for me to think of one that could be more extreme or more damaging than accusations that someone is a pedophile.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>Do you think that the United States was particularly vulnerable to the flood of disinformation around the 2016 election because of our rich history with conspiracy theories?</p>\n<p><strong>AM: </strong>It seems obvious that we were. We can say that because we know that similar disinformation efforts seem to have been attempted by elements within the Russian government, for instance, to interfere with other elections. We know that there were similar disinformation campaigns <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-election-campaign-fake-news-angela-merkel-trump-digital-misinformation/\">in Germany</a>, for example, and they were not successful. The Macron leaks ahead of the French elections <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/09/how-france-beat-back-information-manipulation-and-how-other-democracies-might-do-the-same/\">were also not successful</a>. They barely made a ripple, and this was despite the fact that people on the far right in the US got involved too, and were using their considerable social media reach to try to impact that election.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>Do you think there&rsquo;s anything that people fundamentally misunderstand about the role of the internet here?</p>\n<p><strong>AM: </strong>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s the internet broadly, so much as it is social media specifically. The internet has been around for a while, and it hasn&rsquo;t necessarily made fringe conspiracy theories more mainstream. But I would say that social media does a couple things. First of all, it makes every source of information look the same. When you put a link on Facebook to anything, it looks like any other link on Facebook. So before Facebook started fitfully flagging things as contested news or misinformation, it was very hard to visually decode them as false. It&rsquo;s also that platforms like Twitter create easier avenues for conspiracy theories to go from the fringe to the mainstream&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a lot faster, the pipeline is a lot more streamlined and also, journalists are a lot more likely to see conspiracy theories that are being circulated on Twitter, and then we&rsquo;re more likely to write about them. And there&rsquo;s still some question about whether or not that actually helps them spread. I&rsquo;m not sure what I think about that idea [that news coverage of conspiracy theories can help them spread], but I&rsquo;ve certainly heard it suggested.</p>\n<p>The other thing I would say about the role of social media is that it allows conspiracy theorists to have access to the subjects of their conspiracy theories, which for instance, for <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/a-lobbyist-detectives-strange-quest-to-find-seth-richs-murderer/\">Seth Rich&rsquo;s family</a>, was an extremely devastating experience. It allowed people who wanted to promote false ideas about their family member&rsquo;s death to have direct access to them and try to contact them. And it&rsquo;s the same with families who lose someone in a mass shooting.</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;Social media allowed people who wanted to promote false ideas about their family member&rsquo;s death to have direct access to them and try to contact them.&rdquo; </aside>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>Right, I found the examples you used from the Sandy Hook families to be devastating.</p>\n<p><strong>AM: </strong>The parents who lost their children in Sandy Hook have suffered this secondary tragedy that has gone on for years and years and years, which is the peddlers of these conspiracy theories [the main one being that the children were crisis actors, part of a scheme to allow the government to take away Americans&rsquo; guns] trying to contact them, trying to harass them using photos of their children, and promoting false theories about their children&rsquo;s death using things that they themselves in some cases put on the internet like intimate family photos.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>What responsibility do you think social media companies have to curb conspiracy theories?</p>\n<p><strong>AM: </strong>I really struggle with this a lot. I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ve come up with a good response to it because, for instance, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/09/the-sandy-hook-hoax.html\">Lenny Pozner</a>, who is a Sandy Hook dad, has talked a lot about the need to better regulate the internet. And I completely understand why he thinks that. At the same time, the idea of social media companies like Facebook&mdash;who have a really terrible track record of flagging this information&mdash;having even more power makes me really, really nervous. I think that we have created a problem that is really hard to solve, because we have created such efficient pipelines and it&rsquo;s hard for the pipelines to carry only fresh water and not also garbage and sewage. At the same time, I think we have seen pretty clearly that in some cases, de-platforming some particularly virulent people has worked. I think Alex Jones&rsquo; reach is less than it ever has been, he&rsquo;s getting more criticism for his ideas than he ever has. For somebody like Milo Yiannopoulos or Gavin McInnes&mdash;these are people who got really famous because of platforms like Twitter and Instagram and YouTube&mdash;and not having the same access to those platforms inarguably makes it harder for them to spread what they&rsquo;re trying to spread.</p>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>And what responsibility do we have as journalists?</p>\n<p><strong>AM: </strong>That I&rsquo;m clearer on. I don&rsquo;t think that there is any harm in writing about conspiracy theories, as long as we are writing about them to debunk them. I think that just being snarky about them actually does more harm, so I think that if we&rsquo;re going to write about them, we try to debunk them, and we try to figure out where they&rsquo;re coming from. A lot of what I talked about in the book is the need to figure out an even better sense of what the pipelines are that funnel really ridiculous stories from the outside to the mainstream. So I think as much as we&rsquo;re talking about the content of conspiracy theories, we also want to talk about the pathways that they travel on.</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;We have created such efficient pipelines [of information] and it&rsquo;s hard for the pipelines to carry only fresh water and not also garbage and sewage.&rdquo;</aside>\n<p><strong>MJ: </strong>What surprised you the most in reporting out this book?</p>\n<p><strong>AM: </strong>I think I was really surprised by the empathy I felt for a lot of people and also just how durable their beliefs were even in the face of a lot of conflicting evidence. I sort of knew that, but it was one thing to really see it firsthand. I write in the book about Sean David Morton and his wife, Melissa, who were charged with tax fraud because they had conspiratorial ideas about how the IRS worked. And they sold fraudulent tax schemes to people and they used them themselves. And it really wasn&rsquo;t until the last day of their trial that I was sitting with Mr. Morton and I could see him realizing that his schemes were not going to work, and even then he was sitting there with me outside a courtroom where he was about to be convicted telling me, &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m saying is true, and it should work in court, but they just refuse to do it.&rdquo; I came to see conspiracy theories as much more akin to religion than I had previously.</p>\n<p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>",

                "text": "In many ways, this moment feels like the age of the conspiracy theory\u2014one in which \u201cwellness\u201d schemes are the grift that keeps on giving, a majority of Americans believe there is a \u201cdeep state\u201d meddling with national policy, and a gun-toting man actually showed up to a Washington, DC, pizza parlor to bust politicians he thought were running a child sex trafficking ring in its basement. These beliefs are boosted through the ubiquitousness of social media, and the companies that created these networks are facing increasing pressure to crack down on \u201cfake news,\u201d conspiracies, and disinformation. Even with some successes on this front, the broader problem has become insidious, and efforts to stem the flood of this brand of information are akin to fighting a mythological Hydra.\n\u201cI started realizing that a lot of people were united in a belief in conspiracy theories because something bad had happened to them.\u201d\nWhile writer Anna Merlan started her book on conspiracy theories months before we ended up with a conspiracist-in-chief in the White House, Republic of Lies: American Conspiracy Theorists and Their Surprising Rise to Power arguably comes at just the time it\u2019s needed the most. Merlan had been covering conspiracy theorists\u2014subcultures were a specialty of hers\u2014for alt-weeklies in Dallas and New York for a few years when she went on a conspiracy-themed cruise for Jezebel in 2016 at the suggestion of a commenter on the site. It was her first real immersion in the world of conspiracies. \u201cI realized that a lot of people were there not just to have a fun kooky time, but were there because they were really deeply in debt and were trying to get out of debt with the help of these sort of self-styled financial experts, or they had children who they believed were injured by vaccines and were seeking the help of this one particular doctor,\u201d Merlan says. \u201cI started realizing that a lot of people were united in a belief in conspiracy theories because something bad had happened to them, and they were sort of looking for answers that mainstream explanations for things didn\u2019t provide.\u201d\nThat led to a years-long deep dive into the world of conspiracy theories. The result is a meticulously researched tome, documenting incidents as early as the burning of ancient Rome and the many conspiracy theories that plagued the 2016 election. Mother Jones talked to Merlan to understand the roots of this increasingly powerful phenomenon and discuss how inequality begets conspiracy theories, how racism is inherent in many of them, and why empathy is important when writing about believers.\nMother Jones: Can you lay out what we\u2019re talking about when we call something a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d?\nAnna Merlan: When we talk about a conspiracy theory, I use a few different definitions kind of spliced together. It\u2019s a belief that a small group of people are working in secret against the common good to create harm, to affect some negative change in society, to seize power for themselves, or to hide a consequential secret. That\u2019s a conspiracy theory\u2014the belief that those things are going on. And so an actual conspiracy is when a small group of people are actually working in secret against the common good. And as I write about in the book, it\u2019s not always easy to tell the difference between what is an actual conspiracy and what is just a conspiracy theory.\nMJ: You tend to write about conspiracy theorists with a lot of empathy. I think it would have been really easy to write this book with a lot of snark and sarcasm.\n\u201cPeople who have access to a lot of education or are extremely media savvy are less likely to believe in conspiracy theories, but they\u2019re not immune. I don\u2019t see myself as particularly different from these people.\u201d\nAM: There are a bunch of reasons for that. One is that statistically, most Americans believe in at least one conspiracy theory. People who have access to a lot of education or are extremely media savvy are less likely to believe in conspiracy theories, but they\u2019re not immune. So I don\u2019t see myself as particularly different from these people. I like to say that we\u2019re all in the pool, some of us are just in a deeper end of the pool. That was part of the reason to be empathetic. There\u2019s so much writing about conspiracy theories and subcultures that is really snarky, and I just think there\u2019s been enough of that. I don\u2019t think I need to add anything to that genre.\nSome of it too is that I write about this a lot. I think people who get involved in conspiracy theories are often doing it in response to social and economic inequalities. There are conspiracy theories about the health care and financial systems because they\u2019re extremely opaque, and people have trouble making sense of this and people feel that they are unjust systems. The anti-vaccine movement, as an example\u2014I am very frustrated by the misinformation peddled by the leaders of the anti-vaccine movement, but I am very sympathetic to parents who buy into that rhetoric because really, what is more urgent to us than the health of our children? And what do we care more about than keeping them safe?\nMJ: Is there a key element that has to be there to spark a conspiracy theory? I\u2019m inclined to think about them as a relatively new phenomenon tied to the internet, rather than something that has always existed.\nAM: Conspiracy theories are really old. Some conspiracy theories I write about literally go back to ancient Rome. One of the earliest ones we know about was this idea that the fires in ancient Rome that burned most of the city were actually set by the Emperor Nero so he could rebuild the city to his liking.\nI think the main thing that we see that really helps a conspiracy theory catch on is when it provides a satisfying explanation for something. There are a lot of conspiracy theories out there that are extremely fringe and stay really fringe. The ones that tend to enter the lexicon are ones that seem like they provide a meaningful explanation to a lot of people that is in line with their beliefs socially and culturally and politically about how things work. People tend to believe the ones that are already in line with their views.\n\u201cOne of the earliest ones we know about was this idea that the fires in ancient Rome that burned most of the city were actually set by the Emperor Nero so that he could rebuild the city to his liking.\u201d\nMJ: So how do you think conspiracy theories have shaped American culture and politics specifically?\nAM: One thing I write about is that conspiracy theories have always been with us and that they got a lot bigger as the federal government got bigger because people rightly began to distrust this entity that got larger and larger and more and more opaque. One thing that we see really commonly in American history is that there\u2019s this very strong relationship between conspiracy theorizing and suspicion from the public and actual conspiracies carried out by the government. That relationship got especially stark in the \u201960s and \u201970s, with the disclosure of a bunch of secret programs by the FBI, the CIA, and the military. I write about that time period as having created a trauma that we\u2019ve never really gotten over.\nMJ: I was really struck by the second chapter where you write about how conspiracy theories that are particularly prominent within the black community are often anchored in very real horrors from the past. Can you walk me through one of those examples?\nAM: There are a lot of conspiracy theories that are unique to black Americans, and they tend to be really rooted in historical trauma and real historical events. So the example that I start off with is the conspiracy theory that during Hurricane Katrina, the levees didn\u2019t fail, that they were actually bombed, and that poor parts of New Orleans were destroyed on purpose. We don\u2019t have a lot of evidence of that\u2014the evidence is a lot more persuasive that the levees did just fail. But what we do know is that that specific conspiracy theory is rooted in a real event\u2014a 1927 decision to dynamite levees outside of New Orleans, the logic there being that they were going to flood low-lying areas and save the city itself. But that decision displaced people, it killed people, it triggered one of the largest migrations in American history, and it created a lingering sense of suspicion that maybe the government would do this again.\nMJ: There are a few moments in the book in which you confront people who hold anti-Semitic beliefs and you talk to them about your own identity as a Jewish woman. How did you calculate risk in doing that?\n\u201cThere are a lot of conspiracy theories that are unique to black Americans, and they tend to be really rooted in historical trauma and real historical events.\u201d\nAM: I think it\u2019s important to note that I wouldn\u2019t sneak into a gathering of neo-Nazis; I wouldn\u2019t go see some of the groups who have been linked to murders of Jewish and gay people. I wouldn\u2019t feel safe doing that. But in a gathering like the one I was at in Kentucky [where neo-Nazis and white supremacists gathered privately before a rally in Pikeville], where they clearly wanted the press to be there, and they were clearly very eager to be observed and written about by the mainstream press, I decided that that was a pretty good time to allow people to talk to me about anti-Semitic conspiracy theories for a while and then share that I was Jewish and see their response. So it is a calculated level of risk and I definitely also recognize that I have the privilege of being able to go into a space like that and pass unobserved for a while and see how people behave.\nMJ: It\u2019s also interesting to me how modern-day conspiracy theories seem to have a lot of roots in fears about pedophilia, like Pizzagate and QAnon. Why do you think that is about?\nAM: I thought about that a lot. Medieval historians have pointed out that Pizzagate looks a lot like this concept of the nocturnal ritual fantasy, this idea that evildoers meet late at night in secret and do bad things or abuse children. The sense that I have is that there are some things that have become archetypal images of hatred or prejudice, and they tend to recur in different ways over and over. Certainly, we see that with anti-Semitic, racist, anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, that they\u2019re all rooted in the idea of people as inhuman others who are trying to invade or take over. It really is the same hateful ideas taking on new forms. They\u2019re incredibly durable.\nMJ: But what do you think makes the pedophilia fixation so prevalent?\nAM: I think a primary thing about really virulent conspiracy theories is that they create a pathway to hatred and blame. They identify the enemy and they say, \u201cThis is the person that you need to hate,\u201d or \u201cThis is the person or the group that you can pin the world\u2019s ills on.\u201d And so one reason, especially on the far right, that the accusations of pedophilia have been recurring so strongly is that it is the worst thing that we can imagine. There is really nothing worse or less socially acceptable than child sexual abuse. And so it is a way to say that these are not just your political opponents\u2014these are evildoers, these are your enemies, they\u2019re barely human, and you can do whatever you need to do to vanquish them.\nMJ: It serves as an easy justification.\n\u201cIt is a way to say that these are not just your political opponents\u2014these are evildoers, these are your enemies, they\u2019re barely human, and you can do whatever you need to do to vanquish them.\u201d\nAM: I think it\u2019s an easy justification, and the stakes keep getting higher, the accusations keep getting more and more serious. And it\u2019s hard for me to think of one that could be more extreme or more damaging than accusations that someone is a pedophile.\nMJ: Do you think that the United States was particularly vulnerable to the flood of disinformation around the 2016 election because of our rich history with conspiracy theories?\nAM: It seems obvious that we were. We can say that because we know that similar disinformation efforts seem to have been attempted by elements within the Russian government, for instance, to interfere with other elections. We know that there were similar disinformation campaigns in Germany, for example, and they were not successful. The Macron leaks ahead of the French elections were also not successful. They barely made a ripple, and this was despite the fact that people on the far right in the US got involved too, and were using their considerable social media reach to try to impact that election.\nMJ: Do you think there\u2019s anything that people fundamentally misunderstand about the role of the internet here?\nAM: I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s the internet broadly, so much as it is social media specifically. The internet has been around for a while, and it hasn\u2019t necessarily made fringe conspiracy theories more mainstream. But I would say that social media does a couple things. First of all, it makes every source of information look the same. When you put a link on Facebook to anything, it looks like any other link on Facebook. So before Facebook started fitfully flagging things as contested news or misinformation, it was very hard to visually decode them as false. It\u2019s also that platforms like Twitter create easier avenues for conspiracy theories to go from the fringe to the mainstream\u2014it\u2019s just a lot faster, the pipeline is a lot more streamlined and also, journalists are a lot more likely to see conspiracy theories that are being circulated on Twitter, and then we\u2019re more likely to write about them. And there\u2019s still some question about whether or not that actually helps them spread. I\u2019m not sure what I think about that idea [that news coverage of conspiracy theories can help them spread], but I\u2019ve certainly heard it suggested.\nThe other thing I would say about the role of social media is that it allows conspiracy theorists to have access to the subjects of their conspiracy theories, which for instance, for Seth Rich\u2019s family, was an extremely devastating experience. It allowed people who wanted to promote false ideas about their family member\u2019s death to have direct access to them and try to contact them. And it\u2019s the same with families who lose someone in a mass shooting.\n\u201cSocial media allowed people who wanted to promote false ideas about their family member\u2019s death to have direct access to them and try to contact them.\u201d\nMJ: Right, I found the examples you used from the Sandy Hook families to be devastating.\nAM: The parents who lost their children in Sandy Hook have suffered this secondary tragedy that has gone on for years and years and years, which is the peddlers of these conspiracy theories [the main one being that the children were crisis actors, part of a scheme to allow the government to take away Americans\u2019 guns] trying to contact them, trying to harass them using photos of their children, and promoting false theories about their children\u2019s death using things that they themselves in some cases put on the internet like intimate family photos.\nMJ: What responsibility do you think social media companies have to curb conspiracy theories?\nAM: I really struggle with this a lot. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve come up with a good response to it because, for instance, Lenny Pozner, who is a Sandy Hook dad, has talked a lot about the need to better regulate the internet. And I completely understand why he thinks that. At the same time, the idea of social media companies like Facebook\u2014who have a really terrible track record of flagging this information\u2014having even more power makes me really, really nervous. I think that we have created a problem that is really hard to solve, because we have created such efficient pipelines and it\u2019s hard for the pipelines to carry only fresh water and not also garbage and sewage. At the same time, I think we have seen pretty clearly that in some cases, de-platforming some particularly virulent people has worked. I think Alex Jones\u2019 reach is less than it ever has been, he\u2019s getting more criticism for his ideas than he ever has. For somebody like Milo Yiannopoulos or Gavin McInnes\u2014these are people who got really famous because of platforms like Twitter and Instagram and YouTube\u2014and not having the same access to those platforms inarguably makes it harder for them to spread what they\u2019re trying to spread.\nMJ: And what responsibility do we have as journalists?\nAM: That I\u2019m clearer on. I don\u2019t think that there is any harm in writing about conspiracy theories, as long as we are writing about them to debunk them. I think that just being snarky about them actually does more harm, so I think that if we\u2019re going to write about them, we try to debunk them, and we try to figure out where they\u2019re coming from. A lot of what I talked about in the book is the need to figure out an even better sense of what the pipelines are that funnel really ridiculous stories from the outside to the mainstream. So I think as much as we\u2019re talking about the content of conspiracy theories, we also want to talk about the pathways that they travel on.\n\u201cWe have created such efficient pipelines [of information] and it\u2019s hard for the pipelines to carry only fresh water and not also garbage and sewage.\u201d\nMJ: What surprised you the most in reporting out this book?\nAM: I think I was really surprised by the empathy I felt for a lot of people and also just how durable their beliefs were even in the face of a lot of conflicting evidence. I sort of knew that, but it was one thing to really see it firsthand. I write in the book about Sean David Morton and his wife, Melissa, who were charged with tax fraud because they had conspiratorial ideas about how the IRS worked. And they sold fraudulent tax schemes to people and they used them themselves. And it really wasn\u2019t until the last day of their trial that I was sitting with Mr. Morton and I could see him realizing that his schemes were not going to work, and even then he was sitting there with me outside a courtroom where he was about to be convicted telling me, \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is true, and it should work in court, but they just refuse to do it.\u201d I came to see conspiracy theories as much more akin to religion than I had previously.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.",

As part of the settlements, Facebook has promised to make significant changes to its ad tools to curb the ability of advertisers to target users based on their race, gender, age, disability, and other protected characteristics.</p>\n<p>Facebook has become a peerless source of demographic data for advertisers. The information it gathers on its users allows advertisers to target ads for their products and services to an unprecedented level of precision. If you want to sell baseball gear in Washington, DC, for example, you can target middle-aged mothers with children who live in a wealthy ZIP code. But for years, civil rights groups have been warning Facebook&mdash;first in conversations, then in a series of lawsuits&mdash;that this hyper-targeting can run afoul of civil rights laws.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Facebook announced settlements with the National Fair Housing Alliance, the Communications Workers of America, regional fair housing organizations, and individual consumers and job seekers, represented by the ACLU and two civil rights firms across five different cases over ad discrimination on the platform. Without admitting wrongdoing, Facebook agreed to major changes to its targeting tools for ads in industries protected by federal civil rights laws: housing, employment, and credit.</p>\n<p>While it&rsquo;s legal to market baseball caps to men, for example, federal civil rights laws prohibit targeting ads for housing, employment, and loans based on protected characteristics like race, gender, age, and disability. On October 31, 2016, <em>ProPublica </em>published a bombshell <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race\">investigation</a> showing that advertisers could target ads in protected industries by race. A job ad might be shown just to white men, for example. The following month, the first civil rights lawsuit against Facebook was filed in California, a class-action suit on behalf of the millions of people of color who were missing out on opportunities for housing, jobs, and credit due to Facebook&rsquo;s ad tools.</p>\n<p>In February 2017, Facebook announced that it had removed the ability to target groups in these three protected areas. But a subsequent <em>ProPublica</em> investigation in November 2017 showed that Facebook&rsquo;s fix didn&rsquo;t work: Reporters had successfully placed rental housing ads that excluded protected groups of people, including African Americans, Jews, Spanish speakers, and people interested in wheelchair ramps. This <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin\">second story</a> prompted another <a href=\"https://nationalfairhousing.org/2018/03/27/facebook-sued-by-civil-rights-groups-for-discrimination-in-online-housing-advertisements/\">major suit</a> by fair housing advocates in New York. The following year, the ACLU and the Communications Workers of America filed two complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over gender and age discrimination in employment ads. On Tuesday, Facebook settled with all of them.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is a long history of discrimination in the areas of housing, employment, and credit, and this harmful behavior should not happen through Facebook ads,&rdquo; Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote in blog post announcing the changes, adding, &ldquo;We can do better.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Facebook&lsquo;s lawyers initially moved to have the cases against it dismissed. In April 2018, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress, multiple lawmakers pressed him on the <em>ProPublica</em> stories and Facebook&rsquo;s decision to fight the suits. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) pressed Zuckerberg to explain how, as Facebook&rsquo;s court filings claimed, people who were excluded from job advertisements were not being harmed. Zuckerberg acknowledged at the time that protecting people from illegal ad discrimination practices was a work in progress.</p>\n<p>Since that hearing, Facebook has agreed to a civil rights audit, a holistic review of possible civil rights issues on its platform. It has hired Laura Murphy, the former head of the ACLU in Washington, to lead the project. Sandberg cited this audit in Facebook&rsquo;s decision to settle the cases. &ldquo;Civil rights leaders and experts&mdash;including members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and Laura Murphy, the highly respected civil rights leader who is overseeing the Facebook civil rights audit&mdash;have also raised valid concerns about this issue,&rdquo; she wrote in her blog post. &ldquo;We take those concerns seriously and, as part of our civil rights audit, engaged the noted civil rights law firm Relman, Dane &amp; Colfax to review our ads tools and help us understand what more we could do to guard against misuse.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But if Facebook has finally decided to take this issue seriously, promising to roll out a series of changes this year to dramatically reduce the ad targeting options in these protected categories, it did so under the threat of litigation. The Justice Department had sided with the fair housing advocates in the New York suit. If Facebook had not settled the cases in California and New York and instead had lost in court, it could have faced greater liability for the content published on its platform.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As the internet&mdash;and platforms like Facebook&mdash;play an increasing role in connecting us all to information related to economic opportunities, it&rsquo;s crucial that micro-targeting not be used to exclude groups that already face discrimination,&rdquo; Galen Sherwin, senior staff attorney at the ACLU, said in a statement Tuesday. &ldquo;We are pleased Facebook has agreed to take meaningful steps to ensure that discriminatory advertising practices are not given new life in the digital era, and we expect other tech companies to follow Facebook&rsquo;s lead.&rdquo; Beyond Facebook, civil rights groups hope that the settlement will create a benchmark for the rest of Silicon Valley when it comes to ad discrimination.</p>\n<p>As part of the settlement, Facebook will create a separate portal for ads in the areas of housing, employment, and credit that will limit the number of targeting categories available to advertisers. In addition, the parties who filed the suits and complaints will continue to work with Facebook for three years to monitor the effects of the changes and study the potential for unintended biases in its algorithms. And Facebook will make changes to one way it develops target audiences for an ad so that it is no longer taking protected classes like race and gender into account when it creates an audience for an advertiser.</p>\n<p>Despite these big changes, Aaron Rieke, the managing director at Upturn, a nonprofit that researches the intersection of technology and discrimination, says they don&rsquo;t go far enough. &ldquo;These are real improvements, but it&rsquo;s also not a complete answer to the problem,&rdquo; Rieki says. &ldquo;The potential for discrimination still exists here, certainly.&rdquo; Upturn submitted a brief in the California class-action case highlighting the ways Facebook&rsquo;s algorithms and tools can inadvertently discriminate. In those areas, Rieke believes the settlements fall short.</p>\n<p>But Morgan Williams, general counsel for the National Fair Housing Alliance, which sued in New York, praised the settlement resulting from that suit. &ldquo;The agreement will set a new standard across the tech industry concerning company policies that intersect with civil rights,&rdquo; Williams said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased with the settlement because it involves Facebook making broad and unprecedented changes to its platform.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Facebook has reached settlements in three civil rights cases and two complaints before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over ad discrimination on its platform. As part of the settlements, Facebook has promised to make significant changes to its ad tools to curb the ability of advertisers to target users based on their race, gender, age, disability, and other protected characteristics.\nFacebook has become a peerless source of demographic data for advertisers. The information it gathers on its users allows advertisers to target ads for their products and services to an unprecedented level of precision. If you want to sell baseball gear in Washington, DC, for example, you can target middle-aged mothers with children who live in a wealthy ZIP code. But for years, civil rights groups have been warning Facebook\u2014first in conversations, then in a series of lawsuits\u2014that this hyper-targeting can run afoul of civil rights laws.\nOn Tuesday, Facebook announced settlements with the National Fair Housing Alliance, the Communications Workers of America, regional fair housing organizations, and individual consumers and job seekers, represented by the ACLU and two civil rights firms across five different cases over ad discrimination on the platform. Without admitting wrongdoing, Facebook agreed to major changes to its targeting tools for ads in industries protected by federal civil rights laws: housing, employment, and credit.\nWhile it\u2019s legal to market baseball caps to men, for example, federal civil rights laws prohibit targeting ads for housing, employment, and loans based on protected characteristics like race, gender, age, and disability. On October 31, 2016, ProPublica published a bombshell investigation showing that advertisers could target ads in protected industries by race. A job ad might be shown just to white men, for example. The following month, the first civil rights lawsuit against Facebook was filed in California, a class-action suit on behalf of the millions of people of color who were missing out on opportunities for housing, jobs, and credit due to Facebook\u2019s ad tools.\nIn February 2017, Facebook announced that it had removed the ability to target groups in these three protected areas. But a subsequent ProPublica investigation in November 2017 showed that Facebook\u2019s fix didn\u2019t work: Reporters had successfully placed rental housing ads that excluded protected groups of people, including African Americans, Jews, Spanish speakers, and people interested in wheelchair ramps. This second story prompted another major suit by fair housing advocates in New York. The following year, the ACLU and the Communications Workers of America filed two complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over gender and age discrimination in employment ads. On Tuesday, Facebook settled with all of them.\n\u201cThere is a long history of discrimination in the areas of housing, employment, and credit, and this harmful behavior should not happen through Facebook ads,\u201d Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote in blog post announcing the changes, adding, \u201cWe can do better.\u201d\nFacebook\u2018s lawyers initially moved to have the cases against it dismissed. In April 2018, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress, multiple lawmakers pressed him on the ProPublica stories and Facebook\u2019s decision to fight the suits. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) pressed Zuckerberg to explain how, as Facebook\u2019s court filings claimed, people who were excluded from job advertisements were not being harmed. Zuckerberg acknowledged at the time that protecting people from illegal ad discrimination practices was a work in progress.\nSince that hearing, Facebook has agreed to a civil rights audit, a holistic review of possible civil rights issues on its platform. It has hired Laura Murphy, the former head of the ACLU in Washington, to lead the project. Sandberg cited this audit in Facebook\u2019s decision to settle the cases. \u201cCivil rights leaders and experts\u2014including members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and Laura Murphy, the highly respected civil rights leader who is overseeing the Facebook civil rights audit\u2014have also raised valid concerns about this issue,\u201d she wrote in her blog post. \u201cWe take those concerns seriously and, as part of our civil rights audit, engaged the noted civil rights law firm Relman, Dane & Colfax to review our ads tools and help us understand what more we could do to guard against misuse.\u201d\nBut if Facebook has finally decided to take this issue seriously, promising to roll out a series of changes this year to dramatically reduce the ad targeting options in these protected categories, it did so under the threat of litigation. The Justice Department had sided with the fair housing advocates in the New York suit. If Facebook had not settled the cases in California and New York and instead had lost in court, it could have faced greater liability for the content published on its platform.\n\u201cAs the internet\u2014and platforms like Facebook\u2014play an increasing role in connecting us all to information related to economic opportunities, it\u2019s crucial that micro-targeting not be used to exclude groups that already face discrimination,\u201d Galen Sherwin, senior staff attorney at the ACLU, said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cWe are pleased Facebook has agreed to take meaningful steps to ensure that discriminatory advertising practices are not given new life in the digital era, and we expect other tech companies to follow Facebook\u2019s lead.\u201d Beyond Facebook, civil rights groups hope that the settlement will create a benchmark for the rest of Silicon Valley when it comes to ad discrimination.\nAs part of the settlement, Facebook will create a separate portal for ads in the areas of housing, employment, and credit that will limit the number of targeting categories available to advertisers. In addition, the parties who filed the suits and complaints will continue to work with Facebook for three years to monitor the effects of the changes and study the potential for unintended biases in its algorithms. And Facebook will make changes to one way it develops target audiences for an ad so that it is no longer taking protected classes like race and gender into account when it creates an audience for an advertiser.\nDespite these big changes, Aaron Rieke, the managing director at Upturn, a nonprofit that researches the intersection of technology and discrimination, says they don\u2019t go far enough. \u201cThese are real improvements, but it\u2019s also not a complete answer to the problem,\u201d Rieki says. \u201cThe potential for discrimination still exists here, certainly.\u201d Upturn submitted a brief in the California class-action case highlighting the ways Facebook\u2019s algorithms and tools can inadvertently discriminate. In those areas, Rieke believes the settlements fall short.\nBut Morgan Williams, general counsel for the National Fair Housing Alliance, which sued in New York, praised the settlement resulting from that suit. \u201cThe agreement will set a new standard across the tech industry concerning company policies that intersect with civil rights,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased with the settlement because it involves Facebook making broad and unprecedented changes to its platform.\u201d",

But less than six months after the historic move, state lawmakers are considering legislation that would make it harder for some of them to vote by requiring them to first finish paying all court fines and fees.</p>\n<p>Before the ballot measure went into effect in January, Florida was one of only four states that permanently blocked former felons from participating in elections, a policy that traced back to the Jim Crow era and kept 10 percent of Floridians&mdash;and 1 in 5 African Americans in the state&mdash;off the rolls. Amendment 4 restored voting rights to Florida citizens with felony records who had completed their sentences (except for those who were convicted of murder or sex crimes).</p>\n<p>State lawmakers now argue that aspects of Amendment 4 are confusing and require clarification. On Tuesday, a House subcommittee <a href=\"https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2019/03/18/5c900d5ae4b0d50544fedb4f.pdf\">approved a bill</a> that would prevent people with felony records from voting until they finish paying all court fines and fees, including <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2011/948.09\">&ldquo;any cost of supervision</a>&rdquo; like parole, even if those fines and fees were not spelled out by a judge as part of the person&rsquo;s original sentence. Previously, people with felony records only had to pay back restitution to a victim to get their rights restored, according to the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em>.</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s blatantly unconstitutional as a poll tax,&rdquo; Rep. Adam Hattersley said.</aside>\n<p>The bill was introduced last Friday and passed out of committee along party lines, with Republicans in favor. The Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, a group that pushed for Amendment 4, <a href=\"https://floridarrc.com/a4-under-attack/\">slammed</a> it as an &ldquo;unconstitutional overreach&rdquo; that &ldquo;would restrict the number of people who would otherwise be eligible to vote.&rdquo; Others argue the bill would unfairly burden low-income people who can&rsquo;t afford to repay all their fines. &ldquo;This will inevitably prevent individuals from voting based on the size of one&rsquo;s bank account,&rdquo; Kirk Baily, a political director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said in a <a href=\"https://www.aclufl.org/en/press-releases/aclu-florida-statement-house-bill-restricting-amendment-4\">statement</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s blatantly unconstitutional as a poll tax,&rdquo; Rep. Adam Hattersley (D-Riverview) <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/2019/03/19/house-committee-passes-amendment-4-bill-along-party-lines/\">told</a> the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em>.</p>\n<p>Republicans dismissed that characterization. &ldquo;To suggest that this is a poll tax inherently diminishes the atrocity of what a poll tax actually was,&rdquo; state Rep. James Grant, chairman of Florida&rsquo;s House criminal justice subcommittee, told the newspaper. Grant argued the bill was also needed to clarify other &ldquo;super-ambiguous&rdquo; aspects of Amendment 4, including which offenses qualify as sex crimes.</p>\n<p>Florida&rsquo;s felon disenfranchisement policies have racist roots that began after the Civil War, as <em>Mother Jones</em>&lsquo; Ari Berman explained in a <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/10/inside-the-unlikely-movement-that-could-restore-voting-rights-to-1-4-million-floridians/\">deep dive</a> about Amendment 4 before it passed in November:</p>\n<blockquote><p>After the Civil War, the white Confederates who still controlled Florida had a problem: The state had been forced to accept the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments, which guaranteed equal rights for newly freed slaves, in order to rejoin the Union, and now black registered voters outnumbered white ones. White Floridians <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/Florida_Voting_Rights_Outlier.pdf\">responded</a> by adopting a constitution in 1868 that disenfranchised anyone with a felony conviction and added to the felony roster a variety of crimes they believed African Americans were likelier to be convicted of. One Republican leader said the law would keep the state from becoming &ldquo;niggerized.&rdquo; A decade later, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/d/download_file_38222.pdf\">more than 95 percent</a> of people in Florida&rsquo;s convict camps were African Americans.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Today, Florida is one of the country&rsquo;s most important swing states&mdash;lending extra weight to the issue of who gets to vote, especially for Republicans. According to an <a href=\"https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/faculty/documents/Democratic_Contraction.pdf\">academic study</a> of the 2000 presidential election, Al Gore would have defeated George W. Bush by as many as 60,000 votes in Florida if it weren&rsquo;t for felony disenfranchisement policies. In 2007, when then-Gov. Charlie Crist, a moderate Republican who later became a Democrat, decided to restore voting rights to 40,000 people with felony records, about 60 percent of them registered as Democrats.</p>\n<p>As the bill moves out of committee for broader consideration, advocates of Amendment 4 are urging state lawmakers to amend it and remove financial barriers to voting. &ldquo;For the millions of us who are impacted by Amendment 4, we will fight any measure that denies people their constitutional rights,&rdquo; Desmond Meade and Neil Volz, advocates with the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition who both registered to vote because of the ballot measure, wrote in an <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/column-dont-let-politicians-stop-amendment-4s-clear-intent-20190318/\">op-ed</a>. &ldquo;We will do that now, we will do that in 2020, and we will do that beyond.</p>",

                "text": "Last November, Florida passed a ballot measure to reenfranchise as many as 1.4 million people with felony records, the largest expansion of voting rights in decades. But less than six months after the historic move, state lawmakers are considering legislation that would make it harder for some of them to vote by requiring them to first finish paying all court fines and fees.\nBefore the ballot measure went into effect in January, Florida was one of only four states that permanently blocked former felons from participating in elections, a policy that traced back to the Jim Crow era and kept 10 percent of Floridians\u2014and 1 in 5 African Americans in the state\u2014off the rolls. Amendment 4 restored voting rights to Florida citizens with felony records who had completed their sentences (except for those who were convicted of murder or sex crimes).\nState lawmakers now argue that aspects of Amendment 4 are confusing and require clarification. On Tuesday, a House subcommittee approved a bill that would prevent people with felony records from voting until they finish paying all court fines and fees, including \u201cany cost of supervision\u201d like parole, even if those fines and fees were not spelled out by a judge as part of the person\u2019s original sentence. Previously, people with felony records only had to pay back restitution to a victim to get their rights restored, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\u201cIt\u2019s blatantly unconstitutional as a poll tax,\u201d Rep. Adam Hattersley said.\nThe bill was introduced last Friday and passed out of committee along party lines, with Republicans in favor. The Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, a group that pushed for Amendment 4, slammed it as an \u201cunconstitutional overreach\u201d that \u201cwould restrict the number of people who would otherwise be eligible to vote.\u201d Others argue the bill would unfairly burden low-income people who can\u2019t afford to repay all their fines. \u201cThis will inevitably prevent individuals from voting based on the size of one\u2019s bank account,\u201d Kirk Baily, a political director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s blatantly unconstitutional as a poll tax,\u201d Rep. Adam Hattersley (D-Riverview) told the Tampa Bay Times.\nRepublicans dismissed that characterization. \u201cTo suggest that this is a poll tax inherently diminishes the atrocity of what a poll tax actually was,\u201d state Rep. James Grant, chairman of Florida\u2019s House criminal justice subcommittee, told the newspaper. Grant argued the bill was also needed to clarify other \u201csuper-ambiguous\u201d aspects of Amendment 4, including which offenses qualify as sex crimes.\nFlorida\u2019s felon disenfranchisement policies have racist roots that began after the Civil War, as Mother Jones\u2018 Ari Berman explained in a deep dive about Amendment 4 before it passed in November:\nAfter the Civil War, the white Confederates who still controlled Florida had a problem: The state had been forced to accept the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments, which guaranteed equal rights for newly freed slaves, in order to rejoin the Union, and now black registered voters outnumbered white ones. White Floridians responded by adopting a constitution in 1868 that disenfranchised anyone with a felony conviction and added to the felony roster a variety of crimes they believed African Americans were likelier to be convicted of. One Republican leader said the law would keep the state from becoming \u201cniggerized.\u201d A decade later, more than 95 percent of people in Florida\u2019s convict camps were African Americans.\nToday, Florida is one of the country\u2019s most important swing states\u2014lending extra weight to the issue of who gets to vote, especially for Republicans. According to an academic study of the 2000 presidential election, Al Gore would have defeated George W. Bush by as many as 60,000 votes in Florida if it weren\u2019t for felony disenfranchisement policies. In 2007, when then-Gov. Charlie Crist, a moderate Republican who later became a Democrat, decided to restore voting rights to 40,000 people with felony records, about 60 percent of them registered as Democrats.\nAs the bill moves out of committee for broader consideration, advocates of Amendment 4 are urging state lawmakers to amend it and remove financial barriers to voting. \u201cFor the millions of us who are impacted by Amendment 4, we will fight any measure that denies people their constitutional rights,\u201d Desmond Meade and Neil Volz, advocates with the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition who both registered to vote because of the ballot measure, wrote in an op-ed. \u201cWe will do that now, we will do that in 2020, and we will do that beyond.",

In June 2017, Conway said he withdrew himself from consideration for the post and told Yahoo News months later that he did so because he had viewed the Trump administration as a \u201cshitshow in a dumpster fire.\u201d\nConway on Tuesday responded to Trump\u2019s insult with glee, sarcastically congratulating the president for boosting his tweets about the president\u2019s supposed mental deterioration.\nCongratulations! You just guaranteed that millions of more people are going to learn about narcissistic personality disorder and malignant narcissism!

She was diagnosed with appendicitis and told she needed surgery as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>She rushed to a nearby hospital, Swedish Medical Center &mdash; but first called ahead <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/it-s-time-get-second-opinion-paying-medical-bill-n545626\">to make sure it took her insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>When the hospital said yes, Briggs thought that meant she was covered. &quot;I thought [that meant] the anesthesiologist takes my insurance,&quot; she said, &quot;that the surgeon [does], that the nurse, you know, that that's all part of the same deal.&quot;</p>\n<p>But two months after the surgery, she got <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/unexpected-medical-bills-worry-americans-most-paying-care-n906696\">a whopping bill</a> for $4,727 from the surgeon, Dr. Emmett McGuire. Like most of the doctors at<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hospitals-list-procedure-prices-under-new-law-what-you-need-n952686\"> the hospital</a>, McGuire practiced independently.

Two years later, a collection agency slapped a lien on her home, which would block her ability to sell her house until she paid off the debt.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's really scary,&quot; Briggs said. &quot;This is all we have, and to think that it could all be taken away, because some doctor doesn't feel like taking anyone's insurance is &mdash; it's just so wrong.&quot;</p>\n<p>She isn't the only one facing this &quot;scary&quot; reality. <a href=\"https://www.9news.com/article/news/investigations/medical-cost/how-you-can-visit-the-hospital-then-get-a-lien-on-your-home/73-611424288\">NBC's Denver affiliate KUSA</a> worked for months on a series about surprise medical bills, and found that since 2017, just one collection agency had put liens on 170 local homes. When NBC News contacted Credit Systems, Inc., the company declined to comment.</p>\n<p>NBC News dug further and found similar cases of liens on homes because of unpaid medical bills in at least five other states: New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma and Vermont.</p>\n<p>Surprise medical bills like the one Briggs received in the mail can easily lead to these liens. A <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-late-summer-2018-the-election-pre-existing-conditions-and-surprises-on-medical-bills/\">recent poll</a> by Kaiser Family Foundation found that four in 10 Americans have received <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/americans-ready-crack-down-drug-prices-force-some-skip-doses-n978296\">a surprise</a> medical bill.</p>\n<p>&quot;I find this really unconscionable,&quot; said Dr. Ashish Jha, a health policy professor at Harvard's Chan School of Public Health. &quot;This is really a failure of our system to stick people with these kinds of bills that really have no justification whatsoever.&quot;</p>\n<p>Briggs says that when she got to Swedish Hospital Center for her surgery three years ago, she asked again and again to be sure she was fully covered. Even after she was told the hospital took her insurance, she says she kept asking &mdash; more than a dozen times.</p>\n<p>What she didn't ask explicitly is whether the surgeon was covered.</p>\n<p>When she got her surprise bill for $4,727, she says she called her insurance company to explain the situation. She hoped it would <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/after-her-skiing-accident-uphill-battle-over-snowballing-bills-n949426\">pay the bill</a>, but the company told her she was on the hook for the full amount and would have to pay it.</p>\n<p>&quot;I was so frustrated with it,&quot; Briggs recalled. &quot;I thought, 'I'm just going to let this die in collections. I'm not going to pay this.'&quot;</p>\n<p>But the bill didn't die. Instead it kept collecting interest, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/hefty-surprise-medical-bills-can-be-burden-families-n572321\">growing to $5,802.08.</a> Two years later, a collection agency called Credit Systems, Inc. took her to court representing the surgeon. The company sued her for the new amount and won.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LfB-pUUAAAAACholya1Laf2TuFO8pyhvTcnoG0A&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb206NDQz&hl=en&v=vJuUWXolyYJx1oqUVmpPuryQ&theme=light&size=invisible&badge=bottomright&cb=99d6wg1jb2k\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Then came a letter in the mail announcing the lien on her home. Soon after, the collection agency started garnishing her wages by 25 percent every month, forcing her to pay it off. Pregnant and about to go on maternity leave, she worried she wouldn't be able to afford the pay cut.</p>\n<p>Several health policy experts agreed that all parties share blame in the system:<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/surprise-medical-bills-found-22-percent-er-visits-n684956\"> the doctors, insurance companies and hospitals.</a> Doctors can charge much higher prices for out-of-network care if they don't accept insurance. Insurance companies might negotiate service rates that are not competitive enough for doctors and hospitals to conduct their business. That could lead doctors to charge patients those out-of-network rates.</p>\n<p>&quot;Patients have no way of knowing this upfront before it happens,&quot; said Jha. &quot;Physician groups see this as a way to make extra money on the backs of patients and I think that's a very serious problem.&quot;</p>\n<p>Hospitals are on the hook as well. They often contract out-of-network doctors, especially for emergency care providers like surgeons, anesthesiologists and radiologists who are needed around the clock. Plus, hospitals are not required to track providers' insurance networks.</p>\n<p>But they know doctors are charging out-of-network, said Jha.</p>\n<p>&quot;Hospitals have an obligation to make sure that every doctor who works within their walls is generating bills that either are part of the insurance that patients have or are things that patients can afford,&quot; Jha said.</p>\n<p>In Briggs's case, Swedish Medical Center, the hospital where she was treated, said the vast majority of its physicians practice independently, which is true of most hospitals in Colorado and many others across the country.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/patients-hit-with-surprise-medical-bills-even-with-insurance-it-s-really-scary-1461066307688\"><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1240px)\" srcset=\"https://media13.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201903/x_nn_sgo_medical_bills_early_clip_190319.focal-860x484.jpg\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 758px)\" srcset=\"https://media13.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201903/x_nn_sgo_medical_bills_early_clip_190319.focal-1000x563.jpg\"></source><img src=\"https://media13.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201903/x_nn_sgo_medical_bills_early_clip_190319.focal-760x428.jpg\"></img></picture></a></figure>\n<p>Swedish Medical Center said in a statement that it cannot compel these independent doctors to accept the same insurance plans that the hospital does. &quot;We strongly encourage those independent physicians to participate in the same insurance networks as we do; however, ultimately those negotiations occur between the individual providers and insurers, not hospitals.&quot;</p>\n<p>McGuire, the surgeon who performed Briggs' appendectomy, said he's in-network for more than three quarters of his patients and that his billing company works to help patients secure payment and appeal denials from their insurance companies.</p>\n<p>&quot;When an insured patient's bill winds up in the legal system, which only happens one tenth of one percent of the time, that insurance company has put the patient in an impossible position, often by refusing to acknowledge that the surgery was emergency care,&quot; he said. &quot;The insurance companies hold the power to resolve these issues, and for whatever reason, they choose not to.&quot;</p>\n<p>After Briggs told her story on KUSA last November, McGuire instructed his billing company to change its collection practices, stopping all future legal proceedings against insured patients who received care that their insurance company did not cover.</p>\n<p>Briggs' insurance case worker, who dealt with her billing issues on behalf of the insurance company after Briggs received the surprise bill, declined to comment.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/surprise-medical-bills-lead-liens-homes-crippling-debt-n984371\">A shared responsibility</a></h3>\n<p>The issue goes beyond one patient receiving a surprise bill from one doctor at one hospital in Denver. Colorado legislators are already working to stop physicians from billing patients who receive care at in-network hospitals that accept their insurance plans.</p>\n<p>A lawyer for the state association of collection agencies said in a statement that the trade group and Credit Systems, Inc., the collection firm that pursued payment from Briggs, both &quot;[support] changes in the law now pending in the Colorado General Assembly that would address the issue of these billings.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;These cases are challenging for those tasked with collecting the claims as well,&quot; said the statement.</p>\n<p>Katherine Mulready, chief strategy officer of the Colorado Hospital Association, recognizes that there are many faults in the system and that hospitals have a shared responsibility to do something about these surprise bills &mdash; like telling patients they might be treated by an out-of-network doctor.</p>\n<p>&quot;That is absolutely an obligation we are willing to make as hospitals,&quot; Mulready said, but it is not the only issue.</p>\n<p>&quot;There is a mutual dependence between hospitals and physicians, and not all physicians, but certain types of physicians,&quot; Mulready said. &quot;We don't always have the ability to tell physicians how they should run their businesses at the end of the day.&quot;</p>\n<p>On the national level, there is agreement from all parties involved, including the American Hospital Association and the lead insurance industry trade group, America's Health Insurance Plans, on the need for a federal fix.</p>\n<p>And there's widespread <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/law-aims-protect-medicare-patients-surprise-hospital-bill-n730686\">bipartisan support </a>to do just that. Three bills are currently circulating in Congress, all aiming to put an end to surprise medical billing through different approaches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Discussion%20Draft-%20Protecting%20Patients%20from%20Surprise%20Medical%20Bills%20Act.pdf\">A draft bill</a> in the works would ban balance billing, when a patient is expected to pay the difference between what the doctor charged and what the insurance paid.

                "text": "MORRISON, Colo. \u2014 When Nicole Briggs felt intense stomach pain one night three years ago, she went to a freestanding ER near her home in the Denver suburbs. She was diagnosed with appendicitis and told she needed surgery as soon as possible.\nShe rushed to a nearby hospital, Swedish Medical Center \u2014 but first called ahead to make sure it took her insurance.\nWhen the hospital said yes, Briggs thought that meant she was covered. \"I thought [that meant] the anesthesiologist takes my insurance,\" she said, \"that the surgeon [does], that the nurse, you know, that that's all part of the same deal.\"\nBut two months after the surgery, she got a whopping bill for $4,727 from the surgeon, Dr. Emmett McGuire. Like most of the doctors at the hospital, McGuire practiced independently. He did not take her insurance.\nShe declined to pay the bill. Two years later, a collection agency slapped a lien on her home, which would block her ability to sell her house until she paid off the debt.\n\"It's really scary,\" Briggs said. \"This is all we have, and to think that it could all be taken away, because some doctor doesn't feel like taking anyone's insurance is \u2014 it's just so wrong.\"\nShe isn't the only one facing this \"scary\" reality. NBC's Denver affiliate KUSA worked for months on a series about surprise medical bills, and found that since 2017, just one collection agency had put liens on 170 local homes. When NBC News contacted Credit Systems, Inc., the company declined to comment.\nNBC News dug further and found similar cases of liens on homes because of unpaid medical bills in at least five other states: New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma and Vermont.\nSurprise medical bills like the one Briggs received in the mail can easily lead to these liens. A recent poll by Kaiser Family Foundation found that four in 10 Americans have received a surprise medical bill.\n\"I find this really unconscionable,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, a health policy professor at Harvard's Chan School of Public Health. \"This is really a failure of our system to stick people with these kinds of bills that really have no justification whatsoever.\"\nBriggs says that when she got to Swedish Hospital Center for her surgery three years ago, she asked again and again to be sure she was fully covered. Even after she was told the hospital took her insurance, she says she kept asking \u2014 more than a dozen times.\nWhat she didn't ask explicitly is whether the surgeon was covered.\nWhen she got her surprise bill for $4,727, she says she called her insurance company to explain the situation. She hoped it would pay the bill, but the company told her she was on the hook for the full amount and would have to pay it.\n\"I was so frustrated with it,\" Briggs recalled. \"I thought, 'I'm just going to let this die in collections. I'm not going to pay this.'\"\nBut the bill didn't die. Instead it kept collecting interest, growing to $5,802.08. Two years later, a collection agency called Credit Systems, Inc. took her to court representing the surgeon. The company sued her for the new amount and won.\nThen came a letter in the mail announcing the lien on her home. Soon after, the collection agency started garnishing her wages by 25 percent every month, forcing her to pay it off. Pregnant and about to go on maternity leave, she worried she wouldn't be able to afford the pay cut.\nSeveral health policy experts agreed that all parties share blame in the system: the doctors, insurance companies and hospitals. Doctors can charge much higher prices for out-of-network care if they don't accept insurance. Insurance companies might negotiate service rates that are not competitive enough for doctors and hospitals to conduct their business. That could lead doctors to charge patients those out-of-network rates.\n\"Patients have no way of knowing this upfront before it happens,\" said Jha. \"Physician groups see this as a way to make extra money on the backs of patients and I think that's a very serious problem.\"\nHospitals are on the hook as well. They often contract out-of-network doctors, especially for emergency care providers like surgeons, anesthesiologists and radiologists who are needed around the clock. Plus, hospitals are not required to track providers' insurance networks.\nBut they know doctors are charging out-of-network, said Jha.\n\"Hospitals have an obligation to make sure that every doctor who works within their walls is generating bills that either are part of the insurance that patients have or are things that patients can afford,\" Jha said.\nIn Briggs's case, Swedish Medical Center, the hospital where she was treated, said the vast majority of its physicians practice independently, which is true of most hospitals in Colorado and many others across the country.\nSwedish Medical Center said in a statement that it cannot compel these independent doctors to accept the same insurance plans that the hospital does. \"We strongly encourage those independent physicians to participate in the same insurance networks as we do; however, ultimately those negotiations occur between the individual providers and insurers, not hospitals.\"\nMcGuire, the surgeon who performed Briggs' appendectomy, said he's in-network for more than three quarters of his patients and that his billing company works to help patients secure payment and appeal denials from their insurance companies.\n\"When an insured patient's bill winds up in the legal system, which only happens one tenth of one percent of the time, that insurance company has put the patient in an impossible position, often by refusing to acknowledge that the surgery was emergency care,\" he said. \"The insurance companies hold the power to resolve these issues, and for whatever reason, they choose not to.\"\nAfter Briggs told her story on KUSA last November, McGuire instructed his billing company to change its collection practices, stopping all future legal proceedings against insured patients who received care that their insurance company did not cover.\nBriggs' insurance case worker, who dealt with her billing issues on behalf of the insurance company after Briggs received the surprise bill, declined to comment.\nA shared responsibility\nThe issue goes beyond one patient receiving a surprise bill from one doctor at one hospital in Denver. Colorado legislators are already working to stop physicians from billing patients who receive care at in-network hospitals that accept their insurance plans.\nA lawyer for the state association of collection agencies said in a statement that the trade group and Credit Systems, Inc., the collection firm that pursued payment from Briggs, both \"[support] changes in the law now pending in the Colorado General Assembly that would address the issue of these billings.\"\n\"These cases are challenging for those tasked with collecting the claims as well,\" said the statement.\nKatherine Mulready, chief strategy officer of the Colorado Hospital Association, recognizes that there are many faults in the system and that hospitals have a shared responsibility to do something about these surprise bills \u2014 like telling patients they might be treated by an out-of-network doctor.\n\"That is absolutely an obligation we are willing to make as hospitals,\" Mulready said, but it is not the only issue.\n\"There is a mutual dependence between hospitals and physicians, and not all physicians, but certain types of physicians,\" Mulready said. \"We don't always have the ability to tell physicians how they should run their businesses at the end of the day.\"\nOn the national level, there is agreement from all parties involved, including the American Hospital Association and the lead insurance industry trade group, America's Health Insurance Plans, on the need for a federal fix.\nAnd there's widespread bipartisan support to do just that. Three bills are currently circulating in Congress, all aiming to put an end to surprise medical billing through different approaches.\nA draft bill in the works would ban balance billing, when a patient is expected to pay the difference between what the doctor charged and what the insurance paid. It calls for the state to set a fixed rate for services provided by doctors.\nOne bill introduced into the Senate last year calls for limitations on cost-sharing for out-of-network services. That's the share of costs covered by insurance that patients pay out of pocket.\nAnother bill introduced into the House of Representatives in 2017 would require hospitals to notify patients, at least 24 hours in advance, if the hospital and/or any doctor providing care is not in their insurance network. Hospitals would also have to disclose to patients how much they could expect to pay out-of-pocket.\nUntil federal legislation is passed, patients are left to stick up for themselves and be their own healthcare advocates. Health policy experts say the best thing a patient can do before receiving care \u2014 whether for a planned procedure or in an emergency if possible \u2014 is call the insurance company and make sure that the hospital and the doctor are both in-network.\nFor patients like Briggs, that might not have been enough. Three years later, she's still paying her bill.\n\"I hopefully can bounce back in the next year or so,\" Briggs said, \"but I'll never forget how horrible this was. I'll never forget how many times I cried to my husband, to my mom, to everybody about how frustrating and how illogical this system is.\"\nShe's even testified in the state legislature, arguing to make it illegal for collection agencies to garnish wages for unpaid medical debt, which she says crippled her life.\n\"They all made money off of me,\" Briggs said. \"They made money off of me during one of the worst days of my life.\"",

Police said she also later hit him in the presence of officers.\nThe suspect told police that the man shouldn\u2019t be allowed in a Mexican restaurant wearing the hat, according to the report.\nThe police report also says that the suspect appeared intoxicated and that she hit the victim \"over the head\" as she was being escorted out of the restaurant by officers.\nShe was charged with assault and battery and disorderly conduct and has pleaded not guilty, NBC Boston reported.\nBryton Turner, who said he was the person harassed and who recorded and posted video of the incident, said in a message to NBC News this week that \"she started harassing me verbally\" as soon as he walked in to the restaurant.\n\"All I said was 'I can wear this hat where ever I want this is America,'\" he said in the message. He said he only videotaped the incident \"so she would stop\" and that \"I didn't think it would blow up like this.\"\nAn immigration attorney reported to be representing Santos, Katarina Kozakova, did not immediately return a call on Wednesday.

                "text": "Cathedrals often took more than a century to build in medieval times, a process that sometimes spanned the lives of several monarchs.\nSo French President Emmanuel Macron's pledge Tuesday to restore the fire-devastated Notre Dame within five years was at odds with experts who predicted that restoring the jewel of Gothic architecture would most likely take much longer.\nA host of specialized artisans and skilled workmen will need to be gathered from around France, and likely beyond. These include master stone-cutters, mortar makers, carpenters, roofers, quarrymen and sculptors.\nApril 17, 201902:02\nSpeaking before Macron's announcement, Emily Guerry, a professor of medieval history at England's University of Kent, anticipated restoration work on the 850-year-old icon would take around two decades.\n\u201cThis will be the largest, most important cultural renovation project in France for some time to come,\u201d she said, adding that the process would be \u201cvery delicate.\u201d\nJean-Claude Bellanger, secretary-general of Les Compagnons du Devoir, an organization that provides training in manual trades, told Le Parisian newspaper that the niche nature of the work would require an influx of new talent.\n\u201cWe need to open some 100 places in our carpentry, stone-cutting and roofing sections,\u201d he said, with at least 300 more skilled tradesmen also needing training.\nA decade is necessary to train some of the specialized workers required for such a project, Bellanger added.\nBertrand de Feydeau, vice president of preservation group Fondation du Patrimoine, told France Info radio that the 800-year-old roof that went up in flames was built with wood from forests that have all but disappeared.\nIt won't be rebuilt precisely as it was before because \"we don\u2019t, at the moment, have trees on our territory of the size that were cut in the 13th century,\" he told The Associated Press.\nBut before any work could even start, the building has to be made safe, according to Fondation du Patrimoine.\n\"There is still a risk of collapse of any part of the church, so the priority goes to the 'securitization' of the area to make sure that experts can go safely into the church,\" said Julien Guinhut, the head of communication and fundraising at the organization. \"We are deeply concerned that we could have structural issues.\"\nMacron's promise was aimed at galvanizing a nation reeling after a blaze tore through the 12th-century landmark.\nAnd with around $1 billion raised in donations for Notre Dames's reconstruction, Macron appeared confident it could be made whole again in time for the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics.\n\"We have so much to reconstruct,\" he said. \"So yes, we will rebuild the Cathedral of Notre Dame more beautifully. And I would like it to be achieved in five years from now. We can do it. And we will mobilize.\"\nBut the timescale of similar projects suggests Macron might be focusing on optimism over realism.\nThe Gothic cathedral in Cologne, Germany, was badly damaged during World War II and work to repair it is still going on more than 70 years later.\n\"This is certainly a tragedy with a European dimension, because the Gothic style was invented in France,\u201d Peter Fuessenich, who is leading the reconstruction in Cologne, told the AP. \"It will certainly take years, perhaps even decades, until the last damage caused by this terrible fire will be completely repaired.\u201d\nPierluigi Pericolo, who is in charge of restoration and security at the St. Donatian basilica in the French city of Nantes, said it could take two to five years just to secure and stabilize Notre Dame, given its size.\n\"It's a fundamental step, and very complex, because it's difficult to send workers into a monument whose vaulted ceilings are swollen with water,\" he said on France Info. \"The end of the fire doesn't mean the edifice is totally saved. The stone can deteriorate when it is exposed to high temperatures and change its mineral composition and fracture inside.\"\nApril 16, 201903:12\nHistorians and experts in medieval architecture tried to assuage worries around the world about the future of Notre Dame, saying that such disasters were natural in the lifespan of such buildings.\nSara Uckelman, a professor at Britain\u2019s Durham University, pointed out that the cathedral has endured sieges and two world wars.\n\u201cI'm finding that my background and training as a medievalist means I'm, overall, finding it a lot less devastating than many people,\u201d she wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cI know how churches live. They are not static monuments to the past. They are built, they get burned, they are rebuilt, they are extended, they get ransacked, they get rebuilt, they collapse because they were not built well, they get rebuilt, they get extended, they get renovated, they get bombed, they get rebuilt.\"\nUckelman added, \u201cIt is the continuous presence, not the original structure, that matters.\"",

And we&rsquo;ve developed something very special with respect to that.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kim said during his opening remarks in Hanoi that skeptics of the relationship would be watching closely and see the two leaders &quot;side by side as if they're watching a fancy movie.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kim and Trump had a one-on-one session in the morning, followed by a meeting with a larger group of officials from both sides. But everything fell apart around the lunch hour.</p>\n<p>The two leaders had a number of other issues to discuss, including a possible declaration of the end of the nearly 70-year-old Korean War, the eventual removal of U.S. forces from the Korean Peninsula, and the lifting of the crippling American and international economic sanctions designed to force Pyongyang to give up its weapons programs.</p>\n<p>But it is the <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/how-verify-north-korea-s-nuclear-weapons-heart-trump-kim-n975576\">full, verifiable disarmament of North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear program</a> that the American side ultimately wants.</p>\n<p>Before the summit's unexpected ending, Kim was asked whether he was confident he could strike a deal with Trump.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's too early to say,&quot; Kim replied. &quot;I would not say I'm pessimistic.&quot;</p>\n<p>Trump said he was willing to take his time &mdash; a necessity, it appears, if he is going to eventually persuade Kim to disarm.</p>\n<p>&quot;Chairman Kim and myself, we want to do the right deal,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Speed is not important.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>F.

I\u2019m still optimistic.\"\nThe president also touched on Michael Cohen's scathing congressional testimony Wednesday, saying that his former personal lawyer and fixer hadn't lied about everything.\nFeb. 27, 201901:36\nEarlier, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement confirming that no agreement had been reached, but the \"respective teams look forward to meeting in the future.\"\nWhile Trump has said he was not in a hurry to make a comprehensive pact with Kim, the president touted a \"very strong partnership\" with the North Korean leader before departing Vietnam for Washington empty-handed.\nThe president also said that Kim had pledged that \"testing will not start\u201d of rockets or missiles \u201cor anything having to do with nuclear.\u201d\nThe apparent breakdown in talks is sure to come as a relief to many North Korea experts \u2014 including some Democratic and Republican lawmakers \u2014 who worried Trump was ready to make concessions to Kim without securing a firm and verifiable disarmament commitment from the dictator.\nEarlier Thursday, NBC News first reported that U.S. officials entered the summit having dropped their demand that Kim give a full accounting of his nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles program.\nIn rare remarks to Western reporters before the summit was abbreviated, Kim, who spoke through an interpreter, said that he was willing to consider \"denuclearizing.\"\n\"If I\u2019m not willing to do that, I wouldn\u2019t be here right now,\" Kim said as he sat across the negotiating table from Trump.\nBut the term has had ambiguous meaning in U.S. talks with North Korea.\nTrump himself emphasized repeatedly Thursday that he was in \"no rush\" to get a comprehensive agreement with Kim, playing down expectations for a full nuclear disarmament pact.\nTrump praised Kim for discontinuing missile launches after their first summit in Singapore last year. \"We don\u2019t want the testing. And we\u2019ve developed something very special with respect to that.\"\nKim said during his opening remarks in Hanoi that skeptics of the relationship would be watching closely and see the two leaders \"side by side as if they're watching a fancy movie.\"\nKim and Trump had a one-on-one session in the morning, followed by a meeting with a larger group of officials from both sides. But everything fell apart around the lunch hour.\nThe two leaders had a number of other issues to discuss, including a possible declaration of the end of the nearly 70-year-old Korean War, the eventual removal of U.S. forces from the Korean Peninsula, and the lifting of the crippling American and international economic sanctions designed to force Pyongyang to give up its weapons programs.\nBut it is the full, verifiable disarmament of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program that the American side ultimately wants.\nBefore the summit's unexpected ending, Kim was asked whether he was confident he could strike a deal with Trump.\n\"It's too early to say,\" Kim replied. \"I would not say I'm pessimistic.\"\nTrump said he was willing to take his time \u2014 a necessity, it appears, if he is going to eventually persuade Kim to disarm.\n\"Chairman Kim and myself, we want to do the right deal,\" Trump said. \"Speed is not important.\"\nF. Brinley Bruton and Jason Cumming reported from London.",

He said Trump provided inflated financial statements to get a bank loan, lied to reduce his tax bills and concocted a fake auction in which his foundation purchased a portrait of him.</p>\n<p>&quot;To your knowledge, did the president ever provide inflated assets to an insurance company?&quot; asked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a freshman Democrat from New York.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Cohen responded.</p>\n<p>Repeatedly, when asked who might be able to corroborate these allegations, Cohen mentioned two key figures in the Trump Organization: Allen Weisselberg, Trump's longtime accountant, and Alan Garten, executive vice president and chief legal officer.</p>\n<p>Weisselberg was given limited immunity to testify about his role in the hush money payments, but he is not cooperating, three people with knowledge of the situation told NBC News. Garten's status is unclear.</p>\n<p>&quot;Sitting here today, it seems unbelievable that I was so mesmerized by Donald Trump that I was willing to do things for him that I knew were absolutely wrong,&quot; Cohen told the lawmakers.</p>\n<p>&quot;I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people here today.&quot;</p>",

Elijah Cummings, D-Md., answered, \"It appears that he did.\"\nIn another exchange with Krishnamoorthi, Cohen suggested that New York prosecutors had an interest in his conversations with the president or his top people.\nCohen said the last time he spoke to the president or his representative was \"within two months\" of the April 2018 FBI raid on Cohen's home and office.\n\"What did he or his agent communicate to you?\" Krishnamoorthi asked.\n\"Unfortunately, this topic is actually something that's being investigated right now by the Southern District of New York, and I've been asked by them not to discuss and not to talk about these issues,\" Cohen replied.\nThe White House did not respond specifically to Cohen's comments, other than to note that he had pleaded guilty to lying and therefore, should not be trusted.\nNBC News has reported that Cohen met with Southern District prosecutors recently and provided them information regarding their investigations into the Trump Organization and the Trump inaugural committee.\nBut Cohen made allegations that also raised questions of bank, tax, charity and insurance fraud by the Trump Organization, which did not respond to an NBC News request for comment. He said Trump provided inflated financial statements to get a bank loan, lied to reduce his tax bills and concocted a fake auction in which his foundation purchased a portrait of him.\n\"To your knowledge, did the president ever provide inflated assets to an insurance company?\" asked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a freshman Democrat from New York.\n\"Yes,\" Cohen responded.\nRepeatedly, when asked who might be able to corroborate these allegations, Cohen mentioned two key figures in the Trump Organization: Allen Weisselberg, Trump's longtime accountant, and Alan Garten, executive vice president and chief legal officer.\nWeisselberg was given limited immunity to testify about his role in the hush money payments, but he is not cooperating, three people with knowledge of the situation told NBC News. Garten's status is unclear.\n\"Sitting here today, it seems unbelievable that I was so mesmerized by Donald Trump that I was willing to do things for him that I knew were absolutely wrong,\" Cohen told the lawmakers.\n\"I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people here today.\"",

There's still a future for coal, but we need to make sure that we're debating the right people on that issue.\u201d\nComer was answering a question about Barr's decision to take back the invitation he extended to Ocasio-Cortez last month to visit his home state in order to learn how her Green New Deal proposal would affect coal miners and their families.\nDespite his own caution the day before to his GOP colleagues, Comer tweeted Tuesday in response to Ocasio-Cortez's remark, \u201cLol, my constituents know that your Socialist policies like #MedicareForAll and #GreenNewDeal will not work.\u201d\nA representative for Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment to NBC News about the flap.\nBarr had made the invitation to Ocasio-Cortez after the self-described democratic socialist ardently defended her Green New Deal at a congressional hearing against criticisms that the environmental policy goals outlined in the plan represented \"elitist\" concerns.\n\"This is not an elitist issue,\" Ocasio-Cortez said at the hearing after mentioning her working-class background. \"This is a quality-of-life issue. You want to tell people that their concern for clean air and clean water is elitist? Tell that to that kids in the South Bronx, which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country. Tell that to the families in Flint, whose kids have their blood, is ascending in lead levels. Their brains are damaged for the rest of their lives. Call them elitist.\"\nOcasio-Cortez told the congressman she would be \"happy\" to make the visit, noting that her proposal would include funding coal miners' pensions with the aim of ensuring \"a just transition\" and investment in jobs.\nBut Barr rescinded his invitation last week after Ocasio-Cortez got into Twitter tangle with Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, for his criticism of their fellow freshman Illhan Omar's remarks on a completely separate issue \u2014 the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\nCrenshaw and others, including conservative media, blasted Omar, D-Minn, for comments she made at an event last month in which she used vague phrasing that some saw as minimizing the 9/11 attacks.\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group, was founded \"because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,\u201d Omar said.\nCrenshaw tweeted in response: \u201cFirst member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as 'some people who did something.' Unbelievable.\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez then responded to Crenshaw, an Afghanistan War veteran and former Navy SEAL, calling him a hypocrite.\n\u201cIn 2018, right-wing extremists were behind almost all U.S. domestic terrorist killings,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"Why don\u2019t you go do something about that?\"\nThat prompted Barr to demand an apology \u2014 and suspend his invitation.\n\"I urge you to apologize to our colleague prior to coming to visit Kentucky,\" Barr said in a letter Friday posted on Twitter, adding that her comments \u201cdemonstrate a lack of civility\u201d toward Crenshaw.\nOcasio-Cortez's spokesman, Corbin Trent, suggested in a statement to The Courier-Journal last week that the congresswoman could always visit the state on her own.\n\"Luckily, Kentucky has open borders,\" he said.",

The bill also had five Republican co-sponsors, led by New York Rep. Peter King, who had tried &mdash; and failed &mdash; for several years to advance the bill while his party controlled the chamber.</p>\n<p>Democrats taking control of the House has &ldquo;really given it momentum.

It&rsquo;s a loophole that allowed Dylann Roof to obtain his weapon with which he murdered nine people at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Had the FBI background check been completed, he would have been blocked because it would have been revealed that he had previously admitted to drug possession.</p>\n<p>The effort to close that loophole is the first test of the new Democratic leadership&rsquo;s ability to advance a few modest legislative goals capable of garnering bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress, aides say.</p>\n<p>In the Senate, Democrats are hoping to pressure Republicans, including Tim Scott of South Carolina and Cory Gardner of Colorado &mdash; another state rocked by mass shootings &mdash; to align themselves with the measure and lean on McConnell to bring it for a vote.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump has vowed to veto the current legislation, and many advocates remain skeptical that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will bring it up for a vote.</p>\n<p>The two bills represent the first gun safety efforts expected to pass the House since the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1994 mandated federal background checks on firearm purchases in the United States.</p>\n<p>Much has changed in the world of gun sales since then &mdash; the law doesn&rsquo;t cover sales over the internet and at gun shows, meaning there are gaping holes in the nation&rsquo;s legal gun purchasing system.</p>\n<p>While the current divided Congress makes it unlikely that any significant gun safety efforts will pass anytime soon, advocates say it&rsquo;s an effort worth making.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At least one body of Congress is willing to do what many Americans are asking for &hellip; and then build towards bold policies that we really need to reduce gun deaths,&rdquo; said Igor Volsky, executive director of Guns Down America, a grassroots advocacy group that says it is &ldquo;taking on&rdquo; the NRA.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/stephanie-ruhle/watch/house-set-to-vote-this-week-on-gun-reform-bills-1448498755537\"><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1240px)\" srcset=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201902/n_ruhle_mpp_190226_1920x1080.focal-860x484.jpg\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 758px)\" srcset=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201902/n_ruhle_mpp_190226_1920x1080.focal-1000x563.jpg\"></source><img src=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201902/n_ruhle_mpp_190226_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg\"></img></picture></a></figure>\n<p>Feb. 26, 201905:25</p>\n<p>The 2018 midterm election marked a turning point of sorts, with pro-gun control groups increasing their political muscle.</p>\n<p>For the first time, groups like Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords PAC, founded by former Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords -- who was shot and seriously wounded by a would-be assassin in 2011 -- spent at least $13 million at the state and federal levels in the midterms.</p>\n<p>That figure is $2 million more than gun rights groups including the N.R.A. spent, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p>\n<p>Television ads run by Everytown for Gun Safety highlighting the need for tougher gun laws increased 22 fold from four years ago, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. In tossup House races, 93 percent of gun-related ads favored stricter gun measures, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/shootings-thrust-gun-control-into-midterm-campaign-ads-1537263001?mod=hp_featst_pos1\">the Journal analysis found</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of the candidates who ran openly on a platform to curb gun violence won, even in traditionally Republican areas like Texas. For instance, of the 307 federal and local candidates Giffords <a href=\"https://giffords.org/endorsements/\">endorsed</a>, 256 were victorious. They also include new members such as Lucy McBath of Georgia, who lost her son, Jordan Davis, in 2012.</p>\n<p>Activists say that wider public support for broadening background checks, with 90 percent approval in Gallup and other major polls, along with the coming of age of a generation of children born into a culture of school shootings that began with the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, has shifted the activism intensity to the side of gun control.</p>\n<p>Sam Zeif, 19, lost a friend in the mass shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last year. Zeif said that following the shooting, the school&rsquo;s students and parents created new gun safety groups, including March for our Lives and Change the Ref. They have held town halls, arranged demonstrations, called congressional offices and arranged petitions while coordinating with parents from Columbine and Sandy Hook in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children as young as six lost their lives in a mass shooting in 2012.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be the same without everyone&rsquo;s contribution,&rdquo; Zeif said. &ldquo;Somebody had to do it. It just happened to be us,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Sponsors of the legislation being voted on Wednesday also credited activism by the Parkland students as a critical factor in building momentum. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the accumulation of tragedies over the years, personified by Parkland,&rdquo; King said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Every day, there&rsquo;s a group of young people up here campaigning for expansion of background checks,&rdquo; Rep. Mike Thompson, a California Democrat who is co-sponsoring the broad background check bill, added.</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 On Wednesday, for the first time in a generation, the U.S. House passed new gun control legislation, by a vote of 240-190.\nThe legislation \u2014 and another bill scheduled for a vote \u2014 reflects a confluence of events, including a newly empowered House Democratic majority, the apparently diminishing clout of the National Rifle Association, and the activism of a generation of young Americans following years of deadly school shootings.\nThe House bill would require background checks on all commercial gun sales, including those at gun shows and over the internet. The bill also had five Republican co-sponsors, led by New York Rep. Peter King, who had tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 for several years to advance the bill while his party controlled the chamber.\nDemocrats taking control of the House has \u201creally given it momentum. Hate to admit that, but that\u2019s the reality,\u201d King said in an interview with NBC News.\nFeb. 26, 201901:20\nBut other Republicans contend the legislation would have no impact in preventing some mass shootings and that it will ultimately threaten the rights of legal gun owners.\nIf the two bills became law, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, said at a news conference Tuesday, there would be \"a situation where they couldn\u2019t be enforced, ultimately, without a federal gun registry.\"\nRep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the Republican minority whip who was shot and gravely injured at a congressional baseball practice in 2017 added: \u201cIt\u2019s one more step towards federalized gun registration and ultimately gun confiscation.\u201d\nKing said that argument \u201cjust isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the person who is a criminal, the person who has a history of mental illness,\u201d he said, noting his party is out of step even with most gun owners.\nSince the bill faces an uphill fight in the Republican-run Senate, the House leadership has arranged for a separate vote Thursday on a more modest measure that may be able to attract greater bipartisan support.\nThat bill would close the so-called \u201cCharleston loophole,\u201d which allows the sale of a firearm to proceed if a background check is not completed within three days. It\u2019s a loophole that allowed Dylann Roof to obtain his weapon with which he murdered nine people at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Had the FBI background check been completed, he would have been blocked because it would have been revealed that he had previously admitted to drug possession.\nThe effort to close that loophole is the first test of the new Democratic leadership\u2019s ability to advance a few modest legislative goals capable of garnering bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress, aides say.\nIn the Senate, Democrats are hoping to pressure Republicans, including Tim Scott of South Carolina and Cory Gardner of Colorado \u2014 another state rocked by mass shootings \u2014 to align themselves with the measure and lean on McConnell to bring it for a vote.\nPresident Donald Trump has vowed to veto the current legislation, and many advocates remain skeptical that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will bring it up for a vote.\nThe two bills represent the first gun safety efforts expected to pass the House since the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1994 mandated federal background checks on firearm purchases in the United States.\nMuch has changed in the world of gun sales since then \u2014 the law doesn\u2019t cover sales over the internet and at gun shows, meaning there are gaping holes in the nation\u2019s legal gun purchasing system.\nWhile the current divided Congress makes it unlikely that any significant gun safety efforts will pass anytime soon, advocates say it\u2019s an effort worth making.\n\u201cAt least one body of Congress is willing to do what many Americans are asking for \u2026 and then build towards bold policies that we really need to reduce gun deaths,\u201d said Igor Volsky, executive director of Guns Down America, a grassroots advocacy group that says it is \u201ctaking on\u201d the NRA.\nFeb. 26, 201905:25\nThe 2018 midterm election marked a turning point of sorts, with pro-gun control groups increasing their political muscle.\nFor the first time, groups like Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords PAC, founded by former Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords -- who was shot and seriously wounded by a would-be assassin in 2011 -- spent at least $13 million at the state and federal levels in the midterms.\nThat figure is $2 million more than gun rights groups including the N.R.A. spent, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nTelevision ads run by Everytown for Gun Safety highlighting the need for tougher gun laws increased 22 fold from four years ago, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. In tossup House races, 93 percent of gun-related ads favored stricter gun measures, the Journal analysis found.\nMany of the candidates who ran openly on a platform to curb gun violence won, even in traditionally Republican areas like Texas. For instance, of the 307 federal and local candidates Giffords endorsed, 256 were victorious. They also include new members such as Lucy McBath of Georgia, who lost her son, Jordan Davis, in 2012.\nActivists say that wider public support for broadening background checks, with 90 percent approval in Gallup and other major polls, along with the coming of age of a generation of children born into a culture of school shootings that began with the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, has shifted the activism intensity to the side of gun control.\nSam Zeif, 19, lost a friend in the mass shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last year. Zeif said that following the shooting, the school\u2019s students and parents created new gun safety groups, including March for our Lives and Change the Ref. They have held town halls, arranged demonstrations, called congressional offices and arranged petitions while coordinating with parents from Columbine and Sandy Hook in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children as young as six lost their lives in a mass shooting in 2012.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same without everyone\u2019s contribution,\u201d Zeif said. \u201cSomebody had to do it. It just happened to be us,\u201d he said.\nSponsors of the legislation being voted on Wednesday also credited activism by the Parkland students as a critical factor in building momentum. \u201cIt\u2019s the accumulation of tragedies over the years, personified by Parkland,\u201d King said.\n\u201cEvery day, there\u2019s a group of young people up here campaigning for expansion of background checks,\u201d Rep. Mike Thompson, a California Democrat who is co-sponsoring the broad background check bill, added.",

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., then ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, leaves a secure area where the panel meets at the Capitol, on Feb. 5, 2018J. Scott Applewhite / AP</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Whether Mueller will answer that question in the absence of criminal charges is unclear. But in an interview with NBC News, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said he is steering his investigation in a new direction to focus on it &mdash; and he will demand any relevant evidence compiled by the FBI or Mueller's team.</p>\n<p>The California Democrat also expressed concern that Mueller hasn't fully investigated Trump's possible financial history with Russia.</p>\n<p>&quot;From what we can see either publicly or otherwise, it's very much an open question whether this is something the special counsel has looked at,&quot; Schiff told NBC News.</p>\n<p>Schiff said the public testimony from former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen that in 2016 Trump stood to earn hundreds of millions of dollars from a secret Moscow real estate project is a staggering conflict of interest that must be fully explored.</p>\n<p>&quot;I certainly agree that the counterintelligence investigation may be more important than the criminal investigation because it goes to a present threat to our national security &mdash; whether the president and anybody around him are compromised by a foreign power,&quot; Schiff said. &quot;That's not necessarily an issue that can be covered in indictments.&quot;</p>\n<p>In fact, most FBI counterintelligence investigations don't result in criminal charges, experts say, because they tend to involve secret intelligence that either can't be used in court or doesn't add up to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If the FBI assesses that a government official is compromised by a foreign adversary, officials often will quietly remove that person from a sensitive role or wall him or her off from classified information.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/schiff-growing-evidence-of-trump-obstruction-of-justice-1457734723832\"><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1240px)\" srcset=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201903/n_lw_aschiff_190313_1920x1080.focal-860x484.jpg\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 758px)\" srcset=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201903/n_lw_aschiff_190313_1920x1080.focal-1000x563.jpg\"></source><img src=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201903/n_lw_aschiff_190313_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg\"></img></picture></a></figure>\n<p>March 13, 201917:01</p>\n<p>Obviously, none of that is an option for the president of the United States.</p>\n<p>No official action was taken after Trump was accused of giving highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister in the Oval Office in 2017. As the president, he has the legal right to spill secrets to whomever he wants.</p>\n<p>The White House has long insisted that the notion of a president in thrall to the Kremlin is ridiculous, pointing to the sanctions the Trump administration has levied on Russia in response to cyber attacks, election interference, and its actions in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Trump defenders complain that those who are now focusing on foreign influence have &quot;moved the goalposts&quot; &mdash; shifting emphasis to the issue of foreign compromise now that criminal charges involving &quot;Russian collusion&quot; seem less likely.</p>\n<p>Trump has criticized Schiff&rsquo;s approach, saying in a Feb. 7 tweet, &quot;So now Congressman Adam Schiff announces, after having found zero Russian Collusion, that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so. Never happened before! Unlimited Presidential Harassment.&quot;</p>\n<p>But the question of Trump's motives regarding Russia has always been front and center for the FBI, as former Acting Director Andrew McCabe made clear in a recent round of media appearances. Neither Trump nor any of his supporters has been able to quell questions about the president's embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, including Trump's seeming unwillingness to criticize the Russian autocrat.</p>\n<figure><figcaption>Robert Mueller, then director of the FBI, testifies on Capitol Hill in 2011.Brendan Hoffman / Getty Images file</figcaption></figure>\n<p>McCabe, who was fired for lack of candor in an unrelated matter, alleged that the president disputed intelligence that a North Korean missile could hit the United States, saying, &quot;I don't care.

I don't see any reason why it would be.&quot;</p>\n<p>McCabe said he could not rule out that the president was, in essence, a Russian asset. Trump has called McCabe a liar and &quot;a disgrace to the FBI.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What Americans should be concerned about is whether the president's Russia policy is not dictated by our national interest but is dictated by his desire to make hundreds of millions of dollars off a tower in Moscow,&quot; Schiff said.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/schiff-real-question-if-trump-under-influence-foreign-power-n984911\">In the beginning, a counterspy probe</a></h3>\n<p>The FBI's Russia investigation began in July 2016 as a counterintelligence investigation into Trump campaign aides. Current and former officials say the case involved agents whose expertise is counterspy cases and agents who worked criminal matters.</p>\n<p>After Mueller took over the investigation and began filing criminal charges, the public and the news media came to view the probe largely through the lens of the criminal justice system. But the counterintelligence dimension never diminished.</p>\n<p>The FBI was looking for crimes, but was also using intelligence tools to ferret out and thwart Russia's efforts to interfere in American democracy. And it was collecting intelligence that the government would likely never want to use in court, current and former officials tell NBC News.</p>\n<p>In May 2017, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, told NBC News anchor Lester Holt he did so with Russia on his mind, and told the Russian foreign minister the firing had relieved &quot;great pressure&quot; on him. That led the FBI to open a counterintelligence investigation into the president specifically, according to McCabe. It was married to a criminal investigation examining possible conspiracy with Russian election interference and possible obstruction of justice, McCabe said.</p>\n<p>After Mueller in July 2018 accused Russian intelligence officers who hacked the Democrats of conspiring against the United States, many expected that he eventually might charge members of the Trump campaign with participating in that conspiracy.</p>\n<p>That hasn't happened. To the contrary, some of the key figures seen as likely participants in any Russia conspiracy &mdash; Mike Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Michael Cohen &mdash; have been charged with other offenses in cases that made no allegation of any &quot;collusion&quot; with Russia. Two of them, Manafort and Cohen, have been sentenced.</p>\n<p>But just because they haven't been charged criminally doesn't mean there isn't evidence they were influenced by Russia, said Frank Figliuzzi, the former top counterintelligence official at the FBI and an NBC News contributor.</p>\n<p>&quot;I cringe when I see people trying to apply criminal metrics to a counterintelligence case,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>More often than not in counterintelligence cases, Figliuzzi said, the FBI makes a determination that a person has been subject to foreign influence without pursuing criminal charges. For example, he said, if the bureau finds that a top general has developed an inappropriate relationship with a Chinese intelligence asset, that general likely wouldn't be charged with espionage or other crimes. But he almost certainly would be fired.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/preet-bharara-tempers-expectations-on-mueller-probe-1460813379678\"><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1240px)\" srcset=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201903/n_mj_preet1_190319_1920x1080.focal-860x484.jpg\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 758px)\" srcset=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201903/n_mj_preet1_190319_1920x1080.focal-1000x563.jpg\"></source><img src=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201903/n_mj_preet1_190319_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg\"></img></picture></a></figure>\n<p>March 19, 201909:13</p>\n<p>In Trump's case, longtime students of his real estate career have raised questions about how he generated large amounts of cash in recent years to make big purchases of golf courses and other assets, and of why the German bank Deutsche Bank &mdash; which has been fined for laundering Russian money &mdash; made loans to him when, by all accounts, no other bank would. There is no public evidence linking Trump&rsquo;s relationship to Deutsche Bank with the allegations of laundering money for wealthy Russians.</p>\n<p>According to the Washington Post, the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section is investigating how Saudi Arabia and other countries sought to influence the Trump Administration through relationships with a key fundraiser, Elliott Broidy. Through a spokesman, Broidy has not denied working with those countries, but he denies any wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>It has long been presumed that Mueller would investigate these questions, to determine the extent of Trump's financial history with Russia or other foreign entities that now have a stake in his policy decisions. Trump is the only president in recent history not to have released his tax returns, and the only one to retain a stake in a business empire.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/schiff-real-question-if-trump-under-influence-foreign-power-n984911\">How far did Mueller go?</a></h3>\n<p>But Schiff told NBC News he is not convinced that Mueller's Russia investigation &mdash; tasked with examining whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian election interference &mdash; delved deeply into Trump's personal finances.</p>\n<p>&quot;The concern I've had in terms of the scope of the Mueller investigation is that the president has tried to draw a red line around certain aspects of his finances,&quot; Schiff said. &quot;That's not a line that can be observed and still protect the country.&quot;</p>\n<p>The special counsel&rsquo;s office declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Schiff noted that the New York Times reported that Trump demanded that Mueller be fired in December 2017 after news reports suggested the special counsel had sent a subpoena to Deutsche Bank. After Trump's lawyers were assured by Mueller's office that the reports were not accurate, the president backed down, according to the Times. The president has called reports he sought to fire Mueller &quot;fake news.&quot;</p>\n<p>But if Mueller hasn't looked at Trump's relationship the German bank, Schiff said, &quot;they have not done a diligent investigation of money laundering.&quot;</p>\n<p>He added: &quot;If the president has been successful in chilling the DOJ from looking at his finances, then the Congress needs to do it&hellip; Any way in which this president or those around him might be compromised by a foreign hostile power is front and center in our probe.&quot;</p>\n<p>David Kris, a former Justice Department national security lawyer and founder of Culper Partners consulting firm, worked closely with Mueller when he was FBI director, and knows him well. He told NBC News he believes that Mueller would have taken whatever steps necessary to examine the question of whether Trump had an improper financial relationship with Russia or Russian oligarchs.</p>\n<p>&quot;I would trust Mueller to be competently thorough,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>It's possible, however, that Mueller didn't believe his mandate allowed him to rummage through Trump's financial history, he added.</p>\n<p>Either way, Kris said, Schiff and Congress are on solid legal footing in expecting that Mueller and the FBI will brief them on the results of the counterintelligence investigation into the president &mdash; regardless of what criminal charges Mueller files or what he puts in his report.</p>\n<p>Leaving aside the special counsel regulations, the executive branch is required by law to keep the House and Senate intelligence committees &quot;fully and currently informed&quot; on important intelligence matters, Kris noted. There is also a requirement that the Justice Department tell Congress about any instances in which a prosecution was halted over concerns about intelligence sources and methods.</p>\n<p>Figliuzzi said he frequently briefed Congress on major counterintelligence cases as FBI counterspy chief. He said it's essential that Mueller tell the Congress what, if anything, he has found pointing to possible Russian or other foreign influence on anyone in the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is an independent reporting obligation that the intelligence community has,&quot; Schiff said. &quot;I do think that the special counsel regulations certainly permit the sharing of this information with the Congress and we're going to insist on it.&quot;</p>\n<p>Schiff said he is particularly concerned about the Trump Tower Moscow project, the real estate development Cohen was pitching to the Kremlin while Trump was running for president.</p>\n<p>He noted that when it first emerged that Cohen had emailed Putin's office seeking help, Putin's spokesman, Dmitri Pescov, said he never answered the email. But it later emerged in court documents that an assistant to Pescov did respond, emailing Cohen and asking him to call, which he did.</p>\n<p>&quot;So here we had the Kremlin facilitating a cover up by the president of the United States,&quot; Schiff said. &quot;This needs to be exposed.&quot;</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Nearly two years into his investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller has not accused any member of the Trump campaign of conspiring with the 2016 election interference effort \u2014 and it's not clear whether he will.\nBut legal experts, along with the congressman leading the House Russia investigation, tell NBC News that the most important question investigators must answer is one that may never have been suitable for the criminal courts: Whether President Trump or anyone around him is under the influence of a foreign government.\n\"It's more important to know what Trump is NOW than to know what he did in 2016,\" said Martin Lederman, professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel during the Obama administration. \"It's more important to know whether he has been compromised as president than whether his conduct during the campaign constituted a crime.\"\nWhether Mueller will answer that question in the absence of criminal charges is unclear. But in an interview with NBC News, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said he is steering his investigation in a new direction to focus on it \u2014 and he will demand any relevant evidence compiled by the FBI or Mueller's team.\nThe California Democrat also expressed concern that Mueller hasn't fully investigated Trump's possible financial history with Russia.\n\"From what we can see either publicly or otherwise, it's very much an open question whether this is something the special counsel has looked at,\" Schiff told NBC News.\nSchiff said the public testimony from former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen that in 2016 Trump stood to earn hundreds of millions of dollars from a secret Moscow real estate project is a staggering conflict of interest that must be fully explored.\n\"I certainly agree that the counterintelligence investigation may be more important than the criminal investigation because it goes to a present threat to our national security \u2014 whether the president and anybody around him are compromised by a foreign power,\" Schiff said. \"That's not necessarily an issue that can be covered in indictments.\"\nIn fact, most FBI counterintelligence investigations don't result in criminal charges, experts say, because they tend to involve secret intelligence that either can't be used in court or doesn't add up to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If the FBI assesses that a government official is compromised by a foreign adversary, officials often will quietly remove that person from a sensitive role or wall him or her off from classified information.\nMarch 13, 201917:01\nObviously, none of that is an option for the president of the United States.\nNo official action was taken after Trump was accused of giving highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister in the Oval Office in 2017. As the president, he has the legal right to spill secrets to whomever he wants.\nThe White House has long insisted that the notion of a president in thrall to the Kremlin is ridiculous, pointing to the sanctions the Trump administration has levied on Russia in response to cyber attacks, election interference, and its actions in Ukraine.\nTrump defenders complain that those who are now focusing on foreign influence have \"moved the goalposts\" \u2014 shifting emphasis to the issue of foreign compromise now that criminal charges involving \"Russian collusion\" seem less likely.\nTrump has criticized Schiff\u2019s approach, saying in a Feb. 7 tweet, \"So now Congressman Adam Schiff announces, after having found zero Russian Collusion, that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so. Never happened before! Unlimited Presidential Harassment.\"\nBut the question of Trump's motives regarding Russia has always been front and center for the FBI, as former Acting Director Andrew McCabe made clear in a recent round of media appearances. Neither Trump nor any of his supporters has been able to quell questions about the president's embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, including Trump's seeming unwillingness to criticize the Russian autocrat.\nMcCabe, who was fired for lack of candor in an unrelated matter, alleged that the president disputed intelligence that a North Korean missile could hit the United States, saying, \"I don't care. I believe Putin.\"\nThat allegedly happened behind closed doors, but few will forget the public spectacle of Trump siding with Putin over his intelligence community on the question of U.S. election interference at last year's Helsinki summit, telling the world: \"President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be.\"\nMcCabe said he could not rule out that the president was, in essence, a Russian asset. Trump has called McCabe a liar and \"a disgrace to the FBI.\"\n\"What Americans should be concerned about is whether the president's Russia policy is not dictated by our national interest but is dictated by his desire to make hundreds of millions of dollars off a tower in Moscow,\" Schiff said.\nIn the beginning, a counterspy probe\nThe FBI's Russia investigation began in July 2016 as a counterintelligence investigation into Trump campaign aides. Current and former officials say the case involved agents whose expertise is counterspy cases and agents who worked criminal matters.\nAfter Mueller took over the investigation and began filing criminal charges, the public and the news media came to view the probe largely through the lens of the criminal justice system. But the counterintelligence dimension never diminished.\nThe FBI was looking for crimes, but was also using intelligence tools to ferret out and thwart Russia's efforts to interfere in American democracy. And it was collecting intelligence that the government would likely never want to use in court, current and former officials tell NBC News.\nIn May 2017, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, told NBC News anchor Lester Holt he did so with Russia on his mind, and told the Russian foreign minister the firing had relieved \"great pressure\" on him. That led the FBI to open a counterintelligence investigation into the president specifically, according to McCabe. It was married to a criminal investigation examining possible conspiracy with Russian election interference and possible obstruction of justice, McCabe said.\nAfter Mueller in July 2018 accused Russian intelligence officers who hacked the Democrats of conspiring against the United States, many expected that he eventually might charge members of the Trump campaign with participating in that conspiracy.\nThat hasn't happened. To the contrary, some of the key figures seen as likely participants in any Russia conspiracy \u2014 Mike Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Michael Cohen \u2014 have been charged with other offenses in cases that made no allegation of any \"collusion\" with Russia. Two of them, Manafort and Cohen, have been sentenced.\nBut just because they haven't been charged criminally doesn't mean there isn't evidence they were influenced by Russia, said Frank Figliuzzi, the former top counterintelligence official at the FBI and an NBC News contributor.\n\"I cringe when I see people trying to apply criminal metrics to a counterintelligence case,\" he said.\nMore often than not in counterintelligence cases, Figliuzzi said, the FBI makes a determination that a person has been subject to foreign influence without pursuing criminal charges. For example, he said, if the bureau finds that a top general has developed an inappropriate relationship with a Chinese intelligence asset, that general likely wouldn't be charged with espionage or other crimes. But he almost certainly would be fired.\nMarch 19, 201909:13\nIn Trump's case, longtime students of his real estate career have raised questions about how he generated large amounts of cash in recent years to make big purchases of golf courses and other assets, and of why the German bank Deutsche Bank \u2014 which has been fined for laundering Russian money \u2014 made loans to him when, by all accounts, no other bank would. There is no public evidence linking Trump\u2019s relationship to Deutsche Bank with the allegations of laundering money for wealthy Russians.\nAccording to the Washington Post, the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section is investigating how Saudi Arabia and other countries sought to influence the Trump Administration through relationships with a key fundraiser, Elliott Broidy. Through a spokesman, Broidy has not denied working with those countries, but he denies any wrongdoing.\nIt has long been presumed that Mueller would investigate these questions, to determine the extent of Trump's financial history with Russia or other foreign entities that now have a stake in his policy decisions. Trump is the only president in recent history not to have released his tax returns, and the only one to retain a stake in a business empire.\nHow far did Mueller go?\nBut Schiff told NBC News he is not convinced that Mueller's Russia investigation \u2014 tasked with examining whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian election interference \u2014 delved deeply into Trump's personal finances.\n\"The concern I've had in terms of the scope of the Mueller investigation is that the president has tried to draw a red line around certain aspects of his finances,\" Schiff said. \"That's not a line that can be observed and still protect the country.\"\nThe special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment.\nSchiff noted that the New York Times reported that Trump demanded that Mueller be fired in December 2017 after news reports suggested the special counsel had sent a subpoena to Deutsche Bank. After Trump's lawyers were assured by Mueller's office that the reports were not accurate, the president backed down, according to the Times. The president has called reports he sought to fire Mueller \"fake news.\"\nBut if Mueller hasn't looked at Trump's relationship the German bank, Schiff said, \"they have not done a diligent investigation of money laundering.\"\nHe added: \"If the president has been successful in chilling the DOJ from looking at his finances, then the Congress needs to do it\u2026 Any way in which this president or those around him might be compromised by a foreign hostile power is front and center in our probe.\"\nDavid Kris, a former Justice Department national security lawyer and founder of Culper Partners consulting firm, worked closely with Mueller when he was FBI director, and knows him well. He told NBC News he believes that Mueller would have taken whatever steps necessary to examine the question of whether Trump had an improper financial relationship with Russia or Russian oligarchs.\n\"I would trust Mueller to be competently thorough,\" he said.\nIt's possible, however, that Mueller didn't believe his mandate allowed him to rummage through Trump's financial history, he added.\nEither way, Kris said, Schiff and Congress are on solid legal footing in expecting that Mueller and the FBI will brief them on the results of the counterintelligence investigation into the president \u2014 regardless of what criminal charges Mueller files or what he puts in his report.\nLeaving aside the special counsel regulations, the executive branch is required by law to keep the House and Senate intelligence committees \"fully and currently informed\" on important intelligence matters, Kris noted. There is also a requirement that the Justice Department tell Congress about any instances in which a prosecution was halted over concerns about intelligence sources and methods.\nFigliuzzi said he frequently briefed Congress on major counterintelligence cases as FBI counterspy chief. He said it's essential that Mueller tell the Congress what, if anything, he has found pointing to possible Russian or other foreign influence on anyone in the Trump administration.\n\"This is an independent reporting obligation that the intelligence community has,\" Schiff said. \"I do think that the special counsel regulations certainly permit the sharing of this information with the Congress and we're going to insist on it.\"\nSchiff said he is particularly concerned about the Trump Tower Moscow project, the real estate development Cohen was pitching to the Kremlin while Trump was running for president.\nHe noted that when it first emerged that Cohen had emailed Putin's office seeking help, Putin's spokesman, Dmitri Pescov, said he never answered the email. But it later emerged in court documents that an assistant to Pescov did respond, emailing Cohen and asking him to call, which he did.\n\"So here we had the Kremlin facilitating a cover up by the president of the United States,\" Schiff said. \"This needs to be exposed.\"",

I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way,&rdquo; said Cohen in a 20-page opening statement. &ldquo;I am not protecting Mr. Trump anymore.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/michael-cohen-brands-trump-as-a-racist-in-opening-statement-1449149507681\"><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1240px)\" srcset=\"https://media13.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201902/2019-02-27T155937Z_304812300_RC155B4B3570_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-RUSSIA-COHEN.focal-860x484.JPG\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 758px)\" srcset=\"https://media13.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201902/2019-02-27T155937Z_304812300_RC155B4B3570_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-RUSSIA-COHEN.focal-1000x563.JPG\"></source><img src=\"https://media13.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201902/2019-02-27T155937Z_304812300_RC155B4B3570_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-RUSSIA-COHEN.focal-760x428.JPG\"></img></picture></a></figure>\n<p>In his closing remarks, Cohen addressed the president head-on, occasionally looking straight into the cameras while ticking off items on a lengthy list of criticism of Trump's behavior in office, ranging from his weather-based decision to skip a ceremony honoring veterans to his attacks on law enforcement, the media and others.</p>\n<p>&quot;You don&rsquo;t use your power of your bully pulpit to destroy the credibility of those who speak out against you. You don&rsquo;t separate families from one another or demonize those looking to America for a better life. You don&rsquo;t vilify people based on the god they pray to, and you don&rsquo;t cuddle up to our adversaries at the expense of our allies,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>&quot;And finally, you don&rsquo;t shut down the government before Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s just to simply appease your base. This behavior is churlish, it denigrates the office of the president and it&rsquo;s un-American and it&rsquo;s not you.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen is due to report to prison in early May for a three-year sentence for a series of charges he pleaded guilty to last year, including <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/ex-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-discussing-plea-deal-prosecutors-n902571\">eight felony counts</a> of tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations, as well as one count of making a false statement to Congress. On the eve of his testimony, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/michael-cohen-has-been-disbarred-n976436\">a New York state court filing revealed</a> that he had been disbarred.</p>\n<p>Democrats, who now control the committee, asked Cohen questions Wednesday about alleged criminal conduct by Trump while Republican members on the committee largely sought to discredit and delegitimize Cohen&rsquo;s testimony, with one lawmaker describing him as a &ldquo;pathological liar&rdquo; due to his previous false statements to Congress.</p>\n<p>Trump is a &quot;racist,&quot; a &quot;con man&quot; and &quot;a cheat,&quot; Cohen said in his opening statement, alleging that the president not only lied about <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/giuliani-discussions-trump-tower-moscow-were-active-throughout-2016-election-n960701\">his ongoing efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the election</a> but also urged Cohen to lie about them without directly saying so.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LfB-pUUAAAAACholya1Laf2TuFO8pyhvTcnoG0A&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb206NDQz&hl=en&v=vJuUWXolyYJx1oqUVmpPuryQ&theme=light&size=invisible&badge=bottomright&cb=8n3ik5wrdr4l\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Cohen, who worked for Trump for over a decade, addressed why he ultimately lied to Congress in 2017 about the Trump Tower project.</p>\n<p>&quot;Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project. And so I lied about it too,&quot; said Cohen.</p>\n<p>&quot;Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress,&quot; he added.</p>\n<p>Cohen also suggested that the president has not told the truth about why he hasn't released his tax returns to the public, saying he had not done so during his campaign because &quot;an entire group of think tanks&quot; would &quot;start ripping it to pieces,&quot; he might be forced to pay more taxes or penalties, and the move would lead to an audit. Trump has repeatedly said that he does not want release his tax returns because he is already under audit.</p>\n<p>&quot;I presume he is not under audit,&quot; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>And despite parameters set by Democrats that made issues related to the Russia probe off-limits, Cohen used the opportunity to make new claims that contradicted the president&rsquo;s previous statements, including the allegation that Trump knew Roger Stone had spoken to Julian Assange ahead of the WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was in Mr. Trump&rsquo;s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone,&quot; Cohen said. &quot;Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with [WikiLeaks founder] Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of 'wouldn&rsquo;t that be great.'&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen, however, said that he knew of no direct evidence that Trump or his presidential campaign colluded with Russia.</p>\n<p>&quot;I do not. I want to be clear. But I have my suspicions,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>Asked if he knew of other criminal conduct by Trump that hadn't been discussed in the hearing Wednesday, Cohen said, &quot;Yes,&quot; but that he couldn't discuss it because of ongoing federal investigations.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/michael-cohen-hearing-full-opening-statement-before-congress-1449173571978\"><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1240px)\" srcset=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201902/COHEN.focal-860x484.jpg\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 758px)\" srcset=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201902/COHEN.focal-1000x563.jpg\"></source><img src=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201902/COHEN.focal-760x428.jpg\"></img></picture></a></figure>\n<p>The president's former attorney provided the committee with a series of documents, including letters he authored threatening Trump's high school, college and the College Board from releasing his grades and SAT scores, according to Cohen's prepared opening statement. Cohen also presented a pair of reimbursement checks he received for the $130,000 hush payment he made to porn star Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 presidential election to keep her quiet about her allegation of a 2006 affair with Trump &mdash; an affair Trump says did not happen.</p>\n<p>An August 2017 check for $35,000 was signed by Trump, while a March 2017 check for the same amount was signed by both Donald Trump Jr. and Trump Organization Chief Operating Officer Allen Weisselberg.</p>\n<p>Cohen told the panel that Trump had asked him to pay off adult film star Stormy Daniels &quot;with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Mr. Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign,&quot; Cohen said. &quot;And I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later.&quot;</p>\n<p>Asked about reimbursements for the hush money, Cohen said, &quot;He knew about everything, yes. Everything had to go through Mr. Trump, and it had to be approved by Mr. Trump.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen's documentation and testimony, said Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., &quot;raises grave questions about the legality of President Trump's conduct and the truthfulness of his statements while he was president.&quot;</p>\n<p>The top Republican on the committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, former Freedom Caucus chairman, said that Democrats are merely using Cohen because they want to &quot;try to remove the president from office, because Tom Steyer told them to&rdquo; and he accused Cohen of not being remorseful.</p>\n<p>&quot;Shame on you, Mr. Jordan, that's not what I said,&quot; Cohen said, adding that he's being separated from his family and going to prison. &quot;I made mistakes. I own them.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen later added, &quot;All I wanted to say is I just find it interesting, sir, that between yourself and your colleagues that not one question so far since I&rsquo;m here has been asked about President Trump.&quot;</p>\n<p>Trump, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-lands-vietnam-north-korea-summit-shadow-mueller-cohen-loom-n974951\">who is in Vietnam for a nuclear summit</a> with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, attacked Cohen ahead of his testimony, tweeting that his former lawyer &quot;did bad things unrelated to Trump.&quot;</p>\n<p>The House Oversight Committee hearing came a day after Cohen appeared in a closed-door hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. On Thursday, Cohen will meet in closed session with the House Intelligence Committee.</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Michael Cohen, long-time fixer and personal attorney to President Donald Trump, painted a scathing portrait Wednesday of his former boss in Hill testimony alleging Trump approved hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, knew about the 2016 WikiLeaks email dump in advance and had wanted Congress to receive misleading testimony about his ties to Russia.\nCohen, 52, expressed remorse for his actions and his loyalty to Trump during a blockbuster hearing before the House Oversight Committee that lasted more than seven hours.\nCohen described Trump as an \"intoxicating\" presence. \"It seems unbelievable that I was so mesmerized by Donald Trump that I was willing to do things for him that I knew were absolutely wrong,\" he said, offering apologies to Congress, his family and the American people.\n\u201cI regret the day I said 'yes' to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way,\u201d said Cohen in a 20-page opening statement. \u201cI am not protecting Mr. Trump anymore.\u201d\nIn his closing remarks, Cohen addressed the president head-on, occasionally looking straight into the cameras while ticking off items on a lengthy list of criticism of Trump's behavior in office, ranging from his weather-based decision to skip a ceremony honoring veterans to his attacks on law enforcement, the media and others.\n\"You don\u2019t use your power of your bully pulpit to destroy the credibility of those who speak out against you. You don\u2019t separate families from one another or demonize those looking to America for a better life. You don\u2019t vilify people based on the god they pray to, and you don\u2019t cuddle up to our adversaries at the expense of our allies,\" he said.\n\"And finally, you don\u2019t shut down the government before Christmas and New Year\u2019s just to simply appease your base. This behavior is churlish, it denigrates the office of the president and it\u2019s un-American and it\u2019s not you.\"\nCohen is due to report to prison in early May for a three-year sentence for a series of charges he pleaded guilty to last year, including eight felony counts of tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations, as well as one count of making a false statement to Congress. On the eve of his testimony, a New York state court filing revealed that he had been disbarred.\nDemocrats, who now control the committee, asked Cohen questions Wednesday about alleged criminal conduct by Trump while Republican members on the committee largely sought to discredit and delegitimize Cohen\u2019s testimony, with one lawmaker describing him as a \u201cpathological liar\u201d due to his previous false statements to Congress.\nTrump is a \"racist,\" a \"con man\" and \"a cheat,\" Cohen said in his opening statement, alleging that the president not only lied about his ongoing efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the election but also urged Cohen to lie about them without directly saying so.\nCohen, who worked for Trump for over a decade, addressed why he ultimately lied to Congress in 2017 about the Trump Tower project.\n\"Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project. And so I lied about it too,\" said Cohen.\n\"Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress,\" he added.\nCohen also suggested that the president has not told the truth about why he hasn't released his tax returns to the public, saying he had not done so during his campaign because \"an entire group of think tanks\" would \"start ripping it to pieces,\" he might be forced to pay more taxes or penalties, and the move would lead to an audit. Trump has repeatedly said that he does not want release his tax returns because he is already under audit.\n\"I presume he is not under audit,\" Cohen said.\nAnd despite parameters set by Democrats that made issues related to the Russia probe off-limits, Cohen used the opportunity to make new claims that contradicted the president\u2019s previous statements, including the allegation that Trump knew Roger Stone had spoken to Julian Assange ahead of the WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails.\n\u201cI was in Mr. Trump\u2019s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone,\" Cohen said. \"Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with [WikiLeaks founder] Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of 'wouldn\u2019t that be great.'\"\nCohen, however, said that he knew of no direct evidence that Trump or his presidential campaign colluded with Russia.\n\"I do not. I want to be clear. But I have my suspicions,\" he said.\nAsked if he knew of other criminal conduct by Trump that hadn't been discussed in the hearing Wednesday, Cohen said, \"Yes,\" but that he couldn't discuss it because of ongoing federal investigations.\nThe president's former attorney provided the committee with a series of documents, including letters he authored threatening Trump's high school, college and the College Board from releasing his grades and SAT scores, according to Cohen's prepared opening statement. Cohen also presented a pair of reimbursement checks he received for the $130,000 hush payment he made to porn star Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 presidential election to keep her quiet about her allegation of a 2006 affair with Trump \u2014 an affair Trump says did not happen.\nAn August 2017 check for $35,000 was signed by Trump, while a March 2017 check for the same amount was signed by both Donald Trump Jr. and Trump Organization Chief Operating Officer Allen Weisselberg.\nCohen told the panel that Trump had asked him to pay off adult film star Stormy Daniels \"with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it.\"\n\"Mr. Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign,\" Cohen said. \"And I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later.\"\nAsked about reimbursements for the hush money, Cohen said, \"He knew about everything, yes. Everything had to go through Mr. Trump, and it had to be approved by Mr. Trump.\"\nCohen's documentation and testimony, said Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., \"raises grave questions about the legality of President Trump's conduct and the truthfulness of his statements while he was president.\"\nThe top Republican on the committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, former Freedom Caucus chairman, said that Democrats are merely using Cohen because they want to \"try to remove the president from office, because Tom Steyer told them to\u201d and he accused Cohen of not being remorseful.\n\"Shame on you, Mr. Jordan, that's not what I said,\" Cohen said, adding that he's being separated from his family and going to prison. \"I made mistakes. I own them.\"\nCohen later added, \"All I wanted to say is I just find it interesting, sir, that between yourself and your colleagues that not one question so far since I\u2019m here has been asked about President Trump.\"\nTrump, who is in Vietnam for a nuclear summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, attacked Cohen ahead of his testimony, tweeting that his former lawyer \"did bad things unrelated to Trump.\"\nThe House Oversight Committee hearing came a day after Cohen appeared in a closed-door hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. On Thursday, Cohen will meet in closed session with the House Intelligence Committee.",

But I am not calling the gentleman, Mr. Meadows, a racist for doing so.

Not many people know that.

She says as a daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, there's no way she would work for an individual who's a racist.

                "text": "An already tense hearing involving former Trump fixer Michael Cohen got heated when a Democratic congresswoman and a Republican congressman traded accusations of racism.\nThe flareup started when Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., was questioning Cohen and took a swipe at Rep. Mark Meadows for bringing Lynne Patton, a black woman who's friends with the Trump family and works for the federal government, to the hearing as a \"prop.\" Meadows had presented Patton to the hearing to push back against Cohen's claims that the president is a racist.\n\"Just because someone has a person of color, a black person, working for them does not mean they aren't racist, and it is insensitive that some would even say \u2014 the fact that someone would actually use a prop, a black woman, in this chamber, in this committee, is alone racist in itself,\" the freshman Democrat said.\nFeb. 27, 201904:03\nAn angry Meadows demanded Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, strike her comments from the record. \"I'm sure she didn't intend to do this, but if anyone knows my record as it relates, it should be you, Mr. Chairman,\" he said to Cummings.\nAsked to clarify her remarks, Tlaib said, \"I'm just saying that's what I believe to have happened and as a person of color in this committee that's how I felt at that moment, and I wanted to express that. But I am not calling the gentleman, Mr. Meadows, a racist for doing so. I'm saying in itself it is a racist act.\"\nThe North Carolina Republican and close Trump ally denied he'd used Patton as a prop \u2014 and said that accusation was racist.\n\"To indicate that I asked someone who is a personal friend of the Trump family, who has worked for him, who knows this particular individual, that she's coming in to be a prop \u2014 it's racist to suggest that I ask her to come in here for that reason,\" he said. \"She loves this family. She came in because she felt like the president of the United States was getting falsely accused.\"\nHe said he took the accusation especially personally because \"my nieces and nephews are people of color. Not many people know that. You know that, Mr. Chairman.\"\nCummings responded that he could \"see and feel\" Meadows' pain, and referred to him as \"one of my best friends\" before giving Tlaib another opportunity to clarify her remarks.\nShe maintained it wasn't her intention to call Meadows a racist and said, \"I do apologize if that's what it sounded like.\"\n\"As everybody knows in this chamber I'm pretty direct so if I wanted to say that I would have, but that's not what I said,\" she said.\nPatton, now an official at the U.S. Department of Housing and Development, made her unusual cameo appearance earlier in the hearing.\n\"I asked Lynne to come today,\" Meadows told Cohen as she stood behind the congressman.\n\"You made some very demeaning comments about the president Ms. Patton doesn't agree with. She says as a daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, there's no way she would work for an individual who's a racist. How do you reconcile that? \"\nCohen responded, \"Ask Ms. Patton how many people who are black are executives at the Trump Organization. The answer is zero.\"",

One more in a long list of things you are not. Honest. Brave. Smart. Tough. Disciplined. Kind. Generous. Patriotic. A fan of John McCain,\" wrote Salter, who served as a speechwriter for, and co-author of many books by, McCain.\n\"Had you been a fan, the Senator would have wondered what he had done so wrong that he earned the approval of a man he despised,\" Salter added.\nOk you aren't a fan.

I like people that weren't captured,\u201d Trump said of the storied Vietnam veteran.\nTrump had lashed out at McCain last weekend, accusing him of sending a Trump opposition-research dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele into the hands of multiple media outlets in late 2016.\nThe president was responding to reports in conservative media outlets that cited court documents saying a former aide to the Republican senator was the source of a leak that put a Trump opposition-research dossier into the hands of multiple media outlets in late 2016.\nMcCain gave a version of the dossier to the FBI in December 2016, after the presidential election, and asked if any of it was true, but he had denied being a source of the document for BuzzFeed, which published it in January 2017.",

Families with children under 18, however, will not be affected because of a federal court decision that prevents minors from being held longer than 20 days.\nThe Obama administration was criticized in 2014 for placing bonds so high that immigrants could not afford them.\nBarr's decision could be problematic for ICE, where space to hold detained immigrants is already extremely limited. Many private prison companies and state and local jails are awarded ICE contracts to hold surplus immigrants.",

In communications with banks, Cohen reported that his net worth cratered between 2014 and 2017 \u2014 dropping from $75.9 million to negative $12.2 million due to the depreciation of his real estate assets and taxi medallion investments.\n\"From my review of a summary of bank records that were scheduled by forensic accountants, I have learned that Cohen had approximately $5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of Sept. 30, 2017,\" an FBI agent says in the court documents.\nIt's unclear how an investigation that started with suspected bank fraud led to a probe of possible campaign finance crimes related to the payouts to Daniels and McDougal. The roughly 19 pages of the search warrant that detail the hush money scheme are all redacted, suggesting that it remains part of an ongoing probe.\nThe documents show that Mueller's office was also investigating Cohen for a previously-unknown allegation: that he was acting as an unregistered foreign agent.\nThousands of dollars from companies with overseas ties began flowing into Cohen's bank accounts in the days and months after Trump took office, according to the search warrants.\nFrom January 2017 to August 2017, Cohen received seven monthly payments totaling $583,332 from Columbus Nova, an investment management firm controlled by Renova Group. The court documents describe Renova Group as a Switzerland-based company controlled by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg.\nSpokespersons for Columbus Nova say the management firm is owned and controlled by Americans and not Vekselberg, whose links to Cohen emerged last year when Stormy Daniels' attorney Michael Avenatti detailed the transaction in a dossier posted to Twitter.\nCohen was also paid $600,000 by South Korean aircraft company Korea Aerospace Industries, and a Kazahkstani bank, Kazkommertsbank, deposited $150,000 into one of his accounts, according to the search warrants.\nAn FBI agent wrote in the documents that the payments appeared to stem from \"political consulting work, including consulting for international clients on issues pending before the Trump administration.\"\nCohen, who is slated to begin a three-year prison sentence in May, was ultimately not charged with acting as an unregistered foreign agent.\nThe warrants describe the use of a \"triggerfish\" cellphone surveillance device to pinpoint the location of Cohen who was using a room at the Loews Regency hotel in Manhattan. They also sought and obtained a \"pen register\" or \"trap and trace\" warrant to find out who Cohen was calling and receiving phone calls from, but without the ability to listen or monitor those calls.\nLast December, Cohen was sentenced to three years behind bars for what a Manhattan federal court judge called a \"veritable smorgasbord\" of criminal conduct.\nCohen had earlier pleaded guilty to making secret payments to Daniels and McDougal, lying to Congress about the president's business dealings with Russia, and failing to report millions of dollars in income.\nThe president and White House have denied the affairs.\nCohen's attorney Lanny Davis, speaking ahead of the search warrants' release, said Monday that it \"only furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump organization to law enforcement and Congress.\"",

                "text": "President Donald Trump personally signed off on a U.S. military cyber operation that blocked internet access for a Russian troll farm during the 2018 midterm election, multiple sources briefed on the matter told NBC News.\nThe action by U.S. Cyber Command against the Internet Research Agency (IRA) \u2014 first reported Tuesday by The Washington Post \u2014 marks the most aggressive known move to date by the Trump administration to combat Russian election interference.\nThe IRA has been charged by special counsel Robert Mueller with interfering in the 2016 election. Financed by a Kremlin-connected oligarch, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the St. Peterburg-based company employed Russians who posed as Americans on social media and sought to sow division in U.S. politics by launching and amplifying extreme messages at the far ends of the political spectrum, according to federal prosecutors.\nU.S. Cyber Command, working with intelligence gathered by the National Security Agency, shut down internet access at the facility in the hours before the 2018 midterms and for a few days afterward, the sources said.\nEmployees of the IRA complained to their IT department about the disruption, the sources said.\n\u201cI would not be surprised if the IRA is extremely frustrated right now,\u201d John Hultquist, chief of intelligence at cyber security firm FireEye, told NBC News.\nU.S. intelligence agencies are believed to be closely monitoring the activities of the IRA, but it's far more difficult for the government and private social media companies to deal with the broader phenomenon of social media manipulation.\nBots and trolls have been avoiding detection by creating less original content and merely amplifying extremist messages from politicians and other legitimate sources, Hultquist said.\nThe military operation against the IRA was part of a larger effort by Cyber Command, led by Gen. Paul Nakasone, to strike against attempts to interfere in U.S. politics ahead of the midterm elections, the sources said.\nTrump approved the broader effort, but he also signed off on the specific operation to strike the Internet Research Agency, a U.S. official with direct knowledge told NBC News.\nThe White House declined comment.\nJoseph Holstead, a Cyber Command spokesman, said: \"We do not discuss classified cyberspace planning and operations. U.S. Cyber Command will continue to work as part of the whole-of-government effort to defend our elections and democratic institutions from foreign malign influence.\"\nPrigozhin told the Post in a statement he had no connection to the IRA. A company he controls, Concord Management, is fighting the Mueller case in federal court, but Prigozhin, believed to be in Russia, has not appeared.\nTrump has spoken favorably about Russian President Vladimir Putin and has cast doubt on U.S. intelligence assessments describing Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference, but his administration has imposed new sanctions on Russia over a massive cyberattack and over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in London.\nU.S. intelligence agencies said they did not see the same level of interference from Russia in 2018 as happened in 2016, when a Russian intelligence campaign of hacking and leaking sought to help Trump and hurt his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\nHowever, private cybersecurity analysts have told NBC News they see evidence that Russia is ramping up efforts that could lead to interference in 2020.\nThere is no known U.S. government-wide strategy to combat foreign election interference, and Trump last year scrapped the position of White House cybersecurity advisor.",

a tacit acknowledgment that protecting the president's reputation was a more difficult charge.</p>\n<p>And while the dam has hardly broken, Trump is seeing more cracks in the coalition of Republicans willing to support the national emergency he declared to fund a border wall without congressional consent.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., took to the Senate floor to offer an admonition to Trump, asking him to reconsider the move.</p>\n<p>&quot;There has never been an instance where a president of the United States has asked for funding, Congress refused it and the president then has used the National Emergency Act to justify the funding anyway,&quot; Alexander said.</p>\n<p>Alexander stopped short of saying he would vote for a House-passed resolution terminating the emergency declaration, but he escalated the pressure on Trump from within his own party to abandon his plan to execute an end-run around Congress, with the effort to nullify his emergency declaration now potentially just one GOP vote away from approval. On Tuesday, with Trump in Vietnam, 13 House Republicans voted with a unified House Democratic Caucus to cancel the emergency.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/alexander-suggests-trump-find-other-funding-for-wall-1450298947896\"><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1240px)\" srcset=\"https://media12.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201903/f_mo_alexander_funding_190228_1920x1080.focal-860x484.jpg\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 758px)\" srcset=\"https://media12.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201903/f_mo_alexander_funding_190228_1920x1080.focal-1000x563.jpg\"></source><img src=\"https://media12.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201903/f_mo_alexander_funding_190228_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg\"></img></picture></a></figure>\n<p>Feb. 28, 201904:55</p>\n<p>Ron Bonjean, a former Republican congressional leadership aide and a partner at the firm Rokk Solutions, said the resistance to Trump within the GOP won't get worse if he retains the backing of the party's core voters.</p>\n<p>&quot;He&rsquo;s actually getting rather light Senate Republican pushback on the emergency declaration compared to what it could be at this moment by circumventing Congress,&quot; Bonjean said. &quot;As long as the base stays with the president, most Republicans are not breaking from Trump for fear of facing a primary challenge back home.&quot;</p>\n<p>Bonjean added that while many Republicans weren't sure what to make of the Kim summit at the outset, &quot;walking away from Hanoi early was considered a smart thing to do for the country and he deserves the praise for not reaching for a deal that wasn't there to be made.&quot;</p>\n<p>Not only was Trump, the leader of the free world, unable to bend Kim, the tin pot dictator of one of the world's last remaining &quot;rogue&quot; nations, to his will, Kim left the deal-seeking Trump walking away from the altar amid a dispute between the two countries over just what was in dispute.</p>\n<p>To add intellectual insult to injured American pride, Trump said that he believed North Korea's Kim Jong Un's claim not to have known anything about the treatment of Otto Warmbier, an American who died shortly after returning home from more than a year in captivity in North Korea &mdash; an assertion of ignorance that former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/inconceivable-kim-jong-un-wasn-t-aware-otto-warmbier-ex-n977696\">said was &quot;totally impossible.&quot;</a></p>\n<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden, who served for many years as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Thursday that he hopes the summit debacle was a teaching moment for Trump.</p>\n<p>&quot;I hope I don't come across as condescending, because I don't mean it,&quot; Biden, who is considering a run for president in 2020, said. &quot;I hope the president has learned a really important lesson: Diplomacy matters, preparation matters.&quot;</p>\n<p>Another thing Trump learned for sure: Spending a few days on the road can't keep you from enduring a truly terrible week in Washington, too.</p>",

                "text": "HANOI, Vietnam \u2014 President Donald Trump touched down in Washington a few hours ago having endured a brutal stretch overseas in which the limits of his power at home and abroad, and the perils of his personal conduct, were revealed all at once and in humiliating fashion.\nHere in Southeast Asia, half a world away from home, Trump behaved solicitously toward a notorious dictator before backing away from what even his staunchest allies saw as a potentially calamitous nuclear deal only at the last minute, leaving himself no obvious path forward for an elusive goal \u2014 bringing North Korea back into the community of nations \u2014 that has been a central piece of his foreign policy agenda.\n\"High-level diplomacy can carry high-level risks,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a nod to the breakdown in negotiations, \"but the president is to be commended for walking away when it became clear insufficient progress had been made on de-nuclearization.\"\nFeb. 28, 201903:25\nBack home, Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, was laying out a narrative of Trump as the consummate \"con man,\" while fellow Republicans declined to defend the president's behavior, began to distance themselves more clearly from his effort to use executive authority to build a border wall and cheered his failure to strike a deal with Kim.\nIt may have been one of the worst weeks of Trump's presidency, concentrated in just a few harrowing days.\nOn Wednesday, in compelling congressional testimony, Cohen portrayed the president as a businessman who played fast and loose with tax laws, his charity's money and payments to contractors, and as a candidate who had little regard for the law in directing Cohen to provide hush money to cover up alleged marital infidelity, pursuing a real estate development in Moscow during the 2016 election and discussing the benefits of WikiLeaks releasing stolen Democratic National Committee emails to help his fortunes.\nThe public session brought signs Trump was losing some steam \u2014 albeit at the margins \u2014 with his cheering section: fellow Republicans in Congress.\nRather than defend Trump, House Republicans on the Oversight and Reform Committee chose to attack Cohen's character \u2014 a tacit acknowledgment that protecting the president's reputation was a more difficult charge.\nAnd while the dam has hardly broken, Trump is seeing more cracks in the coalition of Republicans willing to support the national emergency he declared to fund a border wall without congressional consent.\nOn Thursday, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., took to the Senate floor to offer an admonition to Trump, asking him to reconsider the move.\n\"There has never been an instance where a president of the United States has asked for funding, Congress refused it and the president then has used the National Emergency Act to justify the funding anyway,\" Alexander said.\nAlexander stopped short of saying he would vote for a House-passed resolution terminating the emergency declaration, but he escalated the pressure on Trump from within his own party to abandon his plan to execute an end-run around Congress, with the effort to nullify his emergency declaration now potentially just one GOP vote away from approval. On Tuesday, with Trump in Vietnam, 13 House Republicans voted with a unified House Democratic Caucus to cancel the emergency.\nFeb. 28, 201904:55\nRon Bonjean, a former Republican congressional leadership aide and a partner at the firm Rokk Solutions, said the resistance to Trump within the GOP won't get worse if he retains the backing of the party's core voters.\n\"He\u2019s actually getting rather light Senate Republican pushback on the emergency declaration compared to what it could be at this moment by circumventing Congress,\" Bonjean said. \"As long as the base stays with the president, most Republicans are not breaking from Trump for fear of facing a primary challenge back home.\"\nBonjean added that while many Republicans weren't sure what to make of the Kim summit at the outset, \"walking away from Hanoi early was considered a smart thing to do for the country and he deserves the praise for not reaching for a deal that wasn't there to be made.\"\nNot only was Trump, the leader of the free world, unable to bend Kim, the tin pot dictator of one of the world's last remaining \"rogue\" nations, to his will, Kim left the deal-seeking Trump walking away from the altar amid a dispute between the two countries over just what was in dispute.\nTo add intellectual insult to injured American pride, Trump said that he believed North Korea's Kim Jong Un's claim not to have known anything about the treatment of Otto Warmbier, an American who died shortly after returning home from more than a year in captivity in North Korea \u2014 an assertion of ignorance that former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson said was \"totally impossible.\"\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, who served for many years as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Thursday that he hopes the summit debacle was a teaching moment for Trump.\n\"I hope I don't come across as condescending, because I don't mean it,\" Biden, who is considering a run for president in 2020, said. \"I hope the president has learned a really important lesson: Diplomacy matters, preparation matters.\"\nAnother thing Trump learned for sure: Spending a few days on the road can't keep you from enduring a truly terrible week in Washington, too.",

She said she found the app after dealing with a &ldquo;post-grad crisis&rdquo; after college. Now, it helps her relax and fall asleep.</p>\n<p>But like the many other smartphone notifications Cheng receives throughout the day, she isn&rsquo;t always in the mood to hear from Headspace.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I set a reminder on Headspace to send me a notification to remember to use it,&rdquo; Cheng said. &ldquo;But it makes me laugh because sometimes I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to pick up my phone right now.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Smartphones have trickled into almost every part of modern existence, and meditation and wellness are no exception. Device use is so common, detox programs are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/business/cell-phone-addiction.html\">now popular</a> &mdash; and the average person receives 65 to 80 notifications a day, according to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-improve-smartphone-notifications-2018-4\">research from Duke University</a>. The paradox that even meditation apps may be the cause of anxiety has not stopped millions from turning to devices for relief, making it a lucrative new market in the app economy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It does seem silly that it&rsquo;s just another thing to do on my phone,&rdquo; said Sarah Gordon, 25, a project coordinator at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, who pays for Headspace and uses it almost every day. &ldquo;Even though I don&rsquo;t touch my phone while using the app, the second I open my eyes, I notice myself go to grab my phone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Users like Cheng and Gordon have contributed to the growth of this new market, proving consumers are willing to pay for apps that provide some mental relief. Cheng pays &ldquo;just under $100 a year&rdquo; for the apps, a price she says is worth it. Calm, another popular meditation and sleep app, charges about $70 for a year.</p>\n<p>That success has been met with sizable investments from venture capital firms. Headspace has raised $75 million from investors, while Calm recently topped that, raising $88 million and being valued at around $1 billion.</p>\n<blockquote data-cards=\"hidden\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-partner=\"tweetdeck\"><p>I&rsquo;ve never once opened the headspace app because their notifications awaken such a pure rage from deep within</p>&mdash; Lauren Franklin (@Franklinsays) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Franklinsays/status/1103958147390160902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<p>The rise of these apps has coincided with growing concern among consumer advocates, wellness gurus and even <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-wants-help-you-deal-smartphone-addiction-n879951\">big tech companies</a> about smartphone addiction. Michael Acton Smith, co-founder and co-CEO of Calm, said that smartphones can still be a force for good.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The mobile phone gets a lot of bad press, but if you use it correctly, it&rsquo;s an incredibly positive thing in our lives,&rdquo; Acton Smith said.</p>\n<p>He noted that wellness apps have gained popularity due to a cultural shift away from overworking.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A few years ago, people would show off how little sleep they had,&rdquo; Acton Smith said. &ldquo;Now, people are horrified by that.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LfB-pUUAAAAACholya1Laf2TuFO8pyhvTcnoG0A&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb206NDQz&hl=en&v=vJuUWXolyYJx1oqUVmpPuryQ&theme=light&size=invisible&badge=bottomright&cb=h097n6944rhm\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>That cultural shift is something investors hope to capitalize on.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Look at Nike. People took running, branded it, and made it a lifestyle,&rdquo; Nicolas Wittenborn, a principal at Insight Venture Partners, one of the investors in Calm, said. &ldquo;Yes, there was a business purpose, but it helped people become more fit and have a healthy lifestyle. We want Calm to take a similar path.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sleep, wellness and meditation have already shown signs of becoming fodder for new lifestyle brands. Arianna Huffington, co-founder of HuffPost, turned herself into <a href=\"http://ariannahuffington.com/sleep-resources\">a sleep guru</a>, while a broader industry has grown around the idea of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/06/04/531051473/the-millennial-obsession-with-self-care\">self-care</a>.</p>\n<p>Kevin Rose, an internet entrepreneur who is now a venture capitalist at True Ventures, operates <a href=\"https://medium.com/@kevinrose/oak-meditation-f8478d9fc00\">meditation app Oak</a>, which is free. Rose said that while he sees benefits in the apps, he also noted that they're a good business because they are relatively inexpensive to run.</p>\n<p>Rose said Oak supports more than 140,000 monthly users and only costs about $700 per month to run, making it reasonably easy for him to offer it free.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re phenomenal businesses if you look at the margins,&rdquo; Rose said of meditation apps. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t cost these mediation companies anything to serve this content. It&rsquo;s really inexpensive to create and ... these concepts have been around forever.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While it might not cost much to record a guided meditation, it is a bit more expensive when it's read by Hollywood actor <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/matthew-mcconaughey-calm-sleep-story-1203034618/\">Matthew McConaughey</a>, like on Calm.</p>\n<p>Rose said that paying customers can be more engaged due to the value they put on the apps but said that he has some reservations about what the business model means for users.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think a lot of the apps today, the way they frame it is they just have large amounts of content,&rdquo; Rose said. &ldquo;I worry about people thinking they need the next pack.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We want people to get off their phone and actually practice on their own,&rdquo; Rose said.</p>\n<p>Experts that spoke with NBC News said meditation and sleep apps can be good for people trying to manage stress, but are not without drawbacks.</p>\n<blockquote data-lang=\"en\"><p>I hate when software I use to improve my depression (ie meditation and fitness apps) use a streak tracker. It just makes me feel even worse about my bad days when I can&rsquo;t keep up. Feels like yet one more failure.</p>&mdash; Bearcat in the Hat (@bearcatinthehat) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bearcatinthehat/status/953467184436600833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 17, 2018</a></blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;There have been a lot of studies of meditation and its benefits, both for physical and mental health,&rdquo; Janet Kennedy, a sleep doctor in New York City, said.</p>\n<p>Dr. Dianne M. Augelli, an assistant professor at the Weill Cornell Medicine Center for Sleep Medicine and physician at New York Presbyterian, cautioned that sleep and wellness can be complex issues that won&rsquo;t be solved by an app.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Expectations need to be tempered about what they can do,&rdquo; Augelli said.</p>\n<p>One obvious impediment to sleep the apps pose that both Augelli and Kennedy pointed out: screen time.</p>\n<p>Screens emit &ldquo;blue light,&rdquo; a type of wavelength that suppresses melatonin, one of our main hormones for sleep.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Some of the apps are just audio, which is fine, but we don't recommend any that flash or that have you look at an orb to do your breathing work,&rdquo; Augelli said.</p>\n<p>Kennedy also worries the apps are making their users overthink sleep.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is a downside to all of the attention sleep is getting,&rdquo; she said. Most of the apps offer streaks and track how much you use them. Some record how much you end up sleeping.</p>\n<p>Kennedy thinks sleep shouldn&rsquo;t be something you set a goal for, like training a marathon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a different process. Your body is going to do what it&rsquo;s going to do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Augelli says that if the apps are helping people wind down before bed, that&rsquo;s a good thing. &ldquo;Some people will read, some people will listen to something on an app that is soothing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not too long ago people had CDs or tapes to help them fall asleep.&rdquo; Now, Augelli said, they use apps.</p>",

                "text": "Courtney Cheng\u2019s smartphone reminds her when it\u2019s time to meditate.\nCheng, 25, a nonprofit project manager in the San Francisco Bay Area, is a paying member of Headspace, one of a handful of apps focused on meditation and wellness that have accrued millions of users \u2014 and millions of dollars in venture capital investments. She said she found the app after dealing with a \u201cpost-grad crisis\u201d after college. Now, it helps her relax and fall asleep.\nBut like the many other smartphone notifications Cheng receives throughout the day, she isn\u2019t always in the mood to hear from Headspace.\n\u201cI set a reminder on Headspace to send me a notification to remember to use it,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cBut it makes me laugh because sometimes I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to pick up my phone right now.\u2019\u201d\nSmartphones have trickled into almost every part of modern existence, and meditation and wellness are no exception. Device use is so common, detox programs are now popular \u2014 and the average person receives 65 to 80 notifications a day, according to research from Duke University. The paradox that even meditation apps may be the cause of anxiety has not stopped millions from turning to devices for relief, making it a lucrative new market in the app economy.\n\u201cIt does seem silly that it\u2019s just another thing to do on my phone,\u201d said Sarah Gordon, 25, a project coordinator at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, who pays for Headspace and uses it almost every day. \u201cEven though I don\u2019t touch my phone while using the app, the second I open my eyes, I notice myself go to grab my phone.\u201d\nUsers like Cheng and Gordon have contributed to the growth of this new market, proving consumers are willing to pay for apps that provide some mental relief. Cheng pays \u201cjust under $100 a year\u201d for the apps, a price she says is worth it. Calm, another popular meditation and sleep app, charges about $70 for a year.\nThat success has been met with sizable investments from venture capital firms. Headspace has raised $75 million from investors, while Calm recently topped that, raising $88 million and being valued at around $1 billion.\nI\u2019ve never once opened the headspace app because their notifications awaken such a pure rage from deep within\n\u2014 Lauren Franklin (@Franklinsays) March 8, 2019\nThe rise of these apps has coincided with growing concern among consumer advocates, wellness gurus and even big tech companies about smartphone addiction. Michael Acton Smith, co-founder and co-CEO of Calm, said that smartphones can still be a force for good.\n\u201cThe mobile phone gets a lot of bad press, but if you use it correctly, it\u2019s an incredibly positive thing in our lives,\u201d Acton Smith said.\nHe noted that wellness apps have gained popularity due to a cultural shift away from overworking.\n\u201cA few years ago, people would show off how little sleep they had,\u201d Acton Smith said. \u201cNow, people are horrified by that.\u201d\nThat cultural shift is something investors hope to capitalize on.\n\u201cLook at Nike. People took running, branded it, and made it a lifestyle,\u201d Nicolas Wittenborn, a principal at Insight Venture Partners, one of the investors in Calm, said. \u201cYes, there was a business purpose, but it helped people become more fit and have a healthy lifestyle. We want Calm to take a similar path.\u201d\nSleep, wellness and meditation have already shown signs of becoming fodder for new lifestyle brands. Arianna Huffington, co-founder of HuffPost, turned herself into a sleep guru, while a broader industry has grown around the idea of self-care.\nKevin Rose, an internet entrepreneur who is now a venture capitalist at True Ventures, operates meditation app Oak, which is free. Rose said that while he sees benefits in the apps, he also noted that they're a good business because they are relatively inexpensive to run.\nRose said Oak supports more than 140,000 monthly users and only costs about $700 per month to run, making it reasonably easy for him to offer it free.\n\u201cThey\u2019re phenomenal businesses if you look at the margins,\u201d Rose said of meditation apps. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost these mediation companies anything to serve this content. It\u2019s really inexpensive to create and ... these concepts have been around forever.\u201d\nWhile it might not cost much to record a guided meditation, it is a bit more expensive when it's read by Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey, like on Calm.\nRose said that paying customers can be more engaged due to the value they put on the apps but said that he has some reservations about what the business model means for users.\n\u201cI think a lot of the apps today, the way they frame it is they just have large amounts of content,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI worry about people thinking they need the next pack.\u201d\n\u201cWe want people to get off their phone and actually practice on their own,\u201d Rose said.\nExperts that spoke with NBC News said meditation and sleep apps can be good for people trying to manage stress, but are not without drawbacks.\nI hate when software I use to improve my depression (ie meditation and fitness apps) use a streak tracker. It just makes me feel even worse about my bad days when I can\u2019t keep up. Feels like yet one more failure.\n\u2014 Bearcat in the Hat (@bearcatinthehat) January 17, 2018\n\u201cThere have been a lot of studies of meditation and its benefits, both for physical and mental health,\u201d Janet Kennedy, a sleep doctor in New York City, said.\nDr. Dianne M. Augelli, an assistant professor at the Weill Cornell Medicine Center for Sleep Medicine and physician at New York Presbyterian, cautioned that sleep and wellness can be complex issues that won\u2019t be solved by an app.\n\u201cExpectations need to be tempered about what they can do,\u201d Augelli said.\nOne obvious impediment to sleep the apps pose that both Augelli and Kennedy pointed out: screen time.\nScreens emit \u201cblue light,\u201d a type of wavelength that suppresses melatonin, one of our main hormones for sleep.\n\u201cSome of the apps are just audio, which is fine, but we don't recommend any that flash or that have you look at an orb to do your breathing work,\u201d Augelli said.\nKennedy also worries the apps are making their users overthink sleep.\n\u201cThere is a downside to all of the attention sleep is getting,\u201d she said. Most of the apps offer streaks and track how much you use them. Some record how much you end up sleeping.\nKennedy thinks sleep shouldn\u2019t be something you set a goal for, like training a marathon. \u201cIt\u2019s a different process. Your body is going to do what it\u2019s going to do.\u201d\nUltimately, Augelli says that if the apps are helping people wind down before bed, that\u2019s a good thing. \u201cSome people will read, some people will listen to something on an app that is soothing.\u201d\n\u201cNot too long ago people had CDs or tapes to help them fall asleep.\u201d Now, Augelli said, they use apps.",
