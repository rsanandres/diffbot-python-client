She&rsquo;s merely one of 44 Democrats who blocked a bill that would have saved all babies from negligent homicide. Presidential candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders all voted against Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/311/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22S.+311%22%7D&r=2&s=2\">Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act</a>, as well.</p>\n<p>Senate Democrats unsurprisingly struggled to find an effective way to lie about opposing a bill that prohibits abortion in the fourth trimester. Some of them maintained that Sasse&rsquo;s bill was superfluous because all the things in it were already illegal. Others claimed the bill <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/02/ben-sasse-wants-to-ban-infanticide-after-botched-abortions/\">would</a> &ldquo;restrict doctors from making case-by-case decisions about what is best for infants and mothers.&rdquo; Still others claimed the practice never ever happens. Other Democrats, who support government intervention in every nook and cranny of human existence, argued that tough choices should only be the domain of women and their doctors, not the state. Many of them saw no conflict between these ideas and argued all these things at the very same time.</p>\n<p>Sen. Patty Murray <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-blocks-bill-on-medical-care-for-children-born-alive-after-attempted-abortion/2019/02/25/e5d3d4d8-3924-11e9-a06c-3ec8ed509d15_story.html\">claimed</a> the bill was &ldquo;clearly anti-doctor, anti-woman and anti-family&rdquo; and that &ldquo;proponents claim it would make something illegal that is already illegal.&rdquo; This is untrue, <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/12/political-journalists-are-trying-to-gaslight-america/\">regardless of a full-court press from Democrats and the media</a>. As bills in both Virginia and New York clearly illustrate, the practice isn&rsquo;t illegal. Both bills specifically provide legal protections for doctors who terminate babies who survive abortion attempts.</p>\n<p>This was the practice Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia hamfistedly explained to us on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkTopSKo1xs\">video</a>, forgetting to use the standard euphemisms typically used to conceal the horrific specifics of the procedure. In New York, abortion&mdash;and post-birth termination&mdash;of a viable, once-healthy infant is legal through the entire pregnancy, and after, for virtually any reason. The rite of abortion is so intrinsic to progressive ideology (and coffers) that not one major player on the left had the moral spine to condemn either.</p>\n<p>Leana Wen, the president of the state-funded abortion mill Planned Parenthood, <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/b0d4abdf485a495a9c64896d4681f5fa\">argued</a> that the Sasse legislation was &ldquo;based on lies and a misinformation campaign, aimed at shaming women and criminalizing doctors for a practice that doesn&rsquo;t exist in medicine or reality.&rdquo; Why would Wen oppose criminalizing a procedure that doesn&rsquo;t exist in medicine or reality? And if it did exist, would Wen support banning the practice? Has anyone in truth-seeking media asked her?</p>\n<p>The reality is that Sasse&rsquo;s bill exempted mothers from prosecution, and would have merely required medical professionals to &ldquo;exercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.&rdquo; Nothing in the bill would have inhibited the doctors from making choices about critically ill infants. Conflating the experience of couples who lose a sick child to those who terminate a healthy one is both fraudulent and immoral itself. Then again, a bill that asks doctors to fulfill their oath of keeping babies alive is in direct competition with Wen&rsquo;s professional mission.</p>\n<p>As National Review&rsquo;s Alexandra DeSanctis <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xan_desanctis/status/1100246423403196416\">points out</a>, the media did its customary job of running interference for Democrats. Take this Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/senate-defeats-anti-abortion-bill-1185531\">piece</a>, for example, which is teeming with the usual deceptive language, referring to Sasse&rsquo;s bill as &ldquo;anti-abortion&rdquo;&mdash;as did many other outlets, <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/b0d4abdf485a495a9c64896d4681f5fa\">including the Associated Press</a>&mdash;though it would not stop anyone from performing a single abortion in this country. Most of the media portrayed the debate as a cynical election ploy to &ldquo;to squeeze Democrats ahead of the 2020 campaign.&rdquo; The bill was filibustered, with three Democrats voting for it. President Trump would surely sign it. Does anyone doubt conservatives want it passed?</p>\n<p>Is it cynical to put politicians on the record for their beliefs? Is it cynical it point out that the majority of elected Democrats &ndash; including every presidential hopeful in the Senate &mdash; are, judging from <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/02/25/poll-shows-dramatic-shift-in-americans-attitude-toward-abortion/\">polling numbers</a>, far to the left of the country? Although polls have consistently shown that large majorities of Americans oppose all third-trimester abortions, I can&rsquo;t find one that asks if they support the practice of aborting infants who had the temerity to survive a third-trimester abortion. I wonder what the numbers would look like on that question.</p>\n<p>One of most durable talking points for abortion has to do with the notion that if a <em>thing</em> is in a woman&rsquo;s body then it is a woman&rsquo;s choice what do with that thing, even if that thing happens to be a unique and viable human being.

That bill sought to amend the school code to <em>require </em>the Child Protective Service unit of the Department of Children and Family Services to investigate the home of a child being homeschooled &ldquo;to ensure there is no suspected child abuse or neglect in the home.&rdquo; The proposed law would have applied to every child being homeschooled, even when there was no reason to suspect neglect or abuse.</p>\n<p>The response of homeschooling families was swift. &ldquo;We live in such a &lsquo;guilty until proven innocent&rsquo; culture,&rdquo; Amy Kwilinski, an Illinois homeschooling mom of six (including four with special needs) told The Federalist. &ldquo;It seems like our culture is headed toward a mistrust of homeschooling, which might send us dangerously toward a German-like ban,&rdquo; Kwilinski added, noting that she plans to contact all of her elected officials.</p>\n<p>Other homeschooling parents apparently felt similarly, because within days of Bristow&rsquo;s bill being referred to the Rules Committee, the sponsor <a href=\"http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=3560&GAID=15&DocTypeID=HB&LegId=120234&SessionID=108&GA=101&fbclid=IwAR1LC3fN9DJmdxTfOQ0rM_e5eRk0L7Bbm7IEvcWiUjBuzURSposvoSpQ8Hw\">filed</a> a motion to table the bill. In less than a week, HB 3560 was dead.</p>\n<p>Scott Woodruff, senior counsel with Home School Legal Defense Association told The Federalist that Bristow&rsquo;s &ldquo;bill struck a raw nerve among homeschool families.&rdquo; &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to be treated like criminals. Who wants to be investigated for child abuse for absolutely no other reason than choosing to homeschool your child?&rdquo; Woodruff said. &ldquo;It also would have been a fabulous waste of the limited time that child protective workers have to protect kids who are in trouble,&rdquo; Woodruff added.</p>\n<h2>A Different Bill Attempts to Surveil Families In Iowa</h2>\n<p>While the Illinois bill is essentially dead, a similar bill remains under consideration in Iowa. Late last month, representatives in Iowa introduced a <a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF100&ga=88\">bill</a> that would require school districts to conduct &ldquo;quarterly home visits to check on the health and safety of children&rdquo; being homeschooled. The bill specified that &ldquo;home visits shall take place in the child&rsquo;s residence with the consent of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian and an interview or observation of the child may be conducted.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Unlike the Illinois bill, which would have forced parents to allow the government to investigate their homes and children before they could homeschool&mdash;likely an unconstitutional condition&mdash;the Iowa bill at least recognized that such inspections require the consent of the parent or guardian. However, the following section stated that &ldquo;if permission to enter the home to interview or observe the child is refused, the juvenile court or district court upon a showing of probable cause may authorize the person making the home visit to enter the home and interview or observe the child.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This probable cause provision raises several red flags. First, the proposed bill does not specify <em>what </em>there must be &ldquo;probable cause&rdquo; of. The most reasonable interpretation would be &ldquo;probable cause&rdquo; of neglect or abuse, which leads to the second point: The law <em>already </em>allows the government to obtain a court order to enter a home upon a showing of &ldquo;probable cause&rdquo; of neglect or abuse, so why the need to amend the code regulating homeschooling?</p>\n<p>There is no need. Rather, the Iowa bill would provide school officials the ability to bully parents by demanding entry, knowing many homeschoolers would not realize they could refuse to consent. For those parents who know their rights and exercise them, they risk retaliation when the school districts later review the objecting parents&rsquo; homeschool curriculum. Even worse, the school officials might present unfounded claims of neglect to a court which, given the normal <em>ex parte</em> (without notifying the parents of the court filing) proceedings, may authorize the government&rsquo;s invasion of the family&rsquo;s home.</p>\n<p>That the Iowa bill seeks to target homeschool families under the auspices of &ldquo;protecting the children&rdquo; seems clear when you consider the law already provides a mechanism to enter homes when cause exists to believe children are suffering from neglect or abuse. The bill&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/lobbyist/reports/declarations?ga=88&ba=HF100\">backing</a> from the Iowa State Education Association, an <a href=\"https://isea.org/\">association</a> that sells itself &ldquo;an integral part of the 3 million-member National Education Association,&rdquo; is another huge tell.</p>\n<h2>Parents Are Not the Enemy</h2>\n<p>Whether the Iowa bill, which has been in committee for nearly a month, will suffer the same fate as the Illinois one is yet to be seen. But the mere proposal of these bills should serve as a wake-up call to all parents of the trend among policymakers to view them as the enemy. While these two bills focused on homeschooling, the same perspective on parental rights&mdash;that the state knows best, parents be damned&mdash;can be seen in legislative branches throughout the country.</p>\n<p>For instance, in Indiana, last year the legislature <a href=\"Desktophttps://thefederalist.com/2018/02/21/indiana-house-guts-informed-consent-bill-trans-ideology-public-schools/\">gutted</a> a law that would have required schools to provide parents access to materials used for instruction on sexual activity and gender identity and to obtain their consent before &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; kids about gender identity. South Dakota&rsquo;s legislature recently <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/12/lgbt-activists-teaching-judges-yank-kids-parents-wont-transgender/\">killed</a> a bill expressly protecting a parent&rsquo;s right to refuse to consent to health care &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; for a child that would promote the child&rsquo;s belief that he is a she, or vice versa.</p>\n<p>The aggressive move to replace a parent&rsquo;s love, care, guidance, and decision-making with whatever whim the experts of the bureaucratic state currently profess is a disturbing and growing trend, and it threatens all parents&mdash;not merely those homeschooling their children.</p>\n<p>Margot Cleveland is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

South Dakota\u2019s legislature recently killed a bill expressly protecting a parent\u2019s right to refuse to consent to health care \u201ctreatment\u201d for a child that would promote the child\u2019s belief that he is a she, or vice versa.\nThe aggressive move to replace a parent\u2019s love, care, guidance, and decision-making with whatever whim the experts of the bureaucratic state currently profess is a disturbing and growing trend, and it threatens all parents\u2014not merely those homeschooling their children.\nMargot Cleveland is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

DreamWorks&rsquo; &ldquo;How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World&rdquo; is the latest, and it has a dumbfoundingly old-fashioned message: grow up, release your dragon, get married, and have children.</p>\n<p>In the process, it offers a profound commentary on the nature of friendship, family, and storytelling, even for those of us whose best bud isn&rsquo;t a night fury.</p>\n<p><em>(Major spoilers ahead.) </em></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hidden World&rdquo; caps off a trilogy of animated films that began in 2010, and are loosely based on Cressida Cowell&rsquo;s series of novels by the same name. It continues the story of a forbidden friendship between Hiccup, the scrawny son of a Viking chieftain, and Toothless, the last of a legendary dragon species. Their unlikely bond reverses centuries of warfare between dragons and Vikings, but invites a host of baddies looking to exploit the firepower of these mythic beasts.</p>\n<p>In &ldquo;Hidden World,&rdquo; Hiccup and Toothless have become leaders to their respective races, but find themselves facing ever more menacing foes, all bent on either dominating or destroying dragons. At last the pair realize that the only road to peace leads away from their ancestral home, into uncharted waters.</p>\n<p>The latest villain, Grimmel, doesn&rsquo;t intend to make the voyage easy for them. He wants all dragons either drugged into servitude or mounted on his wall, and he takes delight in the hunt. Complicating matters even further, love is in the air.</p>\n<h2>A Competition Between Bros and Brides</h2>\n<p>Audiences already know Hiccup&rsquo;s romantic interest, Astrid, a sharp-witted shield maiden who has been around since the first movie (although she hasn&rsquo;t quite committed to tying the knot). We get hints that her hesitation has something to do with Hiccup&rsquo;s dependence on and devotion to his dragon. He&rsquo;s not quite husband material yet, and she knows it.</p>\n<p>That devotion between Viking and dragon is tested when Toothless gets his turn to fall head-over-haunches for a rare female of his species, called a &ldquo;light fury.&rdquo; But the friends soon discover that there&rsquo;s more to this dazzling <em>femme reptile</em> than meets the eye. She&rsquo;s being used as bait to capture Toothless, and as long as he and the other dragons remain with Hiccup&rsquo;s people, their peril will only grow.</p>\n<p>Thus, the movie brings our heroes to a crossroads: Hiccup and the other Vikings must choose between keeping their dragons and releasing them into a vast and secret refuge, far from human reach. Hiccup must decide whether he loves Toothless enough to set him free&mdash;not only to a place he can find safety, but where he and his mate can start a family of their own.</p>\n<p>In the climactic battle with the bad guy, Hiccup chooses to put his friend ahead of himself, and having escaped with his life, shares what he thinks is a last goodbye with Toothless. The victorious chieftain and Astrid are (not coincidentally) married shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>As the years pass, Hiccup regales his children with stories about when dragons soared the skies with Vikings on their backs. But one day, as he sails his wife and kids into an uncharted cove, he spots a familiar nest of night-and-light furies. The wild-looking male pounces on the Vikings&rsquo; ship, apparently intent on eating them.</p>\n<p>Instead, a joyous reunion of families ensues, with introductions all around and plenty of warm fuzzies (or should I say cold scalies?). Hiccup and Toothless find that even though they have grown and built lives of their own, their friendship remains as strong as ever&mdash;and that their families can now share in it.</p>\n<h2>Endings Are Everything</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a conclusion my kids loved, and a saga finale deserving every bit of <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/how_to_train_your_dragon_the_hidden_world\">the critical acclaim it&rsquo;s receiving</a>. That&rsquo;s to say nothing of the jaw-dropping animation and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEdU_H9uYM8&list=PLnoIi4YKKKd_Xm28vG-zaNWQ82p07yf0L&index=16\">score by John Powell</a>. But this family fantasy also reminded me of a very real-world point about friendship: It&rsquo;s a type of love that doesn&rsquo;t die after stepping aside. Instead, mundane mystery that it is, friendship becomes fulfilled and glorified when it makes way for life.</p>\n<p>When my wife and I married eight years ago, I asked four of my closest friends to be my groomsmen (in addition to my brother and brother-in-law). I have since seen only one of those friends on anything like a regular basis. The rest have gone their own ways as I have gone mine, all marrying and having children. Our fellowship has broken. We mostly see each other now on social media, exchanging brief messages.</p>\n<p>For some people, this is cause for sadness. I don&rsquo;t feel that way. This natural yielding by friendship to family is something most men and women who marry will experience. Our shift in priorities is an inevitable and healthy part of growing up. We are right to focus on our spouses and little ones. It&rsquo;s their turn to embark on the adventure of life, to make friends of their own, and to write their own stories. We would be selfish to hold them back just so that we can cling to our chapters, perpetually reliving yesteryear.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s an analogy here for Hollywood, obsessed as it has become with endlessly dragged-out sagas and nostalgic sequels. Stretching a series out beyond its time is not only an act of creative betrayal, continually undermining the stakes and triumphs of each episode. It defies the very nature of a story, which is to come to an end. The &ldquo;How to Train Your Dragon&rdquo; trilogy boldly bucks this trend, bringing its heroes to maturity and then giving audiences an unapologetic &ldquo;the end.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s part of what makes it so good.</p>\n<p>Closing the book on both friendships and stories points us beyond this changing life, to something much more permanent. This is the truth that quietly passes between parting friends in a glance or a nod. I think of Disney&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Fox and the Hound&rdquo; as Todd and Copper go their separate ways, of Frodo and Sam as they bid farewell in the Grey Havens, of Alfred and Bruce&rsquo;s wordless exchange at the caf&eacute; in Florence <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTYdq4feHOo\">at the end</a> of &ldquo;The Dark Knight Rises.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>True friends know that they can afford to wait, to give each other the time and freedom to grow into the men or women they were meant to be, and especially to raise the next generation. Friendship has no timetable or biological clock. If you are religious, those occasional and wonderful reunions foreshadow a time when there will be no more goodbyes, no more obligations or parting-of-ways, no more &ldquo;the ends,&rdquo; and no more breaking of fellowships.</p>\n<p>G.

The \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d trilogy boldly bucks this trend, bringing its heroes to maturity and then giving audiences an unapologetic \u201cthe end.\u201d That\u2019s part of what makes it so good.\nClosing the book on both friendships and stories points us beyond this changing life, to something much more permanent. This is the truth that quietly passes between parting friends in a glance or a nod. I think of Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Fox and the Hound\u201d as Todd and Copper go their separate ways, of Frodo and Sam as they bid farewell in the Grey Havens, of Alfred and Bruce\u2019s wordless exchange at the caf\u00e9 in Florence at the end of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises.\u201d\nTrue friends know that they can afford to wait, to give each other the time and freedom to grow into the men or women they were meant to be, and especially to raise the next generation. Friendship has no timetable or biological clock. If you are religious, those occasional and wonderful reunions foreshadow a time when there will be no more goodbyes, no more obligations or parting-of-ways, no more \u201cthe ends,\u201d and no more breaking of fellowships.\nG.

But y&rsquo;all don&rsquo;t wanna talk about that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Madison has a point. It makes as much sense for the nightly news to cover racial violence that actually occurred in the past as it does for them to cover racial violence that hasn&rsquo;t actually occurred in the present.</p>\n<p>An editorial at Out.com already anticipated Madison&rsquo;s challenge and took it one step further. Rather than having a national discussion about lynching, they made the issue international. Their headline is a simple one: &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2019/2/19/trumps-plan-decriminalize-homosexuality-old-racist-tactic?amp&__twitter_impression=true\">Trump&rsquo;s Plan to Decriminalize Homosexuality Is an Old Racist Tactic</a>.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;Trump Derangement Syndrome&rdquo; is often used in an overly loose sense these days, to cover pretty much all opposition to the president. But while an attack on decriminalizing homosexuality on a gay website might not be deranged per se, it certainly bears further examination.</p>\n<p>The author complains that Trump&rsquo;s plan &ldquo;centers homophobic violence in Iran&rdquo; while pointing out that homosexuality &ldquo;has been illegal in Iran since the theocratic 1979 Islamic Revolution.&rdquo; What is left unmentioned is just how liberal the previous regime had been on the subject prior to the shah&rsquo;s overthrow. No less a gay icon than Andy Warhol was a frequent guest and, in his published diaries, can be read complaining about the varying portions of caviar he was served as the shah&rsquo;s fortunes waxed and waned.</p>\n<p>However, the editorial continues, &ldquo;By at least one <em><u><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/11/iran-gay-coming-out-intimate-spaces\">Guardian</a></u></em> account, since the exit of president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2013, enforcement of anti-gay laws has softened somewhat.&rdquo; While &ldquo;one Guardian account&rdquo; might be all one needs to know to offer an opinion on a given topic, the conclusion reached is close to unconscionable.</p>\n<p>Sure, the laws are on the books&mdash;but they&rsquo;re not enforced as heavily as they used to be! And yes, the legal punishment for homosexuality still includes everything up to the death penalty, but things are kinda sorta getting better for gays in Iran, which means progress, which means progressive, which means Iran is pretty much Stonewall 2019, right?</p>\n<p>Besides, &ldquo;most queer people fear homophobic reaction from fellow citizens more than the authorities.&rdquo; While I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be gay in Iran, I am fairly confident that &ldquo;private homophobic hostility is a more likely occurrence than state hostility&rdquo; is hardly as reassuring as the author would like to think.</p>\n<p>The article also fails to mention that Iran subsidizes and encourages transgenderism for gay men. In other words, the claim is that male homosexuals aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;really&rdquo; men since they are attracted to men&mdash;they are actually psychologically female, and should have the hormone treatments and gender-reassignment surgery to match. As a result of this policy, Iran competes with Thailand as the sex-change capital of the world. Besides &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/25/iran.roberttait\">one <em>Guardian</em> account</a>&rdquo; on this topic, it&rsquo;s also been covered by the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29832690\">BBC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lesterfeder/why-irans-mullahs-bless-sex-reassignment\">BuzzFeed</a>, among <a href=\"https://qz.com/889548/everyone-treated-me-like-a-saint-in-iran-theres-only-one-way-to-survive-as-a-transgender-person/\">others</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, none of this context is relevant, because President Trump is involved. What was the president&rsquo;s impetus here? As the author puts it: &ldquo;The plan has reportedly been spearheaded by the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, who is also the administration&rsquo;s top-ranked gay official, in response to news that a young gay man was hanged in Iran recently.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Perhaps the author is being pedantic. Lynchings, after all, are technically the actions of the private mob and not the state. This was a <em>hanging</em>, and we can rest assured that &ldquo;most queer people fear homophobic reaction from fellow citizens more than the authorities.&rdquo; This hanging isn&rsquo;t the norm, it&rsquo;s a one-off thing. What business is it of ours anyway? Iran is so far away.</p>\n<h2>The President Is Racist for Preventing Lynchings?</h2>\n<p>Many people support gay rights who could still be considered homophobic. Take the dad who endorses such matters as a legal principle but wouldn&rsquo;t want his daughter to be that way&mdash;or is fine with his gay son in theory but still doesn&rsquo;t want to think about what that means in practice in the bedroom. If someone fought slavery despite being a racist, however, the fact remains that he fought slavery. If someone risked herself to prevent a lynching despite personally being a racist, the fact remains that she saved a human life.</p>\n<p>As the author puts it, &ldquo;Grennell&rsquo;s attack might be a case of white men trying to save brown gay men from brown straight men.&rdquo; We have now reached the point where the president and his openly gay ambassador are being explicitly called racist for acting to <em>prevent</em> lynchings.</p>\n<p>Leaving aside the conflation of African-Americans and Persians under the fatuous umbrella of &ldquo;brown,&rdquo; the claim that white men should be exclusively or preferentially concerned with saving white gay men over brown gay men has a name: white supremacy. Yet if these same white men refrained from &ldquo;trying to save brown gay men from brown straight men,&rdquo; would that not be homophobic?</p>\n<p>This is what contemporary discourse has become. If one starts with the axiom that &ldquo;Trump = bad,&rdquo; then one can blithely claim that fighting for gay rights&mdash;up to and including preventing legal murder overseas&mdash;is an act that requires not just skepticism but outright condemnation. This is something far worse than mere derangement. This is depravity, pure and simple.</p>\n<p>Michael Malice is the subject of Harvey Pekar's &quot;Ego &amp; Hubris.&quot; He is also author of &quot;<a href=\"https://t.co/afMdiNFKbI?amp=1\">The New Right</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href=\"https://t.co/vZfTVkK6qf\">Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim Jong Il</a>,&quot; and the host of &quot;YOUR WELCOME&quot; and Night Shade.</p>\n<p>Copyright &copy; 2020 The Federalist, a wholly independent division of FDRLST Media, All Rights Reserved.</p>",

No less a gay icon than Andy Warhol was a frequent guest and, in his published diaries, can be read complaining about the varying portions of caviar he was served as the shah\u2019s fortunes waxed and waned.\nHowever, the editorial continues, \u201cBy at least one Guardian account, since the exit of president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2013, enforcement of anti-gay laws has softened somewhat.\u201d While \u201cone Guardian account\u201d might be all one needs to know to offer an opinion on a given topic, the conclusion reached is close to unconscionable.\nSure, the laws are on the books\u2014but they\u2019re not enforced as heavily as they used to be! And yes, the legal punishment for homosexuality still includes everything up to the death penalty, but things are kinda sorta getting better for gays in Iran, which means progress, which means progressive, which means Iran is pretty much Stonewall 2019, right?\nBesides, \u201cmost queer people fear homophobic reaction from fellow citizens more than the authorities.\u201d While I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be gay in Iran, I am fairly confident that \u201cprivate homophobic hostility is a more likely occurrence than state hostility\u201d is hardly as reassuring as the author would like to think.\nThe article also fails to mention that Iran subsidizes and encourages transgenderism for gay men. In other words, the claim is that male homosexuals aren\u2019t \u201creally\u201d men since they are attracted to men\u2014they are actually psychologically female, and should have the hormone treatments and gender-reassignment surgery to match. As a result of this policy, Iran competes with Thailand as the sex-change capital of the world. Besides \u201cone Guardian account\u201d on this topic, it\u2019s also been covered by the BBC and BuzzFeed, among others.\nOf course, none of this context is relevant, because President Trump is involved. What was the president\u2019s impetus here? As the author puts it: \u201cThe plan has reportedly been spearheaded by the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, who is also the administration\u2019s top-ranked gay official, in response to news that a young gay man was hanged in Iran recently.\u201d\nPerhaps the author is being pedantic. Lynchings, after all, are technically the actions of the private mob and not the state. This was a hanging, and we can rest assured that \u201cmost queer people fear homophobic reaction from fellow citizens more than the authorities.\u201d This hanging isn\u2019t the norm, it\u2019s a one-off thing. What business is it of ours anyway? Iran is so far away.\nThe President Is Racist for Preventing Lynchings?\nMany people support gay rights who could still be considered homophobic. Take the dad who endorses such matters as a legal principle but wouldn\u2019t want his daughter to be that way\u2014or is fine with his gay son in theory but still doesn\u2019t want to think about what that means in practice in the bedroom. If someone fought slavery despite being a racist, however, the fact remains that he fought slavery. If someone risked herself to prevent a lynching despite personally being a racist, the fact remains that she saved a human life.\nAs the author puts it, \u201cGrennell\u2019s attack might be a case of white men trying to save brown gay men from brown straight men.\u201d We have now reached the point where the president and his openly gay ambassador are being explicitly called racist for acting to prevent lynchings.\nLeaving aside the conflation of African-Americans and Persians under the fatuous umbrella of \u201cbrown,\u201d the claim that white men should be exclusively or preferentially concerned with saving white gay men over brown gay men has a name: white supremacy. Yet if these same white men refrained from \u201ctrying to save brown gay men from brown straight men,\u201d would that not be homophobic?\nThis is what contemporary discourse has become. If one starts with the axiom that \u201cTrump = bad,\u201d then one can blithely claim that fighting for gay rights\u2014up to and including preventing legal murder overseas\u2014is an act that requires not just skepticism but outright condemnation. This is something far worse than mere derangement. This is depravity, pure and simple.\nMichael Malice is the subject of Harvey Pekar's \"Ego & Hubris.\" He is also author of \"The New Right,\" \"Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Kim Jong Il,\" and the host of \"YOUR WELCOME\" and Night Shade.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Federalist, a wholly independent division of FDRLST Media, All Rights Reserved.",

Their service is admirable, but they hardly speak for all of us.</p>\n<p>When general and admirals speak, veterans like me tend to listen. That&rsquo;s why I perked up at a recent letter from the political gun-control group Giffords Veterans Coalition signed by 13 retired officers. That letter advised Congress that passing background checks that ban private gun sales is a moral imperative. They contend this infringement on constitutional rights is necessary to protect American safety.</p>\n<p>There are a few things the military just won&rsquo;t tolerate. Lack of discipline. Disrespect. Getting out of step. I should know&mdash;I spent 25 years instilling those values into my Marines. On this, though, I can&rsquo;t salute.</p>\n<p>These military officers claim the moral high ground in the gun debate. Their service is admirable, but they hardly speak for all of us. I&rsquo;ve been to war, and I won&rsquo;t forget those who prey on disarmed societies.</p>\n<p>I saw first-hand the aftermath of Haitian coup leader Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, who was responsible for murdering more than 3,000 people following his overthrow of a democratically elected president. I vividly remember a Shia elder in southern Iraq telling me about Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s brutality. The dictator&rsquo;s thugs dragged this man&rsquo;s three sons in front of him and executed them, just to keep them under his thumb. I&rsquo;ve seen Afghan villagers living in fear of al-Qaeda, and so much more.</p>\n<p>Law-abiding Americans must be skeptical when we&rsquo;re told to abandon our rights. We wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate military dictations on how to practice our religion. Historically, the American public has gotten outraged after the government used war as an excuse to censor the media.</p>\n<p>We should all remember that our government once used the military to force Japanese-Americans to go into <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/injustice-japanese-americans-internment-camps-resonates-strongly-180961422/\">internment camps</a> and that our Supreme Court said that was okay. This should also be true of the uniquely American right to keep and bear arms.</p>\n<p>These generals suggest that some high-profile tragedies should be a rationale for us to pass restrictive gun laws against the law-abiding. But the laws they propose wouldn&rsquo;t have stopped these murderers. Enforcing existing laws would have, if the will existed to enforce them.</p>\n<p>The murderers at a Las Vegas country music festival and the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, Calif., passed the same background checks these letter writers want Congress to expand. In Parkland, concerned citizens reported the murderer to the FBI, but it was never followed up. Police were called to the murder&rsquo;s home <a href=\"https://miami.cbslocal.com/2018/02/16/cnn-nikolas-cruz-law-enforcement-39-visits/\">39 times</a>. He allegedly <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/parkland-shooting-suspect-nikolas-cruz-allegedly-pointed-gun-at-brother-mother-report-says\">threatened</a> his mother and brother with a gun. Students <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/11/13/parkland-students-we-told-school-about-alleged-shooters-threats/\">warned</a> school officials. The laws were there. No one stepped in.</p>\n<p>In Sutherland Springs, the military <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2018/12/08/air-force-failed-six-times-keep-guns-texas-church-shooter-before-he-killed-report-finds/\">failed six times</a> to report the murderer as a prohibited individual. The Department of Defense was required to report him to the FBI. The Air Force didn&rsquo;t tell the FBI of his domestic violence court-martial conviction, involuntarily commitment to a mental health facility, and dishonorable discharge&mdash;all grounds for barring someone from possessing a gun. The murderer lied on his background check form four different times. No one knew better, because he wasn&rsquo;t reported.</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the military that fixed this. It wasn&rsquo;t Giffords Veteran Coalition. It was the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade association, that worked with Congress and got the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2135?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22s+2135%22%5D%7D&s=1&r=2\">Fix NICS Act</a> signed into law by President Trump. Now, DoD and all federal agencies are required by law to report prohibited individuals and states are provided resources to submit all criminal and adjudicated disqualifying mental health records to the FBI.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest about the other claims. The authors maintain nearly all gun owners support blanket background checks. But the NSSF presented the full facts to gun owners. Retailers at gun shows already perform these checks as required by law, and Internet sales require a face-to-face transaction with a federally licensed firearms dealer with a background check. Faced with the <a href=\"https://www.nssf.org/americans-dont-think-universal-background-checks-extension-for-gun-shows-are-needed-national-poll-finds/\">complete facts</a>, more than half of Americans polled saw new laws as unnecessary.</p>\n<p>The reality is most criminals <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/new-report-on-where-criminals-get-their-guns/\">admit</a> they get the guns they used in crimes through two primary means: theft and the black market.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear about the language the officers use in this letter. They tell us this legislation is just a first step. They want more, including outright <a href=\"https://giffords.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Giffords_GLC_assault-weapons_NFA.pdf\">bans</a> on entire classes of firearms and magazines.</p>\n<p>Retired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling even took a CNN reporter to a range to demonstrate the lethality of modern sporting rifles. He said they were weapons of war. The cringe-worthy performance, and utterances of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://taskandpurpose.com/watch-this-unintentionally-hilarious-clip-of-a-cnn-reporter-firing-an-ar-15\">full semi-automatic</a>,&rdquo; revealed his agenda.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as &ldquo;full semi-automatic.&rdquo; The truth is these rifles have been commercially available since the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/america-s-rifle-why-so-many-people-love-ar-15-n831171\">1960s</a>. The truth is the majority of criminal misuse of firearms involves stolen and black-market handguns. The truth is gun control groups will use these generals claim the moral high ground to eliminate Second Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>These officers don&rsquo;t speak for all veterans, and certainly not for those of us who treasure our rights. We spent too much time and have spilled blood to simply wash them away.</p>\n<p>Senior enlisted advisors, the salty enlisted types like me, have a special role with commanders. We offer quiet and sage counsel, the benefit of our years of experience. Generals, you&rsquo;re out of step with our freedom.</p>\n<p>Mark Oliva is director of public affairs for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade association for the firearms and ammunition industries.

                "text": "These military officers claim the moral high ground in the gun debate. Their service is admirable, but they hardly speak for all of us.\nWhen general and admirals speak, veterans like me tend to listen. That\u2019s why I perked up at a recent letter from the political gun-control group Giffords Veterans Coalition signed by 13 retired officers. That letter advised Congress that passing background checks that ban private gun sales is a moral imperative. They contend this infringement on constitutional rights is necessary to protect American safety.\nThere are a few things the military just won\u2019t tolerate. Lack of discipline. Disrespect. Getting out of step. I should know\u2014I spent 25 years instilling those values into my Marines. On this, though, I can\u2019t salute.\nThese military officers claim the moral high ground in the gun debate. Their service is admirable, but they hardly speak for all of us. I\u2019ve been to war, and I won\u2019t forget those who prey on disarmed societies.\nI saw first-hand the aftermath of Haitian coup leader Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, who was responsible for murdering more than 3,000 people following his overthrow of a democratically elected president. I vividly remember a Shia elder in southern Iraq telling me about Saddam Hussein\u2019s brutality. The dictator\u2019s thugs dragged this man\u2019s three sons in front of him and executed them, just to keep them under his thumb. I\u2019ve seen Afghan villagers living in fear of al-Qaeda, and so much more.\nLaw-abiding Americans must be skeptical when we\u2019re told to abandon our rights. We wouldn\u2019t tolerate military dictations on how to practice our religion. Historically, the American public has gotten outraged after the government used war as an excuse to censor the media.\nWe should all remember that our government once used the military to force Japanese-Americans to go into internment camps and that our Supreme Court said that was okay. This should also be true of the uniquely American right to keep and bear arms.\nThese generals suggest that some high-profile tragedies should be a rationale for us to pass restrictive gun laws against the law-abiding. But the laws they propose wouldn\u2019t have stopped these murderers. Enforcing existing laws would have, if the will existed to enforce them.\nThe murderers at a Las Vegas country music festival and the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, Calif., passed the same background checks these letter writers want Congress to expand. In Parkland, concerned citizens reported the murderer to the FBI, but it was never followed up. Police were called to the murder\u2019s home 39 times. He allegedly threatened his mother and brother with a gun. Students warned school officials. The laws were there. No one stepped in.\nIn Sutherland Springs, the military failed six times to report the murderer as a prohibited individual. The Department of Defense was required to report him to the FBI. The Air Force didn\u2019t tell the FBI of his domestic violence court-martial conviction, involuntarily commitment to a mental health facility, and dishonorable discharge\u2014all grounds for barring someone from possessing a gun. The murderer lied on his background check form four different times. No one knew better, because he wasn\u2019t reported.\nIt wasn\u2019t the military that fixed this. It wasn\u2019t Giffords Veteran Coalition. It was the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade association, that worked with Congress and got the Fix NICS Act signed into law by President Trump. Now, DoD and all federal agencies are required by law to report prohibited individuals and states are provided resources to submit all criminal and adjudicated disqualifying mental health records to the FBI.\nLet\u2019s be honest about the other claims. The authors maintain nearly all gun owners support blanket background checks. But the NSSF presented the full facts to gun owners. Retailers at gun shows already perform these checks as required by law, and Internet sales require a face-to-face transaction with a federally licensed firearms dealer with a background check. Faced with the complete facts, more than half of Americans polled saw new laws as unnecessary.\nThe reality is most criminals admit they get the guns they used in crimes through two primary means: theft and the black market.\nLet\u2019s be clear about the language the officers use in this letter. They tell us this legislation is just a first step. They want more, including outright bans on entire classes of firearms and magazines.\nRetired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling even took a CNN reporter to a range to demonstrate the lethality of modern sporting rifles. He said they were weapons of war. The cringe-worthy performance, and utterances of \u201cfull semi-automatic,\u201d revealed his agenda.\nThere\u2019s no such thing as \u201cfull semi-automatic.\u201d The truth is these rifles have been commercially available since the 1960s. The truth is the majority of criminal misuse of firearms involves stolen and black-market handguns. The truth is gun control groups will use these generals claim the moral high ground to eliminate Second Amendment rights.\nThese officers don\u2019t speak for all veterans, and certainly not for those of us who treasure our rights. We spent too much time and have spilled blood to simply wash them away.\nSenior enlisted advisors, the salty enlisted types like me, have a special role with commanders. We offer quiet and sage counsel, the benefit of our years of experience. Generals, you\u2019re out of step with our freedom.\nMark Oliva is director of public affairs for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade association for the firearms and ammunition industries. He is a retired Marine Master Gunnery Sergeant with 25 years of service, including tours in Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Albania, and Zaire.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Federalist, a wholly independent division of FDRLST Media, All Rights Reserved.",

I wish I could do it now. Twice. Or better yet, in as many jurisdictions as I can. Preferably in every swing district and every swing state.</p>\n<p>Yeah, yeah, I know &mdash; sadly, I can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s been a hell of a ride these past couple of years, and I sure hope it doesn&rsquo;t end next November.</p>\n<p>I am a middle-of-the-road Republican who voted for Trump with the utmost reluctance in 2016. He sure wasn&rsquo;t perfect. He was no Cicero, either&ndash;&ndash;though he <em>can</em> give a decent speech when the chips are down. He had a few extra skeletons rattling in his closet, especially compared to colorless non-entities like Jeb. So yeah, I was queasy about voting for an ex-registered-Democrat-from-New-York-and-possible-liberal-now-turned-Republican.</p>\n<p>Was I worried? Hell, yeah! Was I depressed? You bet. But, really, what options were there? Hillary? Jill Stein? Seriously? Trump wasn&rsquo;t my first choice or my second choice or my third choice, but by the time November 2016 rolled around, Trump was the only choice on the menu. So I swallowed hard, took a leap of faith, and pulled the lever for the Donald.</p>\n<h2>Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen Are Non-Issues For Me</h2>\n<p>And let me tell ya, every time one of these newly minted Democratic &ldquo;stars&rdquo; opens their mouth, the same thought goes through my mind: Thank God for Trump. Trump is my last line of defense. Trump is the only thing that stands between me and these hallucinogenic socialist nut jobs. Trump is what&rsquo;s keeping chaos and left-wing insanity at bay.</p>\n<p>Maybe I am not a gettable voter for the Democrats. Certainly not easily gettable, but had Trump turned out to be a closet Nelson Rockefeller, and the Democrats were to nominate a genuine centrist, who knows what could&rsquo;ve happened? Isn&rsquo;t that what politicians running for president are supposed to do&ndash;&ndash;spend a few months promoting themselves as the reasonable choice, and the other guy as unacceptable?</p>\n<p>But today, every single Democrat I can name is working overtime to make damn certain that I will pull the lever for Trump again, and with both hands this time. Trump need not worry about locking down <em>my</em> vote&ndash;&ndash;the Democrats are doing all the heavy lifting.</p>\n<p>Every time the Democrats and their media allies peddle yet another &ldquo;end of the Trump presidency bombshell,&rdquo; I laugh hysterically. If I laughed any harder, people would think I was having an epileptic seizure.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t even keep track of half the revelations that were supposed to bring Trump to an ignominious end. Even the Democrats forget most of them within days. Remember Papadopoulos? Flynn? Gates? Roger Stone? Some 77-year-old guy I&rsquo;ve never heard of, getting a handjob at a Florida massage parlor?</p>\n<p>Say what? This is a Trump scandal because apparently the former massage parlor owner posed with Trump and various Republicans who know or have spoken to Trump. Who? What? Huh? Democrats don&rsquo;t just own crazy anymore; Democrats left crazy in their rearview mirror months ago.</p>\n<p>Stormy Daniels? Right. Who gives two shits about Trump&rsquo;s sex life 12 years ago? But, but, &ldquo;Trump paid her off! It was hush money!&rdquo; you say? Yeah, okay. He probably did. Oh, hell, who are we kidding here? I am certain that he did. And I care about all this why? I can see why <em>Melania</em> would care, but why do <em>I </em>care?</p>\n<p>Heck, I&rsquo;ll go even further&ndash;&ndash;it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if Trump paid off a bunch of other women over the years. In fact, and here I am really going out on a limb, there was some reason to suspect, even before the election, that Trump hasn&rsquo;t always been a faithful husband to his various wives. But, dear Democrats: I just checked my Vanguard and Fidelity account balances, and I just don&rsquo;t give a squat about Trump&rsquo;s sex life or his ex-mistresses or how much they cost him.</p>\n<p>Michael who, you say? Michael Cohen? Oh, yeah, the sleazeball who took Trump&rsquo;s money for years and years, and then, once his taxicab schemes and assorted other shenanigans fell apart and prison time loomed, suddenly had an epiphany about Trump? The guy who plead guilty to lying to Congress? The guy who begged Trump for a pardon? <em>That</em> Michael Cohen? If Democrats think Michael Cohen&rsquo;s pathetic drooling before some congressional committee will change my mind, they are beyond delusional.</p>\n<h2>Sundry Scandals Don&rsquo;t Bother Me Either</h2>\n<p>Trump Organization, you say? Something about possible non-compliance with New York State health insurance purchasing regulations? Congress will investigate, you say? Uh huh. I am fatigued out with these investigations. You want me to vote for some Democrat because Andrew Cuomo says Trump didn&rsquo;t follow his insurance regulations? Are you people for real?</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s that? Russia? Mueller? Collusion? I am sick of Russia and I am sick of Mueller. I am sick of Comey, Rosenstein, Ohr, McCabe, Yates, Strzok, Page, Baker, and the rest of the gang. I am beyond sick of them. I am vomit-inducingly sick of them. (And, for the record, I was born in Russia, so I know Russia like these Democrat clowns can&rsquo;t even imagine.) After years of nonstop investigations, all they actually have on the collusion front is Manafort&rsquo;s tax evasion from 10 years ago. That&rsquo;s it?</p>\n<p>Remember that New York Times monster 15,000-word article about Trump&rsquo;s inheritance taxes 30 years ago? Ask me if I care. Jared Kushner? Next! Ivanka&rsquo;s shoe line? Whatever. Trump Hotel in DC? Yawn. The Emoluments Clause? Puuuuhhhhlease. Obstruction? Here, I agree. Trump made a mistake. He should have fired Comey&rsquo;s ass on day one instead of waiting two months to do it.</p>\n<p>But then, this is all yesterday&rsquo;s news. Who needs last year&rsquo;s bombshells when we have today&rsquo;s contestants! The Donkey Party has a new leader: someone called Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Every time her bright red lips form a sentence, I hear a clarion call: <em>Must Vote For Trump!</em> Unlike AOC, I actually know firsthand what socialism is. I don&rsquo;t need to imagine the future that AOC is trying to shove down my throat&ndash;&ndash;I <em>lived</em> in that future and I pray I&rsquo;ll never have to live in that future again.</p>\n<p>Every time AOC proposes to build trains to Europe, or wants butt plugs for cows to control their flatulence, or wants to spend $93 trillion on fairyland, I really, <em>really</em> want to vote for Trump. So make Ocasio-Cortez more visible! Make Ocasio-Cortez speaker of the House! Make her the keynote speaker at the convention!</p>\n<p>All the CNN talking heads agree that Trump is an idiot? Maybe, but at least he isn&rsquo;t planning to ban my car. Trump lies? Maybe, but with Trump, we&rsquo;ll still have airplanes (and my 401(k) plan has been doing great since his election).</p>\n<h2>Presidential Contenders and Congressional Nutjobs</h2>\n<p>This gets us to the next installment of &ldquo;Friday the 13th,&rdquo; a.k.a. the Democratic presidential candidates. Kamala Harris, you say? You seriously want <em>me</em> to vote for Kamala Harris? And you say that Cory &ldquo;Spartacus&rdquo; Booker is just like Kamala, only better and balder? Are you kidding me? Pete Buttigieg? Ask me again when I stop laughing.</p>\n<p>Bernie? Really? This grumpy near-octogenarian &ldquo;public service&rdquo; millionaire with three mansions is running for the presidency of the wrong country. All his best ideas have already been put into practice&ndash;&ndash;in Venezuela.</p>\n<p>This is a guy who pseudo-honeymooned in the USSR (two years before it collapsed!), and didn&rsquo;t notice that people were waiting in mile-long lines for <em>literally</em> everything. This is a guy who has never met a paleo-Stalinist dictator he couldn&rsquo;t be best pals with. Bernie doesn&rsquo;t need to pretend he is a complete crank; he <em>is</em> a complete crank.</p>\n<p>I will <em>personally</em> call every one of my friends, neighbors, and acquaintances, and beg them to vote for Trump. I will even offer to come and wash their cars while in the nude, if only they&rsquo;d vote for Trump.</p>\n<p>Did someone say Warren? Warren, the first Cherokee candidate &mdash; that Warren? Doesn&rsquo;t she now want reparations not just for African-Americans, but also for Native Americans? Where, oh where, is that lever to pull for Trump?</p>\n<p>Biden? The creepy old guy who likes to massage women and 13-year-old girls in public? That guy? I have a 19-year-old daughter, and I sure hope he never goes anywhere near her. But I do hope he runs. It feels like he&rsquo;s been running for president in every election since Eisenhower. Can he lurch far enough to the left this time, to satisfy the woke police? I doubt it, but it will be fun to watch him try.</p>\n<p>Ilhan Omar? Maybe she should run for president too. Nancy suggests that Omar is a good person who is simply too ignorant to understand what her words mean. I disagree. Omar is only saying what all the other Democrats are thinking. Yes, she is an anti-Semite. Yes, she is totally mainstream within the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>Throw that toxic Tlaib person into the mix, and we&rsquo;ve got the triumvirate that truly runs the Democratic Party now&ndash;&ndash;Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, and Tlaib. I see this nutterfest, and let me tell you, dear Democrats: I am motivated as hell. If ever given a choice (in this election or in other ones) between Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib, Pelosi, Warren, Harris, Booker, Biden, Sanders, or Trump, I will take Trump any day of the week.</p>\n<p>I am a highly motivated Trump voter because the Democrats have motivated me up to my eyeballs. I have never been more motivated in my life, because the Democrats are terrifying me. I am locked, cocked, and ready to rock in that voting booth. I just wish I didn&rsquo;t have to wait 20 months.</p>\n<p>Copyright &copy; 2020 The Federalist, a wholly independent division of FDRLST Media, All Rights Reserved.</p>",

                "text": "I am a highly motivated Trump voter because the Democrats have motivated me up to my eyeballs. I have never been more motivated in my life, because the Democrats are terrifying me.\nThis article includes rhetorical uses of profanity.\nIt\u2019s a damn shame I have to wait another 20 months to vote for President Trump. I wish I could do it now. Twice. Or better yet, in as many jurisdictions as I can. Preferably in every swing district and every swing state.\nYeah, yeah, I know \u2014 sadly, I can\u2019t. It\u2019s been a hell of a ride these past couple of years, and I sure hope it doesn\u2019t end next November.\nI am a middle-of-the-road Republican who voted for Trump with the utmost reluctance in 2016. He sure wasn\u2019t perfect. He was no Cicero, either\u2013\u2013though he can give a decent speech when the chips are down. He had a few extra skeletons rattling in his closet, especially compared to colorless non-entities like Jeb. So yeah, I was queasy about voting for an ex-registered-Democrat-from-New-York-and-possible-liberal-now-turned-Republican.\nWas I worried? Hell, yeah! Was I depressed? You bet. But, really, what options were there? Hillary? Jill Stein? Seriously? Trump wasn\u2019t my first choice or my second choice or my third choice, but by the time November 2016 rolled around, Trump was the only choice on the menu. So I swallowed hard, took a leap of faith, and pulled the lever for the Donald.\nStormy Daniels and Michael Cohen Are Non-Issues For Me\nAnd let me tell ya, every time one of these newly minted Democratic \u201cstars\u201d opens their mouth, the same thought goes through my mind: Thank God for Trump. Trump is my last line of defense. Trump is the only thing that stands between me and these hallucinogenic socialist nut jobs. Trump is what\u2019s keeping chaos and left-wing insanity at bay.\nMaybe I am not a gettable voter for the Democrats. Certainly not easily gettable, but had Trump turned out to be a closet Nelson Rockefeller, and the Democrats were to nominate a genuine centrist, who knows what could\u2019ve happened? Isn\u2019t that what politicians running for president are supposed to do\u2013\u2013spend a few months promoting themselves as the reasonable choice, and the other guy as unacceptable?\nBut today, every single Democrat I can name is working overtime to make damn certain that I will pull the lever for Trump again, and with both hands this time. Trump need not worry about locking down my vote\u2013\u2013the Democrats are doing all the heavy lifting.\nEvery time the Democrats and their media allies peddle yet another \u201cend of the Trump presidency bombshell,\u201d I laugh hysterically. If I laughed any harder, people would think I was having an epileptic seizure.\nI can\u2019t even keep track of half the revelations that were supposed to bring Trump to an ignominious end. Even the Democrats forget most of them within days. Remember Papadopoulos? Flynn? Gates? Roger Stone? Some 77-year-old guy I\u2019ve never heard of, getting a handjob at a Florida massage parlor?\nSay what? This is a Trump scandal because apparently the former massage parlor owner posed with Trump and various Republicans who know or have spoken to Trump. Who? What? Huh? Democrats don\u2019t just own crazy anymore; Democrats left crazy in their rearview mirror months ago.\nStormy Daniels? Right. Who gives two shits about Trump\u2019s sex life 12 years ago? But, but, \u201cTrump paid her off! It was hush money!\u201d you say? Yeah, okay. He probably did. Oh, hell, who are we kidding here? I am certain that he did. And I care about all this why? I can see why Melania would care, but why do I care?\nHeck, I\u2019ll go even further\u2013\u2013it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Trump paid off a bunch of other women over the years. In fact, and here I am really going out on a limb, there was some reason to suspect, even before the election, that Trump hasn\u2019t always been a faithful husband to his various wives. But, dear Democrats: I just checked my Vanguard and Fidelity account balances, and I just don\u2019t give a squat about Trump\u2019s sex life or his ex-mistresses or how much they cost him.\nMichael who, you say? Michael Cohen? Oh, yeah, the sleazeball who took Trump\u2019s money for years and years, and then, once his taxicab schemes and assorted other shenanigans fell apart and prison time loomed, suddenly had an epiphany about Trump? The guy who plead guilty to lying to Congress? The guy who begged Trump for a pardon? That Michael Cohen? If Democrats think Michael Cohen\u2019s pathetic drooling before some congressional committee will change my mind, they are beyond delusional.\nSundry Scandals Don\u2019t Bother Me Either\nTrump Organization, you say? Something about possible non-compliance with New York State health insurance purchasing regulations? Congress will investigate, you say? Uh huh. I am fatigued out with these investigations. You want me to vote for some Democrat because Andrew Cuomo says Trump didn\u2019t follow his insurance regulations? Are you people for real?\nWhat\u2019s that? Russia? Mueller? Collusion? I am sick of Russia and I am sick of Mueller. I am sick of Comey, Rosenstein, Ohr, McCabe, Yates, Strzok, Page, Baker, and the rest of the gang. I am beyond sick of them. I am vomit-inducingly sick of them. (And, for the record, I was born in Russia, so I know Russia like these Democrat clowns can\u2019t even imagine.) After years of nonstop investigations, all they actually have on the collusion front is Manafort\u2019s tax evasion from 10 years ago. That\u2019s it?\nRemember that New York Times monster 15,000-word article about Trump\u2019s inheritance taxes 30 years ago? Ask me if I care. Jared Kushner? Next! Ivanka\u2019s shoe line? Whatever. Trump Hotel in DC? Yawn. The Emoluments Clause? Puuuuhhhhlease. Obstruction? Here, I agree. Trump made a mistake. He should have fired Comey\u2019s ass on day one instead of waiting two months to do it.\nBut then, this is all yesterday\u2019s news. Who needs last year\u2019s bombshells when we have today\u2019s contestants! The Donkey Party has a new leader: someone called Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Every time her bright red lips form a sentence, I hear a clarion call: Must Vote For Trump! Unlike AOC, I actually know firsthand what socialism is. I don\u2019t need to imagine the future that AOC is trying to shove down my throat\u2013\u2013I lived in that future and I pray I\u2019ll never have to live in that future again.\nEvery time AOC proposes to build trains to Europe, or wants butt plugs for cows to control their flatulence, or wants to spend $93 trillion on fairyland, I really, really want to vote for Trump. So make Ocasio-Cortez more visible! Make Ocasio-Cortez speaker of the House! Make her the keynote speaker at the convention!\nAll the CNN talking heads agree that Trump is an idiot? Maybe, but at least he isn\u2019t planning to ban my car. Trump lies? Maybe, but with Trump, we\u2019ll still have airplanes (and my 401(k) plan has been doing great since his election).\nPresidential Contenders and Congressional Nutjobs\nThis gets us to the next installment of \u201cFriday the 13th,\u201d a.k.a. the Democratic presidential candidates. Kamala Harris, you say? You seriously want me to vote for Kamala Harris? And you say that Cory \u201cSpartacus\u201d Booker is just like Kamala, only better and balder? Are you kidding me? Pete Buttigieg? Ask me again when I stop laughing.\nBernie? Really? This grumpy near-octogenarian \u201cpublic service\u201d millionaire with three mansions is running for the presidency of the wrong country. All his best ideas have already been put into practice\u2013\u2013in Venezuela.\nThis is a guy who pseudo-honeymooned in the USSR (two years before it collapsed!), and didn\u2019t notice that people were waiting in mile-long lines for literally everything. This is a guy who has never met a paleo-Stalinist dictator he couldn\u2019t be best pals with. Bernie doesn\u2019t need to pretend he is a complete crank; he is a complete crank.\nI will personally call every one of my friends, neighbors, and acquaintances, and beg them to vote for Trump. I will even offer to come and wash their cars while in the nude, if only they\u2019d vote for Trump.\nDid someone say Warren? Warren, the first Cherokee candidate \u2014 that Warren? Doesn\u2019t she now want reparations not just for African-Americans, but also for Native Americans? Where, oh where, is that lever to pull for Trump?\nBiden? The creepy old guy who likes to massage women and 13-year-old girls in public? That guy? I have a 19-year-old daughter, and I sure hope he never goes anywhere near her. But I do hope he runs. It feels like he\u2019s been running for president in every election since Eisenhower. Can he lurch far enough to the left this time, to satisfy the woke police? I doubt it, but it will be fun to watch him try.\nIlhan Omar? Maybe she should run for president too. Nancy suggests that Omar is a good person who is simply too ignorant to understand what her words mean. I disagree. Omar is only saying what all the other Democrats are thinking. Yes, she is an anti-Semite. Yes, she is totally mainstream within the Democratic Party.\nThrow that toxic Tlaib person into the mix, and we\u2019ve got the triumvirate that truly runs the Democratic Party now\u2013\u2013Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, and Tlaib. I see this nutterfest, and let me tell you, dear Democrats: I am motivated as hell. If ever given a choice (in this election or in other ones) between Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib, Pelosi, Warren, Harris, Booker, Biden, Sanders, or Trump, I will take Trump any day of the week.\nI am a highly motivated Trump voter because the Democrats have motivated me up to my eyeballs. I have never been more motivated in my life, because the Democrats are terrifying me. I am locked, cocked, and ready to rock in that voting booth. I just wish I didn\u2019t have to wait 20 months.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Federalist, a wholly independent division of FDRLST Media, All Rights Reserved.",

Some Americans, unfortunately, immediately used the bloodbath to support their political causes.</p>\n<p>Sen. Chris Murphy wondered, for instance, why Americans needed &ldquo;semi-automatic rifles,&rdquo; at all. &ldquo;Nobody needs an AR-15 to hunt,&rdquo; the Connecticut senator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1107049416970649600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweeted</a>. &ldquo;Nobody needs a semi-automatic rifle to defend their home. But mass shooters NEED these weapons in order to murder as many people as efficiently as possible. And so nobody will miss them when they are illegal &ndash; except for the killers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>One of the nice things about having individual rights codified in a Constitution is that Americans don&rsquo;t (or shouldn&rsquo;t) have to explain to government officials why they choose to practice them. I&rsquo;m certain nothing in the Second Amendment mentions hunting, because the right of self-defense&mdash;an individual concern, as well as a collective one&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t about shooting deer, it was about protecting Americans from the state confiscating their firearms.</p>\n<p>While Murphy&rsquo;s reductionist take is obviously wrong on several counts, it&rsquo;s exceptionally wrong in claiming that killers would miss these rifles. Killers will always have weapons. And they don&rsquo;t need AR-15s, even though there are probably between 10 and 15 million of them in circulation in the US. And unless Murphy believes federal agents should be tasked with going house to house and confiscating every &ldquo;semi-automatic rifle&rdquo;&mdash;an unlikely scenario&mdash;they will be with us a very long time.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/First-Freedom-Through-Americas-Enduring/dp/1501174002/\"><img alt=\"\" data-lazy-src=\"https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/81qKuX6YM6L.jpg\" data-portal-copyright=\"The Federalist\" sizes=\"(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px\" src=\"https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/81qKuX6YM6L.jpg\" srcset=\"https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/81qKuX6YM6L.jpg 1399w, https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/81qKuX6YM6L-199x300.jpg 199w, https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/81qKuX6YM6L-768x1161.jpg 768w, https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/81qKuX6YM6L-678x1024.jpg 678w, https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/81qKuX6YM6L-179x270.jpg 179w, https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/81qKuX6YM6L-998x1508.jpg 998w, https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/81qKuX6YM6L-132x200.jpg 132w, https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/81qKuX6YM6L-142x214.jpg 142w\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>Nor is there evidence that banning the AR-15 would reduce criminality or mass shootings, anyway. The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (1994 to 2004) did nothing to alter gun violence trends. Once the assault weapon was lifted, and the AR-15 became the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/america-s-rifle-why-so-many-people-love-ar-15-n831171\">most popular rifle in the country</a>, gun violence continue to precipitously fall.</p>\n<p>Considering the political hysteria around crime, and the slight uptick in crime in 2017, many Americans might not be aware that every category of violent crime <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-1\">has fallen to historic lows</a> over the past 25 years. And while every school shooting is a distressing event, inflicting deep pain on individuals, communities, and the nation, it&rsquo;s important to point out that despite the proliferation of the AR-15, schools are much safer today than they were 20 years ago&mdash;<a href=\"https://news.northeastern.edu/2018/02/26/schools-are-still-one-of-the-safest-places-for-children-researcher-says/\">even school shootings are less common</a>, according to researchers at Northeastern. Four times as many children were killed in schools in the early &rsquo;90s than today.</p>\n<p>Then again, AR-15s are rarely used in the crimes, in general. If you need any more proof that the AR is being singled out for political reasons, mostly due to its aesthetics, it&rsquo;s worth noting that in 2017, the <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-4.xls\">last year of FBI data</a>, there were 7,105 Americans murdered by handguns and 374 by all rifles (only a fraction of which were AR-15s.) There were 1,604 knife homicides during that same span.

I just don&rsquo;t think that we need to sell any more weapons of war into this public.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There are two major problems with these talking points.</p>\n<p>One: No matter how many times gun-controllers refer to the AR-15 as a &ldquo;weapon of war&rdquo; it will still be historically and mechanically incorrect. Writers like James Fallows <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2017/11/why-the-ar-15-was-never-meant-to-be-in-civilians-hands/545438/\">have, for years,</a> been misleading readers about the history of the AR-15, purposely conflating it with the military M-16. Eugene Stoner, chief engineer of ArmaLite and its parent company Colt, marketed the AR (&ldquo;ArmaLite Rifle&rdquo;) directly to <a href=\"https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2016/06/21/potd-sporting-colt-ar-15-ad/\">the civilian marketplace</a> in the early 1960s&mdash;before its more powerful version was adopted by the US military.</p>\n<p>Of course, every gun from the musket, to the rifle, to the revolver, to the semi-automatic handgun was once used as, or developed into, a &ldquo;weapon of war.&rdquo; In the end, every gun is designed to kill, otherwise it would be worthless. And if any weapon that kills can be categorized as a &ldquo;weapon of war&rdquo; then the AR will have some stiff competition. John Browning designed the 1911 handgun before World War I, and it was subsequently used by the US military until 1986. Now it is one of the most popular handgun designs in the country. It was a &ldquo;weapon of war.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And every great gunmaker in American history sought government contracts as a way to maximize profits. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean the civilian and military versions of the AR are the same. Americans like AR-15s for a variety of reasons, include ease of use, but the civilian iteration was never used as a &ldquo;weapon of war.&rdquo; The major difference is that the AR-15 fires once every trigger pull, like any other semi-automatic weapon on the market. In fact, it uses smaller ammunition than most semi-automatic guns. The M-16 (and M-4)&ndash;actual weapons of war&ndash;can be fully automatic or used in three-round bursts. The AR-15, in fact, can be considered <em>less</em> a weapon of war when Stoner sold it to civilians (until 1977 when the patent ran out) than many other legal guns of the time. Fully automatic firearms were only effectively banned in 1986.</p>\n<p>Two: Using the phrase &ldquo;weapon of war&rdquo; is just a pretext. The <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em> <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf\">decision</a> found that the Second Amendment protected weapons &ldquo;in common use by law-abiding citizens.&rdquo; The AR-15 clearly meets this criteria. Scarborough invents an exceptionally narrow definition of Heller, in which he argues that the decision basically only protects handguns for the purpose of home protection, and, I guess, bolt-action hunting rifles. But this is clearly untrue. The <em>Heller</em> decision found that the Second Amendment was an individual right to keep and bear arms for any &ldquo;lawful purpose,&rdquo; not merely home protection (or hunting). It found that the Second Amendment &ldquo;guarantee[s] the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gun restrictionists focus on the AR-15 because it looks like a military weapon. Once stripped of emotion, however, the argument against ARs, which feature the same mechanics as many others firearms, is that they work better. There will always be a gun that works better than other guns. The focus on the AR is merely part of an incremental push towards broader prohibitions. After all, many gun controllers openly argue that we should roll back technology to musket&mdash;also a weapon of war&mdash;because the founders never imagined firearms would become more powerful. This is historically inaccurate, as well. But when politicians go back to writing pamphlets rather than making their cases on TV and the internet, we can start to have that conversation.</p>",

                "text": "Efforts to outlaw the AR-15 are part of an incremental movement to ban all semi-automatic guns\n\u201cThis conflict over the 2nd amendment and the attempted removal of firearms rights will ultimately result in a civil war that will eventually balkanize the US along political, cultural and, most importantly, racial lines,\u201d wrote the Christchurch, New Zealand mass murderer in his demented manifesto. Some Americans, unfortunately, immediately used the bloodbath to support their political causes.\nSen. Chris Murphy wondered, for instance, why Americans needed \u201csemi-automatic rifles,\u201d at all. \u201cNobody needs an AR-15 to hunt,\u201d the Connecticut senator tweeted. \u201cNobody needs a semi-automatic rifle to defend their home. But mass shooters NEED these weapons in order to murder as many people as efficiently as possible. And so nobody will miss them when they are illegal \u2013 except for the killers.\u201d\nOne of the nice things about having individual rights codified in a Constitution is that Americans don\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) have to explain to government officials why they choose to practice them. I\u2019m certain nothing in the Second Amendment mentions hunting, because the right of self-defense\u2014an individual concern, as well as a collective one\u2014wasn\u2019t about shooting deer, it was about protecting Americans from the state confiscating their firearms.\nWhile Murphy\u2019s reductionist take is obviously wrong on several counts, it\u2019s exceptionally wrong in claiming that killers would miss these rifles. Killers will always have weapons. And they don\u2019t need AR-15s, even though there are probably between 10 and 15 million of them in circulation in the US. And unless Murphy believes federal agents should be tasked with going house to house and confiscating every \u201csemi-automatic rifle\u201d\u2014an unlikely scenario\u2014they will be with us a very long time.\nNor is there evidence that banning the AR-15 would reduce criminality or mass shootings, anyway. The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (1994 to 2004) did nothing to alter gun violence trends. Once the assault weapon was lifted, and the AR-15 became the most popular rifle in the country, gun violence continue to precipitously fall.\nConsidering the political hysteria around crime, and the slight uptick in crime in 2017, many Americans might not be aware that every category of violent crime has fallen to historic lows over the past 25 years. And while every school shooting is a distressing event, inflicting deep pain on individuals, communities, and the nation, it\u2019s important to point out that despite the proliferation of the AR-15, schools are much safer today than they were 20 years ago\u2014even school shootings are less common, according to researchers at Northeastern. Four times as many children were killed in schools in the early \u201990s than today.\nThen again, AR-15s are rarely used in the crimes, in general. If you need any more proof that the AR is being singled out for political reasons, mostly due to its aesthetics, it\u2019s worth noting that in 2017, the last year of FBI data, there were 7,105 Americans murdered by handguns and 374 by all rifles (only a fraction of which were AR-15s.) There were 1,604 knife homicides during that same span. There were 656 people killed by fists and kicking.\n\u201cFact checkers\u201d like to point out that not every national police department reports on the type of gun is used in homicides (3,077 to be exact), but it\u2019s reasonable to believe that the same trends would apply to those crimes. It\u2019s mostly big cities that don\u2019t share information on the types of guns criminals use.\nThere\u2019s a good reason that gun controllers want to depict the AR as uniquely dangerous. \u201cAs a longtime gun owner and supporter of the Second Amendment, I agreed with the Supreme Court\u2019s \u2018Heller\u2019 holding that concluded Americans had the right to keep and bear arms. But that constitutional protection did not, and will not, extend to guns designed as weapons of war,\u201d explained Joe Scarborough in a Twitter thread.\n\u201cIf you own an AR-15, keep it,\u201d the gracious presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke told the American people the other day, \u201cContinue to use it responsibly and safely. I just don\u2019t think that we need to sell any more weapons of war into this public.\u201d\nThere are two major problems with these talking points.\nOne: No matter how many times gun-controllers refer to the AR-15 as a \u201cweapon of war\u201d it will still be historically and mechanically incorrect. Writers like James Fallows have, for years, been misleading readers about the history of the AR-15, purposely conflating it with the military M-16. Eugene Stoner, chief engineer of ArmaLite and its parent company Colt, marketed the AR (\u201cArmaLite Rifle\u201d) directly to the civilian marketplace in the early 1960s\u2014before its more powerful version was adopted by the US military.\nOf course, every gun from the musket, to the rifle, to the revolver, to the semi-automatic handgun was once used as, or developed into, a \u201cweapon of war.\u201d In the end, every gun is designed to kill, otherwise it would be worthless. And if any weapon that kills can be categorized as a \u201cweapon of war\u201d then the AR will have some stiff competition.

But that doesn\u2019t mean the civilian and military versions of the AR are the same.

The AR-15, in fact, can be considered less a weapon of war when Stoner sold it to civilians (until 1977 when the patent ran out) than many other legal guns of the time. Fully automatic firearms were only effectively banned in 1986.\nTwo: Using the phrase \u201cweapon of war\u201d is just a pretext. The District of Columbia v. Heller decision found that the Second Amendment protected weapons \u201cin common use by law-abiding citizens.\u201d The AR-15 clearly meets this criteria. Scarborough invents an exceptionally narrow definition of Heller, in which he argues that the decision basically only protects handguns for the purpose of home protection, and, I guess, bolt-action hunting rifles. But this is clearly untrue. The Heller decision found that the Second Amendment was an individual right to keep and bear arms for any \u201clawful purpose,\u201d not merely home protection (or hunting). It found that the Second Amendment \u201cguarantee[s] the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.\u201d\nGun restrictionists focus on the AR-15 because it looks like a military weapon. Once stripped of emotion, however, the argument against ARs, which feature the same mechanics as many others firearms, is that they work better. There will always be a gun that works better than other guns. The focus on the AR is merely part of an incremental push towards broader prohibitions. After all, many gun controllers openly argue that we should roll back technology to musket\u2014also a weapon of war\u2014because the founders never imagined firearms would become more powerful. This is historically inaccurate, as well. But when politicians go back to writing pamphlets rather than making their cases on TV and the internet, we can start to have that conversation.",

It has not, however, announced it will end the program that featured the male sex offender dressed up as a woman reading LGBT books to children as young as babies.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A media spokesperson for the library confirmed one of the program&rsquo;s drag queens, Tatiana Mala Nina, is Alberto Garza, a 32-year-old child sex offender,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/houston-public-library-admits-registered-child-sex-offender-read-to-kids-in-drag-queen-storytime/285-becf3a0d-56c5-4f3c-96df-add07bbd002a\">reports local TV station KHOU</a>. &ldquo;In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/SexOffenderRegistry/Search/Rapsheet?Sid=08184646\">State records say</a> the 200-pound, 5-foot-11 man was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child, is at a &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; risk for reoffending, and must report his whereabouts to police annually for the rest of his life. Garza&rsquo;s YouTube channel showed he was in the process of transgendering himself, <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/pederast-story-hour-houston-drag-queen/\">according to Rod Dreher</a> (videos since removed; screenshot of Garza in drag captured <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-15-at-10.40.21-PM-554x548.png\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>Drag Queen Storytime is spreading to libraries across the country, mostly but not exclusively in deeply Democratic locales.

Child molesters are known for &ldquo;grooming&rdquo; potential victims, including by getting them used to ignoring worries and warnings from their consciences, confusing them about what is normal, and accepting increasingly transgressive behavior.</p>\n<p>Here are some snaps from the Drag Queen Storytime Instagram page.

These platitudes have already been used to turn off the good judgment of the people who should be protecting children from potential harm, such as parents and librarians.</p>\n<h2>Five-Year-Olds Shouldn&rsquo;t Be Learning About Anal Sex</h2>\n<p>Part of the problem is that it&rsquo;s impossible to explain to a young child what &ldquo;gay&rdquo; or &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; is without also exposing her to concepts that are not appropriate for pre-pubescent children. It&rsquo;s not true, for example, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30T7k46WQ-0&feature=youtu.be\">as the YouTube channel Queer Kids Stuff explains</a>, that being gay just means: &ldquo;When one person of one gender loves someone romantically who is the same gender. So, if a boy loves a boy, they&rsquo;re gay. And if a girl loves a girl, they&rsquo;re gay too. What if a person loves a person? They&rsquo;re gay too.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As everyone with any life experience knows, the vast majority of friendships among people of the same sex include no sexual activity or attraction. Women routinely love female relatives deeply with no sexuality involved, and the same is true for men. Emotional closeness does not suffice to define homosexuality, and telling kids it does risks teaching the falsehood that their childish affection for their best friend or father means they&rsquo;re gay.</p>\n<p>Gay people don&rsquo;t look alike, act alike, have similar genetics or other biological characteristics, live exclusively near each other, or do (or be) any other thing that exclusively defines them as gay except for the type of sex they engage in. And prepubescent children simply are too young to be thinking about sex in the kind of specificity and detail required to explain that to them accurately.</p>\n<p>They don&rsquo;t need to know about oral or anal sex. They don&rsquo;t need to know about men cutting off their penises and women cutting off their breasts to look more like the opposite sex. They shouldn&rsquo;t be told damaging lies about how girls can have a boy&rsquo;s body.</p>\n<p>Until puberty, humans do not have biological sexual urges, and until that tandem physical and emotional maturation process begins, typically in middle school, it damages children&rsquo;s moral, mental, and emotional development to expose them to these kinds of things. Some of these things should <em>never</em> be exposed or done to children, regardless of where they are in their sexual maturation.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"> <p>7. Lungs &quot;never fully inflate.&quot; Must use ventolin pump. <a href=\"https://t.co/BXUfGJRya5\">pic.twitter.com/BXUfGJRya5</a></p> </blockquote>\n<p>Early sexual exposure leads to <a href=\"https://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF12D43.pdf\">many harms and risks</a>, such as <a href=\"https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2017/12/apo-nid127771-1154061.pdf\">earlier and riskier sexual activity</a> and <a href=\"https://protectyoungminds.org/2016/04/28/can-5-minutes-protect-kids-sexual-abuse/\">vulnerability to predators</a>. Showing pornography is an extreme example (that child predators also use), but on the danger spectrum is also the sexualization of our culture that typically feminists complain about. Little girls wearing booty shorts, taking children to movies with sex scenes, and tween boys demanding sexts are a part of this emotional brutalization, this dulling of conscience and eradication of innocence.</p>\n<p>A sane culture would work to reduce children&rsquo;s exposure to adult material. In a sane culture, it would not take an actual child molester leading Drag Queen Storytime to make people question the idea of such an event.</p>\n<h2>Queering the Curriculum Is a Thing That&rsquo;s Happening</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not solely storytimes grooming children for sexual confusion, either, it&rsquo;s also sex ed curricula in many schools. Because 2013&rsquo;s Supreme Court decision <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em> forcibly instituted genderless marriages into the nation&rsquo;s legal regime, public schools are now legally bound to teach about gay sex in sex ed. That trickle-down is hitting blue and purple states and cities first, but it&rsquo;s going to eventually be everywhere because the law demands treating gay and heterosexual sex as the same.</p>\n<p>In Colorado, what that means is <a href=\"https://townhall.com/columnists/joyoverbeck/2019/03/07/comprehensive-sex-ed-is-leading-to-kids-gender-confusion-n2542742\">legislators drafting a mandate</a> for &ldquo;comprehensive sex ed&rdquo; curriculum for all children in public schools ages 4-12. Four. Age four. What could four-year-olds be learning under this pending law? Well, the bill would mandate that children learn about &ldquo;the relational or sexual experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender individuals,&rdquo; and &ldquo;gender, gender expression, gender identity&rdquo; &mdash; i.e., transgenderism. California and New York already have instituted such curricula in their public schools.</p>\n<p>Many schools don&rsquo;t need a mandate, however. Last November, a Colorado elementary school herded children from kindergarten through fifth grade into their auditorium to watch videos from the above-quoted Queer Kids Stuff YouTube channel. Accompanying <a href=\"https://itgetsbetter.org/lesson/queer-kid-stuff/\">lesson plans</a> ask kids to write down what &ldquo;gay&rdquo; means after having watched the video explaining &ldquo;gay&rdquo; can mean &ldquo;When a person loves a person.&rdquo; If that&rsquo;s the definition, we&rsquo;re all gay. And if we&rsquo;re all gay, gay doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, and there&rsquo;d be no need to teach it to four-year-olds.</p>\n<p>Another lesson plan for another video asks kids to define &ldquo;Bisexual&rdquo; as &ldquo;When a boy or girl loves other boys and girls,&rdquo; and shows kids pictures of celebrities who label themselves bisexual. A later lesson tells kids to mark &ldquo;False&rdquo; at the statement &ldquo;Doctors are always right when they say a new baby is a boy or girl.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Schools also don&rsquo;t need a sex ed class to teach children about adult sex topics starting at age four. Activists are working to embed LGBT material across classes. Just one example is A Queer Endeavor, a project of two education professors at the University of Colorado at Bolder that has taught <a href=\"https://townhall.com/columnists/joyoverbeck/2019/03/07/comprehensive-sex-ed-is-leading-to-kids-gender-confusion-n2542742\">about 5,000 teachers</a> so far <a href=\"http://aqueerendeavor.org/\">how to</a> &ldquo;integrate topics of gender and sexual diversity across program areas and teacher-preparation coursework.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>From Queering Classrooms to Queering Culture</h2>\n<p>One wonders whether there is any connection between queering classrooms and libraries and documented spikes in transgenderism among children, in both the United States and United Kingdom. Sociologist Mark Regnerus <a href=\"https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/12/queering-science\">observes at First Things</a>, &ldquo;What had once comprised around 0.3 percent of the population as recently as 2011 has vaulted to 0.6 percent by 2016, with adolescent transgender self-identification comprising 0.7 percent. But a new study in Pediatrics, leaning on a statewide survey in Minnesota, revealed a figure just under 3 percent, four times as large as the Williams estimate. In other words, the adolescent transgender population has grown extraordinarily quickly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A recent Brown University study found that <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2018/08/31/explosive-ivy-league-study-repressed-for-finding-transgender-kids-may-be-a-social-contagion/\">teens were more likely to identify</a> as transgender if their peers and school culture were anti-heterosexual and heavy on identity politics. A cynic would wonder whether this is partially the point of these high-pressure social and legal campaigns.</p>\n<p>Given that transgender identification is also related to trauma &mdash; about half the kids in the study who quickly identified as transgender had recently experienced significant emotional trauma, and of course it&rsquo;s traumatic to cut off one&rsquo;s healthy body parts and <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/yes-they-are-coming-for-kids-transgender/\">obsess over dildos in elementary school</a> &mdash; this further reinforces the conclusion queering schools and storytimes doesn&rsquo;t need to involve actual child molesters to pose a clear threat to children.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"> <p>Another thriving Etsy storefront, TransPackingUniverse, sells handmade fabric prosthetic penises &quot;Silly Willies&quot; for very small children.<a href=\"https://t.co/K17ODWFDFl\">https://t.co/K17ODWFDFl</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/SY4IJVc3zA\">pic.twitter.com/SY4IJVc3zA</a></p> <p>&mdash; 4thWaveNow (@4th_WaveNow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/4th_WaveNow/status/1106900388731674625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 16, 2019</a></p></blockquote>",

                "text": "This article contains information and images not fit for children.\nThe Houston Public Library has apologized for featuring a convicted child molester last fall during its \u201cDrag Queen Storytime\u201d series. It has not, however, announced it will end the program that featured the male sex offender dressed up as a woman reading LGBT books to children as young as babies.\n\u201cA media spokesperson for the library confirmed one of the program\u2019s drag queens, Tatiana Mala Nina, is Alberto Garza, a 32-year-old child sex offender,\u201d reports local TV station KHOU. \u201cIn 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.\u201d\nState records say the 200-pound, 5-foot-11 man was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child, is at a \u201cmoderate\u201d risk for reoffending, and must report his whereabouts to police annually for the rest of his life. Garza\u2019s YouTube channel showed he was in the process of transgendering himself, according to Rod Dreher (videos since removed; screenshot of Garza in drag captured here).\nDrag Queen Storytime is spreading to libraries across the country, mostly but not exclusively in deeply Democratic locales. It even has a national PR webpage featuring an image of a scared toddler staring at a man dressed up in drag while the child\u2019s mother encourages the child to get over the apprehension.\nNotice that this is the exact opposite of what sexual assault prevention programs teach people to do: pay attention to and act on their feelings of discomfort, rather than overrule them. Child molesters are known for \u201cgrooming\u201d potential victims, including by getting them used to ignoring worries and warnings from their consciences, confusing them about what is normal, and accepting increasingly transgressive behavior.\nHere are some snaps from the Drag Queen Storytime Instagram page. Determine for yourself whether what they depict might fit into the category of grooming.\nIf you\u2019re looking at this with a fair mind, it\u2019s pretty easy to see that LGBT platitudes about \u201clove\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d could malform children\u2019s developing understanding of safe and appropriate sexual behavior. These platitudes have already been used to turn off the good judgment of the people who should be protecting children from potential harm, such as parents and librarians.\nFive-Year-Olds Shouldn\u2019t Be Learning About Anal Sex\nPart of the problem is that it\u2019s impossible to explain to a young child what \u201cgay\u201d or \u201ctransgender\u201d is without also exposing her to concepts that are not appropriate for pre-pubescent children. It\u2019s not true, for example, as the YouTube channel Queer Kids Stuff explains, that being gay just means: \u201cWhen one person of one gender loves someone romantically who is the same gender. So, if a boy loves a boy, they\u2019re gay. And if a girl loves a girl, they\u2019re gay too. What if a person loves a person? They\u2019re gay too.\u201d\nAs everyone with any life experience knows, the vast majority of friendships among people of the same sex include no sexual activity or attraction. Women routinely love female relatives deeply with no sexuality involved, and the same is true for men. Emotional closeness does not suffice to define homosexuality, and telling kids it does risks teaching the falsehood that their childish affection for their best friend or father means they\u2019re gay.\nGay people don\u2019t look alike, act alike, have similar genetics or other biological characteristics, live exclusively near each other, or do (or be) any other thing that exclusively defines them as gay except for the type of sex they engage in. And prepubescent children simply are too young to be thinking about sex in the kind of specificity and detail required to explain that to them accurately.\nThey don\u2019t need to know about oral or anal sex. They don\u2019t need to know about men cutting off their penises and women cutting off their breasts to look more like the opposite sex. They shouldn\u2019t be told damaging lies about how girls can have a boy\u2019s body.\nUntil puberty, humans do not have biological sexual urges, and until that tandem physical and emotional maturation process begins, typically in middle school, it damages children\u2019s moral, mental, and emotional development to expose them to these kinds of things. Some of these things should never be exposed or done to children, regardless of where they are in their sexual maturation.\n7. Lungs \"never fully inflate.\" Must use ventolin pump. pic.twitter.com/BXUfGJRya5\nEarly sexual exposure leads to many harms and risks, such as earlier and riskier sexual activity and vulnerability to predators. Showing pornography is an extreme example (that child predators also use), but on the danger spectrum is also the sexualization of our culture that typically feminists complain about. Little girls wearing booty shorts, taking children to movies with sex scenes, and tween boys demanding sexts are a part of this emotional brutalization, this dulling of conscience and eradication of innocence.\nA sane culture would work to reduce children\u2019s exposure to adult material. In a sane culture, it would not take an actual child molester leading Drag Queen Storytime to make people question the idea of such an event.\nQueering the Curriculum Is a Thing That\u2019s Happening\nIt\u2019s not solely storytimes grooming children for sexual confusion, either, it\u2019s also sex ed curricula in many schools. Because 2013\u2019s Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges forcibly instituted genderless marriages into the nation\u2019s legal regime, public schools are now legally bound to teach about gay sex in sex ed. That trickle-down is hitting blue and purple states and cities first, but it\u2019s going to eventually be everywhere because the law demands treating gay and heterosexual sex as the same.\nIn Colorado, what that means is legislators drafting a mandate for \u201ccomprehensive sex ed\u201d curriculum for all children in public schools ages 4-12. Four. Age four. What could four-year-olds be learning under this pending law? Well, the bill would mandate that children learn about \u201cthe relational or sexual experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender individuals,\u201d and \u201cgender, gender expression, gender identity\u201d \u2014 i.e., transgenderism. California and New York already have instituted such curricula in their public schools.\nMany schools don\u2019t need a mandate, however. Last November, a Colorado elementary school herded children from kindergarten through fifth grade into their auditorium to watch videos from the above-quoted Queer Kids Stuff YouTube channel. Accompanying lesson plans ask kids to write down what \u201cgay\u201d means after having watched the video explaining \u201cgay\u201d can mean \u201cWhen a person loves a person.\u201d If that\u2019s the definition, we\u2019re all gay. And if we\u2019re all gay, gay doesn\u2019t mean anything, and there\u2019d be no need to teach it to four-year-olds.\nAnother lesson plan for another video asks kids to define \u201cBisexual\u201d as \u201cWhen a boy or girl loves other boys and girls,\u201d and shows kids pictures of celebrities who label themselves bisexual. A later lesson tells kids to mark \u201cFalse\u201d at the statement \u201cDoctors are always right when they say a new baby is a boy or girl.\u201d\nSchools also don\u2019t need a sex ed class to teach children about adult sex topics starting at age four. Activists are working to embed LGBT material across classes. Just one example is A Queer Endeavor, a project of two education professors at the University of Colorado at Bolder that has taught about 5,000 teachers so far how to \u201cintegrate topics of gender and sexual diversity across program areas and teacher-preparation coursework.\u201d\nFrom Queering Classrooms to Queering Culture\nOne wonders whether there is any connection between queering classrooms and libraries and documented spikes in transgenderism among children, in both the United States and United Kingdom. Sociologist Mark Regnerus observes at First Things, \u201cWhat had once comprised around 0.3 percent of the population as recently as 2011 has vaulted to 0.6 percent by 2016, with adolescent transgender self-identification comprising 0.7 percent. But a new study in Pediatrics, leaning on a statewide survey in Minnesota, revealed a figure just under 3 percent, four times as large as the Williams estimate. In other words, the adolescent transgender population has grown extraordinarily quickly.\u201d\nA recent Brown University study found that teens were more likely to identify as transgender if their peers and school culture were anti-heterosexual and heavy on identity politics. A cynic would wonder whether this is partially the point of these high-pressure social and legal campaigns.\nGiven that transgender identification is also related to trauma \u2014 about half the kids in the study who quickly identified as transgender had recently experienced significant emotional trauma, and of course it\u2019s traumatic to cut off one\u2019s healthy body parts and obsess over dildos in elementary school \u2014 this further reinforces the conclusion queering schools and storytimes doesn\u2019t need to involve actual child molesters to pose a clear threat to children.\nAnother thriving Etsy storefront, TransPackingUniverse, sells handmade fabric prosthetic penises \"Silly Willies\" for very small children.https://t.co/K17ODWFDFl pic.twitter.com/SY4IJVc3zA\n\u2014 4thWaveNow (@4th_WaveNow) March 16, 2019",

During the day-long questioning, Strzok sought to explain away the more deleterious text messages he sent to his mistress and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page.</p>\n<p>When one considers Strzok&rsquo;s explanation of his reference to an &ldquo;insurance policy&rdquo; in light of Page&rsquo;s testimony, which Collins also released last week, and other previously known facts, there seem to be only two possibilities: Strzok was lying or an unknown spy was targeting the Trump campaign.</p>\n<p>Strzok sent the &ldquo;insurance policy&rdquo; text to Page on August 15, 2016, just two weeks after the FBI&rsquo;s launch of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation of the Trump campaign: &ldquo;I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy&rsquo;s office&mdash;that there&rsquo;s no way he gets elected&mdash;but I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t take that risk. It&rsquo;s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you&rsquo;re 40,&rdquo; the former deputy assistant director wrote to Page.</p>\n<h2>Strzok&rsquo;s Answer</h2>\n<p>When questioned on the meaning of this text by members of the House Judiciary Committee, Strzok testified that &ldquo;we had received information from a very sensitive source alleging collusion between the Government of Russia and members of the Trump campaign.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As is frequently the case in counterintelligence investigations and any national security investigations,&rdquo; Strzok added, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a tension between the protection of a sensitive source and method of pursuing the investigation related to that information.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So my use of the phrase &lsquo;insurance policy&rsquo; was simply to say,&rdquo; Strzok continued, that &ldquo;while the polls or people might think it is less likely that then-candidate Trump would be elected, that should not influence&mdash;that should not get in the way of us doing our job responsibly to protect the national security.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For backdrop, Strzok then stressed, there was a debate swirling internally concerning &ldquo;how aggressively to pursue investigation, given that aggressive pursuit might put that intelligence source at risk.&rdquo; But since polls overwhelmingly favored Hillary Clinton, some in the FBI (presumably Page) believed &ldquo;we cannot risk this source by just not really investigating that aggressively.&rdquo; Strzok noted that he disagreed with that perspective, believing that the FBI needed to investigate because, if Trump won, individuals colluding with Russia might be named to senior national security positions.</p>\n<p>Page similarly testified that upon opening Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI staff had a number of discussions about how to balance the need to ensure the Russians had not co-opted an individual associated with the Trump presidential campaign and the desire not to approach the investigation at a breakneck speed and potentially burn sources. Page explained she took the view that, because Trump was unlikely to be elected, there was not the same threat to national security, thus a more cautious approach made more sense.</p>\n<p>While Page and Strzok&rsquo;s explanations lined up in the main, Strzok&rsquo;s testimony added one significant detail. He spoke of having already &ldquo;received information from a very sensitive source alleging collusion alleging collusion between the Government of Russia and members of the Trump campaign.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Strzok sent the &ldquo;insurance policy&rdquo; text on August 15, 2016, merely two weeks after the official launch of Crossfire Hurricane. And the FBI has claimed it initiated the Russia probe when it received information that the Trump campaign had foreknowledge of the WikiLeaks possession of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails. That information came, however, not from &ldquo;a very sensitive source,&rdquo; but <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/05/27/downer-papadopoulos-trump/\">from</a> an Australian diplomat named Alexander Downer.</p>\n<h2>What &lsquo;Sensitive Source&rsquo; Did He Mean?</h2>\n<p>Trump campaign volunteer advisor George Papadopoulos had told Downer in May 2016, over drinks in a London bar, that the Russians had damaging information on Hillary Clinton. After WikiLeaks released the DNC emails, Joe Hockey, Australia&rsquo;s ambassador to the United States, relayed Downer&rsquo;s information to the FBI (in late July 2016).</p>\n<p>Former British spy and &ldquo;dossier&rdquo; author Christopher Steele also would not qualify as &ldquo;a very sensitive source,&rdquo; for many reasons. First, the FBI has maintained that Steele&rsquo;s reporting had nothing to do with the launch of the investigation into the Trump campaign. Second, the FBI has long claimed that it did not receive Steele&rsquo;s &ldquo;intel&rdquo; at FBI headquarters until mid-September.</p>\n<p>Third, Steele&rsquo;s identity as a former MI6 agent is well-known, already making it impossible for him to travel to Russia or otherwise act covertly. Finally, Steele had no problem outing himself to several media outlets when spreading the details of his dossier.</p>\n<p>Page&rsquo;s testimony further negates any possibility that Steele was the &ldquo;very sensitive source&rdquo; the FBI wanted to protect. Page claimed that, as of August 2016, she did not know who Steele was. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that he&rsquo;s an FBI source. I don&rsquo;t know what he does. I have never heard of him in all my life,&rdquo; Page testified. She continued: &ldquo;When the FBI first receives the reports that are known as the dossier from an FBI agent who is Christopher Steele&rsquo;s handler in September of 2016, at that time, we do not know who&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know why these reports are generated. We don&rsquo;t know for what purpose.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So, if the FBI didn&rsquo;t know who Steele was in August 2016, he couldn&rsquo;t have been &ldquo;a very sensitive source,&rdquo; for that reason as well.</p>\n<p>Page&rsquo;s testimony creates yet a bigger problem: Her statement contradicts Department of Justice lawyer Bruce Ohr&rsquo;s testimony to the House committee. Ohr testified that in early August, after meeting with Steele on July 30, 2016, he met with Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page and informed them of Steele&rsquo;s intel.</p>\n<p>Yet Page claims they did not learn of Steele&rsquo;s reports until Steele&rsquo;s handler provided them in September of 2016.

                "text": "And Lisa Page\u2019s testimony creates yet a bigger problem since her statement contradicts DOJ lawyer Bruce Ohr\u2019s testimony to the House committee.\nLast Thursday, Doug Collins, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, released the committee\u2019s transcript of its interview of disgraced former FBI agent Peter Strzok. During the day-long questioning, Strzok sought to explain away the more deleterious text messages he sent to his mistress and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page.\nWhen one considers Strzok\u2019s explanation of his reference to an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d in light of Page\u2019s testimony, which Collins also released last week, and other previously known facts, there seem to be only two possibilities: Strzok was lying or an unknown spy was targeting the Trump campaign.\nStrzok sent the \u201cinsurance policy\u201d text to Page on August 15, 2016, just two weeks after the FBI\u2019s launch of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation of the Trump campaign: \u201cI want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy\u2019s office\u2014that there\u2019s no way he gets elected\u2014but I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t take that risk. It\u2019s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you\u2019re 40,\u201d the former deputy assistant director wrote to Page.\nStrzok\u2019s Answer\nWhen questioned on the meaning of this text by members of the House Judiciary Committee, Strzok testified that \u201cwe had received information from a very sensitive source alleging collusion between the Government of Russia and members of the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\u201cAs is frequently the case in counterintelligence investigations and any national security investigations,\u201d Strzok added, \u201cthere\u2019s a tension between the protection of a sensitive source and method of pursuing the investigation related to that information.\u201d\n\u201cSo my use of the phrase \u2018insurance policy\u2019 was simply to say,\u201d Strzok continued, that \u201cwhile the polls or people might think it is less likely that then-candidate Trump would be elected, that should not influence\u2014that should not get in the way of us doing our job responsibly to protect the national security.\u201d\nFor backdrop, Strzok then stressed, there was a debate swirling internally concerning \u201chow aggressively to pursue investigation, given that aggressive pursuit might put that intelligence source at risk.\u201d But since polls overwhelmingly favored Hillary Clinton, some in the FBI (presumably Page) believed \u201cwe cannot risk this source by just not really investigating that aggressively.\u201d Strzok noted that he disagreed with that perspective, believing that the FBI needed to investigate because, if Trump won, individuals colluding with Russia might be named to senior national security positions.\nPage similarly testified that upon opening Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI staff had a number of discussions about how to balance the need to ensure the Russians had not co-opted an individual associated with the Trump presidential campaign and the desire not to approach the investigation at a breakneck speed and potentially burn sources. Page explained she took the view that, because Trump was unlikely to be elected, there was not the same threat to national security, thus a more cautious approach made more sense.\nWhile Page and Strzok\u2019s explanations lined up in the main, Strzok\u2019s testimony added one significant detail. He spoke of having already \u201creceived information from a very sensitive source alleging collusion alleging collusion between the Government of Russia and members of the Trump campaign.\u201d\nBut Strzok sent the \u201cinsurance policy\u201d text on August 15, 2016, merely two weeks after the official launch of Crossfire Hurricane. And the FBI has claimed it initiated the Russia probe when it received information that the Trump campaign had foreknowledge of the WikiLeaks possession of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails. That information came, however, not from \u201ca very sensitive source,\u201d but from an Australian diplomat named Alexander Downer.\nWhat \u2018Sensitive Source\u2019 Did He Mean?\nTrump campaign volunteer advisor George Papadopoulos had told Downer in May 2016, over drinks in a London bar, that the Russians had damaging information on Hillary Clinton. After WikiLeaks released the DNC emails, Joe Hockey, Australia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, relayed Downer\u2019s information to the FBI (in late July 2016).\nFormer British spy and \u201cdossier\u201d author Christopher Steele also would not qualify as \u201ca very sensitive source,\u201d for many reasons. First, the FBI has maintained that Steele\u2019s reporting had nothing to do with the launch of the investigation into the Trump campaign. Second, the FBI has long claimed that it did not receive Steele\u2019s \u201cintel\u201d at FBI headquarters until mid-September.\nThird, Steele\u2019s identity as a former MI6 agent is well-known, already making it impossible for him to travel to Russia or otherwise act covertly. Finally, Steele had no problem outing himself to several media outlets when spreading the details of his dossier.\nPage\u2019s testimony further negates any possibility that Steele was the \u201cvery sensitive source\u201d the FBI wanted to protect. Page claimed that, as of August 2016, she did not know who Steele was. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s an FBI source. I don\u2019t know what he does. I have never heard of him in all my life,\u201d Page testified. She continued: \u201cWhen the FBI first receives the reports that are known as the dossier from an FBI agent who is Christopher Steele\u2019s handler in September of 2016, at that time, we do not know who\u2014we don\u2019t know why these reports are generated. We don\u2019t know for what purpose.\u201d\nSo, if the FBI didn\u2019t know who Steele was in August 2016, he couldn\u2019t have been \u201ca very sensitive source,\u201d for that reason as well.\nPage\u2019s testimony creates yet a bigger problem: Her statement contradicts Department of Justice lawyer Bruce Ohr\u2019s testimony to the House committee. Ohr testified that in early August, after meeting with Steele on July 30, 2016, he met with Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page and informed them of Steele\u2019s intel.\nYet Page claims they did not learn of Steele\u2019s reports until Steele\u2019s handler provided them in September of 2016. Even then, Page claims she did not know why the reports were generated, again contradicting Ohr\u2019s assertion that when he provided information from Steele to the FBI he made clear \u201cThese guys were hired by somebody relating to\u2014who\u2019s related to the Clinton campaign.\u201d\nMight there have been a \u201cvery sensitive source\u201d involved, as Strzok maintained? Maybe. But surely it wasn\u2019t Stefan Halper either, because the FBI would never, ever leak details so descriptive of a \u201cvery sensitive source\u201d that the general public could identify him from the New York Times and Washington Post\u2019s reporting \u2014 right? Or if Strzok did mean Halper, that in itself is troubling, because it means the FBI was willing to burn a \u201cvery sensitive source\u201d to damage Trump.\nOf course, we already know that Halper was in place and targeting Trump campaign-connected Carter Page before the official launch of Crossfire Hurricane\u2014also disturbing to those concerned about the FBI\u2019s targeting of a political opponent.\nIf it was not Halper, was there \u201ca very sensitive source\u201d in place on August 15, 2016? If so, that would bring to two the number of sources in place at a time that Page testified was \u201cliterally the very beginning\u201d of the evidence when there was \u201ca paucity of evidence.\u201d Yet, with very little evidence, the FBI had sources spying on the Trump campaign. Who those sources were remains to be seen, as does the question of how Page and Ohr\u2019s testimony can be reconciled.",

Many will cherry-pick information to support their current opposition to the president. Here's what is reasonable to expect from it.</p>\n<p>Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s report is expected to be made public early this week. The big special counsel news already occurred last month when Attorney General William Barr announced Mueller ended his investigation without a single American &mdash; much less a single American tied to President Donald Trump &mdash; being indicted for collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>The news followed years of media coverage claiming Trump was an agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin and had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton. That conspiracy theory led first to widespread spying on the Trump campaign using overseas intelligence assets and a variety of electronic surveillance.</p>\n<p>Following Trump&rsquo;s election, weaponized leaks from intelligence officials ramped up. Eventually it led to a no-holds-barred and no-expense-spared special counsel investigation of Trump and his campaign affiliates. The lack of indictments for the ostensible reason for the investigation was profoundly deflating &mdash; and embarrassing &mdash; for the Resistance and its media leaders.</p>\n<p>Relatively few people will read the nearly 400-page special counsel report. Many will cherry-pick information to support their current opposition to the president. Here&rsquo;s what is reasonable to expect from it.</p>\n<h2>Part 1: No Indictments For Russia Collusion</h2>\n<p>The report is divided into two parts. The first part is about Russia&rsquo;s efforts to meddle in the 2016 elections. Mueller already indicted a bunch of mostly Russians as part of his investigation, although it is unlikely they&rsquo;ll ever be tried or convicted of their alleged crimes. But Mueller did not find that anyone in the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to steal the election. As <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/24/us/politics/barr-letter-mueller-report.html\">Barr put it in his summary</a> of Mueller&rsquo;s conclusions, &ldquo;The Special Counsel&rsquo;s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a diehard Mueller fan or a <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2018/04/19/revealed-robert-muellers-fbi-repeatedly-abused-prosecutorial-discretion/\">skeptic</a>, few would suggest Mueller would have declined to indict anyone for Russia collusion if he had the goods on them. He already announced there were no more indictments coming out of his investigation. He did his best to squeeze anyone who might even possibly have information on collusion with Russia &mdash; including a sea of somewhat sketchy Americans who were in the Trump orbit &mdash; and came up empty.</p>\n<p>Given how much attention has been paid to and blame has been given to Russian meddling, Americans may reasonably wonder why there weren&rsquo;t many more Russians indicted for election antics, or even simply more meddling ascribed to Russians. Not that Facebook memes, Twitter trolls, and email hacks are nothing, but Americans may have expected much more expense and effort expended by Russians given how much the media blamed them for Clinton&rsquo;s loss.</p>\n<p>Either way: the collusion theory that was used to undermine the administration of the duly elected president and justify breaking every norm against him resulted in not a single indictment against an American for colluding with Russia.</p>\n<h2>Part 2: No Indictments for Obstruction</h2>\n<p>The second part of the report is about &ldquo;obstruction of justice.&rdquo; While the Mueller probe was sold to the American public using the Trump-Russia Collusion Conspiracy Theory, it was always actually about obstruction. That was partly because FBI investigators knew at the time of the special counsel&rsquo;s launch that &mdash; in the words of disgraced chief investigator Peter Strzok &mdash; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbis-strzok-allegedly-dismissed-mueller-probe-no-big-there-there\">there&rsquo;s no big there there</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When Comey leaked his memos to spur the launch of a special counsel, there was nothing meaningful about Russia collusion in them but he had written them &mdash; and later testified about them &mdash; so as to suggest that Trump&rsquo;s frustration with FBI game-playing was really an attempt to obstruct law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Recently, some of the involved actors at the Department of Justice and FBI leaked to friendly media that unelected bureaucrats <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/14/nyt-reveals-fbi-retaliated-against-trump-for-comey-firing/\">started the probe out of revenge</a> for Comey&rsquo;s firing, to oppose Trump&rsquo;s foreign policy, and because Trump had signaled to the American public that the FBI was playing games about whether he was under investigation. It perhaps needs to be said that it is the president, not unelected bureaucrats, who sets foreign policy, makes hiring and firing decisions, and oversees the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>It didn&rsquo;t take recent leaks to know this was an obstruction investigation. That news leaked &mdash; even though we&rsquo;re always told that the special counsel&rsquo;s team never leaked &mdash; by June 14, 2017. Four friendly reporters at the Washington Post, including Devlin Barrett, Adam Entous, and Ellen Nakashima, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/special-counsel-is-investigating-trump-for-possible-obstruction-of-justice/2017/06/14/9ce02506-5131-11e7-b064-828ba60fbb98_story.html\">received that leak</a> and wrote it up in typical &ldquo;bombshell&rdquo; fashion:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia&rsquo;s role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said.</p> <p>The move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump&rsquo;s conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates, officials said.</p> <p>Trump had received private assurances from then-FBI Director James B. Comey starting in January that he was not personally under investigation. Officials say that changed shortly after Comey&rsquo;s firing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Even though the leaks were frequently about obstruction, the focus remained on Russia for a few reasons &mdash; and not just because intelligence officials kept selectively leaking information about Russia to make it appear that there was a grand Trump-Russia conspiracy. Supporters of the president found the &ldquo;obstruction&rdquo; theories ridiculous. Opponents of the president kind of did, too.</p>\n<p>They were promised by a sea of elites that Trump was a traitor who had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. They weren&rsquo;t going to settle for the idea that Donald Trump, of all people, could be brought down by highlighting his angry tweets or other complaints about being accused of being a Russian agent.</p>\n<p>Deputy Attorney General Rod  appointing Mueller special counsel said nothing of obstruction. It charged Mueller with investigating &ldquo;any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump&rdquo; and &ldquo;any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4429989-Rod-Rosenstein-memo-outlining-scope-of-Mueller.html\">highly redacted subsequent memo changed the mandate</a>. If obstruction is part of that August 2, 2017, mandate, it was hidden from the American people. Even congressional committees seeking to perform oversight of the Department of Justice were kept in the dark about the mandate and whether it was appropriate or inappropriate.</p>\n<h2>Spinning and Hyping Obstruction</h2>\n<p>Barr is a highly respected attorney who served as President George H. W. Bush&rsquo;s attorney general in the early 1990s. Now in his sixties, he&rsquo;s back for another tour. His summary of conclusions from the special counsel report suggested a bit of frustration with the approach Mueller took.</p>\n<p>While a private citizen, Barr wrote a memo about Mueller&rsquo;s alleged obstruction theory and sent it to the Department of Justice. He wrote his memo based on public reporting that Mueller was attempting to go after Trump for constitutional and lawful firing decisions. Barr rightly thought that was a horrible idea that would damage both the Department of Justice and the presidency. (Read <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2018/12/20/william-barr-right-making-comeys-firing-crime-will-destroy-doj/\">my article on the memo from December</a> for more information.)</p>\n<p>Barr also reportedly believes it&rsquo;s improper for law enforcement officials to smear someone when announcing he is not being indicted for a crime. The inspector general&rsquo;s report on the FBI&rsquo;s investigation of Hillary Clinton supported Rosenstein&rsquo;s criticism of Comey for smearing Clinton when Comey announced he was letting her go.</p>\n<p>Barr spoke volumes in his summary when he noted that &ldquo;The Special Counsel states that &lsquo;while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.'&rdquo; This line was Comey-like. Indeed, Mueller and Comey&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2017/live-updates/trump-white-house/trump-comey-and-russia-how-key-washington-players-are-reacting/brothers-in-arms-the-long-friendship-between-mueller-and-comey/\">long friendship</a>&rdquo; was described by the Washington Post in May 2017 as &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2017/live-updates/trump-white-house/trump-comey-and-russia-how-key-washington-players-are-reacting/brothers-in-arms-the-long-friendship-between-mueller-and-comey/\">brothers in arms</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Nearly everyone in the media ignored this rather dramatic conflict of interest. Comey and Mueller frequently worked together when Comey was deputy attorney general and Mueller was FBI director. Carl Cannon wrote about some of their <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/05/21/when_comey_and_mueller_bungled_the_anthrax_case_133953.html\">shared failures and misjudgments</a>, including the notoriously botched anthrax case and their conniving during the Bush administration.</p>\n<p>Americans are innocent until proven guilty. While it is the task of the special counsel to decide whether a crime occurred or whether to indict someone for a crime, it is not his job to &ldquo;exonerate&rdquo; someone. The language was a bit cute.</p>\n<p>Barr, who seems to be one of the few adults in the District of Columbia, followed up Mueller&rsquo;s little quote about exoneration by writing, &ldquo;The Special Counsel&rsquo;s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He and Rosenstein went through the report, consulted with department officials, applied the principles of federal prosecution that guide decisions about whether to charge someone with a crime, and &ldquo;concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel&rsquo;s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>They went out of their way to say this wasn&rsquo;t because he was a president, and it wasn&rsquo;t even just because there was no actual collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election, but because Mueller had failed to show the things that would be necessarily proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish a crime had been conducted. Those things they&rsquo;d have to prove are that Trump tweeted and engaged in other actions with &ldquo;corrupt intent,&rdquo; and that the obstruction had a sufficient connection to a &ldquo;pending or contemplating proceeding.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Critics of the president hope to move past those problems and focus on the nearly 400 pages cataloging the worst-case construction on President Trump&rsquo;s angry tweets and other attempts to win the day against the now-debunked Russia conspiracy theory that was undermining his administration daily.</p>\n<p>The never-leaky special counsel team leaked to both the New York Times and Washington Post that they were incensed that Barr had gotten to &ldquo;set the narrative&rdquo; by summarizing the report&rsquo;s conclusions instead of letting them set the impeachment-for-obstruction narrative. &ldquo;Limited information Barr has shared about Russia investigation frustrated some on Mueller&rsquo;s team,&rdquo; was the Post&rsquo;s headline. The New York Times went with, &ldquo;Some on Mueller&rsquo;s Team Say Report Was More Damaging Than Barr revealed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While Mueller refused to indict Trump and Barr already noted that most of the alleged obstruction actions have been the subject of public reporting &mdash; including everything from tweets to failed attempts to get White House Counsel Don McGahn to order Mueller&rsquo;s firing &mdash; seeing them all listed one after another is something, again, one might expect of Mueller&rsquo;s close friend and ally Comey.</p>\n<p>The special counsel was imagined as an &ldquo;insurance policy&rdquo; to help undermine the administration of the Department of Justice and possibly impeachment. This report will seek to accomplish that goal, even with no indictments. Expect the media to spin and hype whatever they can out of the report, as per usual.</p>\n<p>Mollie Ziegler Hemingway is a senior editor at The Federalist.

                "text": "Relatively few people will read the nearly 400-page special counsel report. Many will cherry-pick information to support their current opposition to the president. Here's what is reasonable to expect from it.\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report is expected to be made public early this week. The big special counsel news already occurred last month when Attorney General William Barr announced Mueller ended his investigation without a single American \u2014 much less a single American tied to President Donald Trump \u2014 being indicted for collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election.\nThe news followed years of media coverage claiming Trump was an agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin and had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton. That conspiracy theory led first to widespread spying on the Trump campaign using overseas intelligence assets and a variety of electronic surveillance.\nFollowing Trump\u2019s election, weaponized leaks from intelligence officials ramped up. Eventually it led to a no-holds-barred and no-expense-spared special counsel investigation of Trump and his campaign affiliates. The lack of indictments for the ostensible reason for the investigation was profoundly deflating \u2014 and embarrassing \u2014 for the Resistance and its media leaders.\nRelatively few people will read the nearly 400-page special counsel report. Many will cherry-pick information to support their current opposition to the president. Here\u2019s what is reasonable to expect from it.\nPart 1: No Indictments For Russia Collusion\nThe report is divided into two parts. The first part is about Russia\u2019s efforts to meddle in the 2016 elections. Mueller already indicted a bunch of mostly Russians as part of his investigation, although it is unlikely they\u2019ll ever be tried or convicted of their alleged crimes. But Mueller did not find that anyone in the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to steal the election. As Barr put it in his summary of Mueller\u2019s conclusions, \u201cThe Special Counsel\u2019s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\u201d\nWhether you\u2019re a diehard Mueller fan or a skeptic, few would suggest Mueller would have declined to indict anyone for Russia collusion if he had the goods on them. He already announced there were no more indictments coming out of his investigation. He did his best to squeeze anyone who might even possibly have information on collusion with Russia \u2014 including a sea of somewhat sketchy Americans who were in the Trump orbit \u2014 and came up empty.\nGiven how much attention has been paid to and blame has been given to Russian meddling, Americans may reasonably wonder why there weren\u2019t many more Russians indicted for election antics, or even simply more meddling ascribed to Russians. Not that Facebook memes, Twitter trolls, and email hacks are nothing, but Americans may have expected much more expense and effort expended by Russians given how much the media blamed them for Clinton\u2019s loss.\nEither way: the collusion theory that was used to undermine the administration of the duly elected president and justify breaking every norm against him resulted in not a single indictment against an American for colluding with Russia.\nPart 2: No Indictments for Obstruction\nThe second part of the report is about \u201cobstruction of justice.\u201d While the Mueller probe was sold to the American public using the Trump-Russia Collusion Conspiracy Theory, it was always actually about obstruction. That was partly because FBI investigators knew at the time of the special counsel\u2019s launch that \u2014 in the words of disgraced chief investigator Peter Strzok \u2014 \u201cthere\u2019s no big there there.\u201d\nWhen Comey leaked his memos to spur the launch of a special counsel, there was nothing meaningful about Russia collusion in them but he had written them \u2014 and later testified about them \u2014 so as to suggest that Trump\u2019s frustration with FBI game-playing was really an attempt to obstruct law enforcement.\nRecently, some of the involved actors at the Department of Justice and FBI leaked to friendly media that unelected bureaucrats started the probe out of revenge for Comey\u2019s firing, to oppose Trump\u2019s foreign policy, and because Trump had signaled to the American public that the FBI was playing games about whether he was under investigation. It perhaps needs to be said that it is the president, not unelected bureaucrats, who sets foreign policy, makes hiring and firing decisions, and oversees the Department of Justice.\nIt didn\u2019t take recent leaks to know this was an obstruction investigation. That news leaked \u2014 even though we\u2019re always told that the special counsel\u2019s team never leaked \u2014 by June 14, 2017. Four friendly reporters at the Washington Post, including Devlin Barrett, Adam Entous, and Ellen Nakashima, received that leak and wrote it up in typical \u201cbombshell\u201d fashion:\nThe special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said.\nThe move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump\u2019s conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates, officials said.\nTrump had received private assurances from then-FBI Director James B. Comey starting in January that he was not personally under investigation. Officials say that changed shortly after Comey\u2019s firing.\nEven though the leaks were frequently about obstruction, the focus remained on Russia for a few reasons \u2014 and not just because intelligence officials kept selectively leaking information about Russia to make it appear that there was a grand Trump-Russia conspiracy. Supporters of the president found the \u201cobstruction\u201d theories ridiculous. Opponents of the president kind of did, too.\nThey were promised by a sea of elites that Trump was a traitor who had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. They weren\u2019t going to settle for the idea that Donald Trump, of all people, could be brought down by highlighting his angry tweets or other complaints about being accused of being a Russian agent.\nDeputy Attorney General Rod appointing Mueller special counsel said nothing of obstruction. It charged Mueller with investigating \u201cany links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cany matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\u201d\nA highly redacted subsequent memo changed the mandate. If obstruction is part of that August 2, 2017, mandate, it was hidden from the American people. Even congressional committees seeking to perform oversight of the Department of Justice were kept in the dark about the mandate and whether it was appropriate or inappropriate.\nSpinning and Hyping Obstruction\nBarr is a highly respected attorney who served as President George H. W. Bush\u2019s attorney general in the early 1990s. Now in his sixties, he\u2019s back for another tour. His summary of conclusions from the special counsel report suggested a bit of frustration with the approach Mueller took.\nWhile a private citizen, Barr wrote a memo about Mueller\u2019s alleged obstruction theory and sent it to the Department of Justice. He wrote his memo based on public reporting that Mueller was attempting to go after Trump for constitutional and lawful firing decisions. Barr rightly thought that was a horrible idea that would damage both the Department of Justice and the presidency. (Read my article on the memo from December for more information.)\nBarr also reportedly believes it\u2019s improper for law enforcement officials to smear someone when announcing he is not being indicted for a crime. The inspector general\u2019s report on the FBI\u2019s investigation of Hillary Clinton supported Rosenstein\u2019s criticism of Comey for smearing Clinton when Comey announced he was letting her go.\nBarr spoke volumes in his summary when he noted that \u201cThe Special Counsel states that \u2018while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.'\u201d This line was Comey-like. Indeed, Mueller and Comey\u2019s \u201clong friendship\u201d was described by the Washington Post in May 2017 as \u201cbrothers in arms.\u201d\nNearly everyone in the media ignored this rather dramatic conflict of interest. Comey and Mueller frequently worked together when Comey was deputy attorney general and Mueller was FBI director. Carl Cannon wrote about some of their shared failures and misjudgments, including the notoriously botched anthrax case and their conniving during the Bush administration.\nAmericans are innocent until proven guilty. While it is the task of the special counsel to decide whether a crime occurred or whether to indict someone for a crime, it is not his job to \u201cexonerate\u201d someone. The language was a bit cute.\nBarr, who seems to be one of the few adults in the District of Columbia, followed up Mueller\u2019s little quote about exoneration by writing, \u201cThe Special Counsel\u2019s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.\u201d\nHe and Rosenstein went through the report, consulted with department officials, applied the principles of federal prosecution that guide decisions about whether to charge someone with a crime, and \u201cconcluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\u201d\nThey went out of their way to say this wasn\u2019t because he was a president, and it wasn\u2019t even just because there was no actual collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election, but because Mueller had failed to show the things that would be necessarily proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish a crime had been conducted. Those things they\u2019d have to prove are that Trump tweeted and engaged in other actions with \u201ccorrupt intent,\u201d and that the obstruction had a sufficient connection to a \u201cpending or contemplating proceeding.\u201d\nCritics of the president hope to move past those problems and focus on the nearly 400 pages cataloging the worst-case construction on President Trump\u2019s angry tweets and other attempts to win the day against the now-debunked Russia conspiracy theory that was undermining his administration daily.\nThe never-leaky special counsel team leaked to both the New York Times and Washington Post that they were incensed that Barr had gotten to \u201cset the narrative\u201d by summarizing the report\u2019s conclusions instead of letting them set the impeachment-for-obstruction narrative. \u201cLimited information Barr has shared about Russia investigation frustrated some on Mueller\u2019s team,\u201d was the Post\u2019s headline. The New York Times went with, \u201cSome on Mueller\u2019s Team Say Report Was More Damaging Than Barr revealed.\u201d\nWhile Mueller refused to indict Trump and Barr already noted that most of the alleged obstruction actions have been the subject of public reporting \u2014 including everything from tweets to failed attempts to get White House Counsel Don McGahn to order Mueller\u2019s firing \u2014 seeing them all listed one after another is something, again, one might expect of Mueller\u2019s close friend and ally Comey.\nThe special counsel was imagined as an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d to help undermine the administration of the Department of Justice and possibly impeachment. This report will seek to accomplish that goal, even with no indictments. Expect the media to spin and hype whatever they can out of the report, as per usual.\nMollie Ziegler Hemingway is a senior editor at The Federalist.

Of course, the feel-good, inevitably government-expanding presidential contender should probably have been more hesitant to release his returns because it doesn&rsquo;t take much sleuthing to figure out from them that the O&rsquo;Rourkes made $370,412 in 2017 while giving a measly $1,166 of that income to charity. As The Post noted, this makes Beto&rsquo;s charitable giving less than one-third of 1 percent of his household income.</p>\n<p>Other candidates who claim conservatives are the true greedy ones and deserve to be smited for their fiscal sins don&rsquo;t stack up much better. Bernie Sanders and his wife gave roughly 3 percent of their astonishingly large $566,000 income to charity in 2017. Interestingly, Sanders recently talked about his impressive sum of book earnings, and Reason&rsquo;s Peter Suderman <a href=\"https://reason.com/2019/04/15/bernie-sanders-is-a-millionaire-thats-great/\">pointed out</a> that the socialist is indeed a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/us/politics/bernie-sanders-millionaire-net-worth-taxes.html\">millionaire</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think it&rsquo;s genuinely great that Bernie Sanders is a millionaire, and that in becoming a millionaire, our nation&rsquo;s most well-known democratic socialist politician has, however inadvertently, started defending one of the core tenets of capitalism&mdash;that if you come up with an idea for a product, make that product a reality in the world, and sell it to lots of willing buyers, it&rsquo;s perfectly just and reasonable for you to earn a lot of money as a result.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He&rsquo;s exactly right. None of these impressively wealthy Democratic presidential contenders should be scorned for making heaps, providing it&rsquo;s from creating value that people want to benefit from.</p>\n<p>Kamala Harris (and her husband) made nearly $2 million in 2018, giving 1.4 percent to charity (which totals out to about $27,000); Elizabeth Warren (and her husband) made just shy of $1 million (donating an improved 5.5 percent to charity in 2018). They should, however, be thoroughly criticized for demonizing millionaires and billionaires, branding them the no good, very bad, super icky ultra-wealthy, when they are some of the wealthiest people in America.</p>\n<p>Of course, many super-wealthy people don&rsquo;t think of themselves that way. A <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/most-americans-who-earn-90000-a-year-say-they-dont-consider-themselves-rich-2019-01-24\">YouGov poll</a> from earlier this year found that almost 90 percent of respondents who make $90,000 or more annually consider themselves neither rich nor poor. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with abundance, but it is odd that people would be not more self-aware about where they stand compared to the groups many routinely demonize.</p>\n<p>Charitable giving should transcend political affiliation. It would be bad for our broader societal health if generosity were grossly weaponized to score political points, because then giving becomes more of a manipulative political ploy than it already is (to recipients, the intention behind giving probably doesn&rsquo;t make a difference).</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s something to be said for giving credit where due and recognizing when our political opponents do genuine good. Still, Arthur Brooks wrote on broader charitable giving habits in his 2015 book &ldquo;The Conservative Heart,&rdquo; noting:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Households headed by a &lsquo;conservative&rsquo; give, on average, 30 percent more dollars to charity than households headed by a &lsquo;liberal.&rsquo; This discrepancy is not an artifact of income differences. On the contrary, the average liberal family earns an average of 6 percent <i>more </i>per year than the average conservative family, yet still gives less away.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Later on, he notes that there&rsquo;s a collective action problem as well:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Consider that the total that Americans give annually to human service organizations to assist the vulnerable comes to about $40 billion. Now suppose that we could spread that sum across the 46.5 million Americans receiving food assistance, with zero overhead and complete effectiveness. It would come to just $860 per person per year.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As much as it fits a convenient narrative, it&rsquo;s awfully weaselly for liberals with political aspirations to claim conservatives are the stingy ones when those same liberals give miserly amounts of money to the people they purportedly care about.</p>\n<p>The Betos and Bernies of the world would probably counter that by saying: 1) poverty is a collective action problem that can only be solved by taxing everybody (one person can only make a tiny dent, so why bother?), 2) the ultra-<em>ultra</em>-rich deserve to be taxed (like, the Koch brothers. Not normal millionaires! Extra big millionaires! Billionaires! Those ones! Trump!), or 3) really this wealth should be harnessed via taxes that way nobody can be exempt. The fact that some can accumulate so much means our system must be fixed (by them&mdash;supposedly disinterested third parties).</p>\n<p>These points are varying degrees of wrong. 1) Lack of adequate provisions for the poor is absolutely a collective action problem. But it is also one that would probably be helped, on some level, with an extra $300,000 from the Sanders family if they would spare it.</p>\n<p>2) If the ultra-rich were the only ones taxed, even if taxed at an insanely high rate, the additional revenue generated would not be enough to cover the hefty price tag of the various social programs that progressives want to institute. There simply aren&rsquo;t anywhere close to enough Koch-level people in this country. We would also probably have a hard time safeguarding against capital flight, as any sane wealthy person would be wise to get his or her money out of the country as quick as possible.</p>\n<p>3) The idea that progressive politicians, people who are emblematic of this very problem, would be God&rsquo;s gift to man, able to fix poverty and wealth inequality despite being wealth-hoarders themselves is completely goofy. People like Sanders and O&rsquo;Rourke would have more credibility if they didn&rsquo;t engage in such hypocritical practices, condemning the big, bad rich people whose greed they want to harness for their own allegedly benevolent bidding.</p>",

                "text": "Bernie Sanders (who is now a millionaire) and his wife gave 3.4 percent of their income to charity. Beto O'Rourke and his wife gave less than 1 percent.\nLast night, The Washington Post reported that Beto O\u2019Rourke released his tax returns for the past ten years. Of course, the feel-good, inevitably government-expanding presidential contender should probably have been more hesitant to release his returns because it doesn\u2019t take much sleuthing to figure out from them that the O\u2019Rourkes made $370,412 in 2017 while giving a measly $1,166 of that income to charity. As The Post noted, this makes Beto\u2019s charitable giving less than one-third of 1 percent of his household income.\nOther candidates who claim conservatives are the true greedy ones and deserve to be smited for their fiscal sins don\u2019t stack up much better. Bernie Sanders and his wife gave roughly 3 percent of their astonishingly large $566,000 income to charity in 2017. Interestingly, Sanders recently talked about his impressive sum of book earnings, and Reason\u2019s Peter Suderman pointed out that the socialist is indeed a millionaire:\nI think it\u2019s genuinely great that Bernie Sanders is a millionaire, and that in becoming a millionaire, our nation\u2019s most well-known democratic socialist politician has, however inadvertently, started defending one of the core tenets of capitalism\u2014that if you come up with an idea for a product, make that product a reality in the world, and sell it to lots of willing buyers, it\u2019s perfectly just and reasonable for you to earn a lot of money as a result.\nHe\u2019s exactly right. None of these impressively wealthy Democratic presidential contenders should be scorned for making heaps, providing it\u2019s from creating value that people want to benefit from.\nKamala Harris (and her husband) made nearly $2 million in 2018, giving 1.4 percent to charity (which totals out to about $27,000); Elizabeth Warren (and her husband) made just shy of $1 million (donating an improved 5.5 percent to charity in 2018). They should, however, be thoroughly criticized for demonizing millionaires and billionaires, branding them the no good, very bad, super icky ultra-wealthy, when they are some of the wealthiest people in America.\nOf course, many super-wealthy people don\u2019t think of themselves that way. A YouGov poll from earlier this year found that almost 90 percent of respondents who make $90,000 or more annually consider themselves neither rich nor poor. There\u2019s nothing wrong with abundance, but it is odd that people would be not more self-aware about where they stand compared to the groups many routinely demonize.\nCharitable giving should transcend political affiliation. It would be bad for our broader societal health if generosity were grossly weaponized to score political points, because then giving becomes more of a manipulative political ploy than it already is (to recipients, the intention behind giving probably doesn\u2019t make a difference).\nThere\u2019s something to be said for giving credit where due and recognizing when our political opponents do genuine good. Still, Arthur Brooks wrote on broader charitable giving habits in his 2015 book \u201cThe Conservative Heart,\u201d noting:\nHouseholds headed by a \u2018conservative\u2019 give, on average, 30 percent more dollars to charity than households headed by a \u2018liberal.\u2019 This discrepancy is not an artifact of income differences. On the contrary, the average liberal family earns an average of 6 percent more per year than the average conservative family, yet still gives less away.\nLater on, he notes that there\u2019s a collective action problem as well:\nConsider that the total that Americans give annually to human service organizations to assist the vulnerable comes to about $40 billion. Now suppose that we could spread that sum across the 46.5 million Americans receiving food assistance, with zero overhead and complete effectiveness. It would come to just $860 per person per year.\nAs much as it fits a convenient narrative, it\u2019s awfully weaselly for liberals with political aspirations to claim conservatives are the stingy ones when those same liberals give miserly amounts of money to the people they purportedly care about.\nThe Betos and Bernies of the world would probably counter that by saying: 1) poverty is a collective action problem that can only be solved by taxing everybody (one person can only make a tiny dent, so why bother?), 2) the ultra-ultra-rich deserve to be taxed (like, the Koch brothers. Not normal millionaires! Extra big millionaires! Billionaires! Those ones! Trump!), or 3) really this wealth should be harnessed via taxes that way nobody can be exempt. The fact that some can accumulate so much means our system must be fixed (by them\u2014supposedly disinterested third parties).\nThese points are varying degrees of wrong. 1) Lack of adequate provisions for the poor is absolutely a collective action problem. But it is also one that would probably be helped, on some level, with an extra $300,000 from the Sanders family if they would spare it.\n2) If the ultra-rich were the only ones taxed, even if taxed at an insanely high rate, the additional revenue generated would not be enough to cover the hefty price tag of the various social programs that progressives want to institute. There simply aren\u2019t anywhere close to enough Koch-level people in this country. We would also probably have a hard time safeguarding against capital flight, as any sane wealthy person would be wise to get his or her money out of the country as quick as possible.\n3) The idea that progressive politicians, people who are emblematic of this very problem, would be God\u2019s gift to man, able to fix poverty and wealth inequality despite being wealth-hoarders themselves is completely goofy. People like Sanders and O\u2019Rourke would have more credibility if they didn\u2019t engage in such hypocritical practices, condemning the big, bad rich people whose greed they want to harness for their own allegedly benevolent bidding.",

There is no more serious charge against an elected official than treason.</p>\n<p>Then again, for decades before the 2016 election, Democrats argued that Republicans were literally killing their fellow Americans when <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/15/9-apocalyptic-lies-fed-to-americans-about-the-republican-tax-bill/\">cutting taxes</a>, murdering <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGnE83A1Z4U\">the sick</a> when rejecting nationalized health care, and sentencing the poor to death when rejecting socialist schemes. Not to mention suppressing the minority vote when asking for ID, engaging in Nazi-like actions when <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2017/02/17/stop-belittling-holocaust-with-stupid-nazi-analogies/\">enforcing existing border laws</a>, and destroying the world when failing to embrace a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/democrats-apocalyptic-global-warming-rhetoric-doesnt-match-their-actions\">takeover</a> of the economy. And so on.</p>\n<p>This overwrought rhetoric is embedded in the everyday arguments of the mainstream left, and its intensity is only growing.</p>\n<p>The same liberals are now demanding that conservatives stop <em>quoting</em> and posting video of progressive Rep. Ilhan Omar <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1116817144006750209\">belittling the 9/11 attacks</a> because doing so puts her life in danger. That&rsquo;s quite the deal they&rsquo;ve cooked up for themselves. Nearly every presidential candidate and major Democratic leader has argued that Donald Trump&rsquo;s criticism of Omar is out of line because of increased death threats against her. I do wonder how many death threats Trump or Mitch McConnell or Steve Scalise receives every week. I imagine it&rsquo;s considerable.</p>\n<p>But, as usual, most of the media took up the Democrats&rsquo; cause, trying to infantilize a 38-year-old woman. &ldquo;Trump clearly unmoved over increased concerns raised by Dems over Omar&rsquo;s safety,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1117783503448563718\">noted</a> The Washington Post&rsquo;s CNN&rsquo;s Manu Raju after Trump attacked Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s handling of the Minnesota representative. One wonders if Raju had similar apprehensions when he published a story with two alleged sources <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2017/12/11/political-journalists-credibility/\">giving him</a> the same exact incorrect information falsely accusing Donald Trump Jr. of conspiring with Russia?</p>\n<p>Do reporters and columnists consider the safety of the Trump administration before writing critically about them? I hope not. Because free speech&mdash;political discourse and good faith political reporting included&mdash;shouldn&rsquo;t be inhibited by prospective actions of third-party nuts. It is imperative, in fact, that we don&rsquo;t let those nuts undercut our ability to freely express our political disagreements. If Americans pondered the actions of political terrorists every time they took a position, they would only be empowering criminals.</p>\n<p>Not one of Trump&rsquo;s critical comments about Omar called for violence in any way. He didn&rsquo;t <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2018/10/11/yes-its-a-mob-and-yes-its-what-democrats-want/\">rationalize</a> chasing Omar out of a restaurants or standing in front of her home with a bullhorn. The idea that politicians should have immunity from criticism is not something journalists, or anyone who values free expression, should give any credence. Yet, here we are.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s remember one of the times we actually saw overt political violence was when progressive activist and Bernie Sanders campaign volunteer <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-steve-scalise-shooting-20171006-story.html\">attempted to assassinate</a> the entire Republican congressional delegation. As far as I can tell, no one in the media asked Sanders or any other Democrats to temper their political rhetoric about Republicans. If the reverse had occurred we would have been plunged into a national discussion about right-wing rhetoric. (Wait, what am I saying, Republicans are already asked to take <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/434450-administration-officials-dismiss-criticism-that-trump-rhetoric-to\">responsibility</a> for violent actions of people who have nothing to do with them!)</p>\n<p>Attempting to chill speech isn&rsquo;t a new tactic for Democrats, and certainly not when it comes to Omar. As an African-American Muslim woman, the congresswoman has reached the pinnacle of special status, and thus any criticism, even quoting her verbatim or playing a video of her <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReaganBattalion/status/1116390602546003973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fpolitics%2Filhan-omar-jokes-al-qaeda-america\">yucking it up</a> about terrorism, is categorized as racist. There are no specific guidelines for when it&rsquo;s acceptable to be critical of the things an African-American Muslim woman politician says, though, for most people the answer is &ldquo;never.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Of course, the notion that someone&rsquo;s color or ethnicity or religion offers them dispensation from political debate is one of the most destructive aspect of this debate.</p>\n<p>Democrats chose to rally around Omar, celebrating her immigrant story and appearing with her on magazine covers. Now those Democrats are compelled to cover up and rationalize her comments (though we shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate how popular some of her anti-Jewish tirades and ugly views of America are among progressives). There is no freshman-level Marxist gobbledygook or <a href=\"https://townhall.com/columnists/marinamedvin/2019/04/16/everyone-is-missing-the-biggest-questions-with-ilhan-omars-911-downplay-n2544841\">conspiracy theory</a> that Omar won&rsquo;t regurgitate, from claiming that the US was &ldquo;founded by genocide&rdquo; to claiming that American power is built through &ldquo;neocolonialism&rdquo; to embracing morally decrepit ideas about the Middle East and Jews.</p>\n<p>Democrats first covered for her actions by watering down an already-useless resolution condemning her anti-Semitic comments with a bunch of vacuous censures of all bigotry. Even today, Democrats and their media allies continue to mislead about what Omar actually said. This week, Maggie Haberman and Sheryl Gay Stolberg of the New York Times, for example, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/us/politics/trump-ilhan-omar.html\">described</a> Omar as being in trouble over &ldquo;comments on Israel.&rdquo; Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://twitter.com/People4Bernie/status/1117933734131462144\">offered the same falsehood</a> in his Fox News town hall when he claimed &ldquo;It is not anti-Semitic to be critical of a right wing government in Israel.&rdquo; The comments Omar was in trouble for weren&rsquo;t about Israel. Of course, her continuous attacks on our liberal allies and her defense of proto-terrorist states is one thing. But Omar was in trouble for <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2019/03/07/democratic-party-has-normalized-anti-semitism/\">smearing American Jews, not merely Israel</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, they&rsquo;ve moved onto covering for her with &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/11/some-people-did-something-rep-omars-remarks-context/?utm_term=.908a7070da2a\">fact checks</a>&rdquo; and feigned indignation.

                "text": "As a public figure with strong opinions, Omar deserves no special immunity from criticism or debate.\nDemocrats have spent the past two-plus years accusing the president of the United States and his allies of seditiously conspiring with our enemies to destroy \u201cdemocracy.\u201d For the most part this fairytale has been cynically deployed by politicians to undermine the legitimacy of a Republican presidency, yet millions of Americans now believe their votes were upended by a foreign power. There is no more serious charge against an elected official than treason.\nThen again, for decades before the 2016 election, Democrats argued that Republicans were literally killing their fellow Americans when cutting taxes, murdering the sick when rejecting nationalized health care, and sentencing the poor to death when rejecting socialist schemes. Not to mention suppressing the minority vote when asking for ID, engaging in Nazi-like actions when enforcing existing border laws, and destroying the world when failing to embrace a takeover of the economy. And so on.\nThis overwrought rhetoric is embedded in the everyday arguments of the mainstream left, and its intensity is only growing.\nThe same liberals are now demanding that conservatives stop quoting and posting video of progressive Rep. Ilhan Omar belittling the 9/11 attacks because doing so puts her life in danger. That\u2019s quite the deal they\u2019ve cooked up for themselves. Nearly every presidential candidate and major Democratic leader has argued that Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of Omar is out of line because of increased death threats against her. I do wonder how many death threats Trump or Mitch McConnell or Steve Scalise receives every week. I imagine it\u2019s considerable.\nBut, as usual, most of the media took up the Democrats\u2019 cause, trying to infantilize a 38-year-old woman. \u201cTrump clearly unmoved over increased concerns raised by Dems over Omar\u2019s safety,\u201d noted The Washington Post\u2019s CNN\u2019s Manu Raju after Trump attacked Nancy Pelosi\u2019s handling of the Minnesota representative. One wonders if Raju had similar apprehensions when he published a story with two alleged sources giving him the same exact incorrect information falsely accusing Donald Trump Jr. of conspiring with Russia?\nDo reporters and columnists consider the safety of the Trump administration before writing critically about them? I hope not. Because free speech\u2014political discourse and good faith political reporting included\u2014shouldn\u2019t be inhibited by prospective actions of third-party nuts. It is imperative, in fact, that we don\u2019t let those nuts undercut our ability to freely express our political disagreements. If Americans pondered the actions of political terrorists every time they took a position, they would only be empowering criminals.\nNot one of Trump\u2019s critical comments about Omar called for violence in any way. He didn\u2019t rationalize chasing Omar out of a restaurants or standing in front of her home with a bullhorn. The idea that politicians should have immunity from criticism is not something journalists, or anyone who values free expression, should give any credence. Yet, here we are.\nLet\u2019s remember one of the times we actually saw overt political violence was when progressive activist and Bernie Sanders campaign volunteer attempted to assassinate the entire Republican congressional delegation. As far as I can tell, no one in the media asked Sanders or any other Democrats to temper their political rhetoric about Republicans. If the reverse had occurred we would have been plunged into a national discussion about right-wing rhetoric. (Wait, what am I saying, Republicans are already asked to take responsibility for violent actions of people who have nothing to do with them!)\nAttempting to chill speech isn\u2019t a new tactic for Democrats, and certainly not when it comes to Omar. As an African-American Muslim woman, the congresswoman has reached the pinnacle of special status, and thus any criticism, even quoting her verbatim or playing a video of her yucking it up about terrorism, is categorized as racist. There are no specific guidelines for when it\u2019s acceptable to be critical of the things an African-American Muslim woman politician says, though, for most people the answer is \u201cnever.\u201d\nOf course, the notion that someone\u2019s color or ethnicity or religion offers them dispensation from political debate is one of the most destructive aspect of this debate.\nDemocrats chose to rally around Omar, celebrating her immigrant story and appearing with her on magazine covers. Now those Democrats are compelled to cover up and rationalize her comments (though we shouldn\u2019t underestimate how popular some of her anti-Jewish tirades and ugly views of America are among progressives). There is no freshman-level Marxist gobbledygook or conspiracy theory that Omar won\u2019t regurgitate, from claiming that the US was \u201cfounded by genocide\u201d to claiming that American power is built through \u201cneocolonialism\u201d to embracing morally decrepit ideas about the Middle East and Jews.\nDemocrats first covered for her actions by watering down an already-useless resolution condemning her anti-Semitic comments with a bunch of vacuous censures of all bigotry. Even today, Democrats and their media allies continue to mislead about what Omar actually said. This week, Maggie Haberman and Sheryl Gay Stolberg of the New York Times, for example, described Omar as being in trouble over \u201ccomments on Israel.\u201d Bernie Sanders offered the same falsehood in his Fox News town hall when he claimed \u201cIt is not anti-Semitic to be critical of a right wing government in Israel.\u201d The comments Omar was in trouble for weren\u2019t about Israel. Of course, her continuous attacks on our liberal allies and her defense of proto-terrorist states is one thing. But Omar was in trouble for smearing American Jews, not merely Israel.\nNow, they\u2019ve moved onto covering for her with \u201cfact checks\u201d and feigned indignation. It is clear to me that Omar was minimizing 9/11, as she does Islamic terrorism in general. It\u2019s clear to me she is a defender of theocrats and an apologist for terror organizations like Hamas. You might disagree. You can view her comments and decide for yourself. Whatever the case, threats of violence against politicians are illegal and should be condemned by any decent person. In the end, though, whether Omar has increased threats against her or not, she is a public figure and deserves no special dispensation from debate.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Federalist, a wholly independent division of FDRLST Media, All Rights Reserved.",

If that's true, who else are they doing it against?</p>\n<p>When Attorney General William Barr acknowledged the Donald Trump campaign was <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/10/barr-confirms-multiple-intel-agencies-implicated-in-anti-trump-spy-operation/\">spied on</a> in 2016 by agencies investigating a dramatic conspiracy theory about alleged collusion with Russia, and said he&rsquo;d like to review the matter, those who pushed the theory began to panic.</p>\n<p>Some media figures attempted to deny that spying had occurred, even though it had been revealed in various and sundry ways. They conceded that overseas intelligence assets had been placed against the campaign, that wiretaps had been secured, and that national security letters had been drafted, but they claimed these examples of spying were not spying. That they&rsquo;d regularly and repeatedly referred to them as <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2016/07/01/media/fbi-spy-journalists/index.html\">spying</a> in non-Trump contexts slowed them down not at all.</p>\n<p>Some tried to pretend that the only example of spying was the surveillance of Carter Page, but that it didn&rsquo;t count because he&rsquo;d left the campaign before the surveillance began. There were a few problems, including that wiretaps can be used to secure information from months and years prior to the date it is obtained. Besides, Page had encounters with an overseas U.S. intelligence asset while he was still on the campaign. So had other campaign affiliates.</p>\n<p>The media had previously reported that four Trump affiliates had been</p>\n<p>Last Friday on MSNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morning Joe,&rdquo; a quintet of pundits <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/joe-scarborough-tears-into-bill-barrs-reckless-and-irresponsible-spying-remarks-hes-destroying-his-legacy/\">sputtered about Barr&rsquo;s description</a>. Barr specifically said he was not saying anything improper had definitively happened, just that it needed to be reviewed since spying on American citizens was such a serious thing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Spying did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Barr referenced controversial spying on American citizens during the Vietnam War, which led to reforms in the laws governing such spying.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,&rdquo; Barr said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s big deal. The generation I grew up in, which was the Vietnam War period, you know, people were all concerned about spying on the antiwar people and so forth by the government. And there were a lot of rules put in place to make sure that there&rsquo;s an adequate basis before our law-enforcement agencies get involved in political surveillance. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that those rules were violated.

If that's true, who else are they doing it against?\nWhen Attorney General William Barr acknowledged the Donald Trump campaign was spied on in 2016 by agencies investigating a dramatic conspiracy theory about alleged collusion with Russia, and said he\u2019d like to review the matter, those who pushed the theory began to panic.\nSome media figures attempted to deny that spying had occurred, even though it had been revealed in various and sundry ways. They conceded that overseas intelligence assets had been placed against the campaign, that wiretaps had been secured, and that national security letters had been drafted, but they claimed these examples of spying were not spying. That they\u2019d regularly and repeatedly referred to them as spying in non-Trump contexts slowed them down not at all.\nSome tried to pretend that the only example of spying was the surveillance of Carter Page, but that it didn\u2019t count because he\u2019d left the campaign before the surveillance began. There were a few problems, including that wiretaps can be used to secure information from months and years prior to the date it is obtained. Besides, Page had encounters with an overseas U.S. intelligence asset while he was still on the campaign. So had other campaign affiliates.\nThe media had previously reported that four Trump affiliates had been\nLast Friday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d a quintet of pundits sputtered about Barr\u2019s description. Barr specifically said he was not saying anything improper had definitively happened, just that it needed to be reviewed since spying on American citizens was such a serious thing.\n\u201cSpying did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated,\u201d he said.\nBarr referenced controversial spying on American citizens during the Vietnam War, which led to reforms in the laws governing such spying.\n\u201cI think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,\u201d Barr said. \u201cIt\u2019s big deal. The generation I grew up in, which was the Vietnam War period, you know, people were all concerned about spying on the antiwar people and so forth by the government. And there were a lot of rules put in place to make sure that there\u2019s an adequate basis before our law-enforcement agencies get involved in political surveillance. I\u2019m not suggesting that those rules were violated. But I think it\u2019s important to look at that,\u201d he said, adding that he felt an \u201cobligation to make sure that government power was not abused.\u201d\nNational affairs analyst John Heilemann said, inexplicably, there was \u201cno evidence\u201d for Barr\u2019s claim. Host Joe Scarborough then pivoted to a completely different line of argument. He said that while there was no evidence of spying, such spying on political opponents is a totally normal and accepted practice.\n\u201cEverything was done by the book and there were procedural safeguards,\u201d Scarborough said, before sputtering that Barr was \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201creckless and irresponsible.\u201d He also said the well regarded attorney who soberly stated indisputable facts was \u201cdestroying his legacy here.\u201d\nWhile a thorough investigation will need to be performed to figure out how the FBI and other agencies got wrapped up in a conspiracy theory that they felt justified breaking norms and spying on political foes, it is not true that everything was \u201cby the book.\u201d\nFor example, FBI Director James Comey failed to notify Congress for nine months that an investigation into the Trump campaign had been opened, even though he was supposed to provide quarterly updates about particularly sensitive investigations. In fact, Rep. Elise Stefanik just introduced legislation to make it more difficult for FBI directors to thwart \u201cthe book\u201d on these matters.\nWhile at least four spy secret surveillance warrants were approved, a congressional investigation by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence described the verification effort before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) not as \u201cby the book\u201d but so inadequate it resembled a concerted effort to conceal information from the court:\nA salacious and unverified dossier formed an essential part of the application to secure a warrant against a Trump campaign affiliate named Carter Page. This application failed to reveal that the dossier was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.\nThe application presented a Yahoo News article as corroboration for the dossier, when in fact it was sourced to the dossier\u2019s author Christopher Steele.\nThe wife of a high-ranking Justice Department official also worked on behalf of the Clinton campaign effort, and her husband Bruce Ohr funneled her research into the Department of Justice. Although he admitted that Steele \u201cwas desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president,\u201d this and the Ohrs\u2019 relationship with the Clinton campaign was concealed from the secret court that grants surveillance warrants.\nThe dossier was \u201conly minimally corroborated\u201d and unverified, according to FBI officials.\nA criminal referral from the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmed that the dossier was unverified when it was used to secure the wiretaps.\nA third example of the anti-Trump campaign not going \u201cby the book\u201d was the widespread use of leaks to further the investigation and the false narrative of treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the election. U.S. officials selectively leaked information to frequently give the impression that Trump was a threat to national security because of his illegal actions with Vladimir Putin.\nLeaking classified information is illegal, although no one has been held responsible yet for the criminal leak against Flynn, which falsely suggested he was an agent of Putin.

Current estimates are that approximately one-third of professional academic biologists who do not believe in intelligent design find Darwin&rsquo;s theory is inadequate to describe all of the complexity in biology.</p>\n<p>Ben Stein documented a crackdown within the academy on criticism of Darwin in his 2008 documentary &ldquo;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/V5EPymcWp-g\">Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed</a>.&rdquo; While this might explain why the public rarely hears of challenges to Neo-Darwinism, the documentary centered on intelligent design. But the growing discontent in academia is from secular naturalists.</p>\n<p>Defining evolution is key. At the basic level of <em>change over time</em>, even Young Earth biblical creationists agree. At its most specific level of <em>the common descent of all life on earth from a single ancestor via undirected mutation and natural selection</em>, many legitimately question evolutionary theory as it stands. The word is often used interchangeably without distinction, but even when used technically in academic biologist circles, real skepticism exists about the theory.</p>\n<h2>Demanding a New Theory</h2>\n<p>A controversial <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/does-evolutionary-theory-need-a-rethink-1.16080\">letter to Nature</a> in 2014 signaled the mounting concern, however slow and cautious, among thoughtful professional biologists. Other works by atheist authors like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/64/4/355/248583\">What Darwin Got Wrong</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/64/4/355/248583\">Mind and Cosmos</a>&rdquo; find &ldquo;fatal flaws&rdquo; in the theory and assert it is &ldquo;almost certainly false.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Another project, <a href=\"https://www.thethirdwayofevolution.com/people\">The Third Way</a>, seeks to avoid a false choice between divine intervention (which it outright rejects) and the Neo-Darwinian model (which it finds unsupported in the face of modern molecular theory) while presenting evidence to improve evolution theory beyond Neo-Darwinism. Some even believe billions of years have <a href=\"http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2012.4\">not been adequate</a> for Darwinian theory to accomplish current complexity, as the theory currently exists.</p>\n<p>This dissatisfaction is a matter of public record, even if it lacks public attention, and despite the narrative running contrary. Indeed dedicated Neo-Darwinists often say &ldquo;no serious scientists disagree&rdquo; or &ldquo;only creationists have problems.&rdquo; These contentions are increasingly disproven.</p>\n<p>The important note is that these are not ideologues or religious zealots, nor do they propose a god or biblical solution. Rather, they find problems with the explanatory value of Darwin&rsquo;s theory in light of modern understanding of mutation, variation, DNA sequencing, and more. These expressions of doubt do not reject naturalism or evolution per se, but the rigor of the Neo-Darwinian model for explaining the development of life.</p>\n<p>In fact, they want to help Darwin, not tear him down. That he needs help is news to the academy.</p>\n<h2>A Voice in the Wilderness</h2>\n<p>Professor Kevin Laland, author of the Nature letter insisting on &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; rethinking of evolutionary theory, has been described by critics as offering an unneeded <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-biologists-who-want-to-overhaul-evolution/508712/\">paradigm shift</a>. He recognizes the pushback from the scientific establishment, but he and his colleagues forge a path forward nonetheless with rigorous work on their model of <a href=\"http://extendedevolutionarysynthesis.com\">Extended Evolutionary Synthesis</a> (EES).</p>\n<p>This is an update to the mid-20th-century <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_synthesis_(20th_century)\">Modern Synthesis</a>, which patched up Neo-Darwinian theory with then-modern information. Since then, understanding of complexity has grown such that Laland and others believe EES or another supplement is necessary to keep up. It is not a replacement or rejection of Neo-Darwinism, but can be deployed alongside it as a way to understand key processes of nature the theory neglects.</p>\n<p>Laland explained, &ldquo;The EES is a minority position, but not as small a minority as it is often portrayed. It is also gaining ground.&rdquo; EES is not the only naturalist supplement or revision of Neo-Darwinism, but joins several other embattled factions in the academy, including The Third Way.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As you may surmise, there is a lot of politics in these debates. Traditionalists have a track record of characterising more progressive researchers as a small group of extremists,&rdquo; Leland added. Explaining why it is difficult to gain traction, he continued, &ldquo;support for our position comes from academic fields on the periphery of evolutionary biology, such as evolutionary developmental biology, ecological developmental biology, paleontology, botany, and the human sciences, while traditionalists dominate evolutionary genetics.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>A Growing Minority</h2>\n<p>After publishing in Nature, Laland received more than 1,000 emails in support from the academic community. This number is huge for a critique of such a longstanding accepted theory. In the five years since the Nature letter, support has also only grown.</p>\n<p>The leading critics have been intelligent design supporters, who are looked down on by naturalists. But as each group adds to the scientific literature, certain critiques and findings inevitably bolster or redirect the research of the other.</p>\n<p>The effects go at least one way. Following work and theories of Stephen Jay Gould, Michael Denton helped shape a generation of skeptics with his 1985 book &ldquo;Evolution: A Theory in Crisis.&rdquo; An evolutionist and agnostic, Denton <a href=\"https://inference-review.com/article/evolution-a-theory-in-crisis-revisited-part-one/\">has continued his criticism</a>.</p>\n<p>In the past decade, the works of professor Michael Behe, Steven Meyer, and others have given more life to the debate on the national stage. In &ldquo;Darwin Devolves,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNe-syuDJBg\">Behe points to the process of mutations</a> to describe the inadequacy of an unguided materialist process to add information. Meyer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDSpLBNQk5I\">explores the Cambrian explosion and the complexity of the cell</a> to show the biodiversity and complexity we observe, and notes that natural processes have <em>never</em> been observed to produce such results.</p>\n<p>Importantly, these two men, and many others, believe in the standard multibillion-year timeline for the Earth and make their findings based on deduction of natural evidence rather than starting from authority in scripture or elsewhere. The growth of the intelligent design community is noteworthy, but not as interesting as those who are apart from it, secular, and nonetheless find Darwinian evolution to contain serious flaws.</p>\n<p>Behe explained that, &ldquo;Based on conversations with my own colleagues at Lehigh [University], dozens of other biologists, and news stories in journals I would guesstimate that a third or more of biologists are quite skeptical that Darwin&rsquo;s theory explains all of biology.&rdquo; The growing literature speaks for itself.</p>\n<p>Paul Nelson told Stein that, &ldquo;One-on-one at a scientific meeting after the third or fourth beer, my experience has been that many evolutionary biologists will say &lsquo;Yeah, this theory&rsquo;s got a lot of problems.&rsquo;&rdquo; While anecdotal, this is echoed by many in academia, both within intelligent design, and more importantly outside of it.</p>\n<p>While maintaining his field is not in crisis, and insisting on nuance, Leland notes, &ldquo;I think the numbers issue depends strongly on subtle details of how you frame the question. A good proportion would probably agree that the causal bases of evolution are more complex than commonly portrayed in the textbooks.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Difficulties in Forming Alliances</h2>\n<p>Nuance and framing are important, and along with traditional pressures, make estimates of the Neo-Darwin critics incredibly difficult to conclude. One approach is to simply seek signatures on a simple scientific <a href=\"https://www.discovery.org/m/2019/02/A-Scientific-Dissent-from-Darwinism-List-04092019.pdf\">statement of skepticism</a>. Several hundred PhDs have signed. However, the association with intelligent design and possible academic consequences keeps many from signing.</p>\n<p>While intelligent design gets a bad rap, such titans as <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0019103573901103\">Francis Crick</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Pckg3Kud8_A?t=186\">Richard Dawkins</a> have espoused the same tenets. Still, many immediately and falsely link intelligent design with Christian divinity and stay far away.</p>\n<p>The Third Way is highly exclusive to maintain purity and preempt criticism. Not only are religious believers excluded, but the platform is invite-only. The isolated clusters of scientists averse to associating with one another, or too set on their preferred nuance, lend credence to the traditionalist Neo-Darwin assertion that only a tiny fringe minority, if that, exists.</p>\n<p>The plain truth from the literature, conferences, expert perception, and a bit of anecdote for color, is that current Neo-Darwinism is far from the untouchable theory it is lauded to be. Not only this, but it has serious and increasing skeptics and challengers from within the secular scientific community.</p>\n<p>When adding in supporters of intelligent design, which is religion-neutral, the numbers begin to expand rapidly. While there are serious, scientific, and peer-reviewed studies from this group, it does not rock the boat as much as the secular material naturalists. The goal is not to abandon Darwin, but to retire him to make way for more coherent comprehensive theories.</p>\n<p><em>This article has been slightly changed to clarify the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis.

Some even believe billions of years have not been adequate for Darwinian theory to accomplish current complexity, as the theory currently exists.\nThis dissatisfaction is a matter of public record, even if it lacks public attention, and despite the narrative running contrary. Indeed dedicated Neo-Darwinists often say \u201cno serious scientists disagree\u201d or \u201conly creationists have problems.\u201d These contentions are increasingly disproven.\nThe important note is that these are not ideologues or religious zealots, nor do they propose a god or biblical solution. Rather, they find problems with the explanatory value of Darwin\u2019s theory in light of modern understanding of mutation, variation, DNA sequencing, and more. These expressions of doubt do not reject naturalism or evolution per se, but the rigor of the Neo-Darwinian model for explaining the development of life.\nIn fact, they want to help Darwin, not tear him down. That he needs help is news to the academy.\nA Voice in the Wilderness\nProfessor Kevin Laland, author of the Nature letter insisting on \u201curgent\u201d rethinking of evolutionary theory, has been described by critics as offering an unneeded paradigm shift. He recognizes the pushback from the scientific establishment, but he and his colleagues forge a path forward nonetheless with rigorous work on their model of Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES).\nThis is an update to the mid-20th-century Modern Synthesis, which patched up Neo-Darwinian theory with then-modern information. Since then, understanding of complexity has grown such that Laland and others believe EES or another supplement is necessary to keep up. It is not a replacement or rejection of Neo-Darwinism, but can be deployed alongside it as a way to understand key processes of nature the theory neglects.\nLaland explained, \u201cThe EES is a minority position, but not as small a minority as it is often portrayed. It is also gaining ground.\u201d EES is not the only naturalist supplement or revision of Neo-Darwinism, but joins several other embattled factions in the academy, including The Third Way.\n\u201cAs you may surmise, there is a lot of politics in these debates. Traditionalists have a track record of characterising more progressive researchers as a small group of extremists,\u201d Leland added. Explaining why it is difficult to gain traction, he continued, \u201csupport for our position comes from academic fields on the periphery of evolutionary biology, such as evolutionary developmental biology, ecological developmental biology, paleontology, botany, and the human sciences, while traditionalists dominate evolutionary genetics.\u201d\nA Growing Minority\nAfter publishing in Nature, Laland received more than 1,000 emails in support from the academic community. This number is huge for a critique of such a longstanding accepted theory. In the five years since the Nature letter, support has also only grown.\nThe leading critics have been intelligent design supporters, who are looked down on by naturalists. But as each group adds to the scientific literature, certain critiques and findings inevitably bolster or redirect the research of the other.\nThe effects go at least one way. Following work and theories of Stephen Jay Gould, Michael Denton helped shape a generation of skeptics with his 1985 book \u201cEvolution: A Theory in Crisis.\u201d An evolutionist and agnostic, Denton has continued his criticism.\nIn the past decade, the works of professor Michael Behe, Steven Meyer, and others have given more life to the debate on the national stage. In \u201cDarwin Devolves,\u201d Behe points to the process of mutations to describe the inadequacy of an unguided materialist process to add information. Meyer explores the Cambrian explosion and the complexity of the cell to show the biodiversity and complexity we observe, and notes that natural processes have never been observed to produce such results.\nImportantly, these two men, and many others, believe in the standard multibillion-year timeline for the Earth and make their findings based on deduction of natural evidence rather than starting from authority in scripture or elsewhere. The growth of the intelligent design community is noteworthy, but not as interesting as those who are apart from it, secular, and nonetheless find Darwinian evolution to contain serious flaws.\nBehe explained that, \u201cBased on conversations with my own colleagues at Lehigh [University], dozens of other biologists, and news stories in journals I would guesstimate that a third or more of biologists are quite skeptical that Darwin\u2019s theory explains all of biology.\u201d The growing literature speaks for itself.\nPaul Nelson told Stein that, \u201cOne-on-one at a scientific meeting after the third or fourth beer, my experience has been that many evolutionary biologists will say \u2018Yeah, this theory\u2019s got a lot of problems.\u2019\u201d While anecdotal, this is echoed by many in academia, both within intelligent design, and more importantly outside of it.\nWhile maintaining his field is not in crisis, and insisting on nuance, Leland notes, \u201cI think the numbers issue depends strongly on subtle details of how you frame the question. A good proportion would probably agree that the causal bases of evolution are more complex than commonly portrayed in the textbooks.\u201d\nDifficulties in Forming Alliances\nNuance and framing are important, and along with traditional pressures, make estimates of the Neo-Darwin critics incredibly difficult to conclude. One approach is to simply seek signatures on a simple scientific statement of skepticism. Several hundred PhDs have signed. However, the association with intelligent design and possible academic consequences keeps many from signing.\nWhile intelligent design gets a bad rap, such titans as Francis Crick and Richard Dawkins have espoused the same tenets. Still, many immediately and falsely link intelligent design with Christian divinity and stay far away.\nThe Third Way is highly exclusive to maintain purity and preempt criticism. Not only are religious believers excluded, but the platform is invite-only. The isolated clusters of scientists averse to associating with one another, or too set on their preferred nuance, lend credence to the traditionalist Neo-Darwin assertion that only a tiny fringe minority, if that, exists.\nThe plain truth from the literature, conferences, expert perception, and a bit of anecdote for color, is that current Neo-Darwinism is far from the untouchable theory it is lauded to be. Not only this, but it has serious and increasing skeptics and challengers from within the secular scientific community.\nWhen adding in supporters of intelligent design, which is religion-neutral, the numbers begin to expand rapidly. While there are serious, scientific, and peer-reviewed studies from this group, it does not rock the boat as much as the secular material naturalists. The goal is not to abandon Darwin, but to retire him to make way for more coherent comprehensive theories.\nThis article has been slightly changed to clarify the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis. The original draft described it as a paradigm shift, which Laland says is inaccurate.\nBenjamin thinks, writes, and talks about economics, law, and public policy. His articles are intended to present issues in a new light to readers and do not necessarily reflect personal opinion.

Without warning the government, Mr Bercow ruled that Downing Street could not put Theresa May&rsquo;s Brexit deal, which has already twice been rejected by large majorities, to a third vote unless it was changed in substance. The Speaker&rsquo;s decision was based on precedents set down by the Bible on parliamentary procedure, &ldquo;Erskine May&rdquo;, against holding repeated votes in the same parliamentary session on a matter already decided by MPs.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Speaker of America&rsquo;s House of Representatives, who is the head of the majority party, the British Speaker, an MP chosen by their peers, is supposed to be a neutral referee. Mr Bercow, who has occupied the canopied chair for nearly ten years, is unpopular with most Tories, who believe he is a Remainer bent on sabotaging Brexit. Indeed, his ruling yesterday was welcomed by those calling for a softer Brexit, as well as those campaigning for a second referendum. Yet many hardline Brexiteers opposed to Mrs May&rsquo;s deal also praised it. They seemed to think that, by making it still harder for the prime minister to pass her deal, the ruling makes a no-deal Brexit more likely.</p>\n<h2 data-test-id=\"Regwall Headline\">Choose us for news analysis that respects your time and intelligence</h2>\n<p>Get up to <strong>80% off</strong> a quarterly subscription with</p>\n<p><a data-test-id=\"Regwall Subscribe Button\" href=\"https://subscription.economist.com/DE/EngCore/EcomNewArticle/RegwallSub\">View subscription options</a></p>\n<p>Cancel at any time.

Without warning the government, Mr Bercow ruled that Downing Street could not put Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, which has already twice been rejected by large majorities, to a third vote unless it was changed in substance. The Speaker\u2019s decision was based on precedents set down by the Bible on parliamentary procedure, \u201cErskine May\u201d, against holding repeated votes in the same parliamentary session on a matter already decided by MPs.\nUnlike the Speaker of America\u2019s House of Representatives, who is the head of the majority party, the British Speaker, an MP chosen by their peers, is supposed to be a neutral referee. Mr Bercow, who has occupied the canopied chair for nearly ten years, is unpopular with most Tories, who believe he is a Remainer bent on sabotaging Brexit. Indeed, his ruling yesterday was welcomed by those calling for a softer Brexit, as well as those campaigning for a second referendum. Yet many hardline Brexiteers opposed to Mrs May\u2019s deal also praised it. They seemed to think that, by making it still harder for the prime minister to pass her deal, the ruling makes a no-deal Brexit more likely.\nChoose us for news analysis that respects your time and intelligence\nGet up to 80% off a quarterly subscription with\nView subscription options\nCancel at any time.

Over a dozen countries&mdash;ranging from friends to overt rivals&mdash;sent naval vessels to the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao on April 23rd. There they steamed past a destroyer carrying China&rsquo;s commander-in-chief, President Xi Jinping, in honour of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army Navy.</p>\n<p>Paint gleaming and brass fittings buffed to a hospital shine, there were frigates from near-allies such as Russia, and destroyers from almost-foes like India. Their mission was friendship and diplomacy. But these were heavily armed peace envoys, warily visiting a China whose emergence as an ocean-going nation is shaking Asia, and may one day change the world. Visitors involved in territorial disputes with China, including Japan and Vietnam, sent ships bristling with weaponry. America sent no ships at all.</p>\n<h2 data-test-id=\"Regwall Headline\">Choose us for news analysis that respects your time and intelligence</h2>\n<p>Get up to <strong>80% off</strong> a quarterly subscription with</p>\n<p><a data-test-id=\"Regwall Subscribe Button\" href=\"https://subscription.economist.com/DE/EngCore/EcomNewArticle/RegwallSub\">View subscription options</a></p>\n<p>Cancel at any time.

The research, which the authors summarised in a seminal book, &ldquo;Myth and Measurement&rdquo;, published in 1995, drew a scathing initial response.

Proton cars are not quite so ubiquitous. Founded in 1983 by Malaysia&rsquo;s government, the Proton company strove to build a truly &ldquo;national car&rdquo;, but its parent lost over 1bn ringgit ($280m) in the two financial years before it sold a stake to Geely, a Chinese carmaker, in 2017. Neighbouring Thailand, in contrast, lacks a national car, but boasts a thriving car industry. Carmaking took off in the late 1980s after Japanese multinationals flocked to the country, importing whatever they could not make or buy within its borders. Foreign parts still account for 56% of the value of Thailand&rsquo;s car exports, according to the most recent data from the World Trade Organisation (WTO). But the remaining home-grown value exceeds the total worth of Malaysia&rsquo;s car exports several times over.</p>\n<p>Thailand&rsquo;s cosmopolitan car industry illustrates the potential of &ldquo;global value chains&rdquo;, which link several countries in the production of a good or service. Unfortunately, these chains declined relative to world GDP between 2011 and 2016, contributing to what has been dubbed &ldquo;slowbalisation&rdquo;. But a new report by the WTO (and a long chain of partners, including the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing and the China Development Research Foundation, a Chinese government think-tank) finds that value chains recovered a little in 2017.</p>\n<h2 data-test-id=\"Regwall Headline\">Choose us for news analysis that respects your time and intelligence</h2>\n<p>Get up to <strong>80% off</strong> a quarterly subscription with</p>\n<p><a data-test-id=\"Regwall Subscribe Button\" href=\"https://subscription.economist.com/DE/EngCore/EcomNewArticle/RegwallSub\">View subscription options</a></p>\n<p>Cancel at any time.

Founded in 1983 by Malaysia\u2019s government, the Proton company strove to build a truly \u201cnational car\u201d, but its parent lost over 1bn ringgit ($280m) in the two financial years before it sold a stake to Geely, a Chinese carmaker, in 2017. Neighbouring Thailand, in contrast, lacks a national car, but boasts a thriving car industry. Carmaking took off in the late 1980s after Japanese multinationals flocked to the country, importing whatever they could not make or buy within its borders. Foreign parts still account for 56% of the value of Thailand\u2019s car exports, according to the most recent data from the World Trade Organisation (WTO). But the remaining home-grown value exceeds the total worth of Malaysia\u2019s car exports several times over.\nThailand\u2019s cosmopolitan car industry illustrates the potential of \u201cglobal value chains\u201d, which link several countries in the production of a good or service. Unfortunately, these chains declined relative to world GDP between 2011 and 2016, contributing to what has been dubbed \u201cslowbalisation\u201d. But a new report by the WTO (and a long chain of partners, including the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing and the China Development Research Foundation, a Chinese government think-tank) finds that value chains recovered a little in 2017.\nChoose us for news analysis that respects your time and intelligence\nGet up to 80% off a quarterly subscription with\nView subscription options\nCancel at any time.

The question seems to have an obvious answer. Social media, says Joe Giacalone, a retired New York Police Department detective who now teaches at John Jay College, is &ldquo;a treasure trove for investigators. People post stuff they shouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;vehicles, weapons, you name it. If you&rsquo;re dumb enough to post something on social media and you&rsquo;re wanted for a crime, you deserve to get caught.&rdquo; In this sense, social media is no different from any other public space. If criminals brag about or plot their exploits publicly online, police should be able to use that information without obtaining a warrant, just as if they overheard chatter in a bar or on a street corner.</p>\n<p>But there is a difference between an individual officer looking at posts from someone suspected or accused of a specific crime, and the sort of mass monitoring made possible by data-scraping and automated surveillance. There is also a difference between looking for evidence of criminal activity and monitoring politically unpopular, but still legally protected, speech. Records obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California (ACLU-NC) revealed that in 2015 a police department in Fresno used a social-media monitoring firm that boasted it could &ldquo;avoid the warrant process when identifying social-media accounts for particular individuals,&rdquo; and could &ldquo;identify threats to public safety&rdquo; by monitoring terms including &ldquo;policebrutality&rdquo;, &ldquo;wewantjustice&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dissent&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blacklivesmatter&rdquo;. Other law-enforcement agencies in California used a similar service whose marketing materials referred to &ldquo;unions [and] activist groups&rdquo; as &ldquo;overt threats&rdquo;.</p>\n<h2 data-test-id=\"Regwall Headline\">Choose us for news analysis that respects your time and intelligence</h2>\n<p>Get up to <strong>80% off</strong> a quarterly subscription with</p>\n<p><a data-test-id=\"Regwall Subscribe Button\" href=\"https://subscription.economist.com/DE/EngCore/EcomNewArticle/RegwallSub\">View subscription options</a></p>\n<p>Cancel at any time.

Hub of a dying textiles industry, on the western edge of Charlotte, the county was missing out on the boom already rippling through the periphery of North Carolina&rsquo;s most dynamic city. For that reason Gastonia, its altogether less zippy capital, was not seeing many of the Mexican immigrants then pouring into the state, to labour on the building sites erupting in Charlotte and revive the poultry industry in Union County, east of the city. But this was about to change.</p>\n<p>Finding opportunities overlooked by others in Gastonia&rsquo;s run-down factories and mills, migrants started settling in the town&rsquo;s trailer parks and poor black neighbourhoods. Its Hispanic population soared, to around 6,000, or 9% of the total, within a few years. This caused friction with Gastonia&rsquo;s white majority, recalls Mr Garcia, who was born in Colombia. &ldquo;Mexicans like to get physically closer when they&rsquo;re talking to you than Anglos do. They might slaughter a chicken in their yard. They play loud music there.&rdquo; But the ill-will rarely went beyond grumbling about the migrants&rsquo; poor English. Some in Gastonia said this reflected the much deeper tensions in the South between whites and blacks. Resentment of immigrants was only a brief distraction from that main drama. In any event, the migrants, many of whom had either moved from Texas or come directly from the Rio Grande, expected no favours. &ldquo;So long as you treat people the right way, you&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; shrugged Elvira, who came to North Carolina to pick tobacco 25 years ago and now works at the &ldquo;Las Americas&rdquo; supermarket in Gastonia.</p>\n<h2 data-test-id=\"Regwall Headline\">Choose us for news analysis that respects your time and intelligence</h2>\n<p>Get up to <strong>80% off</strong> a quarterly subscription with</p>\n<p><a data-test-id=\"Regwall Subscribe Button\" href=\"https://subscription.economist.com/DE/EngCore/EcomNewArticle/RegwallSub\">View subscription options</a></p>\n<p>Cancel at any time.

Hub of a dying textiles industry, on the western edge of Charlotte, the county was missing out on the boom already rippling through the periphery of North Carolina\u2019s most dynamic city. For that reason Gastonia, its altogether less zippy capital, was not seeing many of the Mexican immigrants then pouring into the state, to labour on the building sites erupting in Charlotte and revive the poultry industry in Union County, east of the city. But this was about to change.\nFinding opportunities overlooked by others in Gastonia\u2019s run-down factories and mills, migrants started settling in the town\u2019s trailer parks and poor black neighbourhoods. Its Hispanic population soared, to around 6,000, or 9% of the total, within a few years. This caused friction with Gastonia\u2019s white majority, recalls Mr Garcia, who was born in Colombia. \u201cMexicans like to get physically closer when they\u2019re talking to you than Anglos do. They might slaughter a chicken in their yard. They play loud music there.\u201d But the ill-will rarely went beyond grumbling about the migrants\u2019 poor English. Some in Gastonia said this reflected the much deeper tensions in the South between whites and blacks. Resentment of immigrants was only a brief distraction from that main drama. In any event, the migrants, many of whom had either moved from Texas or come directly from the Rio Grande, expected no favours. \u201cSo long as you treat people the right way, you\u2019re all right,\u201d shrugged Elvira, who came to North Carolina to pick tobacco 25 years ago and now works at the \u201cLas Americas\u201d supermarket in Gastonia.\nChoose us for news analysis that respects your time and intelligence\nGet up to 80% off a quarterly subscription with\nView subscription options\nCancel at any time.

Five days later an 8,000lb (3,630kg) piece of steel fell on his foot, crushing it. After nearly dying from infections and losing part of his foot, Mr Feal found out that he was not eligible for financial help for his medical care. He created the Feal Good Foundation and became an advocate for his fellow first responders, travelling with busloads of firefighters and other sick or injured survivors to Washington to urge Congress to pass a bill paying for medical care and monitoring. After years of lobbying, in 2010 Congress passed the James Zadroga September 11 Health and Compensation Act to provide free medical care and create both a health registry and a victim compensation fund (VCF).</p>\n<p>The need was great. Thousands of first responders and survivors as well as those who worked and lived downtown were not well. When the towers fell a cloud of dust, made up of glass fibres, asbestos, lead, pulverised cement and a host of other carcinogens, was spewed into the air. Some first responders got sick right away, developing &ldquo;World Trade Centre cough&rdquo;, a persistent hacking. For many, illnesses, often deadly ones, did not reveal themselves for years. Some are battling several ailments simultaneously, from gastrointestinal illness and respiratory disease to an array of rare cancers. James Zadroga, a police officer who worked for more than 450 hours in the debris, developed a cough and later was unable to breathe without an oxygen tank. His death in 2006 was the first to be attributed to exposure to the dust at Ground Zero. It was not the last. More than 100 officers exposed to the hazardous materials have since died. More than 180 firefighters and 15 FBI agents have died from illnesses related to the disaster. According to the VCF&rsquo;s administrator, the fund saw a 235% increase in death claims in 2018 compared with 2015.</p>\n<h2 data-test-id=\"Regwall Headline\">Choose us for news analysis that respects your time and intelligence</h2>\n<p>Get up to <strong>80% off</strong> a quarterly subscription with</p>\n<p><a data-test-id=\"Regwall Subscribe Button\" href=\"https://subscription.economist.com/DE/EngCore/EcomNewArticle/RegwallSub\">View subscription options</a></p>\n<p>Cancel at any time.

Five days later an 8,000lb (3,630kg) piece of steel fell on his foot, crushing it. After nearly dying from infections and losing part of his foot, Mr Feal found out that he was not eligible for financial help for his medical care. He created the Feal Good Foundation and became an advocate for his fellow first responders, travelling with busloads of firefighters and other sick or injured survivors to Washington to urge Congress to pass a bill paying for medical care and monitoring. After years of lobbying, in 2010 Congress passed the James Zadroga September 11 Health and Compensation Act to provide free medical care and create both a health registry and a victim compensation fund (VCF).\nThe need was great. Thousands of first responders and survivors as well as those who worked and lived downtown were not well. When the towers fell a cloud of dust, made up of glass fibres, asbestos, lead, pulverised cement and a host of other carcinogens, was spewed into the air. Some first responders got sick right away, developing \u201cWorld Trade Centre cough\u201d, a persistent hacking. For many, illnesses, often deadly ones, did not reveal themselves for years. Some are battling several ailments simultaneously, from gastrointestinal illness and respiratory disease to an array of rare cancers. James Zadroga, a police officer who worked for more than 450 hours in the debris, developed a cough and later was unable to breathe without an oxygen tank. His death in 2006 was the first to be attributed to exposure to the dust at Ground Zero. It was not the last. More than 100 officers exposed to the hazardous materials have since died. More than 180 firefighters and 15 FBI agents have died from illnesses related to the disaster. According to the VCF\u2019s administrator, the fund saw a 235% increase in death claims in 2018 compared with 2015.\nChoose us for news analysis that respects your time and intelligence\nGet up to 80% off a quarterly subscription with\nView subscription options\nCancel at any time.

Presidents have &ldquo;regularly told Congress to go to hell&rdquo; on such matters, as Harry Truman admiringly noted of his predecessor, James Polk.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump is keeping up that tradition. On April 16th he wielded his veto for only the second time in his presidency to strike down a groundbreaking law that might have forced him to end America&rsquo;s support for the Saudi-led war against the Houthi militia in Yemen.

Facebook ended that in 2017 and 2018.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Gateway Pundit spoke with two of the top conservative publishers in America.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/floyd-brown/\">Floyd Brown</a></strong> is a conservative author, speaker and media commentator. In 2008 Floyd launched <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/\">Western Journal</a> which quickly became one of the top conservative websites in America. By 2016 Floyd&rsquo;s organization of Western Journal and other conservative websites under his umbrella had more than a billion page views. <strong>Since 2016 Floyd&rsquo;s organization lost 75% of its Facebook traffic.</strong></p>\n<p>Likewise, we spoke with <strong>Jared Vallorani</strong> from <a href=\"https://klicked.com/?\"><strong>Klicked Media</strong></a>. Jared traveled to Washington DC with The Gateway Pundit and website owners at <a href=\"https://100percentfedup.com/\">100%FedUp</a> in June to discuss Facebook targeting against conservative publishers with Republican lawmakers. <strong>Jared told The Gateway Pundit his organization Klicked Media, which hosts over 60 conservative websites, lost 400 million page views from Facebook in the last six months if you compare the traffic to a year ago. </strong> Jared said, &ldquo;We lost 70% to 80% of our traffic if you compare January to May 2017 vs Jan to May 2018.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>If you combine the total number of page-views lost by just these two conservative online publishers you are looking at a loss of over 1.5 billion page-views from Facebook in one year.</h3>\n<p><strong>These are numbers from just two of the top conservative publishers in America. This does not include the thousands of other conservative publishers across the country who lost all of their traffic coming from Facebook. Here at The Gateway Pundit our Facebook traffic has been effectively eliminated after we were ranked as the 4th most influential conservative publisher in the 2016 election.</strong></p>\n<p>The fact that Facebook is targeting conservative publishers should not be a surprise to Gateway Pundit readers.</p>\n<p>We have been reporting on this for several months now.

Facebook ended that in 2017 and 2018.\nThe Gateway Pundit spoke with two of the top conservative publishers in America.\nFloyd Brown is a conservative author, speaker and media commentator. In 2008 Floyd launched Western Journal which quickly became one of the top conservative websites in America. By 2016 Floyd\u2019s organization of Western Journal and other conservative websites under his umbrella had more than a billion page views. Since 2016 Floyd\u2019s organization lost 75% of its Facebook traffic.\nLikewise, we spoke with Jared Vallorani from Klicked Media. Jared traveled to Washington DC with The Gateway Pundit and website owners at 100%FedUp in June to discuss Facebook targeting against conservative publishers with Republican lawmakers. Jared told The Gateway Pundit his organization Klicked Media, which hosts over 60 conservative websites, lost 400 million page views from Facebook in the last six months if you compare the traffic to a year ago. Jared said, \u201cWe lost 70% to 80% of our traffic if you compare January to May 2017 vs Jan to May 2018.\u201d\nIf you combine the total number of page-views lost by just these two conservative online publishers you are looking at a loss of over 1.5 billion page-views from Facebook in one year.\nThese are numbers from just two of the top conservative publishers in America. This does not include the thousands of other conservative publishers across the country who lost all of their traffic coming from Facebook. Here at The Gateway Pundit our Facebook traffic has been effectively eliminated after we were ranked as the 4th most influential conservative publisher in the 2016 election.\nThe fact that Facebook is targeting conservative publishers should not be a surprise to Gateway Pundit readers.\nWe have been reporting on this for several months now. In July we released a study where we looked at several top conservative websites and discovered that the publishers had lost an average of 93% of their Facebook traffic.\nThis is a bloodbath. Facebook has wiped out conservative content to American subscribers.\nThis influence map below by Columbia Journalism Review shows the top influencers during the 2016 election.\nAnd here is that same map showing the conservative publishers who have been targeted by Facebook since 2017.\nFacebook has eliminated content from a vast majority of top conservative publishers since 2017.\nOn Wednesday James O\u201dKeefe and Project Veritas published proof from a whistle-blower that Facebook plotted and planned to remove conservative content from their platform.\nThe information describes how Facebook engineers planned and went about policing political speech.\nBREAKING: Facebook Insider Leaks Docs; Explains \"Deboosting,\" \"Troll Report,\" & Political Targeting in Video Interview (FULL \u2013> https://t.co/UdR4D6OkaK) pic.twitter.com/1lQlpvq8sT\n\u2014 James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) February 27, 2019\nIn 2016 suburban voters and women would check their Facebook pages and get conservative news. That is no longer the case.\nFacebook has wiped out conservative publishers. Americans will no longer see articles from conservative websites even if you follow them.\nFacebook took advertising dollars from all of these businesses and then targeted them after the 2016 election.\nFacebook wants to pretend this was not a political decision. Yet, several top liberal activist groups: Media Matters, Share Blue, CREW and American Bridge, made it a priority in early 2017 to work with the liberal tech giants to undermine President Trump and ensure that liberals gain control of Congress and the presidency in 2020.\nThe tech giants did just that.",

He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.</p>\n<p>&hellip;Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation &ndash; only to market himself and to build his wealth and power. Mr. Trump would<br>\n often say, this campaign was going to be the &ldquo;greatest infomercial in political history.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign &ndash; for him &ndash; was always a marketing opportunity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&hellip;A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes.</p>\n<p>As I earlier stated, Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails. In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump&rsquo;s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t that be great.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries &ldquo;shitholes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In private, he is even worse.</p>\n<p>He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;shithole.&rdquo; This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States.</p>\n<p>&hellip;Mr. Trump is a conman.</p>\n<p>He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did. Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets. She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly &ndash; and she did not deserve that.</p>\n<p>I am giving the Committee today a copy of the $130,000 wire transfer from me to Ms. Clifford&rsquo;s attorney during the closing days of the presidential campaign that was demanded by Ms. Clifford to maintain her silence about<br>\n her affair with Mr. Trump. This is Exhibit 4 to my testimony.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign. I did that, too &ndash; without bothering to consider whether that was improper, much less whether it was the right thing to do or how it would impact me, my family, or the public. I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later.</p>\n<p>As Exhibit 5 to my testimony shows, I am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank account on August 1, 2017 &ndash; when he was President of the United States &ndash; pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me &ndash; the word used by Mr. Trump&rsquo;s TV lawyer &mdash; for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf. This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year &ndash; while he was President.</p>\n<p>The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws. You can find the details of that scheme, directed by Mr. Trump, in the pleadings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p>&hellip;When I say conman, I&rsquo;m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, I&rsquo;m giving the Committee today copies of a letter I sent at Mr. Trump&rsquo;s direction threatening these schools with civil and criminal actions if Mr. Trump&rsquo;s grades or SAT scores were ever disclosed without<br>\n his permission. These are Exhibit 6.</p>\n<p>The irony wasn&rsquo;t lost on me at the time that Mr. Trump in 2011 had strongly criticized President Obama for not releasing his grades. As you can see in Exhibit 7, Mr. Trump declared &ldquo;Let him show his records&rdquo; after calling<br>\n President Obama &ldquo;a terrible student.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&hellip;During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he did not consider Vietnam Veteran, and Prisoner of War, Senator John McCain to be &ldquo;a hero&rdquo; because he likes people who weren&rsquo;t captured. At the same time, Mr. Trump tasked me to<br>\n handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment.</p>\n<p>He finished the conversation with the following comment. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m stupid, I wasn&rsquo;t going to Vietnam.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now.</p>\n<p>And yet, I continued to work for him</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions&hellip;</p>\n<p>Over the past year or so, I have done some real soul searching. I see now that my ambition and the intoxication of Trump power had much to do with the bad decisions I made.</p>\n<p>To you, Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, the other members of this Committee, and the other members of the House and Senate, I am sorry for my lies and for lying to Congress.</p>\n<p>To our nation, I am sorry for actively working to hide from you the truth about Mr. Trump when you needed it most.</p>\n<p>For those who question my motives for being here today, I understand. I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your &ldquo;fixer,&rdquo; Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p>And, by coming today, I have caused my family to be the target of personal, scurrilous attacks by the President and his lawyer &ndash; trying to intimidate me from appearing before this panel. Mr. Trump called me a &ldquo;rat&rdquo; for choosing<br>\n to tell the truth &ndash; much like a mobster would do when one of his men decides to cooperate with the government.</p>\n<p>&hellip;I wish to especially thank Speaker Pelosi for her statements in Exhibit 9 to protect this institution and me, and the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Adam Schiff and Chairman Cummings for<br>\n likewise defending this institution and my family against the attacks by Mr. Trump, and also the many Republicans who have admonished the President as well.</p>\n<p>I am not a perfect man. I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. But today, I get to decide the example I set for my children and how I attempt to change how history will remember me. I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people here today.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your attention. I am happy to answer the Committee&rsquo;s questions.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://tempest.services.disqus.com/ads-iframe/google/?position=top&shortname=thegatewaypundit&experiment=network_default&variant=fallthrough&service=dynamic&anchorColor=%231e428a&colorScheme=light&sourceUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegatewaypundit.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fget-trump-democrats-media-go-all-in-on-michael-cohen-broadcast-cable-news-nets-to-air-house-hearing-live-politico-publishes-bombshell-opening-statement%2F&typeface=sans-serif&canonicalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegatewaypundit.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fget-trump-democrats-media-go-all-in-on-michael-cohen-broadcast-cable-news-nets-to-air-house-hearing-live-politico-publishes-bombshell-opening-statement%2F&disqus_version=b016541\"></iframe></figure>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=thegatewaypundit&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegatewaypundit.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fget-trump-democrats-media-go-all-in-on-michael-cohen-broadcast-cable-news-nets-to-air-house-hearing-live-politico-publishes-bombshell-opening-statement%2F&t_d=GET%20TRUMP!%20Democrats%2C%20Media%20Go%20All%20In%20On%20Michael%20Cohen%3A%20Broadcast%2C%20Cable%20News%20Nets%20to%20Air%20House%20Hearing%20Live%3B%20Politico%20Publishes%20'Bombshell'%20Opening%20Statement&t_t=GET%20TRUMP!%20Democrats%2C%20Media%20Go%20All%20In%20On%20Michael%20Cohen%3A%20Broadcast%2C%20Cable%20News%20Nets%20to%20Air%20House%20Hearing%20Live%3B%20Politico%20Publishes%20'Bombshell'%20Opening%20Statement&s_o=default#version=c9a88830014e14db1a266eb16c7bc97b\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "The major broadcast television networks will air live coverage Wednesday of the Democrat-led House Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing with former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen who has turned on his former client since being targeted by federal prosecutors. The cable news networks will also carry the hearing live in which Cohen will reportedly say of President Trump, \u201cHe is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.\u201d\nThe Cohen hearing comes as President Donald Trump is in Vietnam for a crucial summit with North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un\u2013and the day after news broke Cohen was being disbarred for lying as he was testifying behind closed doors before the the Senate Intelligence Committee. Cohen is set to appear Thursday for a closed door session with the House Intelligence Committee.\nVia NBC News:\n\u2026A multipage document filed by Manhattan\u2019s Attorney Grievance Committee that details why Cohen should no longer be permitted to practice in the state of New York was officially entered into the record late Tuesday afternoon.\nIn the state court filing, the Grievance Committee said, \u201cThe Committee contends that respondent was automatically disbarred because respondent\u2019s conviction under 18 USC \u00a7 1001(a)(2) (making false statements to the U.S. Congress), if committed in New York, would constitute the felony of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree.\u201d\nCohen pleaded guilty to eight counts in federal court in August 2018, and then pleaded guilty in November 2018 to lying to Congress. His disbarment is retroactive to his November plea.\nCNN reported on the decision by the broadcast networks.\nThe hearing begins at 10 a.m. Eastern time. Savannah Guthrie and Chuck Todd will anchor live coverage on NBC starting at 9:45 a.m. George Stephanopoulos will lead ABC\u2019s coverage. Norah O\u2019Donnell will anchor on CBS. And Fox News will offer an optional special report to Fox\u2019s broadcast stations.\nThe broadcast networks will roll with the hearing for several hours. The cable newsers will be wall-to-wall\u2026\u201d\nMeanwhile, Politico published Cohen\u2019s prepared opening statement.\nExcerpt:\nCommittee Chairman: And where were you born?\nPentangeli: Par Panico \u2014 it\u2019s outside of Palermo.\nCommittee Chairman: And where do you live now?\nPentangeli: I live in an army barracks with the FBI guys.\nCommittee Chairman: We have here finally a witness that will further testify to Michael Corleone\u2019s rule over a criminal empire that controls all of the gambling in this country and perhaps in other countries. This witness has had no buffer between himself and Michael Corleone. He can corroborate our charges on enough counts for this committee to recommend a charge of perjury against Michael Corleone.\n\u2026Committee Chairman: We have a sworn affidavit \u2014 we have it \u2014 your sworn affidavit that you murdered on the orders of Michael Corleone. Do you deny that confession, and do you realize what will happen as a result of your denial?\nPentangeli: Look, the FBI guys, they promised me a deal. So, so I made up a lot of stuff about Michael Corleone \u2019cause that\u2019s what they wanted. But it was all lies. Uh, everything. And I kept saying Michael Corleone did this and Michael Corleone did that. So, I said yeah sure \u2014 why not?\nSorry, wrong script. Excerpt\u2019s from the Politico version (much more at the link.):\n\u2026I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.\n\u2026Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation \u2013 only to market himself and to build his wealth and power. Mr. Trump would\noften say, this campaign was going to be the \u201cgreatest infomercial in political history.\u201d\nHe never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign \u2013 for him \u2013 was always a marketing opportunity.\u201d\n\u2026A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes.\nAs I earlier stated, Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails. In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump\u2019s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\nMr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of \u201cwouldn\u2019t that be great.\u201d\nMr. Trump is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries \u201cshitholes.\u201d\nIn private, he is even worse.\nHe once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn\u2019t a \u201cshithole.\u201d This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States.\n\u2026Mr. Trump is a conman.\nHe asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did. Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets. She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly \u2013 and she did not deserve that.\nI am giving the Committee today a copy of the $130,000 wire transfer from me to Ms. Clifford\u2019s attorney during the closing days of the presidential campaign that was demanded by Ms. Clifford to maintain her silence about\nher affair with Mr. Trump. This is Exhibit 4 to my testimony.\nMr. Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign. I did that, too \u2013 without bothering to consider whether that was improper, much less whether it was the right thing to do or how it would impact me, my family, or the public. I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later.\nAs Exhibit 5 to my testimony shows, I am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank account on August 1, 2017 \u2013 when he was President of the United States \u2013 pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me \u2013 the word used by Mr. Trump\u2019s TV lawyer \u2014 for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf. This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year \u2013 while he was President.\nThe President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws. You can find the details of that scheme, directed by Mr. Trump, in the pleadings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\u2026When I say conman, I\u2019m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores.\nAs I mentioned, I\u2019m giving the Committee today copies of a letter I sent at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction threatening these schools with civil and criminal actions if Mr. Trump\u2019s grades or SAT scores were ever disclosed without\nhis permission. These are Exhibit 6.\nThe irony wasn\u2019t lost on me at the time that Mr. Trump in 2011 had strongly criticized President Obama for not releasing his grades. As you can see in Exhibit 7, Mr. Trump declared \u201cLet him show his records\u201d after calling\nPresident Obama \u201ca terrible student.\u201d\n\u2026During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he did not consider Vietnam Veteran, and Prisoner of War, Senator John McCain to be \u201ca hero\u201d because he likes people who weren\u2019t captured. At the same time, Mr. Trump tasked me to\nhandle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft.\nMr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment.\nHe finished the conversation with the following comment. \u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid, I wasn\u2019t going to Vietnam.\u201d\nI find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now.\nAnd yet, I continued to work for him\n\u2026\nQuestions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions\u2026\nOver the past year or so, I have done some real soul searching. I see now that my ambition and the intoxication of Trump power had much to do with the bad decisions I made.\nTo you, Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, the other members of this Committee, and the other members of the House and Senate, I am sorry for my lies and for lying to Congress.\nTo our nation, I am sorry for actively working to hide from you the truth about Mr. Trump when you needed it most.\nFor those who question my motives for being here today, I understand. I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your \u201cfixer,\u201d Mr. Trump.\nAnd, by coming today, I have caused my family to be the target of personal, scurrilous attacks by the President and his lawyer \u2013 trying to intimidate me from appearing before this panel. Mr. Trump called me a \u201crat\u201d for choosing\nto tell the truth \u2013 much like a mobster would do when one of his men decides to cooperate with the government.\n\u2026I wish to especially thank Speaker Pelosi for her statements in Exhibit 9 to protect this institution and me, and the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Adam Schiff and Chairman Cummings for\nlikewise defending this institution and my family against the attacks by Mr. Trump, and also the many Republicans who have admonished the President as well.\nI am not a perfect man. I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. But today, I get to decide the example I set for my children and how I attempt to change how history will remember me. I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people here today.\nThank you for your attention. I am happy to answer the Committee\u2019s questions.",

Bret saw an opportunity to make Fox News acceptable enough to the left, so he could get himself a job of hosting the Democratic Debates. Bret supported one of his producers, Hufsa Kamal, in tweeting out a condemnation of Judge Jeanine to put pressure on Fox News to suspend her show. Hufsa Kamal, a producer of Special Report with Bret Baier, has a <a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/03/muslim-fox-news-producer-who-called-out-pirro-has-twitter-account-littered-with-vile-attacks-on-conservatives/\">history of anti-conservative tweets</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Shepard Smith, known as a &ldquo;never-Trumper&rdquo;, also played a major role in the Judge&rsquo;s suspension. &ldquo;He lobbied 24/7 to suspend her.&rdquo;</p> Fox News placed Jerry Andrews, a far-left, anti-conservative as Executive Producer of Justice with Judge Jeanine to &ldquo;muzzle Judge Jeanine from speaking the truth.&rdquo; Andrews has a long history of anti-conservative, anti-Trump social media activity. </blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" src=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/Hufsa-Kamal-Jeanine-Pirro-Twitte-03102019.png\" srcset=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/Hufsa-Kamal-Jeanine-Pirro-Twitte-03102019-330x600.png 330w, https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/Hufsa-Kamal-Jeanine-Pirro-Twitte-03102019.png 446w\"></img></figure>\n<p>Fox News has made no official statement on Pirro&rsquo;s future with the cable network, other than to say it would not comment on &ldquo;internal scheduling matters,&rdquo; as the network <a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/03/report-fox-news-channel-scrubs-scheduled-judge-jeanine-pirro-show-after-ilhan-omar-controversy-mosque-attack/\">abruptly pulled</a> her regularly scheduled Justice with Judge Jeanine show last Saturday night and has apparently<a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/03/fox-news-channel-pulls-justice-with-judge-jeanine-pirro-show-from-next-weekends-schedule/\"> canceled this upcoming Saturday&rsquo;s show</a>. Anonymous sources have filled in TGP and other outlets reputed backstabbing maneuvering against Pirro.</p>\n<p><strong>Fox&rsquo;s silence shows a lack of commitment to return Pirro to the air.</strong></p>\n<p>On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/donna-brazile-why-i-am-excited-to-join-fox-news-and-take-part-in-a-civil-and-sensible-debate\">Fox announced it was hiring</a> former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile as a Fox News Contributor. When she worked for CNN in 2016, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Brazile#Sharing_debate_questions_with_Clinton_campaign\">Brazile was busted</a> for secretly feeding Hillary Clinton debate questions.</p>\n<p>Anonymous sources at Fox relayed to reporters at CNN and the New York Times on Sunday that Pirro has been suspended for two weeks for her comments about Omar and a possible conflict between her adherence to Shariah Law, as represented by her wearing a hijab, and her oath to defend the Constitution. The context of Pirro&rsquo;s comments was the roots of Omar&rsquo;s anti-Semitism and what it means for the future of the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and the Democratic Party.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"> <p>Jeanine Pirro was *suspended* by Fox News after her widely criticized commentary about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IlhanMN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@IlhanMN</a>, according a source familiar with the matter.

                "text": "A source with intimate knowledge of the situation is claiming two Fox News hosts secretly maneuvered to get Judge Jeanine Pirro suspended over her controversial remarks about Muslim Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), with one, Bret Baier, allegedly seeking to curry favor with Democrats to reverse a decision to not allow Fox to host any of the party\u2019s presidential primary debates by getting Fox to suspend Pirro. (Update: Baier denies source\u2019s claim.)\nThe source asked TGP for anonymity to speak freely about the behinds the scenes maneuvers:\nThe original complaint came from Bret Baier\u2019s team. Bret saw an opportunity to make Fox News acceptable enough to the left, so he could get himself a job of hosting the Democratic Debates. Bret supported one of his producers, Hufsa Kamal, in tweeting out a condemnation of Judge Jeanine to put pressure on Fox News to suspend her show. Hufsa Kamal, a producer of Special Report with Bret Baier, has a history of anti-conservative tweets.\nShepard Smith, known as a \u201cnever-Trumper\u201d, also played a major role in the Judge\u2019s suspension. \u201cHe lobbied 24/7 to suspend her.\u201d\nFox News placed Jerry Andrews, a far-left, anti-conservative as Executive Producer of Justice with Judge Jeanine to \u201cmuzzle Judge Jeanine from speaking the truth.\u201d Andrews has a long history of anti-conservative, anti-Trump social media activity.\nFox News has made no official statement on Pirro\u2019s future with the cable network, other than to say it would not comment on \u201cinternal scheduling matters,\u201d as the network abruptly pulled her regularly scheduled Justice with Judge Jeanine show last Saturday night and has apparently canceled this upcoming Saturday\u2019s show. Anonymous sources have filled in TGP and other outlets reputed backstabbing maneuvering against Pirro.\nFox\u2019s silence shows a lack of commitment to return Pirro to the air.\nOn Monday, Fox announced it was hiring former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile as a Fox News Contributor. When she worked for CNN in 2016, Brazile was busted for secretly feeding Hillary Clinton debate questions.\nAnonymous sources at Fox relayed to reporters at CNN and the New York Times on Sunday that Pirro has been suspended for two weeks for her comments about Omar and a possible conflict between her adherence to Shariah Law, as represented by her wearing a hijab, and her oath to defend the Constitution. The context of Pirro\u2019s comments was the roots of Omar\u2019s anti-Semitism and what it means for the future of the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and the Democratic Party.\nJeanine Pirro was *suspended* by Fox News after her widely criticized commentary about @IlhanMN, according a source familiar with the matter. It's unclear how long the suspension will last. Fox declined to confirm or deny this. https://t.co/pp2Rn3QYb5\n\u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) March 17, 2019\nNYT matches my reporting from earlier today: Fox's Jeanine Pirro \"has been formally suspended by the network because of her remarks, according to a person told of the decision\u2026\" https://t.co/yC5AAx1r1j\n\u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) March 18, 2019\nPirro has not spoken out publicly about the controversy since Sunday, March 10, when Fox issued a statement condemning her remarks and simultaneously issued a statement from Pirro explaining her comments.\nMore anonymous sources are now filling the void with reports that Pirro is being targeted by liberals at Fox News.\nThe Hollywood Reporter on Monday quoted a source close to Fox saying executives have never liked Pirro, to explain why the network stood by fellow opinion host Tucker Carlson who has also been under fire\u2013but for remarks he made a decade ago on talk radio.\nFox News was quick to condemn Pirro\u2019s remarks but has not criticized Carlson\u2019s comments, some of which were made when he was an MSNBC employee. A source familiar with the network\u2019s strategy explained the divergent approach: \u201cThey love Tucker. They do not like Jeanine Pirro. They never have.\u201d",

In fact, we have always welcomed people who have faced tremendous hardships around the world. Immigrants and refugees are part of Seattle&rsquo;s heritage, and they will continue to make us the city of the future.</p> <p data-elm-loc=\"3\">What does scare us? A president and federal government that would seek to weaponize a law enforcement agency to punish perceived political enemies. A would-be despot who thinks the rule of law does not apply to him.</p> <p data-elm-loc=\"3\">It&rsquo;s clear he hates the fact that the very cities he scorns are engines of innovation, opportunity and economic power. But we will not be deterred. The president&rsquo;s threats won&rsquo;t intimidate me as a mayor of a city with an open door, as a former federal prosecutor or as the granddaughter of a teenager who fled a war-torn, starving and impoverished country only to be welcomed in America.</p> <p data-elm-loc=\"3\">In Seattle, we have started to provide tuition-free college for our public high school graduates, regardless of a young person&rsquo;s immigration status.

In fact, we have always welcomed people who have faced tremendous hardships around the world. Immigrants and refugees are part of Seattle\u2019s heritage, and they will continue to make us the city of the future.\nWhat does scare us? A president and federal government that would seek to weaponize a law enforcement agency to punish perceived political enemies. A would-be despot who thinks the rule of law does not apply to him.\nIt\u2019s clear he hates the fact that the very cities he scorns are engines of innovation, opportunity and economic power. But we will not be deterred. The president\u2019s threats won\u2019t intimidate me as a mayor of a city with an open door, as a former federal prosecutor or as the granddaughter of a teenager who fled a war-torn, starving and impoverished country only to be welcomed in America.\nIn Seattle, we have started to provide tuition-free college for our public high school graduates, regardless of a young person\u2019s immigration status. We\u2019re expanding internship and apprenticeship opportunities to connect all our young people with the jobs and opportunities of the future. We\u2019re working to help tens of thousands of legal permanent residents become U.S. citizens as part of the New Citizen Campaign and our other citizenship programs. Our Ready to Work program connects people with case managers and English language education to help our immigrant and refugee neighbors gain the skills necessary to enter our booming jobs market.\nSo if this president wants to send immigrants and refugees to Seattle and other welcoming cities, let me be clear: We will do what we have always done, and we will be stronger for it. And it will only strengthen our commitment to fighting for the dignity of every person. We will not allow any administration to use the power of America to destroy the promise of America.\nShe appeared on MSNBC\u2019s Hardball with Chris Matthews to double down.\nIf this president wants to send immigrants and refugees to Seattle, we will do what we have always done: welcome them.\nAs I said tonight on @hardball, we won't let this president use the power of America to destroy the promise of America. pic.twitter.com/9ihSbMI6cF\n\u2014 Mayor Jenny Durkan (@MayorJenny) April 16, 2019\nJason Rantz, of My Northwest, points out how Durkan is contradicting herself and even insulting the very same immigrants she purports to care so deeply about:\nDurkan\u2019s editorial manages the kind of doublespeak you expect from a politician who picks virtue signaling over sound policy.

I don\u2019t need your approval.\nNot to mention, she would \u2014 and likely has \u2014 described every other demographic group in Seattle in the same way.\nMy favorite part of Durkan\u2019s piece is when she tells Trump that his administration can learn from her own. She left out all the damning statistics of homelessness, traffic congestion, property crime, rape, robbery, and murder all trending in the wrong direction under her watch.\nYes, this is the same city whose homeless and drug crisis is reaching peak liberal and has been the subject of a critically acclaimed documentary, Seattle Is Dying.\nWhile Durkan encourages everyone to take in illegal aliens, she seems to not care half an iota about the homeless citizens who are suffering on the streets in the city that she rules over.\nShe\u2019s joined by Burlington, VT, Mayor Miro Weinberger, who is also hoping that his city gets a metric ton of cultural diversity via throngs of illegal aliens.",

But it remained unclear if enough Republicans, who have been reticent to take on the president, would be willing to issue a direct challenge of his authority.</p>\n<p>Although they expected some to break ranks and join Democrats in supporting the resolution, Republican leaders said they did not anticipate the measure would earn a veto-proof majority.</p>\n<p>Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill that the issue was not about partisanship, but a question of &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We would be delinquent in our duties if we did not resist, if we did not fight back to overturn the president&rsquo;s declaration,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s emergency declaration has separately been hit with several lawsuits, including one filed last week by the attorneys general of 16 states. At the center of most of the legal arguments is the president&rsquo;s move to circumvent Congress and reallocate funding toward a border wall against the will of federal lawmakers.</p>\n<aside data-component=\"rich-link\" data-link-name=\"rich-link-1 | 1\">    <h2>Trump&rsquo;s emergency: the arbitrary action of an instinctive autocrat | Simon Tisdall</h2>     Read more      </aside>\n<p>The concerns were echoed by 58 former national security officials, who released an open letter on Monday denouncing Trump&rsquo;s declaration.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Under no plausible assessment of the evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles the president to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a wall at the southern border,&rdquo; the officials wrote.</p>\n<p>The signatories included former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former defense secretary Chuck Hagel, who served in Barack Obama&rsquo;s administration, as well as Eliot Cohen, the state department counselor under George W Bush, and George HW Bush&rsquo;s ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas Pickering.</p>\n<p>Trump meanwhile urged members of his party to hold the line, tweeting on Monday: &ldquo;I hope our great Republican senators don&rsquo;t get led down the path of weak and ineffective border security.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Without strong borders, we don&rsquo;t have a country &ndash; and the voters are on board with us,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Be strong and smart, don&rsquo;t fall into the Democrats&rsquo; &lsquo;trap&rsquo; of open borders and crime!&rdquo;</p>\n<figure data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1100017237228949506\"><blockquote> Donald J.

                "text": "The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has advanced a resolution to terminate Donald Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration at the US-Mexico border, in an attempt to block the president from beginning construction on a border wall without approval from Congress.\nIn a vote of 245-182, the House easily passed the measure.\nThirteen Republicans joined Democrats in moving to revoke Trump\u2019s executive order, which he signed earlier this month after US lawmakers refused to authorize his request for $5.7bn in funding toward a border wall during negotiations on government spending.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about the border,\u201d the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said. \u201cThis is about the constitution.\u201d\nThe resolution will now face a vote in the Republican-led Senate, where only a handful of defections are needed for it to pass in what would mark a major rebuke of the president. Trump has vowed to veto the measure if it reaches his desk.\nAt least one key Senate Republican, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said she would support the resolution to block Trump\u2019s emergency declaration.\n\u201cI have been concerned, whenever any president, Republican or Democrat, moves beyond what most would consider to be their authorities,\u201d she said.\nPlay Video\n1:43\nTwo other Republican senators, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine, are expected to vote against Trump\u2019s order.\nSeveral other Republicans were critical of Trump\u2019s decision to declare an emergency, arguing it set a dangerous precedent that challenged Congress\u2019s power of the purse. But it remained unclear if enough Republicans, who have been reticent to take on the president, would be willing to issue a direct challenge of his authority.\nAlthough they expected some to break ranks and join Democrats in supporting the resolution, Republican leaders said they did not anticipate the measure would earn a veto-proof majority.\nPelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill that the issue was not about partisanship, but a question of \u201cpatriotism\u201d.\n\u201cWe would be delinquent in our duties if we did not resist, if we did not fight back to overturn the president\u2019s declaration,\u201d she said.\nTrump\u2019s emergency declaration has separately been hit with several lawsuits, including one filed last week by the attorneys general of 16 states. At the center of most of the legal arguments is the president\u2019s move to circumvent Congress and reallocate funding toward a border wall against the will of federal lawmakers.\nTrump\u2019s emergency: the arbitrary action of an instinctive autocrat | Simon Tisdall\nRead more\nThe concerns were echoed by 58 former national security officials, who released an open letter on Monday denouncing Trump\u2019s declaration.\n\u201cUnder no plausible assessment of the evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles the president to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a wall at the southern border,\u201d the officials wrote.\nThe signatories included former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former defense secretary Chuck Hagel, who served in Barack Obama\u2019s administration, as well as Eliot Cohen, the state department counselor under George W Bush, and George HW Bush\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas Pickering.\nTrump meanwhile urged members of his party to hold the line, tweeting on Monday: \u201cI hope our great Republican senators don\u2019t get led down the path of weak and ineffective border security.\u201d\n\u201cWithout strong borders, we don\u2019t have a country \u2013 and the voters are on board with us,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBe strong and smart, don\u2019t fall into the Democrats\u2019 \u2018trap\u2019 of open borders and crime!\u201d\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\nI hope our great Republican Senators don\u2019t get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security. Without strong Borders, we don\u2019t have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don\u2019t fall into the Democrats \u201ctrap\u201d of Open Borders and Crime!\nFebruary 25, 2019\nFew promises are as symbolic of Trump\u2019s agenda as building a wall along the south-west US border. Despite his longtime insistence that Mexico would pay for the wall, Trump has repeatedly called on Congress to fund the project and in December led the country into a 35-day shutdown when Democrats rebuffed his demands.\nThe shutdown \u2013 which marked the third of Trump\u2019s presidency and the longest in US history \u2013 ended with the president receiving zero funding for a border wall. Earlier this month, Congress passed a spending bill that allocated nearly $1.4bn toward the construction of a physical barrier but was well short of the $5.7bn Trump had requested.",

Mr Trump put Mr Stone on the speakerphone,\u201d Cohen\u2019s opening statement reads.\n\u201cMr Stone told Mr Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr Assange told Mr Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr Trump responded by stating to the effect of \u2018wouldn\u2019t that be great.\u2019\u201d\nProfile\nWho is Michael Cohen?\nShow Hide\nMichael Cohen was a lawyer for Donald Trump from 2006 until 2018. He was a vice-president of The Trump Organization, and was part of Trump\u2019s campaign team for the 2016 presidential election. Considered a close friend and confidant of the US president, Cohen faced criminal charges for his work for Trump.\nIn August 2018 Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud, and bank fraud, admitting that on the eve of the 2016 presidential election he made a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, and arranged for a $150,000 payment to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\nCohen also admitted lying during campaign about a Trump property deal in Russia. He is one of of five of Trump\u2019s presidential aides to have been found to have broken the law.\nHe was sentenced to three years in prison in December 2018, and was also ordered to pay nearly $2m in fines and restitution requirements.\nHaving previously described himself as \u201cthe guy who would take a bullet for the president\u201d, when sentenced, Cohen said \u201cI have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired. I know now, in fact, there is little to be admired.\u201d\nThe 52 year old is married with two children, and has, over the years flipped between being a member of both the Democrats and the Republicans. He is expected to report to jail in May 2019.\nMartin Belam\nPhotograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/X90035\nWas this helpful?\nThank you for your feedback.\n\u201cMr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates,\u201d he will add.\nTrump hit back from Hanoi, where he is attending a summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.\n\u201cMichael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also,\u201d Trump tweeted.\u201cHe was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time,\u201d Trump wrote.\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\nMichael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crooked\u2019s lawyer!\nFebruary 27, 2019\nIn his statement, Cohen also suggest his instructions to lie to Congress about a possible Trump Tower deal in Moscow during the 2016 campaign came from the president \u2013 albeit not directly.\n\u201cIn conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there\u2019s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing,\u201d Cohen will say. \u201cIn his way, he was telling me to lie.\u201d\n\u201cMr Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates,\u201d he will add.\nCohen will also tell the committee he believes Trump is a \u201cracist\u201d.\n\u201cThe country has seen Mr Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries \u2018shitholes\u2019,\u201d he will say, according to the testimony. \u201cIn private, he is even worse.\u201d\nHe is set to provide the committee with copies of the wire transfer he made to the porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, during the closing days of the presidential campaign and of a $35,000 check dated 1 August 2017 that Cohen alleges he received from Trump to reimburse him for those efforts.\n\u201cThe President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws,\u201d Cohen is expected to allege.\nCohen is also expected to depict Trump as an opportunist. \u201cHe never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign \u2013 for him \u2013 was always a marketing opportunity,\u201d Cohen writes in the opening statement.\nCohen\u2019s public testimony comes one day after he was interviewed under oath by the Senate intelligence committee in the first of three congressional appearances this week.\nCohen, who once said he would \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for Trump but has since turned against his former boss, appeared before the Senate panel in a closed session on Tuesday.\nGet a new perspective on the US. Sign up for the morning briefing\nRead more\nCohen will be testifying under penalty of perjury but will probably be met with skepticism from Republicans who will seek to draw attention to a track record of dishonesty.\nTensions rose ahead of the long-awaited session, when Trump ally Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman from Florida, appeared to threaten Cohen on Twitter.\n\u201cHey @MichaelCohen212 - Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends?\u201d he tweeted. \u201cMaybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she\u2019ll remain faithful when you\u2019re in prison. She\u2019s about to learn a lot \u2026\u201d\nHe later deleted the tweet and apologized.\nThe White House earlier sought to discredit Cohen before the hearings began.\nThe White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, issued a statement saying he was \u201cgoing to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements\u201d.\nSanders said it was \u201claughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies\u201d.\nCohen was sentenced to 36 months in prison in December for crimes including lying to Congress about Trump\u2019s business dealings with Russia, and facilitating illegal payments. Cohen is set to surrender on 6 May to begin his sentence, as ordered by a federal judge.\nIn his guilty plea, Cohen said: \u201cI made these misstatements to be consistent with Individual 1\u2019s political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual 1.\u201d Individual 1 was a reference to Trump.\nTrump denies the allegations and says Cohen lied to get a lighter sentence.\nCohen also plans to tell US lawmakers are likely to hear Cohen testify that Trump asked him several times about a proposed skyscraper project in Moscow long after he secured the Republican presidential nomination.\nCohen\u2019s assertion that Trump was inquiring about the project as late as June 2016, if true, would show Trump remained personally interested in a business venture in Russia well into his candidacy.\nTrump faces a legal reckoning \u2013 but are his worst troubles yet to come?\nRead more\nOn 29 November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress by telling lawmakers in 2017 that all efforts relating to the Moscow project had ceased by January 2016. In fact, Cohen said, those efforts continued until June 2016.\nTrump has repeatedly denied any collusion took place between his campaign and Moscow.\nCohen\u2019s week of interviews come as House Democrats launch multiple investigations into Trump\u2019s ties to Russia and conflict-of-interest issues within the administration. House Republicans in the last Congress investigated whether Trump\u2019s campaign coordinated with Russia, but ended that inquiry over Democratic objections, saying that there was no evidence that they did so. The Senate\u2019s Russia investigation continues.\nAssociated Press and Reuters contributed to this article",

Cohen, one of Trump&rsquo;s closest advisers for a decade, was known to have been paid in 2017 for consulting work by a state-controlled South Korean aviation company and a bank in Kazakhstan.</p>\n<p>The filings said Mueller&rsquo;s investigators were looking in Cohen&rsquo;s Gmail account for records on any &ldquo;funds or benefits&rdquo; he received from foreign governments or companies, as well as any files revealing efforts by Cohen to work on their behalf.</p>\n<p>The court documents were released by a federal judge in New York, where Cohen <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/michael-cohen-pleads-guilty-manhattan-federal-court-eight-counts-including-criminal-tax\">pleaded guilty</a> last year to campaign finance and personal financial crimes.

Some legal analysts have said Trump could be vulnerable to prosecution for the scheme once he leaves office.

Mueller was asked to look into any connections or coordination between <a data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> and Trump&rsquo;s team.</p>\n<p>They showed search warrants obtained for Cohen&rsquo;s email accounts gave investigators sweeping authority to look into related data including Cohen&rsquo;s calendars, contacts and photographs. Investigators were also given permission to use Cohen&rsquo;s fingers or face to unlock his electronic devices if necessary.</p>\n<p>Following their successful July 2017 application, Mueller&rsquo;s team secured several more warrants for Cohen. They were granted a search warrant for Cohen&rsquo;s Apple iCloud account on 8 August 2017, the filings said, and then obtained two more search warrants in November 2017 for two additional email accounts used by Cohen.</p>\n<p>Mueller&rsquo;s team passed some of its findings, which did not relate to their central investigation, up to justice department colleagues in New York. After prosecutors there were granted further warrants, FBI agents raided Cohen&rsquo;s home, hotel room and storage facility and seized millions of documents.</p>\n<p>Mueller&rsquo;s investigation, which <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/25/robert-mueller-donald-trump-russia-investigation\">appears to be drawing to a conclusion</a>, has roiled Trump&rsquo;s first term in office and led to the criminal convictions of a series of former Trump advisers for financial crimes and lying to investigators.</p>\n<p>It has also led to the indictment of more than two dozen Russians for interfering in the 2016 US election campaign, but no one from Trump&rsquo;s campaign has been charged over activity relating to the election campaign.</p>\n<p>Paul Manafort, Trump&rsquo;s former campaign chairman, has been accused by Mueller of sharing private polling data with a colleague accused of having ties to Russian intelligence services.</p>",

Cohen, one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers for a decade, was known to have been paid in 2017 for consulting work by a state-controlled South Korean aviation company and a bank in Kazakhstan.\nThe filings said Mueller\u2019s investigators were looking in Cohen\u2019s Gmail account for records on any \u201cfunds or benefits\u201d he received from foreign governments or companies, as well as any files revealing efforts by Cohen to work on their behalf.\nThe court documents were released by a federal judge in New York, where Cohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance and personal financial crimes. They were originally filed by investigators in April last year to obtain additional search warrants.\nIt was not previously known that Cohen was suspected of crimes relating to representing foreigners without registering with US authorities, and no such charges were brought against him. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison and is due to be jailed in May.\nThe filings released on Tuesday ran to hundreds of pages. More than 19 pages, apparently relating to the campaign finance scheme, were entirely blacked out, indicating that it remains under investigation.\nCohen directly implicated Trump in the scheme, which involved hush-money payments to women who alleged during the 2016 campaign that they had affairs with Trump. Some legal analysts have said Trump could be vulnerable to prosecution for the scheme once he leaves office. He denies breaking any laws.\nThe documents released on Tuesday gave a rare insight on the early actions taken by Mueller\u2019s office in the weeks after his appointment as special counsel on 17 May 2017, following the president\u2019s firing of James Comey, the FBI director. Mueller was asked to look into any connections or coordination between Russia and Trump\u2019s team.\nThey showed search warrants obtained for Cohen\u2019s email accounts gave investigators sweeping authority to look into related data including Cohen\u2019s calendars, contacts and photographs. Investigators were also given permission to use Cohen\u2019s fingers or face to unlock his electronic devices if necessary.\nFollowing their successful July 2017 application, Mueller\u2019s team secured several more warrants for Cohen. They were granted a search warrant for Cohen\u2019s Apple iCloud account on 8 August 2017, the filings said, and then obtained two more search warrants in November 2017 for two additional email accounts used by Cohen.\nMueller\u2019s team passed some of its findings, which did not relate to their central investigation, up to justice department colleagues in New York. After prosecutors there were granted further warrants, FBI agents raided Cohen\u2019s home, hotel room and storage facility and seized millions of documents.\nMueller\u2019s investigation, which appears to be drawing to a conclusion, has roiled Trump\u2019s first term in office and led to the criminal convictions of a series of former Trump advisers for financial crimes and lying to investigators.\nIt has also led to the indictment of more than two dozen Russians for interfering in the 2016 US election campaign, but no one from Trump\u2019s campaign has been charged over activity relating to the election campaign.\nPaul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, has been accused by Mueller of sharing private polling data with a colleague accused of having ties to Russian intelligence services.",

The crack is spreading to the east. This rift, known as the Halloween crack, is set to intersect with another fissure that was apparently stable for the past 35 years but is now accelerating north at a rate of around 2.5 miles a year.</p>\n<p>Once these two rifts meet, which could happen within weeks, an iceberg of at least 660sq miles is set to be loosened.</p>\n<p>This process, also known as calving, occurs naturally with ice shelves but &ldquo;recent changes are unfamiliar in this area&rdquo; and could lead to the destabilization of the Brunt ice shelf, Nasa warned.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The likely future loss of the ice on the other side of the Halloween Crack suggests that more instability is possible,&rdquo; said Chris Shuman, a glaciologist with Nasa and the University of Maryland Baltimore County.</p>\n<p>While the anticipated iceberg is large by most measures, it is dwarfed by other recent Antarctic breakaways. In July 2017, one of the largest ever icebergs calved from the Larsen C ice shelf. At 2,200sq miles it was nearly twice the size of the US state of Delaware.</p>\n<p>The long-term future of Antarctic ice shelves will have a major influence on sea level rise around the world. <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/13/antarctic-ice-melting-faster-than-ever-studies-show\">A report released by US and UK scientists last year</a> stated that ice in Antarctica is melting at a record-breaking rate, posing a major threat to coastal cities.</p>\n<p>The study found that melting of the ice sheet has accelerated threefold in the last five years. Unless drastic action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming, scientists estimate that Antarctica&rsquo;s melting ice should add more than 25cm to total global sea level rise by 2070.</p>",

                "text": "An iceberg roughly twice the size of New York City is set to break away from an Antarctic ice shelf as a result of a rapidly spreading rift that is being monitored by Nasa.\nA crack along part of the Brunt ice shelf in Antarctica first appeared in October 2016, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa). The crack is spreading to the east. This rift, known as the Halloween crack, is set to intersect with another fissure that was apparently stable for the past 35 years but is now accelerating north at a rate of around 2.5 miles a year.\nOnce these two rifts meet, which could happen within weeks, an iceberg of at least 660sq miles is set to be loosened.\nThis process, also known as calving, occurs naturally with ice shelves but \u201crecent changes are unfamiliar in this area\u201d and could lead to the destabilization of the Brunt ice shelf, Nasa warned.\n\u201cThe likely future loss of the ice on the other side of the Halloween Crack suggests that more instability is possible,\u201d said Chris Shuman, a glaciologist with Nasa and the University of Maryland Baltimore County.\nWhile the anticipated iceberg is large by most measures, it is dwarfed by other recent Antarctic breakaways. In July 2017, one of the largest ever icebergs calved from the Larsen C ice shelf. At 2,200sq miles it was nearly twice the size of the US state of Delaware.\nThe long-term future of Antarctic ice shelves will have a major influence on sea level rise around the world. A report released by US and UK scientists last year stated that ice in Antarctica is melting at a record-breaking rate, posing a major threat to coastal cities.\nThe study found that melting of the ice sheet has accelerated threefold in the last five years. Unless drastic action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming, scientists estimate that Antarctica\u2019s melting ice should add more than 25cm to total global sea level rise by 2070.",
