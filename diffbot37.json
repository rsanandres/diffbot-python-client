You have to be fast. And you have to feel comfortable with the categories if you want to succeed.&rdquo; He nodded toward the previous night&rsquo;s winner, Alex Koral, who beamed. &ldquo;All of those three worked for Alex yesterday. Who will they work for today?&rdquo; Trebek asked.</p>\n<p>The answer, unfortunately for Alex, was the guy to his left: James Holzhauer, the frighteningly talented &ldquo;Jeopardy!&rdquo; player who has dominated the past 14 games and racked up $1,061,554, second only to Ken Jennings. In its 35th season, the dinnertime show is suddenly appointment television as Holzhauer has shattered the idea of a typical &ldquo;Jeopardy!&rdquo; strategy. He now holds the record for the five highest single-game winnings in the show&rsquo;s history; his highest total is $131,137, which he won last week. Holzhauer plays, <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/jeopardy-james-holzhauer-champion-strategy-ken-jennings.html\">as Slate put it</a>, &ldquo;like a cyborg constructed for the express purpose of winning at this ever-popular game.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Unless you have been living under a rock for the past two weeks, you know about our current champion, James,&rdquo; Trebek said Monday evening, as Holzhauer crushed his fellow competitors by tens of thousands of dollars. &ldquo;Now, it is worth noting that when Ken Jennings had his amazing run of 74 wins in a row, he was averaging $34,000 per victory. James is averaging $71,000 per victory.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As a professional sports gambler from Las Vegas, Holzhauer appears to have absolutely no fear of making huge bets during the Daily Double or Final Jeopardy. He hunts around the board to find the Daily Double before anyone else has a shot. He has developed excellent buzzer strategy, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/06/02/jeopardy-behind-the-scenes-7-things-i-learned-auditioning-for-americas-favorite-quiz-show/?utm_term=.f30975b707f9&tid=lk_inline_manual_8\">which is a key component.</a> He also goes for the $1,000 or $2,000 clues instead of starting at the beginning of each category, which Jennings (who won $2.5 million in 2004) said is a huge factor in Holzhauer&rsquo;s success.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s honestly one of the smartest things James is doing, going for the high dollar values early,&rdquo; Jennings <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ken-jennings-james-holzhauer-jeopardy/\">told Wired</a>. &ldquo;Not just because it enables bigger wagers, but because he&rsquo;s taking money off the board while he&rsquo;s the most comfortable player, and everybody else is still finding their legs.

(A spokeswoman for &ldquo;Jeopardy!&rdquo; said producers do not comment on individual contestants while their episodes are still running.) At the moment, he seems unbeatable, but taking high-risk bets could eventually catch up to him.

Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet with their Chinese counterparts, a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss undisclosed travel plans.</p>\n<p>White House officials had hoped that President Trump would be able to host Chinese President Xi Jinping by the end of this month so that the two countries could announce a formal accord, but talks have bogged down over disagreements about how to enforce a new deal and Trump&rsquo;s demand for far-reaching changes in China&rsquo;s state-led economic system.</p>\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s possible that the two leaders will not meet until April or even later. Deadlines keep moving. Trump had originally given Chinese negotiators until March 1 to finalize the terms of the deal, or he threatened to raise tariffs on billions of dollars in imports. But he backed down from that threat several weeks ago, declaring that he thought there was progress and that more time was needed.</p>\n<p>During the 2016 campaign, Trump attacked the Chinese government, accusing it of using unfair currency and trade rules to rip off U.S. companies and consumers. He said that because the United States imports more goods from China than it exports, it creates an unfair imbalance that must be remedied.</p>\n<p>He has placed tariffs on imports of about $250 billion in Chinese goods to try to force Chinese officials to negotiate, and the strategy has worked &mdash; last year, Xi agreed to begin formal discussions with Trump on a broad trade deal.</p>\n<p>Trump and other White House officials have said they are making progress, particularly in areas related to currency manipulation and intellectual property theft. They also have said that Chinese leaders agreed to increase purchases of U.S. energy and agricultural products. But they have not released specifics about the pact, making it hard to judge the scope of any deal.</p>\n<p>Asked about the status of the China talks, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said that both countries were trying to work through difficult issues and that the Trump administration was happy to take its time to reach an agreement that Trump likes.</p>",

But he backed down from that threat several weeks ago, declaring that he thought there was progress and that more time was needed.\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump attacked the Chinese government, accusing it of using unfair currency and trade rules to rip off U.S. companies and consumers. He said that because the United States imports more goods from China than it exports, it creates an unfair imbalance that must be remedied.\nHe has placed tariffs on imports of about $250 billion in Chinese goods to try to force Chinese officials to negotiate, and the strategy has worked \u2014 last year, Xi agreed to begin formal discussions with Trump on a broad trade deal.\nTrump and other White House officials have said they are making progress, particularly in areas related to currency manipulation and intellectual property theft. They also have said that Chinese leaders agreed to increase purchases of U.S. energy and agricultural products. But they have not released specifics about the pact, making it hard to judge the scope of any deal.\nAsked about the status of the China talks, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said that both countries were trying to work through difficult issues and that the Trump administration was happy to take its time to reach an agreement that Trump likes.",

                "html": "<p>If there&rsquo;s a single phrase that sums up the guiding principle of the Marvel Cinematic Universe &mdash; the interdependent series of superhero movies that, with the arrival of this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;Avengers: Endgame,&rdquo; now numbers 22 films &mdash; it&rsquo;s this: Hold that thought. (Truth be told, with &ldquo;Endgame&rsquo;s&rdquo; running time of three hours, &ldquo;hold that bladder&rdquo; would also apply.)</p>\n<p>As the stories unfolded, beginning with &ldquo;Iron Man,&rdquo; starring Robert Downey Jr., in 2008, and introducing additional characters along the way &mdash; Thor, Black Widow, Black Panther and many others &mdash; it has become increasingly necessary not only to retain details of the labyrinthine plots but to keep a soft spot in your heart for the protagonists, from movie to movie. To be sure, as the MCU has evolved, growing into an epic that can be, at times, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/entertainment/avengers-infinity-war-mcu-timeline/?utm_term=.adde61c0f733\">confusing</a>, a through line has coalesced around a group of inanimate objects: six powerful Infinity Stones whose scattered locations have shifted from planet to planet and from person to person, like a cosmic shell game, as the movies came and went.</p>\n<p>But it was always the lives of the people on screen that mattered most.</p>\n<p>As even casual fans will remember, those stones ended up in the wrong hands at the end of the last Avengers movie, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/avengers-infinity-war-is-stunningly-dark-but-its-still-wildly-entertaining/2018/04/24/6de7aefc-4291-11e8-ad8f-27a8c409298b_story.html?utm_term=.2955e3983bb2\">Infinity War</a>.&rdquo; That 2018 film ended with a cliffhanger in which the villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) snapped his fingers, with cataclysmic consequences for many of the heroes we have come to know and, yes, love.</p>\n<p>The results of Thanos&rsquo;s simple yet devastating gesture, which some wags have taken to calling the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/04/30/607093337/ok-lets-talk-about-the-ending-of-avengers-infinity-war\">Snapture</a>,&rdquo; were memorably shocking. But not as indelible as the shadow that crept across his face just before the closing credits: the enigmatic half-smile &mdash; midway between regret and relief &mdash; of a psychopathic, purple Mona Lisa.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s helpful, before going to see &ldquo;Endgame,&rdquo; to cast your mind back to the contradictory feelings of that final scene. The new movie, which centers on the efforts of Captain America (Chris Evans) and the remaining Avengers to implement a do-over &mdash; essentially rewinding the effects of Thanos&rsquo;s snap &mdash; feels at once sad and deeply satisfying, complicated and surprisingly comic. If many of us have grown up with the MCU, the films themselves have also grown more complex, like a fine wine.</p>\n<p>Too much? Probably. Would you believe a well-aged cheese?</p>\n<p>This is, let us not forget, a comic-book movie, with starkly drawn lines of good and evil, and unapologetically reductive storytelling. But amid all the action and the derring-do, between the hooey and the hokum, there&rsquo;s room for real emotion.</p>\n<p>So how do Cap and the gang mean to fix things? If you remember last year&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ant-Man and the Wasp,&rdquo; that film ended with Paul Rudd&rsquo;s shrinkable Ant-Man trapped in the Quantum Realm, a subatomic state where the laws of space and time don&rsquo;t apply. Well, Ant-Man is back &mdash; it&rsquo;s no spoiler; he&rsquo;s in the trailer &mdash; and he&rsquo;s brought with him an idea for what he calls a &ldquo;time heist,&rdquo; combining two of filmdom&rsquo;s most wildly entertaining genres: time travel and the crime caper. The details of the plan should best not be spelled out, but they entail our heroes revisiting destinations that will be familiar from earlier films &mdash; New York City, the Norse celestial plain of Asgard and the planets Morag and Vormir &mdash; as well as the action of those films themselves, including &ldquo;Thor: The Dark World&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Avengers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In a sense, &ldquo;Endgame&rdquo; is an example of the MCU cannibalizing itself, but it has always done so. And it does so here in a fresh way that is closer to homage than lazy appropriation. These affectionate flashbacks also serve as a tip of the hat to all the loyal fans who have held this sprawling mythology so dear.</p>\n<p>As high as the stakes are in &ldquo;Endgame,&rdquo; it is also a very funny movie. The humor of the story &mdash; some of which takes place in the future, five years after the end of &ldquo;Infinity War&rdquo; &mdash; has to do with surprising ways in which the lives of certain characters have changed (along with their personalities and, in some cases, their physiques).</p>\n<p>As far as holding a thought is concerned, the characters at the center of &ldquo;Endgame&rdquo; &mdash; most prominently Captain America and Iron Man &mdash; have always been stubbornly monomaniacal, to a fault. On the K&uuml;bler-Ross cycle of grief, as &ldquo;Endgame&rdquo; gets underway, they&rsquo;re still stuck in Stage 1: denial. Thanos puts it this way: &ldquo;You could not live with your own failure.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If &ldquo;Infinity War&rdquo; was about failure, &ldquo;Endgame&rdquo; is, ironically, all about acceptance and moving on. After 11 long years, the Infinity Saga is finally, fulfillingly over. There is no post-credit scene. But oh, what a going-away party these old friends have thrown for themselves.</p>",

                "text": "If there\u2019s a single phrase that sums up the guiding principle of the Marvel Cinematic Universe \u2014 the interdependent series of superhero movies that, with the arrival of this week\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d now numbers 22 films \u2014 it\u2019s this: Hold that thought. (Truth be told, with \u201cEndgame\u2019s\u201d running time of three hours, \u201chold that bladder\u201d would also apply.)\nAs the stories unfolded, beginning with \u201cIron Man,\u201d starring Robert Downey Jr., in 2008, and introducing additional characters along the way \u2014 Thor, Black Widow, Black Panther and many others \u2014 it has become increasingly necessary not only to retain details of the labyrinthine plots but to keep a soft spot in your heart for the protagonists, from movie to movie. To be sure, as the MCU has evolved, growing into an epic that can be, at times, confusing, a through line has coalesced around a group of inanimate objects: six powerful Infinity Stones whose scattered locations have shifted from planet to planet and from person to person, like a cosmic shell game, as the movies came and went.\nBut it was always the lives of the people on screen that mattered most.\nAs even casual fans will remember, those stones ended up in the wrong hands at the end of the last Avengers movie, \u201cInfinity War.\u201d That 2018 film ended with a cliffhanger in which the villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) snapped his fingers, with cataclysmic consequences for many of the heroes we have come to know and, yes, love.\nThe results of Thanos\u2019s simple yet devastating gesture, which some wags have taken to calling the \u201cSnapture,\u201d were memorably shocking. But not as indelible as the shadow that crept across his face just before the closing credits: the enigmatic half-smile \u2014 midway between regret and relief \u2014 of a psychopathic, purple Mona Lisa.\nIt\u2019s helpful, before going to see \u201cEndgame,\u201d to cast your mind back to the contradictory feelings of that final scene. The new movie, which centers on the efforts of Captain America (Chris Evans) and the remaining Avengers to implement a do-over \u2014 essentially rewinding the effects of Thanos\u2019s snap \u2014 feels at once sad and deeply satisfying, complicated and surprisingly comic. If many of us have grown up with the MCU, the films themselves have also grown more complex, like a fine wine.\nToo much? Probably. Would you believe a well-aged cheese?\nThis is, let us not forget, a comic-book movie, with starkly drawn lines of good and evil, and unapologetically reductive storytelling. But amid all the action and the derring-do, between the hooey and the hokum, there\u2019s room for real emotion.\nSo how do Cap and the gang mean to fix things? If you remember last year\u2019s \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp,\u201d that film ended with Paul Rudd\u2019s shrinkable Ant-Man trapped in the Quantum Realm, a subatomic state where the laws of space and time don\u2019t apply. Well, Ant-Man is back \u2014 it\u2019s no spoiler; he\u2019s in the trailer \u2014 and he\u2019s brought with him an idea for what he calls a \u201ctime heist,\u201d combining two of filmdom\u2019s most wildly entertaining genres: time travel and the crime caper. The details of the plan should best not be spelled out, but they entail our heroes revisiting destinations that will be familiar from earlier films \u2014 New York City, the Norse celestial plain of Asgard and the planets Morag and Vormir \u2014 as well as the action of those films themselves, including \u201cThor: The Dark World\u201d and \u201cThe Avengers.\u201d\nIn a sense, \u201cEndgame\u201d is an example of the MCU cannibalizing itself, but it has always done so. And it does so here in a fresh way that is closer to homage than lazy appropriation. These affectionate flashbacks also serve as a tip of the hat to all the loyal fans who have held this sprawling mythology so dear.\nAs high as the stakes are in \u201cEndgame,\u201d it is also a very funny movie. The humor of the story \u2014 some of which takes place in the future, five years after the end of \u201cInfinity War\u201d \u2014 has to do with surprising ways in which the lives of certain characters have changed (along with their personalities and, in some cases, their physiques).\nAs far as holding a thought is concerned, the characters at the center of \u201cEndgame\u201d \u2014 most prominently Captain America and Iron Man \u2014 have always been stubbornly monomaniacal, to a fault. On the K\u00fcbler-Ross cycle of grief, as \u201cEndgame\u201d gets underway, they\u2019re still stuck in Stage 1: denial. Thanos puts it this way: \u201cYou could not live with your own failure.\u201d\nIf \u201cInfinity War\u201d was about failure, \u201cEndgame\u201d is, ironically, all about acceptance and moving on. After 11 long years, the Infinity Saga is finally, fulfillingly over. There is no post-credit scene. But oh, what a going-away party these old friends have thrown for themselves.",

An estimated 400,000 women in the United States each year suffer from postpartum depression.</p>\n<p>The newly approved drug, called brexanolone, will be marketed under the name Zulresso. It will cost, on an average, $34,000 per patient for a course of treatment, before discounts, according to the manufacturer, Sage Therapeutics in Cambridge, Mass.</p>\n<p>Tiffany Farchione, acting director of the psychiatry products division at FDA, said in a statement that the medication represented &ldquo;an important new treatment option&rdquo; for a potentially life-threatening condition. The drug, she said, is administered intravenously for 60 continuous hours. The approval requires that it be administered under strict safety conditions because of concerns it can cause &ldquo;excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The drug will be available to patients only through a restricted distribution program at certified facilities &mdash; such as doctors&rsquo; offices or clinics &mdash; where health-care providers can carefully monitor the patient. It will carry a &ldquo;boxed warning,&rdquo; which is the strongest warning required by the FDA.</p>\n<p>The FDA-approved label says data from a study in which a dozen women who were breast-feeding received the drug showed that the medication is transferred to breast milk in nursing mothers. However, the amount that is passed to the infant is low, and available data &ldquo;do not suggest a significant risk of adverse reactions to breastfed infants from exposure to Zulresso.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The FDA said the drug&rsquo;s efficacy was shown in two clinical studies in which participants received either the medication or a placebo and were then followed for four weeks.</p>\n<p>Experts called the drug a major advance for a serious illness that does not get enough attention. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any treatments that are anywhere near this effective,&rdquo; said Jess Fiedorowicz, a psychiatrist at the University of Iowa and a member of an FDA advisory panel that recommended agency approval of the drug. &ldquo;So this is groundbreaking in that regard.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Women diagnosed with postpartum depression are currently treated with antidepressants and psychotherapy, but the drugs take four to eight weeks to be fully effective and generally have only a small to moderate impact. The new drug, by contrast, takes effect quickly and lasts at least 30 days, according to clinical studies.</p>\n<p>Samantha Meltzer-Brody, a psychiatrist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who led the clinical trials for the drug, said the medication is such an improvement over current therapies that she doubts the IV administration will discourage its use. She noted that postpartum depression, one of the most common complications of childbirth, is &ldquo;underdiagnosed and neglected,&rdquo; and that suicide is a major cause of maternal death.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For women suffering, you can say, &lsquo;You can come in and be treated and in 2.5 days it can go away, and not come back,&rsquo; &quot; she said. In clinical trials, she added, the IV administration did not prevent women from getting the drug.</p>\n<p>The main component of drug is allopregnanolone, &ldquo;a breakdown product&rdquo; of the hormone progesterone that affects the GABA neurotransmitters, which have a role in mood regulation, Meltzer-Brody said. She added that the exact mechanism of action is unknown.</p>\n<p>Sage is developing another drug to treat postpartum depression and major depressive disorder that would be administered as a once-daily pill. The medication recently showed good results in a Phase 3 clinical trial. If approved, it could be a blockbuster, some industry analysts say.</p>\n<p>The FDA&rsquo;s advisory committee recommended approval of brexanolone in early November, but the agency delayed the green light to evaluate concerns about the small number of women who lost consciousness while receiving the drug. The agency&rsquo;s safety requirements are designed to deal with those safety concerns.</p>\n<p>Anna Glezer, a psychiatrist at the University of California at San Francisco, said she was encouraged to see an entirely new approach to medication for depression and, in particular, a product aimed specifically at women&rsquo;s mental health.</p>\n<p>She said mild to moderate cases can be missed because the fatigue and sleeplessness that accompany the arrival of a new baby are also some of the physical symptoms of depression. In her clinical practice, she said, she asks women: &ldquo;Can you sleep when your baby is sleeping? Is your energy lower given how much sleep you&rsquo;re getting?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Given the way the drug will be administered, Glezer said she expects it to be used mainly on the most severe cases, especially women whose postpartum depression requires hospitalization.</p>\n<p>The FDA action is the second important approval involving depression this year. Earlier this month, in biggest advance for depression in years, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/03/06/biggest-advance-depression-years-fda-approves-novel-treatment-hardest-cases/?utm_term=.c7792c04316f&tid=lk_inline_manual_32\">FDA approved esketamine,</a> also called Spravato, for people with major depression who have not responded to other treatments.</p>",

                "text": "The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved the first drug specifically for postpartum depression \u2014 a debilitating condition that affects hundreds of thousands of women a year in the United States.\nThe disorder, which begins during pregnancy or within a month of childbirth, is characterized by feelings of worthlessness or guilt, or thoughts of suicide and is far more severe than the common \u201cbaby blues.\u201d The condition can interfere with a mother\u2019s ability to bond with an infant, which can affect the baby\u2019s development. An estimated 400,000 women in the United States each year suffer from postpartum depression.\nThe newly approved drug, called brexanolone, will be marketed under the name Zulresso. It will cost, on an average, $34,000 per patient for a course of treatment, before discounts, according to the manufacturer, Sage Therapeutics in Cambridge, Mass.\nTiffany Farchione, acting director of the psychiatry products division at FDA, said in a statement that the medication represented \u201can important new treatment option\u201d for a potentially life-threatening condition. The drug, she said, is administered intravenously for 60 continuous hours. The approval requires that it be administered under strict safety conditions because of concerns it can cause \u201cexcessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness.\u201d\nThe drug will be available to patients only through a restricted distribution program at certified facilities \u2014 such as doctors\u2019 offices or clinics \u2014 where health-care providers can carefully monitor the patient. It will carry a \u201cboxed warning,\u201d which is the strongest warning required by the FDA.\nThe FDA-approved label says data from a study in which a dozen women who were breast-feeding received the drug showed that the medication is transferred to breast milk in nursing mothers. However, the amount that is passed to the infant is low, and available data \u201cdo not suggest a significant risk of adverse reactions to breastfed infants from exposure to Zulresso.\u201d\nThe FDA said the drug\u2019s efficacy was shown in two clinical studies in which participants received either the medication or a placebo and were then followed for four weeks.\nExperts called the drug a major advance for a serious illness that does not get enough attention. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any treatments that are anywhere near this effective,\u201d said Jess Fiedorowicz, a psychiatrist at the University of Iowa and a member of an FDA advisory panel that recommended agency approval of the drug. \u201cSo this is groundbreaking in that regard.\u201d\nWomen diagnosed with postpartum depression are currently treated with antidepressants and psychotherapy, but the drugs take four to eight weeks to be fully effective and generally have only a small to moderate impact. The new drug, by contrast, takes effect quickly and lasts at least 30 days, according to clinical studies.\nSamantha Meltzer-Brody, a psychiatrist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who led the clinical trials for the drug, said the medication is such an improvement over current therapies that she doubts the IV administration will discourage its use. She noted that postpartum depression, one of the most common complications of childbirth, is \u201cunderdiagnosed and neglected,\u201d and that suicide is a major cause of maternal death.\n\u201cFor women suffering, you can say, \u2018You can come in and be treated and in 2.5 days it can go away, and not come back,\u2019 \" she said. In clinical trials, she added, the IV administration did not prevent women from getting the drug.\nThe main component of drug is allopregnanolone, \u201ca breakdown product\u201d of the hormone progesterone that affects the GABA neurotransmitters, which have a role in mood regulation, Meltzer-Brody said. She added that the exact mechanism of action is unknown.\nSage is developing another drug to treat postpartum depression and major depressive disorder that would be administered as a once-daily pill. The medication recently showed good results in a Phase 3 clinical trial. If approved, it could be a blockbuster, some industry analysts say.\nThe FDA\u2019s advisory committee recommended approval of brexanolone in early November, but the agency delayed the green light to evaluate concerns about the small number of women who lost consciousness while receiving the drug. The agency\u2019s safety requirements are designed to deal with those safety concerns.\nAnna Glezer, a psychiatrist at the University of California at San Francisco, said she was encouraged to see an entirely new approach to medication for depression and, in particular, a product aimed specifically at women\u2019s mental health.\nShe said mild to moderate cases can be missed because the fatigue and sleeplessness that accompany the arrival of a new baby are also some of the physical symptoms of depression. In her clinical practice, she said, she asks women: \u201cCan you sleep when your baby is sleeping? Is your energy lower given how much sleep you\u2019re getting?\u201d\nGiven the way the drug will be administered, Glezer said she expects it to be used mainly on the most severe cases, especially women whose postpartum depression requires hospitalization.\nThe FDA action is the second important approval involving depression this year. Earlier this month, in biggest advance for depression in years, the FDA approved esketamine, also called Spravato, for people with major depression who have not responded to other treatments.",

(Pete Marovich/Bloomberg)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Medicare officials on Tuesday proposed increasing reimbursements for a groundbreaking but costly cancer therapy used for patients whose blood cancers don&rsquo;t respond to other treatments.</p>\n<p>Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the proposed changes are necessary because &ldquo;Medicare&rsquo;s antiquated payment systems&rdquo; have not kept up with the development of &ldquo;transformative technologies.&rdquo; She said she is concerned inadequate payments might be prompting hospitals to limit Medicare patients&rsquo; access to needed therapies.</p>\n<p>In particular, she said the agency was considering boosting reimbursements for a customized approach called CAR T-cell therapy, which has revolutionized the treatment of hard-to-treat pediatric leukemia and adult lymphoma. Hospitals have complained vociferously that they lose tens of thousands of dollars &mdash; and in some cases, hundreds of thousands &mdash; on each Medicare patient they treat.</p>\n<p>The list prices for the drugs are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/staggering-prices-slow-insurers-coverage-of-car-t-cancer-therapy/2018/07/23/96eaa16c-8ea7-11e8-ae59-01880eac5f1d_story.html?utm_term=.6a4841da65e2&tid=lk_inline_manual_7\">$373,000 or $475,000</a>, depending on the illness for which they are used. Accompanying hospital care can double or triple the expense, especially for a patient with severe side effects who ends up in the intensive care unit, health providers say. Yet Medicare reimburses only a portion of that overall cost.</p>\n<p>In a press call with reporters, Verma said the agency is considering increasing a special payment to hospitals for expensive new technologies from the current maximum of 50 percent to 65 percent of the product&rsquo;s cost. That would boost payments for CAR T-cell therapy from $186,500 to $242,450. The agency also is considering changes to the formula used to calculate payments to hospitals for the treatment.</p>\n<p>The ideas are part of the agency&rsquo;s proposed rule for reimbursement rates for fiscal year 2020 for hospital inpatient services and long-term care hospitals. The agency also is proposing to increase the wage index of low wage index hospitals to try to bring stability to rural hospitals, Verma said. If the changes are adopted, they would go into effect Oct. 1.</p>\n<p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved two versions of CAR T-cell therapy &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/08/30/fda-approves-first-of-its-kind-living-drug-for-childhood-leukemia/?utm_term=.985c035b7564&tid=lk_inline_manual_12\">Kymriah, made by Novartis</a>, for childhood leukemia and lymphoma, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/10/19/cutting-edge-immunotherapy-treatment-approved-for-yet-another-deadly-cancer/?utm_term=.1afd6d3711d1&tid=lk_inline_manual_12\">Yescarta, manufactured by Gilead Sciences, for lymphoma.</a> The treatments are approved for patients who have not responded to other therapies and have no other options.</p>\n<p>The benefits of the treatment, when it works, can last for months, years or even a lifetime, experts say. Still, a substantial proportion of patients who are treated and initially go into remission do relapse.</p>\n<p>The complicated treatment uses the patient&rsquo;s own immune system to fight cancer. Their T cells, which are immune cells, are extracted, sent to a special lab and genetically modified to attack a protein on the surface of the cancer cells. After being multiplied in number, the T cells are infused back into the patient, where they expand further in number, creating an army of anti-cancer agents.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s little question that when done effectively in the right circumstances for the right patients, it can be a lifesaving treatment,&rdquo; said J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.</p>\n<p>Roy Silverstein, president of the American Society of Hematology, said on Tuesday he was pleased CMS responded to the group&rsquo;s concerns about inadequate inpatient reimbursement for CAR T-cell therapy. Increasing the payment for medical technologies to 65 percent of the cost would be &ldquo;a significant improvement,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are concerned that Medicare beneficiaries will continue to face barriers accessing CAR T-cell therapy unless providers are reimbursed equitably for the treatment,&rdquo; said the letter, whose signers included the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the Cancer Support Community, a patient-support group.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, CMS separately proposed a national policy to cover the therapy for Medicare patients, but with certain restrictions. A final decision on that proposal is not expected until May. Currently, coverage decisions for CAR T-cell therapy are left up to local Medicare administrators.</p>",

                "text": "Medicare officials on Tuesday proposed increasing reimbursements for a groundbreaking but costly cancer therapy used for patients whose blood cancers don\u2019t respond to other treatments.\nSeema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the proposed changes are necessary because \u201cMedicare\u2019s antiquated payment systems\u201d have not kept up with the development of \u201ctransformative technologies.\u201d She said she is concerned inadequate payments might be prompting hospitals to limit Medicare patients\u2019 access to needed therapies.\nIn particular, she said the agency was considering boosting reimbursements for a customized approach called CAR T-cell therapy, which has revolutionized the treatment of hard-to-treat pediatric leukemia and adult lymphoma. Hospitals have complained vociferously that they lose tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 and in some cases, hundreds of thousands \u2014 on each Medicare patient they treat.\nThe list prices for the drugs are $373,000 or $475,000, depending on the illness for which they are used. Accompanying hospital care can double or triple the expense, especially for a patient with severe side effects who ends up in the intensive care unit, health providers say. Yet Medicare reimburses only a portion of that overall cost.\nIn a press call with reporters, Verma said the agency is considering increasing a special payment to hospitals for expensive new technologies from the current maximum of 50 percent to 65 percent of the product\u2019s cost. That would boost payments for CAR T-cell therapy from $186,500 to $242,450. The agency also is considering changes to the formula used to calculate payments to hospitals for the treatment.\nThe ideas are part of the agency\u2019s proposed rule for reimbursement rates for fiscal year 2020 for hospital inpatient services and long-term care hospitals. The agency also is proposing to increase the wage index of low wage index hospitals to try to bring stability to rural hospitals, Verma said. If the changes are adopted, they would go into effect Oct. 1.\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved two versions of CAR T-cell therapy \u2014 Kymriah, made by Novartis, for childhood leukemia and lymphoma, and Yescarta, manufactured by Gilead Sciences, for lymphoma. The treatments are approved for patients who have not responded to other therapies and have no other options.\nThe benefits of the treatment, when it works, can last for months, years or even a lifetime, experts say. Still, a substantial proportion of patients who are treated and initially go into remission do relapse.\nThe complicated treatment uses the patient\u2019s own immune system to fight cancer. Their T cells, which are immune cells, are extracted, sent to a special lab and genetically modified to attack a protein on the surface of the cancer cells. After being multiplied in number, the T cells are infused back into the patient, where they expand further in number, creating an army of anti-cancer agents.\n\u201cThere\u2019s little question that when done effectively in the right circumstances for the right patients, it can be a lifesaving treatment,\u201d said J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.\nRoy Silverstein, president of the American Society of Hematology, said on Tuesday he was pleased CMS responded to the group\u2019s concerns about inadequate inpatient reimbursement for CAR T-cell therapy. Increasing the payment for medical technologies to 65 percent of the cost would be \u201ca significant improvement,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe are concerned that Medicare beneficiaries will continue to face barriers accessing CAR T-cell therapy unless providers are reimbursed equitably for the treatment,\u201d said the letter, whose signers included the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the Cancer Support Community, a patient-support group.\nEarlier this year, CMS separately proposed a national policy to cover the therapy for Medicare patients, but with certain restrictions. A final decision on that proposal is not expected until May. Currently, coverage decisions for CAR T-cell therapy are left up to local Medicare administrators.",

His campaign raised more than $6 million its first day, edging out Sen. Bernie Sanders&rsquo;s (Vt.) impressive one-day fundraising a few weeks earlier.</p>\n<p>A few days later, the website <a href=\"https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3633/Who-will-win-the-2020-Democratic-presidential-nomination\">PredictIt</a> (&ldquo;the stock market for politics&rdquo;) listed as its top three presidential contenders: former vice president Joe Biden (who hasn&rsquo;t even declared yet), Sanders and O&rsquo;Rourke.</p>\n<p>Somehow, despite a remarkably diverse Democratic field &mdash; which includes a record number of women, a gay man and several people of color &mdash; the B-Boys (that is, Beto, Biden and Bernie) &mdash; were off and running.</p>\n<p>The news media undoubtedly was part of the equation. With more than 18 months to go before the 2020 election, the love and attention was not being dished out in equal measure.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Good-Mad-Revolutionary-Power-Womens/dp/1501181793\">author Rebecca Traister</a> described it, she woke up one morning this week thinking about the flawed notion that being a white man is actually a <i>disadvantage,</i> given this diverse field.</p>\n<p>The reality is quite the opposite, she wrote on Twitter: &ldquo;Early metrics would show it to be an extremely powerful polling &amp; fundraising boon, as it has always, always been.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Author Linda Hirshman told me how frustrated she felt this week after watching &ldquo;brilliant&rdquo; town-hall appearances featuring Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.). The candidates offered detailed policy proposals and came off as smart and appealing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But I woke up to still more media fixation on Beto,&rdquo; she said. (Warren did capture some prominent <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/19/elizabeth-warren-wants-kill-electoral-college/?utm_term=.e83a9b0f9d7e&tid=lk_inline_manual_16\">headlines</a> for saying she&rsquo;d like to see the end of the electoral college in favor of a system where &ldquo;every vote matters.&rdquo;)</p>\n<p>The reason for this, Hirshman posits, is the almost cartoonish way in which the national media depicts candidates: as characters in a drama.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The national media is most interested in telling stories, in an almost novelistic way,&rdquo; said Hirshman, whose book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reckoning-Battle-Against-Sexual-Harassment/dp/1328566447\">&ldquo;Reckoning: The Epic Battle Against Sexual Abuse and Harassment&rdquo;</a> will be published in June.</p>\n<p>Traditional fiction, after all, likes to depict a woman in peril and the caped male avenger swooping in to save the day. While local news media tend to focus on policy that would affect their communities, national media look for &mdash; and endlessly repeat &mdash; the broad-brush caricature: Gillibrand is the mean woman who unfairly took down Al Franken; O&rsquo;Rourke is &ldquo;tall and cute&rdquo; and wants to heal a divided country.</p>\n<p>Robert Leonard, news director of two Iowa radio stations, told me in an email exchange that he&rsquo;s been impressed by the enthusiastic welcome that candidates including Gillibrand, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) are getting in his state.</p>\n<p>He described the Massachusetts senator as &ldquo;electric,&rdquo; attracting a huge crowd and exuding personal warmth. (A far cry from the fretting about whether she is likable enough.) &ldquo;People love Cory Booker, too.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Having talked to Iowa supporters of every candidate in the race (and some who aren&rsquo;t yet), Leonard sees the contest as wide open and offers this caution: &ldquo;Poll numbers that show Biden and Sanders up top only tell us about the past, not the future.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But, one might argue, doesn&rsquo;t it make good sense to give the most coverage to those candidates who seem to have the most early support?</p>\n<p>Is it the &ldquo;horse-race&rdquo; model that attempts to say who&rsquo;s ahead and who will ultimately win the nomination and the presidency? You might recall from 2016 that &mdash; despite all the honing of this skill &mdash; prognostication is not the media&rsquo;s forte.</p>\n<p>Or is it a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/campaign-journalism-needs-an-overhaul-heres-one-radical-idea/2019/01/07/76f7bf18-1276-11e9-90a8-136fa44b80ba_story.html?utm_term=.c1bbd499ed5a&tid=lk_inline_manual_34\">citizens-first</a> model that attempts to inform the electorate so they can make the best decisions?</p>\n<p>The horse-race model seems, as usual, to be out ahead by more than a few furlongs.</p>\n<p>And so, we hear a lot about the B-Boys. In polling, in fundraising, in media ardor, they begin to seem inevitable.</p>\n<p>And, when many Democratic voters put sheer electability (unseating President Trump) as the top priority, this media-driven momentum takes on even more power.</p>\n<p>It would be a shame &mdash; and counterproductive &mdash; if premature judgments end up transforming all this diversity and talent into a shrugged-off bunch of also-rans.</p>",

Bernie Sanders\u2019s (Vt.) impressive one-day fundraising a few weeks earlier.\nA few days later, the website PredictIt (\u201cthe stock market for politics\u201d) listed as its top three presidential contenders: former vice president Joe Biden (who hasn\u2019t even declared yet), Sanders and O\u2019Rourke.\nSomehow, despite a remarkably diverse Democratic field \u2014 which includes a record number of women, a gay man and several people of color \u2014 the B-Boys (that is, Beto, Biden and Bernie) \u2014 were off and running.\nThe news media undoubtedly was part of the equation. With more than 18 months to go before the 2020 election, the love and attention was not being dished out in equal measure.\nAs author Rebecca Traister described it, she woke up one morning this week thinking about the flawed notion that being a white man is actually a disadvantage, given this diverse field.\nThe reality is quite the opposite, she wrote on Twitter: \u201cEarly metrics would show it to be an extremely powerful polling & fundraising boon, as it has always, always been.\u201d\nAuthor Linda Hirshman told me how frustrated she felt this week after watching \u201cbrilliant\u201d town-hall appearances featuring Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.). The candidates offered detailed policy proposals and came off as smart and appealing.\n\u201cBut I woke up to still more media fixation on Beto,\u201d she said. (Warren did capture some prominent headlines for saying she\u2019d like to see the end of the electoral college in favor of a system where \u201cevery vote matters.\u201d)\nThe reason for this, Hirshman posits, is the almost cartoonish way in which the national media depicts candidates: as characters in a drama.\n\u201cThe national media is most interested in telling stories, in an almost novelistic way,\u201d said Hirshman, whose book \u201cReckoning: The Epic Battle Against Sexual Abuse and Harassment\u201d will be published in June.\nTraditional fiction, after all, likes to depict a woman in peril and the caped male avenger swooping in to save the day. While local news media tend to focus on policy that would affect their communities, national media look for \u2014 and endlessly repeat \u2014 the broad-brush caricature: Gillibrand is the mean woman who unfairly took down Al Franken; O\u2019Rourke is \u201ctall and cute\u201d and wants to heal a divided country.\nRobert Leonard, news director of two Iowa radio stations, told me in an email exchange that he\u2019s been impressed by the enthusiastic welcome that candidates including Gillibrand, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) are getting in his state.\nHe described the Massachusetts senator as \u201celectric,\u201d attracting a huge crowd and exuding personal warmth. (A far cry from the fretting about whether she is likable enough.) \u201cPeople love Cory Booker, too.\u201d\nHaving talked to Iowa supporters of every candidate in the race (and some who aren\u2019t yet), Leonard sees the contest as wide open and offers this caution: \u201cPoll numbers that show Biden and Sanders up top only tell us about the past, not the future.\u201d\nBut, one might argue, doesn\u2019t it make good sense to give the most coverage to those candidates who seem to have the most early support?\nIs it the \u201chorse-race\u201d model that attempts to say who\u2019s ahead and who will ultimately win the nomination and the presidency? You might recall from 2016 that \u2014 despite all the honing of this skill \u2014 prognostication is not the media\u2019s forte.\nOr is it a citizens-first model that attempts to inform the electorate so they can make the best decisions?\nThe horse-race model seems, as usual, to be out ahead by more than a few furlongs.\nAnd so, we hear a lot about the B-Boys. In polling, in fundraising, in media ardor, they begin to seem inevitable.\nAnd, when many Democratic voters put sheer electability (unseating President Trump) as the top priority, this media-driven momentum takes on even more power.\nIt would be a shame \u2014 and counterproductive \u2014 if premature judgments end up transforming all this diversity and talent into a shrugged-off bunch of also-rans.",

                "text": "Reporters have long approached White House press secretary Sarah Sanders with a trust-but-verify attitude, knowing full well that Sanders is tasked with spinning some of the more unspinnable statements made by her boss, President Trump.\nBut with the publication of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report on Thursday, Sanders\u2019s credibility among the people who cover her has been stretched about as taut as a violin string.\nOne White House reporter, April Ryan, has openly called for Sanders to be fired. While others don\u2019t go that far, they acknowledge that Sanders\u2019s public statements have damaged her, perhaps permanently, as the president\u2019s spokeswoman. In conversations with reporters, it\u2019s not unusual to hear her compared unfavorably to Ron Ziegler, President Nixon\u2019s press secretary, whose reputation was shredded by the Watergate scandal.\nSanders admitted under oath to Mueller\u2019s investigators that she made false statements to the press after Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey in May 2017. Sanders told Mueller that her comment that \u201ccountless\u201d FBI employees had told her they supported the president\u2019s decision was \u201ca slip of the tongue.\u201d She also said a second utterance \u2014 in which she said that Trump and \u201cthe rest of the FBI\u201d had lost confidence in Comey \u2014 was made \u201cin the heat of the moment.\u201d Mueller\u2019s report concluded that her comments were \u201cnot founded on anything.\u201d\nGiven that she made the erroneous statements on two separate occasions, her explanations for them raised the possibility that she not only lied, but lied in explaining why she lied.\n\u201cI hope and trust that she understands why this is a big deal and why it matters to us and to her,\u201d said Peter Baker, the veteran New York Times White House reporter, in an interview Monday. \u201cA press secretary\u2019s most important asset is credibility. If you don\u2019t have that, there\u2019s not much point. But we all make mistakes.

In any other job, if someone acknowledged they lied under oath, they\u2019d be gone. They\u2019d be terminated.\u201d\nAfter Ryan called for Trump to \u201cstart lopping the heads off\u201d of discredited officials, including Sanders, Sanders\u2019s father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, called the comment \u201can incitement to murder\u201d on Twitter.

Prosecutors say checks from 33 parents funded fakery on SAT and ACT admissions tests and sophisticated ruses to designate applicants with minimal or no intercollegiate sports potential as recruited athletes. That label would boost their chances of admission.</p>\n<p>The most frequent target in the alleged admissions fraud scam: USC, the current or former employer of six of the 50 alleged perpetrators, including a renowned water polo coach, a senior athletics official and even a professor seeking to help his college-bound daughter.</p>\n<p>The admissions investigation hit USC at a moment of vulnerability. Last summer, its president, C.L. &ldquo;Max&rdquo; Nikias, was forced out amid an uproar over the handling of controversies, including allegations of abuse by a USC gynecologist and the resignations of two medical school deans amid questions about alleged misconduct. School trustees are nearing the end of a search to replace Nikias.</p>\n<p>The chair of USC&rsquo;s board, Rick Caruso, said in an interview Tuesday that the school will do whatever it takes to find out what happened in the scandal and prevent a repeat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unthinkable what these parents did,&rdquo; Caruso said, and unthinkable what the administrator and coaches were alleged to have done.</p>\n<p>Frederick J. Ryan Jr., publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, is also a member of the board. He declined to comment.</p>\n<p>USC interim president Wanda M. Austin pledged aggressive action to uphold the integrity of admissions after prosecutors announced charges March 12 in Boston. USC has denied admission to the upcoming freshman class for applicants with ties to the alleged scam, launched a review of current students and graduates who may be linked, fired two employees and placed another on leave as a step toward termination. Austin said USC also would consider revoking degrees of those who fraudulently secured admission.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Rebuilding trust is something you do over a period of time,&rdquo; Austin told The Post in a telephone interview. &ldquo;Some of the sanctions we&rsquo;ve already taken should signal that we&rsquo;re taking this very seriously.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Over the past several years, federal investigators alleged, the scam facilitated admission to USC for more than two dozen students as recruited athletes, even though many had fabricated credentials in water polo, soccer and track and field.</p>\n<p>Austin acknowledged the breadth of USC&rsquo;s exposure to the scandal poses many questions. Chief among them: Why weren&rsquo;t alarms raised internally years ago about the phenomenon of purported student-athletes who failed to join or play for the teams that recruited them?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;One of the things we want to understand is how the process was falsified and what steps individuals were taking to cover up their actions,&rdquo; Austin said. Given what is now known, she said, it is a challenge &ldquo;to look back at the facts and say, &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you recognize something as a yellow flashing light?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>\n<p>Many on the faculty are upset. &ldquo;We have made far too many errors in judgment over the last two years &mdash; and this is par for the course,&rdquo; said William G. Tierney, a professor and scholar of higher education.</p>\n<p>USC is not the only school facing questions. Others with current and former athletic coaches charged in the scam include Georgetown, Yale, Stanford and Wake Forest universities, as well as the University of Texas at Austin and the University of California at Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the University of California at Berkeley confirmed that it has opened an investigation into a former student whose father, Canadian businessman David Sidoo, is accused of participating in the scam. Prosecutors say Sidoo paid $100,000 for his son to obtain fake SAT scores that he submitted in 2014 for admission to Berkeley. Sidoo has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.</p>\n<p>A lawyer familiar with the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss potential strategies, said that parents could argue they were duped by an unscrupulous admissions consultant: William &ldquo;Rick&rdquo; Singer, the alleged mastermind of the scam. Singer, of Newport Beach, Calif., has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges and is cooperating with investigators.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Rick Singer&rsquo;s a sales guy and a con guy,&rdquo; the lawyer said, suggesting that parents were unaware their money would be put to illegal use. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t know what the scheme was. They knew that they were giving money to help their kid get into the school.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Over and over, the investigation found, the school that many of the accused parents sought for their children was USC. Court documents allege that one father conspired with Singer to create a fake profile of his son as a football player.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna make him a kicker/punter and they&rsquo;re gonna walk him through with football, and I&rsquo;ll get a picture and figure out how to Photoshop and stuff,&rdquo; Singer told the father, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Several alleged transactions involved Donna Heinel, who was senior associate athletic director at USC. She has been charged with racketeering conspiracy and is scheduled to appear in federal court in Boston next week. USC fired her last week. Telephone and email messages to Heinel were not returned.</p>\n<p>From 2014 to 2018, prosecutors say, Singer&rsquo;s clients paid more than $1.3 million to USC accounts controlled by Heinel. In addition, Heinel allegedly received sham consulting payments from Singer of $20,000 a month starting in July 2018. In exchange for the bribes, prosecutors say, Heinel agreed to help purported athletes get in.</p>\n<p>In 2016, for instance, prosecutors quote Singer as saying that Heinel wanted to help an applicant pose as a coxswain for the crew team. That applicant was granted conditional admission in October 2016, and the father allegedly sent Heinel a check that month for $50,000, payable to USC athletics.</p>\n<p>The case is a setback in USC&rsquo;s years-long effort to shake the stereotype that it is a playground for the rich.</p>\n<p>Just west of the Harbor Freeway, the campus is dotted with palm trees and tranquil vistas of promenades and quads. On Monday, students returned from spring break with the sun shining and temperatures in the high 70s. The formidable women&rsquo;s beach volleyball team held practice on a sand court, and several students in suits zipped around on motorized skateboards.</p>\n<p>There is, to be sure, plenty of privilege. Campus restaurants serve acai bowls, poke and salmon salads. A nearby shopping center includes a store that peddles fancy gummy bears and skin-care products. The bookstore has a &ldquo;cupcake ATM&rdquo; that dispenses gourmet cupcakes instead of cash. Federal data shows that about 40 percent of the university&rsquo;s 19,000 undergraduates pay full price. That exceeds $70,000 a year for tuition, fees, room and board.</p>\n<p>But 21 percent have enough financial need to qualify for federal Pell Grants &mdash; a higher share than what is found at many prominent private research universities. USC also has built an unusually <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/05/12/at-the-university-of-southern-california-a-rare-open-door-for-transfer-students/?tid=lk_inline_manual_49\">wide pipeline of transfer students </a>from community colleges.</p>\n<p>One is Miriam Antonio, 22, a junior who grew up in this city&rsquo;s Koreatown. Her mother is a night-shift janitor, and Antonio is first in her family to go to college.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is true that wealth can buy your way into a lot of places and that there is an unequal playing field,&rdquo; Antonio said. &ldquo;Also, it made me more upset to know that students whose parents participated in this took a spot from a student that actually deserved it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>USC has climbed steadily in prestige over the past two decades. In 1996, it ranked 44th on the U.S. News &amp; World Report list of top national universities. By 2011, it had cracked the top 25. This year it ranks 22nd, tied with Georgetown and UC-Berkeley, and just ahead of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Virginia.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was a school for rich kids and over the past few years it turned into a powerhouse,&rdquo; said Jacob Soll, a USC professor of philosophy, history and accounting. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to imagine the positive impact this has had on L.A., California and the country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Federal data shows that applications to USC for freshman admission have doubled since 2001, to more than 56,000 in 2017. During that time, it became much harder to win a coveted seat at the school: Just 16 percent of applicants were accepted in 2017, compared with 34 percent in 2001.</p>\n<p>With competition intensifying, admission consultants say pressure has risen in certain social circles to find paths into what is seen as a top-notch university with a full menu of fraternities and sororities and high-level NCAA athletics.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You have to able to go to the cocktail party with the right Birkin bag and to be able to say . . . &lsquo;My kid goes to USC,&rsquo; &rdquo; said Arun Ponnusamy, chief academic officer for the counseling company Collegewise. That kind of thinking is a backdrop to the scandal.</p>\n<p>Rogers, the sophomore from Georgia, who is treasurer of the First-Generation College Student Union, called the scandal disappointing but saw a potential upside.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Even though it&rsquo;s bad press, I feel like there&rsquo;s a benefit to it, too,&rdquo; Rogers said. &ldquo;I feel like more people are going to apply knowing that someone paid $500,000 to get their son or daughter into the school.&rdquo;</p>",

Prosecutors say Sidoo paid $100,000 for his son to obtain fake SAT scores that he submitted in 2014 for admission to Berkeley. Sidoo has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.\nA lawyer familiar with the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss potential strategies, said that parents could argue they were duped by an unscrupulous admissions consultant: William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, the alleged mastermind of the scam. Singer, of Newport Beach, Calif., has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges and is cooperating with investigators.\n\u201cRick Singer\u2019s a sales guy and a con guy,\u201d the lawyer said, suggesting that parents were unaware their money would be put to illegal use. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know what the scheme was. They knew that they were giving money to help their kid get into the school.\u201d\nOver and over, the investigation found, the school that many of the accused parents sought for their children was USC. Court documents allege that one father conspired with Singer to create a fake profile of his son as a football player.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna make him a kicker/punter and they\u2019re gonna walk him through with football, and I\u2019ll get a picture and figure out how to Photoshop and stuff,\u201d Singer told the father, according to court documents.\nSeveral alleged transactions involved Donna Heinel, who was senior associate athletic director at USC. She has been charged with racketeering conspiracy and is scheduled to appear in federal court in Boston next week. USC fired her last week. Telephone and email messages to Heinel were not returned.\nFrom 2014 to 2018, prosecutors say, Singer\u2019s clients paid more than $1.3 million to USC accounts controlled by Heinel. In addition, Heinel allegedly received sham consulting payments from Singer of $20,000 a month starting in July 2018. In exchange for the bribes, prosecutors say, Heinel agreed to help purported athletes get in.\nIn 2016, for instance, prosecutors quote Singer as saying that Heinel wanted to help an applicant pose as a coxswain for the crew team. That applicant was granted conditional admission in October 2016, and the father allegedly sent Heinel a check that month for $50,000, payable to USC athletics.\nThe case is a setback in USC\u2019s years-long effort to shake the stereotype that it is a playground for the rich.\nJust west of the Harbor Freeway, the campus is dotted with palm trees and tranquil vistas of promenades and quads. On Monday, students returned from spring break with the sun shining and temperatures in the high 70s. The formidable women\u2019s beach volleyball team held practice on a sand court, and several students in suits zipped around on motorized skateboards.\nThere is, to be sure, plenty of privilege. Campus restaurants serve acai bowls, poke and salmon salads. A nearby shopping center includes a store that peddles fancy gummy bears and skin-care products. The bookstore has a \u201ccupcake ATM\u201d that dispenses gourmet cupcakes instead of cash. Federal data shows that about 40 percent of the university\u2019s 19,000 undergraduates pay full price. That exceeds $70,000 a year for tuition, fees, room and board.\nBut 21 percent have enough financial need to qualify for federal Pell Grants \u2014 a higher share than what is found at many prominent private research universities. USC also has built an unusually wide pipeline of transfer students from community colleges.\nOne is Miriam Antonio, 22, a junior who grew up in this city\u2019s Koreatown. Her mother is a night-shift janitor, and Antonio is first in her family to go to college.\n\u201cIt is true that wealth can buy your way into a lot of places and that there is an unequal playing field,\u201d Antonio said. \u201cAlso, it made me more upset to know that students whose parents participated in this took a spot from a student that actually deserved it.\u201d\nUSC has climbed steadily in prestige over the past two decades. In 1996, it ranked 44th on the U.S. News & World Report list of top national universities. By 2011, it had cracked the top 25. This year it ranks 22nd, tied with Georgetown and UC-Berkeley, and just ahead of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Virginia.\n\u201cIt was a school for rich kids and over the past few years it turned into a powerhouse,\u201d said Jacob Soll, a USC professor of philosophy, history and accounting. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine the positive impact this has had on L.A., California and the country.\u201d\nFederal data shows that applications to USC for freshman admission have doubled since 2001, to more than 56,000 in 2017. During that time, it became much harder to win a coveted seat at the school: Just 16 percent of applicants were accepted in 2017, compared with 34 percent in 2001.\nWith competition intensifying, admission consultants say pressure has risen in certain social circles to find paths into what is seen as a top-notch university with a full menu of fraternities and sororities and high-level NCAA athletics.\n\u201cYou have to able to go to the cocktail party with the right Birkin bag and to be able to say . . . \u2018My kid goes to USC,\u2019 \u201d said Arun Ponnusamy, chief academic officer for the counseling company Collegewise. That kind of thinking is a backdrop to the scandal.\nRogers, the sophomore from Georgia, who is treasurer of the First-Generation College Student Union, called the scandal disappointing but saw a potential upside.\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s bad press, I feel like there\u2019s a benefit to it, too,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cI feel like more people are going to apply knowing that someone paid $500,000 to get their son or daughter into the school.\u201d",

                "html": "<p>Andre Williams, an R&amp;B singer and record producer whose talking, proto-rap style and strutting stage persona earned him the sobriquet &ldquo;Mr. Rhythm,&rdquo; died March 17 at a nursing home in Chicago. He was 82.</p>\n<p>The cause was colon cancer, said his manager and music director, Kenn Goodman.</p>\n<p>Mr. Williams began his career in the 1950s, singing with doo-wop groups. But he said he soon realized he didn&rsquo;t have the soaring tenor of a Clyde McPhatter or Jackie Wilson, and developed a talking blues style laced with dark, street-wise humor.</p>\n<p>His biggest hit, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0kr0IFsM6E\">&ldquo;Bacon Fat&rdquo;</a> (1956), recorded for Fortune Records, a shoestring operation in Detroit, detailed a dance performed in Tennessee by &ldquo;cotton pickers with their sacks on their backs.&rdquo; Featuring off-kilter rhymes, Southern colloquialisms and a recited delivery, it rose to No. 9 on the R&amp;B charts and is sometimes described as a precursor to hip-hop.</p>\n<p>Mr. Williams&rsquo;s other Fortune records from the late 1950s, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngcmRM0ZyQM\">&ldquo;Pulling Time&rdquo;</a> (a reference to prison), &ldquo;The Greasy Chicken&rdquo; and &ldquo;Put a Chain On It&rdquo; (recorded with Gino Parks) proved too rough &mdash; sonically or lyrically &mdash; for the national charts. His song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w09ukTUUhBY\">&ldquo;Jailbait&rdquo;</a> warned men against statutory rape (&ldquo;17 and a half is still jailbait&rdquo;) and ended with Mr. Williams&rsquo;s protagonist pleading for leniency before a judge.</p>\n<p>In the early 1960s, Mr. Williams met Motown record label founder Berry Gordy in a Detroit barber shop and went to work for the label as a producer and songwriter. Mr. Williams often butted heads with Gordy, and he said he was fired and rehired at least five times in four years.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You had to maintain the Motown image 24 hours a day or you&rsquo;d lose your job,&rdquo; Mr. Williams recalled in 1996. &ldquo;I got fired for things I did when I wasn&rsquo;t even working.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Don Imus | Don Imus, who spent more than half a century in radio and television skating along the edge of propriety and occasionally falling into the abyss of the unacceptable, died Dec. 27 at a hospital in College Station, Tex. He was 79. In a roller-coaster career in which he grew chummy with prominent politicians, repeatedly got suspended or fired for offensive cracks, abused drugs and touted health foods, Mr. Imus won a loyal following, made millions and transformed himself from a bad-boy DJ into a host whose program became a nearly mandatory stop for presidential candidates. Read the obituary (Richard Drew/AP)</p>\n<p>While at Motown, he co-wrote <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtklONVqPZM\">&ldquo;Thank You (For Loving Me All the Way)&rdquo;</a> (1964), an early single for 13-year old Little Stevie Wonder.</p>\n<p>Returning to Chicago, Mr. Williams became an independent producer.

                "text": "Andre Williams, an R&B singer and record producer whose talking, proto-rap style and strutting stage persona earned him the sobriquet \u201cMr. Rhythm,\u201d died March 17 at a nursing home in Chicago. He was 82.\nThe cause was colon cancer, said his manager and music director, Kenn Goodman.\nMr. Williams began his career in the 1950s, singing with doo-wop groups. But he said he soon realized he didn\u2019t have the soaring tenor of a Clyde McPhatter or Jackie Wilson, and developed a talking blues style laced with dark, street-wise humor.\nHis biggest hit, \u201cBacon Fat\u201d (1956), recorded for Fortune Records, a shoestring operation in Detroit, detailed a dance performed in Tennessee by \u201ccotton pickers with their sacks on their backs.\u201d Featuring off-kilter rhymes, Southern colloquialisms and a recited delivery, it rose to No. 9 on the R&B charts and is sometimes described as a precursor to hip-hop.\nMr. Williams\u2019s other Fortune records from the late 1950s, including \u201cPulling Time\u201d (a reference to prison), \u201cThe Greasy Chicken\u201d and \u201cPut a Chain On It\u201d (recorded with Gino Parks) proved too rough \u2014 sonically or lyrically \u2014 for the national charts. His song \u201cJailbait\u201d warned men against statutory rape (\u201c17 and a half is still jailbait\u201d) and ended with Mr. Williams\u2019s protagonist pleading for leniency before a judge.\nIn the early 1960s, Mr. Williams met Motown record label founder Berry Gordy in a Detroit barber shop and went to work for the label as a producer and songwriter. Mr. Williams often butted heads with Gordy, and he said he was fired and rehired at least five times in four years.\n\u201cYou had to maintain the Motown image 24 hours a day or you\u2019d lose your job,\u201d Mr. Williams recalled in 1996. \u201cI got fired for things I did when I wasn\u2019t even working.\u201d\nDon Imus | Don Imus, who spent more than half a century in radio and television skating along the edge of propriety and occasionally falling into the abyss of the unacceptable, died Dec. 27 at a hospital in College Station, Tex. He was 79. In a roller-coaster career in which he grew chummy with prominent politicians, repeatedly got suspended or fired for offensive cracks, abused drugs and touted health foods, Mr. Imus won a loyal following, made millions and transformed himself from a bad-boy DJ into a host whose program became a nearly mandatory stop for presidential candidates. Read the obituary (Richard Drew/AP)\nWhile at Motown, he co-wrote \u201cThank You (For Loving Me All the Way)\u201d (1964), an early single for 13-year old Little Stevie Wonder.\nReturning to Chicago, Mr. Williams became an independent producer. He co-wrote and produced \u201cShake a Tail Feather\u201d (1963) for the Five Du-Tones, and the song was covered by Ray Charles in the 1980 movie \u201cThe Blues Brothers.\u201d\nMr. Williams also produced records, including the dance single \u201cTwine Time\u201d (1965) by Alvin Cash & the Crawlers and \u201cThe Funky Judge\u201d (1968) by Bull & the Matadors. He ended the 1960s with another hit of his own, \u201cCadillac Jack,\u201d about an aspiring street hustler who always wanted a Cadillac \u2014 and rode to one in his funeral.\nIn later years, Mr. Williams struggled with drug and alcohol addiction. He said Ike Turner introduced him to cocaine during a stay in Los Angeles, and by the late 1980s he was working as a cook in homeless shelters.\n\u201cI was in a state of depression,\u201d he told the Bergen (N.J.) Record in 1996. \u201cI felt that I had contributed a lot to the business and it hadn\u2019t been given back to me.\u201d\nIn time, his Fortune recordings acquired a cult following among musicians. In the 1990s, after some years on the street, Mr. Williams reemerged, often performing and recording with blistering loud punk and garage-rock bands such as the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and the Dirtbombs.\nZephire Andre Williams was born in Bessemer, Ala., on Nov. 1, 1936. The family moved to Chicago when he was 5, and his father worked at steel mills. By his own account, Mr. Williams was a miscreant while in high school.\n\u201cThe teachers and truant officers said I was headed for reform school if I didn\u2019t change my ways,\u201d he told the magazine Blues & Rhythm, the Gospel Truth in 1998. Street-corner harmonizing with fledgling vocal groups gave the youngster something for which to strive.\n\u201cEvery neighborhood had its group or groups,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would strut your stuff for the girls, but many groups were serious about actually being a group and making records. . . . The chicks would come around, and before you knew it you had three to four more girlfriends.\u201d\nMr. Williams performed in Chicago clubs with two groups, the Cavaliers and the Five Thrills. He said that after being drafted into the Navy, he frequently went AWOL to make gigs. \u201cI ran in with Navy blues or whites and the fellas had my stage clothes waitin\u2019. Then I\u2019d run out the before the Navy could drag me back.\u201d\nWhen his hitch ended in the mid-1950s, Mr. Williams decamped to Detroit. He won an amateur show that brought him to the attention of Fortune. The label\u2019s tiny studio was the backroom of a record store; stacked boxes of records served as sound baffles.\nMr. Williams\u2019s wife, the former Yvonne Jarman, died in 2004. Survivors include five children; a brother; 12 grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a perfect vocalist in order to be an artist,\u201d he once said. \u201cYou just have to have a good story.\u201d",

(Justin Mitchell/AP)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It was a scorching Mississippi day when, former police officer Cassie Barker said, she strapped her daughter Cheyenne into a car seat, cranked the vehicle&rsquo;s nonfunctioning A/C and slipped into her supervisor&rsquo;s home to have sex.</p>\n<p>Barker was inside for four hours on Sept. 30, 2016, while her 3-year-old daughter was restrained inside a police patrol car; the child&rsquo;s body temperature climbed unbearably high.</p>\n<p>The two Long Beach officers eventually fell asleep. Cheyenne was unresponsive when Barker finally returned. Authorities said her body temperature reached 107 degrees before she died.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I could ever do to you that could be worse than what you&rsquo;ve already experienced,&rdquo; Harrison County Circuit Judge Larry Bourgeois told her. &ldquo;You will forever be entombed in a prison of your own mind.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Barker avoided a second-degree murder conviction after she admitted in court that a chain of events beginning with a sexual encounter led to her daughter&rsquo;s death, the Biloxi Sun Herald <a href=\"https://www.sunherald.com/news/local/crime/article228082704.html\">reported</a>.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors recommended a 20-year sentence. Bourgeois said he would consider the punishment before an April 1 sentencing.</p>\n<p>Barker and Clark Ladner, her supervisor, were fired within days of the incident, the Associated Press <a href=\"https://apnews.com/bf7289b6574f40ba91811f82624115f9\">reported</a>. He avoided charges after he told authorities that he did not know Barker&rsquo;s child was in the car.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Every time I close my eyes, I picture her suffering, and then I picture her laying in this coffin,&rdquo; Hyer said Monday, the AP reported. &ldquo;I still see her smiling and laughing in my head, and I would assume that smile and laughter turned to pain and suffering in that instance.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hyer later learned that Barker had left their daughter in a car during a separate incident the year before.</p>\n<p>Barker went into a store in nearby Gulfport, and a concerned passerby called police. Child protective services took temporary custody of her, and Baker was suspended for a week without pay over the incident, the AP reported.</p>\n<p>But Hyer was never notified, he said. He is suing the Long Beach Police Department and the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services in a wrongful-death suit, the AP reported.</p>",

Cheyenne was unresponsive when Barker finally returned. Authorities said her body temperature reached 107 degrees before she died.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I could ever do to you that could be worse than what you\u2019ve already experienced,\u201d Harrison County Circuit Judge Larry Bourgeois told her. \u201cYou will forever be entombed in a prison of your own mind.\u201d\nBarker avoided a second-degree murder conviction after she admitted in court that a chain of events beginning with a sexual encounter led to her daughter\u2019s death, the Biloxi Sun Herald reported.\nProsecutors recommended a 20-year sentence. Bourgeois said he would consider the punishment before an April 1 sentencing.\nBarker and Clark Ladner, her supervisor, were fired within days of the incident, the Associated Press reported. He avoided charges after he told authorities that he did not know Barker\u2019s child was in the car.\n\u201cEvery time I close my eyes, I picture her suffering, and then I picture her laying in this coffin,\u201d Hyer said Monday, the AP reported. \u201cI still see her smiling and laughing in my head, and I would assume that smile and laughter turned to pain and suffering in that instance.\u201d\nHyer later learned that Barker had left their daughter in a car during a separate incident the year before.\nBarker went into a store in nearby Gulfport, and a concerned passerby called police. Child protective services took temporary custody of her, and Baker was suspended for a week without pay over the incident, the AP reported.\nBut Hyer was never notified, he said. He is suing the Long Beach Police Department and the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services in a wrongful-death suit, the AP reported.",

Thanks for waking up wth us. </em></p>\n<blockquote> <p>Beto O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s campaign says it raised $6,136,763 over the first 24 hours. <br><br>By comparison:<br><br>Bernie Sanders; $5.9m<br>Kamala Harris: $1.5 million<br>Elizabeth Warren: $300,000 <br>In about 48 hours:<br>Amy Klobuchar: $1m <br>Jay Inslee: $1m <br>John Hickenlooper: $1m<a href=\"https://t.co/bKGnHBvWHP\">https://t.co/bKGnHBvWHP</a></p></blockquote>\n<h2>Outside the Beltway</h2>\n<p><strong>SMALL BALL</strong>: The dozen or so candidates running in the 2020 Democratic primary for president aren't just competing for the right to take on Donald Trump. <strong>They're also battling each other for a slice of the money pie that is for the first time this cycle likely to be dominated by small-dollar donors.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>And they're creating even more hoops to jump through by imposing strict litmus tests on their own fundraising operations in an effort to keep them consistent with their progressive politics.</strong> That could be a big a hurdle in a crowded Democratic primary in which there is only so much money to go around, even if small donors are energized to take down President Trump.</p>\n<ul> <li> <p><strong>&ldquo;I would say that there isn&rsquo;t enough money to fully fund a dozen presidential campaigns between now and the convention,</strong> <strong>so this field will winnow down significantly between now and then,&rdquo; </strong>Tim Lim, a Democratic partner at NEWCO Stategies, told Power Up. &ldquo;However, there is enough money for three to four candidates to be fully funded till then and that alone could have major implications for the nominating process and the general election.&rdquo; </p> </li> <li> <p><strong>&ldquo;It's a totally untested notion that you can run for president without raising a lot of money from major donors,&rdquo; GOP strategist Alex Conant, partner at Firehouse Strategies, told us. &ldquo;</strong>Small-dollar donations are easy to raise when you're generating a lot of excitement. But presidential campaigns are long and expensive &mdash; and there's inevitably going to be tough stretches in any campaign where online fundraising will dip. That's when having a robust fundraising operation with major donors can be really helpful.&rdquo;</p> </li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Most major Democratic candidates are refusing to accept corporate PAC money, but Elizabeth Warren, for instance,</strong><a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/02/elizabeth-warren-campaign-finance-fundraiser-donors-democratic-primary/\"><strong> is going a step furthe</strong>r</a> by eschewing all private fundraisers and donor calls, as well as rejecting money from any PAC and all lobbyists. Candidates<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/candidates-reach-for-the-magic-ticket-to-democratic-debates-65000-donors/2019/03/19/9a1f80e0-4a4b-11e9-9663-00ac73f49662_story.html?utm_term=.d2ead01989e2\"> must also attract</a> 65,000 individual donors to make the debate stage &mdash; or hit 1 percent in public polling, as my colleague Michael Scherer reports.</p>\n<p><strong>It's a risky strategy that has so far not paid off financially. During the first 24 hours of their campaigns:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li>Warren raised at least $300,000 from 8,000 donors and admitted in an email to supporters, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-donors-fundraising.html\">&ldquo;We're falling short.&rdquo;</a></li> </ul>\n<p><strong>The Democratic primary, simply on the basis of diversity, is already defying some of the crustier, conventional campaign norms &mdash; a trickle-down effect from progressives who ran in the 2018 midterms and a reaction to Hillary Clinton's 2016 pitfalls as the Democratic nominee. </strong></p>\n<ul> <li>&ldquo;I think that what candidates are measuring is the potential impact of the perceived hit that Clinton took for all the Goldman Sachs stuff that allowed Bernie to define her as the establishment candidate that had general election consequences,&rdquo; a Democratic operative explained to Power Up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone has an illusions that you&rsquo;ll get points for the way you take money. So it&rsquo;s become a trap to be avoided rather than a positive point.&rdquo;</li> </ul>\n<p>The trend is bound to continue as 2020 Democrats want their values reflected in the composition and mechanisms of their campaign &mdash; from staffing to fundraising to advertising. (Read the New York Times's Astead Herndon's <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/us/politics/2020-democrats-activism.html\">piece</a> on efforts to diversify staff.)</p>\n<ul> <li> <p><strong>&ldquo;Putting people first is a message that wins across the political spectrum and it's really hard to do that when you&rsquo;re spending your time and energy courting corporate interests and corporate donors,&rdquo; Rep. Katie Porter </strong>(D-Calif.), a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/14/wall-streets-newest-threat-is-house-freshman-youve-probably-never-heard/?utm_term=.9654183a9532\">Warren protege</a>, former law professor and one-time bankruptcy lawyer for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who won her 2018 race without accepting money from corporate donors, told Power Up.</p> </li> <li> <p>&ldquo;How they raise money, that&rsquo;s going to help increase people&rsquo;s confidence in their authenticity and help them build trust,&rdquo; she added.</p> </li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Rethinking the way Democrats engage in the so called &ldquo;money primary&rdquo; has been central to the transformation, even if it's risky. </strong></p>\n<ul> <li><strong>&ldquo;I want to run a campaign that's based on principles and ideas, not on how much money I can scoop up from people who have already made it big,&rdquo; Warren told Power Up. </strong>&ldquo;This is a chance in a Democratic primary for us to do exactly that. To build the kind of grass roots movement, person to person, face to face, neighbor to neighbor across the country.&rdquo;</li> <li> <p><strong>Warren's campaign passed along evidence of the time saved from scrapping time-consuming fundraising rituals:</strong> She's completed &quot;29 hours doing 34 selfie lines, interacting with 10,000 people&rdquo; and has had events in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, California, New York, Texas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Puerto Rico and Alabama,&rdquo; per a Warren aide. </p> </li> <li> <p>&ldquo;There's a big advantage to being able to spend your time campaigning, instead of fundraising. It really helped Trump in 2015 and 2016 that he didn't have to spend time raising money like his competitors in the primary,&rdquo; Conant said, referring to Trump raking in an &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-shatters-gop-records-with-small-donors-228338\">unprecedented deluge of small-dollar donations for the GOP.&rdquo;</a> </p> </li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Of course, Democrats like Warren will only have to worry about ginning up enough cash to win the bruising Democratic primary.</strong> The winner of the Democratic nomination is all-but-assured to have a gigantic outside fundraising machine behind them in the form of outside groups and super PACs hungry to oust Trump.</p>\n<ul> <li>Just yesterday, the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA launched &ldquo;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/snt0Ac7ieQc\">it's first digital ad </a>campaign of the 2020 election cycle Tuesday after pledging to spend $100 million on early efforts in key battleground states,&rdquo; CNN's David Wright <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/19/politics/priorities-usa-first-digital-ad-campaign-trump-2020/index.html\">reports. </a></li> </ul>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/snt0Ac7ieQc?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><strong>There are also Democrats who want to win at all costs &mdash; even if that means accepting big money.</strong> That includes the congressional staffer who told me over lunch yesterday that he just wants to beat Trump at all costs to the all-but-announced candidate, Joe Biden, who has reached out to supporters for &ldquo;help in lining up contributions from major donors so he can quickly raise several million dollars,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal's Emily Glazer and Ken Thomas <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-biden-tells-supporters-he-plans-2020-bid-11553033380?mod=e2tw\">report</a>.</p>\n<ul> <li>&ldquo;Mr. Biden has expressed concern to these people that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to raise millions of dollars in online donations immediately the way some other Democratic candidates have, including [Beto] and [Bernie],&quot; a source told Glazer and Thomas. </li> </ul>\n<p><strong>This concern is not without cause:</strong> Trump has the obvious advantage of running as the lone Republican candidate in an open field with full control of the party's operations and resources, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@bpimedia/the-2020-landscape-trumps-digital-head-start-fcf540110e1f\">has already outspent</a> by nine-to-one the top-spending Democratic candidates in the first two months of 2019, Warren and Kamala Harris.</p>\n<ul> <li> <p><strong>&ldquo;Money is money,&rdquo;</strong> Lim told us. &ldquo;And that is the number one thing you need to keep a campaign afloat.

Conway explained he views his Trump subtweets as a way to vent and help his marriage.</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so maddening to watch,&rdquo; </strong>Conway told The Post. &ldquo;The mendacity, the incompetence, it&rsquo;s just maddening to watch. The tweeting is just the way to get it out of the way, so I can get it off my chest and move on with my life that day. That&rsquo;s basically it. <strong>Frankly, it&rsquo;s so I don&rsquo;t end up screaming at her about it.&rdquo; </strong></li> <li><strong>Reminder: </strong>Kellyanne Conway, George's wife and a White House aide,<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/she-works-for-trump-he-cant-stand-him-this-is-life-with-kellyanne-and-george-conway/2018/08/15/3b89b82a-9b46-11e8-843b-36e177f3081c_story.html?utm_term=.33ade8118e12\"> tried to go off the record</a> with our colleague Ben Terris last August to say she thought her husband's tweets were &quot;disrespectful ... a violation of basic decency, certainly, if not marital vows.&quot;</li> <li> Dawsey dug up an amazing anecdote from a party at the British embassy last month in which Kellyanne Conway vented to a group that included ex-Postie Sally Quinn and the Times's Maureen Dowd. Kellyanne Conway said she and Trump think her husband is jealous of her standing and that George Conway preferred to &quot;spend his time in front of his computer, while she preferred to socialize, the attendees said. She said it was the fault of the news media for giving her husband such a platform, and that some of George Conway&rsquo;s close friends had asked him to stop.&rdquo; </li> <li>George Conway declined to comment when Dawsey asked him about the state of their marriage, <strong>&ldquo;answering only that he wished his wife did not work for the White House.&rdquo;</strong></li> </ul>\n<p><strong>One of George Conway's recent tweets:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BETO &amp; AMY O'ROURKE: </strong>On the other side of the aisle, Beto and Amy O'Rourke <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2019/03/19/feature/are-amy-and-beto-orourke-the-future-of-politics/?utm_term=.0d5e67b7be4d\">told our colleague Ben Terris all about their marriage</a> in an age when it's no longer a given that a man will be on a ballot and a woman will take care of everything at home.</p>\n<ul> <li>O'Rourke has already had to apologize for the new normal, when he joked he only &quot;sometimes&quot; helps raise his three kids, a remark his wife reportedly found &quot;flip.&quot; But Amy O'Rourke went even further in upending traditional roles by chiding negative coverage of her husband for not quickly getting a new job after being unemployed for the first time in decades when he failed to beat Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in 2018.</li> <li><strong>&ldquo;People were saying, &lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t he get a job to support his family,&rsquo; and I was like, &lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t I be the one? I&rsquo;m working,&rsquo; </strong>&rdquo; Amy told our colleague, noting she does part-time work as a consultant on education issues.</li> <li>Amy O'Rourke, who previously ran a charter school, added she just finished reading Michelle Obama's &quot;Becoming&quot; and shares the former first lady's feeling that she's never aspired to live in the White House.</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Friends describe Amy O'Rourke as a moderating influence</strong>, pointing to the fact that after her husband said El Paso should tear down its border wall that she advised him to rein in his rhetoric. During the midterms, Amy also reminded her husband that his casual profanity might turn off some Texans. As for the former congressman and now top-tier presidential candidate, Ben found multiple examples of Beto's &quot;impulsive and puckish&quot; streak --- especially when it comes to pranks:</p>\n<ul> <li> &ldquo;The remote-controlled cockroach in the kitchen, the 'Psycho'-style scares in the shower. <strong>One time, according to a friend, Beto collected an especially verdant turd from one of their kids&rsquo; diapers</strong> and put it in a bowl, telling Amy it was avocado. (Neither would confirm this, though Beto did allow it sounded like something he&rsquo;d do.)&rdquo;</li> </ul>\n<figure><img data-no-process=\"data-no-process\" src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https%3A%2F%2Farc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2FMUN6INSKQQI6TDH4FROQTGOCDY.jpg&w=908\"></img></figure>\n<h2>From the Courts</h2>\n<p><strong>TRUMP KEEPS LOSING . . .

All four judges said essentially the same thing: that the government&rsquo;s stated reason for ending DACA &mdash; that it was unlawful &mdash; was 'virtually unexplained,' as U.S. District Judge John D. Bates, an appointee of President George W. Bush in Washington, said in an April opinion.&rdquo; </li> </ul>\n<h2>The Investigations</h2>\n<p><strong>ANOTHER SIGN MUELLER IS ALMOST DONE?:</strong> Prosecutors with special counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s team asked a judge to give them until April 1 to respond to a request from The Post to unseal records related to Paul Manafort.

That could be a big a hurdle in a crowded Democratic primary in which there is only so much money to go around, even if small donors are energized to take down President Trump.\n\u201cI would say that there isn\u2019t enough money to fully fund a dozen presidential campaigns between now and the convention, so this field will winnow down significantly between now and then,\u201d Tim Lim, a Democratic partner at NEWCO Stategies, told Power Up. \u201cHowever, there is enough money for three to four candidates to be fully funded till then and that alone could have major implications for the nominating process and the general election.\u201d\n\u201cIt's a totally untested notion that you can run for president without raising a lot of money from major donors,\u201d GOP strategist Alex Conant, partner at Firehouse Strategies, told us. \u201cSmall-dollar donations are easy to raise when you're generating a lot of excitement. But presidential campaigns are long and expensive \u2014 and there's inevitably going to be tough stretches in any campaign where online fundraising will dip. That's when having a robust fundraising operation with major donors can be really helpful.\u201d\nMost major Democratic candidates are refusing to accept corporate PAC money, but Elizabeth Warren, for instance, is going a step further by eschewing all private fundraisers and donor calls, as well as rejecting money from any PAC and all lobbyists. Candidates must also attract 65,000 individual donors to make the debate stage \u2014 or hit 1 percent in public polling, as my colleague Michael Scherer reports.\nIt's a risky strategy that has so far not paid off financially. During the first 24 hours of their campaigns:\nWarren raised at least $300,000 from 8,000 donors and admitted in an email to supporters, \u201cWe're falling short.\u201d\nThe Democratic primary, simply on the basis of diversity, is already defying some of the crustier, conventional campaign norms \u2014 a trickle-down effect from progressives who ran in the 2018 midterms and a reaction to Hillary Clinton's 2016 pitfalls as the Democratic nominee.\n\u201cI think that what candidates are measuring is the potential impact of the perceived hit that Clinton took for all the Goldman Sachs stuff that allowed Bernie to define her as the establishment candidate that had general election consequences,\u201d a Democratic operative explained to Power Up. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has an illusions that you\u2019ll get points for the way you take money. So it\u2019s become a trap to be avoided rather than a positive point.\u201d\nThe trend is bound to continue as 2020 Democrats want their values reflected in the composition and mechanisms of their campaign \u2014 from staffing to fundraising to advertising. (Read the New York Times's Astead Herndon's piece on efforts to diversify staff.)\n\u201cPutting people first is a message that wins across the political spectrum and it's really hard to do that when you\u2019re spending your time and energy courting corporate interests and corporate donors,\u201d Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), a Warren protege, former law professor and one-time bankruptcy lawyer for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who won her 2018 race without accepting money from corporate donors, told Power Up.\n\u201cHow they raise money, that\u2019s going to help increase people\u2019s confidence in their authenticity and help them build trust,\u201d she added.\nRethinking the way Democrats engage in the so called \u201cmoney primary\u201d has been central to the transformation, even if it's risky.\n\u201cI want to run a campaign that's based on principles and ideas, not on how much money I can scoop up from people who have already made it big,\u201d Warren told Power Up. \u201cThis is a chance in a Democratic primary for us to do exactly that. To build the kind of grass roots movement, person to person, face to face, neighbor to neighbor across the country.\u201d\nWarren's campaign passed along evidence of the time saved from scrapping time-consuming fundraising rituals: She's completed \"29 hours doing 34 selfie lines, interacting with 10,000 people\u201d and has had events in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, California, New York, Texas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Puerto Rico and Alabama,\u201d per a Warren aide.\n\u201cThere's a big advantage to being able to spend your time campaigning, instead of fundraising. It really helped Trump in 2015 and 2016 that he didn't have to spend time raising money like his competitors in the primary,\u201d Conant said, referring to Trump raking in an \u201cunprecedented deluge of small-dollar donations for the GOP.\u201d\nOf course, Democrats like Warren will only have to worry about ginning up enough cash to win the bruising Democratic primary. The winner of the Democratic nomination is all-but-assured to have a gigantic outside fundraising machine behind them in the form of outside groups and super PACs hungry to oust Trump.\nJust yesterday, the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA launched \u201cit's first digital ad campaign of the 2020 election cycle Tuesday after pledging to spend $100 million on early efforts in key battleground states,\u201d CNN's David Wright reports.\nThere are also Democrats who want to win at all costs \u2014 even if that means accepting big money. That includes the congressional staffer who told me over lunch yesterday that he just wants to beat Trump at all costs to the all-but-announced candidate, Joe Biden, who has reached out to supporters for \u201chelp in lining up contributions from major donors so he can quickly raise several million dollars,\u201d the Wall Street Journal's Emily Glazer and Ken Thomas report.\n\u201cMr. Biden has expressed concern to these people that he wouldn\u2019t be able to raise millions of dollars in online donations immediately the way some other Democratic candidates have, including [Beto] and [Bernie],\" a source told Glazer and Thomas.\nThis concern is not without cause: Trump has the obvious advantage of running as the lone Republican candidate in an open field with full control of the party's operations and resources, and has already outspent by nine-to-one the top-spending Democratic candidates in the first two months of 2019, Warren and Kamala Harris.\n\u201cMoney is money,\u201d Lim told us. \u201cAnd that is the number one thing you need to keep a campaign afloat. So you can\u2019t diminish the money raised \u2014 it\u2019s eye popping to raise $6 million one day and $20 million in a quarter online ... those numbers will play a key role in whether or not a candidate has the resources to get through the primaries.\u201d\n\u201cThe problem is most extreme for the lesser candidates at this point who haven\u2019t had time to build up a strong donor base and [the] only way to have resources to stay in the race is a couple of affluent people who want to take a bet on them winning,\u201d the Democratic strategist told us. \u201cAnd for those candidates, I don\u2019t see them moving ahead without that kind of operation.\u201d\nAn aide to Warren noted that \u201cshe does not believe in unilateral disarmament for the general election.\u201d\nYet:\nThe Democratic Party is the party of the people \u2013 not the billionaires & giant corporations. So all Democratic candidates in the 2020 presidential primary should disavow Super PACs & no self-funding. Period. Add your name now if you agree. https://t.co/A6l1BnjSir pic.twitter.com/tA2UCersjx\n\u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 10, 2019\nThe People\nT.M.I., POLITICAL COUPLES ED.: \u201cMr. Kellyanne Conway\u201d defended himself against the commander-in-chief after Trump and his campaign manager Brad Parscale teamed up on Twitter to call George Conway, the husband of one of Trump's top advisers, a \"total loser.\"\nThe Conway Whisperer: In an interview with our colleague Josh Dawsey, George Conway reiterated his concerns expressed in recent tweets about Trump's mental health. Conway explained he views his Trump subtweets as a way to vent and help his marriage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so maddening to watch,\u201d Conway told The Post. \u201cThe mendacity, the incompetence, it\u2019s just maddening to watch. The tweeting is just the way to get it out of the way, so I can get it off my chest and move on with my life that day. That\u2019s basically it. Frankly, it\u2019s so I don\u2019t end up screaming at her about it.\u201d\nReminder: Kellyanne Conway, George's wife and a White House aide, tried to go off the record with our colleague Ben Terris last August to say she thought her husband's tweets were \"disrespectful ... a violation of basic decency, certainly, if not marital vows.\"\nDawsey dug up an amazing anecdote from a party at the British embassy last month in which Kellyanne Conway vented to a group that included ex-Postie Sally Quinn and the Times's Maureen Dowd. Kellyanne Conway said she and Trump think her husband is jealous of her standing and that George Conway preferred to \"spend his time in front of his computer, while she preferred to socialize, the attendees said. She said it was the fault of the news media for giving her husband such a platform, and that some of George Conway\u2019s close friends had asked him to stop.\u201d\nGeorge Conway declined to comment when Dawsey asked him about the state of their marriage, \u201canswering only that he wished his wife did not work for the White House.\u201d\nOne of George Conway's recent tweets:\nBETO & AMY O'ROURKE: On the other side of the aisle, Beto and Amy O'Rourke told our colleague Ben Terris all about their marriage in an age when it's no longer a given that a man will be on a ballot and a woman will take care of everything at home.\nO'Rourke has already had to apologize for the new normal, when he joked he only \"sometimes\" helps raise his three kids, a remark his wife reportedly found \"flip.\" But Amy O'Rourke went even further in upending traditional roles by chiding negative coverage of her husband for not quickly getting a new job after being unemployed for the first time in decades when he failed to beat Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in 2018.\n\u201cPeople were saying, \u2018Why can\u2019t he get a job to support his family,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Why can\u2019t I be the one? I\u2019m working,\u2019 \u201d Amy told our colleague, noting she does part-time work as a consultant on education issues.\nAmy O'Rourke, who previously ran a charter school, added she just finished reading Michelle Obama's \"Becoming\" and shares the former first lady's feeling that she's never aspired to live in the White House.\nFriends describe Amy O'Rourke as a moderating influence, pointing to the fact that after her husband said El Paso should tear down its border wall that she advised him to rein in his rhetoric. During the midterms, Amy also reminded her husband that his casual profanity might turn off some Texans. As for the former congressman and now top-tier presidential candidate, Ben found multiple examples of Beto's \"impulsive and puckish\" streak --- especially when it comes to pranks:\n\u201cThe remote-controlled cockroach in the kitchen, the 'Psycho'-style scares in the shower. One time, according to a friend, Beto collected an especially verdant turd from one of their kids\u2019 diapers and put it in a bowl, telling Amy it was avocado. (Neither would confirm this, though Beto did allow it sounded like something he\u2019d do.)\u201d\nFrom the Courts\nTRUMP KEEPS LOSING . . . IN FEDERAL COURT: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made stacking the federal bench with conservative judges a top priority. But in the meantime the Trump administration continues to lose key legal battles because judges say officials are failing to do the most basic of things.\nOur colleagues Fred Barbash and Deanna Paul report the Trump administration has lost in federal court at least 63 times over the past two years because officials are failing to provide things like \u201clegitimate explanations supported by facts and, where required, public input.\u201d\nIt's the tweets: Trump himself is making the matter worse with his constant tweeting; our colleagues found that at least a dozen court decisions have referenced the president's tweets or comments.\nFact Check: The president likes to blame the losses on \u201cObama judges,\u201d but Fred and Deanna report that on major issues where multiple judges have ruled, it hasn\u2019t matter where the judges are based or which president appointed them.\nExample: \u201cFour judges, for instance, have rejected the decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has protected from deportation nearly 700,000 people brought to the United States as children. All four judges said essentially the same thing: that the government\u2019s stated reason for ending DACA \u2014 that it was unlawful \u2014 was 'virtually unexplained,' as U.S. District Judge John D. Bates, an appointee of President George W. Bush in Washington, said in an April opinion.\u201d\nThe Investigations\nANOTHER SIGN MUELLER IS ALMOST DONE?: Prosecutors with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team asked a judge to give them until April 1 to respond to a request from The Post to unseal records related to Paul Manafort. They cited \u201cthe press of other work,\u201d our colleagues report.\nThe news comes as every minute development is being scrutinized as foretelling the possible end of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and any connection to Trump campaign aides.\n\u201cThe Post has objected to the abundance of sealed and redacted records in Manafort\u2019s Washington case and petitioned the judge in his case, Amy Berman Jackson, to open them to public view,\u201d Spencer S. Hsu and Matt Zapotosky report.\nThat being said there continue to be signs that things are wrapping, including the reported imminent departure from the team of top prosecutor Andrew Weissmann.\nViral\nPLAYING CATCH UP: Fewer than 200 people watched the alleged New Zealand gunman\u2019s live-stream of the massacre at two mosques on Facebook and the company says that its moderators removed the video 29 minutes after the stream began. But as our colleague Drew Harwell reports, the horrific video still ended up reaching millions, the latest sign of tech companies\u2019 struggle against users who harness the sheer speed of their platforms to spread vile content.\nDrew reported that Facebook found more than 1.5 million copies of the video were uploaded within 24 hours. Facebook said that 1.2 million videos were blocked at the time of upload by moderators or automated algorithms, but has not commented on how many people viewed, commented on or reacted to footage that broke through those safeguards.\nBeyond Facebook, YouTube officials told The Post \u201ca new copy was being uploaded every second.\u201d The original stream was posted on a site \u201cknown as a haven for far-right extremism and hate speech,\u201d as users exchanged tips and egged each other on to find ways to ensure the video would not be blocked for good.\nIMPOSSIBLE OR JUST REALLY HARD?: Drew tells Power Up that lawmakers and executives are still grappling with the big question of how or if they can contain, moderate or quash graphic or distressing content traveling at the \u201cspeed of the Web.\u201d Drew writes:\n\u201cEveryone agrees it\u2019s a huge problem that a white-nationalist mass-murder video can take off on the same websites where kids watch cartoons.\n\u201cNow the big question for tech (and Washington): Is it an impossible problem, or just really, really hard?\n\u201cTech is trying \u2014 they do care. But every shooting, they come up short. We need to understand why one of the most cash-rich industries in America, with our top engineering minds, keeps getting outmatched by anonymous trolls. They can't solve for every human darkness, but they should be accountable for the ideas and information they propel around the web. Otherwise, this keeps happening,\u201d Drew told us.",

Of those respondents, 44 percent attributed the colder weather to climate change. Nearly 4 in 10, 37 percent, thought the same in 2015, and 29 percent did so in 2014.</p>\n<p>Similarly, 70 percent of those Americans who reported higher-than-usual temperatures this year blamed those usually mild conditions on climate change. That's up significantly from 2012, when 38 percent of such respondents saw global warming as responsible for the balmier conditions.</p>\n<p>Of course, people's prior beliefs about climate change seem to color their perceptions of how weird was the winter weather.</p>\n<p>&quot;Those who worry a great deal or fair amount about global warming are more likely to report experiencing warmer than usual winter weather than those worried only a little or not at all,&quot; Saad said. &quot;The finding is similar for the perception that winter is colder than usual.&quot;</p>\n<p>And human beings in general are much less reliable measurers of temperature than a regular-old mercury thermometer.</p>\n<p>According to Gallup, Americans were more likely to say they went through a colder-than-average winter rather than a warmer-than-average one. But the reality is that the United States had above-average temperatures between December 2018 and February 2019, <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news/us-records-wettest-winter-capped-by-cooler-wetter-february-2019\">according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>.</p>\n<p>That discrepancy may be due to the timing of survey. It was conducted during the first 10 days of March, immediately after a February that clocked in <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news/us-records-wettest-winter-capped-by-cooler-wetter-february-2019\">1.8 degrees below average</a>. The Midwest was in the middle of that &ldquo;polar vortex&rdquo; freeze at the start of the month.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;February seems to be what people have in mind when they answer in March,&quot; Saad said. She added that parts of December were so warm near her home in Connecticut that she sent her kids to school in shorts.</p>\n<p>Gallup's results are part of its annual report on Americans' attitudes about climate change, which will be released in full next week.</p>\n<p>Yet President Trump is pointing to the low thermometer reading as a sign that man-made climate change is not happening. In January, for example, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1090074254010404864\">tweeted</a>: &ldquo;In the beautiful Midwest, wind chill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can&rsquo;t last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Yet, as counterintuitive as it may sound, there is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/01/29/trump-always-dismisses-climate-change-when-its-cold-not-so-fast-experts-say/\">heated debate</a> among climate scientists over whether those extreme cold snaps &mdash; such as the one that rolled through the United States in January &mdash; are due to rising temperatures in the Arctic.</p>\n<p>The idea is that the lack of sea ice up north destabilizes the jet stream that encircles the Arctic, causing the river of air to dip farther to the south and deliver a punch of cold polar wind to low latitudes. As more Americans hear about that theory, still not fully accepted by all climate scientists, more may be associating the cold snaps with climate change.</p>\n<p>Other <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/01/23/the-energy-202-year-from-hell-means-more-americans-are-taking-climate-change-personally-new-polling-shows/5c4778141b326b29c3778c6f/\">recent polling</a> show Americans increasingly noticing what they think are the effects of climate change around them following recent torrential hurricanes and massive wildfires &mdash; weather events scientists know with more certainty are made worse by warming temperatures.</p>\n<p>According to a University of Chicago survey, for example, of the respondents that said they found the climate science more convincing than they did five years ago, three-quarters of them acknowledged that recent hurricanes, floods, droughts and unusual heat influenced their views.</p>\n<p>That effect can even be felt in GOP-leaning North Carolina.

Recently confirmed Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler told CBS News that &ldquo;drinking water today worldwide is probably the biggest environmental threat we have&quot; and is &ldquo;a crisis that I think we can solve.&rdquo; He told the network the climate change is &ldquo;an important change we have to be addressing and we are addressing,&rdquo; but said &ldquo;most of the threats from climate change are 50-75 years out.&rdquo; &ldquo;What we need to do is make sure that the people who are dying today from the lack of having drinking water in third world countries &ndash; that problem is addressed,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p><strong>&mdash; What Trump&rsquo;s budget does to science: </strong>More details have been made public about how Trump&rsquo;s budget request could impact the National Science Foundation, the agency that provides a quarter of all federal funding for basic research, The Post&rsquo;s Ben Guarino <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/03/19/trumps-budget-slashes-science-heres-what-would-be-lost/?utm_term=.c080a208c33a\">reports</a>. The 12 percent reduction would mean 1,000 fewer grants in 2020, and 400 fewer graduate students than its fellowship program funded last year. The budget proposal would cut research funding in 2020 for the biological sciences, computer sciences, engineering and social sciences by a tenth compared with 2019 levels. Geosciences, mathematical and physical sciences funding would be cut by 15 percent, and polar programs by almost 20 percent. But there are some proposed increases, such as for artificial intelligence research as well as for funding for advanced manufacturing, semiconductors and microelectronics.</p>\n<p><strong>Some GOP lawmakers have pushed back on proposed energy and environmental cuts:</strong> &ldquo;[White House officials] make some proposals in there that they know we&rsquo;re not going to go along with,&rdquo; said Rep.

                "text": "THE LIGHTBULB\nThis winter, temperatures plunged so low in the Midwest \u2014 at times below minus-50 degrees \u2014 that mail service stalled, airline gas lines froze and Chicago set parts of its commuter rail on fire to stop the bone-deep chill from damaging the tracks.\nFew would blame those gripped by the cold for not thinking very much about global warming.\nYet some of them were.\nNew polling shows that one in three Americans blamed unusual winter temperatures on Earth's changing climate.\nThe survey, published by Gallup on Tuesday, indicates U.S. residents are becoming more likely to attribute unusual weather in their own backyards \u2014 including even that teeth-chattering cold this winter \u2014 to broader global changes in the planet's climate because of human activity.\nIt also comes at a time when politicians in Washington seem to be talking more about federal action to stop climate change than they have in a decade, with many Democratic presidential contenders rallying around creating a Green New Deal.\n\u201cWe talk a lot about people's belief in global warming,\u201d said Lydia Saad, a senior editor at Gallup. \u201cBut this brings it down to a bit more of a personal experience.\u201d\n\u201cThis is kind of where the rubber meets the road,\u201d she added.\nForty-three percent of Americans said temperatures were colder than usual this winter, according to Gallup. Of those respondents, 44 percent attributed the colder weather to climate change. Nearly 4 in 10, 37 percent, thought the same in 2015, and 29 percent did so in 2014.\nSimilarly, 70 percent of those Americans who reported higher-than-usual temperatures this year blamed those usually mild conditions on climate change. That's up significantly from 2012, when 38 percent of such respondents saw global warming as responsible for the balmier conditions.\nOf course, people's prior beliefs about climate change seem to color their perceptions of how weird was the winter weather.\n\"Those who worry a great deal or fair amount about global warming are more likely to report experiencing warmer than usual winter weather than those worried only a little or not at all,\" Saad said. \"The finding is similar for the perception that winter is colder than usual.\"\nAnd human beings in general are much less reliable measurers of temperature than a regular-old mercury thermometer.\nAccording to Gallup, Americans were more likely to say they went through a colder-than-average winter rather than a warmer-than-average one. But the reality is that the United States had above-average temperatures between December 2018 and February 2019, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThat discrepancy may be due to the timing of survey. It was conducted during the first 10 days of March, immediately after a February that clocked in 1.8 degrees below average. The Midwest was in the middle of that \u201cpolar vortex\u201d freeze at the start of the month.\n\u201cFebruary seems to be what people have in mind when they answer in March,\" Saad said. She added that parts of December were so warm near her home in Connecticut that she sent her kids to school in shorts.\nGallup's results are part of its annual report on Americans' attitudes about climate change, which will be released in full next week.\nYet President Trump is pointing to the low thermometer reading as a sign that man-made climate change is not happening. In January, for example, he tweeted: \u201cIn the beautiful Midwest, wind chill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can\u2019t last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you!\u201d\nYet, as counterintuitive as it may sound, there is heated debate among climate scientists over whether those extreme cold snaps \u2014 such as the one that rolled through the United States in January \u2014 are due to rising temperatures in the Arctic.\nThe idea is that the lack of sea ice up north destabilizes the jet stream that encircles the Arctic, causing the river of air to dip farther to the south and deliver a punch of cold polar wind to low latitudes. As more Americans hear about that theory, still not fully accepted by all climate scientists, more may be associating the cold snaps with climate change.\nOther recent polling show Americans increasingly noticing what they think are the effects of climate change around them following recent torrential hurricanes and massive wildfires \u2014 weather events scientists know with more certainty are made worse by warming temperatures.\nAccording to a University of Chicago survey, for example, of the respondents that said they found the climate science more convincing than they did five years ago, three-quarters of them acknowledged that recent hurricanes, floods, droughts and unusual heat influenced their views.\nThat effect can even be felt in GOP-leaning North Carolina. After two major hurricanes in the past three years brought devastating floods to the state, an Elon University poll last year found that 37 percent of Republicans there believe global warming is \u201cvery likely\u201d to hurt North Carolina's coastal communities over the next half-century \u2014 nearly triple the number of Republicans who said the same in 2017.\n\u201cI always thought climate change was a bunch of nonsense,\u201d one Trump-supporting North Carolinian told The Post's Tracy Jan last year. \u201cBut now I really do think it is happening.\u201d\nThe head of the @EPA is expected to announce today that he believes water safety is a bigger environmental crisis than climate change. @MajorCBS sat down with EPA administrator @EPAAWheeler in his first TV interview since being confirmed: https://t.co/zg0NIiLQOB pic.twitter.com/4Rq3iLy5ma\n\u2014 Trump's EPA chief defines \"the biggest environmental threat we have\": And it's not climate change. Recently confirmed Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler told CBS News that \u201cdrinking water today worldwide is probably the biggest environmental threat we have\" and is \u201ca crisis that I think we can solve.\u201d He told the network the climate change is \u201can important change we have to be addressing and we are addressing,\u201d but said \u201cmost of the threats from climate change are 50-75 years out.\u201d \u201cWhat we need to do is make sure that the people who are dying today from the lack of having drinking water in third world countries \u2013 that problem is addressed,\u201d he added.\n\u2014 What Trump\u2019s budget does to science: More details have been made public about how Trump\u2019s budget request could impact the National Science Foundation, the agency that provides a quarter of all federal funding for basic research, The Post\u2019s Ben Guarino reports. The 12 percent reduction would mean 1,000 fewer grants in 2020, and 400 fewer graduate students than its fellowship program funded last year. The budget proposal would cut research funding in 2020 for the biological sciences, computer sciences, engineering and social sciences by a tenth compared with 2019 levels. Geosciences, mathematical and physical sciences funding would be cut by 15 percent, and polar programs by almost 20 percent. But there are some proposed increases, such as for artificial intelligence research as well as for funding for advanced manufacturing, semiconductors and microelectronics.\nSome GOP lawmakers have pushed back on proposed energy and environmental cuts: \u201c[White House officials] make some proposals in there that they know we\u2019re not going to go along with,\u201d said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), the ranking Republican of the House Appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development, according to Bloomberg Environment. \u201cElections have consequences, and the bills we write are going to be more in the Democratic mold,\u201d he added.\n\u2014 FERC nominee derailed: Energy Secretary Rick Perry and major coal companies worked to convince the president not to nominate a prominent lawyer for a spot on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission because he had been publicly critical of the administration\u2019s proposal to help struggling coal power plants. David Hill, who served as general counsel for the Energy Department in the George W. Bush administration was a likely candidate for the post, Politico reported, but he said his nomination process has ended. \u201cHe had been expected to fill the vacancy created by former FERC Chairman Kevin McIntyre's death in January,\u201d according to Politico. \u201cBut the parallel efforts by Perry and the coal industry proved to be more persuasive with Trump than his chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who was lobbying for Hill.\u201d\n\u2014 Oregon lawmakers pass fracking ban: The state\u2019s House of Representatives voted 42 to 12 to pass a 10-year ban on the process in the state, a measure that will now head to the state Senate for consideration. While there\u2019s no existing fracking operations in the state, \u201cdevelopers say there's potential for coalbed methane extraction in the Willamette Valley, which this bill would also block,\u201d the Associated Press reports.\n\u2014 Much of the Midwest has been ravaged by floodwaters: The massive late-winter storm that battered much of the Midwest has left widespread destruction in the region and has killed at least four people. Vice President Pence, who visited Nebraska to survey the storm-ravaged region, vowed presidential disaster declarations would be expedited to help impacted states.\nStill, some areas are preparing for more impending destruction. \u201cWhile floodwaters remain steady in some areas and recede in others, some regions are bracing for \u2018major to historic and catastrophic\u2019 flooding to come as rivers vault toward their crests this week, fed by rapid snowmelt throughout the Missouri and Mississippi River basins, the National Weather Service said,\u201d The Post\u2019s Alex Horton reports.\nThe flooding is hitting Nebraska's farms particularly hard: Early estimates show ranching losses in Nebraska will hit $500 million and row-crop losses at another $400 million. \u201cFor livestock, the loss is a combination of animal deaths and loss of productivity (when it\u2019s cold, cattle and calves don\u2019t grow as fast) as well as loss of quality feed sources,\u201d The Post\u2019s Laura Reiley reports. \u201cFor row crops, [Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson] explained, farmers are very close to planting season, and fear they won\u2019t have enough time to clean up the land.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m 39 years old; I don\u2019t have children. The cows are my children, and my farm is completely destroyed. Maybe it\u2019s a sign from God to go and do something else,\u201d fifth-generation Nebraska rancher Anthony Ruzicka told The Post.\n\u2014 Notorious fish that caught fire now safe to eat: The Environmental Protection Agency gave the green light to ease consumption restrictions on a fish from the Cuyahoga River in Ohio, infamous for catching fire in Cleveland in 1969 because of water pollution. \u201cThis is an example of the progress that can be achieved when you collaborate and dedicate resources to improving the quality of water in our state,\u201d Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said in a statement. \u201cThe Cuyahoga River was already one of the most polluted rivers in the country at the time of the fire on June 22, 1969 . . . The fire was neither the first nor the worst the river had experienced,\u201d the Associated Press reports. \u201cBut the 1969 fire on the river, where industrial waste and sewage were regularly dumped, drew national media attention that made it an instant poster child for water pollution at a time when the country was becoming more environmentally aware.\u201d\n\u2014 More river news, Potomac edition: The Potomac Riverkeeper Network announced it will start monitoring water quality at six different points along the river to provide public data that and help people decide whether it\u2019s safe enough to swim, The Post\u2019s Marissa J. Lang reports. The information will be uploaded to a website and app, Swim Guide, that tracks weather and water quality at 7,000 beaches worldwide. \u201cIn the District, the Department of Health bars swimming in the river,\u201d Lang writes. \u201cIt\u2019s not outlawed in Virginia or Maryland. But, as Potomac riverkeeper Dean Naujoks said, no one knows what the river quality is day-to-day or even week-to-week.\u201d\n\u2014 The petrochemical plant blaze in Texas is out: A fire that broke out on Sunday at a petrochemical storage site near Houston has been extinguished, CBS Newsreports. Intercontinental Terminals Company has been monitoring air quality at its facility and said readings are \u201cwell below hazardous levels.\u201d The head of the county\u2019s health department said Tuesday there \u201ccontinues to be a low risk to our community.\nToday\nThe Atlantic Council holds an event on geopolitics, energy security and the U.S.-Japan alliance.\nComing Up\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission holds a meeting on Thursday.\n\u2014 The flooding from above: The Post graphics team on the satellite images showing the catastrophic flooding in the Midwest.",

The thread went viral, partly because of my name. But I suspect it would be far harder to get that reaction if my last name were Procter or Gamble. That&rsquo;s because the Disney brand occupies a special place in our economic landscape. Its profits are powered by emotion and sentiment and, yes, something as fundamental as the difference between right and wrong. I believe that Disney could well lead the way, if its leaders so chose, to a more decent, humane way of doing business.</p>\n<p>I had to speak out about the naked indecency of chief executive <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-disney-iger-pay-20190111-story.html\">Robert Iger&rsquo;s pay</a>. According to <a href=\"https://www.equilar.com/reports/63-table-highest-paid-ceos-2019-equilar-100.html\">Equilar</a>, Iger took home more than $65 million in 2018. That&rsquo;s 1,424 times the median pay of a Disney worker. To put that gap in context, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/22/heres-how-much-ceo-pay-has-increased-compared-to-yours-over-the-years.html\">in 1978</a>, the average CEO made about 30 times a typical worker&rsquo;s salary. Since 1978, CEO pay has grown by 937 percent, while the pay of an average worker grew just 11.2 percent.</p>\n<p>This growth in inequality has affected every corner of American life. We are increasingly a lopsided, barbell nation, where the middle class is shrinking, a very few, very affluent people own a great deal and the majority have relatively little. What is more, as their wealth has grown, the super-rich have invested heavily in politicians, policies and social messaging to pad their already grotesque advantages.</p>\n<p>In 2017, with the quiet encouragement of corporations across the country, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As billions of dollars landed in the laps of management, they spent as a rule not on their workforces but on wealth-enriching strategies such as <a href=\"https://americansfortaxfairness.org/key-facts-american-corporations-really-trump-tax-cuts/\">stock buybacks</a> and, yes, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/30/eye-popping-payouts-for-ceos-follow-trumps-tax-cuts-747649\">executive pay</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2018, Disney gave more than 125,000 employees <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/23/125000-disney-employees-to-receive-1000-cash-bonus-company-launches-new-50-million-education-program.html\">a $1,000 bonus</a>. But that $125 million or so was dwarfed by the <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/business/taxes/trumps-tax-cuts/last-year-some-bonuses-some-pay-raises-this-year-not-so-much/\">$3.6 billion</a> it spent to buy shares back to drive up its stock price and thus enrich its shareholders. Given that about 85 percent of stocks are held by the richest people in the country, this was a significant new investment in wealth inequality.</p>\n<p>I have been quietly grumbling about this issue for some time now, uncertain how public to be. It is time to call out the men and women who lead us and to draw a line in the sand about how low we are prepared to let hard-working people sink while top management takes home ever-more-outrageous sums of money. It is unreasonable to expect corporate boards to act as a check on this trend; they are almost universally made up of CEOs, former CEOs and people who long to be CEOs.</p>\n<p>Disney has pushed back by <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90333082/disney-ceo-bob-igers-compensation-is-insane-says-abigail-disney\">noting</a> that it pays more than the $7.25 federal minimum wage. This argument fails to acknowledge that the cost of living varies from place to place and few can make do on that, no matter where they live. It also fails to recognize that the company <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-anaheim-living-wage-20180619-story.html\">worked quietly to try to defeat</a> a ballot initiative to lift the minimum wage paid by certain employers to $15 an hour in Anaheim, Calif., which passed this past November.</p>\n<p>At a company that has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/walt-disney-posts-record-annual-profit-1541712257\">never been more profitable</a>, whose top executives drive home with seven- and eight-figure paychecks and whose primary resource is the good-spirited, public-facing people who greet guests day after day, why are we dancing around a minimum wage anyway? I&rsquo;m not arguing that Iger and others do not deserve bonuses. They do. They have led the company brilliantly. I am saying that the people who contribute to its success also deserve a share of the profits they have helped make happen.</p>\n<p>There are just over 200,000 employees at Disney. If management wants to improve life for just the bottom 10 percent of its workers, Disney could probably set aside just half of its executive bonus pool, and it would likely have twice as much as it would need to give that bottom decile a $2,000 bonus. Besides, at the pay levels we are talking about, an executive giving up half his bonus has zero effect on his quality of life. For the people at the bottom, it could mean a ticket out of poverty or debt. It could offer access to decent health care or an education for a child.</p>\n<p>Here is my suggestion to the Walt Disney Co. leadership. Lead. If any of this rings any moral bells for you, know that you are uniquely situated to model a different way of doing business. Reward all of your workers fairly. Don&rsquo;t turn away when they tell you they are unable to make ends meet. You do not exist merely for the benefit of shareholders and managers. Reward all the people who make you successful, help rebuild the American middle class and respect the dignity of the men and women who work just as hard as you do to make Disney the amazing company it is.</p>",

Notions of ethnosupremacy have always had their roots in transnational traditions of racism, and now online communities allow for actors in any nation to draw inspiration from those in another. The Christchurch <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/03/15/shootings-reported-mosques-christchurch-new-zealand/?utm_term=.f663b65a0894&tid=lk_inline_manual_1\">massacre</a> is a case in point: allegedly carried out by an Australian, in New Zealand, in the image of a Norwegian and an American.</p>\n<p>The shooting revealed serious shortcomings in how governments confront right-wing radicalism. In the United States, Islamist extremism, even when it is homegrown, is considered international terrorism &mdash; and law enforcement treats it that way. Right-wing radicalism, on the other hand, is called domestic terrorism if it is called terrorism at all. Sometimes, crimes motivated by the same set of values are instead classified as hate crimes or gang violence. Right-wing radicalism <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/magazine/FBI-charlottesville-white-nationalism-far-right.html\">kills more Americans</a> than Islamist extremism, and the government should pursue the threat with more vigor. Doing so will require grappling with its domestic and global dimensions alike.</p>\n<p>The first step to fighting white-supremacist extremism is to understand it, but that&rsquo;s not possible now, because the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/2018_10_DomesticTerrorism_V2%20%281%29.pdf\">does not reliably collect</a> the relevant information. Even hate-crime reporting is voluntary &mdash; and <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/its-time-congress-make-domestic-terrorism-federal-crime\">undercounted</a>. A requirement for annual reports on all prosecutions of domestic terrorism and hate crimes, with relevant details, would go a long way toward assessing the problem. From there, the government should reallocate resources, which today are devoted <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/jmd/file/822286/download\">disproportionately</a> to fighting Islamist terrorism even as right-wing attacks rise. President Trump pushed <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/trump-shut-countering-violent-extremism-program/574237/\">in the wrong direction</a> when he shut down an interagency task force on countering violent extremism and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-budget-extremism/white-house-budget-slashes-countering-violent-extremism-grants-idUSKBN18J2HJ\">ended</a> relevant grants.</p>\n<p>Just as tackling right-wing extremism domestically will require federal, state and local government agencies to coordinate, authorities confronting white supremacy&rsquo;s global reach will need global partners.

(European Southern Observatory / M. Kornmesser/ESO/M. Kornmesser)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The interstellar object known as &lsquo;Oumuamua plunged into our solar system in 2017, leaving a trail of mystery in its wake. It appeared as a tiny point of light, millions of times fainter than the earthbound human eye could see. Teams of astronomers from across the world deduced that &lsquo;Oumuamua was a reddish, somewhat cigar-shaped rock, spinning and tumbling in space on its path through our planetary system. As it swung past the sun, &lsquo;Oumuamua seemed to speed up ever so slightly &mdash; something often seen in comets, which emit jets of gas that give them a little extra kick as they get nearer to the sun. However, even the deepest images of our interstellar visitor failed to reveal any evidence of these jets, and so its acceleration confounded the astro-paparazzi.</p>\n<p>While &lsquo;Oumuamua itself is gone, its story has been on a decidedly different orbit. In a news cycle that otherwise offers a relentless torrent of trauma and political intrigue, &lsquo;Oumuamua appears and reappears, its faint glints reminding us that sometimes, we, too, crave a speedy escape from our immediate reality.

                "text": "The interstellar object known as \u2018Oumuamua plunged into our solar system in 2017, leaving a trail of mystery in its wake. It appeared as a tiny point of light, millions of times fainter than the earthbound human eye could see. Teams of astronomers from across the world deduced that \u2018Oumuamua was a reddish, somewhat cigar-shaped rock, spinning and tumbling in space on its path through our planetary system. As it swung past the sun, \u2018Oumuamua seemed to speed up ever so slightly \u2014 something often seen in comets, which emit jets of gas that give them a little extra kick as they get nearer to the sun. However, even the deepest images of our interstellar visitor failed to reveal any evidence of these jets, and so its acceleration confounded the astro-paparazzi.\nWhile \u2018Oumuamua itself is gone, its story has been on a decidedly different orbit. In a news cycle that otherwise offers a relentless torrent of trauma and political intrigue, \u2018Oumuamua appears and reappears, its faint glints reminding us that sometimes, we, too, crave a speedy escape from our immediate reality. 'Oumuamua fascinates us of because the questions it left behind: The void of what we don\u2019t know gives us room to stretch our minds and wonder. While scientific knowledge is typically built from the grit of unglamorous measurements, it\u2019s often the wilder possibilities that gain the most attention. Some would say that arguing for those seemingly out-there ideas is nothing more than exploring the full space of interpretation \u2014 but power dynamics limit who gets to voice that freedom of mental movement.\nMuch of the ongoing coverage has centered on the claim that \u2018Oumuamua might be a defunct alien spacecraft, which has turned the spotlight onto one of the authors of that claim, Avi Loeb. Loeb is known for his idea papers \u2014 slim briefs that often straddle the space between essay and scientific journal article \u2014 that other astronomers typically greet with wry acceptance, recognizing that they are written to encourage the free expression of ideas, even ideas that arrive, like \u2018Oumuamua itself, on hyperbolic trajectories.\nWithin the scientific community, outlandish ideas like Loeb\u2019s can be divisive, primarily because claims that attract a lot of media attention can turn the conversation away from the definite facts we\u2019ve worked hard to learn. Scientists who make big claims can be seen as capitalizing on media hype, and the rest of us sometimes blame the media itself for playing a part. If we\u2019re being honest, though, we have to admit that everyone involved \u2014 not just journalists, but also academic and research institutions and even the scientists themselves \u2014 participates in the hype cycle.\nHype in science can be seen as an outgrowth of the larger crisis in journalism, as the precipitous decline in journalism jobs has meant that few news outlets employ dedicated science journalists. While many scientists blame hyped-up science news on a lack of journalistic expertise, the reality is more complex: As the bottom fell out for science journalism jobs, many science journalists were faced with the choice between battling it out as freelancers or using their skills to work in the communications offices of the institutions housing scientists \u2014 usually universities. There, they would be tasked with spreading the word about the results of new research happening at their home institutions.\nWhile the writers themselves are genuinely excited to share these new discoveries, media attention boosts the institution itself, enhancing its reputation and opening up new funding avenues. Accordingly, no news release, however measured, is ever solely about the distribution of new knowledge. And yet these same documents still do help journalists (especially those without specialized training in science) identify what new scientific results might be transformative.\nIt\u2019s here that the problem of hyperbole comes into play. Many astronomers are fond of what\u2019s known as the Sagan standard: the saying that \u201cextraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\u201d By contrast, ancient rhetoricians such as Quintilian believed that extraordinary circumstances actually justify hyperbole, because it can express the inexpressible when, in Quintilian\u2019s phrase, \u201cno one is contented with the exact truth.\u201d All hyperbole skates a thin boundary between elegance and extravagance, between capturing the incompleteness of our knowledge, and distorting the truth. Among scientists \u2014 and, in this case, astronomers specifically \u2014 the boundaries of how outlandish one can be are limited by our commitment to careful measurement and moderate interpretations. Hyperbolic ideas therefore need not leave the solar system entirely before they risk offending our sensibilities.\nBut does hyperbole actually shift our perspective on the possible at all? Over at the Atlantic, Marina Koren has written about how institutional prestige \u2014 in this case, Loeb\u2019s position as chairman of the Harvard Astronomy Department, along with his long list of other accomplishments \u2014 can add a certain gravitas to a claim that might be dismissed if it came from somewhere else. But it also shapes who can get away with extreme ideas in the first place. Pushing the boundaries of plausibility comes with risk to one\u2019s career and reputation, so while anyone can use hyperbole as a tool, the risk that one bears is substantially higher if you are not insulated by a name-brand institution, along with titles and accomplishments from adjacent name-brand institutions.

His team then allegedly either destroyed or altered those ballots before dropping them off to be counted &mdash; violating the law in a variety of ways.</p>\n<p>We often hear, including from President Trump, about allegations of rampant fraud involving people going to polling places and pretending to be someone else.

That&rsquo;s in-person voter fraud, which has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/03/heres-how-rare-in-person-voter-fraud-is/?tid=lk_inline_manual_4\">never been found</a> to have happened to any significant degree in recent years. What happened in North Carolina involved absentee ballots and has often been described as <i>election</i> fraud since it wasn&rsquo;t the voters themselves who are alleged to have broken the law.</p>\n<p>None of this, though, is how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell described it in a speech from the Senate floor Tuesday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Anyone who&rsquo;s been attentive to the news these past few days has learned about the complete debacle that unfolded in last November&rsquo;s election for North Carolina&rsquo;s 9th Congressional District,&rdquo; McConnell (R-Ky.) said. &ldquo;Soon after Election Day, allegations of illegal ballot harvesting and vote tampering clouded a close result.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The wrongdoing seemed to have benefited the Republican candidate over the Democrat,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Just last week we saw the state Board of Elections unanimously call for a new election.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>McConnell is not one to misspeak, particularly when reading from prepared remarks. His &ldquo;seemed to have benefited&rdquo; here is intentional, an effort not to withhold judgment but to cast doubt.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence at all that the Democratic candidate in the race, Dan McCready, benefited from any illegal activity. There&rsquo;s no evidence that any illegal absentee ballot collection or alteration was conducted by anyone beside Dowless and his employees. And Dowless wasn&rsquo;t just a volunteer, randomly picking his targets: He was being paid by the Harris campaign. The way his efforts came to light was that results in one county, Bladen County, seemed <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/30/why-allegations-voter-fraud-north-carolina-are-being-treated-seriously/?tid=lk_inline_manual_14\">way out of whack</a> from other counties &mdash; to Harris&rsquo;s benefit.</p>\n<p>Here, at this moment, the point of McConnell&rsquo;s speech is clear. After his party was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/21/federal-election-will-be-rerun-because-fraud-republicans-arent-talking-about-it-much/?tid=lk_inline_manual_15\">broadly silent</a> about what happened in North Carolina despite its energetic stance on voter fraud for years, McConnell decided to flip the script.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Now Madame President,&rdquo; he continued, speaking to the senator overseeing the morning&rsquo;s proceedings, &ldquo;for years and years, every Republican who dared to call for common-sense safeguards for Americans&rsquo; ballots was demonized by Democrats and their allies. We were hit with left-wing talking points insisting that voter fraud wasn&rsquo;t real. Never happens, they said. That fraud just didn&rsquo;t happen. That modest efforts to ensure that voters are who they say they are and are voting in a proper place were really some sinister right-wing plot to prevent people from voting.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This is simply dishonest. McConnell is intentionally conflating in-person, change-your-hat fraud with what happened in North Carolina, which wasn&rsquo;t that.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s as though McConnell and his party had been complaining for years about burglars using crowbars to break into houses and then claiming validation when someone created a master key to unlock every front door on a block. The result is the same: The house has been violated. But the thing that the Republicans were warning about isn&rsquo;t the thing that actually happened.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also like burglars only broke into houses with crowbars a couple of times a year but to keep that from happening Republicans wanted anyone buying a tool to bring a birth certificate with them to Home Depot. And, just to strain this metaphor to the breaking point, that people who buy crowbars for legitimate purposes are mostly Democrats.</p>\n<p>After all, the Republican solution to in-person voter fraud &mdash; which, again, isn&rsquo;t what happened in North Carolina and, again, which happens only rarely &mdash; is to mandate that voters bring ID with them to the polling place. If people don&rsquo;t have ID, they need to get one, often involving fees, visits to government offices and digging up missing documentation. It&rsquo;s an encumbrance that falls more heavily on poorer Americans, who often overlap with groups that tend to vote Democratic.</p>\n<p>A Government Accountability Office study completed in 2014 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/10/09/gao-voter-id-laws-in-kansas-and-tennessee-dropped-2012-turnout-by-over-100000-votes/?utm_term=.e9b3d3eef197&tid=lk_inline_manual_25\">found</a> that voter ID laws in Kansas and Tennessee probably dropped 2012 turnout in those states by 100,000 people.

Comey as FBI director in May 2017.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Conway shared <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/george-conway-s-letter-to-trump/?noteId=9b4cf1bb-1a6c-48ab-b5db-decaf8c76a8b&questionId=1a36c94f-ae2e-414e-899c-638b68f07b6a&utm_term=.44144753cb33&tid=lk_inline_manual_18\">a letter he wrote to Trump</a>, dated May 31, 2017, in which he thanked Trump for selecting him for the job but said he was backing out.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have reluctantly concluded, however, that for me and my family, this is not the right time for me to leave the private sector and take on a new role in the federal government,&rdquo; Conway wrote. &ldquo;Kellyanne and I continue to support you and your Administration, and I look forward to doing so in whatever way I can from outside government.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It was unclear what Trump meant by his assertion in his tweet that Kellyanne Conway had a role in denying her husband a job.</p>\n<p>Conway said in Tuesday&rsquo;s interview that he has had a number of notable interactions with Trump over the past decade, often concerning legal representation and sensitive legal matters since Trump became president.</p>\n<p>Wednesday was the second consecutive day that Trump has used Twitter to attack George Conway. In a much shorter tweet Tuesday, he called him a &ldquo;loser.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>George Conway has been a persistent critic of Trump&rsquo;s policies and actions, frequently going on Twitter to question whether the president is operating within the Constitution and other accepted boundaries. But the criticism recently has become more personal, and he has often attacked Trump just after his wife has defended the president on television.</p>\n<p>In tweets Monday, Conway included images from the American Psychiatric Association&rsquo;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, including pages with diagnostic criteria for &ldquo;narcissistic personality disorder&rdquo; and &ldquo;antisocial personality disorder.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In Tuesday&rsquo;s interview, Conway said his tweets questioning the president&rsquo;s mental health were aimed in part at avoiding conflicts with his wife.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so maddening to watch,&rdquo; Conway said. &ldquo;The mendacity, the incompetence, it&rsquo;s just maddening to watch. The tweeting is just the way to get it out of the way, so I can get it off my chest and move on with my life that day. That&rsquo;s basically it. Frankly, it&rsquo;s so I don&rsquo;t end up screaming at her about it.&rdquo;</p>",

(Michael Dwyer/AP)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Former vice president Joe Biden is planning to enter the 2020 presidential race on Thursday, nearly finalizing the crowded field of Democrats with a candidacy that will test many of the questions coursing through the party.</p>\n<p>Biden is expected to make the announcement in a video, according to a source close to him, which will be followed by a trip Monday to a union hall in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>One of the first events for the campaign will be a high-dollar fundraiser Thursday night, sponsored by a group of supporters including Comcast senior executive vice president David L. Cohen. Biden over the next week or so is expected to travel to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.</p>\n<p>Biden will enter the race in an unfamiliar position, generally at the top of polls nationally and in early states, following campaigns in 1988 and 2008 that ended in failure. His challenge this time will be to wrestle control of a party that has been energized by many demographics to which Biden does not belong &mdash; liberals, millennials, women and minorities.</p>\n<p>But it is also a party that is consumed, above all else, with trying to defeat President Trump, and Biden is planning to make the case that he is best positioned to win back key blue-collar swing voters in states that Trump carried in 2016.</p>\n<p>His advisers and supporters have watched with dismay as the Democratic primary discussion has been dominated by liberal positions on questions such as whether to launch impeachment hearings and, separately, debates over reparations. They said Biden is planning to introduce a message that is far more centrist and focused on the economy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to be pragmatic about this as a party, there&rsquo;s only one person who can beat Donald Trump and can go toe-to-toe with him in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin and take it to him on his own terms. And that&rsquo;s Joe Biden,&rdquo; said Dick Harpootlian, a Democratic state senator from South Carolina and a longtime Biden supporter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This should not be a primary election about whether or not you&rsquo;re for Medicare-for-all or the green plan. or whatever it is,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about who can stop the pain. Who can beat this guy in November?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Biden&rsquo;s allies believe that his long tenure in public life &mdash; one that dates to 1973, when he entered the U.S. Senate as a 30-year-old representing Delaware &mdash; has endeared him to voters.</p>\n<p>But in a field suffused with new faces and a broad spread of experience, he is either the elder statesman or the old-school politician past his prime. His references tend to skew older, with quotations from Adlai Stevenson and decades-old war stories about the Senate. The 76-year-old has been in elected office longer than some of his rivals have been alive.</p>\n<p>He is likely to lay claim to the Obama legacy, touting his eight-year partnership with the nation&rsquo;s first black president, in a way few others can fully claim. And that in turn may prompt newly public discussion about whether the Obama administration&rsquo;s policies suffice in a party that has rapidly moved to the left in recent years.</p>\n<p>Obama has been largely absent from the Democratic debate. Some candidates have subtly &mdash; or not, in the case of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who shares Biden&rsquo;s strength in early polls &mdash; distanced themselves from a more centrist, corporatist approach to politics that attempts to unify red and blue states.</p>\n<p>Although Obama is not planning to make an endorsement, he has talked about trying to encourage the next generation of political leadership, one pointedly younger than his vice president. Nonetheless, Biden is likely to embrace their connection and project that he would return the country to a more conventional era. One example: In speeches made in recent months, he has talked up his ability to work with Republicans, which has triggered some criticism from those in the party who embrace a more confrontational style.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We seem to be at each other&rsquo;s throats. Extremism is on the rise in this country,&rdquo; Biden said in a recent speech to the International Association of Fire Fighters. &ldquo;Mean pettiness has overtaken our politics. Sometimes it seems like we can&rsquo;t govern ourselves or even talk to one another. . . . Folks, it&rsquo;s not who we are.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There are few modern-day analogies for Biden, who has been considered a top-tier presidential candidate over a span of more than four decades.</p>\n<p>In September 1987, facing allegations that included plagiarizing a speech from a British politician, he dropped out of the 1988 election contest less than four months after he entered it. Twenty years later, he lasted only until the first contest, the Iowa caucuses, before dropping out following a 1 percent finish.</p>\n<p>New Hampshire state House Speaker Steve Shurtleff (D) worked on that campaign and has been in touch with the Biden team. But he remains undecided.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have a lot of respect for him both as an elected official and as an individual. He&rsquo;ll add a lot to the dynamic, but for myself, I&rsquo;m going to keep my options open,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like every New Hampshire voter. You&rsquo;ve got to see each candidate three times before deciding. We&rsquo;ve got a long way to go.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Some of Biden&rsquo;s advisers say there has been little introspection by his team over the causes of his past two losses. Biden and his team believe the 2020 race is much different than the earlier contests and that Biden, as a former vice president who had had years to build ties with influential party members, is in a much stronger position.</p>\n<p>Biden considered running in 2016 but decided against it because he was still mourning the death of his son Beau. Later, he said he regretted not getting into the race.</p>\n<p>His decision to run this time concludes a months-long process in which announcement deadlines have come and gone with no decision.

                "text": "Former vice president Joe Biden is planning to enter the 2020 presidential race on Thursday, nearly finalizing the crowded field of Democrats with a candidacy that will test many of the questions coursing through the party.\nBiden is expected to make the announcement in a video, according to a source close to him, which will be followed by a trip Monday to a union hall in Pittsburgh.\nOne of the first events for the campaign will be a high-dollar fundraiser Thursday night, sponsored by a group of supporters including Comcast senior executive vice president David L. Cohen. Biden over the next week or so is expected to travel to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\nBiden will enter the race in an unfamiliar position, generally at the top of polls nationally and in early states, following campaigns in 1988 and 2008 that ended in failure. His challenge this time will be to wrestle control of a party that has been energized by many demographics to which Biden does not belong \u2014 liberals, millennials, women and minorities.\nBut it is also a party that is consumed, above all else, with trying to defeat President Trump, and Biden is planning to make the case that he is best positioned to win back key blue-collar swing voters in states that Trump carried in 2016.\nHis advisers and supporters have watched with dismay as the Democratic primary discussion has been dominated by liberal positions on questions such as whether to launch impeachment hearings and, separately, debates over reparations. They said Biden is planning to introduce a message that is far more centrist and focused on the economy.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to be pragmatic about this as a party, there\u2019s only one person who can beat Donald Trump and can go toe-to-toe with him in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin and take it to him on his own terms. And that\u2019s Joe Biden,\u201d said Dick Harpootlian, a Democratic state senator from South Carolina and a longtime Biden supporter.\n\u201cThis should not be a primary election about whether or not you\u2019re for Medicare-for-all or the green plan. or whatever it is,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s about who can stop the pain. Who can beat this guy in November?\u201d\nBiden\u2019s allies believe that his long tenure in public life \u2014 one that dates to 1973, when he entered the U.S. Senate as a 30-year-old representing Delaware \u2014 has endeared him to voters.\nBut in a field suffused with new faces and a broad spread of experience, he is either the elder statesman or the old-school politician past his prime. His references tend to skew older, with quotations from Adlai Stevenson and decades-old war stories about the Senate. The 76-year-old has been in elected office longer than some of his rivals have been alive.\nHe is likely to lay claim to the Obama legacy, touting his eight-year partnership with the nation\u2019s first black president, in a way few others can fully claim. And that in turn may prompt newly public discussion about whether the Obama administration\u2019s policies suffice in a party that has rapidly moved to the left in recent years.\nObama has been largely absent from the Democratic debate. Some candidates have subtly \u2014 or not, in the case of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who shares Biden\u2019s strength in early polls \u2014 distanced themselves from a more centrist, corporatist approach to politics that attempts to unify red and blue states.\nAlthough Obama is not planning to make an endorsement, he has talked about trying to encourage the next generation of political leadership, one pointedly younger than his vice president. Nonetheless, Biden is likely to embrace their connection and project that he would return the country to a more conventional era. One example: In speeches made in recent months, he has talked up his ability to work with Republicans, which has triggered some criticism from those in the party who embrace a more confrontational style.\n\u201cWe seem to be at each other\u2019s throats. Extremism is on the rise in this country,\u201d Biden said in a recent speech to the International Association of Fire Fighters. \u201cMean pettiness has overtaken our politics. Sometimes it seems like we can\u2019t govern ourselves or even talk to one another. . . . Folks, it\u2019s not who we are.\u201d\nThere are few modern-day analogies for Biden, who has been considered a top-tier presidential candidate over a span of more than four decades.\nIn September 1987, facing allegations that included plagiarizing a speech from a British politician, he dropped out of the 1988 election contest less than four months after he entered it. Twenty years later, he lasted only until the first contest, the Iowa caucuses, before dropping out following a 1 percent finish.\nNew Hampshire state House Speaker Steve Shurtleff (D) worked on that campaign and has been in touch with the Biden team. But he remains undecided.\n\u201cI have a lot of respect for him both as an elected official and as an individual. He\u2019ll add a lot to the dynamic, but for myself, I\u2019m going to keep my options open,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like every New Hampshire voter. You\u2019ve got to see each candidate three times before deciding. We\u2019ve got a long way to go.\u201d\nSome of Biden\u2019s advisers say there has been little introspection by his team over the causes of his past two losses. Biden and his team believe the 2020 race is much different than the earlier contests and that Biden, as a former vice president who had had years to build ties with influential party members, is in a much stronger position.\nBiden considered running in 2016 but decided against it because he was still mourning the death of his son Beau. Later, he said he regretted not getting into the race.\nHis decision to run this time concludes a months-long process in which announcement deadlines have come and gone with no decision. Biden said earlier this month that his goal has been to be the last candidate in the race. (A few other lesser-known would-be candidates have said they are still contemplating a campaign.)\nFor months, his advisers have kept a list of potential staffers they want to hire, updating the list as some have been nabbed by other campaigns. They believe there is still plenty of talent left to supplement a core group of veterans, some of whom have been with Biden for decades.\nAmerican Possibilities, a political action committee Biden has used to raise money and support other candidates, sent out an email to supporters on Tuesday urging them to prepare for an announcement.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll cut to the chase,\u201d the message said, providing a link for supporters to sign up. \u201cThere has been a lot of chatter about what Joe Biden plans to do. As one of Joe\u2019s top supporters, we want you to be the first to know!\u201d\nBiden\u2019s announcement will come hours before the Philadelphia fundraiser. Comcast executive Cohen, along with former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell and former Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter, has been drumming up support for about a week. One level of tickets costs $2,800, the maximum primary campaign donation. There is also a second tier for young professionals, at $250, according to a person familiar with the event.\nCohen is also chairman of the board of trustees at the University of Pennsylvania, where Biden has worked since early 2017 as a professor and then leader of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.\nWith his late entry into the race, Biden faces a major challenge to match some of his rivals who have tapped into small-dollar online networks. Biden, never a prolific fundraiser, has not been alone on a ballot since 2008, and the extent of his fundraising prowess is unknown even to his team.\nAs he begins his campaign, Biden will face scrutiny for a wide range of positions that, in some cases, were in line with Democratic orthodoxy long ago but are now out of step. Those include support for antibusing legislation in the 1970s, his role handling the Anita Hill hearings during Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s nomination process, and his arm-twisting on behalf of a crime bill in the 1990s. He has attempted to address some of those issues in recent weeks but has often stumbled.\n\u201cTo this day, I regret I couldn\u2019t come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved,\u201d Biden said last month of the hearings on Thomas\u2019s nomination, which he oversaw as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nHe has also come under criticism in recent weeks for his hands-on style. Several women have said made he them feel uncomfortable with hugs, pressing his forehead against theirs, or, in one case, smelling a Nevada politician\u2019s hair.\nBiden posted a video saying that \u201csocial norms are changing\u201d and that he would be \u201cmuch more mindful.\u201d Two days later, however, he twice joked about the complaints during a speech to union workers.",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) could see the shape of the attack ads that could be used against him.</p>\n<p>A questioner at a CNN town hall Monday night asked the presidential candidate whether he believes that incarcerated felons &mdash; the Boston Marathon bomber, for instance, or sex offenders &mdash; should be allowed to vote while they are serving their sentences.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy &mdash; yes, even for terrible people &mdash; because once you start chipping away &hellip; you&rsquo;re running down a slippery slope,&rdquo; Sanders said. &ldquo;I do believe that even if they are in jail paying their price to society, that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In a presidential campaign in which the Democratic candidates broadly embrace systemic changes to criminal justice &mdash; and as many Republicans also support such policies &mdash; Sanders&rsquo;s comments nonetheless stand out.</p>\n<p>Support has been growing nationally for re-enfranchising felons after they are released, and several states have taken steps in that direction.

That he gets his absentee ballot.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sanders&rsquo;s comments, and the reaction to them, reflect Democratic candidates&rsquo; tricky path ahead. They&rsquo;re striving to ignite support among a liberal, unusually energized Democratic primary electorate &mdash; while knowing that in a general election they&rsquo;ll face a far more conservative voting population, prodded by a GOP eager to paint Democrats as extreme.</p>\n<p>The two venues aren&rsquo;t entirely separate, since polls suggest many Democratic primary voters care deeply about choosing a nominee who can win the general election.

In November, Florida voted to become the latest state to allow felons who have served their time to vote, part of a growing support for re-enfranchisement. The measure, which excluded those convicted of murder or sexual offenses, needed 60 percent of the vote to pass and received 65 percent.</p>\n<p>Still, many people &mdash; including presidential candidates &mdash; seem uncomfortable with the notion of allowing felons to vote before they have completed their sentences.</p>\n<p>Those behind Florida&rsquo;s initiative said they crafted it carefully to attract enough support.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We spent years working with folks all over the state on our amendment language,&rdquo; said Neil Volz, political director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition. &ldquo;It was a reflection of what was supported by the people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Maine and Sanders&rsquo;s home state of Vermont are the only two states that allow inmates to vote while they&rsquo;re incarcerated.</p>\n<p>Proponents of keeping felons away from the ballot box say the convicted forfeit their right to participate fully in American society &mdash; including elections &mdash; when they choose to break the law. Disenfranchisement laws affect nearly 6 million Americans, although states vary in whether and how they restore voting rights, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/issues/voting-rights/voter-restoration/felony-disenfranchisement-laws-map\">according to the American Civil Liberties Union</a>.</p>\n<p>Most of the Democratic aspirants for the White House, while saying disenfranchisement laws need to change, have remained silent on whether people in prison should be allowed to cast ballots.</p>\n<p>South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who also appeared on a CNN town hall Monday night, said he believes states should re-enfranchise felons, but only after they&rsquo;re released from prison.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Part of the punishment when you are convicted of a crime and you&rsquo;re incarcerated is you lose certain rights; you lose your freedom,&rdquo; Buttigieg said. &ldquo;And I think during that period, it does not make sense to have an exception for the right to vote.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In her own CNN appearance, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) said she felt strongly about re-enfranchising released felons, and was willing to &ldquo;have a conversation&rdquo; about people casting ballots from prison, a sentiment similar to that expressed by another Democratic candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), at a March forum in Storm Lake, Iowa.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Right now, I think the fight should be over felony re-enfranchisement,&rdquo; Warren said. &ldquo;While they&rsquo;re still incarcerated, I think that&rsquo;s a different question, and I think that&rsquo;s something we can have more conversation about.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>One of the Democratic candidates, Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), has made voting rights especially central to his campaign. He spent several days last week in Georgia talking about voting issues, including his support for ending partisan gerrymandering, implementing universal voter registration and allowing convicted felons to vote. But he has not said anything publicly about voting by felons still inside America&rsquo;s prisons.</p>\n<p>While Sanders&rsquo;s position set him apart from the other presidential hopefuls, Republicans quickly seized on it to tar all the Democrats seeking the White House.</p>\n<p>Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee, tweeted that &ldquo;letting terrorists vote&rdquo; was part of the candidates&rsquo; &ldquo;dangerous agenda.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you had any doubt about how radical the Democrat Party has become, their 2020 front-runner wants to let terrorists convicted of murdering American citizens vote from prison,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond extreme.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted that Sanders &ldquo;supports allowing rapists, murderers, and terrorists &mdash; like the Boston bomber and [Dylann] Roof, the individual who massacred 9 church-goers in Charleston, to vote from prison.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sanders&rsquo;s position, however, could resonate with some in the African American community. Incarcerated terrorists represent an extreme minority of felons, said Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King, a Sanders supporter.</p>\n<p>King said in an interview that he supports voting rights for people in prison because it would counteract a racist approach dating to the Jim Crow era that still disproportionately affects minorities.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;People like to use the worst possible examples &mdash; &lsquo;Oh, you want Dylann Roof to vote?&rsquo; &rdquo; King said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad-faith argument. Are we saying that all of those (incarcerated) people don&rsquo;t deserve the right to vote because of your problems with Dylann Roof?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He added, &ldquo;These policies, the roots of these policies, is about stripping people of their political powers. Many states in the 1880s, the 1890s, were taking way the vote of people they were afraid of &mdash; namely, black people.&rdquo;</p>",

But he has not said anything publicly about voting by felons still inside America\u2019s prisons.\nWhile Sanders\u2019s position set him apart from the other presidential hopefuls, Republicans quickly seized on it to tar all the Democrats seeking the White House.\nRonna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee, tweeted that \u201cletting terrorists vote\u201d was part of the candidates\u2019 \u201cdangerous agenda.\u201d\n\u201cIf you had any doubt about how radical the Democrat Party has become, their 2020 front-runner wants to let terrorists convicted of murdering American citizens vote from prison,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond extreme.\u201d\nAnd Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted that Sanders \u201csupports allowing rapists, murderers, and terrorists \u2014 like the Boston bomber and [Dylann] Roof, the individual who massacred 9 church-goers in Charleston, to vote from prison.\u201d\nSanders\u2019s position, however, could resonate with some in the African American community. Incarcerated terrorists represent an extreme minority of felons, said Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King, a Sanders supporter.\nKing said in an interview that he supports voting rights for people in prison because it would counteract a racist approach dating to the Jim Crow era that still disproportionately affects minorities.\n\u201cPeople like to use the worst possible examples \u2014 \u2018Oh, you want Dylann Roof to vote?\u2019 \u201d King said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad-faith argument. Are we saying that all of those (incarcerated) people don\u2019t deserve the right to vote because of your problems with Dylann Roof?\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThese policies, the roots of these policies, is about stripping people of their political powers. Many states in the 1880s, the 1890s, were taking way the vote of people they were afraid of \u2014 namely, black people.\u201d",

                "html": "<p>The formal state visit to Britain promised to President Trump more than two years ago will finally happen in early June, although the main reasons for the delay &mdash; turmoil over Brexit and overwhelming opposition to Trump among Londoners &mdash; remain unchanged.</p>\n<p>Buckingham Palace and the White House announced Tuesday that Trump and first lady Melania Trump will visit Britain for three days in early June. State visits typically include a banquet with the queen and a formal procession in London, complete with horse-drawn carriage.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This state visit will reaffirm the steadfast and special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom,&rdquo; a statement from the White House said.</p>\n<p>Striking a similar note, British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement that the visit would be &ldquo;an opportunity to strengthen our already close relationship in areas such as trade, investment, security and defense, and to discuss how we can build on these ties in the years ahead.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The invitation is an all-the-trappings diplomatic plum. Queen Elizabeth II, on the throne since 1952, has hosted only two other U.S. presidents for these ceremonial visits &mdash; George W. Bush and Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>This trip follows what was billed as a &ldquo;working visit&rdquo; to Britain last July that featured a giant balloon depicting Trump as a screaming baby in a diaper hovering above tens of thousands of protesters in London.</p>\n<p>The planned visit comes amid strained relations between Trump and May. On the eve of last year&rsquo;s visit, Trump was quoted in a British tabloid criticizing her approach to Brexit and threatening to upend the U.S.-British trade relationship. Trump and his associates continued to root for Brexit this year while suggesting that May had botched it. May&rsquo;s own political position is perilous, and while the White House statement said Trump would meet with her during his visit, it is not clear whether she will still be prime minister then.</p>\n<p>May first pledged the invitation shortly after Trump&rsquo;s inauguration in January 2017. Her offer was criticized at home, as was a photo appearing to show her and Trump holding hands when she visited him as the first foreign leader to pay respects to the new president.</p>\n<p>The state visit has been repeatedly put on hold because of the prolonged British divorce from the European Union that has preoccupied May, and by concern among advisers to both leaders about the chilly reception Trump would receive.</p>\n<p>Disapproval of Trump among Britons has remained above 70 percent in most polling since he emerged as a leading Republican candidate in 2016, although some of the fiercest Brexit proponents see him as an ally.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think there will be protests,&rdquo; London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC on Tuesday. &ldquo;I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t take a crystal ball for people to predict there will be protests. Many of the things that this president has said, people find objectionable,&rdquo; he said, pointing, in particular, to Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;amplification&rdquo; of racist views and his singling out of Muslims.</p>\n<p>Trump was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/britain-furious-trump-defiant-as-fallout-swells-from-anti-muslim-videos/2017/11/30/d9ae0f2c-d5d7-11e7-b62d-d9345ced896d_story.html?utm_term=.d3074f9b5efd&tid=lk_inline_manual_19\">criticized across Britain</a>, and by May in a rare public rebuke of the leader of Britain&rsquo;s closest ally, when he shared inflammatory anti-Muslim videos on Twitter posted by a far-right British activist in November 2017.</p>\n<p>Emily Thornberry, foreign affairs spokeswoman for Britain&rsquo;s main opposition Labour Party, criticized the planned visit.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is a president who has systematically assaulted all the shared values that unite our two countries, and unless Theresa May is finally going to stand up to him and object to that behavior, she has no business wasting taxpayers&rsquo; money on all the pomp, ceremony and policing costs that will come with this visit,&rdquo; Thornberry said.</p>\n<p>Dave Webb, chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, a British-based group, called the invitation shocking.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why is Theresa May attempting to normalize the behavior of a man who casually threatens nuclear war, who tears up nuclear treaties, who has broken every convention of appropriate behavior with his misogynistic language, his ban on Muslim immigrants, his climate change denial and retweeting material from far-right organizations here in Britain?&rdquo; Webb said in a statement to The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>With help from May and the queen, Trump was able to avoid direct interaction with most of the London protests last year. He held an official meeting with May at the prime minister&rsquo;s country retreat, Chequers, and visited the queen at Windsor Castle, about 25 miles from central London. He also visited his golf club in Scotland.</p>\n<p>During discussions about the upcoming trip, British officials informed administration officials that Trump would not be able to stay at Buckingham Palace &mdash; as is often the custom for state visits &mdash; because it is still undergoing renovations and only a few rooms were available. The administration replied that this was no problem; they could make just a few rooms work. But the British ultimately explained that they did not feel that they could give the president the proper treatment with the palace being renovated.</p>\n<p>The British government is working on new lodging arrangements for Trump and his team, though the most likely option is the Winfield House.</p>\n<p>A senior British source said that Trump&rsquo;s not staying in Buckingham Palace is not a snub but simply an issue of logistics.</p>\n<p>If Trump keeps to the traditions of a state visit, he will not be able to avoid encountering London demonstrators. The Trumps also plan to attend a June 5 ceremony in Portsmouth, far from London, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day.</p>\n<p>Portsmouth was one of the primary embarkation sites for the Allied operation that helped defeat Nazi Germany and liberate Europe during World War II.</p>\n<p>According to May&rsquo;s office, countries that fought alongside Britain in the military operation, as well as Germany, have been invited to attend. The gathering will include live performances, military displays and tributes to the Allied troops who fought in Normandy in World War II.</p>\n<p>Portsmouth City Council leader Gerald Vernon-Jackson told the BBC that Trump&rsquo;s attendance will &ldquo;take away&rdquo; from the event and that presidential-level security could make it harder for veterans to attend.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Inevitably, if Donald Trump is in town, there will be controversy, there will be protests,&rdquo; Vernon-Jackson said. &ldquo;It would have been an open-access event on the common. Now it will all be behind steel barriers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump will be in France the following day, where he will meet with President Emmanuel Macron and travel to Normandy to observe the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings at the Normandy American Cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer.</p>",

                "text": "The formal state visit to Britain promised to President Trump more than two years ago will finally happen in early June, although the main reasons for the delay \u2014 turmoil over Brexit and overwhelming opposition to Trump among Londoners \u2014 remain unchanged.\nBuckingham Palace and the White House announced Tuesday that Trump and first lady Melania Trump will visit Britain for three days in early June. State visits typically include a banquet with the queen and a formal procession in London, complete with horse-drawn carriage.\n\u201cThis state visit will reaffirm the steadfast and special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom,\u201d a statement from the White House said.\nStriking a similar note, British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement that the visit would be \u201can opportunity to strengthen our already close relationship in areas such as trade, investment, security and defense, and to discuss how we can build on these ties in the years ahead.\u201d\nThe invitation is an all-the-trappings diplomatic plum. Queen Elizabeth II, on the throne since 1952, has hosted only two other U.S. presidents for these ceremonial visits \u2014 George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\nThis trip follows what was billed as a \u201cworking visit\u201d to Britain last July that featured a giant balloon depicting Trump as a screaming baby in a diaper hovering above tens of thousands of protesters in London.\nThe planned visit comes amid strained relations between Trump and May. On the eve of last year\u2019s visit, Trump was quoted in a British tabloid criticizing her approach to Brexit and threatening to upend the U.S.-British trade relationship. Trump and his associates continued to root for Brexit this year while suggesting that May had botched it. May\u2019s own political position is perilous, and while the White House statement said Trump would meet with her during his visit, it is not clear whether she will still be prime minister then.\nMay first pledged the invitation shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017. Her offer was criticized at home, as was a photo appearing to show her and Trump holding hands when she visited him as the first foreign leader to pay respects to the new president.\nThe state visit has been repeatedly put on hold because of the prolonged British divorce from the European Union that has preoccupied May, and by concern among advisers to both leaders about the chilly reception Trump would receive.\nDisapproval of Trump among Britons has remained above 70 percent in most polling since he emerged as a leading Republican candidate in 2016, although some of the fiercest Brexit proponents see him as an ally.\n\u201cI think there will be protests,\u201d London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC on Tuesday. \u201cI mean, it doesn\u2019t take a crystal ball for people to predict there will be protests. Many of the things that this president has said, people find objectionable,\u201d he said, pointing, in particular, to Trump\u2019s \u201camplification\u201d of racist views and his singling out of Muslims.\nTrump was criticized across Britain, and by May in a rare public rebuke of the leader of Britain\u2019s closest ally, when he shared inflammatory anti-Muslim videos on Twitter posted by a far-right British activist in November 2017.\nEmily Thornberry, foreign affairs spokeswoman for Britain\u2019s main opposition Labour Party, criticized the planned visit.\n\u201cThis is a president who has systematically assaulted all the shared values that unite our two countries, and unless Theresa May is finally going to stand up to him and object to that behavior, she has no business wasting taxpayers\u2019 money on all the pomp, ceremony and policing costs that will come with this visit,\u201d Thornberry said.\nDave Webb, chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, a British-based group, called the invitation shocking.\n\u201cWhy is Theresa May attempting to normalize the behavior of a man who casually threatens nuclear war, who tears up nuclear treaties, who has broken every convention of appropriate behavior with his misogynistic language, his ban on Muslim immigrants, his climate change denial and retweeting material from far-right organizations here in Britain?\u201d Webb said in a statement to The Washington Post.\nWith help from May and the queen, Trump was able to avoid direct interaction with most of the London protests last year. He held an official meeting with May at the prime minister\u2019s country retreat, Chequers, and visited the queen at Windsor Castle, about 25 miles from central London. He also visited his golf club in Scotland.\nDuring discussions about the upcoming trip, British officials informed administration officials that Trump would not be able to stay at Buckingham Palace \u2014 as is often the custom for state visits \u2014 because it is still undergoing renovations and only a few rooms were available. The administration replied that this was no problem; they could make just a few rooms work. But the British ultimately explained that they did not feel that they could give the president the proper treatment with the palace being renovated.\nThe British government is working on new lodging arrangements for Trump and his team, though the most likely option is the Winfield House.\nA senior British source said that Trump\u2019s not staying in Buckingham Palace is not a snub but simply an issue of logistics.\nIf Trump keeps to the traditions of a state visit, he will not be able to avoid encountering London demonstrators. The Trumps also plan to attend a June 5 ceremony in Portsmouth, far from London, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day.\nPortsmouth was one of the primary embarkation sites for the Allied operation that helped defeat Nazi Germany and liberate Europe during World War II.\nAccording to May\u2019s office, countries that fought alongside Britain in the military operation, as well as Germany, have been invited to attend. The gathering will include live performances, military displays and tributes to the Allied troops who fought in Normandy in World War II.\nPortsmouth City Council leader Gerald Vernon-Jackson told the BBC that Trump\u2019s attendance will \u201ctake away\u201d from the event and that presidential-level security could make it harder for veterans to attend.\n\u201cInevitably, if Donald Trump is in town, there will be controversy, there will be protests,\u201d Vernon-Jackson said. \u201cIt would have been an open-access event on the common. Now it will all be behind steel barriers.\u201d\nTrump will be in France the following day, where he will meet with President Emmanuel Macron and travel to Normandy to observe the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings at the Normandy American Cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer.",

                "html": "<p>Fresh cracks over impeachment emerged in the Democratic Party on Tuesday as another 2020 presidential candidate and a top Democratic chairman called for the House to initiate proceedings &mdash; even as Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed back on the idea.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III&rsquo;s report, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) became the latest White House hopeful to call for the party to impeach President Trump during a CNN town hall Monday night, joining candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Juli&aacute;n Castro in backing the effort to oust the president.</p>\n<p>Hours later, on Tuesday afternoon, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, doubled down on her push for impeachment in a lengthy Twitter storm, even calling out a fellow Democratic chairman with impeachment jurisdiction to, essentially, get moving.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ninety percent of the calls and mail I&rsquo;m receiving in my office support impeachment of Trump and so do I,&rdquo; wrote Waters, a longtime impeachment supporter who has teetered between vocal cheerleader of the idea and deferring to Pelosi. &ldquo;The impeachment resolution must start with &amp; be taken up by the Judiciary Committee. Rep. [Jerrold] Nadler is the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The developments come less than 24 hours after Pelosi (D-Calif.) sought to quell those calls for impeachment in her caucus, arguing in a letter to her members and on a rare conference call Monday night that Democrats can hold Trump accountable through aggressive investigations.</p>\n<p>Mueller&rsquo;s report identified 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice by Trump but did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Pelosi has long taken a cautious approach, viewing impeachment as divisive and politically precarious for Democrats. The party is torn between wanting to hold Trump to account for his actions and a fear of blowback that could upend their shot at ousting him in 2020.</p>\n<p>Asked about impeachment during a Tuesday interview for the Time 100 Summit in New York, Pelosi said that &ldquo;if the . . . fact-finding takes us there, we have no choice. But we&rsquo;re not there yet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Impeachment is a step that you have to take bringing the American people with you,&rdquo; said Pelosi, who often refers to public sentiment as critical for Democrats&rsquo; legislative agenda on health care, gun control and campaign finance reform. &ldquo;Again, without prejudice, without passion, without partisanship, but with a presentation of the facts.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>According to a recent Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted after the top findings of the special counsel were released, but before the report became public, roughly 6 in 10 Democrats supported impeachment. Only 41 percent of all voters said the same.</p>\n<p>Notably, the divide in the party &mdash; reflected both in the House and throughout the 2020 presidential field &mdash; doesn&rsquo;t fall along ideological lines. While many on the far left are clamoring for impeachment, perhaps the most liberal of the White House candidates, Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), offered a word of caution.</p>\n<p>If the House initiates impeachment proceedings, he said during a CNN town hall Monday, &ldquo;all that the Congress is talking about is impeaching Trump and Trump, Trump, Trump, and Mueller, Mueller, Mueller, and we&rsquo;re not talking about health care, we&rsquo;re not talking about raising the minimum wage to a living wage, we&rsquo;re not talking about combating climate change, we&rsquo;re not talking about sexism and racism and homophobia, and all of the issues that concern ordinary Americans &mdash; what I worry about is that works to Trump&rsquo;s advantage.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Pelosi pushed back on the notion of more Democrats endorsing impeachment. &ldquo;You would think so, as far as how it is amplified, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a growing number,&rdquo; she said. Pelosi, meanwhile, has argued that politics shouldn&rsquo;t dictate a decision on impeachment. But some in her party think she&rsquo;s too heavily gauging the political reaction and the fear that the party will look complacent if it allows Trump&rsquo;s actions to go unaddressed.</p>\n<p>At the same time, lawmakers expressed frustration with the Trump administration and its response to requests from the investigative panels. The Treasury Department missed a deadline to provide the Ways and Means Committee a copy of Trump&rsquo;s tax returns; White House lawyers blocked a former top security-clearance official from appearing for a subpoenaed deposition; and The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-plans-to-fight-house-subpoena-of-former-?tid=lk_inline_manual_22\">reported</a> that the Trump administration would seek to prohibit former White House counsel Donald McGahn from complying with a House subpoena.</p>\n<p>McGahn was a central witness in one of 10 potential instances of obstruction of justice laid out in Mueller&rsquo;s report.</p>\n<p>Pelosi accused the Trump administration of &ldquo;stonewalling&rdquo; on Tuesday &mdash; even as she announced plans to meet with Trump next week to discuss infrastructure legislation. She said the findings of the Mueller report, the investigations by congressional committees and the White House response had created a &ldquo;moment in our history&rdquo; and cast it as a constitutional issue of whether the legislative branch has a right to know.</p>\n<p>But amid the legal battle that&rsquo;s about to erupt in Washington as House Democrats challenge the White House&rsquo;s refusal to comply with their investigations and oversight, questions of impeachment continue to confront Democrats.</p>\n<p>On Monday, during the CNN town hall, Harris said that there was enough evidence that Trump obstructed justice, saying: &ldquo;I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.&rdquo; Calling herself a &ldquo;realist&rdquo; who knew that Senate Republicans would never vote to remove Trump from office, Harris said &ldquo;that doesn&rsquo;t mean the process shouldn't take place&rdquo; in the House.</p>\n<p>Pelosi, however, has argued the exact opposite, demanding before the Mueller report was released that any impeachment of the president receive bipartisan support. Republican reaction, however, has been muted if not celebratory as Trump allies claim the president did no wrong.</p>\n<p>Waters&rsquo;s pro-impeachment tweets Tuesday were particularly striking because she appeared to defer to Pelosi in the Monday evening caucus call with House members scattered across their districts for the two-week congressional recess. While the chair investigating Trump&rsquo;s business dealings told her fellow colleagues she supported impeachment, she made a point of saying she is not pushing for it or asking others to lobby the leadership with her.</p>\n<p>Waters&rsquo;s tone &mdash; at least on Twitter &mdash; was much more aggressive Tuesday. &ldquo;We must impeach Putin&rsquo;s [P]resident Trump!&rdquo; she wrote in one missive. &ldquo;The Constitution gives the responsibility to Congress to impeach an unfit president,&rdquo; she wrote in another, asking: &ldquo;What more do we need?&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Fresh cracks over impeachment emerged in the Democratic Party on Tuesday as another 2020 presidential candidate and a top Democratic chairman called for the House to initiate proceedings \u2014 even as Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed back on the idea.\nIn the aftermath of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) became the latest White House hopeful to call for the party to impeach President Trump during a CNN town hall Monday night, joining candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Juli\u00e1n Castro in backing the effort to oust the president.\nHours later, on Tuesday afternoon, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, doubled down on her push for impeachment in a lengthy Twitter storm, even calling out a fellow Democratic chairman with impeachment jurisdiction to, essentially, get moving.\n\u201cNinety percent of the calls and mail I\u2019m receiving in my office support impeachment of Trump and so do I,\u201d wrote Waters, a longtime impeachment supporter who has teetered between vocal cheerleader of the idea and deferring to Pelosi. \u201cThe impeachment resolution must start with & be taken up by the Judiciary Committee. Rep. [Jerrold] Nadler is the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\u201d\nThe developments come less than 24 hours after Pelosi (D-Calif.) sought to quell those calls for impeachment in her caucus, arguing in a letter to her members and on a rare conference call Monday night that Democrats can hold Trump accountable through aggressive investigations.\nMueller\u2019s report identified 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice by Trump but did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.\nPelosi has long taken a cautious approach, viewing impeachment as divisive and politically precarious for Democrats. The party is torn between wanting to hold Trump to account for his actions and a fear of blowback that could upend their shot at ousting him in 2020.\nAsked about impeachment during a Tuesday interview for the Time 100 Summit in New York, Pelosi said that \u201cif the . . . fact-finding takes us there, we have no choice. But we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\n\u201cImpeachment is a step that you have to take bringing the American people with you,\u201d said Pelosi, who often refers to public sentiment as critical for Democrats\u2019 legislative agenda on health care, gun control and campaign finance reform. \u201cAgain, without prejudice, without passion, without partisanship, but with a presentation of the facts.\u201d\nAccording to a recent Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted after the top findings of the special counsel were released, but before the report became public, roughly 6 in 10 Democrats supported impeachment. Only 41 percent of all voters said the same.\nNotably, the divide in the party \u2014 reflected both in the House and throughout the 2020 presidential field \u2014 doesn\u2019t fall along ideological lines. While many on the far left are clamoring for impeachment, perhaps the most liberal of the White House candidates, Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), offered a word of caution.\nIf the House initiates impeachment proceedings, he said during a CNN town hall Monday, \u201call that the Congress is talking about is impeaching Trump and Trump, Trump, Trump, and Mueller, Mueller, Mueller, and we\u2019re not talking about health care, we\u2019re not talking about raising the minimum wage to a living wage, we\u2019re not talking about combating climate change, we\u2019re not talking about sexism and racism and homophobia, and all of the issues that concern ordinary Americans \u2014 what I worry about is that works to Trump\u2019s advantage.\u201d\nPelosi pushed back on the notion of more Democrats endorsing impeachment. \u201cYou would think so, as far as how it is amplified, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a growing number,\u201d she said. Pelosi, meanwhile, has argued that politics shouldn\u2019t dictate a decision on impeachment. But some in her party think she\u2019s too heavily gauging the political reaction and the fear that the party will look complacent if it allows Trump\u2019s actions to go unaddressed.\nAt the same time, lawmakers expressed frustration with the Trump administration and its response to requests from the investigative panels. The Treasury Department missed a deadline to provide the Ways and Means Committee a copy of Trump\u2019s tax returns; White House lawyers blocked a former top security-clearance official from appearing for a subpoenaed deposition; and The Washington Post reported that the Trump administration would seek to prohibit former White House counsel Donald McGahn from complying with a House subpoena.\nMcGahn was a central witness in one of 10 potential instances of obstruction of justice laid out in Mueller\u2019s report.\nPelosi accused the Trump administration of \u201cstonewalling\u201d on Tuesday \u2014 even as she announced plans to meet with Trump next week to discuss infrastructure legislation. She said the findings of the Mueller report, the investigations by congressional committees and the White House response had created a \u201cmoment in our history\u201d and cast it as a constitutional issue of whether the legislative branch has a right to know.\nBut amid the legal battle that\u2019s about to erupt in Washington as House Democrats challenge the White House\u2019s refusal to comply with their investigations and oversight, questions of impeachment continue to confront Democrats.\nOn Monday, during the CNN town hall, Harris said that there was enough evidence that Trump obstructed justice, saying: \u201cI believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.\u201d Calling herself a \u201crealist\u201d who knew that Senate Republicans would never vote to remove Trump from office, Harris said \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean the process shouldn't take place\u201d in the House.\nPelosi, however, has argued the exact opposite, demanding before the Mueller report was released that any impeachment of the president receive bipartisan support. Republican reaction, however, has been muted if not celebratory as Trump allies claim the president did no wrong.\nWaters\u2019s pro-impeachment tweets Tuesday were particularly striking because she appeared to defer to Pelosi in the Monday evening caucus call with House members scattered across their districts for the two-week congressional recess. While the chair investigating Trump\u2019s business dealings told her fellow colleagues she supported impeachment, she made a point of saying she is not pushing for it or asking others to lobby the leadership with her.\nWaters\u2019s tone \u2014 at least on Twitter \u2014 was much more aggressive Tuesday. \u201cWe must impeach Putin\u2019s [P]resident Trump!\u201d she wrote in one missive. \u201cThe Constitution gives the responsibility to Congress to impeach an unfit president,\u201d she wrote in another, asking: \u201cWhat more do we need?\u201d",

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The White House plans to fight a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee for former White House counsel Donald McGahn to testify, according to people familiar with the matter, setting up another showdown in the aftermath of the special counsel report.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration also plans to oppose other requests from House committees for the testimony of current and former aides about actions in the White House described in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III&rsquo;s report, according to two people familiar with internal thinking who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke of the plans on the condition of anonymity.</p>\n<p>White House lawyers plan to tell attorneys for administration witnesses called by the House that they will be asserting executive privilege over their testimony, officials said.</p>\n<p>Such a move will intensify a power struggle between the Trump administration and congressional Democrats, potentially setting up a protracted court battle.</p>\n<p>McGahn was mentioned more than 150 times in Mueller&rsquo;s report and told investigators about how the president pressured him to oust the special counsel and then pushed him to publicly deny the episode.</p>\n<p>McGahn&rsquo;s lawyer, William Burck, began discussions with the Judiciary Committee about his potential testimony after the panel <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-democrats-issue-subpoena-for-former-white-house-lawyer-mcgahn/2019/04/22/e84f9d24-6542-11e9-8985-4cf30147bdca_story.html?utm_term=.611fb6233a06&tid=lk_inline_manual_8\">issued a subpoena Monday</a>, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>Securing McGahn&rsquo;s testimony would be a boon for the committee, which hopes to focus on potential obstruction of justice by Trump in a series of public hearings this spring while exploring other &ldquo;abuses of power,&rdquo; Democratic aides said.</p>\n<p>Public testimony from McGahn could create a spectacle that would parallel the June 1973 testimony of President Richard Nixon&rsquo;s former White House counsel, John Dean, whose live televised appearance before a Senate committee painted a vivid portrait for the country of the White House coverup of the Watergate burglary.</p>\n<p>People close to McGahn, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said McGahn is &ldquo;following the process&rdquo; and working with the White House on his next steps, despite Trump&rsquo;s public and private anger about his former counsel&rsquo;s prominence in the Mueller report.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not eager to testify. He&rsquo;s not reluctant. He got a subpoena. It compels him to testify. But there are some countervailing legal reasons that might prevent that,&rdquo; said one person close to McGahn, who described private discussions on the condition of anonymity. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to be in contempt of Congress; nor does he want to be in contempt of his ethical obligations and legal obligations as a former White House official.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump has told advisers that McGahn was disloyal to him, and he criticized the lawyer for taking extensive notes of meetings that were cited in Mueller&rsquo;s report. While initially portraying the report as an exoneration, Trump has grown frustrated with its depiction of his White House.</p>\n<p>The two men had an adversarial relationship, with McGahn contemplating quitting several times during his tenure. But he was also key to some of the president&rsquo;s main accomplishments, like the confirmation of two Supreme Court judges and a record number of federal judiciary appointments.</p>",

                "text": "The White House plans to fight a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee for former White House counsel Donald McGahn to testify, according to people familiar with the matter, setting up another showdown in the aftermath of the special counsel report.\nThe Trump administration also plans to oppose other requests from House committees for the testimony of current and former aides about actions in the White House described in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report, according to two people familiar with internal thinking who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke of the plans on the condition of anonymity.\nWhite House lawyers plan to tell attorneys for administration witnesses called by the House that they will be asserting executive privilege over their testimony, officials said.\nSuch a move will intensify a power struggle between the Trump administration and congressional Democrats, potentially setting up a protracted court battle.\nMcGahn was mentioned more than 150 times in Mueller\u2019s report and told investigators about how the president pressured him to oust the special counsel and then pushed him to publicly deny the episode.\nMcGahn\u2019s lawyer, William Burck, began discussions with the Judiciary Committee about his potential testimony after the panel issued a subpoena Monday, according to people familiar with the matter.\nSecuring McGahn\u2019s testimony would be a boon for the committee, which hopes to focus on potential obstruction of justice by Trump in a series of public hearings this spring while exploring other \u201cabuses of power,\u201d Democratic aides said.\nPublic testimony from McGahn could create a spectacle that would parallel the June 1973 testimony of President Richard Nixon\u2019s former White House counsel, John Dean, whose live televised appearance before a Senate committee painted a vivid portrait for the country of the White House coverup of the Watergate burglary.\nPeople close to McGahn, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said McGahn is \u201cfollowing the process\u201d and working with the White House on his next steps, despite Trump\u2019s public and private anger about his former counsel\u2019s prominence in the Mueller report.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not eager to testify. He\u2019s not reluctant. He got a subpoena. It compels him to testify. But there are some countervailing legal reasons that might prevent that,\u201d said one person close to McGahn, who described private discussions on the condition of anonymity. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be in contempt of Congress; nor does he want to be in contempt of his ethical obligations and legal obligations as a former White House official.\u201d\nTrump has told advisers that McGahn was disloyal to him, and he criticized the lawyer for taking extensive notes of meetings that were cited in Mueller\u2019s report. While initially portraying the report as an exoneration, Trump has grown frustrated with its depiction of his White House.\nThe two men had an adversarial relationship, with McGahn contemplating quitting several times during his tenure. But he was also key to some of the president\u2019s main accomplishments, like the confirmation of two Supreme Court judges and a record number of federal judiciary appointments.",

(Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>On Monday, in the aftermath of bombings that ultimately left more than 300 people dead, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena announced a nationwide state of emergency, which will dramatically expand security forces&rsquo; ability to detain and question suspects in the attacks.</p>\n<p>So far, some 40 people have been arrested in connection to the coordinated bombings, which targeted churches and hotels on Easter Sunday. <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/354320ae7110498ab41602f663ce6bbe\">The Associated Press reported</a> that some of those who have been arrested so far include the driver of a vehicle that allegedly transported some of the suicide bombers, as well as the owner of a property where some of them allegedly lived. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/sri-lanka-bombings-latest-updates/2019/04/22/f2afe32a-6531-11e9-a698-2a8f808c9cfb_story.html?utm_term=.470c14f2ae8e&tid=lk_inline_manual_3\">As The Washington Post reported</a>, at least three are being held by the Terrorist Investigation Department, and lawmakers warned that others linked to the perpetrators may still be armed and on the run.</p>\n<p>But as Sri Lanka seeks to establish order in the aftermath of the attacks, human rights experts are urging officials to carefully consider how they treat suspects. The emergency laws enacted Monday will be familiar to many Sri Lankans because the government relied on such powers to crack down on suspected rebels during its decades-long civil war. They were also briefly enacted last year after communal violence broke out in part of the country.</p>\n<p>The country&rsquo;s civil war ended in 2009, but human rights groups say a controversial anti-terrorism law enacted in the 1970s is still in effect, allowing security forces to detain suspects without warrants and keep them behind bars for up to 18 months without their having to appear in court. That law was used throughout the country&rsquo;s conflict, and the emergency powers put in place this week offer security forces even more sweeping ability to detain suspects without court orders.</p>\n<p>Sirisena has pledged to replace the country&rsquo;s anti-terrorism legislation, but the government has so far failed to do so, raising concerns among human rights experts, who say <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/01/29/locked-without-evidence/abuses-under-sri-lankas-prevention-terrorism-act\">they have documented cases in which detainees in Sri Lanka have been tortured</a> and sexually abused in custody.</p>\n<p>U.N. officials have also raised concerns over the treatment of Sri Lankan detainees. In 2016, Juan Mendez, then-U.N. special rapporteur on torture, <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19943\">said that in Sri Lanka</a>, fewer cases of torture are reported now than were during the civil war, but that &ldquo;the practice of interrogation under physical and mental coercion still exists and severe forms of torture &hellip;. continue to be used.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Since arrests were made related to this week&rsquo;s bombings, &ldquo;we are not getting a lot of information about what is happening to those who are arrested,&rdquo; said Thyagi Ruwanpathirana, South Asia regional researcher at Amnesty International. And it&rsquo;s not clear whether they were arrested under the emergency provisions or under the counterterrorism legislation.</p>\n<p>But in the aftermath of such attacks, &ldquo;minorities tend to bear most of the brunt,&rdquo; she said. In Sri Lanka, a majority-Buddhist country, &ldquo;there was already a growing sentiment against Muslims,&rdquo; Ruwanpathirana noted, raising further concern that the nature of the attacks and the Islamic State&rsquo;s claim of responsibility could fuel existing religious tensions. And for detainees in Sri Lanka, &ldquo;torture is rife,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said Sri Lanka is still dealing with the aftermath of previous security operations and that the families of people who disappeared in earlier crackdowns are still searching for answers. &ldquo;They have responded to terror threats in the past in a way that has not been rights-respecting,&rdquo; Ganguly said of Sri Lankan security forces. &ldquo;We are very concerned that none of that be repeated this time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the final weeks of the country&rsquo;s brutal civil war, &ldquo;people were picked up and executed; there were allegations of rape,&rdquo; she said. This time, Sri Lankan authorities should prosecute the perpetrators, she said, but &ldquo;not repeat the mistakes of the past.&quot;</p>",

                "text": "On Monday, in the aftermath of bombings that ultimately left more than 300 people dead, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena announced a nationwide state of emergency, which will dramatically expand security forces\u2019 ability to detain and question suspects in the attacks.\nSo far, some 40 people have been arrested in connection to the coordinated bombings, which targeted churches and hotels on Easter Sunday. The Associated Press reported that some of those who have been arrested so far include the driver of a vehicle that allegedly transported some of the suicide bombers, as well as the owner of a property where some of them allegedly lived. As The Washington Post reported, at least three are being held by the Terrorist Investigation Department, and lawmakers warned that others linked to the perpetrators may still be armed and on the run.\nBut as Sri Lanka seeks to establish order in the aftermath of the attacks, human rights experts are urging officials to carefully consider how they treat suspects. The emergency laws enacted Monday will be familiar to many Sri Lankans because the government relied on such powers to crack down on suspected rebels during its decades-long civil war. They were also briefly enacted last year after communal violence broke out in part of the country.\nThe country\u2019s civil war ended in 2009, but human rights groups say a controversial anti-terrorism law enacted in the 1970s is still in effect, allowing security forces to detain suspects without warrants and keep them behind bars for up to 18 months without their having to appear in court. That law was used throughout the country\u2019s conflict, and the emergency powers put in place this week offer security forces even more sweeping ability to detain suspects without court orders.\nSirisena has pledged to replace the country\u2019s anti-terrorism legislation, but the government has so far failed to do so, raising concerns among human rights experts, who say they have documented cases in which detainees in Sri Lanka have been tortured and sexually abused in custody.\nU.N. officials have also raised concerns over the treatment of Sri Lankan detainees. In 2016, Juan Mendez, then-U.N. special rapporteur on torture, said that in Sri Lanka, fewer cases of torture are reported now than were during the civil war, but that \u201cthe practice of interrogation under physical and mental coercion still exists and severe forms of torture \u2026. continue to be used.\u201d\nSince arrests were made related to this week\u2019s bombings, \u201cwe are not getting a lot of information about what is happening to those who are arrested,\u201d said Thyagi Ruwanpathirana, South Asia regional researcher at Amnesty International. And it\u2019s not clear whether they were arrested under the emergency provisions or under the counterterrorism legislation.\nBut in the aftermath of such attacks, \u201cminorities tend to bear most of the brunt,\u201d she said. In Sri Lanka, a majority-Buddhist country, \u201cthere was already a growing sentiment against Muslims,\u201d Ruwanpathirana noted, raising further concern that the nature of the attacks and the Islamic State\u2019s claim of responsibility could fuel existing religious tensions. And for detainees in Sri Lanka, \u201ctorture is rife,\u201d she said.\nMeenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said Sri Lanka is still dealing with the aftermath of previous security operations and that the families of people who disappeared in earlier crackdowns are still searching for answers. \u201cThey have responded to terror threats in the past in a way that has not been rights-respecting,\u201d Ganguly said of Sri Lankan security forces. \u201cWe are very concerned that none of that be repeated this time.\u201d\nIn the final weeks of the country\u2019s brutal civil war, \u201cpeople were picked up and executed; there were allegations of rape,\u201d she said. This time, Sri Lankan authorities should prosecute the perpetrators, she said, but \u201cnot repeat the mistakes of the past.\"",

                "html": "<p>LONDON &mdash; One thousand days after British voters said they wanted to leave the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May conceded Wednesday that she now must ask E.U. leaders to delay Brexit for three months &mdash; because Parliament has failed to pass her unloved deal for departure.</p>\n<p>Standing in the House of Commons, May blamed lawmakers for the impasse. Parliament has twice overwhelmingly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/british-parliament-to-vote-tuesday-on-theresa-mays-new-brexit-plan-but-the-tweaked-deal-faces-strong-opposition/2019/03/12/850e2c52-4405-11e9-94ab-d2dda3c0df52_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_3\">rejected</a> the withdrawal agreement she spent two years negotiating with her European counterparts. Because lawmakers have also said they do not want Britain to crash out of the trading bloc without a deal, the result is paralysis.</p>\n<p>A visibly frustrated May said she would seek only a short extension, until June 30. If the delay were longer, Britain as a member of the E.U. would have to participate in upcoming elections for the European Parliament.</p>\n<p>A longer delay would also provide &ldquo;endless hours and days of this House carrying on, contemplating its navel on Europe,&rdquo; May charged, underscoring her contention that Parliament, not her government, is responsible for the chaos.</p>\n<p>The prime minister&rsquo;s cutting remarks were met with hoots and jeers, even by members of her Conservative Party, whose rebels have not only voted against her Brexit plan but tried to unseat her.</p>\n<p>Many lawmakers blame May for the shambles of Brexit, accusing her of weak leadership, a failure to seek consensus early on &mdash; and a bad deal they fear could yoke Britain to E.U. rules and regulations forever.</p>\n<p>In the evening, the prime minister doubled down. She stepped to the lectern at 10 Downing Street to talk directly to the people &mdash; and point the finger again.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You, the public, have had enough,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are tired of the infighting. You are tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows. Tired of MPs talking about nothing else but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children&rsquo;s schools, our National Health Service and knife crime. You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In a letter delivered Wednesday to Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, May wrote that she was &ldquo;confident&rdquo; the House of Commons would eventually pass a tweaked withdrawal agreement, but not by March 29, when Britain is scheduled to leave the E.U.</p>\n<p>May will now travel, hat in hand, to a summit of skeptical European leaders in Brussels on Thursday. This will mark at least the 17th time the gathering has been forced to discuss Brexit since the June 2016 referendum.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The central scenario is a no-deal exit,&rdquo; French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced Wednesday, making clear his government&rsquo;s hard-line approach.</p>\n<p>But at a later news conference in Brussels, Tusk said that &ldquo;a short extension will be possible, but it will be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Brussels officials cautioned that May&rsquo;s last-minute letter asking for more time probably arrived too late for European leaders to respond to it definitively Thursday.

                "text": "LONDON \u2014 One thousand days after British voters said they wanted to leave the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May conceded Wednesday that she now must ask E.U. leaders to delay Brexit for three months \u2014 because Parliament has failed to pass her unloved deal for departure.\nStanding in the House of Commons, May blamed lawmakers for the impasse. Parliament has twice overwhelmingly rejected the withdrawal agreement she spent two years negotiating with her European counterparts. Because lawmakers have also said they do not want Britain to crash out of the trading bloc without a deal, the result is paralysis.\nA visibly frustrated May said she would seek only a short extension, until June 30. If the delay were longer, Britain as a member of the E.U. would have to participate in upcoming elections for the European Parliament.\nA longer delay would also provide \u201cendless hours and days of this House carrying on, contemplating its navel on Europe,\u201d May charged, underscoring her contention that Parliament, not her government, is responsible for the chaos.\nThe prime minister\u2019s cutting remarks were met with hoots and jeers, even by members of her Conservative Party, whose rebels have not only voted against her Brexit plan but tried to unseat her.\nMany lawmakers blame May for the shambles of Brexit, accusing her of weak leadership, a failure to seek consensus early on \u2014 and a bad deal they fear could yoke Britain to E.U. rules and regulations forever.\nIn the evening, the prime minister doubled down. She stepped to the lectern at 10 Downing Street to talk directly to the people \u2014 and point the finger again.\n\u201cYou, the public, have had enough,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are tired of the infighting. You are tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows. Tired of MPs talking about nothing else but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children\u2019s schools, our National Health Service and knife crime. You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side.\u201d\nIn a letter delivered Wednesday to Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, May wrote that she was \u201cconfident\u201d the House of Commons would eventually pass a tweaked withdrawal agreement, but not by March 29, when Britain is scheduled to leave the E.U.\nMay will now travel, hat in hand, to a summit of skeptical European leaders in Brussels on Thursday. This will mark at least the 17th time the gathering has been forced to discuss Brexit since the June 2016 referendum.\n\u201cThe central scenario is a no-deal exit,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced Wednesday, making clear his government\u2019s hard-line approach.\nBut at a later news conference in Brussels, Tusk said that \u201ca short extension will be possible, but it will be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons.\u201d\nBrussels officials cautioned that May\u2019s last-minute letter asking for more time probably arrived too late for European leaders to respond to it definitively Thursday. Leaders need to consult with their cabinets and parliaments, policymakers said.\nIn briefings, diplomats from several European countries made clear they would do everything they could to avoid having Britain leave without the safety of a withdrawal agreement. \u201cWe will go to great lengths to avoid a hard Brexit,\u201d one senior E.U. diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a frank assessment.\nThe British prime minister is struggling to persuade 10 members of the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, which props up her minority government, to back her deal. The thinking is that if the DUP swings behind her, some hardcore Brexiteers in her own party may hold their noses and support her plan.\nMay told Parliament that even if an extension is granted, a \u201cno-deal Brexit\u201d wasn\u2019t off the table. Instead, the cliff edge would simply be pushed back.\nThat alarmed some lawmakers who think exiting the bloc without a deal would be economically disastrous for the country. Samuel Gyimah, a Conservative lawmaker, told the BBC that a short extension \u201cincreased chances of a \u2018no deal\u2019 by 60 percent\u201d and that it was \u201cdownright reckless\u201d of the government to keep it as an option.\nBritish reporters were told by 10 Downing Street that May might try to pass a revised deal as early as next week. But the prime minister faces procedural head winds, as well as political ones. The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, ruled Monday that he would not let May bring a recycled plan back for a third vote unless it is \u201csubstantially\u201d different.\nIn Brussels, astonished diplomats increasingly expect that an extension will not be decided on until the hours before March 30.\nAlthough people involved in the negotiations said Wednesday that there was little appetite for ejecting Britain against its will, they were fearful that further surprises in London could lead to what one senior E.U. diplomat called \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d\n\u201cAll we have done, leading to nowhere,\u201d the diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss calculations ahead of the meeting Thursday. \u201cThe blame game will be a very nasty one, of course. Who caused it? I think we all know the answer, but it can very easily be turned against the E.U.\u201d\nMay\u2019s short extension request left E.U. leaders facing a tricky decision: whether to grant the delay when they are unsure she can get the divorce deal approved by her own Parliament.\nIf the European Union were to offer a delay but the House of Commons then rejected the deal a third time, \u201cthen we are, I\u2019m sorry to say, in God\u2019s hands,\u201d European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told Deutschlandfunk radio before May submitted her request. \u201cBut I think even God has a limit to his patience.\u201d\nOne major concern in Europe about a short extension is that if Britain did not take part in late-May elections for the European Parliament but then asked for yet more time at the end of June, the legal consequences could affect the basic functioning of European institutions.\nAny E.U. citizen could potentially challenge laws passed by the new European Parliament, for example, because the bloc\u2019s treaties require that all European citizens have the chance to vote and elect representatives to the body. Diplomats also worry that if British policymakers still have a say in E.U. decisions, they could hold unrelated deliberations hostage as a way to demand Brexit concessions.\nThe European Commission believes a June 30 Brexit delay poses serious risks, and Juncker \u201cformally warned\u201d May in a phone call Wednesday that she should not seek an extension later than the May 23 European elections if Britain does not plan to participate in them, Margaritis Schinas, a commission spokesman, said Wednesday.

Lawmakers wondered what she meant when she said, \u201cAs prime minister, I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than June 30.\u201d",

They also serve as a detailed reminder of the broad array of wrongdoing of which Cohen was accused and to which he eventually pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p>The first warrant obtained by the special counsel&rsquo;s office was dated July 18, 2017, and sought Cohen&rsquo;s emails. A second warrant less than a month later sought the cloud backup files related to his phones. A third warrant sought by Mueller&rsquo;s office sought Cohen emails dating to June 2015.</p>",

Mueller III obtained court-approved warrants to search the emails of President Trump\u2019s attorney Michael Cohen in July 2017 as his office investigated whether Cohen had illegally worked for foreign entities, according to newly unsealed documents illustrating how the investigation moved quickly and quietly to scour the digital trails of the president\u2019s associates.\nThe search warrants unsealed Tuesday in Cohen\u2019s case offer new insight into how Mueller and his team handed off a key part of the Cohen investigation to federal prosecutors in New York in early 2018 and how much evidence prosecutors already had against Cohen even before they searched his office, home and hotel room last April. They also serve as a detailed reminder of the broad array of wrongdoing of which Cohen was accused and to which he eventually pleaded guilty.\nThe first warrant obtained by the special counsel\u2019s office was dated July 18, 2017, and sought Cohen\u2019s emails. A second warrant less than a month later sought the cloud backup files related to his phones. A third warrant sought by Mueller\u2019s office sought Cohen emails dating to June 2015.",

                "html": "<p>U.S. authorities have charged an American engineer and a Chinese businessman with economic espionage and conspiring to steal sophisticated turbine designs to benefit the government of China and their personal business interests.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5976172-19-CR-156-Indictment-Sealed-Redacted.html\">14-count indictment</a>, unsealed Tuesday, alleges Xiaoqing Zheng of Niskayuna, N.Y., and Zhaoxi Zhang of China&rsquo;s Liaoning province teamed up to filch millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of General Electric&rsquo;s trade secrets.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is one of the most significant indictments involving China&rsquo;s alleged theft of technology,&rdquo; said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. &ldquo;The technologies involved in the indictment go to the heart of China&rsquo;s deficit in turbine technology.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Zheng, who has pleaded not guilty, was arraigned Tuesday in Albany, N.Y, and released pending trial. Attempts to reach him were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment, though the Chinese government has consistently denied that it engages in economic espionage.</p>\n<p>China has identified aerospace technology as vital to its economic and military objectives. The Justice Department in its indictment tied the trade-secret theft to China&rsquo;s &ldquo;Made in 2025&rdquo; initiative, aimed at vaulting China&rsquo;s economy into higher-value areas in competition with the United States, including in aviation equipment and power generation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The indictment alleges a textbook example of the Chinese government&rsquo;s strategy to rob American companies of their intellectual property and to replicate their products in Chinese factories, enabling Chinese companies to replace the American company first in the Chinese market and later worldwide,&rdquo; said Assistant Attorney General John Demers.</p>\n<p>GE, with approval from the U.S. government, has pursued legitimate business opportunities with China. In 2011, for instance, in a move unrelated to the case brought by the Justice Department, the company entered into a joint venture with AVIC, a Chinese state-owned aerospace company, to share technology for aviation software packages.</p>\n<p>Aviation software and turbine technology are the two critical areas China faces challenges in developing its own world-class commercial and military aircraft, experts say. &ldquo;The technologies involved in this indictment could very well advance their capabilities to help them overcome this remaining critical deficit in the aerospace field,&rdquo; Wessel said.</p>\n<p>The case is unusual for the apparent direct interaction the defendants, who are not accused of being government spies or officials, are alleged to have had with Communist Party officials to discuss a &ldquo;strategic partnership&rdquo; with the research organizations to develop aircraft engine technology.</p>\n<p>According to prosecutors, Zheng, 56, worked as an engineer at GE Power and Water in Schenectady, N.Y. While there, he allegedly exploited his access to the company&rsquo;s files, stealing proprietary design models, engineering drawings and specifications dealing with components and testing systems for GE gas and steam turbines, the indictment contends.</p>\n<p>He is accused of emailing and transferring many of the files to his business partner, Zhang, 47, in China. The indictment alleges that they used GE&rsquo;s trade secrets to advance their business interests in two Chinese companies that make turbine parts &mdash; Liaoning Tianyi Aviation Technology and Nanjing Tianyi Avi Tech.</p>\n<p>In a statement, a GE spokesperson said the company was cooperating with federal authorities. &ldquo;We aggressively protect and defend our intellectual property and have strict processes in place for identifying these issues and partnering with law enforcement,&rdquo; the statement says.</p>\n<p>The indictment also alleges that from March 2016 through August 2018, Zheng and Zhang conspired to commit economic espionage to benefit the Chinese government and related entities, including Shenyang Aerospace University, the Shenyang Aeroengine Research Institute and the Huaihai Institute of Technology.</p>\n<p>U.S. officials alleged that, through the two Chinese companies, Zheng and Zhang received financial support from the Chinese government and coordinated with Chinese government officials to enter into research agreements with state-owned institutions to develop turbine technologies.</p>\n<p>China&rsquo;s economic espionage is estimated to cost U.S. businesses tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars a year. &ldquo;Chinese spying has surpassed Cold War levels,&rdquo; said James Lewis, a cyber-policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>\n<p>Authorities say that to conceal his alleged activities, Zheng used encryption and a technique called &ldquo;steganography&rsquo;&rsquo; to hide secret material in otherwise ordinary files or messages &mdash; in one instance in a digital photograph of a sunset, the indictment says.</p>\n<p>Zheng also is accused of lying to FBI agents about emailing GE&rsquo;s confidential material to contacts in China, according to the indictment.</p>\n<p>The link between the alleged theft of trade secrets and China&rsquo;s economic program illustrates why the Justice Department sees this as a national security priority, said John Carlin, an assistant attorney general in the Obama administration. &ldquo;It is to counter what they lay out as a Chinese state plan to steal from, replicate and replace U.S. companies in both their domestic market and worldwide,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>This post has been updated to include a statement from General Electric.</p>",

                "text": "U.S. authorities have charged an American engineer and a Chinese businessman with economic espionage and conspiring to steal sophisticated turbine designs to benefit the government of China and their personal business interests.\nThe 14-count indictment, unsealed Tuesday, alleges Xiaoqing Zheng of Niskayuna, N.Y., and Zhaoxi Zhang of China\u2019s Liaoning province teamed up to filch millions of dollars\u2019 worth of General Electric\u2019s trade secrets.\n\u201cThis is one of the most significant indictments involving China\u2019s alleged theft of technology,\u201d said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. \u201cThe technologies involved in the indictment go to the heart of China\u2019s deficit in turbine technology.\u201d\nZheng, who has pleaded not guilty, was arraigned Tuesday in Albany, N.Y, and released pending trial. Attempts to reach him were unsuccessful.\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment, though the Chinese government has consistently denied that it engages in economic espionage.\nChina has identified aerospace technology as vital to its economic and military objectives. The Justice Department in its indictment tied the trade-secret theft to China\u2019s \u201cMade in 2025\u201d initiative, aimed at vaulting China\u2019s economy into higher-value areas in competition with the United States, including in aviation equipment and power generation.\n\u201cThe indictment alleges a textbook example of the Chinese government\u2019s strategy to rob American companies of their intellectual property and to replicate their products in Chinese factories, enabling Chinese companies to replace the American company first in the Chinese market and later worldwide,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John Demers.\nGE, with approval from the U.S. government, has pursued legitimate business opportunities with China. In 2011, for instance, in a move unrelated to the case brought by the Justice Department, the company entered into a joint venture with AVIC, a Chinese state-owned aerospace company, to share technology for aviation software packages.\nAviation software and turbine technology are the two critical areas China faces challenges in developing its own world-class commercial and military aircraft, experts say. \u201cThe technologies involved in this indictment could very well advance their capabilities to help them overcome this remaining critical deficit in the aerospace field,\u201d Wessel said.\nThe case is unusual for the apparent direct interaction the defendants, who are not accused of being government spies or officials, are alleged to have had with Communist Party officials to discuss a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d with the research organizations to develop aircraft engine technology.\nAccording to prosecutors, Zheng, 56, worked as an engineer at GE Power and Water in Schenectady, N.Y. While there, he allegedly exploited his access to the company\u2019s files, stealing proprietary design models, engineering drawings and specifications dealing with components and testing systems for GE gas and steam turbines, the indictment contends.\nHe is accused of emailing and transferring many of the files to his business partner, Zhang, 47, in China. The indictment alleges that they used GE\u2019s trade secrets to advance their business interests in two Chinese companies that make turbine parts \u2014 Liaoning Tianyi Aviation Technology and Nanjing Tianyi Avi Tech.\nIn a statement, a GE spokesperson said the company was cooperating with federal authorities. \u201cWe aggressively protect and defend our intellectual property and have strict processes in place for identifying these issues and partnering with law enforcement,\u201d the statement says.\nThe indictment also alleges that from March 2016 through August 2018, Zheng and Zhang conspired to commit economic espionage to benefit the Chinese government and related entities, including Shenyang Aerospace University, the Shenyang Aeroengine Research Institute and the Huaihai Institute of Technology.\nU.S. officials alleged that, through the two Chinese companies, Zheng and Zhang received financial support from the Chinese government and coordinated with Chinese government officials to enter into research agreements with state-owned institutions to develop turbine technologies.\nChina\u2019s economic espionage is estimated to cost U.S. businesses tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars a year. \u201cChinese spying has surpassed Cold War levels,\u201d said James Lewis, a cyber-policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nAuthorities say that to conceal his alleged activities, Zheng used encryption and a technique called \u201csteganography\u2019\u2019 to hide secret material in otherwise ordinary files or messages \u2014 in one instance in a digital photograph of a sunset, the indictment says.\nZheng also is accused of lying to FBI agents about emailing GE\u2019s confidential material to contacts in China, according to the indictment.\nThe link between the alleged theft of trade secrets and China\u2019s economic program illustrates why the Justice Department sees this as a national security priority, said John Carlin, an assistant attorney general in the Obama administration. \u201cIt is to counter what they lay out as a Chinese state plan to steal from, replicate and replace U.S. companies in both their domestic market and worldwide,\u201d he said.\nThis post has been updated to include a statement from General Electric.",

                "html": "<p>ZUBAYDIYA, Iraq &mdash; On a muddy berm on the edge of a wheat farm about 100 miles south of Baghdad, a dozen flatbed trucks carrying some $14 million in precious cargo slowly line up before dawn.</p>\n<p>At first light, men with sticks and hammers begin banging on the cages stacked on the back of the trucks &mdash; rousing 14,000 pigeons into a frenetic and unruly chorus of deep coos and grunts. Moments later, at the blast of an air horn, the cages are opened in unison and the birds take flight, the force of 28,000 wings generating gusts of wind as the pigeons hurtle in a single direction: to Baghdad.</p>\n<p>Six months of practice runs and strict conditioning culminate in a launch that lasts less than a minute. But the birds carry with them the hopes of men who have spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours training them.</p>\n<p>From October to March, when Iraq&rsquo;s winter temperatures climb down from the triple digits of the summer, thousands of Iraqis race their pigeons in contests that can stretch as far as 600 miles, from Mosul in the north to Basra in the south, competing for bragging rights, modest purses and the satisfaction of knowing they raised a champion.</p>\n<p>Elite birds, which can fly up to 90 mph, are much sought after, with racing pigeons from a coveted European lineage costing $4,000. One such bird sold at auction for $93,000 in Basra.</p>\n<p>A stable of pigeons usually numbers between 50 and 100, with each prize bird requiring about $100 worth of feed, vitamins, herbal teas and omega-3 supplements per racing season to maintain peak fitness.</p>\n<p>Pigeon racing, a sport on the decline in the United States and Europe, where it was developed, is taking off in Iraq. After nearly 20 years of conflict in the country, the rising popularity of pigeon racing is a signal that &ldquo;our people want to practice peace,&rdquo; said Kamil Khinyab, the 52-year-old undisputed godfather of pigeon racing in Iraq.</p>\n<p>It is a peace that comes high above the perpetual gridlock, heavily armed soldiers and chaos of Baghdad&rsquo;s streets. In their rooftop pigeon lofts, the hobbyists are in total control.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If your pigeon wins, it&rsquo;s only because of your efforts. If it loses, it&rsquo;s because you need to do better raising it,&rdquo; Khinyab said with a smirk.</p>\n<p>The ranks of the pigeon fanciers include medical doctors, academics, high-level military, police, intelligence service officers and engineers. These are prestige professions, and judging from the investment required, this is not a sport for the riffraff.</p>\n<p>They are known locally as &ldquo;matyarchi.&rdquo; At best, they&rsquo;re regarded as loners who waste their life doting on a bird that lacks any prestige. At worst, they&rsquo;re suspected of being perverts who use their high-perched pigeon lofts to spy on neighbors or sneak a peek at the woman next door hanging laundry.</p>\n<p>One saying in Iraq goes, &ldquo;Never trust the testimony of a matyarchi.&rdquo; When someone looks to the sky furtively, others often inquire: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you? You have the eyes of a matyarchi.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The term itself drips with contempt. The Arabic suffix &ldquo;chi&rdquo; is generally reserved for bad habits and jobs of low social status. In Iraq, an excessive drinker is an &ldquo;arakchi.&rdquo; A gambler is known as a &ldquo;qamarchi,&rdquo; while the guy who fixes flat tires is &ldquo;bancharchi.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Khinyab and his community of pigeon fanciers say they&rsquo;re engaging in a cerebral and competitive gentleman&rsquo;s sport. &ldquo;What makes someone successful at this hobby is intelligence above all &mdash; then care and mercy for the birds, which Iraqis have in abundance,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>An engineer by training, he came to racing in 1999 when a friend showed him how a pigeon, just 3 months old, could find its way home from 140 miles away.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was fascinated with how intelligent they were, and I fell in love,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>He asked his friend and a cousin who also raised pigeons to give him a few birds to train, and he set up a rooftop coop, building high walls around it to protect his reputation. Khinyab collected 23 birds, paying 210,000 dinars for one he was sure would be a perennial winner. Back then, that sum could furnish an entire house or buy a reliable car.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I faced a lot of criticism from my family, but I&rsquo;d show them [European] magazines where they listed pigeons worth $5,000 and $10,000.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>His early results didn&rsquo;t help his cause. During training sessions, all 23 of his pigeons flew away and never returned.</p>\n<p>Despite the costly blunder, Khinyab rebuilt his stable. He learned the key was to launch the pigeons close to their loft at first, until they reliably returned home, and then gradually increase the distance over time.</p>\n<p>What started as an obsession has now turned into a career. He runs Baghdad&rsquo;s best-known pigeon club &mdash; a place that sells antifungal and anti-worm solutions, vitamins and other imported products needed to raise the fastest, strongest and smartest pigeons. It is also a gathering place for pigeon fanciers, a must stop for visitors from other provinces keen on learning the latest tradecraft.</p>\n<p>On a recent evening, Khinyab presided over a boisterous gathering of competitors who had come to register their pigeons for a race the next day. As male and female birds were separated to prevent unwanted breeding, the owners exchanged warm greetings with hugs and kisses, referring to one another with the honorific &ldquo;Champion.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Back in the day, owners would track their pigeons by tearing a dinar note in half, so that each half showed the same serial number, and then affixing one half to a pigeon&rsquo;s leg and giving the other to a judge. The owners would wait at home for their birds to arrive, then grab the pigeon&rsquo;s half of the dinar note and furiously drive to a club and check in with the judges.</p>\n<p>Khinyab devised a better system. He divided a map of Baghdad into districts, and judges were assigned to locations within a mile of all the lofts in their district. The new system was quickly embraced by fellow racers.</p>\n<p>But it took the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein to bring the races into the modern era. The country, which had been cut off by sanctions and government corruption, was flooded with imports of all types. Amid the new marvel of cellphones and the myriad brands of blue jeans, there was now a possibility to import computer devices known as Bricon machines, invented in Belgium for the sole purpose of pigeon racing. Pigeons could be outfitted with a leg ring containing their registration number, and it would be digitally recorded when they reached their loft.</p>\n<p>Just as pigeon racing has exploded in popularity, so too has the practice of kidnapping prize birds for ransom. One village, located along the Baghdad-to-Basra Grand Prix route, has become infamous.</p>\n<p>Young men and boys wait on the edges of the village, Talihah, until they spot flocks of birds flying toward their destination. Using sticks, stones and pieces of barbed wire, the would-be kidnappers try to bring down the birds without killing them.</p>\n<p>Most owners attach their phone number to their birds&rsquo; legs. The pirates call and demand a sum of about $20 to $30 or mobile phone credits.</p>\n<p>Along Talihah&rsquo;s muddy, unpaved roads, the bandits are unapologetic. Asked whether the village is indeed known for pigeon piracy, Hussein, a 32-year-old shopkeeper, proudly responded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If they manage to cross our village safely, they&rsquo;re in the clear,&rdquo; added 19-year-old Wissam. &ldquo;This is the most dangerous place for them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sattar Dayekh, a 40-year-old pigeon breeder who lives in the village, doesn&rsquo;t condone the banditry, but he said he understands why his neighbors commit it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These are poor kids looking to make some money,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If the racers don&rsquo;t pay them, they&rsquo;d stop hunting them. Besides, they can afford it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A few days after the Zubaydiya race, Khadim Hamid, a 49-year-old who owns a welding shop, was taking stock of his racing pigeons. All 50 made it home, but none had broken into the top 10 &mdash; the benchmark for a good run. Though his home is stacked with trophies, the latest result bothered him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To be a winner, you should know what your bird needs only by looking at it and provide it for it,&rdquo; he grumbled.</p>\n<p>Race purses are never more than $100 or $200 for a first-place finish. The real money comes in raising champions and selling them to other racers for breeding.</p>\n<p>And then there&rsquo;s the sheer satisfaction of bragging rights. Pigeon owners spend the six months ahead of the racing season chirping about how they are the best.</p>\n<p>So he said he was contemplating spending a little more money to renovate his loft, which sits atop his two-story house in a leafy neighborhood of Baghdad. It would run him about $4,000.</p>",

                "text": "ZUBAYDIYA, Iraq \u2014 On a muddy berm on the edge of a wheat farm about 100 miles south of Baghdad, a dozen flatbed trucks carrying some $14 million in precious cargo slowly line up before dawn.\nAt first light, men with sticks and hammers begin banging on the cages stacked on the back of the trucks \u2014 rousing 14,000 pigeons into a frenetic and unruly chorus of deep coos and grunts. Moments later, at the blast of an air horn, the cages are opened in unison and the birds take flight, the force of 28,000 wings generating gusts of wind as the pigeons hurtle in a single direction: to Baghdad.\nSix months of practice runs and strict conditioning culminate in a launch that lasts less than a minute. But the birds carry with them the hopes of men who have spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours training them.\nFrom October to March, when Iraq\u2019s winter temperatures climb down from the triple digits of the summer, thousands of Iraqis race their pigeons in contests that can stretch as far as 600 miles, from Mosul in the north to Basra in the south, competing for bragging rights, modest purses and the satisfaction of knowing they raised a champion.\nElite birds, which can fly up to 90 mph, are much sought after, with racing pigeons from a coveted European lineage costing $4,000. One such bird sold at auction for $93,000 in Basra.\nA stable of pigeons usually numbers between 50 and 100, with each prize bird requiring about $100 worth of feed, vitamins, herbal teas and omega-3 supplements per racing season to maintain peak fitness.\nPigeon racing, a sport on the decline in the United States and Europe, where it was developed, is taking off in Iraq. After nearly 20 years of conflict in the country, the rising popularity of pigeon racing is a signal that \u201cour people want to practice peace,\u201d said Kamil Khinyab, the 52-year-old undisputed godfather of pigeon racing in Iraq.\nIt is a peace that comes high above the perpetual gridlock, heavily armed soldiers and chaos of Baghdad\u2019s streets. In their rooftop pigeon lofts, the hobbyists are in total control.\n\u201cIf your pigeon wins, it\u2019s only because of your efforts. If it loses, it\u2019s because you need to do better raising it,\u201d Khinyab said with a smirk.\nThe ranks of the pigeon fanciers include medical doctors, academics, high-level military, police, intelligence service officers and engineers. These are prestige professions, and judging from the investment required, this is not a sport for the riffraff.\nThey are known locally as \u201cmatyarchi.\u201d At best, they\u2019re regarded as loners who waste their life doting on a bird that lacks any prestige. At worst, they\u2019re suspected of being perverts who use their high-perched pigeon lofts to spy on neighbors or sneak a peek at the woman next door hanging laundry.\nOne saying in Iraq goes, \u201cNever trust the testimony of a matyarchi.\u201d When someone looks to the sky furtively, others often inquire: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You have the eyes of a matyarchi.\u201d\nThe term itself drips with contempt. The Arabic suffix \u201cchi\u201d is generally reserved for bad habits and jobs of low social status. In Iraq, an excessive drinker is an \u201carakchi.\u201d A gambler is known as a \u201cqamarchi,\u201d while the guy who fixes flat tires is \u201cbancharchi.\u201d\nBut Khinyab and his community of pigeon fanciers say they\u2019re engaging in a cerebral and competitive gentleman\u2019s sport. \u201cWhat makes someone successful at this hobby is intelligence above all \u2014 then care and mercy for the birds, which Iraqis have in abundance,\u201d he said.\nAn engineer by training, he came to racing in 1999 when a friend showed him how a pigeon, just 3 months old, could find its way home from 140 miles away.\n\u201cI was fascinated with how intelligent they were, and I fell in love,\u201d he said.\nHe asked his friend and a cousin who also raised pigeons to give him a few birds to train, and he set up a rooftop coop, building high walls around it to protect his reputation. Khinyab collected 23 birds, paying 210,000 dinars for one he was sure would be a perennial winner. Back then, that sum could furnish an entire house or buy a reliable car.\n\u201cI faced a lot of criticism from my family, but I\u2019d show them [European] magazines where they listed pigeons worth $5,000 and $10,000.\u201d\nHis early results didn\u2019t help his cause. During training sessions, all 23 of his pigeons flew away and never returned.\nDespite the costly blunder, Khinyab rebuilt his stable. He learned the key was to launch the pigeons close to their loft at first, until they reliably returned home, and then gradually increase the distance over time.\nWhat started as an obsession has now turned into a career. He runs Baghdad\u2019s best-known pigeon club \u2014 a place that sells antifungal and anti-worm solutions, vitamins and other imported products needed to raise the fastest, strongest and smartest pigeons. It is also a gathering place for pigeon fanciers, a must stop for visitors from other provinces keen on learning the latest tradecraft.\nOn a recent evening, Khinyab presided over a boisterous gathering of competitors who had come to register their pigeons for a race the next day. As male and female birds were separated to prevent unwanted breeding, the owners exchanged warm greetings with hugs and kisses, referring to one another with the honorific \u201cChampion.\u201d\nBack in the day, owners would track their pigeons by tearing a dinar note in half, so that each half showed the same serial number, and then affixing one half to a pigeon\u2019s leg and giving the other to a judge. The owners would wait at home for their birds to arrive, then grab the pigeon\u2019s half of the dinar note and furiously drive to a club and check in with the judges.\nKhinyab devised a better system. He divided a map of Baghdad into districts, and judges were assigned to locations within a mile of all the lofts in their district. The new system was quickly embraced by fellow racers.\nBut it took the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein to bring the races into the modern era. The country, which had been cut off by sanctions and government corruption, was flooded with imports of all types. Amid the new marvel of cellphones and the myriad brands of blue jeans, there was now a possibility to import computer devices known as Bricon machines, invented in Belgium for the sole purpose of pigeon racing. Pigeons could be outfitted with a leg ring containing their registration number, and it would be digitally recorded when they reached their loft.\nJust as pigeon racing has exploded in popularity, so too has the practice of kidnapping prize birds for ransom. One village, located along the Baghdad-to-Basra Grand Prix route, has become infamous.\nYoung men and boys wait on the edges of the village, Talihah, until they spot flocks of birds flying toward their destination. Using sticks, stones and pieces of barbed wire, the would-be kidnappers try to bring down the birds without killing them.\nMost owners attach their phone number to their birds\u2019 legs. The pirates call and demand a sum of about $20 to $30 or mobile phone credits.\nAlong Talihah\u2019s muddy, unpaved roads, the bandits are unapologetic. Asked whether the village is indeed known for pigeon piracy, Hussein, a 32-year-old shopkeeper, proudly responded, \u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d\n\u201cIf they manage to cross our village safely, they\u2019re in the clear,\u201d added 19-year-old Wissam. \u201cThis is the most dangerous place for them.\u201d\nSattar Dayekh, a 40-year-old pigeon breeder who lives in the village, doesn\u2019t condone the banditry, but he said he understands why his neighbors commit it.\n\u201cThese are poor kids looking to make some money,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the racers don\u2019t pay them, they\u2019d stop hunting them. Besides, they can afford it.\u201d\nA few days after the Zubaydiya race, Khadim Hamid, a 49-year-old who owns a welding shop, was taking stock of his racing pigeons. All 50 made it home, but none had broken into the top 10 \u2014 the benchmark for a good run. Though his home is stacked with trophies, the latest result bothered him.\n\u201cTo be a winner, you should know what your bird needs only by looking at it and provide it for it,\u201d he grumbled.\nRace purses are never more than $100 or $200 for a first-place finish. The real money comes in raising champions and selling them to other racers for breeding.\nAnd then there\u2019s the sheer satisfaction of bragging rights. Pigeon owners spend the six months ahead of the racing season chirping about how they are the best.\nSo he said he was contemplating spending a little more money to renovate his loft, which sits atop his two-story house in a leafy neighborhood of Baghdad. It would run him about $4,000.",
