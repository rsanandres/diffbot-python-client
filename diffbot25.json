This isn&rsquo;t a comprehensive review, as we tried the device in a controlled environment for about 15 minutes. But with augmented reality headsets (of which we have tried many) the flaws typically start to emerge almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what stood out when we tried the new HoloLens 2:</p>\n<h2>Field of view</h2>\n<p>The field of view on the HoloLens 2 is noticeably larger than its predecessor, released in 2016, which makes the experience drastically better from the first moment you put on the headset. This was the biggest concern with the first iteration of the headset&mdash;you just couldn&rsquo;t see enough of the hologram for it to feel immersive.</p>\n<p>Microsoft says there will be a walkthrough and calibration on the setup screen the first time users boot up the device, but for now it had a &ldquo;manual&rdquo; calibration where you shift your gaze to about 16 different points around the screen, which locks in the eye tracking. (More on that later.) The calibration box filled the entire field of view, which looked to be about the size of a 65&Prime; television from five or six feet away.</p>\n<p>At first (and at second) it felt impressive, and a step up from the previous generation of the device. However, once you started playing with objects bigger than the size of a microwave, the limitations of the field of view start to become apparent. It&rsquo;s jarring to see digital items suddenly get cut out of view when they&rsquo;re too big for the device&rsquo;s field of view. If you have a floating screen of text, like a browser window or an info box describing a task in an industrial setting, seeing it disappear when you look elsewhere may create a brief moment of panic.</p>\n<p>But if you&rsquo;re looking at a few objects that aren&rsquo;t enormous, or you have the space to step back and see the objects from afar, it&rsquo;s a genuinely great AR experience. The objects don&rsquo;t look necessarily real, as they&rsquo;re translucent and still have some blur, but text is crisp and legible.</p>\n<h2>Comfort</h2>\n<p>Microsoft has redesigned how the HoloLens 2 sits on your head. Instead of the &ldquo;floating ring&rdquo; that had to be delicately positioned on your head for the original HoloLens, the industrial design direction for the HoloLens 2 was to mimic the ease and universality of putting on a hat.</p>\n<figure><figcaption>The original HoloLens.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;I want it to be instinctual,&rdquo; Microsoft technical fellow Alex Kipman, who led the development of the HoloLens 2, told Quartz. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it to be a learned behavior.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Here, Microsoft succeeded: putting the device on your head and adjusting it is easy and intuitive. There&rsquo;s a single knob on the back of the headset that turns to tighten or loosen the band.</p>\n<p>But the biggest change in making the HoloLens 2 more comfortable is the redistribution of weight. The first device was front-heavy, since all the computing chips were located in the front, and in this iteration Microsoft has moved the center of gravity from 11 millimeters in front of the eye to 70 millimeters behind it, according to Kipman. Those numbers don&rsquo;t really mean much conceptually, but when you put the device on, you immediately understand that this is a much more stable device. More of the weight is balanced around your whole head, rather than feeling like you&rsquo;re wearing a very heavy headlamp.</p>\n<p>You can also wear the HoloLens 2 with glasses, which is very nice for us nerds who wear glasses.</p>\n<h2>Eye tracking</h2>\n<p>Most impressive, however, was the HoloLens 2&rsquo;s eye-tracking capabilities, which means it can tell where you&rsquo;re looking and respond to voice commands to interact with that specific object. After the one-time eye-tracking calibration mentioned before, the sensors could accurately pick out one object about the size of a grapefruit from a closely-grouped array 6 feet away.</p>\n<p>There were a few &ldquo;wow&rdquo; moments for me, and they all were centered around the way Microsoft had managed to make eye-tracking feel so integrated into the AR experience. During the demonstration, the Microsoft HoloLens designer who was walking me through the demonstration asked me to look at one of the grapefruit-sized objects that looked like a multi-faceted gem, and say &ldquo;pop.&rdquo; I did, and the one I was looking at popped. There was no gesture, no pointing, and the device didn&rsquo;t preemptively pop the object I was looking at when the other person in the room said &ldquo;pop.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If you want to use gestures, Microsoft has expanded the types of gestures you could use to interact with the device. While in the first HoloLens you needed to master a specific pinch gesture for the cameras and depth sensors to understand certain inputs, the HoloLens 2 is much more forgiving, making the experience feel intuitive off the bat. For instance, you can move digital objects with one or two hands, and use more natural grips to move or resize things.</p>\n<p>The real value of eye tracking is demonstrated when it comes to reading. A roughly 32&Prime; text box floated next to a digital hummingbird, displaying a bit of text about the bird. As I read, the HoloLens 2 detected how fast my eyes were moving down the text and began to scroll, accelerating and decelerating as my reading sped up and slowed down. The effect was seamless. I intuitively looked down at the bottom of the text box when I saw a bit of white space after a paragraph, and more text scrolled up to meet my gaze.</p>\n<p>A lot of this sounds like a fluffy review of a device I got special access to, but after trying nearly every VR headset, smart glasses device, and AR headset at the last few CES conferences and tech shows (including the Magic Leap), the HoloLens 2 was the first that genuinely impressed me with the technology that was already in the device, rather than the promise of the platform.</p>\n<p>Microsoft isn&rsquo;t selling these to consumers like you and me just yet&mdash;the HoloLens 2 is still an enterprise device with a price tag of $3,500. The company is partnering with healthcare and engineering firms for the first rollout, for frontline workers to use on the job. But consumer AR is undoubtedly coming, and whenever it decides to make a consumer headset, Microsoft has a head start.</p>",

More of the weight is balanced around your whole head, rather than feeling like you\u2019re wearing a very heavy headlamp.\nYou can also wear the HoloLens 2 with glasses, which is very nice for us nerds who wear glasses.\nEye tracking\nMost impressive, however, was the HoloLens 2\u2019s eye-tracking capabilities, which means it can tell where you\u2019re looking and respond to voice commands to interact with that specific object. After the one-time eye-tracking calibration mentioned before, the sensors could accurately pick out one object about the size of a grapefruit from a closely-grouped array 6 feet away.\nThere were a few \u201cwow\u201d moments for me, and they all were centered around the way Microsoft had managed to make eye-tracking feel so integrated into the AR experience. During the demonstration, the Microsoft HoloLens designer who was walking me through the demonstration asked me to look at one of the grapefruit-sized objects that looked like a multi-faceted gem, and say \u201cpop.\u201d I did, and the one I was looking at popped. There was no gesture, no pointing, and the device didn\u2019t preemptively pop the object I was looking at when the other person in the room said \u201cpop.\u201d\nIf you want to use gestures, Microsoft has expanded the types of gestures you could use to interact with the device. While in the first HoloLens you needed to master a specific pinch gesture for the cameras and depth sensors to understand certain inputs, the HoloLens 2 is much more forgiving, making the experience feel intuitive off the bat. For instance, you can move digital objects with one or two hands, and use more natural grips to move or resize things.\nThe real value of eye tracking is demonstrated when it comes to reading. A roughly 32\u2033 text box floated next to a digital hummingbird, displaying a bit of text about the bird. As I read, the HoloLens 2 detected how fast my eyes were moving down the text and began to scroll, accelerating and decelerating as my reading sped up and slowed down. The effect was seamless. I intuitively looked down at the bottom of the text box when I saw a bit of white space after a paragraph, and more text scrolled up to meet my gaze.\nA lot of this sounds like a fluffy review of a device I got special access to, but after trying nearly every VR headset, smart glasses device, and AR headset at the last few CES conferences and tech shows (including the Magic Leap), the HoloLens 2 was the first that genuinely impressed me with the technology that was already in the device, rather than the promise of the platform.\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t selling these to consumers like you and me just yet\u2014the HoloLens 2 is still an enterprise device with a price tag of $3,500. The company is partnering with healthcare and engineering firms for the first rollout, for frontline workers to use on the job. But consumer AR is undoubtedly coming, and whenever it decides to make a consumer headset, Microsoft has a head start.",

But in today&rsquo;s world, speed-to-scale entrepreneurship is what we need to improve society, transform industries, and create massive value for customers, employees, and investors. That&rsquo;s what we call &ldquo;blitzscaling&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Take Amazon, for example. O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s position resembles that of the ardent bibliophile who bemoans the loss of the corner bookshop. While this stance might seem appealing at first glance, blocking speed and scale for the sake of preserving the past is reactionary and counterproductive. If you broaden your lens to include all stakeholders, Amazon is clearly better for the world.</p>\n<p>Customers value and benefit from the convenience, price, and selection of Amazon, which is why the company is, by a wide margin, <a href=\"https://www.idealog.com/blog/changing-book-business-seems-flowing-downhill-amazon/\">America&rsquo;s largest bookseller</a>.</p>\n<p>Publishers and authors (like O&rsquo;Reilly and us) also benefit from Amazon&rsquo;s success. 2018 set yet another <a href=\"https://qz.com/1510303/book-sales/\">all-time record</a> for the number of paper books sold in the United States, as has been repeatedly true during the era of Amazon.</p>\n<p>And from a financial perspective, any investor would be better off buying stock in Amazon than buying and share of a corner bookshop; if you invested $100 in Amazon&rsquo;s 1997 initial public offering (IPO), those shares <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082715/if-you-had-invested-right-after-amazons-ipo.asp\">would have been worth about $120,000</a> in 2018.</p>\n<p>Finally, and importantly, society is better off because Amazon makes the system for distributing books (and other products) vastly more productive, freeing up resources for other value-creating investments.</p>\n<p>Blitzscaling is not a reckless gamble; it is a calculated risk.</p>\n<p>By and large, the only groups that actually prefer the corner bookshop to Amazon are the independent bookstore owners themselves (quite understandably) and those with the luxury of indulging in sentimental nostalgia.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Reilly is not the only one to worry about the negative impact of scaling. Tim Wu&rsquo;s recent book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Curse-Bigness-Antitrust-New-Gilded/dp/0999745468\">The Curse of Bigness</a></em>, for example, argues that unrestrained scale concentrates too much power in too few hands. And, as the industrial revolution showed us, <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/industrial-revolution/industrial-revolution#section_5\">there are some real costs to scale</a>.</p>\n<p>However, we believe&mdash;ardently and passionately&mdash;that responsible scaling is one of the most powerful forces for making people better off, just like the industrial revolution eventually made the world a vastly better place. When the market conditions are right, you should blitzscale for the benefit of all stakeholders: customers, employees, investors, and society.</p>\n<p>Our difference of opinion with O&rsquo;Reilly boils down to four key points:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Blitzscaling is a response to market dynamics, not the cause. </strong>In a connected world, someone will build an Amazon. The only question is who and how.</li><li><strong>Blitzscaling is a strategic technique for moving faster, not a reckless gamble. </strong>Entrepreneurs can and should blitzscale thoughtfully and responsibly.</li><li><strong>You don&rsquo;t get to choose whether to have competition, just whether you play to win. </strong>Almost no one ever races unopposed.</li><li><strong>You can&mdash;and should&mdash;blitzscale responsibly. </strong>Speed and scale are generally good for the world; when the outcome is positive, the faster you get there, the better off all stakeholders are.</li></ol>\n<p>Taken together, these points help clarify why we believe in blitzscaling, but should also offer helpful guidance on when to deploy it, and how to shape its effects for good.</p>\n<h2><strong>Blitzscaling is a response to market dynamics, not the cause</strong></h2>\n<p>One of O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s main criticisms of blitzscaling is that creates a winner-takes-most or winner-takes-all market. In our book, we describe these as <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Lf8GtMe4M\">Glengarry Glen Ross</a></em> markets, in which the only truly valuable outcome is winning first prize. In the movie, this was a Cadillac:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As you all know, first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado. Anybody wanna see second prize? Second prize&rsquo;s a set of steak knives. Third prize is you&rsquo;re fired.</p></blockquote>\n<p>O&rsquo;Reilly describes this as a &ldquo;dark pattern,&rdquo; and argues that blitzscaling harmed the market for ride-hailing because &ldquo;investors, awash in cheap capital, anointed the winners rather than letting the market decide who should succeed and who should fail.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This is a fundamental misunderstanding of blitzscaling. Blitzscaling is a response to market dynamics, not their cause. Some markets are <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em> markets, and some are not. Entrepreneurs and investors can&rsquo;t transform a normal market into a <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em> market, regardless of how they might want to do just that.</p>\n<p>What makes this tricky is that markets evolve, and an innovative technology or business model can transform a normal market into a <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em> market. Indeed, many great companies have been built by entrepreneurs who recognized that a technological change transformed the nature of an important market, enabling an innovative, blitzscalable business model. Microsoft and Apple believed that microprocessors would allow consumers to have their own computers. Amazon saw that the internet would change retail. And Apple used the capacitive touch screen to develop a new paradigm for computing.</p>\n<p>Nowhere in our book do we recommend that all entrepreneurs blitzscale. In fact, we even have a section titled &ldquo;Can I Choose Not To Blitzscale?&rdquo; in which we state that &ldquo;blitzscaling is not for everyone.&rdquo; In the same year that Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, Thomas Keller launched The French Laundry restaurant. It&rsquo;s a great business. It still serves just 60 customers per day.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s article describes two businesses from his own career at O&rsquo;Reilly&mdash;the Global Network Navigator (GNN) web portal, which he sold to AOL, and the Website web server, which eventually fell by the wayside. O&rsquo;Reilly argues that both of these were blitzscaling opportunities that he believes O&rsquo;Reilly was correct to pass on.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s logic seems self-defeating. Imagine if he did blitzscale GNN and created the equivalent of Google years earlier&mdash;the value for society, customers, investors, and employees would be enormous, not to mention for O&rsquo;Reilly himself.</p>\n<p>If you want to build a world-changing company, then the massive impact of successful blitzscaling is the technique to use.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s own examples demonstrate the difference between a blitzscalable and non-blitzscalable market. Google realized that being the way to find the world&rsquo;s information was a blitzscalable market, thanks to the network effects in its AdWords revenue engine. If O&rsquo;Reilly had that same insight in 1995, it could have been an amazing blitzscaling opportunity. Nor would it have required O&rsquo;Reilly to bet the company; many blitzscaling opportunities perform better as spin-offs or spin-outs. Not only does this protect the parent company and allow raising outside capital to fund growth, but the independence and focus increases the chances of success.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, web servers are not a blitzscalable market. O&rsquo;Reilly points out that the Website web server was eclipsed by Netscape, which was in turn crushed by Microsoft&mdash;but that victory was short lived. Today, <a href=\"https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2018/08/24/august-2018-web-server-survey.html\">there is no one dominant player in web servers</a>. Like any businesses, Netscape or Microsoft would have wanted web servers to become a <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em> market, but neither could make that happen, despite their best efforts.</p>\n<p>When we look at the broader trends, however, <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em> markets are increasing. Thanks to the internet and other globalizing technologies, the entire world has entered <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Alliance-Managing-Talent-Networked-Age/dp/1625275773\">the Networked Age</a>. Markets for goods, services, and capital (both human and financial) are more liquid and global than ever before, and technology is becoming a core part of every industry. The result is that more and more markets are subject to forces like network effects that tend to produce winner-takes-most dynamics. Bookselling isn&rsquo;t a winner-takes-most market&mdash;but blitzscaling the Kindle platform allowed Amazon to become <a href=\"https://www.idealog.com/blog/changing-book-business-seems-flowing-downhill-amazon/\">the runaway leader</a> in what has turned out to be a winner-takes-most market for ebooks (and allowed readers to get instant access to nearly any book they wanted).</p>\n<p>In other words, it won the Cadillac.</p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the power to change the market dynamics (as is almost always the case), doesn&rsquo;t it make sense to adopt the techniques that best fit them? Or to put it another way: If you owned a corner bookstore in 1997, would you be better off today if you had invested $10,000 in expanding your physical store&mdash;or in the Amazon IPO?</p>\n<h2><strong>Blitzscaling is a strategic technique for moving faster, not a reckless gamble</strong></h2>\n<p>Another class of criticisms that O&rsquo;Reilly levels are based in his belief that blitzscaling is simply a matter of buying growth. For example, O&rsquo;Reilly writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ironically, Hoffman and Yeh&rsquo;s book is full of superb practical advice about innovation, execution, and strategic focus, but it&rsquo;s wrapped in the flawed promise that start-ups can achieve similar market dominance as these storied companies by force-feeding inefficient growth.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Elsewhere, O&rsquo;Reilly asserts that the companies we cite in our book aren&rsquo;t actually examples of blitzscaling:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Each of these companies [Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon] achieved profitability (or in Amazon&rsquo;s case, positive cash flow) long before its IPO, and growth wasn&rsquo;t driven by a blitzkrieg of spending to acquire customers below cost, but by breakthrough products and services, and by strategic business model innovations that were rooted in a future that the competition didn&rsquo;t yet understand. These companies didn&rsquo;t blitzscale; they scaled sustainably.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The implication is that blitzscaling ignores things like &ldquo;business model innovations that were rooted in a future that the competition didn&rsquo;t yet understand&rdquo; in favor of &ldquo;spending to acquire customers below cost.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The truth is, we actually <em>agree</em> with O&rsquo;Reilly about the importance of innovation. In fact, the entire second chapter of <em>Blitzscaling</em> is titled &ldquo;Business Model Innovation,&rdquo; and focuses on explaining why the simplistic dot-com philosophy of &ldquo;get big fast&rdquo; usually doesn&rsquo;t work. In it we explicitly state:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The real value creation comes when innovative technology enables innovative products and services with innovative business models&hellip;.What sets companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook apart, even from other successful high-tech companies, is that they have consistently been able to design and execute business models with characteristics that allow them to quickly achieve massive scale and sustainable competitive advantage.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Blitzscaling is not a reckless gamble; it is a calculated risk that should be taken when the market dynamics make it the best strategy to win that market. We define it as the pursuit of rapid growth by prioritizing speed over efficiency in the face of uncertainty, not &ldquo;lose money and make it up in volume.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Every successful company&rsquo;s long-term goal is to build a sustainable business. But sometimes the fastest path to sustainable market leadership involves pursuing a strategy that is unprofitable in the short term in order to reach a position that is more profitable in the long term. In a <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em> market, the greatest risk is often not taking enough risk, since all the capital efficiency in the world won&rsquo;t help if a competitor achieves enduring market leadership.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the fastest path to sustainable market leadership involves pursuing a strategy that is unprofitable in the short term.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Reilly unwittingly illustrates this point by telling the story of Sunil Paul, a friend and a successful serial entrepreneur who filed a patent on the core elements of GPS-enabled ride-hailing in 2000. The founder of early internet startup Freeloader (acquired for $38 million in 1996) and anti-spam company Brightmail (acquired for $370 million in 2004), Paul went on to pioneer the ride-hailing space. Yet despite literally patenting ride-hailing in 2000, his own venture, Sidecar, lost out to the more aggressive scaling of Uber and Lyft.</p>\n<p>Paul&rsquo;s track record as a serial entrepreneur was far more impressive than either Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick or Lyft co-founder Logan Green. He also had backing from well-known venture capital investors like Union Square Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Google Ventures, and even Richard Branson. In a vacuum, who wouldn&rsquo;t bet on the successful multi-millionaire serial entrepreneur with blue-chip backers and a patent on the entire concept of the industry? And yet Uber and Lyft are the market leaders, with <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/12/12/18134882/lyft-uber-ride-car-market-share\">a combined 98% of the US market</a>, while Sidecar shut down in 2015.</p>\n<p>The difference? Uber and Lyft blitzscaled. Sidecar didn&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>To blitzscale successfully, you need a successful business model. But being right isn&rsquo;t enough, as Paul&rsquo;s example demonstrates. If you develop a successful business model but don&rsquo;t scale, someone else will eventually copy that model, scale, and drive you out of business.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s conclusion is that blitzscaling is bad because it allowed Uber and Lyft to win the ride-hailing market, rather than Paul, the original inventor of the concept. Our conclusion is that Paul&rsquo;s example demonstrates that while you can build successful companies without blitzscaling (e.g., Freeloader and Brightmail), to win a <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em> market like ride-hailing, you need a tight focus on speed, regardless of how experienced and qualified the entrepreneur.</p>\n<p>This begs the billion-dollar question, how can you tell if a market is blitzscalable?</p>\n<p>The &ldquo;Business Model Innovation&rdquo; chapter of <em>Blitzscaling</em> provides our answer, by delineating the four key growth factors and two key growth limiters that entrepreneurs and investors can use to assess blitzscalability.</p>\n<ul><li>The first key growth factor is a <strong>big market</strong>. Blitzscaling is all about scale, which means a blitzscaling opportunity needs a lot of headroom to grow. For example, Amazon&rsquo;s market is, well, <em>everything</em>. Plenty of headroom there!</li><li>The second is <strong>distribution</strong>&mdash;the ability to get product into the hands of customers. If the key to success is achieving critical scale, massive distribution is essential. Dropbox made a great file-sharing product, for instance, but it was their viral marketing campaign that allowed them to cheaply acquire millions of customers.</li><li>The third is <strong>high gross margins</strong>. In other words, what percentage of sales are available to pay for growth, and to reward investors for financing that growth. Some blitzscaling companies might deliberately price their products lower, making their actual gross margins significantly less than their potential gross margins. Amazon has done this over and over, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/new-research-from-tso-logic-shows-aws-costs-get-lower-every-year/\">even in its highly profitable Amazon Web Service business</a>. But this should be viewed as a temporary tactic, not a long-term sustainable business model.</li><li>The fourth are <strong>network effects</strong> (or some other source of long-term competitive advantage). Network effects occur when each new node you add to a network (say, each new home that&rsquo;s added to Airbnb) increases the value of that network to the other nodes. Businesses with strong network effects such as eBay (which has networks of both buyers and sellers) can build enduring market leadership that lasts years or even decades.</li></ul>\n<p>But possessing the key growth factors is not enough to make a company blitzscalable, because the presence of the growth limiters can block sustainable growth. There are two main hurdles that need to be considered.</p>\n<ul><li>The first key growth limiter is a <strong>lack of product-market fit</strong>. Product-market fit, as defined by Stanford&rsquo;s Steve Blank, occurs when a product&rsquo;s features are a strong fit with its market&rsquo;s needs, as measured by a combination of usage, retention, and sales. Companies like Groupon that grow rapidly, but whose core products are not compelling to customers, can&rsquo;t successfully blitzscale because they can&rsquo;t retain those customers long enough to build long-term value.</li><li>The second is a <strong>lack of operational scalability</strong>. There is no such thing as a company that generates billions of dollars of revenue with a team of less than 10 people. Blitzscaling requires building a substantial organization at an abnormally rapid pace. Traditional companies might grow 10% per year; blitzscaling companies might grow 10% per month or even per week.</li></ul>\n<p>Sunil Paul&rsquo;s company Brightmail is a great example of a good business that wasn&rsquo;t blitzscalable. Brightmail did well on distribution, where it struck up partnerships with many leading internet service providers (ISPs), and also had decent gross margins. But it lacked the requisite market size and network effects to be a blitzscaling opportunity: The market for spam-filtering technology was limited to a relatively small group of ISPs and therefore didn&rsquo;t represent a multibillion-dollar opportunity.</p>\n<p>Blitzscaling works when being the first company to achieve critical scale produces enduring leadership in a massively valuable market. When those conditions aren&rsquo;t met, attempting to blitzscale is simply a good way to waste your time and energy&mdash;and investor capital.</p>\n<h2><strong>You don&rsquo;t get to choose whether to have competition, just whether you play to win</strong></h2>\n<p>In his piece, O&rsquo;Reilly defines an implicit distinction between what he characterizes as organic and inorganic market development. He writes of the ride-hailing market:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Would a market that grew more organically&mdash;like the web, e-commerce, smartphones, or mobile mapping services&mdash;have created more value over the long term?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ironically, these four markets are, in fact, the province of blitzscalers. Google&rsquo;s Chrome is the preeminent web browser, Amazon is the preeminent e-commerce option, Google and Apple are the leaders in smartphone operating systems (except in China, where Chinese blitzscalers like Xiaomi hold sway), and Google operates the leading mobile mapping services.</p>\n<p>As an individual entrepreneur, you might prefer a world without competition, but the rest of the world is better off when competition occurs. Competition drives better products and services, lower prices, and people taking risks to innovate. But it also means that people have to compete, which may feel stressful and force you out of your comfort zone. It may not seem fair, but if you choose not to compete for leadership in a <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em> market, you&rsquo;re choosing to lose.</p>\n<p>In the book, we detail the story of how Airbnb responded when Rocket Internet, an internet-venture builder founded by the German Samwer brothers, created a European clone of the service called Wimdu. Airbnb was a small 40-person company at the time, and Wimdu, raised close to $100 million, hired 400 employees, and opened 20 offices. Then Rocket Internet offered to sell Wimdu to Airbnb for a 25% stake in Airbnb. (I [Reid] remember when Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky told me about the offer.)</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re forced to outsprint a capable competitor, you can achieve your goals more quickly than you ever imagined.</p>\n<p>Groupon&rsquo;s co-founder and then-CEO Andrew Mason advised Brian to take the deal. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll probably kill you,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Do you think Airbnb wanted that kind of competition? Of course not. But unless Airbnb agreed to a merger, it had only two options. One, it could rise to the challenge and compete by launching its own blitzscaling effort. Or two, it could insist on &ldquo;organic&rdquo; growth and lose, thus fulfilling Mason&rsquo;s prediction.</p>\n<p>Airbnb chose to compete, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/24/airbnb-bags-112-million-in-series-b-from-andreessen-and-others/\">raising its own war chest of $112 million</a> and opening nine offices around the world in less than a year. It was stressful and uncomfortable, but it worked. Airbnb&rsquo;s bookings increased by a factor of 10 during that time, and it left Wimdu in the rear-view mirror. In 2018, Wimdu shut down, while a now-profitable Airbnb was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/most-valuable-private-us-startups-2018-10#4-airbnb-31-billion-24\">one of the world&rsquo;s most valuable startups</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Samwers gave us a gift,&rdquo; Chesky admitted many years later in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W608u6sBFpo\">the Blitzscaling class</a> we taught at Stanford University in 2015. &ldquo;They forced us to scale faster than we ever would have.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the upside of competition. When you&rsquo;re forced to outsprint a capable competitor, you can achieve your goals more quickly than you ever imagined, creating more value than you ever imagined&mdash;and not just for the founders and employees, but for customers and other stakeholders, too.</p>\n<h2><strong>You can&mdash;and should&mdash;blitzscale responsibly</strong></h2>\n<p>O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s final criticism centers around his belief that what he calls &ldquo;runaway growth&rdquo; is bad for the world. O&rsquo;Reilly erroneously believes that <em>Blitzscaling</em> ignores the question of responsibility. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve talked so far mainly about the investment distortions that blitzscaling introduces. But there is another point that I wish Hoffman and Yeh had made in their book.</p><p>Assume for a moment that blitzscaling is indeed a recipe for companies to achieve the kind of market dominance that has been achieved by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google. Assume that technology is often a winner-takes-all market, and that blitzscaling is indeed a powerful tool in the arsenal of those in pursuit of the win.</p><p>What is the responsibility of the winners? And what happens to those who don&rsquo;t win?</p></blockquote>\n<p>We stand with O&rsquo;Reilly in this call for responsible scaling. We completely agree that the blitzscalers who win their markets have a moral obligation to those markets and their associated stakeholders. That is precisely why we leave the reader with this message in the final chapter in the book, &ldquo;Responsible Blitzscaling.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This passage from that chapter speaks directly to the need for responsibility, both morally and practically:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We believe that the responsibilities of a blitzscaler go beyond simply maximizing shareholder value while obeying the law; you are also responsible for how the actions of your business impact the larger society. But even beyond the moral imperatives, responsible blitzscaling is good business strategy. Society provides the ecosystem in which you live, and in which your businesses operate, which means that it can rightly claim some responsibility for your success. In other words, your success is contingent upon society functioning properly. Here in Silicon Valley, some might fantasize about floating cities in international waters, but the fact is that our successes rely on the rule of law, robust financial markets, and an education system that produces talented employees and a healthy market of consumers.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>To ensure that this concept spreads as broadly as possible, we are publishing the chapter on responsible blitzscaling in full so that even those who don&rsquo;t have the book can freely access it. You can find it <a href=\"http://qz.com/1572736\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>To blitzscale, or not to blitzscale?</strong></h2>\n<p>There are many legitimate reasons not to blitzscale.</p>\n<p>To start with, the chance of failure is high&mdash;as it is for any startup. As O&rsquo;Reilly points out, the venture-capital model is a &ldquo;home run&rdquo; model, where most investments fail and the massive scale and impact of the few successes makes the model work. This means that the chance of success for any individual entrepreneur, even those who are blitzscaling, is small.</p>\n<p>Thus, if your main goal is to operate a successful business for decades (or even generations), provide good products to your customers, and make a good living for you and your employees, then you should follow O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s advice. That is a laudable and time-honored achievement.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Reilly cites a number of these successfully bootstrapped businesses in his piece, including Mailchimp, Atlassian, Shutterstock, Basecamp, and RXBAR. All of these are great businesses with happy customers. All of their founders and employees have done well. Combined, they have under 8,000 employees (as measured on LinkedIn), and a market capitalization of just about $30 billion.</p>\n<p>Great numbers, to be sure&mdash;but Amazon alone has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)\">613,000 employees</a> and a market capitalization of <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN\">around $800 billion</a>.</p>\n<p>Spot the difference? If you want to build a good business that carves out a profitable niche and provides a good living for you and your employees, then O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s organic growth approach can be the right way to go. But if you want to build a world-changing company, then the massive impact of successful blitzscaling is <em>the</em> technique to use.</p>\n<p>Of course, not everyone is interested in this kind of paradigm-shifting scale. There are some who believe that the past they see in their imaginations was better than today&rsquo;s world, and who want to roll back the clock and minimize change. But we believe that the world is far from perfect, and could use a stiff dose of positive change. Another word for that is progress.</p>\n<p>The ride-hailing market is a perfect illustration of this. O&rsquo;Reilly criticizes Uber and Lyft for unsustainably blitzscaling without creating a profitable business model. In Lyft&rsquo;s recent S-1 filing (the precursor for their upcoming IPO), they even admit that &ldquo;We have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But we&rsquo;re still early in the long game&mdash;and maybe the goal is less profit now in order to earn more profit later. These losses have helped Uber and Lyft transform the transportation market for the better. In New York City, ride-hailing went from being negligible in 2014 to <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/3/15/17126058/uber-lyft-taxis-new-york-city-rides\">over 15 million rides per month</a> by the end of 2017. Over that same time period, taxi rides declined from 15 million rides per month to 10 million rides per month. Blitzscaling transformed this entire industry in about four years, <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w22627.pdf\">and made consumers far better off</a>: Economists from Uber, the University of Chicago, and Oxford estimated that in 2015, Uber generated nearly $7 billion in benefits to consumers in the United States.</p>\n<p>But this is just the beginning. To truly be responsible blitzscalers, Uber and Lyft will need to become sustainable, profitable businesses that make drivers, riders, and their cities better off, not just their shareholders.</p>\n<p>If you believe the future will be better than the past, blitzscaling is heartening, because we&rsquo;ll get there faster.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that most change is difficult, and that even when it&rsquo;s positive overall, it can have negative effects on some. When change occurs at the extreme speed of blitzscaling, it&rsquo;s even harder for those affected to make the necessary adjustments. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s critical that all of us, including the blitzscalers, help society through these transitions. (For example, I [Reid] support <a href=\"http://www.opportunityatwork.org/byron\">Byron Auguste</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.opportunityatwork.org/\">Opportunity@Work</a>, because it is addressing the disruption that blitzscaling can bring by expanding access to career opportunities so that all Americans can work, learn, and earn to their full potential.)</p>\n<p>Blitzscaling is an incredibly powerful social tool. One of the reasons we wrote our book was to make sure that this tool is available to a broad range of responsible blitzscalers, not just those who match the profile that O&rsquo;Reilly describes as the prototypical &ldquo;hyper-aggressive entrepreneur who raised money faster, broke the rules more aggressively, and cut the most corners in the race to the top.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But making the ideas of blitzscaling broadly available isn&rsquo;t enough. As a society, we need to rein in irresponsible blitzscaling while protecting companies that blitzscale for good. The best response to the potential negative fallout of speed and scale is to search for ways to apply guardrails to the highway, not to mourn the loss of local dirt roads. That means the public and private sector need to work together to develop legislation and regulation for new fields like autonomous vehicles and cryptocurrencies, not introduce outright bans.</p>\n<p>Blitzscaling is one of the modern tools for building the technology companies of the future. And <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/\">since all companies are becoming technology companies</a>, and since more markets are becoming <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em> markets, blitzscaling is likely to play an even larger role in the future.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;d like to close with the final words of <em>Blitzscaling</em>, which sum up why we believe blitzscaling has so much potential to make our world better:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you believe the future will be better than the past, blitzscaling is heartening, because we&rsquo;ll get there faster. If you believe that the future will be worse than the past, blitzscaling is terrifying, because it overturns the existing order faster.</p><p>Here is how we personally feel about blitzscaling:</p><p><strong>We believe that the future can and should be better than the past, and that it&rsquo;s worth tolerating the discomfort we feel when blitzscaling to get to the future as quickly as we can.</strong></p><p>We hope to see blitzscaling enable more entrepreneurs to build transformative companies and succeed at a massive scale.</p><p>We hope to see more established companies leveraging the lessons of blitzscaling to be more adaptable and better equipped to tackle the challenges of the future.</p><p>We hope to see activists and governments use the tools of blitzscaling to change the world for the better.</p><p>The companies that choose to blitzscale will soon set the pace of progress in every industry. It&rsquo;s up to you to lead this change&mdash; for yourself, for your company, and for society as a whole.</p><p>Race you to the future.</p></blockquote>",

                "text": "oel Kowsky/NASA via AP\nTim O\u2019Reilly\u2019s recent article, \u201cThe fundamental problem with Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite growth strategy,\u201d makes an impassioned argument that the ideas in our book, Blitzscaling, encourage entrepreneurs to behave in ways that are irresponsible or even dangerous in the pursuit of what he characterizes as \u201crunaway growth.\u201d Instead, he argues for the virtues of going slow and staying small.\nO\u2019Reilly has good intentions, but he\u2019s wrong\u2014both about blitzscaling and in his desire to turn back the clock.\nThere are times when small and slow is the right strategy for a specific market opportunity. But in today\u2019s world, speed-to-scale entrepreneurship is what we need to improve society, transform industries, and create massive value for customers, employees, and investors. That\u2019s what we call \u201cblitzscaling\u201d.\nTake Amazon, for example. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s position resembles that of the ardent bibliophile who bemoans the loss of the corner bookshop. While this stance might seem appealing at first glance, blocking speed and scale for the sake of preserving the past is reactionary and counterproductive. If you broaden your lens to include all stakeholders, Amazon is clearly better for the world.\nCustomers value and benefit from the convenience, price, and selection of Amazon, which is why the company is, by a wide margin, America\u2019s largest bookseller.\nPublishers and authors (like O\u2019Reilly and us) also benefit from Amazon\u2019s success. 2018 set yet another all-time record for the number of paper books sold in the United States, as has been repeatedly true during the era of Amazon.\nAnd from a financial perspective, any investor would be better off buying stock in Amazon than buying and share of a corner bookshop; if you invested $100 in Amazon\u2019s 1997 initial public offering (IPO), those shares would have been worth about $120,000 in 2018.\nFinally, and importantly, society is better off because Amazon makes the system for distributing books (and other products) vastly more productive, freeing up resources for other value-creating investments.\nBlitzscaling is not a reckless gamble; it is a calculated risk.\nBy and large, the only groups that actually prefer the corner bookshop to Amazon are the independent bookstore owners themselves (quite understandably) and those with the luxury of indulging in sentimental nostalgia.\nO\u2019Reilly is not the only one to worry about the negative impact of scaling. Tim Wu\u2019s recent book The Curse of Bigness, for example, argues that unrestrained scale concentrates too much power in too few hands. And, as the industrial revolution showed us, there are some real costs to scale.\nHowever, we believe\u2014ardently and passionately\u2014that responsible scaling is one of the most powerful forces for making people better off, just like the industrial revolution eventually made the world a vastly better place. When the market conditions are right, you should blitzscale for the benefit of all stakeholders: customers, employees, investors, and society.\nOur difference of opinion with O\u2019Reilly boils down to four key points:\nBlitzscaling is a response to market dynamics, not the cause. In a connected world, someone will build an Amazon. The only question is who and how.\nBlitzscaling is a strategic technique for moving faster, not a reckless gamble. Entrepreneurs can and should blitzscale thoughtfully and responsibly.\nYou don\u2019t get to choose whether to have competition, just whether you play to win. Almost no one ever races unopposed.\nYou can\u2014and should\u2014blitzscale responsibly. Speed and scale are generally good for the world; when the outcome is positive, the faster you get there, the better off all stakeholders are.\nTaken together, these points help clarify why we believe in blitzscaling, but should also offer helpful guidance on when to deploy it, and how to shape its effects for good.\nBlitzscaling is a response to market dynamics, not the cause\nOne of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s main criticisms of blitzscaling is that creates a winner-takes-most or winner-takes-all market. In our book, we describe these as Glengarry Glen Ross markets, in which the only truly valuable outcome is winning first prize. In the movie, this was a Cadillac:\n\u201cAs you all know, first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado. Anybody wanna see second prize? Second prize\u2019s a set of steak knives. Third prize is you\u2019re fired.\nO\u2019Reilly describes this as a \u201cdark pattern,\u201d and argues that blitzscaling harmed the market for ride-hailing because \u201cinvestors, awash in cheap capital, anointed the winners rather than letting the market decide who should succeed and who should fail.\u201d\nThis is a fundamental misunderstanding of blitzscaling. Blitzscaling is a response to market dynamics, not their cause. Some markets are Glengarry Glen Ross markets, and some are not. Entrepreneurs and investors can\u2019t transform a normal market into a Glengarry Glen Ross market, regardless of how they might want to do just that.\nWhat makes this tricky is that markets evolve, and an innovative technology or business model can transform a normal market into a Glengarry Glen Ross market. Indeed, many great companies have been built by entrepreneurs who recognized that a technological change transformed the nature of an important market, enabling an innovative, blitzscalable business model. Microsoft and Apple believed that microprocessors would allow consumers to have their own computers. Amazon saw that the internet would change retail. And Apple used the capacitive touch screen to develop a new paradigm for computing.\nNowhere in our book do we recommend that all entrepreneurs blitzscale. In fact, we even have a section titled \u201cCan I Choose Not To Blitzscale?\u201d in which we state that \u201cblitzscaling is not for everyone.\u201d In the same year that Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, Thomas Keller launched The French Laundry restaurant. It\u2019s a great business. It still serves just 60 customers per day.\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s article describes two businesses from his own career at O\u2019Reilly\u2014the Global Network Navigator (GNN) web portal, which he sold to AOL, and the Website web server, which eventually fell by the wayside. O\u2019Reilly argues that both of these were blitzscaling opportunities that he believes O\u2019Reilly was correct to pass on.\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s logic seems self-defeating. Imagine if he did blitzscale GNN and created the equivalent of Google years earlier\u2014the value for society, customers, investors, and employees would be enormous, not to mention for O\u2019Reilly himself.\nIf you want to build a world-changing company, then the massive impact of successful blitzscaling is the technique to use.\nFurthermore, O\u2019Reilly\u2019s own examples demonstrate the difference between a blitzscalable and non-blitzscalable market. Google realized that being the way to find the world\u2019s information was a blitzscalable market, thanks to the network effects in its AdWords revenue engine. If O\u2019Reilly had that same insight in 1995, it could have been an amazing blitzscaling opportunity. Nor would it have required O\u2019Reilly to bet the company; many blitzscaling opportunities perform better as spin-offs or spin-outs. Not only does this protect the parent company and allow raising outside capital to fund growth, but the independence and focus increases the chances of success.\nOn the other hand, web servers are not a blitzscalable market. O\u2019Reilly points out that the Website web server was eclipsed by Netscape, which was in turn crushed by Microsoft\u2014but that victory was short lived. Today, there is no one dominant player in web servers. Like any businesses, Netscape or Microsoft would have wanted web servers to become a Glengarry Glen Ross market, but neither could make that happen, despite their best efforts.\nWhen we look at the broader trends, however, Glengarry Glen Ross markets are increasing. Thanks to the internet and other globalizing technologies, the entire world has entered the Networked Age. Markets for goods, services, and capital (both human and financial) are more liquid and global than ever before, and technology is becoming a core part of every industry. The result is that more and more markets are subject to forces like network effects that tend to produce winner-takes-most dynamics. Bookselling isn\u2019t a winner-takes-most market\u2014but blitzscaling the Kindle platform allowed Amazon to become the runaway leader in what has turned out to be a winner-takes-most market for ebooks (and allowed readers to get instant access to nearly any book they wanted).\nIn other words, it won the Cadillac.\nIf you don\u2019t have the power to change the market dynamics (as is almost always the case), doesn\u2019t it make sense to adopt the techniques that best fit them? Or to put it another way: If you owned a corner bookstore in 1997, would you be better off today if you had invested $10,000 in expanding your physical store\u2014or in the Amazon IPO?\nBlitzscaling is a strategic technique for moving faster, not a reckless gamble\nAnother class of criticisms that O\u2019Reilly levels are based in his belief that blitzscaling is simply a matter of buying growth. For example, O\u2019Reilly writes:\n\u201cIronically, Hoffman and Yeh\u2019s book is full of superb practical advice about innovation, execution, and strategic focus, but it\u2019s wrapped in the flawed promise that start-ups can achieve similar market dominance as these storied companies by force-feeding inefficient growth.\u201d\nElsewhere, O\u2019Reilly asserts that the companies we cite in our book aren\u2019t actually examples of blitzscaling:\n\u201cEach of these companies [Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon] achieved profitability (or in Amazon\u2019s case, positive cash flow) long before its IPO, and growth wasn\u2019t driven by a blitzkrieg of spending to acquire customers below cost, but by breakthrough products and services, and by strategic business model innovations that were rooted in a future that the competition didn\u2019t yet understand. These companies didn\u2019t blitzscale; they scaled sustainably.\u201d\nThe implication is that blitzscaling ignores things like \u201cbusiness model innovations that were rooted in a future that the competition didn\u2019t yet understand\u201d in favor of \u201cspending to acquire customers below cost.\u201d\nThe truth is, we actually agree with O\u2019Reilly about the importance of innovation. In fact, the entire second chapter of Blitzscaling is titled \u201cBusiness Model Innovation,\u201d and focuses on explaining why the simplistic dot-com philosophy of \u201cget big fast\u201d usually doesn\u2019t work. In it we explicitly state:\n\u201cThe real value creation comes when innovative technology enables innovative products and services with innovative business models\u2026.What sets companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook apart, even from other successful high-tech companies, is that they have consistently been able to design and execute business models with characteristics that allow them to quickly achieve massive scale and sustainable competitive advantage.\u201d\nBlitzscaling is not a reckless gamble; it is a calculated risk that should be taken when the market dynamics make it the best strategy to win that market. We define it as the pursuit of rapid growth by prioritizing speed over efficiency in the face of uncertainty, not \u201close money and make it up in volume.\u201d\nEvery successful company\u2019s long-term goal is to build a sustainable business. But sometimes the fastest path to sustainable market leadership involves pursuing a strategy that is unprofitable in the short term in order to reach a position that is more profitable in the long term. In a Glengarry Glen Ross market, the greatest risk is often not taking enough risk, since all the capital efficiency in the world won\u2019t help if a competitor achieves enduring market leadership.\nSometimes the fastest path to sustainable market leadership involves pursuing a strategy that is unprofitable in the short term.\nO\u2019Reilly unwittingly illustrates this point by telling the story of Sunil Paul, a friend and a successful serial entrepreneur who filed a patent on the core elements of GPS-enabled ride-hailing in 2000. The founder of early internet startup Freeloader (acquired for $38 million in 1996) and anti-spam company Brightmail (acquired for $370 million in 2004), Paul went on to pioneer the ride-hailing space. Yet despite literally patenting ride-hailing in 2000, his own venture, Sidecar, lost out to the more aggressive scaling of Uber and Lyft.\nPaul\u2019s track record as a serial entrepreneur was far more impressive than either Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick or Lyft co-founder Logan Green. He also had backing from well-known venture capital investors like Union Square Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Google Ventures, and even Richard Branson. In a vacuum, who wouldn\u2019t bet on the successful multi-millionaire serial entrepreneur with blue-chip backers and a patent on the entire concept of the industry? And yet Uber and Lyft are the market leaders, with a combined 98% of the US market, while Sidecar shut down in 2015.\nThe difference? Uber and Lyft blitzscaled. Sidecar didn\u2019t.\nTo blitzscale successfully, you need a successful business model. But being right isn\u2019t enough, as Paul\u2019s example demonstrates. If you develop a successful business model but don\u2019t scale, someone else will eventually copy that model, scale, and drive you out of business.\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s conclusion is that blitzscaling is bad because it allowed Uber and Lyft to win the ride-hailing market, rather than Paul, the original inventor of the concept. Our conclusion is that Paul\u2019s example demonstrates that while you can build successful companies without blitzscaling (e.g., Freeloader and Brightmail), to win a Glengarry Glen Ross market like ride-hailing, you need a tight focus on speed, regardless of how experienced and qualified the entrepreneur.\nThis begs the billion-dollar question, how can you tell if a market is blitzscalable?\nThe \u201cBusiness Model Innovation\u201d chapter of Blitzscaling provides our answer, by delineating the four key growth factors and two key growth limiters that entrepreneurs and investors can use to assess blitzscalability.\nThe first key growth factor is a big market. Blitzscaling is all about scale, which means a blitzscaling opportunity needs a lot of headroom to grow. For example, Amazon\u2019s market is, well, everything. Plenty of headroom there!\nThe second is distribution\u2014the ability to get product into the hands of customers. If the key to success is achieving critical scale, massive distribution is essential. Dropbox made a great file-sharing product, for instance, but it was their viral marketing campaign that allowed them to cheaply acquire millions of customers.\nThe third is high gross margins. In other words, what percentage of sales are available to pay for growth, and to reward investors for financing that growth. Some blitzscaling companies might deliberately price their products lower, making their actual gross margins significantly less than their potential gross margins. Amazon has done this over and over, even in its highly profitable Amazon Web Service business. But this should be viewed as a temporary tactic, not a long-term sustainable business model.\nThe fourth are network effects (or some other source of long-term competitive advantage). Network effects occur when each new node you add to a network (say, each new home that\u2019s added to Airbnb) increases the value of that network to the other nodes. Businesses with strong network effects such as eBay (which has networks of both buyers and sellers) can build enduring market leadership that lasts years or even decades.\nBut possessing the key growth factors is not enough to make a company blitzscalable, because the presence of the growth limiters can block sustainable growth. There are two main hurdles that need to be considered.\nThe first key growth limiter is a lack of product-market fit. Product-market fit, as defined by Stanford\u2019s Steve Blank, occurs when a product\u2019s features are a strong fit with its market\u2019s needs, as measured by a combination of usage, retention, and sales. Companies like Groupon that grow rapidly, but whose core products are not compelling to customers, can\u2019t successfully blitzscale because they can\u2019t retain those customers long enough to build long-term value.\nThe second is a lack of operational scalability. There is no such thing as a company that generates billions of dollars of revenue with a team of less than 10 people. Blitzscaling requires building a substantial organization at an abnormally rapid pace. Traditional companies might grow 10% per year; blitzscaling companies might grow 10% per month or even per week.\nSunil Paul\u2019s company Brightmail is a great example of a good business that wasn\u2019t blitzscalable. Brightmail did well on distribution, where it struck up partnerships with many leading internet service providers (ISPs), and also had decent gross margins. But it lacked the requisite market size and network effects to be a blitzscaling opportunity: The market for spam-filtering technology was limited to a relatively small group of ISPs and therefore didn\u2019t represent a multibillion-dollar opportunity.\nBlitzscaling works when being the first company to achieve critical scale produces enduring leadership in a massively valuable market. When those conditions aren\u2019t met, attempting to blitzscale is simply a good way to waste your time and energy\u2014and investor capital.\nYou don\u2019t get to choose whether to have competition, just whether you play to win\nIn his piece, O\u2019Reilly defines an implicit distinction between what he characterizes as organic and inorganic market development. He writes of the ride-hailing market:\n\u201cWould a market that grew more organically\u2014like the web, e-commerce, smartphones, or mobile mapping services\u2014have created more value over the long term?\u201d\nIronically, these four markets are, in fact, the province of blitzscalers. Google\u2019s Chrome is the preeminent web browser, Amazon is the preeminent e-commerce option, Google and Apple are the leaders in smartphone operating systems (except in China, where Chinese blitzscalers like Xiaomi hold sway), and Google operates the leading mobile mapping services.\nAs an individual entrepreneur, you might prefer a world without competition, but the rest of the world is better off when competition occurs. Competition drives better products and services, lower prices, and people taking risks to innovate. But it also means that people have to compete, which may feel stressful and force you out of your comfort zone. It may not seem fair, but if you choose not to compete for leadership in a Glengarry Glen Ross market, you\u2019re choosing to lose.\nIn the book, we detail the story of how Airbnb responded when Rocket Internet, an internet-venture builder founded by the German Samwer brothers, created a European clone of the service called Wimdu. Airbnb was a small 40-person company at the time, and Wimdu, raised close to $100 million, hired 400 employees, and opened 20 offices. Then Rocket Internet offered to sell Wimdu to Airbnb for a 25% stake in Airbnb. (I [Reid] remember when Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky told me about the offer.)\nWhen you\u2019re forced to outsprint a capable competitor, you can achieve your goals more quickly than you ever imagined.\nGroupon\u2019s co-founder and then-CEO Andrew Mason advised Brian to take the deal. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably kill you,\u201d he said.\nDo you think Airbnb wanted that kind of competition? Of course not. But unless Airbnb agreed to a merger, it had only two options. One, it could rise to the challenge and compete by launching its own blitzscaling effort. Or two, it could insist on \u201corganic\u201d growth and lose, thus fulfilling Mason\u2019s prediction.\nAirbnb chose to compete, raising its own war chest of $112 million and opening nine offices around the world in less than a year. It was stressful and uncomfortable, but it worked. Airbnb\u2019s bookings increased by a factor of 10 during that time, and it left Wimdu in the rear-view mirror. In 2018, Wimdu shut down, while a now-profitable Airbnb was one of the world\u2019s most valuable startups.\n\u201cThe Samwers gave us a gift,\u201d Chesky admitted many years later in the Blitzscaling class we taught at Stanford University in 2015. \u201cThey forced us to scale faster than we ever would have.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the upside of competition. When you\u2019re forced to outsprint a capable competitor, you can achieve your goals more quickly than you ever imagined, creating more value than you ever imagined\u2014and not just for the founders and employees, but for customers and other stakeholders, too.\nYou can\u2014and should\u2014blitzscale responsibly\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s final criticism centers around his belief that what he calls \u201crunaway growth\u201d is bad for the world. O\u2019Reilly erroneously believes that Blitzscaling ignores the question of responsibility. He writes:\nI\u2019ve talked so far mainly about the investment distortions that blitzscaling introduces. But there is another point that I wish Hoffman and Yeh had made in their book.\nAssume for a moment that blitzscaling is indeed a recipe for companies to achieve the kind of market dominance that has been achieved by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google. Assume that technology is often a winner-takes-all market, and that blitzscaling is indeed a powerful tool in the arsenal of those in pursuit of the win.\nWhat is the responsibility of the winners? And what happens to those who don\u2019t win?\nWe stand with O\u2019Reilly in this call for responsible scaling. We completely agree that the blitzscalers who win their markets have a moral obligation to those markets and their associated stakeholders. That is precisely why we leave the reader with this message in the final chapter in the book, \u201cResponsible Blitzscaling.\u201d\nThis passage from that chapter speaks directly to the need for responsibility, both morally and practically:\n\u201cWe believe that the responsibilities of a blitzscaler go beyond simply maximizing shareholder value while obeying the law; you are also responsible for how the actions of your business impact the larger society. But even beyond the moral imperatives, responsible blitzscaling is good business strategy. Society provides the ecosystem in which you live, and in which your businesses operate, which means that it can rightly claim some responsibility for your success. In other words, your success is contingent upon society functioning properly. Here in Silicon Valley, some might fantasize about floating cities in international waters, but the fact is that our successes rely on the rule of law, robust financial markets, and an education system that produces talented employees and a healthy market of consumers.\u201d\nTo ensure that this concept spreads as broadly as possible, we are publishing the chapter on responsible blitzscaling in full so that even those who don\u2019t have the book can freely access it. You can find it here.\nTo blitzscale, or not to blitzscale?\nThere are many legitimate reasons not to blitzscale.\nTo start with, the chance of failure is high\u2014as it is for any startup. As O\u2019Reilly points out, the venture-capital model is a \u201chome run\u201d model, where most investments fail and the massive scale and impact of the few successes makes the model work. This means that the chance of success for any individual entrepreneur, even those who are blitzscaling, is small.\nThus, if your main goal is to operate a successful business for decades (or even generations), provide good products to your customers, and make a good living for you and your employees, then you should follow O\u2019Reilly\u2019s advice. That is a laudable and time-honored achievement.\nO\u2019Reilly cites a number of these successfully bootstrapped businesses in his piece, including Mailchimp, Atlassian, Shutterstock, Basecamp, and RXBAR. All of these are great businesses with happy customers. All of their founders and employees have done well. Combined, they have under 8,000 employees (as measured on LinkedIn), and a market capitalization of just about $30 billion.\nGreat numbers, to be sure\u2014but Amazon alone has 613,000 employees and a market capitalization of around $800 billion.\nSpot the difference? If you want to build a good business that carves out a profitable niche and provides a good living for you and your employees, then O\u2019Reilly\u2019s organic growth approach can be the right way to go. But if you want to build a world-changing company, then the massive impact of successful blitzscaling is the technique to use.\nOf course, not everyone is interested in this kind of paradigm-shifting scale. There are some who believe that the past they see in their imaginations was better than today\u2019s world, and who want to roll back the clock and minimize change. But we believe that the world is far from perfect, and could use a stiff dose of positive change. Another word for that is progress.\nThe ride-hailing market is a perfect illustration of this. O\u2019Reilly criticizes Uber and Lyft for unsustainably blitzscaling without creating a profitable business model. In Lyft\u2019s recent S-1 filing (the precursor for their upcoming IPO), they even admit that \u201cWe have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\u201d\nBut we\u2019re still early in the long game\u2014and maybe the goal is less profit now in order to earn more profit later. These losses have helped Uber and Lyft transform the transportation market for the better. In New York City, ride-hailing went from being negligible in 2014 to over 15 million rides per month by the end of 2017. Over that same time period, taxi rides declined from 15 million rides per month to 10 million rides per month. Blitzscaling transformed this entire industry in about four years, and made consumers far better off: Economists from Uber, the University of Chicago, and Oxford estimated that in 2015, Uber generated nearly $7 billion in benefits to consumers in the United States.\nBut this is just the beginning. To truly be responsible blitzscalers, Uber and Lyft will need to become sustainable, profitable businesses that make drivers, riders, and their cities better off, not just their shareholders.\nIf you believe the future will be better than the past, blitzscaling is heartening, because we\u2019ll get there faster.\nWe acknowledge that most change is difficult, and that even when it\u2019s positive overall, it can have negative effects on some. When change occurs at the extreme speed of blitzscaling, it\u2019s even harder for those affected to make the necessary adjustments. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical that all of us, including the blitzscalers, help society through these transitions. (For example, I [Reid] support Byron Auguste\u2019s Opportunity@Work, because it is addressing the disruption that blitzscaling can bring by expanding access to career opportunities so that all Americans can work, learn, and earn to their full potential.)\nBlitzscaling is an incredibly powerful social tool. One of the reasons we wrote our book was to make sure that this tool is available to a broad range of responsible blitzscalers, not just those who match the profile that O\u2019Reilly describes as the prototypical \u201chyper-aggressive entrepreneur who raised money faster, broke the rules more aggressively, and cut the most corners in the race to the top.\u201d\nBut making the ideas of blitzscaling broadly available isn\u2019t enough. As a society, we need to rein in irresponsible blitzscaling while protecting companies that blitzscale for good. The best response to the potential negative fallout of speed and scale is to search for ways to apply guardrails to the highway, not to mourn the loss of local dirt roads. That means the public and private sector need to work together to develop legislation and regulation for new fields like autonomous vehicles and cryptocurrencies, not introduce outright bans.\nBlitzscaling is one of the modern tools for building the technology companies of the future. And since all companies are becoming technology companies, and since more markets are becoming Glengarry Glen Ross markets, blitzscaling is likely to play an even larger role in the future.\nWe\u2019d like to close with the final words of Blitzscaling, which sum up why we believe blitzscaling has so much potential to make our world better:\nIf you believe the future will be better than the past, blitzscaling is heartening, because we\u2019ll get there faster. If you believe that the future will be worse than the past, blitzscaling is terrifying, because it overturns the existing order faster.\nHere is how we personally feel about blitzscaling:\nWe believe that the future can and should be better than the past, and that it\u2019s worth tolerating the discomfort we feel when blitzscaling to get to the future as quickly as we can.\nWe hope to see blitzscaling enable more entrepreneurs to build transformative companies and succeed at a massive scale.\nWe hope to see more established companies leveraging the lessons of blitzscaling to be more adaptable and better equipped to tackle the challenges of the future.\nWe hope to see activists and governments use the tools of blitzscaling to change the world for the better.\nThe companies that choose to blitzscale will soon set the pace of progress in every industry. It\u2019s up to you to lead this change\u2014 for yourself, for your company, and for society as a whole.\nRace you to the future.",

She is autistic, and as a child, did not have any friends. When she moved from the country to the city, not much changed. &ldquo;They says it&rsquo;s a phase, but a phase becomes a life,&rdquo; she says, surrounded by six other young adults in a cozy apartment in Copenhagen&mdash;all of whom are working on becoming less lonely.</p>\n<p>Toad is among the attendees of <a href=\"https://ventilen.dk/\">Ventilen</a>, or &ldquo;friend to one&rdquo; in Danish, a 20-year-old organization set up to bring 15-to-25-year-olds together twice a week with two or three volunteers. Together, the people in the group play games, make meals, go to the cinema, and build the human connections that many feel they lack.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I try to fight my depression by being less lonely, not with medicine,&rdquo; Toad says.</p>\n<p>Christian, who is 23, says he too suffered in high school. Though he had two friends with whom he spoke regularly, he rarely saw them in person. He tried anti-anxiety medicine, but coming off it was hard. Then his aunt found Ventilen on Facebook and recommended he try it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s helped me to open up,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel lonely the same way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ventilen currently offers 21 venues in Denmark where young people looking for companionship can meet one another. There are 15 gathering places for people aged 15-25, and six KOMsammen, or &ldquo;Fit for Friendship&rdquo; places, which focus on food and movement for those aged 15-30. The essential services its venues offer are straightforward, and yet can be so elusive: a place to go, things to do, and people to do them with.</p>\n<p>While Ventilen has been around for decades, its simple yet novel approach is getting more attention as <a href=\"https://qz.com/1413576/loneliness-is-bad-for-our-health-now-governments-around-the-world-are-finally-tackling-the-problem/\">governments everywhere</a> wake up to the prevalence, and cost, of loneliness. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/report-section/loneliness-and-social-isolation-in-the-united-states-the-united-kingdom-and-japan-an-international-survey-introduction/\">study showed</a> that 22% of Americans, 23% of Brits and 9% of Japanese adults said they felt lonely all the time. When the<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2yzhfv4DvqVp5nZyxBD8G23/who-feels-lonely-the-results-of-the-world-s-largest-loneliness-study\"> BBC asked 55,000</a> people about their experiences with loneliness,<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2yzhfv4DvqVp5nZyxBD8G23/who-feels-lonely-the-results-of-the-world-s-largest-loneliness-study\">33% of respondents</a> said they were &ldquo;often&rdquo; or &ldquo;very often&rdquo; lonely. Among those aged 16-24, the figure was a shocking 40%.</p>\n<p>Vivek Murthy, the former US surgeon general, has declared loneliness an &ldquo;epidemic,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://qz.com/1420602/feeling-lonely-vivek-murthy-says-to-get-out-of-your-head-and-help-someone-else/\">noting that</a> it was dangerous both in its own right and because of its links to deep societal problems such as addiction and violence: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s prevalent, it&rsquo;s common, and the studies Julianne [Holt-Lunstad] and others have done have shown a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/well/mind/how-loneliness-affects-our-health.html\">robust association with illnesses</a> that we actually care about, including heart disease, dementia, depression and anxiety, and very importantly, longevity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316\">Indeed, Holt-Lunstad&rsquo;s research</a> shows that being disconnected poses comparable danger to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and is more predictive of early death than the effects of air pollution or physical inactivity.</p>\n<h2>Finding a common purpose</h2>\n<p>According to Julie Vorsaa, volunteer coordinator for Ventilen, the idea for the organization can be traced back to 1999, when two volunteers (whose names no one remembers) were working for a help line. They noticed a lot of people weren&rsquo;t as much in need of help as they were in need of friends. They were lonely, and the help line could only be a band-aid, not a cure. They formed a support group called Bright Point, aimed at facilitating IRL conversation. But when people came together, no one talked. The idea seemed destined to fail.</p>\n<p>Then someone had the idea of introducing games. &ldquo;They had a catalyst, and they started to talk over the game,&rdquo; she says. Later, the group added the idea of making meals, and then exercising. &ldquo;They found out food was a good thing to bring people together,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You talk when you eat. It&rsquo;s more cozy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Since 2011, Ventilen, which gets funding from the government and private donors, has been measuring its results. Through 2017, nearly 700 people had participated in Ventilen (55.7% men, 44.3% women), with the average age being 20.9. According to its self-reported survey, 70% of participants said they felt less lonely after coming, while 74% reported higher self-worth after coming. Sixty-four percent said they were better at social situations, and 80% said they were more likely to meet other people.</p>\n<p>About one in 10 young people in Denmark report <a href=\"https://ventilen.dk/om-ensomhed/\">that they are lonely. </a>While this may seem surprising in a country that is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.co.za/why-denmark-is-one-of-the-happiest-countries-in-the-world-2018-12\">frequently rated</a> one of the happiest in the world, it mirrors data from around the world showing a spike in loneliness among the young as well as the old.</p>\n<p>While some argue <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/opinion/sunday/loneliness-health.html\">there is no new crisis of loneliness</a>, Murthy says a few things are contributing to raised awareness of the problem. More people are talking about it, creating a snowball effect, while research is showing its ill effects on health and well-being. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not new&mdash;people have been lonely for hundreds of years,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I think the fact that it is an almost universal experience makes it easier for people to be open to thinking about it, even if they don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The program is not without challenges. Many lonely people may be too intimidated to come to a venue; some who come won&rsquo;t return. But designating a space for gathering and having activities to bring people together is an effective way to tackle loneliness, says Claire O&rsquo;Shea, a campaign manager for the UK&rsquo;s Campaign to end Loneliness. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just bring a roomful people together, you have to find a common purpose,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It takes the pressure off finding something to say, and that&rsquo;s talking about the moment, or the activity.&rdquo; She cites <a href=\"https://menssheds.org.uk/about/what-is-a-mens-shed/mens-sheds-faq/\">Men&rsquo;s Sheds</a>, an organization that promotes community spaces for men to &ldquo;connect, converse and create.&rdquo; They gather in areas&mdash;empty offices, portable cabin&rsquo;s, warehouses, garages, and in one case, an out-of-use mortuary&mdash;to do things like woodworking, metalworking, and repairing and restoring things. They&rsquo;re also there to be together.</p>\n<p>Because as anyone knows, you can be in a room filled with people or a city and be plenty lonely.</p>\n<h2>Opening up</h2>\n<p>When I first ask to go to a Ventilen in Copenhagen, Vorsaa tells me it will not be possible. Privacy is paramount, and the individuals themselves do not even register their names. (They give their gender, age, and whether they are employed and/or in school.) &ldquo;It is a safe space,&rdquo; she explains. It can be very hard to realize you are lonely, and even harder to admit it because of the social stigma. More people will come if they do not have to give personal information.</p>\n<p>But when we meet in the Ventilen offices, a volunteer reports that a group is happy to speak with me. We bike over to N&oslash;rrebro, one of Copenhagen&rsquo;s most diverse neighborhoods, to a comfortable apartment with a small kitchen and eating area, as well as a sitting room with a coffee table. The group has already shopped for lunch and cooked it together before sitting down for games.</p>\n<p>Some are clearly shy, but open up gradually to paint painful portraits of what it&rsquo;s like to feel very alone. Tuned in to a hyperconnected world via social media and gaming, they report wanting the friends and connections they see but feeling that such relationships are out of reach, for reasons varying from chronic pain to video game addiction, social anxiety, and a pervasive sense that they simply do not have the muscles to form social bonds.</p>\n<p>Simone, 20, says she has been depressed since she was 10. &ldquo;I am used to it,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst part.&rdquo; When her two best friends moved away, she explains while crying, she reverted to a life of only working and sleeping. She developed chronic pain because she did not move enough. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to leave my home because I didn&rsquo;t need to, and everyone was very busy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A nurse at a pain clinic told her about Ventilen and she decided to try it. It&rsquo;s been positive for her, she says, in part because being more active means she&rsquo;s not in as much pain. She still takes anti-depressants, and still has severe social anxiety, she says. &ldquo;My heart is racing just talking to you.&rdquo; But she enjoys coming. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a reason not to go home and go to bed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The group is not designed to address addiction or severe mental illness, and screens participants accordingly. &ldquo;We see a lot of people with mental illness and it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; says Vorsaa. &ldquo;But if the mental illness overshadows the group, if it&rsquo;s too big, it&rsquo;s not the place.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>New participants come half an hour before their first group session to meet with a volunteer who makes sure the person is a good fit for the group. They pay for their own meals, since being part of a group means paying your own way.</p>\n<p>Kasper, who wears glasses and is slight, has suffered with depression and anxiety. High school was very isolating, he says, and he took a break afterward. But he found he lacked the skills he needed to help himself. &ldquo;In my life I had chosen to be so isolated so I didn&rsquo;t know how to communicate.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He spent a lot of time online, which he says made everything worse. &ldquo;I think it gets worse with the internet,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We always look at the perfect picture on the internet.&rdquo; Being part of a group through Ventilen has helped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made some good friendships,&rdquo; he says thoughtfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been good for me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In addition to the groups, Ventilen is now working in 43 schools to train high-school teachers about how to be more supportive of students. &ldquo;Young people hate going to school,&rdquo; says Vorsaa. Many feel constantly left out, particularly since so much high-school work is done in groups. Students voice anxiety about being the last to be picked, or feeling that others are being forced to work with them.</p>\n<p>They feel &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a game of musical chairs and they will lose every time,&rdquo; she explains.</p>\n<p>Having a place to go and people to see outside of school offers a reminder that they needn&rsquo;t always feel that way. &ldquo;What I find profoundly empowering about addressing loneliness is that the ultimate solution to loneliness lies in each of us,&rdquo; Murthy says. &ldquo;We can be the medicine that each other needs.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Giving young people a room of their own, and something to do in it, is a good way to get that started.</p>",

                "text": "Ventilen\nToad, a 20-year-old Danish woman living in Copenhagen, has been lonely her whole life. She is autistic, and as a child, did not have any friends. When she moved from the country to the city, not much changed. \u201cThey says it\u2019s a phase, but a phase becomes a life,\u201d she says, surrounded by six other young adults in a cozy apartment in Copenhagen\u2014all of whom are working on becoming less lonely.\nToad is among the attendees of Ventilen, or \u201cfriend to one\u201d in Danish, a 20-year-old organization set up to bring 15-to-25-year-olds together twice a week with two or three volunteers. Together, the people in the group play games, make meals, go to the cinema, and build the human connections that many feel they lack.\n\u201cI try to fight my depression by being less lonely, not with medicine,\u201d Toad says.\nChristian, who is 23, says he too suffered in high school. Though he had two friends with whom he spoke regularly, he rarely saw them in person. He tried anti-anxiety medicine, but coming off it was hard. Then his aunt found Ventilen on Facebook and recommended he try it. \u201cIt\u2019s helped me to open up,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel lonely the same way.\u201d\nVentilen currently offers 21 venues in Denmark where young people looking for companionship can meet one another. There are 15 gathering places for people aged 15-25, and six KOMsammen, or \u201cFit for Friendship\u201d places, which focus on food and movement for those aged 15-30. The essential services its venues offer are straightforward, and yet can be so elusive: a place to go, things to do, and people to do them with.\nWhile Ventilen has been around for decades, its simple yet novel approach is getting more attention as governments everywhere wake up to the prevalence, and cost, of loneliness. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation study showed that 22% of Americans, 23% of Brits and 9% of Japanese adults said they felt lonely all the time. When the BBC asked 55,000 people about their experiences with loneliness,33% of respondents said they were \u201coften\u201d or \u201cvery often\u201d lonely. Among those aged 16-24, the figure was a shocking 40%.\nVivek Murthy, the former US surgeon general, has declared loneliness an \u201cepidemic,\u201d noting that it was dangerous both in its own right and because of its links to deep societal problems such as addiction and violence: \u201cIt\u2019s prevalent, it\u2019s common, and the studies Julianne [Holt-Lunstad] and others have done have shown a robust association with illnesses that we actually care about, including heart disease, dementia, depression and anxiety, and very importantly, longevity.\u201d\nIndeed, Holt-Lunstad\u2019s research shows that being disconnected poses comparable danger to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and is more predictive of early death than the effects of air pollution or physical inactivity.\nFinding a common purpose\nAccording to Julie Vorsaa, volunteer coordinator for Ventilen, the idea for the organization can be traced back to 1999, when two volunteers (whose names no one remembers) were working for a help line. They noticed a lot of people weren\u2019t as much in need of help as they were in need of friends. They were lonely, and the help line could only be a band-aid, not a cure. They formed a support group called Bright Point, aimed at facilitating IRL conversation. But when people came together, no one talked. The idea seemed destined to fail.\nThen someone had the idea of introducing games. \u201cThey had a catalyst, and they started to talk over the game,\u201d she says. Later, the group added the idea of making meals, and then exercising. \u201cThey found out food was a good thing to bring people together,\u201d she says. \u201cYou talk when you eat. It\u2019s more cozy.\u201d\nSince 2011, Ventilen, which gets funding from the government and private donors, has been measuring its results. Through 2017, nearly 700 people had participated in Ventilen (55.7% men, 44.3% women), with the average age being 20.9. According to its self-reported survey, 70% of participants said they felt less lonely after coming, while 74% reported higher self-worth after coming. Sixty-four percent said they were better at social situations, and 80% said they were more likely to meet other people.\nAbout one in 10 young people in Denmark report that they are lonely. While this may seem surprising in a country that is frequently rated one of the happiest in the world, it mirrors data from around the world showing a spike in loneliness among the young as well as the old.\nWhile some argue there is no new crisis of loneliness, Murthy says a few things are contributing to raised awareness of the problem. More people are talking about it, creating a snowball effect, while research is showing its ill effects on health and well-being. \u201cIt\u2019s not new\u2014people have been lonely for hundreds of years,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think the fact that it is an almost universal experience makes it easier for people to be open to thinking about it, even if they don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\nThe program is not without challenges. Many lonely people may be too intimidated to come to a venue; some who come won\u2019t return. But designating a space for gathering and having activities to bring people together is an effective way to tackle loneliness, says Claire O\u2019Shea, a campaign manager for the UK\u2019s Campaign to end Loneliness. \u201cYou can\u2019t just bring a roomful people together, you have to find a common purpose,\u201d she says. \u201cIt takes the pressure off finding something to say, and that\u2019s talking about the moment, or the activity.\u201d She cites Men\u2019s Sheds, an organization that promotes community spaces for men to \u201cconnect, converse and create.\u201d They gather in areas\u2014empty offices, portable cabin\u2019s, warehouses, garages, and in one case, an out-of-use mortuary\u2014to do things like woodworking, metalworking, and repairing and restoring things. They\u2019re also there to be together.\nBecause as anyone knows, you can be in a room filled with people or a city and be plenty lonely.\nOpening up\nWhen I first ask to go to a Ventilen in Copenhagen, Vorsaa tells me it will not be possible. Privacy is paramount, and the individuals themselves do not even register their names. (They give their gender, age, and whether they are employed and/or in school.) \u201cIt is a safe space,\u201d she explains. It can be very hard to realize you are lonely, and even harder to admit it because of the social stigma. More people will come if they do not have to give personal information.\nBut when we meet in the Ventilen offices, a volunteer reports that a group is happy to speak with me. We bike over to N\u00f8rrebro, one of Copenhagen\u2019s most diverse neighborhoods, to a comfortable apartment with a small kitchen and eating area, as well as a sitting room with a coffee table. The group has already shopped for lunch and cooked it together before sitting down for games.\nSome are clearly shy, but open up gradually to paint painful portraits of what it\u2019s like to feel very alone. Tuned in to a hyperconnected world via social media and gaming, they report wanting the friends and connections they see but feeling that such relationships are out of reach, for reasons varying from chronic pain to video game addiction, social anxiety, and a pervasive sense that they simply do not have the muscles to form social bonds.\nSimone, 20, says she has been depressed since she was 10. \u201cI am used to it,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst part.\u201d When her two best friends moved away, she explains while crying, she reverted to a life of only working and sleeping. She developed chronic pain because she did not move enough. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave my home because I didn\u2019t need to, and everyone was very busy.\u201d\nA nurse at a pain clinic told her about Ventilen and she decided to try it. It\u2019s been positive for her, she says, in part because being more active means she\u2019s not in as much pain. She still takes anti-depressants, and still has severe social anxiety, she says. \u201cMy heart is racing just talking to you.\u201d But she enjoys coming. \u201cIt\u2019s a reason not to go home and go to bed.\u201d\nThe group is not designed to address addiction or severe mental illness, and screens participants accordingly. \u201cWe see a lot of people with mental illness and it\u2019s fine,\u201d says Vorsaa. \u201cBut if the mental illness overshadows the group, if it\u2019s too big, it\u2019s not the place.\u201d\nNew participants come half an hour before their first group session to meet with a volunteer who makes sure the person is a good fit for the group. They pay for their own meals, since being part of a group means paying your own way.\nKasper, who wears glasses and is slight, has suffered with depression and anxiety. High school was very isolating, he says, and he took a break afterward. But he found he lacked the skills he needed to help himself. \u201cIn my life I had chosen to be so isolated so I didn\u2019t know how to communicate.\u201d\nHe spent a lot of time online, which he says made everything worse. \u201cI think it gets worse with the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe always look at the perfect picture on the internet.\u201d Being part of a group through Ventilen has helped. \u201cI\u2019ve made some good friendships,\u201d he says thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s been good for me.\u201d\nIn addition to the groups, Ventilen is now working in 43 schools to train high-school teachers about how to be more supportive of students. \u201cYoung people hate going to school,\u201d says Vorsaa. Many feel constantly left out, particularly since so much high-school work is done in groups. Students voice anxiety about being the last to be picked, or feeling that others are being forced to work with them.\nThey feel \u201cit\u2019s a game of musical chairs and they will lose every time,\u201d she explains.\nHaving a place to go and people to see outside of school offers a reminder that they needn\u2019t always feel that way. \u201cWhat I find profoundly empowering about addressing loneliness is that the ultimate solution to loneliness lies in each of us,\u201d Murthy says. \u201cWe can be the medicine that each other needs.\u201d\nGiving young people a room of their own, and something to do in it, is a good way to get that started.",

                "text": "AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin\nOn Ivanka Trump\u2019s first official visit to Africa, there have been no colonial-era helmets or Trump-style gaffes\u2014just business.\nThe daughter and adviser of president Trump has spent the past three days visiting Ethiopia and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire as she promotes the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity program, an initiative to support women across developing countries. The fund\u2019s big-picture goal is to empower 50 million women across developing countries over the next six years and is in line with Ivanka Trump\u2019s self-branding as a women\u2019s empowerment advocate as she continues to build an international and diplomatic profile.\nIn comparison, Melania Trump\u2019s trip last October, which left many confused as to the purpose and intended audience of her trip, was marked by her colonial-style fashion choices.\nFor her part, Ivanka Trump has avoided controversial fashion picks and has spent much of her time in high-powered meetings. While in Ethiopia, where she met the country\u2019s first female president Sahle-Work Zewde, Trump announced the launch of 2X Africa, a $350 million initiative to support investment in women in Africa in partnership with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the U.S. Government\u2019s development finance institution. The initiative has been launched, Ivanka Trump says, \u201cto directly invest capital into supporting women-owned, women-led, and women-supporting projects in Sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\nReinforcing the business theme of her visit, Trump also met with private sector businesswomen who form part of Ethiopia\u2019s $860 million coffee industry.\nIn C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ivanka Trump met with vice president Daniel Kablan Duncan and other government officials at the Presidential Palace where she discussed removing legal and cultural barriers to women\u2019s economic empowerment in the West African country. And for its part, the Ivorian government talked up its commitment to improving on women empowerment indicators, including girls\u2019 education.\nJust like first lady Melania\u2019s, Ivanka Trump\u2019s genial demeanor and rhetoric has seemed at odds with president Trump\u2019s Africa-related actions since becoming president. His now infamous comment about \u201cshithole countries\u201d aside, the United States\u2019 Africa policy has appeared in a state of flux under the Trump administration\u2014a reality that could have been predicted given the administration\u2019s skepticism even before the president was sworn in.\nAfrican countries have also been hit hard by Trump\u2019s tough stance on immigration with the latest measure reportedly being possible visa bans for countries whose nationals overstay their short-term visas. While that measure is being debated however, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Eritrea and most recently Ghana have already been issued visa restrictions for failing to or delaying accepting their nationals ordered removed from the United States.\nTrump\u2019s \u201ctrade wars,\u201d mainly dominated by high-profile tussles with powerhouses like China, has also claimed an African casualty: as a response to Rwanda\u2019s raised tariffs on second-hand clothes imported from the US, the Trump administration suspended Rwanda\u2019s privilege to export duty-free clothing to the United States last July.\nSign up to the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief here for news and analysis on African business, tech and innovation in your inbox",

                "text": "Reuters/Adnan Abidi\nThis post was updated on April 17.\nThe past year has been a harrowing one for India\u2019s oldest private airline, Jet Airways.\nThe carrier has been in the red for several quarters. Its founder Naresh Goyal had to give up the reins last month after lenders took charge of the organisation. The Mumbai-based carrier has now run out of money to continue operations, it said in a statement today (April 17).\nHere\u2019s a look at everything that\u2019s gone wrong with India\u2019s second-largest carrier by market share in the last year:\nMarch 2018\nJet Airways reports a loss of Rs1,036 crore in the Jan-March quarter as revenue declines and costs increase significantly. The company defers the March salaries of some employees citing \u201ccircumstances beyond its control.\u201d\nMay 2018\nThe government refuses to approve Jet\u2019s merger with its subsidiary JetLite, nearly three years after the proposal was made.\nJune 2018\nJet announces new check-in baggage norms. The 15kg of free check-in luggage for economy class will have to be in one bag. Business class passengers can carry 30kg in two bags.\nAugust 2018\nOn Aug. 12, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation announces an audit to assess Jet\u2019s financial health. State Bank of India asks the firm to provide enough collateral for emergency funding.\nSeptember 2018\nOn Sep.19, the income-tax department conducts surveys in the company\u2019s Mumbai and Delhi offices over allegations of financial misappropriation.\nSeptember 2018\nThe next day (Sep. 20), around 30 passengers on a Jet Airways flight from Mumbai to Jaipur suffer nose and ear bleeding after the cabin crew forgets to activate the internal pressure control. India\u2019s civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu orders a safety audit of all airlines and airports.",

But our thirst for retellings of the story of the doomed company, and its founder, Elizabeth Holmes, seems inexhaustible. Yesterday (Mar. 18), we got another one: HBO&rsquo;s two-hour documentary, <a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/the-inventor-out-for-blood-in-silicon-valley\"><em>The Inventor</em>.</a></p>\n<p>For those already well acquainted with the story, the documentary offers little in terms of new facts. But more than in other tellings, <em>The Inventor </em>works to explain the public&rsquo;s willingness to believe a woman in tech if she&rsquo;s captivating in a certain way, and to find a particular kind of glee in her downfall.</p>\n<p>The plot points of <em>The Inventor</em> don&rsquo;t stray too far from John Carreyrou&rsquo;s<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901?ns=prod/accounts-wsj\"> reporting</a> for the Wall Street Journal, or his 2018 book<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X\"> <em>Bad Blood</em></a>, or the recent ABC podcast &ldquo;<a href=\"http://abcradio.com/podcasts/the-dropout/\">The Dropout.</a>&rdquo; Elizabeth Holmes was 19 when she dropped out of Stanford. Armed with a compelling narrative about a lifelong fear of needles and a dear uncle&rsquo;s early demise that could have been prevented with early diagnosis, Holmes launched Theranos to develop novel technology that would detect diseases from just a pinprick of blood. She was able to secure noteworthy public figures as board members and investors, and even a few large partnership deals, notably one with Walgreens, which offered the drug store&rsquo;s customers a menu of 200 blood tests, all available without prescription. But the Edison, Theranos&rsquo; &ldquo;microfluidity&rdquo; blood-testing device, never actually worked. Lab techs at the company&rsquo;s headquarters either fudged results by using blood-testing machines built by other manufacturers, or sent faulty ones back to patients.</p>\n<p>Thanks to whistleblowers and Carreyrou&rsquo;s dogged investigative reporting, the fraud perpetrated by Holmes and company president/COO (and Holmes&rsquo; then-boyfriend) Ramesh &ldquo;Sunny&rdquo; Balwani, was made public. The company was sanctioned by government regulators, lost its Walgreens contract, and was sued; Holmes and Balwani were found guilty of massive fraud, and Theranos shut down.</p>\n<p>Both the podcast and the HBO documentary include interviews with the whistleblowers: Tyler Shultz (the grandson of former secretary of state George Shultz, who sat on Theranos&rsquo; board and was close to Holmes) and Erika Cheung (who worked as a lab associate at Theranos before alerting regulators to the company&rsquo;s sketchy practices).</p>\n<p>Their perspectives help explain the cult of personality that developed around Holmes and her infectious idealism. &ldquo;It was hard to really get a sense of who she was. But in a way I idolized her, based on the little I had read&mdash;for being a woman in the sciences, being a woman in tech, the fact that she started her own company&mdash;that really got me excited,&rdquo; says Cheung in the documentary. &ldquo;She was a really good idol to have. In a sense I was super na&iuml;ve and drank the Kool-aid a little too quickly and was more enthusiastic to be a part of the team.&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Silicon Valley suffers from a dearth of female leaders, especially those who&rsquo;ve invented their own technology and founded their own companies. In 2017, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/19/in-2017-only-17-of-startups-have-a-female-founder/\">17%</a> of US-based startups had female founders, and they brought in about<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/01/31/female-founders-venture-capital-2017/\"> 2.2%</a> of total venture capital dollars.</p>\n<p>So it&rsquo;s not that surprising that many workers, investors, and journalists saw Holmes, playing that very role, and worked to lift her from college dropout to center stage. By the mid-2010s, she was suddenly everywhere, at <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/10/06/mpw-2014-livestream/\">tech conferences</a>, doing TED talks, and on the cover of <em>Fortune</em>, where a headline <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2015/10/26/11620036/theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmess-five-best-cover-story-appearances\">puzzled</a> whether she was the next Steve Jobs (the profile inside the issue launched her into the Silicon Valley mainstream).</p>\n<p>In <em>Bad Blood</em>, Carreyrou calls Holmes&rsquo; gaze &ldquo;<a href=\"https://qz.com/work/1285831/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-may-be-our-first-true-feminist-anti-hero/\">almost hypnotic</a>.&rdquo; &ldquo;From still photos of Holmes herself&mdash;young, blond, and blue-eyed&mdash;cynics might be excused for thinking, &lsquo;Oh, I get it. I see why all these geezers are gushing about her company,'&rdquo; reads the<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/\"> 2014 Fortune magazine profile</a>. &ldquo;And from small talk with her, one might still wonder what all the fuss was about. She is polite and soft-spoken. She listens. She laughs naturally at other people&rsquo;s jokes and doesn&rsquo;t try to trump them. Her voice is lower pitched than you might expect, but that&rsquo;s about all you notice at first. That, and her youth.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>The Inventor</em> implies that Holmes&rsquo; enchanting persona and position as the rare <a href=\"https://qz.com/work/1372843/quartz-analyzed-the-top-female-founders-to-understand-why-their-companies-are-worth-just-20-of-mens/\">woman in Silicon Valley </a>is what led donors to open their checkbooks, and old, white, male luminaries&mdash;like former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, former head of the CDC William Foege, and former senator Sam Nunn&mdash; to join her board before doing due diligence on her technology. Even as things began to fall apart, Holmes worked to maintain her cultivated image, the the cult of personality around it. As Tyler Shultz recalls in the film, a split developed between the &ldquo;carpeted world, where Elizabeth was a goddess, everyone worshipped the ground she walked on&hellip; [and] the tile side, where nothing works, it&rsquo;s a sinking ship, everything is a lie.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>The Inventor</em> is a sort of performative interpretation of the experience of those sucked in by Holmes&rsquo; personality in the early and mid 2010s. Photos and footage of Holmes, wide-eyed and slightly robotic, occupy much of the documentary&rsquo;s screen time. The film invites you to analyze her every gesture, her every microexpression, and try to figure out whether Holmes truly believed, or whether she was a con artist all along.</p>\n<p>Similarly, after her downfall, critics took to picking apart Holmes&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/03/226939/theranos-commercials-ads-marketing-elizabeth-holmes\">very public</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.in/the-story-of-how-elizabeth-holmes-arrived-at-her-infamous-black-turtleneck-steve-jobs-style-look/articleshow/64258373.cms\">consciously-constructed</a> appearance in search of a tell. Journalists have written about her<a href=\"https://theoutline.com/post/4821/anna-delvey-elizabeth-holmes-grifter-hair?zd=1&zi=te5zht2k\"> hair</a>, her<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/fashion/elizabeth-holmes-black-turtleneck-theranos.html\"> clothes</a>, the (apparently fake) timbre of her<a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/why-did-elizabeth-holmes-use-a-fake-deep-voice.html\"> voice</a>, as if these factors alone would indicate that she&rsquo;s somehow<a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/03/226401/elizabeth-holmes-narcissistic-boss-personality-traits\"> psychologically unwell</a>.</p>\n<p>Sexism wasn&rsquo;t responsible for Holmes&rsquo; downfall, of course. As <em>The Inventor</em> and other tellings make clear, her story is a lesson that you can&rsquo;t just keep faking it&mdash;you have to eventually make it. But there&rsquo;s a particular kind of way that powerful women fall, a revelry and pleasure in it that&rsquo;s less common with male leaders. And unlike hucksters that, say, created <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/15/technology/pixeloncom-founder-was-fugitive-from-virginia.html\">fake streaming services</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/aug/09/corporatefraud.worldcom2\">mismanaged their books</a>, Holmes&rsquo; deceit put patient lives on the line, permitting us to feel more entitled to celebrate her downfall as a kind of revenge.</p>\n<p><em>The Inventor</em>, because anyone who starts watching it knows how it will end, exists because of that schadenfreude. However, it&rsquo;s important to consider the role her gender may play in the pleasure of watching it. As reporter Ann Friedman <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/tech/a20954081/how-will-the-fall-of-theranoss-elizabeth-holmes-affect-women-leaders/\">last year in Elle</a>, we should be angry at Holmes&mdash;but we should also be wary of what we&rsquo;ll actually learn, culturally, from the story of Theranos. &ldquo;Women are constantly second-guessed; we struggle to be taken seriously when it comes to our experiences with harassment, our pain scale at the hospital, or our attempts to get the credit we deserve for our work,&rdquo; wrote reporter Ann Friedman <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/tech/a20954081/how-will-the-fall-of-theranoss-elizabeth-holmes-affect-women-leaders/\">last year in Elle</a>. &ldquo;So while a part of me admires Holmes&rsquo;s audacity, mostly I&rsquo;m angry with her for setting women back, for reinforcing the idea that we&rsquo;re not to be believed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>This story is part of How We&rsquo;ll Win in 2019, a year-long exploration of workplace gender equality. </em><a href=\"https://qz.com/is/how-well-win-2019/\"><em>Read more stories here</em></a><em>.</em></p>",

                "text": "Courtesy of HBO\nThis story is part of How We\u2019ll Win in 2019, a year-long exploration of workplace gender equality. Read more stories here.\nIt\u2019s been nearly five years since news first broke that Theranos, at the time a buzzy Silicon Valley-based healthcare company, may not have been all it promised. But our thirst for retellings of the story of the doomed company, and its founder, Elizabeth Holmes, seems inexhaustible. Yesterday (Mar. 18), we got another one: HBO\u2019s two-hour documentary, The Inventor.\nFor those already well acquainted with the story, the documentary offers little in terms of new facts. But more than in other tellings, The Inventor works to explain the public\u2019s willingness to believe a woman in tech if she\u2019s captivating in a certain way, and to find a particular kind of glee in her downfall.\nThe plot points of The Inventor don\u2019t stray too far from John Carreyrou\u2019s reporting for the Wall Street Journal, or his 2018 book Bad Blood, or the recent ABC podcast \u201cThe Dropout.\u201d Elizabeth Holmes was 19 when she dropped out of Stanford. Armed with a compelling narrative about a lifelong fear of needles and a dear uncle\u2019s early demise that could have been prevented with early diagnosis, Holmes launched Theranos to develop novel technology that would detect diseases from just a pinprick of blood. She was able to secure noteworthy public figures as board members and investors, and even a few large partnership deals, notably one with Walgreens, which offered the drug store\u2019s customers a menu of 200 blood tests, all available without prescription. But the Edison, Theranos\u2019 \u201cmicrofluidity\u201d blood-testing device, never actually worked. Lab techs at the company\u2019s headquarters either fudged results by using blood-testing machines built by other manufacturers, or sent faulty ones back to patients.\nThanks to whistleblowers and Carreyrou\u2019s dogged investigative reporting, the fraud perpetrated by Holmes and company president/COO (and Holmes\u2019 then-boyfriend) Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani, was made public. The company was sanctioned by government regulators, lost its Walgreens contract, and was sued; Holmes and Balwani were found guilty of massive fraud, and Theranos shut down.\nBoth the podcast and the HBO documentary include interviews with the whistleblowers: Tyler Shultz (the grandson of former secretary of state George Shultz, who sat on Theranos\u2019 board and was close to Holmes) and Erika Cheung (who worked as a lab associate at Theranos before alerting regulators to the company\u2019s sketchy practices).\nTheir perspectives help explain the cult of personality that developed around Holmes and her infectious idealism. \u201cIt was hard to really get a sense of who she was. But in a way I idolized her, based on the little I had read\u2014for being a woman in the sciences, being a woman in tech, the fact that she started her own company\u2014that really got me excited,\u201d says Cheung in the documentary. \u201cShe was a really good idol to have. In a sense I was super na\u00efve and drank the Kool-aid a little too quickly and was more enthusiastic to be a part of the team.\u201d.\nSilicon Valley suffers from a dearth of female leaders, especially those who\u2019ve invented their own technology and founded their own companies. In 2017, 17% of US-based startups had female founders, and they brought in about 2.2% of total venture capital dollars.\nSo it\u2019s not that surprising that many workers, investors, and journalists saw Holmes, playing that very role, and worked to lift her from college dropout to center stage. By the mid-2010s, she was suddenly everywhere, at tech conferences, doing TED talks, and on the cover of Fortune, where a headline puzzled whether she was the next Steve Jobs (the profile inside the issue launched her into the Silicon Valley mainstream).\nIn Bad Blood, Carreyrou calls Holmes\u2019 gaze \u201calmost hypnotic.\u201d \u201cFrom still photos of Holmes herself\u2014young, blond, and blue-eyed\u2014cynics might be excused for thinking, \u2018Oh, I get it. I see why all these geezers are gushing about her company,'\u201d reads the 2014 Fortune magazine profile. \u201cAnd from small talk with her, one might still wonder what all the fuss was about. She is polite and soft-spoken. She listens. She laughs naturally at other people\u2019s jokes and doesn\u2019t try to trump them. Her voice is lower pitched than you might expect, but that\u2019s about all you notice at first. That, and her youth.\u201d\nThe Inventor implies that Holmes\u2019 enchanting persona and position as the rare woman in Silicon Valley is what led donors to open their checkbooks, and old, white, male luminaries\u2014like former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, former head of the CDC William Foege, and former senator Sam Nunn\u2014 to join her board before doing due diligence on her technology. Even as things began to fall apart, Holmes worked to maintain her cultivated image, the the cult of personality around it. As Tyler Shultz recalls in the film, a split developed between the \u201ccarpeted world, where Elizabeth was a goddess, everyone worshipped the ground she walked on\u2026 [and] the tile side, where nothing works, it\u2019s a sinking ship, everything is a lie.\u201d\nThe Inventor is a sort of performative interpretation of the experience of those sucked in by Holmes\u2019 personality in the early and mid 2010s. Photos and footage of Holmes, wide-eyed and slightly robotic, occupy much of the documentary\u2019s screen time. The film invites you to analyze her every gesture, her every microexpression, and try to figure out whether Holmes truly believed, or whether she was a con artist all along.\nSimilarly, after her downfall, critics took to picking apart Holmes\u2019 very public, consciously-constructed appearance in search of a tell. Journalists have written about her hair, her clothes, the (apparently fake) timbre of her voice, as if these factors alone would indicate that she\u2019s somehow psychologically unwell.\nSexism wasn\u2019t responsible for Holmes\u2019 downfall, of course. As The Inventor and other tellings make clear, her story is a lesson that you can\u2019t just keep faking it\u2014you have to eventually make it. But there\u2019s a particular kind of way that powerful women fall, a revelry and pleasure in it that\u2019s less common with male leaders. And unlike hucksters that, say, created fake streaming services or mismanaged their books, Holmes\u2019 deceit put patient lives on the line, permitting us to feel more entitled to celebrate her downfall as a kind of revenge.\nThe Inventor, because anyone who starts watching it knows how it will end, exists because of that schadenfreude. However, it\u2019s important to consider the role her gender may play in the pleasure of watching it. As reporter Ann Friedman last year in Elle, we should be angry at Holmes\u2014but we should also be wary of what we\u2019ll actually learn, culturally, from the story of Theranos. \u201cWomen are constantly second-guessed; we struggle to be taken seriously when it comes to our experiences with harassment, our pain scale at the hospital, or our attempts to get the credit we deserve for our work,\u201d wrote reporter Ann Friedman last year in Elle. \u201cSo while a part of me admires Holmes\u2019s audacity, mostly I\u2019m angry with her for setting women back, for reinforcing the idea that we\u2019re not to be believed.\u201d\nThis story is part of How We\u2019ll Win in 2019, a year-long exploration of workplace gender equality.

On Feb. 26, the letter was <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-emma-thompson-john-lasseter-skydance-20190226-story.html\">published by The Los Angeles Times</a>, which said Thompson had shared it with the newspaper.</p>\n<p>What makes Thompson&rsquo;s letter such a satisfying read is her series of pointed questions that get to the hypocrisy at the heart of employment conditions like the ones Skydance set for Lasseter, who stepped down from Disney&rsquo;s Pixar in 2017 amid <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-lasseters-pattern-alleged-misconduct-detailed-by-disney-pixar-insiders-1059594\">allegations of unwanted touching and uncomfortable comments</a> made toward female employees.</p>\n<p>Since arriving at Skydance, Lasseter, who <a href=\"https://qz.com/work/1135543/read-disney-animation-chief-john-lasseters-memo-to-staff-about-his-alleged-behavior/\">has admitted to &ldquo;missteps</a>,&rdquo; has addressed his history, facing employees in several town hall meetings and asking for a second chance, according to the Times. Skydance employees also were informed that he signed a contract spelling out the rules for proper behavior around staff. Amid the backlash, Paramount Pictures Animation president Mireille Soria, whose company has a distribution deal with Skydance, oh-so-empathetically told female employees that they could choose not to work with Lasseter if they felt uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Thompson, meanwhile, called out Skydance&mdash;and effectively all organizations that have accommodated powerful men, knowing they have victimized women physically or emotionally, while potentially putting the women around them at risk. She asks:</p>\n<ul><li>If a man has been touching women inappropriately for decades, why would a woman want to work for him if the only reason he&rsquo;s not touching them inappropriately now is that it says in his contract that he must behave &ldquo;professionally&rdquo;?</li><li>If a man has made women at his companies feel undervalued and disrespected for decades, why should the women at his new company think that any respect he shows them is anything other than an act that he&rsquo;s required to perform by his coach, his therapist and his employment agreement? The message seems to be, &ldquo;I am learning to feel respect for women so please be patient while I work on it. It&rsquo;s not easy.&rdquo;</li><li>Much has been said about giving John Lasseter a &ldquo;second chance.&rdquo; But he is presumably being paid millions of dollars to receive that second chance. How much money are the employees at Skydance being paid to GIVE him that second chance?</li><li>If John Lasseter started his own company, then every employee would have been given the opportunity to choose whether or not to give him a second chance. But any Skydance employees who don&rsquo;t want to give him a second chance have to stay and be uncomfortable or lose their jobs. Shouldn&rsquo;t it be John Lasseter who has to lose HIS job if the employees don&rsquo;t want to give him a second chance?</li></ul>\n<p>Thompson also expresses regret at not being able to work on <em>Luck </em>with director Alessandro Carloni, best known for the <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> films. But, she essentially says, if I don&rsquo;t act, who will? In her closing line, she writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am well aware that centuries of entitlement to women&rsquo;s bodies whether they like it or not is not going to change overnight. Or in a year. But I am also aware that if people who have spoken out &mdash; like me &mdash; do not take this sort of a stand then things are very unlikely to change at anything like the pace required to protect my daughter&rsquo;s generation.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Notably, of course, this letter was not an empty threat, for Thompson had already quit <em>Luck</em>, taking a symbolic step on behalf of women who can&rsquo;t afford to do the same thing.</p>",

                "text": "Reuters/Luke MacGregor\nWhen the history of the #MeToo movement is written, there will no doubt be a section devoted to The Emma Thompson Letter.\nThe British actress, who walked away from Skydance Media\u2019s production of Luck in late January after the studio hired former Pixar executive John Lasseter to run its animation unit, explained her reasoning in a letter reportedly sent to Skydance management three days after she quit the project. On Feb. 26, the letter was published by The Los Angeles Times, which said Thompson had shared it with the newspaper.\nWhat makes Thompson\u2019s letter such a satisfying read is her series of pointed questions that get to the hypocrisy at the heart of employment conditions like the ones Skydance set for Lasseter, who stepped down from Disney\u2019s Pixar in 2017 amid allegations of unwanted touching and uncomfortable comments made toward female employees.\nSince arriving at Skydance, Lasseter, who has admitted to \u201cmissteps,\u201d has addressed his history, facing employees in several town hall meetings and asking for a second chance, according to the Times. Skydance employees also were informed that he signed a contract spelling out the rules for proper behavior around staff. Amid the backlash, Paramount Pictures Animation president Mireille Soria, whose company has a distribution deal with Skydance, oh-so-empathetically told female employees that they could choose not to work with Lasseter if they felt uncomfortable.\nThompson, meanwhile, called out Skydance\u2014and effectively all organizations that have accommodated powerful men, knowing they have victimized women physically or emotionally, while potentially putting the women around them at risk. She asks:\nIf a man has been touching women inappropriately for decades, why would a woman want to work for him if the only reason he\u2019s not touching them inappropriately now is that it says in his contract that he must behave \u201cprofessionally\u201d?\nIf a man has made women at his companies feel undervalued and disrespected for decades, why should the women at his new company think that any respect he shows them is anything other than an act that he\u2019s required to perform by his coach, his therapist and his employment agreement? The message seems to be, \u201cI am learning to feel respect for women so please be patient while I work on it. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d\nMuch has been said about giving John Lasseter a \u201csecond chance.\u201d But he is presumably being paid millions of dollars to receive that second chance. How much money are the employees at Skydance being paid to GIVE him that second chance?\nIf John Lasseter started his own company, then every employee would have been given the opportunity to choose whether or not to give him a second chance. But any Skydance employees who don\u2019t want to give him a second chance have to stay and be uncomfortable or lose their jobs. Shouldn\u2019t it be John Lasseter who has to lose HIS job if the employees don\u2019t want to give him a second chance?\nThompson also expresses regret at not being able to work on Luck with director Alessandro Carloni, best known for the Kung Fu Panda films. But, she essentially says, if I don\u2019t act, who will? In her closing line, she writes:\n\u201cI am well aware that centuries of entitlement to women\u2019s bodies whether they like it or not is not going to change overnight. Or in a year. But I am also aware that if people who have spoken out \u2014 like me \u2014 do not take this sort of a stand then things are very unlikely to change at anything like the pace required to protect my daughter\u2019s generation.\u201d\nNotably, of course, this letter was not an empty threat, for Thompson had already quit Luck, taking a symbolic step on behalf of women who can\u2019t afford to do the same thing.",

The joint effort of local, state, and federal cops managed to stop more than 400 cars and conduct 129 vehicle searches.</p>\n<p>How many opioids did all that effort yield? Less than a quarter gram of heroin.</p>\n<p>Rather than targeting opioids, the Interior Department's Opioid Reduction Task Force seems to have been used primarily to enforce immigration laws. According to a press release issued last week by the department, the operation conducted between March 20 and March 28 resulted in 50 arrests&mdash;with 42 of those arrests for &quot;illegal entry.&quot; Though the press release <a href=\"https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-law-enforcement-seizes-23-million-illegal-drugs-southern-border\">trumpeted</a> the fact that the task force seized $2.3 million in illegal drugs, nearly all of that total was marijuana, not opioids. (The feds also reported seizing 31 grams of meth.)</p>\n<p>That shouldn't be a surprise when you considering where the task force was deployed: on the Tohono O'odham Reservation, along the United States' southern border, and <em>not </em>at a port of entry. Most heroin and other opioids&mdash;and, indeed, most foreign drugs of all varieties&mdash;come into the United States through border checkpoints. The majority of heroin coming from Mexico is transported via privately owned vehicles &quot;entering the United States at legal ports of entry, followed by tractor-trailers, where the heroin is co-mingled with legal goods,&quot; the federal Drug Enforcement Administration concluded in a <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44599.pdf\">2018 report</a>.</p>\n<p>That's one of many reasons why building a massive wall along the length of the southern border is unlikely to staunch the flow of heroin into the country.</p>\n<p>It should also raise questions about why a federal opioid task force was deployed for eight days in a part of the country that does not include a port of entry. After all, if you're trying to stop opioids from coming into the country, it would make more sense to go where you're most likely to find opioids. The Interior Department did not respond to questions from <em>Reason </em>seeking further explanation about why the task force was deployed to the Tohono O'odham Reservation&mdash;and the department did not clarify whether it viewed the eight-day operation as a success, despite the apparent lack of opioid interdiction.</p>\n<p>What we do know is that the feds managed to harass lots of apparently innocent Americans&mdash;many of them likely Native Americans&mdash;in the effort. In addition to stopping 422 vehicles and searching 129 of them, the Opioid Reduction Task Force deployed its K-9 units 89 times and responded to 40 &quot;K-9 alerts.&quot; The task force also handed out 14 traffic tickets.</p>\n<p>In all, the Arizona deployment makes a pretty good argument against using federal law enforcement to combat the opioid trade. Americans who are addicted to heroin and other opioids need safe ways to ween themselves off dangerous drugs (and better access to non-lethal drugs in the first place), a strategy that has already paid off in places <a href=\"https://reason.com/2018/12/18/harm-reduction-is-helping-reduce-ohio-op/\">like Ohio</a>. Giving federal immigration cops&mdash;yes, Immigration and Customs Enforcement was included in the Opioid Reduction Task Force&mdash;another opportunity to demand to see proof of citizenship is not helping reduce opioid addictions or deaths. If anything, government enforcement efforts are only making opioids more dangerous by creating market conditions that benefit more potent, and potentially more deadly, alternatives like fentanyl, which can be <a href=\"https://reason.com/2018/12/05/after-boosting-the-fentanyl-market-drug/\">10 times as profitable</a> per kilogram than heroin.</p>\n<p>The Department of the Interior says its special opioid cops have seized &quot;millions of dollars worth of fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine and other drugs during the task force's first year of existence. But its pretty clear that the most recent operation was a dud.</p>\n<figure><video src=\"https://cdn5.anyclip.com/AW7_cY-xhs_tG0RTkS2i/1576243966687_1280x720_clip.mp4?wid=0011r000025cGJn_406\"></video></figure>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.366.0_en.html#goog_669882695\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "A special federal law enforcement task force dedicated to stopping the flow of opioids into the United States was deployed in southern Arizona for eight days in March. The joint effort of local, state, and federal cops managed to stop more than 400 cars and conduct 129 vehicle searches.\nHow many opioids did all that effort yield? Less than a quarter gram of heroin.\nRather than targeting opioids, the Interior Department's Opioid Reduction Task Force seems to have been used primarily to enforce immigration laws. According to a press release issued last week by the department, the operation conducted between March 20 and March 28 resulted in 50 arrests\u2014with 42 of those arrests for \"illegal entry.\" Though the press release trumpeted the fact that the task force seized $2.3 million in illegal drugs, nearly all of that total was marijuana, not opioids. (The feds also reported seizing 31 grams of meth.)\nThat shouldn't be a surprise when you considering where the task force was deployed: on the Tohono O'odham Reservation, along the United States' southern border, and not at a port of entry. Most heroin and other opioids\u2014and, indeed, most foreign drugs of all varieties\u2014come into the United States through border checkpoints. The majority of heroin coming from Mexico is transported via privately owned vehicles \"entering the United States at legal ports of entry, followed by tractor-trailers, where the heroin is co-mingled with legal goods,\" the federal Drug Enforcement Administration concluded in a 2018 report.\nThat's one of many reasons why building a massive wall along the length of the southern border is unlikely to staunch the flow of heroin into the country.\nIt should also raise questions about why a federal opioid task force was deployed for eight days in a part of the country that does not include a port of entry. After all, if you're trying to stop opioids from coming into the country, it would make more sense to go where you're most likely to find opioids. The Interior Department did not respond to questions from Reason seeking further explanation about why the task force was deployed to the Tohono O'odham Reservation\u2014and the department did not clarify whether it viewed the eight-day operation as a success, despite the apparent lack of opioid interdiction.\nWhat we do know is that the feds managed to harass lots of apparently innocent Americans\u2014many of them likely Native Americans\u2014in the effort. In addition to stopping 422 vehicles and searching 129 of them, the Opioid Reduction Task Force deployed its K-9 units 89 times and responded to 40 \"K-9 alerts.\" The task force also handed out 14 traffic tickets.\nIn all, the Arizona deployment makes a pretty good argument against using federal law enforcement to combat the opioid trade. Americans who are addicted to heroin and other opioids need safe ways to ween themselves off dangerous drugs (and better access to non-lethal drugs in the first place), a strategy that has already paid off in places like Ohio. Giving federal immigration cops\u2014yes, Immigration and Customs Enforcement was included in the Opioid Reduction Task Force\u2014another opportunity to demand to see proof of citizenship is not helping reduce opioid addictions or deaths. If anything, government enforcement efforts are only making opioids more dangerous by creating market conditions that benefit more potent, and potentially more deadly, alternatives like fentanyl, which can be 10 times as profitable per kilogram than heroin.\nThe Department of the Interior says its special opioid cops have seized \"millions of dollars worth of fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine and other drugs during the task force's first year of existence. But its pretty clear that the most recent operation was a dud.",

Instead, I will hear about Bernie Sanders, who it is fair to say she does not support. She hands me a flyer from Workers Vanguard with the title &quot;Bernie Sanders: Imperialist Running Dog.&quot;</p>\n<p>Democrats are not the answer, she says. I can agree with that, I say. This turns out to be a mistake, for she proceeds to try to convince me to buy a subscription to a newspaper she and several other revolutionaries loitering outside the conference are representing. It's not the only sales pitch I'll encounter at the conference.</p>\n<p>On the third floor, the registration area is flanked with tables peddling books, magazines, and political journals. One person is selling buttons and magnets made from old <i>Archie</i> comics, plus some artwork, including an eerie-yet-awesome image of Laura Palmer&mdash;the murder victim at the center of David Lynch's <em>Twin Peaks</em>&mdash;with eyes that follow me around the room. I have to resist the urge to buy it, settling for some magnets instead.</p>\n<p>I stop at the table of a journal called <i>New Politics</i>, which the man behind the desk, Jason Schulman, says was known last century for pushing the &quot;third way.&quot; Third way? Like the centrist Democrats? Bill Clinton? Ah, no. &quot;Neither Washington nor Moscow,&quot; Shulman explains.</p>\n<p>At a table for another political journal,<i> Upping the Anti</i>, from Canada, I pick up issues promising articles on safe-injection sites, the drug war in Canada, and state surveillance. There's also a piece on &quot;liberatory midwifery practice&quot; from a registered midwife who pushed for &quot;the right to access state-funded midwifery&quot; only to reckon with &quot;the trade-offs that state-sanctioned and funded midwifery would bring.&quot; The burdens of state licensing of midwives are categorized not as a problem of government overreach, but of &quot;class and white privilege&quot; and being &quot;petty bourgeois in orientation.&quot;</p>\n<p>Some of the books on display would be right at home on libertarian or anarchist bookshelves, but there are also plenty of covers featuring famous communists and hammers and sickles. Others seem almost like bizarro-world versions of the sorts of articles that might appear in this magazine: <i>Marx at the Arcade</i>. <i>Union Power</i>. <i>Occult Features of Anarchism. Climate Leviathan. </i></p>\n<p>It wasn't the only time I was struck by the quasi-overlap&mdash;a kind of uncanny valley similarity&mdash;with the ideological movement politics I regularly encounter in libertarian circles. As a libertarian at a socialist conference, I found plenty to object to and, on occasion, snicker at. But I also couldn't stop seeing ways we're all more alike than we'd like to admit, and wondering if that's what really matters.</p>\n<p>The two-day conference is set up as a series of hour-and-a-half-long panels, with about a dozen options per time slot. The panels all fall into one of 13 categories, including &quot;Colonialism and Anti-Imperialism,&quot; &quot;Historical Interrogations,&quot; &quot;Left Strategy,&quot; &quot;Labor,&quot; &quot;Queer Theory,&quot; and &quot;State Theory.&quot; They bear little resemblance to the kind of leftist topics and slogans that dominate online and in popular politics.</p>\n<p>I start with a panel called &quot;Perspectives on Socialist Strategy in the Democratic Socialists of America&quot; (DSA), which seems likely to offer the most tangible and timely information. Speakers come from different caucuses of the DSA, including a libertarian socialist faction represented today by John Michael Col&oacute;n. He says libertarian socialist caucus-members are &quot;not strictly anarchist&quot; but are &quot;united by a generally anarchistic conception of socialism,&quot; where democratically run &quot;counter-institutions to the state&quot; provide many services in conjunction with a more minimalist democratically-run government.</p>\n<p>One thing that quickly becomes clear is that DSA socialists are a factional bunch, and new splinter movements are perpetually rising up to challenge the old guard. Several of the caucuses represented on the panel had just been formed in the past year or two. And while the libertarian-socialist group is the oldest continually-running DSA caucuses, it, unfortunately, seems out of step with the others, all of which seem to envision a dramatically larger role for the state and less room for private enterprise.</p>\n<p>The Bread &amp; Roses Caucus, for example, aims to fuse &quot;a reborn and mighty workers' movement&quot; with the smaller Socialist Movement and advocate for things like Bernie 2020, Medicare for All, and the Green New Deal, according to a panelist named Neil. He says the '90s and 2000s &quot;will hopefully be the nadir of the socialist movement.&quot;</p>\n<p>The Socialist Majority Caucus, meanwhile, wants to &quot;directly confront capitalist economic and political power,&quot; says panelist Ren&eacute;e Paradis. It's hoping to move beyond the inter-DSA struggles that have consumed a lot of the party's time in the past few years&mdash;a result of the group effectively going &quot;from a series of book clubs to a mass organization overnight&quot; in 2016, she says&mdash;and help usher in a permanent socialist majority in the U.S. electorate.</p>\n<p>The North Star Caucus, perhaps the most conventional of the bunch, is concerned with countering Trump and &quot;the far right&quot; first and foremost, according to audience member Ethan, who happens to be a North Star member. He said their &quot;view reflects the more Michael Harrington vision&quot; of the party. Harrington was a 20th century author and labor organizer who, in the 1960s, debated free market advocates like Milton Friedman and William F. Buckley Jr. and also objected to more radical contingents of the young left. He went on to help form and then chair the DSA, believing that socialists must work within the Democratic Party. The divide between work-from-within partisan politics on the one hand and radical activism on the other is one that will be familiar to many libertarians.</p>\n<p>Ethan volunteers this information from the audience because the North Star panelist, Miriam Bensman, is running late.</p>\n<p>When Bensman arrives, she apologizes to everyone in the room for &quot;overestimating the [Metropolitan Transit Authority's] capacity,&quot; and folks snicker. I hate when people ask libertarians about using public roads, so I promise myself not to use her comment to set up some snark about government-run transit. I slip out to catch a different panel, where another speaker is also late. As I enter, she apologizes, then blames the unreliability of the New York City subway. I amend my position. I will not snark, but I will&hellip;<i>mention</i> this.</p>\n<p>There is no free lunch at the socialist conference, so we all break. Outside, the anti-Sanders crowd is now arguing with several police officers, who are telling them they must move and can't hand out flyers right in front of a school. The group is trying to make the cops see how important it is that they counter the message of those inside. The cops look bored.</p>\n<p>While watching, I strike up a conversation with Paradis, the panelist from earlier. I tell her I enjoyed hearing about DSA infighting because it makes me feel better about faction-splitting within libertarian circles. She says electoral politics are her main concern, but she came to the DSA from more standard liberal circles after looking at more progressive political issues and solutions through a more systematic and class-conscious lens. She appreciates the DSA for elevating concerns often ignored by mainstream politics.</p>\n<p>I tell her, more or less, <i>same</i>, but for libertarianism. So many of the people I know in libertarian politics are working on the same issues that keep coming up at the conference&mdash;criminal justice reform, immigration reform, barriers to health care and employment among the working classes, crony capitalism and the unfair advantages it creates. All the ways an overreaching government hits more marginalized people and communities harder.</p>\n<p>&quot;Not just lowering taxes and gun rights,&quot; I say. She nods, then gives me a look that seems skeptical, though I may be projecting. I am dead serious, of course, but this is not a place where I expect to be believed. Then Paradis says, &quot;I'm really hung over.&quot;</p>\n<p>Of course. Never reach for elaborate ideological explanations when the mundane and human will suffice.</p>\n<p>I look over to check in on the Workers Vanguard and the cops. They have agreed to move about 30 feet down the sidewalk. The woman I talked to earlier is walking by now and stops to look at me talking to Paradis. I suddenly feel ashamed. This is not the revolutionary vanguard, it's the accommodation faction! For a brief moment, I want to tell the older woman, don't worry, I am not on this one's side! But I'm not on the Russian Revolution Redux side, either. What is happening to me? Am I worried about being first up against the wall?</p>\n<p>I'm going to go get lunch, I tell Paradis. She is going home to take a nap. Au revoir, comrade.</p>\n<p>After lunch, I hit up the &quot;Law and Social Movements&quot; panel, which, based on the name, could be about almost anything. It turns out to be a robust discussion of totally disparate topics from organizers in the reproductive rights, immigration reform, and LGBTQ spheres.</p>\n<p>As so often happens with socialists, I found myself nodding along for much of it while periodically recoiling in horror. One panelist, Lea Ramirez, speaks out against immigration quotas that favor only highly-skilled workers from particular countries (yes!), but locates the source of historic and current immigration restrictions at large not with nativism, populism, and state control, but with &quot;the capitalist class&quot; and its pursuit of &quot;a highly exploitable&quot; workforce. Somehow, by keeping immigrants out and driving up the price of native-born U.S. labor, those wily capitalists are pursuing their bottom line.</p>\n<p>Talking about recent abortion battles in New York State, Megan Dey Lessard expresses disappointment with how little that mainstream Democratic politicians and women's rights groups seemed willing to settle for. They were content to allow regulators to control women's bodies so long as it was through &quot;public health code&quot; rather than criminal laws, she complains. And after pushing through a largely symbolic bill, expressed a wish to move on to sex education advocacy.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more so than with either mainstream &quot;liberals&quot; or &quot;conservatives&quot; these days, the far left tends to sound oddly similar to libertarians in a lot of ways&mdash;though neither group is keen to admit it. Democratic socialists are often willing to reject the endless litany of empty slogans, Culture War, and partisan kitsch of Republicans and Democrats. They are willing to speak up for civil liberties, and the dignity of the imprisoned, no matter who is in the White House, and they maintain a level-headed skepticism about the convenient political narratives, mostly centered on presidential personalities, that tend to dominate cable news.</p>\n<p>That's why the end-game solutions proposed by hardcore leftists always boggle my mind. How does anyone look at these systems and incentives, accurately see so many of their flaws&mdash;and then suggest that we can win by giving government thugs more control?</p>\n<p>Granted, Medicare bureaucrats are not exactly Border Patrol agents. But give them enough power and remove private alternatives, and the distinction becomes almost irrelevant. With a monopoly and moral certitude and a multi-billion-dollar budget, any arm of the state will eventually start operating in unintended, power-hoarding, and corrupt ways that hurt society's most marginalized. At the very least, they will consistently fail to perform adequately for large numbers of the people they are supposed to serve.</p>\n<p>Lessard alluded to this, recalling Carmen Rodriguez, a Puerto Rican <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/21/archives/abortion-death-reported-by-city-victim-is-first-here-since-state.html\">woman who died during an abortion at a New York City hospital in 1970</a>, not long after the state made it legal to terminate pregnancies with a doctor's permission. The city's municipal hospitals &quot;were in shambles,&quot; with one Bronx hospital &quot;able to perform three abortions per day&quot; with waiting lists of hundreds of women &quot;and people just lining up at the door,&quot; Lessard said. Rodriguez's death from heart complications after the procedure served as a &quot;flashpoint&quot; for rallying around the need to &quot;reclaim medical spaces&quot; and expand &quot;access to medical spaces in general.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes, abortion had become legalized,&quot; but there was still &quot;a gap between legalization and access,&quot; Lessard said.</p>\n<p>This is where capitalism comes in. Socialists often want to treat it as pure evil, a haven for corruption and amoral behavior. But capitalism is just an economic system where the provision of goods, services, and labor is determined by individuals negotiating with each other, rather than by a centralized state authority. Capitalism makes possible what government, paternalism, or altruism alone cannot.</p>\n<p>In a market-oriented system, private clinics&mdash;be they worker-run cooperatives, privately-funded philanthropic endeavors, or your traditional for-profit physician's office&mdash;can step in and fill the void. And in the decades since the '70s, many have. It wasn't capitalism that kept 20th century women from having abortions, but the state. And it's not capitalism that's now leading to clinic shutdowns, but politically motivated &quot;public health&quot; laws and other government policies.</p>\n<p>Even more than most health care, reproductive health services are saddled with high levels of regulation that strictly limit where, when, and how they can operate. These regulations go far beyond basic safety standards, and they represent a significant barrier to the provision of reproductive health services.</p>\n<p>What New York City women need, and have always needed, are freer, less regulated markets for contraception, abortion, and all-around reproductive health care, not more government-managed services.</p>\n<p>In substance and style, there are plenty of differences between a socialist conference and its libertarian equivalents. The historic school setting may have leant itself to an old book-swap vibe last weekend, but it also allowed for a level of radical chic no Marriott conference center can. Beyond the aesthetic realm, the gap grows even wider.</p>\n<p>It's hard to pinpoint any particularly dominant political platform from the motley group of academics, organizers, journalists, DSA members, authors, and others (including a good number of folks from the U.K. and Canada) who were gathered at the Socialism In Our Time conference. Yes, many called for expansion of government's role in health care, environmental regulation, and numerous other matters, but others questioned various facets of state authority, regulation, and power. There's no getting around the fact that their ready explanation for pretty much all of society's ills&mdash;capitalism&mdash;is what libertarians offer as a solution to an equally large variety of issues. Our core beliefs are fundamentally at odds.</p>\n<p>Still, I got a kick out of the similarities. The lopsidedly male crowd. The mix of media types and the professionally political, earnest kids, disheveled academics, and dour lifetimers. The feuding factions and squabbling cliques. The hangovers. (Oh god, the hangovers.) The obsession with dead economists. The bitter&mdash;yet hopeful&mdash;relationship to mainstream politics. The endless tiffs over immigration. The emphasis on the concrete over the symbolic on the one hand, and the stubborn attraction to a few passionate slogans on the other. In so many ways, libertarian and socialist gatherings feel like strange mirror images of each other.</p>\n<p>For both libertarians and socialists, most of society's problems can be traced back to a single root cause. For socialists, it's capitalism. For libertarians, the state. But unless you're a hardcore anarchist or the most ardent communist, there's a place for both. And the most insidious problems often flow out of intimate, ugly, accountability-free alliances between the two.</p>\n<p>I know we can't kumbaya our way out of this. Many of the major policy divides between libertarians and socialists are real and powerful. They can't all be resolved by turning our collective sights on the worst and agreed-upon abuses. But there are still so very many of those abuses to conquer. It seems like maybe that's what we should try to do.</p>\n<p>So to answer the question of the woman I met outside the conference: Yes, I really am interested in revolutionary politics. That's why I'm a libertarian. Radical respect for empowering individuals over the state is where my revolutionary sympathies lie.</p>\n<p>And I know that however absurd or impossible it sounds, there are a lot of libertarians, leftists, Democratic Socialists, Libertarian Party members, independents, anarchists, conservatives, liberals, and Americans of all or no political affiliations who agree&mdash;or, at the very least, think and talk about politics and society in surprisingly similar ways. It can't hurt for us revolutionaries, whichever side we're on, to occasionally remember that.</p>",

                "text": "\"Are you interested in revolutionary politics?\"\nAs I arrive at the location of the Socialism in Our Time Conference, a weekend-long summit organized by U.S. lefty mag Jacobin and the British Marxist journal Historical Materialism, a middle-aged woman approaches me to ask this question.\n\"I'm going in there,\" I say, gesturing toward the entrance, hoping this non-answer will suffice.\nIt does not.\n\"In there,\" she says, I will not hear about the Russian revolution, or black liberation, or true workers' rights. Instead, I will hear about Bernie Sanders, who it is fair to say she does not support. She hands me a flyer from Workers Vanguard with the title \"Bernie Sanders: Imperialist Running Dog.\"\nDemocrats are not the answer, she says. I can agree with that, I say. This turns out to be a mistake, for she proceeds to try to convince me to buy a subscription to a newspaper she and several other revolutionaries loitering outside the conference are representing. It's not the only sales pitch I'll encounter at the conference.\nOn the third floor, the registration area is flanked with tables peddling books, magazines, and political journals. One person is selling buttons and magnets made from old Archie comics, plus some artwork, including an eerie-yet-awesome image of Laura Palmer\u2014the murder victim at the center of David Lynch's Twin Peaks\u2014with eyes that follow me around the room. I have to resist the urge to buy it, settling for some magnets instead.\nI stop at the table of a journal called New Politics, which the man behind the desk, Jason Schulman, says was known last century for pushing the \"third way.\" Third way? Like the centrist Democrats? Bill Clinton? Ah, no. \"Neither Washington nor Moscow,\" Shulman explains.\nAt a table for another political journal, Upping the Anti, from Canada, I pick up issues promising articles on safe-injection sites, the drug war in Canada, and state surveillance. There's also a piece on \"liberatory midwifery practice\" from a registered midwife who pushed for \"the right to access state-funded midwifery\" only to reckon with \"the trade-offs that state-sanctioned and funded midwifery would bring.\" The burdens of state licensing of midwives are categorized not as a problem of government overreach, but of \"class and white privilege\" and being \"petty bourgeois in orientation.\"\nSome of the books on display would be right at home on libertarian or anarchist bookshelves, but there are also plenty of covers featuring famous communists and hammers and sickles. Others seem almost like bizarro-world versions of the sorts of articles that might appear in this magazine: Marx at the Arcade. Union Power. Occult Features of Anarchism. Climate Leviathan.\nIt wasn't the only time I was struck by the quasi-overlap\u2014a kind of uncanny valley similarity\u2014with the ideological movement politics I regularly encounter in libertarian circles. As a libertarian at a socialist conference, I found plenty to object to and, on occasion, snicker at. But I also couldn't stop seeing ways we're all more alike than we'd like to admit, and wondering if that's what really matters.\nThe two-day conference is set up as a series of hour-and-a-half-long panels, with about a dozen options per time slot. The panels all fall into one of 13 categories, including \"Colonialism and Anti-Imperialism,\" \"Historical Interrogations,\" \"Left Strategy,\" \"Labor,\" \"Queer Theory,\" and \"State Theory.\" They bear little resemblance to the kind of leftist topics and slogans that dominate online and in popular politics.\nI start with a panel called \"Perspectives on Socialist Strategy in the Democratic Socialists of America\" (DSA), which seems likely to offer the most tangible and timely information. Speakers come from different caucuses of the DSA, including a libertarian socialist faction represented today by John Michael Col\u00f3n. He says libertarian socialist caucus-members are \"not strictly anarchist\" but are \"united by a generally anarchistic conception of socialism,\" where democratically run \"counter-institutions to the state\" provide many services in conjunction with a more minimalist democratically-run government.\nOne thing that quickly becomes clear is that DSA socialists are a factional bunch, and new splinter movements are perpetually rising up to challenge the old guard. Several of the caucuses represented on the panel had just been formed in the past year or two. And while the libertarian-socialist group is the oldest continually-running DSA caucuses, it, unfortunately, seems out of step with the others, all of which seem to envision a dramatically larger role for the state and less room for private enterprise.\nThe Bread & Roses Caucus, for example, aims to fuse \"a reborn and mighty workers' movement\" with the smaller Socialist Movement and advocate for things like Bernie 2020, Medicare for All, and the Green New Deal, according to a panelist named Neil. He says the '90s and 2000s \"will hopefully be the nadir of the socialist movement.\"\nThe Socialist Majority Caucus, meanwhile, wants to \"directly confront capitalist economic and political power,\" says panelist Ren\u00e9e Paradis. It's hoping to move beyond the inter-DSA struggles that have consumed a lot of the party's time in the past few years\u2014a result of the group effectively going \"from a series of book clubs to a mass organization overnight\" in 2016, she says\u2014and help usher in a permanent socialist majority in the U.S. electorate.\nThe North Star Caucus, perhaps the most conventional of the bunch, is concerned with countering Trump and \"the far right\" first and foremost, according to audience member Ethan, who happens to be a North Star member. He said their \"view reflects the more Michael Harrington vision\" of the party. Harrington was a 20th century author and labor organizer who, in the 1960s, debated free market advocates like Milton Friedman and William F. Buckley Jr. and also objected to more radical contingents of the young left. He went on to help form and then chair the DSA, believing that socialists must work within the Democratic Party. The divide between work-from-within partisan politics on the one hand and radical activism on the other is one that will be familiar to many libertarians.\nEthan volunteers this information from the audience because the North Star panelist, Miriam Bensman, is running late.\nWhen Bensman arrives, she apologizes to everyone in the room for \"overestimating the [Metropolitan Transit Authority's] capacity,\" and folks snicker. I hate when people ask libertarians about using public roads, so I promise myself not to use her comment to set up some snark about government-run transit. I slip out to catch a different panel, where another speaker is also late. As I enter, she apologizes, then blames the unreliability of the New York City subway. I amend my position. I will not snark, but I will\u2026mention this.\nThere is no free lunch at the socialist conference, so we all break. Outside, the anti-Sanders crowd is now arguing with several police officers, who are telling them they must move and can't hand out flyers right in front of a school. The group is trying to make the cops see how important it is that they counter the message of those inside. The cops look bored.\nWhile watching, I strike up a conversation with Paradis, the panelist from earlier. I tell her I enjoyed hearing about DSA infighting because it makes me feel better about faction-splitting within libertarian circles. She says electoral politics are her main concern, but she came to the DSA from more standard liberal circles after looking at more progressive political issues and solutions through a more systematic and class-conscious lens. She appreciates the DSA for elevating concerns often ignored by mainstream politics.\nI tell her, more or less, same, but for libertarianism. So many of the people I know in libertarian politics are working on the same issues that keep coming up at the conference\u2014criminal justice reform, immigration reform, barriers to health care and employment among the working classes, crony capitalism and the unfair advantages it creates. All the ways an overreaching government hits more marginalized people and communities harder.\n\"Not just lowering taxes and gun rights,\" I say. She nods, then gives me a look that seems skeptical, though I may be projecting. I am dead serious, of course, but this is not a place where I expect to be believed. Then Paradis says, \"I'm really hung over.\"\nOf course. Never reach for elaborate ideological explanations when the mundane and human will suffice.\nI look over to check in on the Workers Vanguard and the cops. They have agreed to move about 30 feet down the sidewalk. The woman I talked to earlier is walking by now and stops to look at me talking to Paradis. I suddenly feel ashamed. This is not the revolutionary vanguard, it's the accommodation faction! For a brief moment, I want to tell the older woman, don't worry, I am not on this one's side! But I'm not on the Russian Revolution Redux side, either. What is happening to me? Am I worried about being first up against the wall?\nI'm going to go get lunch, I tell Paradis. She is going home to take a nap. Au revoir, comrade.\nAfter lunch, I hit up the \"Law and Social Movements\" panel, which, based on the name, could be about almost anything. It turns out to be a robust discussion of totally disparate topics from organizers in the reproductive rights, immigration reform, and LGBTQ spheres.\nAs so often happens with socialists, I found myself nodding along for much of it while periodically recoiling in horror. One panelist, Lea Ramirez, speaks out against immigration quotas that favor only highly-skilled workers from particular countries (yes!), but locates the source of historic and current immigration restrictions at large not with nativism, populism, and state control, but with \"the capitalist class\" and its pursuit of \"a highly exploitable\" workforce. Somehow, by keeping immigrants out and driving up the price of native-born U.S. labor, those wily capitalists are pursuing their bottom line.\nTalking about recent abortion battles in New York State, Megan Dey Lessard expresses disappointment with how little that mainstream Democratic politicians and women's rights groups seemed willing to settle for. They were content to allow regulators to control women's bodies so long as it was through \"public health code\" rather than criminal laws, she complains. And after pushing through a largely symbolic bill, expressed a wish to move on to sex education advocacy.\nPerhaps more so than with either mainstream \"liberals\" or \"conservatives\" these days, the far left tends to sound oddly similar to libertarians in a lot of ways\u2014though neither group is keen to admit it. Democratic socialists are often willing to reject the endless litany of empty slogans, Culture War, and partisan kitsch of Republicans and Democrats. They are willing to speak up for civil liberties, and the dignity of the imprisoned, no matter who is in the White House, and they maintain a level-headed skepticism about the convenient political narratives, mostly centered on presidential personalities, that tend to dominate cable news.\nThat's why the end-game solutions proposed by hardcore leftists always boggle my mind. How does anyone look at these systems and incentives, accurately see so many of their flaws\u2014and then suggest that we can win by giving government thugs more control?\nGranted, Medicare bureaucrats are not exactly Border Patrol agents. But give them enough power and remove private alternatives, and the distinction becomes almost irrelevant. With a monopoly and moral certitude and a multi-billion-dollar budget, any arm of the state will eventually start operating in unintended, power-hoarding, and corrupt ways that hurt society's most marginalized. At the very least, they will consistently fail to perform adequately for large numbers of the people they are supposed to serve.\nLessard alluded to this, recalling Carmen Rodriguez, a Puerto Rican woman who died during an abortion at a New York City hospital in 1970, not long after the state made it legal to terminate pregnancies with a doctor's permission. The city's municipal hospitals \"were in shambles,\" with one Bronx hospital \"able to perform three abortions per day\" with waiting lists of hundreds of women \"and people just lining up at the door,\" Lessard said. Rodriguez's death from heart complications after the procedure served as a \"flashpoint\" for rallying around the need to \"reclaim medical spaces\" and expand \"access to medical spaces in general.\"\n\"Yes, abortion had become legalized,\" but there was still \"a gap between legalization and access,\" Lessard said.\nThis is where capitalism comes in. Socialists often want to treat it as pure evil, a haven for corruption and amoral behavior. But capitalism is just an economic system where the provision of goods, services, and labor is determined by individuals negotiating with each other, rather than by a centralized state authority. Capitalism makes possible what government, paternalism, or altruism alone cannot.\nIn a market-oriented system, private clinics\u2014be they worker-run cooperatives, privately-funded philanthropic endeavors, or your traditional for-profit physician's office\u2014can step in and fill the void. And in the decades since the '70s, many have. It wasn't capitalism that kept 20th century women from having abortions, but the state. And it's not capitalism that's now leading to clinic shutdowns, but politically motivated \"public health\" laws and other government policies.\nEven more than most health care, reproductive health services are saddled with high levels of regulation that strictly limit where, when, and how they can operate. These regulations go far beyond basic safety standards, and they represent a significant barrier to the provision of reproductive health services.\nWhat New York City women need, and have always needed, are freer, less regulated markets for contraception, abortion, and all-around reproductive health care, not more government-managed services.\nIn substance and style, there are plenty of differences between a socialist conference and its libertarian equivalents. The historic school setting may have leant itself to an old book-swap vibe last weekend, but it also allowed for a level of radical chic no Marriott conference center can. Beyond the aesthetic realm, the gap grows even wider.\nIt's hard to pinpoint any particularly dominant political platform from the motley group of academics, organizers, journalists, DSA members, authors, and others (including a good number of folks from the U.K. and Canada) who were gathered at the Socialism In Our Time conference. Yes, many called for expansion of government's role in health care, environmental regulation, and numerous other matters, but others questioned various facets of state authority, regulation, and power. There's no getting around the fact that their ready explanation for pretty much all of society's ills\u2014capitalism\u2014is what libertarians offer as a solution to an equally large variety of issues. Our core beliefs are fundamentally at odds.\nStill, I got a kick out of the similarities. The lopsidedly male crowd. The mix of media types and the professionally political, earnest kids, disheveled academics, and dour lifetimers. The feuding factions and squabbling cliques. The hangovers. (Oh god, the hangovers.) The obsession with dead economists. The bitter\u2014yet hopeful\u2014relationship to mainstream politics. The endless tiffs over immigration. The emphasis on the concrete over the symbolic on the one hand, and the stubborn attraction to a few passionate slogans on the other. In so many ways, libertarian and socialist gatherings feel like strange mirror images of each other.\nFor both libertarians and socialists, most of society's problems can be traced back to a single root cause. For socialists, it's capitalism. For libertarians, the state. But unless you're a hardcore anarchist or the most ardent communist, there's a place for both. And the most insidious problems often flow out of intimate, ugly, accountability-free alliances between the two.\nI know we can't kumbaya our way out of this. Many of the major policy divides between libertarians and socialists are real and powerful. They can't all be resolved by turning our collective sights on the worst and agreed-upon abuses. But there are still so very many of those abuses to conquer. It seems like maybe that's what we should try to do.\nSo to answer the question of the woman I met outside the conference: Yes, I really am interested in revolutionary politics. That's why I'm a libertarian. Radical respect for empowering individuals over the state is where my revolutionary sympathies lie.\nAnd I know that however absurd or impossible it sounds, there are a lot of libertarians, leftists, Democratic Socialists, Libertarian Party members, independents, anarchists, conservatives, liberals, and Americans of all or no political affiliations who agree\u2014or, at the very least, think and talk about politics and society in surprisingly similar ways. It can't hurt for us revolutionaries, whichever side we're on, to occasionally remember that.",

In 2017, the last full year before the start of Trump's trade war, America exported $133 billion worth of food, beverage, and animal feed products, according to <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/07/news/economy/top-us-exports/index.html\">data</a> from the federal Department of Commerce. That's the largest single category of American exports&mdash;even outpacing the $109 billion of petroleum products the U.S. sent abroad that year, and nearly as much as all passenger car ($53 billion) and airplane ($99 billion) exports <em>combined. </em></p>\n<p>All those agricultural exports are great for the country as a whole, and for the individual farmers, truckers, and exporters who benefit from that trade. The dollars they earn by selling soybeans, corn, and produce to other countries is then used to buy other things&mdash;because that's how trade works&mdash;and often those other things are made in China. That's a problem for Trump's zero-sum economic nationalism.</p>\n<p>So when Trump decided to erect trade barriers in the form of tariffs on steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panels, and thousands of Chinese-made goods, he was throwing a <a href=\"https://reason.com/2019/03/05/trumps-tariffs-cost-the-us-economy-14-bi/\">giant presidential monkey wrench</a> into a cycle of buying-and-selling that benefited American farmers (and other business in the agriculture sector). And when China cut off purchases of American agricultural goods, it was American farmers who <a href=\"https://reason.com/2018/07/24/tariffs-are-so-great-farmers-need-help\">paid</a> the biggest price. Without those export markets to relieve excess supply, <a href=\"https://reason.com/2018/09/26/trump-bailout-farmers-soybeans-china\">prices fell</a> and supply chains had to be reconfigured <a href=\"https://reason.com/2018/08/10/ship-full-of-american-soybeans-trade-war/\">on the fly</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, the Trump administration's policy objectives were clear. American manufacturing had to be protected against cheaper products coming from China. If that meant farmers took it <a href=\"https://reason.com/2018/11/21/trumps-tariff-bailout-program-clusterfuk\">on the chin</a>, so be it.</p>\n<p>That's why it's a little bit ironic to see that, a year after the trade war started, the Trump administration is now trying to score a &quot;win for farmers&quot; by securing access to Chinese export markets in a new trade deal with China. That's how <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-15/china-said-to-weigh-u-s-request-to-shift-tariffs-on-farm-goods\">describes</a> the latest gambit in the ongoing trade negotiations between the two nations, in which Trump's team is asking China to shift $50 billion of retaliatory tariffs off agricultural goods and onto other American exports in advance of next year's elections. The U.S. would maintain its own tariffs on Chinese goods even if a trade deal is reached, the news organization reports, citing sources familiar with the negotiations.</p>\n<p>That's stunning. The Trump administration's newest trade negotiating tactic is to ask China to put tariffs on American manufactured goods&mdash;the very sector Trump's trade war was supposed to be helping&mdash;in order to relieve the pain the trade war caused for American farmers.</p>\n<p>And what's going to happen if China goes along with that idea? Like before, American farmers will export goods to China, and then will use the money they earn to buy other things&mdash;because that's how trade works&mdash;and often those other things will be made in China.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's not enough to switch tariffs from farm products to manufactured goods; the Trump administration also wants to encourage the Chinese to buy more U.S. farm products than ever before, which will cause China to send even more manufactured goods to America,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/the-strange-endgame-of-protectionism/\">writes</a> Scott Sumner, an economist with the Mercatus Center, a free market think tank. &quot;Any policy that encourages the export of farm products also encourages the import of manufactured goods. (There's a reason they call it 'trade'.)&quot;</p>\n<p>On one hand, it's great that the Trump administration is effectively admitting a mistake and trying to reverse course out of the mess it created. China was already buying lots of American agricultural goods before Trump <a href=\"https://reason.com/2018/12/28/good-and-easy-to-win-2018-trade-recap\">came along</a>, but if he wants to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-15/farmers-fear-china-trade-deal-will-fail-to-erase-counter-tariffs\">basically restore</a> the old status quo and claim that he &quot;won&quot; something for American farmers&mdash;well, fine, that's what politicians do all the time.</p>\n<p>But that's some serious goalpost-moving on the administration's part. And if the past year's efforts at protecting American manufacturing jobs end with China slapping tariffs on American manufacturing goods <em>at the Trump administration's request</em>, well, I'm not sure how that will go down in all those Rust Belt diners.</p>\n<figure><video src=\"https://cdn5.anyclip.com/AW7_cY-xhs_tG0RTkS2i/1576243966687_1280x720_clip.mp4?wid=0011r000025cGJn_406\"></video></figure>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.365.1_en.html#goog_1845185661\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Advertisement</p>",

                "text": "At the center of the economic nationalism that underpins President Donald Trump's trade agenda, there's a seemingly unsolvable agriculture problem: America grows more food than it eats.\nA lot more, actually, and all that agricultural excess has to go somewhere. In 2017, the last full year before the start of Trump's trade war, America exported $133 billion worth of food, beverage, and animal feed products, according to data from the federal Department of Commerce. That's the largest single category of American exports\u2014even outpacing the $109 billion of petroleum products the U.S. sent abroad that year, and nearly as much as all passenger car ($53 billion) and airplane ($99 billion) exports combined.\nAll those agricultural exports are great for the country as a whole, and for the individual farmers, truckers, and exporters who benefit from that trade. The dollars they earn by selling soybeans, corn, and produce to other countries is then used to buy other things\u2014because that's how trade works\u2014and often those other things are made in China. That's a problem for Trump's zero-sum economic nationalism.\nSo when Trump decided to erect trade barriers in the form of tariffs on steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panels, and thousands of Chinese-made goods, he was throwing a giant presidential monkey wrench into a cycle of buying-and-selling that benefited American farmers (and other business in the agriculture sector). And when China cut off purchases of American agricultural goods, it was American farmers who paid the biggest price. Without those export markets to relieve excess supply, prices fell and supply chains had to be reconfigured on the fly.\nStill, the Trump administration's policy objectives were clear. American manufacturing had to be protected against cheaper products coming from China. If that meant farmers took it on the chin, so be it.\nThat's why it's a little bit ironic to see that, a year after the trade war started, the Trump administration is now trying to score a \"win for farmers\" by securing access to Chinese export markets in a new trade deal with China. That's how Bloomberg describes the latest gambit in the ongoing trade negotiations between the two nations, in which Trump's team is asking China to shift $50 billion of retaliatory tariffs off agricultural goods and onto other American exports in advance of next year's elections. The U.S. would maintain its own tariffs on Chinese goods even if a trade deal is reached, the news organization reports, citing sources familiar with the negotiations.\nThat's stunning. The Trump administration's newest trade negotiating tactic is to ask China to put tariffs on American manufactured goods\u2014the very sector Trump's trade war was supposed to be helping\u2014in order to relieve the pain the trade war caused for American farmers.\nAnd what's going to happen if China goes along with that idea? Like before, American farmers will export goods to China, and then will use the money they earn to buy other things\u2014because that's how trade works\u2014and often those other things will be made in China.\n\"It's not enough to switch tariffs from farm products to manufactured goods; the Trump administration also wants to encourage the Chinese to buy more U.S. farm products than ever before, which will cause China to send even more manufactured goods to America,\" writes Scott Sumner, an economist with the Mercatus Center, a free market think tank. \"Any policy that encourages the export of farm products also encourages the import of manufactured goods. (There's a reason they call it 'trade'.)\"\nOn one hand, it's great that the Trump administration is effectively admitting a mistake and trying to reverse course out of the mess it created. China was already buying lots of American agricultural goods before Trump came along, but if he wants to basically restore the old status quo and claim that he \"won\" something for American farmers\u2014well, fine, that's what politicians do all the time.\nBut that's some serious goalpost-moving on the administration's part. And if the past year's efforts at protecting American manufacturing jobs end with China slapping tariffs on American manufacturing goods at the Trump administration's request, well, I'm not sure how that will go down in all those Rust Belt diners.\nAdvertisement",

He launched missiles into Syria. He ordered American troops home from Syria. He then reversed himself and sorta-kinda agreed to keep them there for a while longer.</p>\n<p>But on Tuesday night, Trump unambiguously backed Forever War. He vetoed a congressional resolution that would have ended American military involvement in the Yemeni civil war&mdash;a conflict that has killed an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the-deadly-war-in-yemen-rages-on-so-why-does-the-death-toll-stand-still-/2018/08/02/e6d9ebca-9022-11e8-ae59-01880eac5f1d_story.html?utm_term=.40e224b5ca97\">estimated 50,000 people</a> (scores more have died in a famine triggered by the conflict) without having any significant bearing on U.S. national security.</p>\n<p>&quot;This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,&quot; Trump said in a statement. The congressional resolution is unnecessary, Trump says, because &quot;the United States is not engaged in hostilities in or affecting Yemen.&quot;</p>\n<p>That's being too clever by half. Yes, there are no American troops fighting on the front lines in Yemen, but the Trump administration has been providing logistical support and intelligence to the Saudi-backed coalition that's fighting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. American-flown planes are being used to refuel Saudi aircraft in mid-air, for example. Trump's own veto statement belies the internal contradiction, with its nod to American &quot;service members&quot; who are very much participants in the bloody, seemingly intractable conflict.</p>\n<p>The resolution calling for an end to that military support, sponsored by Rep. Ro Khanna (D&ndash;Calif.), <a href=\"https://reason.com/2019/02/14/house-bill-to-end-us-backing-for-saudi-a\">says</a> &quot;the activities that the United States is conducting in support of the Saudi-led coalition, including aerial refueling and targeting assistance, fall within&quot; the authority of the War Powers Act of 1973. That law was passed in the closing stages of the Vietnam War, with the intention of preventing a president from getting America into another years-long conflict without congressional authorization (please, hold your laughter).</p>\n<p>The resolution cleared both chambers of Congress with <a href=\"https://reason.com/2019/04/04/house-votes-to-end-unauthorized-us-invol\">bipartisan approval</a>, but not a veto-proof majority in either. (Notably, libertarian-leaning Rep. Justin Amash (R&ndash;Mich.) voted &quot;present&quot; on the resolution in the House due to concerns over how it might expand congressional authorization for other Middle Eastern wars.)*</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Amash took to Twitter to explain that the resolution was unnecessary anyway&mdash;Trump does not have the authority to commit U.S. forces to the Yemeni civil war in the first place</p>\n<blockquote><p>.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@POTUS</a> doesn't have authority to engage our Armed Forces in this war regardless of this joint resolution. Congress never authorized war, so it's unconstitutional and unlawful for the president to have entered the U.S. into hostilities. Stop aiding the Saudis in this brutality. <a href=\"https://t.co/xWFSOWgLYc\">https://t.co/xWFSOWgLYc</a></p><p>&mdash; Justin Amash (@justinamash) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/1118321370742628355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 17, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Still, it's something of an accomplishment, since this is the first time a congressional resolution invoking the War Powers Act has reached the president's desk.</p>\n<p>But that won't be enough until America has a president actually willing to rein in America's foreign military excursions&mdash;instead of merely promising to do so to get elected.</p>\n<p><em>*CORRECTION: This post has been updated to correct the fact that Amash voted &quot;present&quot; on the resolution, and to add his tweet.*</em></p>",

                "text": "As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump promised to put some reasonable limitations on how the United States conducted its post-9/11 wars across the Middle East.\n\"The legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess,\" he said in April 2016, during his first major speech about foreign policy. \"We've made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before.\"\nSince taking office, Trump's track record has been decidedly mixed. He launched missiles into Syria. He ordered American troops home from Syria. He then reversed himself and sorta-kinda agreed to keep them there for a while longer.\nBut on Tuesday night, Trump unambiguously backed Forever War. He vetoed a congressional resolution that would have ended American military involvement in the Yemeni civil war\u2014a conflict that has killed an estimated 50,000 people (scores more have died in a famine triggered by the conflict) without having any significant bearing on U.S. national security.\n\"This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,\" Trump said in a statement. The congressional resolution is unnecessary, Trump says, because \"the United States is not engaged in hostilities in or affecting Yemen.\"\nThat's being too clever by half. Yes, there are no American troops fighting on the front lines in Yemen, but the Trump administration has been providing logistical support and intelligence to the Saudi-backed coalition that's fighting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. American-flown planes are being used to refuel Saudi aircraft in mid-air, for example. Trump's own veto statement belies the internal contradiction, with its nod to American \"service members\" who are very much participants in the bloody, seemingly intractable conflict.\nThe resolution calling for an end to that military support, sponsored by Rep. Ro Khanna (D\u2013Calif.), says \"the activities that the United States is conducting in support of the Saudi-led coalition, including aerial refueling and targeting assistance, fall within\" the authority of the War Powers Act of 1973. That law was passed in the closing stages of the Vietnam War, with the intention of preventing a president from getting America into another years-long conflict without congressional authorization (please, hold your laughter).\nThe resolution cleared both chambers of Congress with bipartisan approval, but not a veto-proof majority in either. (Notably, libertarian-leaning Rep. Justin Amash (R\u2013Mich.) voted \"present\" on the resolution in the House due to concerns over how it might expand congressional authorization for other Middle Eastern wars.)*\nOn Tuesday, Amash took to Twitter to explain that the resolution was unnecessary anyway\u2014Trump does not have the authority to commit U.S. forces to the Yemeni civil war in the first place\n.@POTUS doesn't have authority to engage our Armed Forces in this war regardless of this joint resolution. Congress never authorized war, so it's unconstitutional and unlawful for the president to have entered the U.S. into hostilities. Stop aiding the Saudis in this brutality. https://t.co/xWFSOWgLYc\n\u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) April 17, 2019\nStill, it's something of an accomplishment, since this is the first time a congressional resolution invoking the War Powers Act has reached the president's desk.\nBut that won't be enough until America has a president actually willing to rein in America's foreign military excursions\u2014instead of merely promising to do so to get elected.\n*CORRECTION: This post has been updated to correct the fact that Amash voted \"present\" on the resolution, and to add his tweet.*",

Is it specialized equipment? That's the question,&quot; he says. And since the answer isn't always clear, he errs on the side of charging the tax&mdash;better to overcharge a customer than to face the wrath of the taxman, after all.</p>\n<p>Heitman and his wife, Carla, have been running <a href=\"https://www.pegasusautoracing.com/\">Pegasus Auto Racing Supplies</a> since they founded the company back in 1980, out of a two-story building in New Berlin, Wisconsin. Until last year, that meant Heitman was responsible for collecting and paying sales taxes to exactly one place: the Wisconsin Department of Revenue. But thanks to an under-the-radar ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court in June, he's now receiving letters, phone calls, and emails from revenue officials across the country, each wanting a piece of his business.</p>\n<p>The source of Heitman's frustrations is <em><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-494_j4el.pdf\">Wayfair v. South Dakota</a>,</em> which allowed states to collect sales taxes from online businesses located beyond their borders. Many states view the <em>Wayfair</em> ruling as a potential tax revenue windfall in which the taxes are paid by non-residents who can't vote against them. That's why businesses like Heitman's are now facing the chilling prospect of owing taxes in dozens, and possibly hundreds, of different jurisdictions&mdash;while being hounded by out-of-state tax collectors.</p>\n<p>Since the Supreme Court issued its ruling in June, Heitman has been scrambling to become compliant with tax commissions and revenue departments from coast to coast. He's spent thousands of dollars on new software to help navigate the complexities of state sales tax law, but that's only been so much help. &quot;It almost seems like I have another full time job dumped on me with this sales tax thing,&quot; he says. &quot;It's burning me out.&quot;</p>\n<p>As the 2019 tax season begins, states are ramping up efforts to squeeze extra revenue out of remote retailers like Heitman, putting an expensive new burden on businesses that have found broad customer bases online. The burden is particularly large in the five U.S. states that charge no sales tax, where entrepreneurs could now be charged with paying a tax they have never had to pay before, to a government over which they have no voice. And while Congress could clean up the Supreme Court's mess, it's far from certain that it will.</p>\n<p><strong>The Supreme Court Overturns a Sales Tax Precedent</strong></p>\n<p>The question of whether states can charge taxes on out-of-state goods predates the U.S. Constitution. In fact, it's one of the primary reasons it came into being in 1787.</p>\n<p>The Articles of Confederation allowed each state to set its own rules for cross-border trade, creating barriers to interstate commerce. The Constitution thus gave the federal government explicit control over interstate commerce. In Federalist 42, James Madison said this was necessary, because otherwise states &quot;would nourish unceasing animosities, and not improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public tranquility.&quot;</p>\n<p>In the decades that followed, various Supreme Court rulings developed into a legal doctrine known as the &quot;dormant Commerce Clause.&quot; This assumes the Constitution forbids state-level policies that limit the free flow of commerce. That rationale was the basis of <em><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-0194.ZO.html\">Quill Corp v. North Dakota</a>, a</em> 1992 Supreme Court ruling blocking North Dakota from collecting sales tax from a catalog-based office retailer that sold goods to other businesses in the state, but that did not have a physical location in North Dakota.</p>\n<p>Last year, South Dakota succeeded where North Dakota had failed. At the root of the <em>Wayfair</em> case was a South Dakota law claiming that the state had the authority to collect sales tax from any business that made at least 200 transactions or $100,000 in sales into South Dakota in a single year. The Supreme Court upheld that law, and ruled that the 1992 North Dakota ruling was &quot;unsound and incorrect,&quot; as Justice Anthony Kennedy put it in the majority opinion&mdash;the last that he would author before retiring in July.</p>\n<p>The earlier <em>Quill</em> ruling, he wrote, had become &quot;a judicially created tax shelter for businesses that decide to limit their physical presence and still sell their goods and services to a state's consumers&mdash;something that has become easier and more prevalent as technology has advanced.&quot; The 5-4 majority cut across the Supreme Court's usual ideological lines, with Ruth Bader Ginsburg joining conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and the moderate Kennedy in support of South Dakota's law.</p>\n<p>The court's liberal wing, minus Ginsburg, joined Chief Justice John Roberts' dissenting opinion, which largely agreed with Kennedy that <em>Quill</em> was decided incorrectly, but insisted it was Congress' duty to fix that problem.</p>\n<p>&quot;By suddenly changing the ground rules, the Court may have waylaid Congress' consideration of the issue,&quot; Roberts wrote. States had been petitioning Congress for years to change the rules for interstate sales taxes, but Roberts worried that an abrupt change of direction ordered by the courts would steer state efforts towards &quot;securing new tax revenue from remote sellers.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>A Ruling Both &quot;Sweeping and Vague&quot;</strong></p>\n<p>In the months since the <em>Wayfair</em> ruling, Roberts' concerns have been vindicated. The ruling was both &quot;sweeping and vague,&quot; says Andrew Moylan, vice president of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for lowering taxes. &quot;The result is that there's an enormous amount of gray area that states, businesses, and policy experts are trying to define in the face of very thin guidance from the Court.&quot;</p>\n<p>The most important of those gray areas is the question of when a business is considered to have done enough business in a certain state to owe sales tax there. The South Dakota law that was the basis of the <em>Wayfair</em> case specifies a threshold of 200 transactions or $100,000 worth of sales. That's a high enough threshold to exempt most small businesses and online sellers from owing sales taxes to South Dakota. But using the same standards in a state with a lot more potential buyers&mdash;California, for example, whose economy is more than 50 times larger than South Dakota's&mdash;has the potential to ensnare many more businesses.</p>\n<p>With no clear instruction from the federal government, states have quickly stepped up to fill in their own. Days after the ruling, lawmakers in New Jersey introduced a bill to hit out-of-state retailers with a 6.625 percent tax on sales into the state&mdash;and state lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.bna.com/state-wayfair-new-n73014483056/\">touted</a> the potential for it to generate more than $300 million in annual revenue.</p>\n<p>In many cases, new legislation wasn't even required. In January, the New York Department of Taxation and Finance <a href=\"https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2019/01/16/new-york-sets-its-online-sales-tax-rules/\">reinterpreted</a> existing sales tax rules to cover any business that does more than $300,000 of gross sales in the state or made 100 transactions with New York customers. The California Department of Tax and Fee Administrators <a href=\"https://www.avalara.com/us/en/blog/2018/12/california-will-tax-sales-by-out-of-state-sellers-starting-april-1-2019.html\">announced in December</a> that remote sellers will owe taxes if they do more than $100,000 in California sales or have 200 transactions. The state expects to generate $500 million from those new collections. Most other states have made similar changes to their laws or tax codes, or are now considering such changes.</p>\n<p>It's not just states. In many places, counties and cities have their own sales taxes applied on top of the state rate. In the 45 states with sales taxes, there are more than 12,000 tax jurisdictions, says Moylan. Although it is unlikely that a small business would do enough sales in that many locations to hit the sales tax threshold, it's not impossible. Heitman does enough sales in California that he worries he could be on the hook for taxes in some of those local jurisdiction too&mdash;although he's not entirely sure.</p>\n<p>&quot;It almost seems like I have another full time job dumped on me with this sales tax thing. It's burning me out.&quot;</p>\n<p>Determining where and what a business owes is its own burden, and the largest costs are born by medium-sized businesses like Heitmans. Bigger businesses are better able to handle the increased compliance costs created by <em>Wayfair</em>, and truly small businesses are unlikely to surpass the various sales thresholds to trigger tax collections&mdash;but for those in the middle, the sudden shift in the playing field is &quot;hair-raising,&quot; says David Mittelstadt, a tax attorney from Chattanooga, Tennessee, and chairman of the Tennessee Bar Association's tax section.</p>\n<p>The transaction limits are what will capture many of them, he predicts. &quot;Because, you know, 200 sales when you're selling industrial turbines is one thing,&quot; says Mittelstadt. &quot;If you're selling t-shirts, you could hit those thresholds at a very low volume of sales.&quot;</p>\n<p>That's exactly what's facing Kenny Ballard, CEO of The Mountain, a New Hampshire-based company that sells T-shirts online&mdash;including the <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/three-wolf-moon\">internet-famous shirt featuring three wolves howling at the Moon</a>. At approximately $25 per shirt, 200 sales into a certain state is a mere $5,000 in revenue for Ballard's company but would be enough to trigger tax obligations, cutting into profits and requiring new expenditures on reporting and compliance.</p>\n<p>For business owners, the challenge isn't just determining <em>if</em> they owe, it's determining <em>what</em>. State sales tax codes are <a href=\"https://www.thestate.com/news/databases/article67972727.html\">notoriously complex</a>, and no two are exactly alike. In Pennsylvania, for example, most clothing is exempt from the state's 6 percent sales tax&mdash;unless it is considered formalwear or recreational equipment. In practice, that means a pair of gloves would not be taxed, except if it's considered skiing equipment, in which case the exact same pair of gloves <em>would</em> be taxed. New York taxes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoo-hoo\">Yoo-hoo</a>, a milky, chocolatey drink&mdash;but not chocolate milk. Coffee is not subject to sales tax in Colorado, but you will be charged tax if you get a to-go cup with a lid, which is considered &quot;nonessential packaging&quot; under state law.</p>\n<p>That's why Heitman spends a lot of time thinking about the tax status of fireproof underwear, but he's hardly alone. Micro-retailers operating through marketplace sites like Etsy, for example, sell all variety of handmade items&mdash;from homemade moccasins to <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/624581691/unicorn-fluff?gpla=1&gao=1&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_us_e-toys_and_games-toys-stress_balls_and_desk_toys-stress_balls&utm_custom1=b2ab2602-bee9-4b24-b52a-626f235e679a&utm_content=go_304504715_43125413456_196679277570_pla-317749458635_c__624581691&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5JCE1KuO4QIVBUGGCh013weKEAQYAiABEgIxc_D_BwE\">unicorn fluff</a>. Adding to the confusion, transactions of non-taxable goods in some states still count towards the overall transaction threshold that determines whether a seller has to pay taxes. Since the <em>Wayfair</em> ruling, Etsy has <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/seller-handbook/article/understanding-internet-sales-tax-laws/417251291079\">updated</a> its seller handbook to keep users aware of the shifting playing fields, and the platform is now collecting and paying sales taxes on behalf of users in states where the laws have changed.</p>\n<p>For small businesses operating outside of an online marketplace, software can help navigate the complexity of suddenly having to understand thousands of different tax codes. But it's only so useful, and it can be expensive. Heitman says he paid $6,000 for a program that calculates taxes owed based on buyers' ZIP codes, but it's also brought him additional frustration. &quot;Some of the addresses cannot be validated,&quot; he says, recalling an order that was shipped to a building at Newark Airport. The address was rejected because it was not in the U.S. Postal Service database. &quot;Apparently the Postal Service doesn't deliver there&mdash;but this was a large package shipped by UPS.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;It's just ridiculously time-consuming every month,&quot; he says.</p>\n<p><strong>A Problem Fixed by Software&mdash;or Congress?</strong></p>\n<p>In writing the majority opinion in <em>Wayfair,</em> Justice Kennedy waved away some of Roberts' worries about how the court's abrupt overturning of the decades-old precedent would create chaos by pointing to the fact that computers could solve the mess&mdash;or that they would, maybe.</p>\n<p>&quot;Eventually, software that is available at a reasonable cost may make it easier for small businesses to cope with these problems,&quot; he wrote. And if that doesn't fix it, he added with one of the all-time great hand-waves in Supreme Court history: &quot;In all events, Congress may legislate to address these problems if it deems it necessary and fit to do so.&quot;</p>\n<p>So, will it?</p>\n<p>Even before <em>Wayfair</em>, there were good reasons for congressional action on an issue that fits very squarely within the enumerated power of the federal government to regulate interstate commerce. In the wake of last year's Supreme Court ruling, congressional involvement now seems both more urgently needed and less likely to happen.</p>\n<p>One potential vehicle for resolving problems created by <em>Wayfair</em> is <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6824/text\">a bill</a> sponsored by Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.), first introduced in October and likely to be re-introduced to the new session of Congress within the coming weeks. His bill, the Online Sales Simplicity and Small Business Relief Act, would add important specifics like prohibiting states from collecting out-of-state sales taxes on transactions that occurred before January 1, 2019, essentially giving businesses much-needed time to get up to speed on the new requirements without suddenly being hit with tax bills they weren't expecting.</p>\n<p>Most important of all, the bill would create a $10 million sales tax exemption for all small businesses that do not have a physical presence in a given state. That means upping the $100,000 threshold in the South Dakota law that triggered the <em>Wayfair</em> case to a level far in excess of what a small business would have in sales&mdash;effectively removing the ability of states to target all but the largest of remote sellers.</p>\n<p>&quot;Small business owners, in particular, have shared fears that they will be unable to bear the new compliance burdens and may have to shutter their businesses,&quot; Sensenbrenner says. &quot;I've heard from online sellers in Wisconsin and across the country who are concerned with the complexity of the post-<em>Wayfair</em> tax regime.&quot;</p>\n<p>The bill is likely to have bipartisan support in the House this year, with Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) lined up as co-sponsors, along with Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.).</p>\n<p>But cities and states eyeing a windfall in new tax revenue are likely to organize against congressional action. Late last year, a coalition of groups including the Council of State Governments, National Association of Counties, and the United States Conference of Mayors sent <a href=\"https://www.usmayors.org/2017/04/28/state-local-governments-urge-congress-to-preserve-state-and-local-tax-deduction-and-tax-exempt-municipal-bonds-in-tax-reform-efforts/\">a letter</a> to Congress decrying efforts to &quot;undermine&quot; the <em>Wayfair</em> ruling.</p>\n<p><strong>States With No Sales Tax Fight Back</strong></p>\n<p>While many states likely will work to keep the <em>Wayfair</em> ruling, a smaller group are already organizing to fight its effects. No state is likely to fight harder than New Hampshire, which has a long track record of defending its residents from out-of-state tax collection.</p>\n<p>In December 1976, the New Hampshire State Police literally arrested two agents from the Massachusetts Tax Commission. The agents had been staking out a parking lot in the small town of Hinsdale, barely five miles north of the Massachusetts border, looking for Massachusetts license plates as part of an effort by other New England states to crack down on tax-free cross-border holiday shopping. Unhappy with other states targeting shoppers and businesses in New Hampshire, Gov. Meldrim Thomson told the state police to keep an eye out for revenue agents&mdash;and to charge them with loitering if they were caught.</p>\n<p>The two officers were released without charges, but the incident prompted the president of the Massachusetts State Senate to threaten&mdash;only probably in jest&mdash;to declare war on New Hampshire. The arrests were part of a long-simmering conflict between New Hampshire and its neighboring states over sales tax collection. Following <em>Wayfair,</em> New Hampshire has been moving to fortify itself once again.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our retailers don't have the infrastructure set up to collect sales taxes,&quot; says Nancy C. Kyle, president of the New Hampshire Retailers Association. &quot;New Hampshire has chosen to balance its budget without the use of sales taxes, so making our businesses collect sales taxes for other states, that's just ludicrous.&quot;</p>\n<p>So while other states hurried to legalize out-of-state tax collections in the wake of the <em>Wayfair</em> ruling last year, New Hampshire's lawmakers were rushing to the barricades. Gov. Chris Sununu called the state legislature into a special session to create a legislative task force to address the <em>Wayfair</em> ruling and issued an executive order telling the Department of Justice to monitor for tax collection activities by other states against New Hampshire businesses. &quot;Our goal is basically to create every possible barrier that you can imagine, so that even if we are forced to do it, it would be really hard for any jurisdiction to try to do it,&quot; Sununu, a Republican, <a href=\"https://www.conwaydailysun.com/news/local/n-h-house-guts-senate-bill-opposing-wayfair-decision/article_f10e5780-8ba3-11e8-8011-532c94b383ec.html\">told</a> the <em>Conway Daily Sun</em> at the time<em>.</em></p>\n<p>The state also set up <a href=\"https://www.nheconomy.com/nosalestax\">a website</a> inviting businesses to report collection efforts&mdash;although the website is clear that the state will not represent New Hampshire-based businesses if they are targeted by out-of-state revenue hounds.</p>\n<p>&quot;You can't let one state impose its law on another state. That's my real concern,&quot; says state Rep. Betty Gay (R&ndash;Rockingham). She's sponsoring <a href=\"https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/1022739\">a bill</a> this year declaring the right of New Hampshire businesses to refuse to collect and remit sales tax to other states on the grounds that such a requirement would violate the state and federal constitution. Other bills would require out-of-state taxing authorities to comply with all New Hampshire revenue laws before being able to collect from in-state businesses, as well as force other states to reimburse New Hampshire businesses for any costs incurred.</p>\n<p>It might not require the physical arrest of revenue offices, but New Hampshire public officials are doing everything short of standing at the border and daring other states to try it.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's part of our identity, and it's part of how we survive as a state,&quot; says Gay. Forcing New Hampshire businesses to collect sales taxes for other states would be &quot;more than an inconvenience or an expense,&quot; she says. &quot;It would be cutting us off at the knees.&quot;</p>\n<p>They might get some help from Congress too. Last month, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) teamed up to introduce <a href=\"https://www.hassan.senate.gov/news/press-releases/shaheen-hassan-move-to-protect-new-hampshire-small-businesses-from-online-sales-tax-collection-requirement\">a bill</a> fully overturning the <em>Wayfair</em> ruling. Montana is another of the five states with no sales taxes (Alaska, Delaware, and Oregon are the other three).</p>\n<p>&quot;States like New Hampshire have a competitive advantage because of our lack of a sales or income tax,&quot; Hassan told <em>Reason.</em> &quot;I'm deeply concerned that the backward Supreme Court ruling would threaten that advantage or inhibit economic growth by requiring small businesses to collect internet sales tax for other states.&quot; It's familiar territory for Hassan. In 2009, as a member of the state House, she sponsored a bill to make it illegal for New Hampshire to share tax information with other states.</p>\n<p>&quot;There's something psychological about not having to pay a sales tax that people really enjoy. You have an 8 percent sale&mdash;no one is going to go to that. But to avoid paying the 8 percent sales tax, they'll drive up here to New Hampshire,&quot; says Kyle. &quot;They feel like they are sticking it to the government.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>&quot;It's Going to Be Just Horrendously Expensive&quot;</strong></p>\n<p>The days of paying no sales tax online in states like New Hampshire may feel good, but they are probably coming to an end. Even critics of the <em>Wayfair</em> ruling don't deny that the <em>Quill</em> decision&mdash;decided two years before Amazon.com existed, when mail order catalogs were the cutting edge of retail&mdash;was an anachronism. With e-commerce accounting for more than $500 billion in sales during 2018, and certain to keep growing, it was really only a matter of time before states convinced Congress or the courts to let them have a larger slice of that pie.</p>\n<p>It's up to Congress, then, to restrict overly aggressive state revenue departments, limit the confusion facing e-retailers of all sizes, and help small businesses that cannot afford the burden of dealing with hundreds of different taxing jurisdictions at once.</p>\n<p>&quot;It costs a lot just to have our accounting firm do our sales tax returns just for our home state of Wisconsin,&quot; says Heitman. &quot;If I start having them do all these individual tax returns for all these states it's going to be just horrendously expensive.&quot;</p>\n<p>State lawmakers and tax officials don't have much of an incentive to follow in New Hampshire's footsteps. In fact, the opposite is true. But even in the absence of federal legislation, state policymakers should be careful not to break the Golden Rule. &quot;Do unto residents of other states as you would have those states do to your residents,&quot; says Bartlett Cleland, a vice president of the American Legislative Exchange Council. In the rush to squeeze cash from other states, lawmakers might end up encouraging more aggressive raiding of their own businesses, he warns.</p>\n<p>That sounds a lot like what was happening during the Articles of Confederation. &quot;I think a lot of this is a failure to appreciate history,&quot; says Cleland. &quot;I don't think anybody is thinking about the very logical conclusions to these things.&quot;</p>\n<p>If states wrote simple, flat tax requirement for out-of-state retailers, Heitman says that would help. Illinois, for example, has a flat rate of 6 percent for online sales taxes, which at least does away with confusion over what items are subject to tax. Better, he says, would be a federal law that exempts the first $500,000 of sales into any state. That's the sales threshold that Texas set on January 1 when it announced it would start collecting taxes from remote sellers.</p>\n<p>Until that happens, Heitman will have to keep trying to figure out whether Connecticut taxes fireproof underwear. &quot;My wife, she can see that it's stressing me out. What do you do? Do you keep fighting it or just give up? I hate talking that way, but it's just frustrating.&quot;</p>",

                "text": "When he started selling race car equipment 40 years ago, Chris Heitman never imagined that he'd have to learn which states charge sales tax for fireproof underwear.\n\"Is it clothing? Is it specialized equipment? That's the question,\" he says. And since the answer isn't always clear, he errs on the side of charging the tax\u2014better to overcharge a customer than to face the wrath of the taxman, after all.\nHeitman and his wife, Carla, have been running Pegasus Auto Racing Supplies since they founded the company back in 1980, out of a two-story building in New Berlin, Wisconsin. Until last year, that meant Heitman was responsible for collecting and paying sales taxes to exactly one place: the Wisconsin Department of Revenue. But thanks to an under-the-radar ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court in June, he's now receiving letters, phone calls, and emails from revenue officials across the country, each wanting a piece of his business.\nThe source of Heitman's frustrations is Wayfair v. South Dakota, which allowed states to collect sales taxes from online businesses located beyond their borders. Many states view the Wayfair ruling as a potential tax revenue windfall in which the taxes are paid by non-residents who can't vote against them. That's why businesses like Heitman's are now facing the chilling prospect of owing taxes in dozens, and possibly hundreds, of different jurisdictions\u2014while being hounded by out-of-state tax collectors.\nSince the Supreme Court issued its ruling in June, Heitman has been scrambling to become compliant with tax commissions and revenue departments from coast to coast. He's spent thousands of dollars on new software to help navigate the complexities of state sales tax law, but that's only been so much help. \"It almost seems like I have another full time job dumped on me with this sales tax thing,\" he says. \"It's burning me out.\"\nAs the 2019 tax season begins, states are ramping up efforts to squeeze extra revenue out of remote retailers like Heitman, putting an expensive new burden on businesses that have found broad customer bases online. The burden is particularly large in the five U.S. states that charge no sales tax, where entrepreneurs could now be charged with paying a tax they have never had to pay before, to a government over which they have no voice. And while Congress could clean up the Supreme Court's mess, it's far from certain that it will.\nThe Supreme Court Overturns a Sales Tax Precedent\nThe question of whether states can charge taxes on out-of-state goods predates the U.S. Constitution. In fact, it's one of the primary reasons it came into being in 1787.\nThe Articles of Confederation allowed each state to set its own rules for cross-border trade, creating barriers to interstate commerce. The Constitution thus gave the federal government explicit control over interstate commerce. In Federalist 42, James Madison said this was necessary, because otherwise states \"would nourish unceasing animosities, and not improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public tranquility.\"\nIn the decades that followed, various Supreme Court rulings developed into a legal doctrine known as the \"dormant Commerce Clause.\" This assumes the Constitution forbids state-level policies that limit the free flow of commerce. That rationale was the basis of Quill Corp v. North Dakota, a 1992 Supreme Court ruling blocking North Dakota from collecting sales tax from a catalog-based office retailer that sold goods to other businesses in the state, but that did not have a physical location in North Dakota.\nLast year, South Dakota succeeded where North Dakota had failed. At the root of the Wayfair case was a South Dakota law claiming that the state had the authority to collect sales tax from any business that made at least 200 transactions or $100,000 in sales into South Dakota in a single year. The Supreme Court upheld that law, and ruled that the 1992 North Dakota ruling was \"unsound and incorrect,\" as Justice Anthony Kennedy put it in the majority opinion\u2014the last that he would author before retiring in July.\nThe earlier Quill ruling, he wrote, had become \"a judicially created tax shelter for businesses that decide to limit their physical presence and still sell their goods and services to a state's consumers\u2014something that has become easier and more prevalent as technology has advanced.\" The 5-4 majority cut across the Supreme Court's usual ideological lines, with Ruth Bader Ginsburg joining conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and the moderate Kennedy in support of South Dakota's law.\nThe court's liberal wing, minus Ginsburg, joined Chief Justice John Roberts' dissenting opinion, which largely agreed with Kennedy that Quill was decided incorrectly, but insisted it was Congress' duty to fix that problem.\n\"By suddenly changing the ground rules, the Court may have waylaid Congress' consideration of the issue,\" Roberts wrote. States had been petitioning Congress for years to change the rules for interstate sales taxes, but Roberts worried that an abrupt change of direction ordered by the courts would steer state efforts towards \"securing new tax revenue from remote sellers.\"\nA Ruling Both \"Sweeping and Vague\"\nIn the months since the Wayfair ruling, Roberts' concerns have been vindicated. The ruling was both \"sweeping and vague,\" says Andrew Moylan, vice president of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for lowering taxes. \"The result is that there's an enormous amount of gray area that states, businesses, and policy experts are trying to define in the face of very thin guidance from the Court.\"\nThe most important of those gray areas is the question of when a business is considered to have done enough business in a certain state to owe sales tax there. The South Dakota law that was the basis of the Wayfair case specifies a threshold of 200 transactions or $100,000 worth of sales. That's a high enough threshold to exempt most small businesses and online sellers from owing sales taxes to South Dakota. But using the same standards in a state with a lot more potential buyers\u2014California, for example, whose economy is more than 50 times larger than South Dakota's\u2014has the potential to ensnare many more businesses.\nWith no clear instruction from the federal government, states have quickly stepped up to fill in their own. Days after the ruling, lawmakers in New Jersey introduced a bill to hit out-of-state retailers with a 6.625 percent tax on sales into the state\u2014and state lawmakers touted the potential for it to generate more than $300 million in annual revenue.\nIn many cases, new legislation wasn't even required. In January, the New York Department of Taxation and Finance reinterpreted existing sales tax rules to cover any business that does more than $300,000 of gross sales in the state or made 100 transactions with New York customers. The California Department of Tax and Fee Administrators announced in December that remote sellers will owe taxes if they do more than $100,000 in California sales or have 200 transactions. The state expects to generate $500 million from those new collections. Most other states have made similar changes to their laws or tax codes, or are now considering such changes.\nIt's not just states. In many places, counties and cities have their own sales taxes applied on top of the state rate. In the 45 states with sales taxes, there are more than 12,000 tax jurisdictions, says Moylan. Although it is unlikely that a small business would do enough sales in that many locations to hit the sales tax threshold, it's not impossible. Heitman does enough sales in California that he worries he could be on the hook for taxes in some of those local jurisdiction too\u2014although he's not entirely sure.\n\"It almost seems like I have another full time job dumped on me with this sales tax thing. It's burning me out.\"\nDetermining where and what a business owes is its own burden, and the largest costs are born by medium-sized businesses like Heitmans. Bigger businesses are better able to handle the increased compliance costs created by Wayfair, and truly small businesses are unlikely to surpass the various sales thresholds to trigger tax collections\u2014but for those in the middle, the sudden shift in the playing field is \"hair-raising,\" says David Mittelstadt, a tax attorney from Chattanooga, Tennessee, and chairman of the Tennessee Bar Association's tax section.\nThe transaction limits are what will capture many of them, he predicts. \"Because, you know, 200 sales when you're selling industrial turbines is one thing,\" says Mittelstadt. \"If you're selling t-shirts, you could hit those thresholds at a very low volume of sales.\"\nThat's exactly what's facing Kenny Ballard, CEO of The Mountain, a New Hampshire-based company that sells T-shirts online\u2014including the internet-famous shirt featuring three wolves howling at the Moon. At approximately $25 per shirt, 200 sales into a certain state is a mere $5,000 in revenue for Ballard's company but would be enough to trigger tax obligations, cutting into profits and requiring new expenditures on reporting and compliance.\nFor business owners, the challenge isn't just determining if they owe, it's determining what. State sales tax codes are notoriously complex, and no two are exactly alike. In Pennsylvania, for example, most clothing is exempt from the state's 6 percent sales tax\u2014unless it is considered formalwear or recreational equipment. In practice, that means a pair of gloves would not be taxed, except if it's considered skiing equipment, in which case the exact same pair of gloves would be taxed. New York taxes Yoo-hoo, a milky, chocolatey drink\u2014but not chocolate milk. Coffee is not subject to sales tax in Colorado, but you will be charged tax if you get a to-go cup with a lid, which is considered \"nonessential packaging\" under state law.\nThat's why Heitman spends a lot of time thinking about the tax status of fireproof underwear, but he's hardly alone. Micro-retailers operating through marketplace sites like Etsy, for example, sell all variety of handmade items\u2014from homemade moccasins to unicorn fluff. Adding to the confusion, transactions of non-taxable goods in some states still count towards the overall transaction threshold that determines whether a seller has to pay taxes. Since the Wayfair ruling, Etsy has updated its seller handbook to keep users aware of the shifting playing fields, and the platform is now collecting and paying sales taxes on behalf of users in states where the laws have changed.\nFor small businesses operating outside of an online marketplace, software can help navigate the complexity of suddenly having to understand thousands of different tax codes. But it's only so useful, and it can be expensive. Heitman says he paid $6,000 for a program that calculates taxes owed based on buyers' ZIP codes, but it's also brought him additional frustration. \"Some of the addresses cannot be validated,\" he says, recalling an order that was shipped to a building at Newark Airport. The address was rejected because it was not in the U.S. Postal Service database. \"Apparently the Postal Service doesn't deliver there\u2014but this was a large package shipped by UPS.\"\n\"It's just ridiculously time-consuming every month,\" he says.\nA Problem Fixed by Software\u2014or Congress?\nIn writing the majority opinion in Wayfair, Justice Kennedy waved away some of Roberts' worries about how the court's abrupt overturning of the decades-old precedent would create chaos by pointing to the fact that computers could solve the mess\u2014or that they would, maybe.\n\"Eventually, software that is available at a reasonable cost may make it easier for small businesses to cope with these problems,\" he wrote. And if that doesn't fix it, he added with one of the all-time great hand-waves in Supreme Court history: \"In all events, Congress may legislate to address these problems if it deems it necessary and fit to do so.\"\nSo, will it?\nEven before Wayfair, there were good reasons for congressional action on an issue that fits very squarely within the enumerated power of the federal government to regulate interstate commerce. In the wake of last year's Supreme Court ruling, congressional involvement now seems both more urgently needed and less likely to happen.\nOne potential vehicle for resolving problems created by Wayfair is a bill sponsored by Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.), first introduced in October and likely to be re-introduced to the new session of Congress within the coming weeks. His bill, the Online Sales Simplicity and Small Business Relief Act, would add important specifics like prohibiting states from collecting out-of-state sales taxes on transactions that occurred before January 1, 2019, essentially giving businesses much-needed time to get up to speed on the new requirements without suddenly being hit with tax bills they weren't expecting.\nMost important of all, the bill would create a $10 million sales tax exemption for all small businesses that do not have a physical presence in a given state. That means upping the $100,000 threshold in the South Dakota law that triggered the Wayfair case to a level far in excess of what a small business would have in sales\u2014effectively removing the ability of states to target all but the largest of remote sellers.\n\"Small business owners, in particular, have shared fears that they will be unable to bear the new compliance burdens and may have to shutter their businesses,\" Sensenbrenner says. \"I've heard from online sellers in Wisconsin and across the country who are concerned with the complexity of the post-Wayfair tax regime.\"\nThe bill is likely to have bipartisan support in the House this year, with Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) lined up as co-sponsors, along with Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.).\nBut cities and states eyeing a windfall in new tax revenue are likely to organize against congressional action. Late last year, a coalition of groups including the Council of State Governments, National Association of Counties, and the United States Conference of Mayors sent a letter to Congress decrying efforts to \"undermine\" the Wayfair ruling.\nStates With No Sales Tax Fight Back\nWhile many states likely will work to keep the Wayfair ruling, a smaller group are already organizing to fight its effects. No state is likely to fight harder than New Hampshire, which has a long track record of defending its residents from out-of-state tax collection.\nIn December 1976, the New Hampshire State Police literally arrested two agents from the Massachusetts Tax Commission. The agents had been staking out a parking lot in the small town of Hinsdale, barely five miles north of the Massachusetts border, looking for Massachusetts license plates as part of an effort by other New England states to crack down on tax-free cross-border holiday shopping. Unhappy with other states targeting shoppers and businesses in New Hampshire, Gov. Meldrim Thomson told the state police to keep an eye out for revenue agents\u2014and to charge them with loitering if they were caught.\nThe two officers were released without charges, but the incident prompted the president of the Massachusetts State Senate to threaten\u2014only probably in jest\u2014to declare war on New Hampshire. The arrests were part of a long-simmering conflict between New Hampshire and its neighboring states over sales tax collection. Following Wayfair, New Hampshire has been moving to fortify itself once again.\n\"Our retailers don't have the infrastructure set up to collect sales taxes,\" says Nancy C. Kyle, president of the New Hampshire Retailers Association. \"New Hampshire has chosen to balance its budget without the use of sales taxes, so making our businesses collect sales taxes for other states, that's just ludicrous.\"\nSo while other states hurried to legalize out-of-state tax collections in the wake of the Wayfair ruling last year, New Hampshire's lawmakers were rushing to the barricades. Gov. Chris Sununu called the state legislature into a special session to create a legislative task force to address the Wayfair ruling and issued an executive order telling the Department of Justice to monitor for tax collection activities by other states against New Hampshire businesses. \"Our goal is basically to create every possible barrier that you can imagine, so that even if we are forced to do it, it would be really hard for any jurisdiction to try to do it,\" Sununu, a Republican, told the Conway Daily Sun at the time.\nThe state also set up a website inviting businesses to report collection efforts\u2014although the website is clear that the state will not represent New Hampshire-based businesses if they are targeted by out-of-state revenue hounds.\n\"You can't let one state impose its law on another state. That's my real concern,\" says state Rep. Betty Gay (R\u2013Rockingham). She's sponsoring a bill this year declaring the right of New Hampshire businesses to refuse to collect and remit sales tax to other states on the grounds that such a requirement would violate the state and federal constitution. Other bills would require out-of-state taxing authorities to comply with all New Hampshire revenue laws before being able to collect from in-state businesses, as well as force other states to reimburse New Hampshire businesses for any costs incurred.\nIt might not require the physical arrest of revenue offices, but New Hampshire public officials are doing everything short of standing at the border and daring other states to try it.\n\"It's part of our identity, and it's part of how we survive as a state,\" says Gay. Forcing New Hampshire businesses to collect sales taxes for other states would be \"more than an inconvenience or an expense,\" she says. \"It would be cutting us off at the knees.\"\nThey might get some help from Congress too. Last month, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) teamed up to introduce a bill fully overturning the Wayfair ruling. Montana is another of the five states with no sales taxes (Alaska, Delaware, and Oregon are the other three).\n\"States like New Hampshire have a competitive advantage because of our lack of a sales or income tax,\" Hassan told Reason. \"I'm deeply concerned that the backward Supreme Court ruling would threaten that advantage or inhibit economic growth by requiring small businesses to collect internet sales tax for other states.\" It's familiar territory for Hassan. In 2009, as a member of the state House, she sponsored a bill to make it illegal for New Hampshire to share tax information with other states.\n\"There's something psychological about not having to pay a sales tax that people really enjoy. You have an 8 percent sale\u2014no one is going to go to that. But to avoid paying the 8 percent sales tax, they'll drive up here to New Hampshire,\" says Kyle. \"They feel like they are sticking it to the government.\"\n\"It's Going to Be Just Horrendously Expensive\"\nThe days of paying no sales tax online in states like New Hampshire may feel good, but they are probably coming to an end. Even critics of the Wayfair ruling don't deny that the Quill decision\u2014decided two years before Amazon.com existed, when mail order catalogs were the cutting edge of retail\u2014was an anachronism. With e-commerce accounting for more than $500 billion in sales during 2018, and certain to keep growing, it was really only a matter of time before states convinced Congress or the courts to let them have a larger slice of that pie.\nIt's up to Congress, then, to restrict overly aggressive state revenue departments, limit the confusion facing e-retailers of all sizes, and help small businesses that cannot afford the burden of dealing with hundreds of different taxing jurisdictions at once.\n\"It costs a lot just to have our accounting firm do our sales tax returns just for our home state of Wisconsin,\" says Heitman. \"If I start having them do all these individual tax returns for all these states it's going to be just horrendously expensive.\"\nState lawmakers and tax officials don't have much of an incentive to follow in New Hampshire's footsteps. In fact, the opposite is true. But even in the absence of federal legislation, state policymakers should be careful not to break the Golden Rule. \"Do unto residents of other states as you would have those states do to your residents,\" says Bartlett Cleland, a vice president of the American Legislative Exchange Council. In the rush to squeeze cash from other states, lawmakers might end up encouraging more aggressive raiding of their own businesses, he warns.\nThat sounds a lot like what was happening during the Articles of Confederation. \"I think a lot of this is a failure to appreciate history,\" says Cleland. \"I don't think anybody is thinking about the very logical conclusions to these things.\"\nIf states wrote simple, flat tax requirement for out-of-state retailers, Heitman says that would help. Illinois, for example, has a flat rate of 6 percent for online sales taxes, which at least does away with confusion over what items are subject to tax. Better, he says, would be a federal law that exempts the first $500,000 of sales into any state. That's the sales threshold that Texas set on January 1 when it announced it would start collecting taxes from remote sellers.\nUntil that happens, Heitman will have to keep trying to figure out whether Connecticut taxes fireproof underwear. \"My wife, she can see that it's stressing me out. What do you do? Do you keep fighting it or just give up? I hate talking that way, but it's just frustrating.\"",

Mike Lee (R&ndash;Utah) whether or not he considered himself to be an originalist. &quot;Originalism refers to basically textualism applied in the constitutional sphere, with an eye toward identifying the original public meaning of the constitutional text at issue,&quot; Lee observed. So, &quot;for our purposes today,&quot; Lee asked the nominee, &quot;you're an originalist?&quot; &quot;That's correct,&quot; Kavanaugh promptly replied.</p>\n<p>Many fans of originalism were no doubt heartened by that answer. Unfortunately for them, Kavanaugh just flunked his first big test as an originalist on the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>The test came last week in the case of <em>Timbs v. Indiana</em>. The matter arose in 2013 when a man named Tyson Timbs was arrested on drug charges and sentenced to one year on home detention and five years on probation. A few months after his arrest, the state of Indiana also moved to seize Timbs' brand new Land Rover LR2, a vehicle worth around $40,000. But a state trial court rejected that civil asset forfeiture on the grounds that it would be &quot;grossly disproportionate to the gravity of [Timbs'] offense&quot; and therefore in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which forbids the imposition of &quot;excessive fines.&quot;</p>\n<p>The Indiana Supreme Court later reversed that judgment. &quot;We conclude the Excessive Fines Clause does not bar the State from forfeiting Defendant's vehicle because the United States Supreme Court has not held that the Clause applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,&quot; the state's high court said.</p>\n<p>The issue before the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Timbs v. Indiana</em>, therefore, was whether or not the Excessive Fines Clause should bind the states just as it binds the federal government. Since the late 19th century, the Supreme Court has been applying&mdash;or incorporating&mdash;the various provisions contained in the Bill of Rights against the states via the 14th Amendment, which says, &quot;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.&quot; The issue in <em>Timbs</em>, in other words, boiled down to this: if the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment applies against the states (it does), then the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment deserves the same treatment.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court agreed with that assessment and <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-1091_5536.pdf\">ruled unanimously</a> in favor of Tyson Timbs, holding that the Excessive Fines Clause does indeed apply against the states.</p>\n<p>But the Court was not unanimous in its reasoning. The majority opinion, written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh, held that the Excessive Fines Clause is &quot;incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.&quot;</p>\n<p>Writing separately, Justice Clarence Thomas explained that while he agreed that the ban on excessive fines should be applied against the states, he &quot;cannot agree,&quot; as a matter of originalism, &quot;with the route the Court takes to reach this conclusion. Instead of reading the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause to encompass a substantive right that has nothing to do with 'process,&quot; Thomas wrote, &quot;I would hold that the right to be free from excessive fines is one of the 'privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States' protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.&quot;</p>\n<p>This is not a new position from Thomas. In the 2010 case of <em>McDonald v. Chicago</em>, which asked whether the Second Amendment applied against the states, Thomas spelled out his originalist interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause in a lengthy concurring opinion. &quot;I believe the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment offers a superior alternative,&quot; Thomas wrote, &quot;and that a return to that meaning would allow this Court to enforce the rights that the Fourteenth Amendment is designed to protect with greater clarity and predictability than the substantive due process framework has so far managed.&quot; It is no surprise that Thomas re-upped that interpretation in <em>Timbs</em>.</p>\n<p>One key difference from 2010 is that Thomas now has a bit of company on the bench. &quot;As an original matter,&quot; Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote last week in his own solo <em>Timbs</em> concurrence, &quot;I acknowledge, the appropriate vehicle for incorporation may well be the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause, rather than, as this Court has long assumed, the Due Process Clause.&quot; But, because &quot;nothing in this case turns on that question,&quot; Gorsuch continued, he said he was willing to go along with the majority's non-originalist holding this time around.</p>\n<p>Thomas and Gorsuch are both self-avowed originalists, so it is fitting that they would either explain (Thomas) or at least acknowledge (Gorsuch) their heterodox views in a major constitutional case such as <em>Timbs</em>. For an originalist judge, it is often an uphill battle, and one of the best ways to gain ground in the war of ideas is by writing a persuasive opinion, typically penned in concurrence or dissent. How else are you going to change minds and set the foundation for winning future cases?</p>\n<p>Which brings us back to Brett Kavanaugh. Where, you may be wondering, was the Court's newest self-described originalist in last week's <em>Timbs</em> legal wrangling? Did Kavanaugh also explain where he stands on the <a href=\"https://reason.com/archives/2010/06/08/conservatives-v-libertarians\">crucial debate</a> over the original meaning of the 14th Amendment? Did he say whether or not he agrees with Thomas? Did he perhaps lay out a different originalist take of his own? Alas, Kavanaugh did none of those things. He did not bother to weigh in at all.</p>\n<p>If Brett Kavanaugh is a committed originalist, you would never know it based on his complacent behavior in <em>Timbs v. Indiana</em>.</p>",

                "text": "In his 2018 confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was asked by Sen. Mike Lee (R\u2013Utah) whether or not he considered himself to be an originalist. \"Originalism refers to basically textualism applied in the constitutional sphere, with an eye toward identifying the original public meaning of the constitutional text at issue,\" Lee observed. So, \"for our purposes today,\" Lee asked the nominee, \"you're an originalist?\" \"That's correct,\" Kavanaugh promptly replied.\nMany fans of originalism were no doubt heartened by that answer. Unfortunately for them, Kavanaugh just flunked his first big test as an originalist on the Supreme Court.\nThe test came last week in the case of Timbs v. Indiana. The matter arose in 2013 when a man named Tyson Timbs was arrested on drug charges and sentenced to one year on home detention and five years on probation. A few months after his arrest, the state of Indiana also moved to seize Timbs' brand new Land Rover LR2, a vehicle worth around $40,000. But a state trial court rejected that civil asset forfeiture on the grounds that it would be \"grossly disproportionate to the gravity of [Timbs'] offense\" and therefore in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which forbids the imposition of \"excessive fines.\"\nThe Indiana Supreme Court later reversed that judgment. \"We conclude the Excessive Fines Clause does not bar the State from forfeiting Defendant's vehicle because the United States Supreme Court has not held that the Clause applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,\" the state's high court said.\nThe issue before the U.S. Supreme Court in Timbs v. Indiana, therefore, was whether or not the Excessive Fines Clause should bind the states just as it binds the federal government. Since the late 19th century, the Supreme Court has been applying\u2014or incorporating\u2014the various provisions contained in the Bill of Rights against the states via the 14th Amendment, which says, \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The issue in Timbs, in other words, boiled down to this: if the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment applies against the states (it does), then the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment deserves the same treatment.\nThe Supreme Court agreed with that assessment and ruled unanimously in favor of Tyson Timbs, holding that the Excessive Fines Clause does indeed apply against the states.\nBut the Court was not unanimous in its reasoning. The majority opinion, written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh, held that the Excessive Fines Clause is \"incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\nWriting separately, Justice Clarence Thomas explained that while he agreed that the ban on excessive fines should be applied against the states, he \"cannot agree,\" as a matter of originalism, \"with the route the Court takes to reach this conclusion. Instead of reading the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause to encompass a substantive right that has nothing to do with 'process,\" Thomas wrote, \"I would hold that the right to be free from excessive fines is one of the 'privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States' protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\nThis is not a new position from Thomas. In the 2010 case of McDonald v. Chicago, which asked whether the Second Amendment applied against the states, Thomas spelled out his originalist interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause in a lengthy concurring opinion. \"I believe the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment offers a superior alternative,\" Thomas wrote, \"and that a return to that meaning would allow this Court to enforce the rights that the Fourteenth Amendment is designed to protect with greater clarity and predictability than the substantive due process framework has so far managed.\" It is no surprise that Thomas re-upped that interpretation in Timbs.\nOne key difference from 2010 is that Thomas now has a bit of company on the bench. \"As an original matter,\" Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote last week in his own solo Timbs concurrence, \"I acknowledge, the appropriate vehicle for incorporation may well be the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause, rather than, as this Court has long assumed, the Due Process Clause.\" But, because \"nothing in this case turns on that question,\" Gorsuch continued, he said he was willing to go along with the majority's non-originalist holding this time around.\nThomas and Gorsuch are both self-avowed originalists, so it is fitting that they would either explain (Thomas) or at least acknowledge (Gorsuch) their heterodox views in a major constitutional case such as Timbs. For an originalist judge, it is often an uphill battle, and one of the best ways to gain ground in the war of ideas is by writing a persuasive opinion, typically penned in concurrence or dissent. How else are you going to change minds and set the foundation for winning future cases?\nWhich brings us back to Brett Kavanaugh. Where, you may be wondering, was the Court's newest self-described originalist in last week's Timbs legal wrangling? Did Kavanaugh also explain where he stands on the crucial debate over the original meaning of the 14th Amendment? Did he say whether or not he agrees with Thomas? Did he perhaps lay out a different originalist take of his own? Alas, Kavanaugh did none of those things. He did not bother to weigh in at all.\nIf Brett Kavanaugh is a committed originalist, you would never know it based on his complacent behavior in Timbs v. Indiana.",

Some presumed the act was retaliatory&mdash;a response to Joly's successful campaign to persuade the government of Jackson, Michigan, to adopt an anti-discrimination law, for which a local newspaper declared him &quot;Citizen of the Year.&quot;</p>\n<p>Now the police finally have a suspect in custody: Joly.</p>\n<p>Police have long suspected that Joly set the fire himself, though it took a while to collect sufficient evidence. <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/02/25/gay-rights-leader-accused-burning-down-home/2816523002/?fbclid=IwAR2MCzuQ3ZfBa5RHCN1UQfOxUIfEedxneM2gWM5eDR65Ggdg_XYTZ4Mx2VA\">According to <em>The Detroit News</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p> Joly told [police] that, on the morning of the fire, he bought $10 of gas at a Marathon station so he could cut his grass. He began to mow, but it got too hot so he stopped with the backyard half done.</p><p>He went to work at the church and got a call from Moore at 1:02 p.m., said the report. Moore had forgotten to pack her lunch so asked Joly to bring it to her at work. The couple share one car.</p><p>Joly returned home, which was two miles away, went inside for a minute or two, and left, he told police.</p><p>The fire was reported by neighbors at 1:16 p.m.</p><p>The sequence of events would have made it difficult for anyone but Joly to set the fire, Grove said in the police report.</p><p>&quot;The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being scene,&quot; wrote Grove.</p><p>Joly told an insurance company investigator the arsonist must have been in the home at the same time he was, according to the report.</p><p>Lab tests by police found traces of gasoline on the clothes Joly was wearing on the day of the fire, said the report.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Joly didn't own the house, and thus did not collect any insurance money from it. He did receive more than $58,000 in donations, however. He may have suggested to friends that he was upset about the diminished attention being paid to his advocacy in the wake of the anti-discrimination law's passage&mdash;a possible motive, according to the police.</p>\n<p>The authorities investigated a second suspect&mdash;a man who was angry about the anti-discrimination ordinance&mdash;but determined that he could not have been at the scene of the crime during the window of time in which the fire was set.</p>\n<p>Just because Joly has been charged does not mean he is guilty, of course. He is entitled to due process and a presumption of innocence. Many in his community refuse to believe he could have played a role in the fire, given that it killed his five pets. Other former supporters of Joly's now believe they were duped, however.</p>\n<p>&quot;I feel as though I was used for a money scam,&quot; said Jeff Graves, a drag queen who helped solicit donations for Joly after the house burned down. &quot;It hurt and it still does.&quot;</p>\n<p>News of this suspected hate crime hoax comes amidst the unraveling of the Jussie Smollett attack: The <em>Empire</em> actor claimed he was assaulted by two men, racist homophobes, who shouted &quot;this is MAGA country&quot; as they doused him in bleach and put a rope around his neck. Police now suspect Smollett hired the men to fake the attack, and have charged the actor with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.</p>\n<p>The existence of two high-profile hate crime hoaxes&mdash;neither of them yet proven in a court of law&mdash;should not be used to discredit every alleged hate crime. But this news does provide a timely reminder that many stories are more complicated than they first seem. Self-described victims should be greeted with support and sympathy, not automatic belief that they must be telling the truth. Sometimes, they're not.</p>\n<p>And, as <em>Reason</em>'s <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/02/22/america-is-not-as-racist-as-jussie-smoll\">Nick Gillespie</a>, <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/02/22/hate-crimes-and-human-trafficking\">Elizabeth Nolan Brown</a>, <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/02/18/jussie-smollett-hate-crime-hoax-empire\">and I</a> have all observed in recent articles, there just isn't a lot of evidence to support the idea that hate crimes are growing more prevalent.</p>",

                "text": "In 2017, prominent Michigan LGBT activist Nikki Joly, a transgender man, was the victim of an apparent hate crime: An unknown arsonist burned down his house, which had two dogs and three cats trapped inside. Some presumed the act was retaliatory\u2014a response to Joly's successful campaign to persuade the government of Jackson, Michigan, to adopt an anti-discrimination law, for which a local newspaper declared him \"Citizen of the Year.\"\nNow the police finally have a suspect in custody: Joly.\nPolice have long suspected that Joly set the fire himself, though it took a while to collect sufficient evidence. According to The Detroit News:\nJoly told [police] that, on the morning of the fire, he bought $10 of gas at a Marathon station so he could cut his grass. He began to mow, but it got too hot so he stopped with the backyard half done.\nHe went to work at the church and got a call from Moore at 1:02 p.m., said the report. Moore had forgotten to pack her lunch so asked Joly to bring it to her at work. The couple share one car.\nJoly returned home, which was two miles away, went inside for a minute or two, and left, he told police.\nThe fire was reported by neighbors at 1:16 p.m.\nThe sequence of events would have made it difficult for anyone but Joly to set the fire, Grove said in the police report.\n\"The timeline shows a window of less than five minutes for another person to enter the residence, splash gasoline around, ignite the fire and then leave without being scene,\" wrote Grove.\nJoly told an insurance company investigator the arsonist must have been in the home at the same time he was, according to the report.\nLab tests by police found traces of gasoline on the clothes Joly was wearing on the day of the fire, said the report.\nJoly didn't own the house, and thus did not collect any insurance money from it. He did receive more than $58,000 in donations, however. He may have suggested to friends that he was upset about the diminished attention being paid to his advocacy in the wake of the anti-discrimination law's passage\u2014a possible motive, according to the police.\nThe authorities investigated a second suspect\u2014a man who was angry about the anti-discrimination ordinance\u2014but determined that he could not have been at the scene of the crime during the window of time in which the fire was set.\nJust because Joly has been charged does not mean he is guilty, of course. He is entitled to due process and a presumption of innocence. Many in his community refuse to believe he could have played a role in the fire, given that it killed his five pets. Other former supporters of Joly's now believe they were duped, however.\n\"I feel as though I was used for a money scam,\" said Jeff Graves, a drag queen who helped solicit donations for Joly after the house burned down. \"It hurt and it still does.\"\nNews of this suspected hate crime hoax comes amidst the unraveling of the Jussie Smollett attack: The Empire actor claimed he was assaulted by two men, racist homophobes, who shouted \"this is MAGA country\" as they doused him in bleach and put a rope around his neck. Police now suspect Smollett hired the men to fake the attack, and have charged the actor with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report.\nThe existence of two high-profile hate crime hoaxes\u2014neither of them yet proven in a court of law\u2014should not be used to discredit every alleged hate crime. But this news does provide a timely reminder that many stories are more complicated than they first seem. Self-described victims should be greeted with support and sympathy, not automatic belief that they must be telling the truth. Sometimes, they're not.\nAnd, as Reason's Nick Gillespie, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, and I have all observed in recent articles, there just isn't a lot of evidence to support the idea that hate crimes are growing more prevalent.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D&ndash;N.Y.)&mdash;has been controversial since it was <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5729033/Green-New-Deal-FINAL.pdf\">released</a> earlier this month. Several Democratic presidential candidates <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2020-democrats-jump-to-endorse-green-new-deal-despite-spending-hundreds-of-thousands-on-air-travel-including-private-jets\">endorsed</a> it, while others have noted that it's not realistic and would be fiscally impossible.</p>\n<p>How much would it cost? At least $50 trillion and possibly in excess of $90 trillion, according to a <a href=\"https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-green-new-deal-scope-scale-and-implications/\">report</a> released today by the American Action Forum (AAF).</p>\n<p>The AAF, a center-right think tank that focuses on economic issues, projected costs for six aspects of the Green New Deal: reworking the electricity grid in an environmentally friendly manner, revamping the nation's transportation network to reduce transmissions, and its guarantees of well-paying jobs, universal health care, affordable housing, and food security for each person in the U.S.</p>\n<p>First, the power grid. One of the Green New Deal's goals is to meet &quot;100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources&quot; in the next 10 years. Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in this area would cost at least $5.4 trillion by 2029, the AAF says&mdash;not including another $387 billion per year for things like operations and maintenance.</p>\n<p>Why so much? The study explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p> We assume that states without nuclear moratoriums build approximately 50 percent of their needed capacity with nuclear power, and cover the remaining 50 percent with wind, solar, hydro, geothermal electricity, and battery storage. States with nuclear moratoriums are assumed to replace fossil fuels with wind, solar, and storage. This approach raises issues in dispatching electricity, because one needs to cover the difference between available nuclear and peak capacity with both solar and wind resources. Most renewable resources are non-dispatchable, and must be supplemented by storage and other available assets.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This estimate is not an outlier. As <em>Reason</em>'s Ron Bailey has <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2017/06/21/powering-us-using-100-percent-renewable\">noted</a>, a similar plan outlined in 2015 would have cost roughly $7 trillion, while a previous version of that proposal might have cost up to $13 trillion.</p>\n<p>For comparison, the electric industry pulled in roughly $390 billion in revenue in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table3.pdf\">according</a> to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Around <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/images/charts/major_comp_average_elec_price-large.jpg\">59 percent</a> of that was accounted for by &quot;generation&quot; costs. Assuming that $230 billion rose to the aforementioned $387 billion, then subtracting $70.5 billion in annual &quot;avoided fuel costs&quot; from the net difference, total electricity costs would go up by 22 percent for consumers, the AAF says. Residential customers, who paid an <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf\">average</a> of $111.67 per month in 2017, would pay an average of about $300 more per year for electricity. This does not include the trillions it would cost to achieve a completely clean power grid in the first place.</p>\n<p>The Green New Deal also proposes &quot;overhauling transportation systems&hellip;to eliminate pollution and 19 greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible.&quot; The AAF's estimate of the cost for this proposal assumes that high-speed trains would replace air travel. While this is not specifically noted in the Green New Deal itself, an <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5729035/Green-New-Deal-FAQ.pdf\">overview</a> of the resolution that was apparently published by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/climate/green-new-deal-faq.html\">mistake</a> did <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/02/07/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-green-new-deal\">include</a> the goal of &quot;build[ing] out highspeed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.&quot;</p>\n<p>Doing so would cost between $1.3 trillion and $2.7 trillion, the AAF estimates. The lower figure can be reached by multiplying the 2018 proposed capital cost per mile of California's since-toned-down high-speed rail system ($129.8 million) by 8,263 miles, which is the difference between the number of miles covered by transit rail and by airports in the U.S., as of <a href=\"https://www.bts.gov/archive/publications/passenger_travel_2015/chapter3/table3_1\">2013</a>. Then add on another $166.9 billion for the trains themselves, which in California would have cost about $71.2 million. The higher figure, meanwhile, &quot;assumes replacing all [19,453] air route miles without using existing track,&quot; the report says. (There are other reasons why replacing air travel with high-speed rail doesn't make sense, which I outlined <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/02/07/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-green-new-deal\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>The Green New Deal's jobs guarantee would also cost a considerable amount. The AAF based its estimates here on a 2018 <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/full-employment/the-federal-job-guarantee-a-policy-to-achieve-permanent-full-employment\">report</a> from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, which found that reaching full employment would involve putting roughly 10.7 million unemployed or underemployed people to work. Assuming the average annual cost per job (including an average wage of $32,500) would be $56,000, this would cost a total of $543 billion.</p>\n<p>The AAF updated some of those numbers with 2019 data, and found that a federal jobs guarantee would cost $547 billion in 2019, and $6.762 trillion from 2020 to 2019. Both of those numbers would rise if, with a guaranteed job waiting for them, many of those who aren't currently looking for work decide to join the labor force.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are also plenty of workers who earn less than $32,500 per year (or $625 each week) who would naturally want to switch jobs in order to make more. Including them &quot;would increase the cost to $3.8 trillion in 2019, $44.6 trillion between 2020 and 2029,&quot; the AAF says.</p>\n<p>The report also estimates that providing universal health care &quot;will cost roughly $36 trillion between 2020 and 2029.&quot; The AAF simply built off a 2016 estimate of Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I&ndash;Vt.) Medicare for All Plan, which the Center for Health and Economy <a href=\"https://healthandeconomy.org/medicare-for-all-leaving-no-one-behind/\">said</a> would cost $34.67 trillion over 10 years. It's likely an accurate projection, roughly in line with a July 2018 Mercatus Center <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/commentary/medicare-all-plan-would-cost-federal-government-32-trillion\">report</a>, which said Medicare for All would cost the federal government more than $32 trillion over 10 years.</p>\n<p>Whether those in favor of the plan care about the cost is another question. Asked on CNN yesterday about the Green New Deal's massive price tag, particularly for Medicare for All, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D&ndash;Calif.) <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/kamala-harris-asked-on-cnn-if-america-can-afford-expensive-green-new-deal-its-not-about-cost/\">suggested</a> that &quot;it's not about a cost.&quot;</p>\n<p>The fifth aspect of the Green New Deal that AAF addresses is its guarantee of &quot;affordable, safe, and adequate housing.&quot; Simply housing the homeless could cost under $12 billion, AAF estimates, citing Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) data. But the Green New Deal also calls for &quot;upgrading all existing buildings in the 19 United States and building new buildings to achieve maximal energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability, including through electrification.&quot; This could cost trillions, as AAF explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p> A 2012 HUD <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/publications/pdf/evaluation_of_affordablehousing.pdf\">study</a> evaluated the costs involved in having affordable housing meet the &quot;National Green Building Standard.&quot; The results varied across a series of case studies and efficiency levels. Assuming the highest level (&quot;Emerald&quot;) is a reasonable proxy for a GND rubric, upfront improvement costs ranged from $13,257 to $34,422 per unit. Applying such costs to simply the 5 million currently available HUD-subsidized housing units yields a cost range of between $66.5 billion to $172.8 billion. Applying such costs to all <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data/interactive/ahstablecreator.html#?s_areas=a00000&s_year=n2017&s_tableName=Table1&s_byGroup1=a1&s_byGroup2=a1&s_filterGroup1=t1&s_filterGroup2=g1&s_show=S\">housing units</a>&mdash;since the resolution calls for upgrading &quot;all existing buildings&quot;&mdash;yields a potential cost of $1.6 trillion to nearly $4.2 trillion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the AAF calculated how much it would cost to ensure that all Americans have food security. Since 2011, the federal government's Healthy Food Financing Initiative has secured about $245 million in taxpayer money. Assuming, based off data from a Pennsylvania food access initiative, that it would cost $75 to improve food access for the 23.5 million people who needed it as of 2009, the AAF said such a program would cost $1.76 billion. Since taxpayers have already put in $245 million, we're left with a remainder of roughly $1.5 billion. &quot;This increased access to fresh food, in conjunction with the income guarantees provided elsewhere in the GND, should meet the plan's goal of food security for all Americans,&quot; the AAF says.</p>\n<p>All told, implementing the Green New Deal would cost untold trillions.

                "text": "The Green New Deal\u2014a brainchild of progressive Democrats, particularly Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D\u2013N.Y.)\u2014has been controversial since it was released earlier this month. Several Democratic presidential candidates endorsed it, while others have noted that it's not realistic and would be fiscally impossible.\nHow much would it cost? At least $50 trillion and possibly in excess of $90 trillion, according to a report released today by the American Action Forum (AAF).\nThe AAF, a center-right think tank that focuses on economic issues, projected costs for six aspects of the Green New Deal: reworking the electricity grid in an environmentally friendly manner, revamping the nation's transportation network to reduce transmissions, and its guarantees of well-paying jobs, universal health care, affordable housing, and food security for each person in the U.S.\nFirst, the power grid. One of the Green New Deal's goals is to meet \"100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources\" in the next 10 years. Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in this area would cost at least $5.4 trillion by 2029, the AAF says\u2014not including another $387 billion per year for things like operations and maintenance.\nWhy so much? The study explains:\nWe assume that states without nuclear moratoriums build approximately 50 percent of their needed capacity with nuclear power, and cover the remaining 50 percent with wind, solar, hydro, geothermal electricity, and battery storage. States with nuclear moratoriums are assumed to replace fossil fuels with wind, solar, and storage. This approach raises issues in dispatching electricity, because one needs to cover the difference between available nuclear and peak capacity with both solar and wind resources. Most renewable resources are non-dispatchable, and must be supplemented by storage and other available assets.\nThis estimate is not an outlier. As Reason's Ron Bailey has noted, a similar plan outlined in 2015 would have cost roughly $7 trillion, while a previous version of that proposal might have cost up to $13 trillion.\nFor comparison, the electric industry pulled in roughly $390 billion in revenue in 2017, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Around 59 percent of that was accounted for by \"generation\" costs. Assuming that $230 billion rose to the aforementioned $387 billion, then subtracting $70.5 billion in annual \"avoided fuel costs\" from the net difference, total electricity costs would go up by 22 percent for consumers, the AAF says. Residential customers, who paid an average of $111.67 per month in 2017, would pay an average of about $300 more per year for electricity. This does not include the trillions it would cost to achieve a completely clean power grid in the first place.\nThe Green New Deal also proposes \"overhauling transportation systems\u2026to eliminate pollution and 19 greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible.\" The AAF's estimate of the cost for this proposal assumes that high-speed trains would replace air travel. While this is not specifically noted in the Green New Deal itself, an overview of the resolution that was apparently published by mistake did include the goal of \"build[ing] out highspeed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.\"\nDoing so would cost between $1.3 trillion and $2.7 trillion, the AAF estimates. The lower figure can be reached by multiplying the 2018 proposed capital cost per mile of California's since-toned-down high-speed rail system ($129.8 million) by 8,263 miles, which is the difference between the number of miles covered by transit rail and by airports in the U.S., as of 2013. Then add on another $166.9 billion for the trains themselves, which in California would have cost about $71.2 million. The higher figure, meanwhile, \"assumes replacing all [19,453] air route miles without using existing track,\" the report says. (There are other reasons why replacing air travel with high-speed rail doesn't make sense, which I outlined here.)\nThe Green New Deal's jobs guarantee would also cost a considerable amount. The AAF based its estimates here on a 2018 report from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, which found that reaching full employment would involve putting roughly 10.7 million unemployed or underemployed people to work. Assuming the average annual cost per job (including an average wage of $32,500) would be $56,000, this would cost a total of $543 billion.\nThe AAF updated some of those numbers with 2019 data, and found that a federal jobs guarantee would cost $547 billion in 2019, and $6.762 trillion from 2020 to 2019. Both of those numbers would rise if, with a guaranteed job waiting for them, many of those who aren't currently looking for work decide to join the labor force.\nOf course, there are also plenty of workers who earn less than $32,500 per year (or $625 each week) who would naturally want to switch jobs in order to make more. Including them \"would increase the cost to $3.8 trillion in 2019, $44.6 trillion between 2020 and 2029,\" the AAF says.\nThe report also estimates that providing universal health care \"will cost roughly $36 trillion between 2020 and 2029.\" The AAF simply built off a 2016 estimate of Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I\u2013Vt.) Medicare for All Plan, which the Center for Health and Economy said would cost $34.67 trillion over 10 years. It's likely an accurate projection, roughly in line with a July 2018 Mercatus Center report, which said Medicare for All would cost the federal government more than $32 trillion over 10 years.\nWhether those in favor of the plan care about the cost is another question. Asked on CNN yesterday about the Green New Deal's massive price tag, particularly for Medicare for All, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D\u2013Calif.) suggested that \"it's not about a cost.\"\nThe fifth aspect of the Green New Deal that AAF addresses is its guarantee of \"affordable, safe, and adequate housing.\" Simply housing the homeless could cost under $12 billion, AAF estimates, citing Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) data. But the Green New Deal also calls for \"upgrading all existing buildings in the 19 United States and building new buildings to achieve maximal energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability, including through electrification.\" This could cost trillions, as AAF explains:\nA 2012 HUD study evaluated the costs involved in having affordable housing meet the \"National Green Building Standard.\" The results varied across a series of case studies and efficiency levels. Assuming the highest level (\"Emerald\") is a reasonable proxy for a GND rubric, upfront improvement costs ranged from $13,257 to $34,422 per unit. Applying such costs to simply the 5 million currently available HUD-subsidized housing units yields a cost range of between $66.5 billion to $172.8 billion. Applying such costs to all housing units\u2014since the resolution calls for upgrading \"all existing buildings\"\u2014yields a potential cost of $1.6 trillion to nearly $4.2 trillion.\nFinally, the AAF calculated how much it would cost to ensure that all Americans have food security. Since 2011, the federal government's Healthy Food Financing Initiative has secured about $245 million in taxpayer money. Assuming, based off data from a Pennsylvania food access initiative, that it would cost $75 to improve food access for the 23.5 million people who needed it as of 2009, the AAF said such a program would cost $1.76 billion. Since taxpayers have already put in $245 million, we're left with a remainder of roughly $1.5 billion. \"This increased access to fresh food, in conjunction with the income guarantees provided elsewhere in the GND, should meet the plan's goal of food security for all Americans,\" the AAF says.\nAll told, implementing the Green New Deal would cost untold trillions.

Kamala Harris (D&ndash;Ca.) announced her 2020 presidential campaign, she's <a href=\"https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/kamala-harris-sex-workers/\">been</a> <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/59xzj5/sex-workers-dont-trust-kamala-harris-backpage-fosta-sesta\">criticized</a> by sex workers, activists, and media over her long history of advocating policies that harm sex workers. That includes the shutdown of websites where sex workers advertise, <a href=\"https://reason.com/archives/2018/08/21/backpage-founders-larkin-and-lacey-speak\">like Backpage.com</a>, and the <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/02/14/fighting-fosta-in-2019\">disastrous 2018 law, FOSTA</a>, that made hosting web content that &quot;facilitates prostitution&quot; a federal crime.</p>\n<p>Now, Harris appears to be trying to counter that critique by suggesting that she would be open to the decriminalization of prostitution.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/exclusive-kamala-harris-calls-for-decriminalization-of-1832883951\">video interview with <em>The Root</em></a> published today, Terrell J. Starr asked Harris about her support for FOSTA despite <a href=\"https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/ev8ayz/trans-sex-workers-on-life-under-fosta-sesta\">sex workers saying</a> that it puts their lives in danger. Instead of answering, Harris pivoted to her history as a prosecutor. Harris claimed that all the way back in 2004, as district attorney for San Francisco, she was insisting &quot;that we have to stop arresting these prostitutes.&quot;</p>\n<p>However, as Harris pointed out, she also supported an increase in crackdowns on &quot;johns,&quot; a.k.a. the clients of sex workers. This is what's known as the &quot;<a href=\"https://reason.com/archives/2014/07/20/prostitution-views-go-neo-victorian\">Nordic Model</a>&quot; or the &quot;<a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/07/legalized-prostitution-theres-no-way-to-end-demand-for-sex-work-so-why-are-sweden-and-canada-trying.html\">End Demand</a>&quot; strategy. It's focused on arresting people who pay for sex but not those offering paid sex. Both sex workers and human rights groups like Amnesty International <a href=\"https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/false-promise-end-demand-laws\">oppose this strategy.</a></p>\n<p>Under the Nordic Model, sex workers are still subjected to police surveillance, stings, and raids meant to catch their customers. Meanwhile, crackdowns make customers more squeamish about sex-worker screening practices and other measures that can help keep them safe. That perpetuates the need for third-party involvement that at best cuts into potential earnings and independence, and can result in exactly the kinds of exploitative and controlling situations that End Demand advocates say they're fighting.</p>\n<p>FOSTA and federal crackdowns on advertising platforms <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-workers-sesta-fosta_us_5ad0d7d0e4b0edca2cb964d9\">also create these problematic conditions</a>.

                "text": "Since Sen. Kamala Harris (D\u2013Ca.) announced her 2020 presidential campaign, she's been criticized by sex workers, activists, and media over her long history of advocating policies that harm sex workers. That includes the shutdown of websites where sex workers advertise, like Backpage.com, and the disastrous 2018 law, FOSTA, that made hosting web content that \"facilitates prostitution\" a federal crime.\nNow, Harris appears to be trying to counter that critique by suggesting that she would be open to the decriminalization of prostitution.\nIn a video interview with The Root published today, Terrell J. Starr asked Harris about her support for FOSTA despite sex workers saying that it puts their lives in danger. Instead of answering, Harris pivoted to her history as a prosecutor. Harris claimed that all the way back in 2004, as district attorney for San Francisco, she was insisting \"that we have to stop arresting these prostitutes.\"\nHowever, as Harris pointed out, she also supported an increase in crackdowns on \"johns,\" a.k.a. the clients of sex workers. This is what's known as the \"Nordic Model\" or the \"End Demand\" strategy. It's focused on arresting people who pay for sex but not those offering paid sex. Both sex workers and human rights groups like Amnesty International oppose this strategy.\nUnder the Nordic Model, sex workers are still subjected to police surveillance, stings, and raids meant to catch their customers. Meanwhile, crackdowns make customers more squeamish about sex-worker screening practices and other measures that can help keep them safe. That perpetuates the need for third-party involvement that at best cuts into potential earnings and independence, and can result in exactly the kinds of exploitative and controlling situations that End Demand advocates say they're fighting.\nFOSTA and federal crackdowns on advertising platforms also create these problematic conditions. Online ad platforms, escort-review forums, hookup apps, and other staples of the digital era allowed people to engage in sex work without middlemen, to screen customers, and otherwise to take control of their working conditions in unprecedented numbers. Without these digital tools, people aren't abandoning sex work. Victims aren't suddenly safe and free. And police have lost a valuable method for helping them find and prosecute the cases of actual abuse and exploitation.\nIf Harris and law enforcement authorities want to target bad actors who exploit these tools to commit harm, they should target the bad actors themselves, not go after online venues that vastly more people use to positive effect. Harris supported FOSTA and targeted Backpage, twice, but was stopped by a judge both times. In the process, she supported actions that disproportionately punish the vast majority of users who fall into the \"consenting adult\" category Harris claims she doesn't want to target.\nEventually, in The Root interview, Starr asks Harris outright if she thinks \"sex work should be decriminialized.\"\n\"I think so,\" Harris replied. \"I do. I think that we have to understand though that it is not as simple as that.\"\nHarris reiterated that people who do harm in the commercial sex arena should still be punished. That's certainly true, but that's not what's on the table. Advocates for ending the illegal status of prostitution aren't arguing that people who use violence, fraud, threats, or teenagers in sexual activity should be decriminalized.\nBut this is a space full of weasely language, and it's common to find people professing that they only want to go after those who engage in exploitation and harm, yet include in those categories any person who simply pays for sex or for sex-related activities.\nBefore the interview moved on, Harris told Starr \"we should really consider that we can't criminalize consensual behavior.\" Harris has a worrying track record on this issue, but I'm glad to hear she's at least considering it.\nProstitution isn't a federal crime, so this actually comes down to reforming local and state laws. There's currently a push for decriminalization in New York, and hopefully more to follow elsewhere. Getting support from high-profile politicians like Harris could go a long way, so let's hope this nod of support from her wasn't just a fluke\u2014and that more 2020 candidates will follow her lead.",

Some of them were never even arrested.</p>\n<p>Those numbers&mdash;the result of new reporting requirements passed by the state in 2015&mdash;have spurred a bipartisan push among Michigan lawmakers to further restrict the practice of civil asset forfeiture, which allows police to seize cash and property suspected of being connected to criminal activity, even if the owner is never convicted, <a href=\"https://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/no-arrest-but-cops-took-and-kept-his-2035-anyway\">or sometimes never charged</a>, with a crime.</p>\n<p>The Michigan Senate <a href=\"https://www.michiganradio.org/post/state-senate-passes-bill-civil-asset-forfeiture\">passed</a> a civil asset forfeiture reform bill last week that would require police to obtain a criminal conviction to seize assets valued under $50,000, or consent from the owner to relinquish the property. The bill is now being considered by the state house.</p>\n<p>Jarrett Skorup, a researcher at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a free-market think tank, used a public records request to get the underlying data the state used to prepare its annual reports. Skorup's data showed that in 2017, the latest year for which information is available, Michigan police seized $13 million in cash and property&mdash;everything ranging from guns to TVs to Playstation 4s to grow lights for marijuana. Bowling balls, jumper cables, power tools, and Beats headphones also made the list.</p>\n<p>Those spreadsheets also showed that police, particularly in Wayne County, Michigan, seized thousands of cars in 2017 under the auspices of marijuana enforcement. Of the more than 2,500 vehicles seized, 473 were not accompanied by a criminal conviction, and in 438 of those cases, no one was even charged with a crime, according to Skorup's data. In 10 cases, the cars were seized under suspicion of a drug violation, even though the records say police didn't find any drugs.</p>\n<p>&quot;The vehicles are worth very little, typically around $1,000 or $2,000,&quot; Skorup says. &quot;These are very likely low-income people, people that can't afford to sit around without a vehicle for three weeks or afford an attorney to go challenge it.&quot;</p>\n<p>Wayne County prosecutors <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2018/07/20/michigan-man-files-civil-rights-suit-aft\">typically offer to settle</a> such forfeiture cases and return the owner's car for a $900 payment. The alternative is paying out-of-pocket to hire an attorney and fight the forfeiture case, which in many cases would likely exceed the estimated worth of the car.</p>\n<p>The Wayne County Sheriff's Office <a href=\"http://komornlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Section_902_Medical_Marihuana_Grant_Report_540026_7.pdf\">reported</a> in 2016 that it surveilled 32 medical marijuana dispensaries, performed 634 investigatory stops of cars leaving dispensaries, and impounded 467 vehicles as part of Operation Push-Off, a local law enforcement initiative targeting drugs, prostitution, and drag racing funded by licensing fees collected from the state's medical marijuana program.</p>\n<p>It all adds up to big money for local law enforcement. According to state <a href=\"http://komornlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FY_2016_Section_902_Medical_Marijuana_Grants_Money_by_County_505157_7.pdf\">reports</a>, Wayne County law enforcement received $473,256 in Medical Marihuana Operation and Oversight Grants in fiscal year 2016 and $483,132 in 2017.</p>\n<p>As <em>Reason</em> <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2018/12/07/detroit-woman-files-lawsuit-after-her-ca\">reported</a>, Wayne County's asset forfeiture program is now the subject of a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by a woman whose car was seized after Wayne County Sheriff's deputies found $10 worth of marijuana in it. The suit claims the seizure and settlement fee were a violation of the Eighth Amendment's protections against excessive fines and fees. (The Supreme Court <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2019/02/20/supreme-court-rules-that-excessive-fines\">unanimously ruled</a> earlier this week, in the case of Indiana man challenging the forfeiture of his Land Rover, that the Eighth Amendment applies to states.)</p>\n<p>Michigan law enforcement is pushing back against the reform efforts.

The state of Michigan can seize your property without a conviction. Any of you can go to small claims court today and get an order to seize somebody's else's property without a conviction.&quot;</p>\n<p>But others in the state who have watched the practice expand support the bill, such as Ted Nelson, a now-retired Michigan State Police officer who used to train police across the state on how to use civil asset forfeiture.</p>\n<p>When Nelson was training law enforcement, he says he emphasized that civil asset forfeiture was supposed to be used only against the direct proceeds of illegal drug sales, and that money was supposed to only fund narcotics enforcement.</p>\n<p>Two changes to Michigan law, Nelson says, &quot;opened the floodgates&quot; for civil asset forfeiture in the state. in 2008, Michigan legalized medical marijuana, and police began zealously going after violators&mdash;and their property, no matter how loosely connected to drug sales&mdash;for forfeiture. Then in 2011, Michigan removed the requirement that forfeiture revenue only fund narcotics enforcement, allowing it to be used for general police budgets with minimal oversight.</p>\n<p>&quot;Going around the state and listening to people, [police] were seizing things like money out of birthday cards and lawnmowers, which to me went against the proceeds aspect,&quot; Nelson says. &quot;To me, it's not the same thing.&quot;</p>\n<p>In one case, Nelson says police seized a man and woman's property because their son was growing marijuana close to their house.</p>\n<p>&quot;It led [police] to push the law to the edges of what they could do,&quot; Nelson continued. &quot;It could be easily abused, and it was being stretched as far as it could possibly be stretched.&quot;</p>\n<p>According to Skorup's data, for instance, the Wayne State University Police Department seized $9 in cash in a 2017 case that never resulted in a criminal conviction. The Roseville Police Department seized $5 and a cell phone in another case that ultimately did end in a conviction.</p>\n<p>While the reporting requirements passed in Michigan in 2015 track what police departments seize, it doesn't track what they spend it on. The head prosecutor of Macomb County, Michigan, is <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/macomb-county/2019/02/20/macomb-commissioners-back-audit-prosecutors-spending/2919343002/\">currently under scrutiny from county officials</a> after a public records lawsuit revealed more than $100,000 in questionable expenditures, including using forfeiture funds for office furniture, birthdays, and retirement parties.</p>\n<p>More than half of all states have passed some form of asset forfeiture reform in the past decade. Police have often opposed those reforms, saying asset forfeiture is a vital tool to disrupt drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>Skorup says that, while there are large seizures that net huge amounts of cash, the data shows that it's used most often against petty amounts of money and people who have few resources to defend themselves, rather than El Chapo.</p>\n<p>Of the total 2,078 cash seizures by Michigan law enforcement in 2017, the median value was $396, and the average value was $2,042. Overall, Michigan police seized $1.7 million in cash that was not accompanied by a criminal conviction.</p>\n<p>&quot;If you look at these files, we're not talking about a couple of flashy cases,&quot; he says. &quot;We're talking about hundreds and hundreds of people that are never charged, or even hundreds more where they're charged, found not guilty, and the law enforcement proceeds with the forfeiture anyways.&quot;</p>",

                "text": "In 2017, Michigan police seized property from nearly 1,000 people who were never convicted of a crime. Some of them were never even arrested.\nThose numbers\u2014the result of new reporting requirements passed by the state in 2015\u2014have spurred a bipartisan push among Michigan lawmakers to further restrict the practice of civil asset forfeiture, which allows police to seize cash and property suspected of being connected to criminal activity, even if the owner is never convicted, or sometimes never charged, with a crime.\nThe Michigan Senate passed a civil asset forfeiture reform bill last week that would require police to obtain a criminal conviction to seize assets valued under $50,000, or consent from the owner to relinquish the property. The bill is now being considered by the state house.\nJarrett Skorup, a researcher at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a free-market think tank, used a public records request to get the underlying data the state used to prepare its annual reports. Skorup's data showed that in 2017, the latest year for which information is available, Michigan police seized $13 million in cash and property\u2014everything ranging from guns to TVs to Playstation 4s to grow lights for marijuana. Bowling balls, jumper cables, power tools, and Beats headphones also made the list.\nThose spreadsheets also showed that police, particularly in Wayne County, Michigan, seized thousands of cars in 2017 under the auspices of marijuana enforcement. Of the more than 2,500 vehicles seized, 473 were not accompanied by a criminal conviction, and in 438 of those cases, no one was even charged with a crime, according to Skorup's data. In 10 cases, the cars were seized under suspicion of a drug violation, even though the records say police didn't find any drugs.\n\"The vehicles are worth very little, typically around $1,000 or $2,000,\" Skorup says. \"These are very likely low-income people, people that can't afford to sit around without a vehicle for three weeks or afford an attorney to go challenge it.\"\nWayne County prosecutors typically offer to settle such forfeiture cases and return the owner's car for a $900 payment. The alternative is paying out-of-pocket to hire an attorney and fight the forfeiture case, which in many cases would likely exceed the estimated worth of the car.\nThe Wayne County Sheriff's Office reported in 2016 that it surveilled 32 medical marijuana dispensaries, performed 634 investigatory stops of cars leaving dispensaries, and impounded 467 vehicles as part of Operation Push-Off, a local law enforcement initiative targeting drugs, prostitution, and drag racing funded by licensing fees collected from the state's medical marijuana program.\nIt all adds up to big money for local law enforcement. According to state reports, Wayne County law enforcement received $473,256 in Medical Marihuana Operation and Oversight Grants in fiscal year 2016 and $483,132 in 2017.\nAs Reason reported, Wayne County's asset forfeiture program is now the subject of a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by a woman whose car was seized after Wayne County Sheriff's deputies found $10 worth of marijuana in it. The suit claims the seizure and settlement fee were a violation of the Eighth Amendment's protections against excessive fines and fees. (The Supreme Court unanimously ruled earlier this week, in the case of Indiana man challenging the forfeiture of his Land Rover, that the Eighth Amendment applies to states.)\nMichigan law enforcement is pushing back against the reform efforts. Testifying at a House committee hearing on the proposed legislation this week, Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police executive director Robert Stevenson said it would essentially subject police to a higher standard than many other areas of government.\n\"The federal government can seize your money for tax evasion without a criminal conviction,\" Stevenson told lawmakers. \"Geoffrey Fieger has made a very good living seizing people's money without any type of conviction.

Justin Amash (R&ndash;Mich.) today suggested that while he's not necessarily opposed to &quot;additional funding&quot; for border security, he doesn't believe declaring a national emergency is the right way to obtain it.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump declared a national emergency earlier this month after Congress gave him just $1.375 billion of the $5.7 billion he'd demanded for construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump's plan is to reallocate, via national emergency powers, roughly $3.5 billion from the military construction budget in order to build the wall.</p>\n<p>While Republican leaders in Congress endorsed the move, Democrats did not. Last week, more than 200 members of Congress co-sponsored a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Phil_Mattingly/status/1098964734240526336\">resolution</a>, originally introduced by Rep. Joaquin Castro (D&ndash;Texas), to block the national emergency. The resolution <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/02/26/house-votes-to-terminate-trumps-national\">passed the House</a> today in a 245-182 vote. All of the bill's co-sponsors were Democrats, with the exception of Amash.</p>\n<p>Prior to the House's scheduled vote on the resolution Tuesday, Amash explained in detail why he opposes Trump's national emergency declaration. &quot;There are a lot of fair arguments being made for additional funding, for additional fencing, for enhanced fencing.

                "text": "Rep. Justin Amash (R\u2013Mich.) today suggested that while he's not necessarily opposed to \"additional funding\" for border security, he doesn't believe declaring a national emergency is the right way to obtain it.\nPresident Donald Trump declared a national emergency earlier this month after Congress gave him just $1.375 billion of the $5.7 billion he'd demanded for construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump's plan is to reallocate, via national emergency powers, roughly $3.5 billion from the military construction budget in order to build the wall.\nWhile Republican leaders in Congress endorsed the move, Democrats did not. Last week, more than 200 members of Congress co-sponsored a resolution, originally introduced by Rep. Joaquin Castro (D\u2013Texas), to block the national emergency. The resolution passed the House today in a 245-182 vote. All of the bill's co-sponsors were Democrats, with the exception of Amash.\nPrior to the House's scheduled vote on the resolution Tuesday, Amash explained in detail why he opposes Trump's national emergency declaration. \"There are a lot of fair arguments being made for additional funding, for additional fencing, for enhanced fencing. But that funding has to go through Congress,\" Amash told ABC News. \"The president doesn't get to just declare an emergency for something that Congress has deliberated many times over the past several years.\"\nAmash explained that Trump has previously signed legislation that did not include the billions he wants in border wall funding. If it wasn't a national emergency then, why is it now? \"I think we have to be really careful about proceeding here,\" Amash said to ABC. \"We have to make sure that each branch stays within its own lane and Congress retains its power over the purse.\"\nAmash is chairman of the House Liberty Caucus, which announced its opposition to Trump's national emergency declaration on similar grounds. \"Few dispute the president's ability to act quickly to address a real emergency, but simply saying something is an emergency does not make it so and cannot on its own trigger emergency powers,\" the caucus's statement reads:\nVOTE ALERT: HLC statement on #HJRes46, relating to a national emergency declared by the president on February 15, 2019 pic.twitter.com/mPoDwEfyrk\n\u2014 House Liberty Caucus (@libertycaucus) February 26, 2019\nRep.

Bernie Sanders (I&ndash;Vt.), including David Sirota, a columnist and political activist who once praised the economic policies of former Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez.</p>\n<p>In a 2013 column for <em>Salon</em>, Sirota <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2013/03/06/hugo_chavezs_economic_miracle/\">credited</a> Chavez's &quot;full-throated advocacy of socialism&quot; with achieving an economic miracle. &quot;As shown by some of the most significant indicators, Chavez racked up an economic record that a legacy-obsessed American president could only dream of achieving,&quot; he wrote.</p>\n<p>Sirota's piece rants against <a href=\"https://reason.com/archives/2018/12/30/what-does-neoliberalism-really\">neoliberalism</a> in a manner characteristic of activist and academic discourse on the far-left.</p>\n<p>&quot;As evidenced by the treatment of everyone from Martin Luther King to Michael Moore to Oliver Stone to anyone else who dares question neoliberalism and economic imperialism, that punishment is all about marginalization&mdash;the kind that avoids engaging on substance for fear of allowing the notion of socialism to even enter the conversation in the first place,&quot; Sirota wrote.</p>\n<p>Sanders himself is no stranger to effusive praise for socialism, and not just the allegedly friendlier version touted by the resurgent Democratic Socialists of America, but full-on authoritarian socialism as practiced by countries like the Soviet Union. In a <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/03/14/bernie-sanders-wanted-public-ownership-o\">1988 interview</a>, Sanders talked about how fantastic the Soviet Union's public transportation was&mdash;reserving special praise for its many &quot;works of art, and chandeliers, which were beautiful.&quot; Sanders also defended <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2018/09/11/bernie-sanders-defender-of-bread-lines-a\">bread lines</a>&mdash;a common feature of communist countries&mdash;as a &quot;good thing,&quot; because they meant that people were getting food.</p>\n<p>More recently, Sanders <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/florida-democrats-slam-bernie-sanders-venezuela-nicolas-maduro-dictator-1340687\">refused</a> to label Venezuela's embattled leader, Nicholas Maduro, a dictator. However, he did criticize the regime's human rights abuses, saying in a statement, &quot;the Maduro government in Venezuela has been waging a violent crackdown on Venezuelan civil society.&quot; He also urged the U.S. government not to intervene in the matter, which is admirable.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Sanders' comparatively restrained foreign policy is the best thing about his candidacy. His affection for nationalizing industries, on the other hand, is less than desirable. It should go without saying, but <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-water/desperate-venezuelans-swarm-sewage-drains-in-search-of-water-idUSKBN1QS2SN\">there has been no economic miracle in Venezuela.</a></p>\n<p>Sirota joins the Sanders campaign as a senior advisor and speechwriter. Sanders has also hired Briahna Joy Gray, a former writer and editor at <em>The Intercept.</em></p>\n<figure><video src=\"https://cdn5.anyclip.com/AW7_cY-xhs_tG0RTkS2i/1576243966687_1280x720_clip.mp4?wid=0011r000025cGJn_406\"></video></figure>",

                "text": "Several new staffers have joined the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I\u2013Vt.), including David Sirota, a columnist and political activist who once praised the economic policies of former Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez.\nIn a 2013 column for Salon, Sirota credited Chavez's \"full-throated advocacy of socialism\" with achieving an economic miracle. \"As shown by some of the most significant indicators, Chavez racked up an economic record that a legacy-obsessed American president could only dream of achieving,\" he wrote.\nSirota's piece rants against neoliberalism in a manner characteristic of activist and academic discourse on the far-left.\n\"As evidenced by the treatment of everyone from Martin Luther King to Michael Moore to Oliver Stone to anyone else who dares question neoliberalism and economic imperialism, that punishment is all about marginalization\u2014the kind that avoids engaging on substance for fear of allowing the notion of socialism to even enter the conversation in the first place,\" Sirota wrote.\nSanders himself is no stranger to effusive praise for socialism, and not just the allegedly friendlier version touted by the resurgent Democratic Socialists of America, but full-on authoritarian socialism as practiced by countries like the Soviet Union. In a 1988 interview, Sanders talked about how fantastic the Soviet Union's public transportation was\u2014reserving special praise for its many \"works of art, and chandeliers, which were beautiful.\" Sanders also defended bread lines\u2014a common feature of communist countries\u2014as a \"good thing,\" because they meant that people were getting food.\nMore recently, Sanders refused to label Venezuela's embattled leader, Nicholas Maduro, a dictator. However, he did criticize the regime's human rights abuses, saying in a statement, \"the Maduro government in Venezuela has been waging a violent crackdown on Venezuelan civil society.\" He also urged the U.S. government not to intervene in the matter, which is admirable.\nIndeed, Sanders' comparatively restrained foreign policy is the best thing about his candidacy. His affection for nationalizing industries, on the other hand, is less than desirable. It should go without saying, but there has been no economic miracle in Venezuela.\nSirota joins the Sanders campaign as a senior advisor and speechwriter. Sanders has also hired Briahna Joy Gray, a former writer and editor at The Intercept.",

And I inhaled. I did inhale. It was a long time ago.&quot;</p>\n<p>The other senator Booker had in mind presumably was Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a presidential contender who appeared on the same show this month and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/04/bernie-sanders-marijuana-reparations-1201388\">described</a> his experience with cannabis this way: &quot;Didn't do a whole lot for me. My recollection is I nearly coughed my brains out, so it's not my cup of tea.&quot;</p>\n<p>I'm not sure either of those answers qualifies as &quot;bragging,&quot; but Booker's point was that such lighthearted comments tend to obscure the fact that hundreds of thousands of people are still arrested every year on marijuana charges, the vast majority of them for simple possession, and have to <a href=\"https://reason.com/archives/2019/03/01/the-lingering-stench-of-mariju\">bear the burden</a> of those criminal records. He made similar remarks during an appearance in Davenport, Iowa, on Sunday. &quot;We have presidential candidates and congresspeople and senators that now talk about their marijuana use almost as if it's funny,&quot; he <a href=\"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/cory-booker-appears-to-call-out-kamala-harriss-marijuana-jokes/\">said</a>. &quot;But meanwhile, in 2017, we had more arrests for marijuana possession in this country than all the violent crime arrests combined.&quot;</p>\n<p>Booker, a former mayor of Newark, noted that black people are much more likely to be busted for pot than white people, even though they are only slightly more likely to be cannabis consumers. &quot;In Newark, I'm sorry, the margins for error for my kids to experiment with drugs, like people often do, that margin is not there,&quot; he said. &quot;And then one kid gets one charge for possession of marijuana for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, and what happens to their lives?&quot; Booker, who recently <a href=\"https://reason.com/archives/2019/03/06/relief-for-victims-of-pot-prohibition\">reintroduced</a> a bill that would remove marijuana from the federal government's list of prohibited drugs and expunge federal records of &quot;marijuana use or possession offense[s],&quot; said, &quot;Do not talk to me about legalizing marijuana unless in the same breath you talk to me about expunging the records of the millions of people that are suffering with not being able to find a job.&quot;</p>\n<p>Booker's emphasis on expungement is commendable, and his knock against Harris is fair enough, given that she not only treated marijuana as a subject of levity during her radio interview but did not embrace legalization until <a href=\"https://medium.com/@KamalaHarris/repeating-the-same-mistakes-of-the-past-b2e2a7d567a7\">last year</a> and prior to that literally <a href=\"https://www.kcra.com/article/commitment-2014-the-race-for-californias-ag/5955217\">laughed</a> at the idea. But Sanders <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2015/11/05/bernie-sanders-unveils-legislation-to-re\">introduced</a> a legalization bill back in 2015, two years before Booker's <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1689\">Marijuana Justice Act</a>. He supports legalization even though marijuana is not his &quot;cup of tea,&quot; and he has expressed concerns similar to Booker's.</p>\n<p>&quot;I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for non-violent offenses,&quot; Sanders <a href=\"https://reason.com/archives/2015/10/19/bernie-and-hillarys-marijuana-misconcept\">said</a> during a 2015 presidential debate. &quot;We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think through this war on drugs, which has done an enormous amount of damage. We need to rethink our criminal justice system.&quot;</p>\n<figure><video src=\"https://cdn5.anyclip.com/AW7_cY-xhs_tG0RTkS2i/1576243966687_1280x720_clip.mp4?wid=0011r000025cGJn_406\"></video></figure>\n<p>The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.</p>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.365.1_en.html#goog_762815394\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Advertisement</p>",

                "text": "Kamala Harris' joke about marijuana and Jamaica did not go over well with her Jamaican father, who criticized her for perpetuating a \"fraudulent stereotype.\" Cory Booker, one of her rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, also was not amused. \"We have presidential candidates\u2014senators\u2014bragging about their pot use while there are kids who can't get a job because they have a nonviolent offense,\" the New Jersey senator said on MSNBC last night.\nWhen asked whether she supports marijuana legalization during an interview on the syndicated radio show The Breakfast Club last month, Harris, a California senator, replied, \"Half my family is from Jamaica; are you kidding me?\" Asked whether she had ever smoked marijuana, she said, \"I have. And I inhaled. I did inhale. It was a long time ago.\"\nThe other senator Booker had in mind presumably was Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a presidential contender who appeared on the same show this month and described his experience with cannabis this way: \"Didn't do a whole lot for me. My recollection is I nearly coughed my brains out, so it's not my cup of tea.\"\nI'm not sure either of those answers qualifies as \"bragging,\" but Booker's point was that such lighthearted comments tend to obscure the fact that hundreds of thousands of people are still arrested every year on marijuana charges, the vast majority of them for simple possession, and have to bear the burden of those criminal records. He made similar remarks during an appearance in Davenport, Iowa, on Sunday. \"We have presidential candidates and congresspeople and senators that now talk about their marijuana use almost as if it's funny,\" he said. \"But meanwhile, in 2017, we had more arrests for marijuana possession in this country than all the violent crime arrests combined.\"\nBooker, a former mayor of Newark, noted that black people are much more likely to be busted for pot than white people, even though they are only slightly more likely to be cannabis consumers. \"In Newark, I'm sorry, the margins for error for my kids to experiment with drugs, like people often do, that margin is not there,\" he said. \"And then one kid gets one charge for possession of marijuana for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, and what happens to their lives?\" Booker, who recently reintroduced a bill that would remove marijuana from the federal government's list of prohibited drugs and expunge federal records of \"marijuana use or possession offense[s],\" said, \"Do not talk to me about legalizing marijuana unless in the same breath you talk to me about expunging the records of the millions of people that are suffering with not being able to find a job.\"\nBooker's emphasis on expungement is commendable, and his knock against Harris is fair enough, given that she not only treated marijuana as a subject of levity during her radio interview but did not embrace legalization until last year and prior to that literally laughed at the idea. But Sanders introduced a legalization bill back in 2015, two years before Booker's Marijuana Justice Act. He supports legalization even though marijuana is not his \"cup of tea,\" and he has expressed concerns similar to Booker's.\n\"I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for non-violent offenses,\" Sanders said during a 2015 presidential debate. \"We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think through this war on drugs, which has done an enormous amount of damage. We need to rethink our criminal justice system.\"\nThe media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.\nAdvertisement",

In a new <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/402297422/Nunes-Complaint-3-18-19\">lawsuit</a>, Rep. Devin Nunes (R&ndash;Calif.) is accusing Twitter of engaging in systematic &quot;shadowbanning&quot; of conservatives, allowing defamation against him, and basically orchestrating a conspiracy against him by&hellip;well, existing.</p>\n<p>Shadowbanning is the nefarious term aggrieved users have cooked up for algorithmic processes that lead to some posts showing up in more timelines than others, or some accounts getting put in a time out (based on things like multiple reports to Twitter support) in which users can still tweet and people can still read their tweets but their content may not be broadcast into feeds for a period of time. Some conservatives convinced their content isn't getting the attention it deserves have latched on to the idea that they're part of targeted Twitter action to suppress conservatives. Perversely claiming the mantle of free speech, they want the government to force a private company to somehow redistribute attention to them (or pay them for not doing so).</p>\n<p>Nunes is seeking $250,350,000 on behalf of himself and a few other Twitter users, claiming (without evidence) that they have been systematically censored. He is claiming conspiracy, that Twitter was negligent with regard to &quot;insulting words&quot; aimed at him, and that it both permitted and &quot;created&quot; defamatory posts about him.</p>\n<p>In the suit, &quot;Nunes claimed Twitter wanted to derail his work on the House Intelligence Committee, which he chaired until 2019,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nunes-files-bombshell-defamation-suit-against-twitter-seeks-250m-for-anti-conservative-shadow-bans-smears\">reports</a> Fox News. Nunes is ranking Republican member on the committee.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit was filed in Maryland state court&mdash;which means that on the defamation claim, Nunes runs up against Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (the one that says web platforms aren't to be treated as the speaker of user-posted content for state and civil legal liability purposes). Under Section 230, Twitter does not need to determine itself what is or isn't defamatory content, it only needs comply if legal authorities say it must take something down.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Nunes knows all this; some congressional <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2018/11/28/stop-blaming-section-230\">Republicans have been itching to dismantle Section 230</a> further under the guise of promoting ideological fairness on social media. Based on a complete misreading of the law, folks like Nunes and <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/03/01/josh-hawley-section-230-big-tech-cpac\">Sen. Josh Hawley</a> (R&ndash;Mo.) have begun arguing that in making any content decisions at all, Twitter and its ilk should be excluded from Section 230 protection. But this is directly opposite of how the law works and what all sorts of judges have written on it.</p>\n<p>Nunes also offers an absurd reading of what it meant to &quot;create&quot; content. Under Section 230, platforms and web service providers lose protection if they <em>create</em> or substantially edit the criminal content. Nunes suggests that Twitter somehow &quot;created&quot; the content (that was authored and posted via myriad individual users) because it made &quot;a publicly available commodity&quot; that people could use to spread words, and &quot;unscrupulous political operatives&quot; had used some of those words against him.</p>\n<p>Even if the lawsuit isn't searching for a Section 230 challenge, it's still a fishing expedition of sorts. Nunes' claims may ultimately be declared nonsense, but Twitter defending the lawsuit would mean it has to turn over all sorts of internal company documents and process information as part of discovery.</p>\n<p>This is the same process officials pulled with Backpage and other internet companies. With access to enough internal communication, maybe they'll find that at some point Twitter staff or leadership made some misstep with regards to a specific content moderation decision. That can be all it takes to order congressional hearings and command misleading headlines.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps Nunes is more simpleminded and petty than all that. As part of the suit he's seeking the identities of people behind specific accounts that were critical of him&mdash;including accounts using the name @DevinCow and claiming to be Devin Nunes' Cow and also @DevinNunesMom&mdash;and which he says are guilty of legitimate harassment and defamation. Maybe this is all a ploy to find out who his biggest Twitter enemies are.</p>\n<p>Any or all of the above motivations don't bode well coming from an elected official who helps oversee national intelligence policy.</p>\n<h3>FREE MINDS</h3>\n<p><strong>UC&ndash;Davis stands by professor.</strong> Folks on the right complain a lot&mdash;and rightfully so&mdash;when liberal college students demand censorship of each other or their teachers in the name of being kept safe from &quot;dangerous&quot; (or simply disagreeable to them) ideas. But give chattering-class conservatives a chance to pull the same speech-stifling silliness on someone they find taboo, and time and again they will take it. Our latest example of this comes from the University of California-Davis, where English professor Joshua Clover tweeted a few years ago about dead cops.</p>\n<p>His words &quot;are horrifying statements, but they are also protected by the First Amendment,&quot; writes Robby Soave. &quot;Clover's general endorsement of violence against the police is not a true threat, or incitement to lawless action.&quot; Read more on the situation <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/03/18/uc-davis-joshua-clover-cops-speech\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>FREE MARKETS</h3>\n<p><strong>SCOTUS declines Hawaii lesbian case.</strong> The Supreme Court won't hear a case in which a Honolulu bed and breakfast was found in violation of Hawaii anti-discrimination law by refusing to allow a lesbian couple to stay there. Comparisons to <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop</em> aren't quite right, here, <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/03/18/supreme-court-declines-to-consider-wheth\">pointed out</a> <em>Reason</em>'s Scott Shackford yesterday.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, was clear that he wasn't refusing to sell cakes to gay people or to gay couples.

                "text": "A prominent member of the House Intelligence Committee is suing Twitter over conspiracy theories in an effort to overhaul fundamental federal tech policy and force the doxxing of his critics, including a fake cow. In a new lawsuit, Rep. Devin Nunes (R\u2013Calif.) is accusing Twitter of engaging in systematic \"shadowbanning\" of conservatives, allowing defamation against him, and basically orchestrating a conspiracy against him by\u2026well, existing.\nShadowbanning is the nefarious term aggrieved users have cooked up for algorithmic processes that lead to some posts showing up in more timelines than others, or some accounts getting put in a time out (based on things like multiple reports to Twitter support) in which users can still tweet and people can still read their tweets but their content may not be broadcast into feeds for a period of time. Some conservatives convinced their content isn't getting the attention it deserves have latched on to the idea that they're part of targeted Twitter action to suppress conservatives. Perversely claiming the mantle of free speech, they want the government to force a private company to somehow redistribute attention to them (or pay them for not doing so).\nNunes is seeking $250,350,000 on behalf of himself and a few other Twitter users, claiming (without evidence) that they have been systematically censored. He is claiming conspiracy, that Twitter was negligent with regard to \"insulting words\" aimed at him, and that it both permitted and \"created\" defamatory posts about him.\nIn the suit, \"Nunes claimed Twitter wanted to derail his work on the House Intelligence Committee, which he chaired until 2019,\" reports Fox News. Nunes is ranking Republican member on the committee.\nThe lawsuit was filed in Maryland state court\u2014which means that on the defamation claim, Nunes runs up against Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (the one that says web platforms aren't to be treated as the speaker of user-posted content for state and civil legal liability purposes). Under Section 230, Twitter does not need to determine itself what is or isn't defamatory content, it only needs comply if legal authorities say it must take something down.\nPerhaps Nunes knows all this; some congressional Republicans have been itching to dismantle Section 230 further under the guise of promoting ideological fairness on social media. Based on a complete misreading of the law, folks like Nunes and Sen. Josh Hawley (R\u2013Mo.) have begun arguing that in making any content decisions at all, Twitter and its ilk should be excluded from Section 230 protection. But this is directly opposite of how the law works and what all sorts of judges have written on it.\nNunes also offers an absurd reading of what it meant to \"create\" content. Under Section 230, platforms and web service providers lose protection if they create or substantially edit the criminal content. Nunes suggests that Twitter somehow \"created\" the content (that was authored and posted via myriad individual users) because it made \"a publicly available commodity\" that people could use to spread words, and \"unscrupulous political operatives\" had used some of those words against him.\nEven if the lawsuit isn't searching for a Section 230 challenge, it's still a fishing expedition of sorts. Nunes' claims may ultimately be declared nonsense, but Twitter defending the lawsuit would mean it has to turn over all sorts of internal company documents and process information as part of discovery.\nThis is the same process officials pulled with Backpage and other internet companies. With access to enough internal communication, maybe they'll find that at some point Twitter staff or leadership made some misstep with regards to a specific content moderation decision. That can be all it takes to order congressional hearings and command misleading headlines.\nOr perhaps Nunes is more simpleminded and petty than all that. As part of the suit he's seeking the identities of people behind specific accounts that were critical of him\u2014including accounts using the name @DevinCow and claiming to be Devin Nunes' Cow and also @DevinNunesMom\u2014and which he says are guilty of legitimate harassment and defamation. Maybe this is all a ploy to find out who his biggest Twitter enemies are.\nAny or all of the above motivations don't bode well coming from an elected official who helps oversee national intelligence policy.\nFREE MINDS\nUC\u2013Davis stands by professor. Folks on the right complain a lot\u2014and rightfully so\u2014when liberal college students demand censorship of each other or their teachers in the name of being kept safe from \"dangerous\" (or simply disagreeable to them) ideas. But give chattering-class conservatives a chance to pull the same speech-stifling silliness on someone they find taboo, and time and again they will take it. Our latest example of this comes from the University of California-Davis, where English professor Joshua Clover tweeted a few years ago about dead cops.\nHis words \"are horrifying statements, but they are also protected by the First Amendment,\" writes Robby Soave. \"Clover's general endorsement of violence against the police is not a true threat, or incitement to lawless action.\" Read more on the situation here.\nFREE MARKETS\nSCOTUS declines Hawaii lesbian case. The Supreme Court won't hear a case in which a Honolulu bed and breakfast was found in violation of Hawaii anti-discrimination law by refusing to allow a lesbian couple to stay there. Comparisons to Masterpiece Cakeshop aren't quite right, here, pointed out Reason's Scott Shackford yesterday.\nJack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, was clear that he wasn't refusing to sell cakes to gay people or to gay couples. He argued that his religious opposition to gay marriage recognition meant that he shouldn't have to make a cake that would be seen as celebrating same-sex marriage.\n\"Reasonable people can debate whether baking a cake counts as a form of expression,\" Shackford continues. But \"renting a room or a home is not seen by most as requiring a personal or moral approval of the renting party's romantic relationships.\" (Libertarians may disagree, but we're talking about prevailing popular opinion and legal interpretations here.)\nOne more note: many people think the bakery case\u2014which SCOTUS did take on, ruling in favor of Phillips\u2014hinged on Phillips' right to free expression under the First Amendment. At oral arguments, \"they publicly debated what counted as speech or expression in the producing of a consumer good and whether forcing Phillips to bake a cake was compelling him to engage in speech, but they didn't ultimately decide the case on that issue,\" notes Shackford.

And immigration officials have this authority even if they don't get around to detaining these people for months or even years after the offense was committed.</p>\n<p>This is a complex and highly technical case, and while there's some coverage suggesting that this is a big victory over <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-19/supreme-court-backs-trump-administration-in-deportation-case\">sanctuary cities</a>, I'd be reluctant to classify it that way. The ruling does, however, mean that those sweeps where feds come swooping into communities looking for deportable immigrants are potentially even more of a worry for the targets. And sanctuary cities (where local authorities deliberately decline to check the immigration status of people they interact with or share that information with the federal government) are top targets for these sweeps.</p>\n<p>So who is this case about? People who are 1.) living in the country completely legally and are not fugitives from justice, who've 2.) been previously arrested, convicted, and even served time for crimes that are deportable under federal law, but 3.) were not deported immediately (or even years) after serving their sentence.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/nielsen-v-preap-respondents-brief\">One of the defendants</a> at the heart of this case&mdash;Eduardo Vega Padilla, a legal permanent resident since he moved to the U.S. as a toddler in 1966&mdash;was convicted of possession of a controlled substance in 1997 and 1999. He was arrested while on probation for that offense when officers found an unloaded pistol in a shed behind his house, and he served six months in jail in 2002. Eleven years later, officials for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) came for him and held him in detention for possible deportation.</p>\n<p>Can they do that? And is Padilla entitled to a hearing and possible release from detention so that he can fight his case? Today, the Supreme Court ruled that immigration officials do not have to detain someone immediately after they're released from jail in order to eventually deport them for the offense that landed them in jail; it also ruled that noncitizens who have committed certain crimes (detailed in legislation passed by Congress in the 1990s) are not entitled to a bond hearing that would allow them to fight their case from outside of a jail.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/16-1363_a86c.pdf\">ruling</a> does not appear to address due process issues or concerns about indefinite detention that might be raised by the Fifth or Eighth Amendments of the Constitution. In the majority decision, written by Justice Samuel Alito and joined by Brett Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts (Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch teamed up to concur in a separate piece), the justices noted that this case was decided over the statutory interpretations of the law and not the constitutionality of it, because the respondents did not challenge whether it was constitutional to detain people like Padilla. They concluded:</p>\n<blockquote><p> We emphasize that respondents' arguments here have all been statutory.

                "text": "Federal immigration officials have the authority to track down immigrants and noncitizens who have committed certain crimes, months and even possibly years after they've been released, and hold them without bond hearings for potential deportation, the Supreme Court ruled today.\nThe ruling in Nielsen v Preap was narrowly decided, 5-4, along ideological lines, with the more conservative justices agreeing with President Donald Trump's administration that immigration officials do not need to provide bond hearings and offer the possibility of release to people who have committed certain crimes and are facing possible deportation. And immigration officials have this authority even if they don't get around to detaining these people for months or even years after the offense was committed.\nThis is a complex and highly technical case, and while there's some coverage suggesting that this is a big victory over sanctuary cities, I'd be reluctant to classify it that way. The ruling does, however, mean that those sweeps where feds come swooping into communities looking for deportable immigrants are potentially even more of a worry for the targets. And sanctuary cities (where local authorities deliberately decline to check the immigration status of people they interact with or share that information with the federal government) are top targets for these sweeps.\nSo who is this case about? People who are 1.) living in the country completely legally and are not fugitives from justice, who've 2.) been previously arrested, convicted, and even served time for crimes that are deportable under federal law, but 3.) were not deported immediately (or even years) after serving their sentence.\nOne of the defendants at the heart of this case\u2014Eduardo Vega Padilla, a legal permanent resident since he moved to the U.S. as a toddler in 1966\u2014was convicted of possession of a controlled substance in 1997 and 1999. He was arrested while on probation for that offense when officers found an unloaded pistol in a shed behind his house, and he served six months in jail in 2002. Eleven years later, officials for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) came for him and held him in detention for possible deportation.\nCan they do that? And is Padilla entitled to a hearing and possible release from detention so that he can fight his case? Today, the Supreme Court ruled that immigration officials do not have to detain someone immediately after they're released from jail in order to eventually deport them for the offense that landed them in jail; it also ruled that noncitizens who have committed certain crimes (detailed in legislation passed by Congress in the 1990s) are not entitled to a bond hearing that would allow them to fight their case from outside of a jail.\nThe ruling does not appear to address due process issues or concerns about indefinite detention that might be raised by the Fifth or Eighth Amendments of the Constitution. In the majority decision, written by Justice Samuel Alito and joined by Brett Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts (Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch teamed up to concur in a separate piece), the justices noted that this case was decided over the statutory interpretations of the law and not the constitutionality of it, because the respondents did not challenge whether it was constitutional to detain people like Padilla. They concluded:\nWe emphasize that respondents' arguments here have all been statutory. Even their constitutional concerns are offered as just another pillar in an argument for their preferred reading of the language of \u00a71226(c)\u2014an idle pillar here because the statute is clear. While respondents might have raised a head-on constitutional challenge to \u00a71226(c), they did not. Our decision today on the meaning of that statutory provision does not foreclose as-applied challenges\u2014that is, constitutional challenges to applications of the statute as we have now read it.\nThat's something of a hint: if similar plaintiffs want such a case heard again, they need to make a constitutional argument.\nIn the dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer (joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan) warned about the significant consequences of such an extreme application of these statutes and argued that these statutes cannot be considered without exploring the constitutional implications:\nThese aliens may then be detained for months, sometimes years, without the possibility of release; they may have been convicted of only minor crimes\u2014for example, minor drug offenses, or crimes of \"moral turpitude\" such as illegally downloading music or possessing stolen bus transfers; and they sometimes may be innocent spouses or children of a suspect person. Moreover, for a high percentage of them, it will turn out after months of custody that they will not be removed from the country because they are eligible by statute to receive a form of relief from removal such as cancellation of removal.\nWe should definitely be concerned of the constitutional implications when it appears Congress has granted the executive branch the authority (and even a mandate) to deny people bail without judicial review. Breyer concluded in his dissent, \"I fear that the Court's contrary interpretation will work serious harm to the principles for which American law has long stood.\"\nRead the court ruling here.",

Snooki from Jersey Shore? Puck from The Real World, Season 1? Donald Trump? All the same.\nYou don\u2019t want Honey Boo Boo running the country, do you?\nBut he was much worse than just a joke: He was a fanged, drooling Son of Satan, out to murder all people and destroy all things (here). He was in cahoots with Putin to rule the world, Dr. Evil-style (here). He was a yellow-haired madman who\u2019s puffy coif hid his 666.\nDespite the idiocy of the assertion, it\u2019s shown no sign of stopping. It\u2019s absurd; it\u2019s outrageous; and it\u2019s the new school of politics.\nAnd it\u2019s perfectly illustrated by a Saturday Night Live sketch from 1986, lampooning then-President Ronald Reagan.\nReagan was an ol\u2019 softie \u2014 he had a grandfatherly demeanor and wrote constant love letters to his wife (For more, get the phenomenal book I Love You, Ronnie; if you want to truly discover the 40th president of the United States, you\u2019ll find him there).\nSNL spoofed Reagan in a lighthearted way; it didn\u2019t feel mean. The program\u2019s current political skewering of Trump \u2014 by contrast \u2014 is so ugly, it\u2019s hard to watch. It\u2019s not so much comedy as rage against the 2016 election.\nBut I guess they figure that rage is more than justified; after all, we elected Lucifer. And the SNL skit nails what they believe Beelzebub\u2019s doing.\nEnjoy.\n-Alex\nRelevant RedState links in this article: here and here.\nSee 3 more pieces from me:\nFind all my RedState work here.\nThank you for reading!

The end to his prosecution only served to raise a whole buncha questions.\nOne question that\u2019s no longer hovering is, \u201cWill Jussie star in the play?\u201d\nThe answer:\nFrom the Daily Mail:\n\u201cEverything was set to go and the producers were planning to announce that Jussie and Zachary Quinto were starring in the play last month,\u201d said one Broadway insider.\n\u201cEveryone was so supportive after the attack and then suddenly, everything shifted.\u201d\nIt was all on account of a shock:\nAnother source close to the production reiterated this, and said that the events of the last few months have left them in shock.\nAnd it was a great missed opportunity:\n\u201cHere is a kid who is on a hit television show, has made a name for himself, and gets the chance of a lifetime,\u201d said that source.\n\u201cHe would have come off the sixth season of Empire and kicked off the next leg of his career with a role on Broadway. And not just that, the lead role in one of the best plays of the century in his Broadway debut.\u201d\nThat source then added: \u201cWhy on earth would someone throw that all away.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a good question.\nAnd the impact of his decisions continues.\nJussie had appeared to be all in. But in the end, the Broadway show followed the edict of its title: They Took Him Out.\n-Alex\nRelevant RedState links in this article: here, here, here, and here.\nSee 3 more pieces from me:\nDown-To-Earth Keanu Reeves Gets Stranded After Plane Grounding, Joins Passengers On Road Trip To LA\nAnd A Turn For The Worse: New Zealand Mosque Leader Blames 50-Victim Massacre On The Jews\nFind all my RedState work here.\nThank you for reading!

Have some self-respect and delete that tweet.</p>\n<p>Then something happened this year. Beto suddenly became a threat to the inter-sectional demands of the Democratic primary by being white and rich. In response, they are desperately trying to stuff him back into the perfectly shaped box he came in. It&rsquo;s not going to happen though. You can&rsquo;t praise him as the Irish Obama in 2018 and then pretend to suddenly discover he&rsquo;s an empty suit in 2019. You built him, you get to live with him.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;ve now gotten so desperate to bury this guy early that they are mining his friends for baby poop stories. As the sniping continues in the 2020 Democratic primary, there&rsquo;s something mildly entertaining about watching it all burn down.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t wait until Kamala Harris asks Beto if it&rsquo;s spousal abuse to prank your wife with the contents of your son&rsquo;s dirty diapers. That crap is gonna be lit.</p>\n<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>\n<p><strong><em>Enjoying the read?

Then it was his incessant need to apologize for the most ridiculous things to pander to the Democratic base. Now, he\u2019s apparently got a thing for trying to trick his wife into eating baby poo.\nThis is the 2020 Democratic race. Embrace it.\nomg. \"One time, according to a friend, Beto collected an especially verdant turd from one of their kids\u2019 diapers and put it in a bowl, telling Amy it was avocado.\" https://t.co/kJC72B7IvX\n\u2014 Seung Min Kim (@seungminkim) March 19, 2019\nI\u2019m trying to think of what my wife would do to me if I attempted such a prank. It\u2019d likely involve sharp objects and an attorney.\nBut seriously, the sillier part of all this is just how hard Democrats are coming at Beto with their opposition research. This is the same guy who was a savior against Ted Cruz. He was cool, fresh, and he skateboarded. He dropped F bombs in concession speeches and rolled his sleeves up in all situations.\nIn short, Democrats looked at Beto like this supporter\u2019s wife looks at Beto.\nI hope someday that my wife looks at me the way this woman is looking at Beto.\nBTW, this is my wife.#Beto2020 #BetoMania pic.twitter.com/Qg2TEo1Fo6\n\u2014 John King (@johnkingaustin) March 15, 2019\nCome on bro. Have some self-respect and delete that tweet.\nThen something happened this year. Beto suddenly became a threat to the inter-sectional demands of the Democratic primary by being white and rich. In response, they are desperately trying to stuff him back into the perfectly shaped box he came in. It\u2019s not going to happen though. You can\u2019t praise him as the Irish Obama in 2018 and then pretend to suddenly discover he\u2019s an empty suit in 2019. You built him, you get to live with him.\nThey\u2019ve now gotten so desperate to bury this guy early that they are mining his friends for baby poop stories. As the sniping continues in the 2020 Democratic primary, there\u2019s something mildly entertaining about watching it all burn down.\nI can\u2019t wait until Kamala Harris asks Beto if it\u2019s spousal abuse to prank your wife with the contents of your son\u2019s dirty diapers. That crap is gonna be lit.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nEnjoying the read? Please visit my archive and check out some of my latest articles.\nI\u2019ve got a new twitter! Please help by following @bonchieredstate.",

They&rsquo;ve tried to maintain relevance by continually sniping at Fox News, even promoting boycotts against them, but it hasn&rsquo;t worked.</p>\n<p>The numbers <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/04/16/cnn-ratings-plummet-all-year-low/?utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=atdailycaller&utm_source=Twitter&__twitter_impression=true\">are out for last week</a> and they aren&rsquo;t pretty, at least not for CNN.</p>\n<blockquote><p>CNN had its lowest primetime weekly ratings overall and in the key age demographic last week, according to Nielsen Media Research.</p><p>From April 8-12, the network only averaged an audience of 690,000 people and 180,000 in the key 25-54 age demographic. Their coverage last week included three presidential town halls with New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli&aacute;n Castro.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In what should have been one of their bigger weeks, given all the special events they broadcast, their primetime numbers essentially bottomed out. Averaging only 690,000 viewers overall is absolutely awful. There are mid-level blogs that are getting more eyes than CNN does on your average weeknight.</p>\n<p>Just who beat out CNN? The list is long and hilarious.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The top networks for primetime viewership last week were led by Fox News, followed by MSNBC, the Home and Garden TV, USA Network and TBS Network to round out the top five.</p><p>CNN finished 15th, behind networks like Discovery Channel, Food Network, TLC and A&amp;E Network.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Keep in mind that many of the channels listed above have had their biggest shows already end as we head into the summer months, i.e. they are showing reruns. Yet, they are still beating out CNN during a period full of big news stories, including something as attention getting as the release of the Mueller report on Thursday.</p>\n<p>More people would rather watch reruns of 90 Day Fiance than sit through Chris Cuomo or Anderson Cooper bloviating for an hour. The real question is how do they stay solvent if this keeps up? Can they keep paying hosts millions a year to draw less then 750,000 viewers a night? I&rsquo;d guess their near monopoly on international cable news is helping their bottom line and will keep them afloat for a while yet.</p>\n<p>CNN is that guy who takes himself way too seriously and doesn&rsquo;t realize that everyone is just laughing at him. They call all their opinion hosts &ldquo;anchors&rdquo; and assert they are objective in a laughable bit of gaslighting. In a way, that is probably hurting them worse than if they were just honest. MSNBC beats them handily by at least not pretending they are something they aren&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Enjoying the read?

                "text": "Ever since it became clear Trump wasn\u2019t going to be indicted by Robert Mueller, nor was evidence coming forth that he colluded with the Russians, CNN has been heading downhill fast. They\u2019ve tried to maintain relevance by continually sniping at Fox News, even promoting boycotts against them, but it hasn\u2019t worked.\nThe numbers are out for last week and they aren\u2019t pretty, at least not for CNN.\nCNN had its lowest primetime weekly ratings overall and in the key age demographic last week, according to Nielsen Media Research.\nFrom April 8-12, the network only averaged an audience of 690,000 people and 180,000 in the key 25-54 age demographic. Their coverage last week included three presidential town halls with New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\nIn what should have been one of their bigger weeks, given all the special events they broadcast, their primetime numbers essentially bottomed out. Averaging only 690,000 viewers overall is absolutely awful. There are mid-level blogs that are getting more eyes than CNN does on your average weeknight.\nJust who beat out CNN? The list is long and hilarious.\nThe top networks for primetime viewership last week were led by Fox News, followed by MSNBC, the Home and Garden TV, USA Network and TBS Network to round out the top five.\nCNN finished 15th, behind networks like Discovery Channel, Food Network, TLC and A&E Network.\nKeep in mind that many of the channels listed above have had their biggest shows already end as we head into the summer months, i.e. they are showing reruns. Yet, they are still beating out CNN during a period full of big news stories, including something as attention getting as the release of the Mueller report on Thursday.\nMore people would rather watch reruns of 90 Day Fiance than sit through Chris Cuomo or Anderson Cooper bloviating for an hour. The real question is how do they stay solvent if this keeps up? Can they keep paying hosts millions a year to draw less then 750,000 viewers a night? I\u2019d guess their near monopoly on international cable news is helping their bottom line and will keep them afloat for a while yet.\nCNN is that guy who takes himself way too seriously and doesn\u2019t realize that everyone is just laughing at him. They call all their opinion hosts \u201canchors\u201d and assert they are objective in a laughable bit of gaslighting. In a way, that is probably hurting them worse than if they were just honest. MSNBC beats them handily by at least not pretending they are something they aren\u2019t.\nEnjoying the read?

He lost both of his legs while serving in said unit in Afghanistan. She was a &ldquo;fact-checker&rdquo; at The New Yorker at the time. After that episode, she eventually moved on to NYU, where she now teaches other young &ldquo;journalists&rdquo; how to also make stuff up and slander military veterans.</p>\n<p>Well, she&rsquo;s apparently got a thing for aiming vile language toward injured soldiers because she&rsquo;s doing it again.</p>\n<p>This time Rep. Dan Crenshaw is her target and it started with this tweet.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p>This week was a new low in partisanship &amp; dishonesty.</p><p>I watched in disbelief as some covered for Omar by coming after me with lies &amp; absurd claims that I don&rsquo;t support 9/11 victims.</p><p>What a disgusting, dishonest tactic.</p><p>Why turn this into a political football?</p><p>Full NBC int: <a href=\"https://t.co/sVXvzHDPnP\">pic.twitter.com/sVXvzHDPnP</a></p><p>&mdash; Rep.

If only he had tended bar instead. Then he&rsquo;d be a real hero, but I digress.</p>\n<p>Lavin apparently took issue with Crenshaw not treating AOC with kid gloves.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p>the real victim, captain shithead, speaks <a href=\"https://t.co/1Yeu10YuEY\">https://t.co/1Yeu10YuEY</a></p><p>&mdash; Talia Lavin (@chick_in_kiev) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chick_in_kiev/status/1116890900918095873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>She&rsquo;s a joy isn&rsquo;t she?</p>\n<p>Not content, Lavin also dropped this tweet in response to those criticizing her vile attack on Crenshaw.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p>actually ur right i should respect his rank&hellip;his name is lieutenant commander shithead</p><p>&mdash; Talia Lavin (@chick_in_kiev) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chick_in_kiev/status/1116924455756992512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Mocking the rank of a wounded warrior is a real good look. These are the kinds of people teaching at liberal universities and writing at major newspapers. I can&rsquo;t imagine why the media has such a credibility crisis, can you?</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s ironic about this is that Lavin was complaining just weeks ago that people wouldn&rsquo;t leave her alone.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p>this is the fourth time i have been mentioned on fox news this year and i am not an interesting or significant person with any power! leave me alone!</p><p>&mdash; Talia Lavin (@chick_in_kiev) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chick_in_kiev/status/1108913198592393217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 22, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Pro tip: If you want to be left alone, don&rsquo;t go around trashing veterans who did absolutely nothing wrong. Crenshaw was simply pointing out that it was absurd for AOC to question his care for the victims of 9/11. No one forced Lavin to snap back by mocking him and calling him a &ldquo;****head&rdquo; multiple times.</p>\n<p>This woman has serious issues. I don&rsquo;t just mean she&rsquo;s a partisan. I mean she comes across as unstable. The fact that she&rsquo;s gotten as far as she has in her profession is yet another testament to what a garbage dump modern, mainstream journalism is. It&rsquo;s a profession full of people who consistently fail up while accomplishing nothing of note. Some conservatives still believe the mainstream press as currently constituted holds intrinsic value to our governance, but I can&rsquo;t agree. I have no issue with market forces reducing their reach. The less Talia Lavin&rsquo;s influencing Americans, the better.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Enjoying the read?

                "text": "I\u2019m talking about Talia Lavin, made famous for once accusing a disabled ICE agent of being a nazi because he had a tattoo of his former unit on his arm. He lost both of his legs while serving in said unit in Afghanistan. She was a \u201cfact-checker\u201d at The New Yorker at the time. After that episode, she eventually moved on to NYU, where she now teaches other young \u201cjournalists\u201d how to also make stuff up and slander military veterans.\nWell, she\u2019s apparently got a thing for aiming vile language toward injured soldiers because she\u2019s doing it again.\nThis time Rep. Dan Crenshaw is her target and it started with this tweet.\nThis week was a new low in partisanship & dishonesty.\nI watched in disbelief as some covered for Omar by coming after me with lies & absurd claims that I don\u2019t support 9/11 victims.\nWhat a disgusting, dishonest tactic.\nWhy turn this into a political football?\nFull NBC int: pic.twitter.com/sVXvzHDPnP\n\u2014 Rep. Dan Crenshaw (@RepDanCrenshaw) April 12, 2019\nCrenshaw was speaking of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who thought it would be smart to insinuate that a guy who lost an eye in combat fighting in response to 9/11 didn\u2019t actually care about the victims. If only he had tended bar instead. Then he\u2019d be a real hero, but I digress.\nLavin apparently took issue with Crenshaw not treating AOC with kid gloves.\nthe real victim, captain shithead, speaks https://t.co/1Yeu10YuEY\n\u2014 Talia Lavin (@chick_in_kiev) April 13, 2019\nShe\u2019s a joy isn\u2019t she?\nNot content, Lavin also dropped this tweet in response to those criticizing her vile attack on Crenshaw.\nactually ur right i should respect his rank\u2026his name is lieutenant commander shithead\n\u2014 Talia Lavin (@chick_in_kiev) April 13, 2019\nMocking the rank of a wounded warrior is a real good look. These are the kinds of people teaching at liberal universities and writing at major newspapers. I can\u2019t imagine why the media has such a credibility crisis, can you?\nWhat\u2019s ironic about this is that Lavin was complaining just weeks ago that people wouldn\u2019t leave her alone.\nthis is the fourth time i have been mentioned on fox news this year and i am not an interesting or significant person with any power! leave me alone!\n\u2014 Talia Lavin (@chick_in_kiev) March 22, 2019\nPro tip: If you want to be left alone, don\u2019t go around trashing veterans who did absolutely nothing wrong. Crenshaw was simply pointing out that it was absurd for AOC to question his care for the victims of 9/11. No one forced Lavin to snap back by mocking him and calling him a \u201c****head\u201d multiple times.\nThis woman has serious issues. I don\u2019t just mean she\u2019s a partisan. I mean she comes across as unstable. The fact that she\u2019s gotten as far as she has in her profession is yet another testament to what a garbage dump modern, mainstream journalism is. It\u2019s a profession full of people who consistently fail up while accomplishing nothing of note. Some conservatives still believe the mainstream press as currently constituted holds intrinsic value to our governance, but I can\u2019t agree. I have no issue with market forces reducing their reach. The less Talia Lavin\u2019s influencing Americans, the better.\nEnjoying the read? Please visit my archive and check out some of my latest articles.\nI\u2019ve got a new twitter! Please help by following @bonchieredstate.",

As they purportedly made history getting elected, and have repeatedly made news following, they have also made things tough for party leadership. At a time when the Democrats expected to be dominating the narrative and promoting agenda items they have also spent copious amounts of time cleaning up behind the rambunctious newcomers.</p>\n<p>Ilhan Omar in particular seems intent on being as controversial and unapologetic as possible, and the recent resolution called on by party leaders to deal with her controversies did more harm than help. The House Dems rewrote their resolution to address Omar&rsquo;s anti-Semitism so much that they completely neutered the document, diluting the message to a point that it meant nothing and ultimately they could not even name the problematic politician in its final version. It was a laughable farce.</p>\n<p>As a result Omar has felt emboldened. By avoiding even so much as a slap on the wrist she has been just as outspoken and intemperate as she had been prior to her supposed disciplinary resolution. Omar recently sent a response to MSNBC producer Kyle Griffin on Twitter as he reported on a proposed hearing the House Judiciary Committee wants to call to address hate crimes. (The mirth of the House addressing hate-crime after giving Omar such a blatant Pass is almost too much to continue.)</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p>It&rsquo;s overdue! Far-right extremists were linked to every extremist murder in the U.S. last year, including the Tree of Life and Parkland shootings. <br> <br>They are not operating in a vacuum. This is a crisis and it deserves national attention. <a href=\"https://t.co/i2buqaYGpA\">https://t.co/i2buqaYGpA</a></p><p>&mdash; Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1107789621105176576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/sister-toldjah/2020/02/05/your-job-nikki-haley-schools-squad-on-what-house-representative-actually-is-after-aoc-skips-sotu/\"><figure><img src=\"https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NikkiHaleyAPPhoto.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Trending</figcaption></figure></a> </p>\n<p>I may need to apologize, but my ears tend to curl forward with any mention of the Parkland shooting, and to see this firebrand attempt to politicize that tragedy is too much to let go by. In a follow up tweet to this hyperbolic divisiveness the Congresswoman who traffics in defaming Jews on the regular offers up a link to a piece from the Anti Defamation League, and upon reading you are posed with a real quandary: Did Omar even read the piece and (the bigger mystery) did the ADL headline writer even read it???</p>\n<p>What we are dealing with here is the desire by the ADL to sell a narrative, and have us take their word for it. It entails searching out the actual report to find out that their claim &mdash; and Ilhan Omar&rsquo;s &mdash; is rooted in hysteria, not facts. In their own lengthy report there are deep efforts to paint every killer as a &ldquo;right-wing Supremacist&rdquo;, even though the ADL frequently draws a completely different conclusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Parkland, Florida, February 14, 2018</strong>: <em>The school itself was not a likely white supremacist target, nor did Cruz seem to target his victims by race, religion or ethnicity. However, little evidence has so far emerged to suggest that the MSDHS shooting spree itself was conducted as a white supremacist attack. In the end, however, it is not clear to what extent Cruz&rsquo;s white supremacist beliefs may have played a role in the killings. Because of this uncertainty, Cruz&rsquo;s killings have been listed here as non-ideological.</em><br>\n&mdash; This is the lead example in the report, and one Omar felt the need to note in her tweet. Non-Ideological, but listed as proof of right-wing extremism all the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, October 27, 2018</strong>:</p>\n<p>&mdash; Robert Bowers opened fire inside a synagogue killing 11. What the report fails to note is that Bowers despised President Trump, and his violence was apparently inspired by the President&rsquo;s support of Israel and Jewish citizens. This places Bowers in a camp much closer to Ilhan Omar.</p>\n<p><strong>Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, March 12, 2018:</strong> <em>Corey Johnson, 17, killed a 13-year-old and severely injured two others in a stabbing spree: In the year before the attack he had</em><br>\n<em>become interested in radical Islam (and had even been reported to the FBI by local law enforcement). After his arrest, Johnson reportedly told investigators he had stabbed his victims &ldquo;because of his Muslim faith&rdquo;.</em><br>\n&mdash; Is Ilhan Omar actually comfortable calling those who murder in the name of their Muslim faith &ldquo;right-wing extremists&rdquo;?! That could explain quite a bit.</p>\n<p><b>Nashville, Tennessee, April 22, 2018</b>: <em>Travis Reinking opened fire inside a Waffle House, killing four: Reinking also has a serious history of mental illness and the shooting appears to have been non-ideological in nature; he has been ruled incompetent to stand trial.</em><br>\n&mdash; Non-Ideological, and attributed to mental illness, but still tabulated here.</p>\n<p><strong>Sumter, South Carolina, August 11, 2018:</strong> <em>Demetrius Alexander Brown, a self-proclaimed Moorish sovereign citizen, was arrested for the fatal shooting of Sharmine Pack following a dispute about a vehicle sale at an auto repair shop.</em><br>\n&mdash; Is violence over a car sale &ldquo;extremist violence&rdquo;? Brown was affiliated with the Moorish Sovereign Citizens, a group that declares they are African society members with no allegiance to state and federal rules of law. In other words, they are Black Nationalists.</p>\n<p><strong>Robstown, Texas, July 27, 2018:</strong> <em>Richard Starry shot and killed four relatives at a local nursing center and at his home in an apparent act of domestic violence before killing himself. According to local media, Starry had been a member of a white supremacist group while in prison.</em><br>\n&mdash; The ADL recognizes this as a domestic violence situation, but since he was a member of the group they chalk that up statistically</p>\n<p><strong>Abingdon, Virginia, May 4, 2018:</strong> <em>Roger Melvin Tackett was charged with first degree murder and other crimes after fatally shooting an acquaintance following a dispute.</em><br>\n&mdash; Okay, so how was this &ldquo;right-wing extremism&rdquo; exactly?<br>\n<em>According to police, Tackett has multiple white supremacist tattoos.</em><br>\n&mdash; Ah, there it is. So we are not actually tabulating incidents any longer, just any tangential evidence will do</p>\n<p><strong>Dothan, Alabama, June 4, 2018:</strong> <em>James Mathis, a member of the Georgia-based white supremacist prison gang Ghostface Gangsters, and his wife, Amanda Oakes, allegedly killed their six-month-old son and put his body in a freezer in a hotel room.</em><br>\n&mdash; I do not even know how this manages to qualify.</p>\n<p><strong>Athens, Georgia, May 11, 2018:</strong> <em>Following a family argument, Malachi Qaadir Dorns, 19, stabbed his mother and older brother multiple times, wounding his mother and killing his brother. In an earlier arrest, Dornss told police that he was a sovereign citizen.</em><br>\n&mdash; Domestic violence&hellip;again, but he tried to dodge responsibility via nationalism, we guess???</p>\n<p><strong>Locust Grove, Georgia, February 19, 2018:</strong> <em>Tierre Guthrie, a Moorish sovereign citizen, shot and killed a Locust Grove police officer when the officer and two Henry County sheriff&rsquo;s deputies tried to take Guthrie into custody for a failure to appear warrant. Both deputies were wounded but survived. Guthrie, who was himself shot four times in the firefight, died at the scene.</em><br>\n&mdash; Another Black Nationalist we will pretend is white right-wing extremism</p>\n<p>This is what it takes in our modern era to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; the hatred of those we disagree with politically. Evidence need not actually display the claim, the claim is enough &mdash; and thus hatred is proven. It is up to us to actually dig through the claims and verify if the stated charges are actually accurate or not, and even by then when shown to be wildly inaccurate the impression has been entrenched and the animosity taken root.</p>\n<p>My question for Rep. Omar is a simple one: As a leader in DC, will you ever make efforts to lead and unify, or is your entire existence predicated on sowing division and creating tensions between groups?</p>\n<p>**

                "text": "The freshman class of the new Democrat-controlled Congress has had a tough go of things for their party. As they purportedly made history getting elected, and have repeatedly made news following, they have also made things tough for party leadership. At a time when the Democrats expected to be dominating the narrative and promoting agenda items they have also spent copious amounts of time cleaning up behind the rambunctious newcomers.\nIlhan Omar in particular seems intent on being as controversial and unapologetic as possible, and the recent resolution called on by party leaders to deal with her controversies did more harm than help. The House Dems rewrote their resolution to address Omar\u2019s anti-Semitism so much that they completely neutered the document, diluting the message to a point that it meant nothing and ultimately they could not even name the problematic politician in its final version. It was a laughable farce.\nAs a result Omar has felt emboldened. By avoiding even so much as a slap on the wrist she has been just as outspoken and intemperate as she had been prior to her supposed disciplinary resolution. Omar recently sent a response to MSNBC producer Kyle Griffin on Twitter as he reported on a proposed hearing the House Judiciary Committee wants to call to address hate crimes. (The mirth of the House addressing hate-crime after giving Omar such a blatant Pass is almost too much to continue.)\nIt\u2019s overdue! Far-right extremists were linked to every extremist murder in the U.S. last year, including the Tree of Life and Parkland shootings.\nThey are not operating in a vacuum. This is a crisis and it deserves national attention. https://t.co/i2buqaYGpA\n\u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) March 18, 2019\nI may need to apologize, but my ears tend to curl forward with any mention of the Parkland shooting, and to see this firebrand attempt to politicize that tragedy is too much to let go by. In a follow up tweet to this hyperbolic divisiveness the Congresswoman who traffics in defaming Jews on the regular offers up a link to a piece from the Anti Defamation League, and upon reading you are posed with a real quandary: Did Omar even read the piece and (the bigger mystery) did the ADL headline writer even read it???\nWhat we are dealing with here is the desire by the ADL to sell a narrative, and have us take their word for it. It entails searching out the actual report to find out that their claim \u2014 and Ilhan Omar\u2019s \u2014 is rooted in hysteria, not facts. In their own lengthy report there are deep efforts to paint every killer as a \u201cright-wing Supremacist\u201d, even though the ADL frequently draws a completely different conclusion.\nParkland, Florida, February 14, 2018: The school itself was not a likely white supremacist target, nor did Cruz seem to target his victims by race, religion or ethnicity. However, little evidence has so far emerged to suggest that the MSDHS shooting spree itself was conducted as a white supremacist attack. In the end, however, it is not clear to what extent Cruz\u2019s white supremacist beliefs may have played a role in the killings. Because of this uncertainty, Cruz\u2019s killings have been listed here as non-ideological.\n\u2014 This is the lead example in the report, and one Omar felt the need to note in her tweet. Non-Ideological, but listed as proof of right-wing extremism all the same.\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, October 27, 2018:\n\u2014 Robert Bowers opened fire inside a synagogue killing 11. What the report fails to note is that Bowers despised President Trump, and his violence was apparently inspired by the President\u2019s support of Israel and Jewish citizens. This places Bowers in a camp much closer to Ilhan Omar.\nPalm Beach Gardens, Florida, March 12, 2018: Corey Johnson, 17, killed a 13-year-old and severely injured two others in a stabbing spree: In the year before the attack he had\nbecome interested in radical Islam (and had even been reported to the FBI by local law enforcement). After his arrest, Johnson reportedly told investigators he had stabbed his victims \u201cbecause of his Muslim faith\u201d.\n\u2014 Is Ilhan Omar actually comfortable calling those who murder in the name of their Muslim faith \u201cright-wing extremists\u201d?! That could explain quite a bit.\nNashville, Tennessee, April 22, 2018: Travis Reinking opened fire inside a Waffle House, killing four: Reinking also has a serious history of mental illness and the shooting appears to have been non-ideological in nature; he has been ruled incompetent to stand trial.\n\u2014 Non-Ideological, and attributed to mental illness, but still tabulated here.\nSumter, South Carolina, August 11, 2018: Demetrius Alexander Brown, a self-proclaimed Moorish sovereign citizen, was arrested for the fatal shooting of Sharmine Pack following a dispute about a vehicle sale at an auto repair shop.\n\u2014 Is violence over a car sale \u201cextremist violence\u201d? Brown was affiliated with the Moorish Sovereign Citizens, a group that declares they are African society members with no allegiance to state and federal rules of law. In other words, they are Black Nationalists.\nRobstown, Texas, July 27, 2018: Richard Starry shot and killed four relatives at a local nursing center and at his home in an apparent act of domestic violence before killing himself. According to local media, Starry had been a member of a white supremacist group while in prison.\n\u2014 The ADL recognizes this as a domestic violence situation, but since he was a member of the group they chalk that up statistically\nAbingdon, Virginia, May 4, 2018: Roger Melvin Tackett was charged with first degree murder and other crimes after fatally shooting an acquaintance following a dispute.\n\u2014 Okay, so how was this \u201cright-wing extremism\u201d exactly?\nAccording to police, Tackett has multiple white supremacist tattoos.\n\u2014 Ah, there it is. So we are not actually tabulating incidents any longer, just any tangential evidence will do\nDothan, Alabama, June 4, 2018: James Mathis, a member of the Georgia-based white supremacist prison gang Ghostface Gangsters, and his wife, Amanda Oakes, allegedly killed their six-month-old son and put his body in a freezer in a hotel room.\n\u2014 I do not even know how this manages to qualify.\nAthens, Georgia, May 11, 2018: Following a family argument, Malachi Qaadir Dorns, 19, stabbed his mother and older brother multiple times, wounding his mother and killing his brother. In an earlier arrest, Dornss told police that he was a sovereign citizen.\n\u2014 Domestic violence\u2026again, but he tried to dodge responsibility via nationalism, we guess???\nLocust Grove, Georgia, February 19, 2018: Tierre Guthrie, a Moorish sovereign citizen, shot and killed a Locust Grove police officer when the officer and two Henry County sheriff\u2019s deputies tried to take Guthrie into custody for a failure to appear warrant. Both deputies were wounded but survived. Guthrie, who was himself shot four times in the firefight, died at the scene.\n\u2014 Another Black Nationalist we will pretend is white right-wing extremism\nThis is what it takes in our modern era to \u201cprove\u201d the hatred of those we disagree with politically. Evidence need not actually display the claim, the claim is enough \u2014 and thus hatred is proven. It is up to us to actually dig through the claims and verify if the stated charges are actually accurate or not, and even by then when shown to be wildly inaccurate the impression has been entrenched and the animosity taken root.\nMy question for Rep. Omar is a simple one: As a leader in DC, will you ever make efforts to lead and unify, or is your entire existence predicated on sowing division and creating tensions between groups?\n** for more entertainment, political, or bad movie content follow me on Twitter @MartiniShark",

Needless to say, if you&rsquo;re on the right, you can expect not to receive fair treatment.</p>\n<p>For a long time, corporations did their best to present an illusion that there was no practiced bias within, but between examples and undercover footage, that bias became undeniable, even as people like Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey were telling Congress that there wasn&rsquo;t any.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Dorsey himself admitted that there was <a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2019/02/11/twitter-drops-pretense-non-bias-ceo-tosses-neutral-stance-charade/\">no longer any room for neutrality</a> at Twitter.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump Jr. is one of the high-profile figures raising the alarm about this, and he appeared on Tucker Carlson&rsquo;s Fox News show on Monday to highlight some of the punishments put on the right for simply interacting with him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/nick-arama/2020/02/05/kevin-mccarthy-does-it-again-absolutely-nukes-pelosi-on-impeachment/\"><figure><img src=\"https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-05-at-10.23.24-PM.png\"></img><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/nick-arama/2020/02/05/kevin-mccarthy-does-it-again-absolutely-nukes-pelosi-on-impeachment/\">Kevin McCarthy Does It Again, Absolutely Nukes Pelosi on Impeachment with Three Perfect Words</a></figcaption></figure></a> </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do you think, you talked to a lot of Republicans in Washington, do you think they understand the threat of woke capitalism, the alliance between the activist left and big business that is shutting down speech?&rdquo; Carlson asked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have a platform to actually do something about it. There are guys, <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/02/19/mccarthy-omar-fundraising-hamas-linked-organization/\">Kevin McCarthy</a> has been pretty vocal about it, but the reality is that nothing has changed,&rdquo; Trump Jr. answered. &ldquo;I put up an Instagram post two weeks ago about the Smollett thing because I had the gall to be a little bit cynical about the entire ridiculous situation that was laid out and Instagram just deleted it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump noted that he made a post about Smollett last week, which Instagram took down. Upon using his platform to call them out, Instagram said they did so &ldquo;in error.&rdquo; Trump says as he called them out, he was bombarded with messages from Americans that have been treated this way, but dont&rsquo; have the platform he does.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I sort of responded in my normal fashion rather aggressively, saying, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with this here? Is the problem yada yada?&rsquo; and I got inundated, Tucker,&rdquo; said Trump. &ldquo;Hundreds of people sending me DMs: &lsquo;Don, my account was shut down because I tried liking one of your tweets, or I tried liking one of your father&rsquo;s Instagram posts that was like him and his grandchildren, nothing even controversial, and time and time again, I&rsquo;ve had to follow you, Don, three times in the last week because they keep on unfollowing you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So free speech doesn&rsquo;t mean anything if people can&rsquo;t hear you speak. And this alliance between the activist Left and big corporations is preventing people from being heard,&rdquo; Carlson responded. &ldquo;So it is, in effect, an attack on free speech. The media benefits from our freedom of speech. They are the prime beneficiaries of the First Amendment and yet, they don&rsquo;t even cover it and places like CNN actually encourage companies to the de-platform voices they don&rsquo;t think should be heard.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Again, I think the majority of the press are now left-wing activists. They are on the side of that. They are not on the side that is being stymied, they are not on the side that is being oppressed,&rdquo; Trump Jr. added. &ldquo;Guys like me, again, I can do this because I have a big platform, I have a big soap box, I can get it out there but some of the little guys, they can&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t have that ability.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2_8-dVIHv8?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that as we march into 2020, Silicon Valley companies seem to be ramping up the suspensions and bans.

Needless to say, if you\u2019re on the right, you can expect not to receive fair treatment.\nFor a long time, corporations did their best to present an illusion that there was no practiced bias within, but between examples and undercover footage, that bias became undeniable, even as people like Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey were telling Congress that there wasn\u2019t any.\nEventually, Dorsey himself admitted that there was no longer any room for neutrality at Twitter.\nDonald Trump Jr. is one of the high-profile figures raising the alarm about this, and he appeared on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News show on Monday to highlight some of the punishments put on the right for simply interacting with him.\n\u201cDo you think, you talked to a lot of Republicans in Washington, do you think they understand the threat of woke capitalism, the alliance between the activist left and big business that is shutting down speech?\u201d Carlson asked.\n\u201cI have a platform to actually do something about it. There are guys, Kevin McCarthy has been pretty vocal about it, but the reality is that nothing has changed,\u201d Trump Jr. answered. \u201cI put up an Instagram post two weeks ago about the Smollett thing because I had the gall to be a little bit cynical about the entire ridiculous situation that was laid out and Instagram just deleted it.\u201d\nTrump noted that he made a post about Smollett last week, which Instagram took down. Upon using his platform to call them out, Instagram said they did so \u201cin error.\u201d Trump says as he called them out, he was bombarded with messages from Americans that have been treated this way, but dont\u2019 have the platform he does.\n\u201cI sort of responded in my normal fashion rather aggressively, saying, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with this here? Is the problem yada yada?\u2019 and I got inundated, Tucker,\u201d said Trump. \u201cHundreds of people sending me DMs: \u2018Don, my account was shut down because I tried liking one of your tweets, or I tried liking one of your father\u2019s Instagram posts that was like him and his grandchildren, nothing even controversial, and time and time again, I\u2019ve had to follow you, Don, three times in the last week because they keep on unfollowing you.\u201d\n\u201cSo free speech doesn\u2019t mean anything if people can\u2019t hear you speak. And this alliance between the activist Left and big corporations is preventing people from being heard,\u201d Carlson responded. \u201cSo it is, in effect, an attack on free speech. The media benefits from our freedom of speech. They are the prime beneficiaries of the First Amendment and yet, they don\u2019t even cover it and places like CNN actually encourage companies to the de-platform voices they don\u2019t think should be heard.\u201d\n\u201cAgain, I think the majority of the press are now left-wing activists. They are on the side of that. They are not on the side that is being stymied, they are not on the side that is being oppressed,\u201d Trump Jr. added. \u201cGuys like me, again, I can do this because I have a big platform, I have a big soap box, I can get it out there but some of the little guys, they can\u2019t, they don\u2019t have that ability.\u201d\nIt\u2019s interesting that as we march into 2020, Silicon Valley companies seem to be ramping up the suspensions and bans. The deplatforming of the American right is highly beneficial to the left, whose messages only survive in a vacuum, and tend to whither in an information exchange.\nRecently, former Nigel Farage aid Raheem Kassam was also suspended from Facebook, but Facebook would not provide a specific reason why.\nTrump also weighed in on this, jokingly foretelling that they\u2019ll tell him they did it in error, and noting it\u2019s funny how all these accidents happen in one direction.\nI\u2019m sure this was an \u201caccident\u201d like I\u2019ve been hearing from the social media masters. Funny that the accidents only happen one way. https://t.co/OTenZwaeCJ\n\u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 26, 2019",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D) runs her mouth about, but doesn\u2019t seem to understand.\nIn this episode, everyone\u2019s least liked democratic socialist responded to Rahm Emanuel going on MSNBC and saying that the hard-leftism spouted by the likes of Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota is only putting the rest of the Democrats in a disadvantageous position due to the distractions caused by socialist ideals and radical environmental solutions.\nRahm made it very clear that the energy the freshman Democrats are bringing is good, but that progressive policies like the kind they advocate aren\u2019t representative of middle America.\nRahm Emanuel suggests that The Bronx and Minneapolis are not \"the middle of the country\" and that @AOC + @IlhanMN's policies don't represent \"the middle\" either.\nEmanuel represents a deep blue Chicago and is against a Green New Deal and Medicare for All \u2013 so what's his excuse? pic.twitter.com/SdwnwWXU2y\n\u2014 Justice Democrats (@justicedems) March 15, 2019\nThis angered Ocasio-Cortez, who took to Twitter to counter Emanuel\u2019s claims by touting the fact that \u201cIlhan reps Minnesota\u201d and that Rep. Rashida Tlaib \u201creps Michigan.\u201d\n\u201cThe progressive message WON in 2016 primaries,\u201d tweeted Ocasio-Cortez.\nCan someone break down the \u201cprogressivism doesn\u2019t work in the midwest\u201d thing?\n\u2013 Ilhan reps Minnesota\n\u2013 Rashida reps Michigan\n\u2013 #GreenNewDeal + #MedicareForAll are polling as top issues in Iowa\n\u2013 The progressive message WON in 2016 primaries\nSo what do these folks really mean? https://t.co/3MxN5DLXEn\n\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 15, 2019\nThe only problem here is that Ocasio-Cortez is wrong about Omar\u2019s, Tlaib\u2019s, or even her reach. Representatives only represent a district within the state, not the state itself. There are many districts within a state, and not all of them are as blue as those three Democratic freshmen would like.\nAs Twitchy pointed out, Twitter moved to correct her false assumption, starting with one user who pointed out that they rep ONE blue district within their respective states.\nThey don\u2019t represent Michigan or Minnesota, they represent blue districts in those states.\n\u2014 Mikey (@mikeyoranje88) March 16, 2019\nThey rep blue districts in those particular states, they aren't statewide candidates. Don't mislead.\n\u2014 Speaker Pelosi, we have been waiting for you (@jahosiphats) March 16, 2019\nIn fact, compared to the number of people living in the midwest they don\u2019t represent, their just one pebble in a mountain of rocks.\nThose two representatives represent approximately 1.5 million people together they Midwest has well over 100 million people. I don't think listing those 2 reps, and anecdotal support in Democratic primaries in 2016 and some polls about issues that are important to those voting\u2026\n\u2014 Irish O'Apple Jokes (@goodapplejokes) March 16, 2019\n\u2026in Democratic primaries in Iowa prove anything about progressivism working.\nEvidence of progressivism working would be results from progressive policies, not polls of support for bills and representatives.\n\u2014 Irish O'Apple Jokes (@goodapplejokes) March 16, 2019\nIt seems as if AOC is trying to make the things she supports, and her fellow freshman radicals, seem more important than they actually are.\nThis isn\u2019t surprising coming from someone like Ocasio-Cortez, who tends to forget she\u2019s even an elected representative sometimes, and likes to say things like \u201cwe\u2019re in charge\u201d\u2026\nYup. If you don\u2019t like the #GreenNewDeal, then come up with your own ambitious, on-scale proposal to address the global climate crisis.\nUntil then, we\u2019re in charge \u2013 and you\u2019re just shouting from the cheap seats. https://t.co/h3KSJhHqDN\n\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 23, 2019\nAnd call herself \u201cthe boss.\u201d\nSocialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on the widespread criticism of her Green New Deal: \"I\u2019m like, you try. \u2026 Until you do it, I\u2019m the boss! How about that?!\" pic.twitter.com/vkp15KBttd\n\u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) February 24, 2019\nIf Ocasio-Cortez truly wants to get ahead, then she\u2019d be better off \u2014 and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this \u2014 heed Rahm Emanuel advice, and pull back on the throttle. Her exuberance for socialistic change in America is turning people off. While more people than ever know who she is, her unfavorability rating is climbing by double digits.",

Only four percent say there&rsquo;s too little.</p>\n<p>However, 37 percent say that just the right amount of politics has found its way into SNL, beating out those who think it has gotten too political.

When asked if they&rsquo;d like to see Joe Biden appear on SNL, 32 percent said yes, while 33 percent said no.</p>\n<p>The numbers only sink for other candidates. Thirty percent want Bernie Sanders to appear on SNL vs. 35 who don&rsquo;t. Only 21 percent want to see Kamala Harris on SNL vs. 31 percent who&rsquo;d rather not see her star. Even Beto O&rsquo;Rourke clocks in at only 20 percent of those who would like to see him on, as opposed to 31 percent who&rsquo;d rather he keep away.</p>\n<p>SNL has become something of a political lightning rod lately, going through many sketches that tend to portray Republicans in a highly negative light, while rarely taking the same kind of shots at Democratic lawmakers. It especially loves to take shots at President Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>Trump lashed out at SNL, suggesting that courts should get involved due to the bias. <a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2018/12/18/dan-crenshaw-defends-snl-trumps-assertion-media-bias-tested-courts/\">He was rebuffed by Texas Republican Dan Crenshaw</a>, who told Trump that it is legal, and needs to remain so in order to keep the 1st Amendment.</p>\n<p>This same survey found that about the same percentage of Americans don&rsquo;t watch late night comedy shows either. Most tune into Stephen Colbert who they find expresses the most left-leaning politics, but overall Jimmy Fallon is the most liked, and also considered the least political.</p>\n<figure><iframe

                "text": "A new Morning Consult/Hollywood Reporter Poll found that when it comes to the weekend comedy show, 31 percent say that they\u2019ve injected too much politics into it. Only four percent say there\u2019s too little.\nHowever, 37 percent say that just the right amount of politics has found its way into SNL, beating out those who think it has gotten too political. Still, while those who watch think the proverbial porridge is just right, most of America doesn\u2019t seem to want to eat it at all.\nThe survey found that 61 percent of Americans don\u2019t watch SNL, compared to 39 percent who do.\nInterestingly, when it comes to politicians appearing on the show, most of America would rather lawmakers stay away. When asked if they\u2019d like to see Joe Biden appear on SNL, 32 percent said yes, while 33 percent said no.\nThe numbers only sink for other candidates. Thirty percent want Bernie Sanders to appear on SNL vs. 35 who don\u2019t. Only 21 percent want to see Kamala Harris on SNL vs. 31 percent who\u2019d rather not see her star. Even Beto O\u2019Rourke clocks in at only 20 percent of those who would like to see him on, as opposed to 31 percent who\u2019d rather he keep away.\nSNL has become something of a political lightning rod lately, going through many sketches that tend to portray Republicans in a highly negative light, while rarely taking the same kind of shots at Democratic lawmakers. It especially loves to take shots at President Donald Trump.\nTrump lashed out at SNL, suggesting that courts should get involved due to the bias. He was rebuffed by Texas Republican Dan Crenshaw, who told Trump that it is legal, and needs to remain so in order to keep the 1st Amendment.\nThis same survey found that about the same percentage of Americans don\u2019t watch late night comedy shows either. Most tune into Stephen Colbert who they find expresses the most left-leaning politics, but overall Jimmy Fallon is the most liked, and also considered the least political.",

Jim Jordan, ranking member of the Oversight Committee, sent to Cummings on Monday.</p>\n<p>She <a href=\"https://saraacarter.com/reps-elijah-cummings-maxine-waters-and-adam-schiff-sign-secret-mous-to-target-trump/\">reports</a> that, &ldquo;The letter also indicates that other MOUs have apparently been signed and agreed to with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Ca, who has promised to continue investigations into the president despite findings by Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s office that there was no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A congressional official with knowledge of the MOUs <a href=\"https://saraacarter.com/reps-elijah-cummings-maxine-waters-and-adam-schiff-sign-secret-mous-to-target-trump/\">told Carter</a>, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d describe (the MOUs) as an agreement to conspire and coordinate their efforts to attack and investigate POTUS. This is not how committee&rsquo;s normally operate. Dems aren&rsquo;t interested in legislating. Only attacking POTUS.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://saraacarter.com/reps-elijah-cummings-maxine-waters-and-adam-schiff-sign-secret-mous-to-target-trump/\">In his letter</a> to Cummings, Jordan condemned the secret MOUs and wrote that Democrats:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Did not consult with Republican Members of the Committee or allow Members to consider and debate the terms of your MOU before executing the MOU with Chairwoman Waters. You did not disclose the MOU&rsquo;s existence to Members or the American people until after I raised the matter.</p><p>If you intend to continue to use the Committee&rsquo;s limited resources to attack President Trump for political gain, I hope that you will at least be transparent about your actions. Your ability to function as a fair and unbiased finder of fact is now at grave risk. The Members of the Committee&mdash;and, more importantly, the American citizens we represent&mdash;deserve to know exactly how you are leading this Committee. I look forward to your detailed answers to these questions.</p></blockquote>\n<ol><li><blockquote><p>How many MOUs with committee chairpersons have you signed as Chairman since the beginning of the 116th Congress?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Would you provide the Committee with a detailed list of the other MOUs you have signed, including their dates, signatories, and topics?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Why did you not publicly disclose that you had signed MOUs with committee chairpersons?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Will you publicly disclose all the MOUs you have signed as Chairman since the beginning of the 116th Congress?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Why did you choose not to consult with any Republican Members before signing these MOUs?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Have you signed any MOUs as Chairman with any entities outside of the House Representatives relating to the Committee&rsquo;s oversight or legislative work?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>To the extent your MOUs create duties for the Committee that conflict with the Rules of the House of Representatives or the Rules of the Committee, which duties prevail?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>The Rules of the Committee for the 116th Congress do not authorize the Chairman to bind the Committee through an MOU.<a href=\"applewebdata://DBD73137-4AD0-4781-81EA-5F605E553303#_ftn2\">[2]</a>Could you explain the specific authority that allows you to bind the Committee through an MOU without first obtaining approval through a vote of the Committee?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>As I understand your MOU with Chairwoman Waters, you have committed to sharing Committee information with the Financial Services Committee. This provision of your MOU may conflict with Rules of the House of Representatives and the Committee&rsquo;s whistleblower protocol, which requires the Committee to keep some Committee information confidential. Will you still protect the confidentiality of whistleblower information notwithstanding your apparent obligation to share it with the Financial Services Committee?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>As I understand your MOU with Chairwoman Waters, you have agreed to consult with her before issuing a subpoena. Do you intend to consult with Chairwoman Waters before or after you consult with me, as required by Committee Rules? If I object to your proposed subpoena, do you intend to consult with Chairwoman Waters before or after the Committee votes, as you promised in the Committee&rsquo;s organizing meeting?</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>As I understand your MOU with Chairwoman Waters, you have declined to include any provision protecting the Minority&rsquo;s rights to documentary or testimonial information. Can you guarantee that Minority Members will have the same access to documentary or testimonial information under this MOU as we do in every other Committee inquiry?</p></blockquote></li></ol>\n<p>None of us can possibly be shocked by this. Most of the Committee chairs have stated their plans to pursue Trump publicly and have already begun.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/alexparker/2020/02/05/778361/\"><figure><img src=\"https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/james-carville-msnbc-iowa-SCREENSHOT.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Trending</figcaption></figure></a> </p>\n<p>Although I&rsquo;m unfamiliar with MOUs, it certainly doesn&rsquo;t sound like business as usual in the United States House of Representatives. It sounds more like an agreement between mobsters.</p>\n<p>What does surprise me is that lawmakers would put these agreements in writing. It&rsquo;s <em>almost</em> as though they know they&rsquo;re all snakes and they don&rsquo;t trust each other.

                "text": "Investigative journalist Sara Carter reported that House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings and House Finance Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters allegedly \u201cexecuted a secret Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to \u201ctarget\u201d President Trump and subpoena all his financial and banking records.\u201d\nCarter obtained a copy of a letter from Rep. Jim Jordan, ranking member of the Oversight Committee, sent to Cummings on Monday.\nShe reports that, \u201cThe letter also indicates that other MOUs have apparently been signed and agreed to with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Ca, who has promised to continue investigations into the president despite findings by Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office that there was no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.\u201d\nA congressional official with knowledge of the MOUs told Carter, \u201cWe\u2019d describe (the MOUs) as an agreement to conspire and coordinate their efforts to attack and investigate POTUS. This is not how committee\u2019s normally operate. Dems aren\u2019t interested in legislating. Only attacking POTUS.\u201d\nIn his letter to Cummings, Jordan condemned the secret MOUs and wrote that Democrats:\nDid not consult with Republican Members of the Committee or allow Members to consider and debate the terms of your MOU before executing the MOU with Chairwoman Waters. You did not disclose the MOU\u2019s existence to Members or the American people until after I raised the matter.\nIf you intend to continue to use the Committee\u2019s limited resources to attack President Trump for political gain, I hope that you will at least be transparent about your actions. Your ability to function as a fair and unbiased finder of fact is now at grave risk. The Members of the Committee\u2014and, more importantly, the American citizens we represent\u2014deserve to know exactly how you are leading this Committee. I look forward to your detailed answers to these questions.\nHow many MOUs with committee chairpersons have you signed as Chairman since the beginning of the 116th Congress?\nWould you provide the Committee with a detailed list of the other MOUs you have signed, including their dates, signatories, and topics?\nWhy did you not publicly disclose that you had signed MOUs with committee chairpersons?\nWill you publicly disclose all the MOUs you have signed as Chairman since the beginning of the 116th Congress?\nWhy did you choose not to consult with any Republican Members before signing these MOUs?\nHave you signed any MOUs as Chairman with any entities outside of the House Representatives relating to the Committee\u2019s oversight or legislative work?\nTo the extent your MOUs create duties for the Committee that conflict with the Rules of the House of Representatives or the Rules of the Committee, which duties prevail?\nThe Rules of the Committee for the 116th Congress do not authorize the Chairman to bind the Committee through an MOU.[2]Could you explain the specific authority that allows you to bind the Committee through an MOU without first obtaining approval through a vote of the Committee?\nAs I understand your MOU with Chairwoman Waters, you have committed to sharing Committee information with the Financial Services Committee. This provision of your MOU may conflict with Rules of the House of Representatives and the Committee\u2019s whistleblower protocol, which requires the Committee to keep some Committee information confidential. Will you still protect the confidentiality of whistleblower information notwithstanding your apparent obligation to share it with the Financial Services Committee?\nAs I understand your MOU with Chairwoman Waters, you have agreed to consult with her before issuing a subpoena. Do you intend to consult with Chairwoman Waters before or after you consult with me, as required by Committee Rules? If I object to your proposed subpoena, do you intend to consult with Chairwoman Waters before or after the Committee votes, as you promised in the Committee\u2019s organizing meeting?\nAs I understand your MOU with Chairwoman Waters, you have declined to include any provision protecting the Minority\u2019s rights to documentary or testimonial information. Can you guarantee that Minority Members will have the same access to documentary or testimonial information under this MOU as we do in every other Committee inquiry?\nNone of us can possibly be shocked by this. Most of the Committee chairs have stated their plans to pursue Trump publicly and have already begun.\nAlthough I\u2019m unfamiliar with MOUs, it certainly doesn\u2019t sound like business as usual in the United States House of Representatives. It sounds more like an agreement between mobsters.\nWhat does surprise me is that lawmakers would put these agreements in writing. It\u2019s almost as though they know they\u2019re all snakes and they don\u2019t trust each other. Imagine that.",

Another student comes between the two, and Jones rips the banner away and throws it on the hallway floor. He then walks away.\nThe encounter took place during the high school\u2019s Double Wolf Dare Week fundraiser. Students donate a dollar in exchange for a pass to wear headgear during the school day, which is typically not allowed, said Susan Parks Schlepp, school spokeswoman.\n\u201cGiven that hats were allowed at school yesterday as part of the week-long fundraising events, there was no specific dress code violation,\u201d said Schlepp. \u201cThe student\u2019s choice to grab a classmate\u2019s property and knock his hat off did, however, violate the school\u2019s discipline policy.\u201d\nFootage of the hallway confrontation has gone viral.

That case involved an 81-year-old New Jersey man who was confronted and attacked Monday. He suffered minor injuries.\nJust this month there have been a wave of reported incidents involving Trump fans being harassed, targeted and/or assaulted because of their openly displayed support of the president. In one particularly disturbing case, a gun was pulled on a man inside of a Bowling Green, KY Sam\u2019s Club.\nThe number of reports surfacing about these attacks are causing some people to want to go out and buy MAGA merch, or wear what they already have, in a show of defiance:\nNever owned a #maga hat and never considered owning one..until today. I\u2019ve read 3 articles and watched 6 videos of ppl being assaulted because they were wearing one and I have now ordered mine #openseason #imyourhuckleberry\n\u2014 Nathan West (@NWestAVL) February 26, 2019\nI'm not even really a Trump guy, but I'm thinking I should get a MAGA hat\u2026 and a taser. https://t.co/OLZgYThFMR\n\u2014 Russ Emerson (@RussEmerson) February 27, 2019\nI am going to buy a #MAGA hat and wear it daily and dare one of these leftist punks to lay a hand on me. Would make my day.\n\u2014 Josh (@marinevet99) February 27, 2019\nI have decided to buy and wear a MAGA hat bc people are trying to remove the freedom to don one. #FreedomOfExpression #centerleft\n\u2014 Carious (@Carious1) February 27, 2019\nAre you happy now, Alyssa Milano?\nThe rise in reported cases of these politically motivated assaults are becoming epidemic in nature. We need a national conversation on this issue, right?

Presidents have been declaring National Emergencies for a few decades and it is only now that anyone bothered to wake up.</p>\n<p>Since the National Emergency Act was enacted in 1976, there have been 58 such declarations.

Puh-f***ing-leeze. Obama didn&rsquo;t even bother with Emergency Declarations to do what he wanted. In the case of DACA and DAPA he used mere memoranda from agency heads to set aside federal law. In Fast &amp; Furious, the law was ignored wholesale. And the pallets of unmarked, nonsequential, used, small denomination bank notes he sent to Iran? Where was the debate on that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/nick-arama/2020/02/05/breaking-lawmakers-file-ethics-complaint-against-pelosi-for-ripping-up-speech/\"><figure><img src=\"https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-05-at-11.40.32-PM.png\"></img><figcaption>Trending</figcaption></figure></a> </p>\n<p>Muh precious principles or craven political opportunism and virtue signaling? It is difficult to review the facts in this case (31 emergency declarations still in existence and Trump having <a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/streiff/2019/02/15/president-trumps-emergency-declaration-much-less-radical-tds-sufferers-claiming/\">access to $5 billion in funding before the emergency declaration is needed</a>) and not see the mea culpas issued by some of the Republican turncoats in <a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/sarah-rumpf/2019/02/26/breaking-house-votes-revoke-trumps-national-emergency-declaration/\">Sarah Rumpf&rsquo;s excellent write up</a> as anything but ass covering nonsense.</p>\n<p>In the big scheme of things, this is just the Democrat posturing for 2020. They are showing their base that they are doing something and that they&rsquo;d do more of it if they only held the Senate and the presidency (does that sound familiar). Should this resolution see the light of day in the Senate, and should it pass, there were not enough votes yesterday to override an inevitable veto.</p>\n<p>But this is not a good sign. Siding with the Democrats to engage in a public relations stunt to try to embarrass the president in an election year isn&rsquo;t the kind of thing that makes a lot of sense for any Republican seeking reelection. But when your political views are limited to OrangeManBad and seeking the approval of people who loathe you, these votes are understandable even if they make no political sense.</p>\n<p><em>I&rsquo;m on Facebook. <a href=\"http://fb.me/streiffredstate\">Drop by and join the fun there.</a></em><br>\n=========<br>\n=========</p>\n<p><a data-delivery=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=nSzFFfpuXy8o%2BwpcCKJd29B483RP1HPHU%2BdpIvnCydzHLEo309jCjYA9ojRRW7v9uXwuYSQ%2BhPJL4G6u6sVIgy0gwKyzmfUo%2BI7qJyJowgibsFe7au0syNOtSgQgwHt63CBEqkhuxWGG8d6aKYbaV%2Fxp4R%2BPAa43oh%2BqJxUiuA1IZ%2FdNN%2FO90FHY9Gf4kiVzJaELsTPLWoxAFx5wxB3IateL2oQRa1MZKdPoDlcslFqM7qyE1uurSZc92gSeYGTc3jqMQIEq4opPjKBcClx5AV5BZaIg7w0s6PEOekIg098aPHTV6fNoQr6JZkLAZkAHq3IiTsvxWpblaYgBrQXZ%2FgAgGMqd1ausgQToDbKcQTHarT4C0tqI1mm2ft1WYyFixp0lMMUZ6%2BKl6Xxk%2BZKSGviPoZRNLmqomf%2BBKYtsm%2B8ACD7aK7B%2BrLschA1SFr%2FnnD%2FY8%2F2CVZ9i1TIaemosvDpJhCxaxULWAOYwbPjy4%2B2mquBFqYYs3mzVuejkj4rsmXRnoKuyw8CJMNyzBxPggg6qhpcP1%2BdKBs2SQjixs%2BHiU99Kfozi67twOUdwN1e%2FPaBgACR2%2FB7sJ21LM37Pr3RAAzXE6He%2FhzVlsc3rBCBVAjB4cLi1CRTS0WbTOg4WJRn7hpR%2FSJQtGIaI5NVhpz41liIx1KJvFE0lQeVXrQh4%2BHU02zpppeix155QyUtOgW7Dd%2Bwf9l5i9HT%2BvcYe7sowlri8g%2BUuzl%2FUumqS98dimmohncmOJ1FWlyc1RaUrSKsTNH2y9DTtUiQZuhCzKHdihks31yAAtVShb7xu3yuG5tVEtZb2nGDVVJCZ%2F0ZApYjSoFd%2B298rouzp0Hpwq0Ad03zZn4WrVzahREsre9zGKLaPVgl7RZmEN6S4V8qqVU2Ok0F9cDUxfMcxFz5JD5%2F2JDGKMLBrsLbogCu2IDuWMWZHKmatl%2BsWFjQien60ehYbplp3UIfNa%2FH0YZzjepQnnL6rCHQBPtfj%2B3PFJ3IuhjxGuyvaaBBkGJfUN8o1Nef4ZnImPCz8loAC0Cs0IKUb5fZ6Jl%2FEV4a3aPRpUTumDoABOBhwPflpnVmpkB3d&s2s=1\" data-id=\"nSzFFfpuXy8o%2BwpcCKJd29B483RP1HPHU%2BdpIvnCydzHLEo309jCjYA9ojRRW7v9uXwuYSQ%2BhPJL4G6u6sVIgy0gwKyzmfUo%2BI7qJyJowgibsFe7au0syNOtSgQgwHt63CBEqkhuxWGG8d6aKYbaV%2Fxp4R%2BPAa43oh%2BqJxUiuA1IZ%2FdNN%2FO90FHY9Gf4kiVzJaELsTPLWoxAFx5wxB3IateL2oQRa1MZKdPoDlcslFqM7qyE1uurSZc92gSeYGTc3jqMQIEq4opPjKBcClx5AV5BZaIg7w0s6PEOekIg098aPHTV6fNoQr6JZkLAZkAHq3IiTsvxWpblaYgBrQXZ%2FgAgGMqd1ausgQToDbKcQTHarT4C0tqI1mm2ft1WYyFixp0lMMUZ6%2BKl6Xxk%2BZKSGviPoZRNLmqomf%2BBKYtsm%2B8ACD7aK7B%2BrLschA1SFr%2FnnD%2FY8%2F2CVZ9i1TIaemosvDpJhCxaxULWAOYwbPjy4%2B2mquBFqYYs3mzVuejkj4rsmXRnoKuyw8CJMNyzBxPggg6qhpcP1%2BdKBs2SQjixs%2BHiU99Kfozi67twOUdwN1e%2FPaBgACR2%2FB7sJ21LM37Pr3RAAzXE6He%2FhzVlsc3rBCBVAjB4cLi1CRTS0WbTOg4WJRn7hpR%2FSJQtGIaI5NVhpz41liIx1KJvFE0lQeVXrQh4%2BHU02zpppeix155QyUtOgW7Dd%2Bwf9l5i9HT%2BvcYe7sowlri8g%2BUuzl%2FUumqS98dimmohncmOJ1FWlyc1RaUrSKsTNH2y9DTtUiQZuhCzKHdihks31yAAtVShb7xu3yuG5tVEtZb2nGDVVJCZ%2F0ZApYjSoFd%2B298rouzp0Hpwq0Ad03zZn4WrVzahREsre9zGKLaPVgl7RZmEN6S4V8qqVU2Ok0F9cDUxfMcxFz5JD5%2F2JDGKMLBrsLbogCu2IDuWMWZHKmatl%2BsWFjQien60ehYbplp3UIfNa%2FH0YZzjepQnnL6rCHQBPtfj%2B3PFJ3IuhjxGuyvaaBBkGJfUN8o1Nef4ZnImPCz8loAC0Cs0IKUb5fZ6Jl%2FEV4a3aPRpUTumDoABOBhwPflpnVmpkB3d\" data-target=\"https://pro.oxfordclub.com/m/1356476?rev_campaign_id=613580\" href=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=nSzFFfpuXy8o%2BwpcCKJd29B483RP1HPHU%2BdpIvnCydzHLEo309jCjYA9ojRRW7v9uXwuYSQ%2BhPJL4G6u6sVIgy0gwKyzmfUo%2BI7qJyJowgibsFe7au0syNOtSgQgwHt63CBEqkhuxWGG8d6aKYbaV%2Fxp4R%2BPAa43oh%2BqJxUiuA1IZ%2FdNN%2FO90FHY9Gf4kiVzJaELsTPLWoxAFx5wxB3IateL2oQRa1MZKdPoDlcslFqM7qyE1uurSZc92gSeYGTc3jqMQIEq4opPjKBcClx5AV5BZaIg7w0s6PEOekIg098aPHTV6fNoQr6JZkLAZkAHq3IiTsvxWpblaYgBrQXZ%2FgAgGMqd1ausgQToDbKcQTHarT4C0tqI1mm2ft1WYyFixp0lMMUZ6%2BKl6Xxk%2BZKSGviPoZRNLmqomf%2BBKYtsm%2B8ACD7aK7B%2BrLschA1SFr%2FnnD%2FY8%2F2CVZ9i1TIaemosvDpJhCxaxULWAOYwbPjy4%2B2mquBFqYYs3mzVuejkj4rsmXRnoKuyw8CJMNyzBxPggg6qhpcP1%2BdKBs2SQjixs%2BHiU99Kfozi67twOUdwN1e%2FPaBgACR2%2FB7sJ21LM37Pr3RAAzXE6He%2FhzVlsc3rBCBVAjB4cLi1CRTS0WbTOg4WJRn7hpR%2FSJQtGIaI5NVhpz41liIx1KJvFE0lQeVXrQh4%2BHU02zpppeix155QyUtOgW7Dd%2Bwf9l5i9HT%2BvcYe7sowlri8g%2BUuzl%2FUumqS98dimmohncmOJ1FWlyc1RaUrSKsTNH2y9DTtUiQZuhCzKHdihks31yAAtVShb7xu3yuG5tVEtZb2nGDVVJCZ%2F0ZApYjSoFd%2B298rouzp0Hpwq0Ad03zZn4WrVzahREsre9zGKLaPVgl7RZmEN6S4V8qqVU2Ok0F9cDUxfMcxFz5JD5%2F2JDGKMLBrsLbogCu2IDuWMWZHKmatl%2BsWFjQien60ehYbplp3UIfNa%2FH0YZzjepQnnL6rCHQBPtfj%2B3PFJ3IuhjxGuyvaaBBkGJfUN8o1Nef4ZnImPCz8loAC0Cs0IKUb5fZ6Jl%2FEV4a3aPRpUTumDoABOBhwPflpnVmpkB3d&s2s=1\"><figure><video src=\"https://videos.revcontent.com/revcontent/video/upload/c_pad,h_240,w_426,b_blurred:400,f_mp4/v1579628040/revcontent-p0/cr_videos/9597/4213758.mp4\"> </video></figure></a></p>",

This was theater and everyone know it. Google lists, at this writing, over 750,000 references to the vote being a \u2018rebuke\u2019 of Trump. The final vote was 245-182. All Democrats who voted, voted to rescind the declaration. Thirteen Republicans crossed over to vote with the Democrats are list in this story titled, oddly enough, Meet the 13 Republicans who rebuked Trump over his national emergency.\nMichigan Rep. Justin Amash\nPennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick\nWisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher\nWashington Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler\nTexas Rep. Will Hurd\nSouth Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson\nKentucky Rep. Thomas Massie\nWashington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers\nFlorida Rep. Francis Rooney\nWisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner\nNew York Rep. Elise Stefanik\nMichigan Rep. Fred Upton\nOregon Rep. Greg Walden\nTo me, the the bizarre argument tossed about by some of the turncoats that this \u201csets a dangerous precedent\u201d is simply beyond comprehension. Presidents have been declaring National Emergencies for a few decades and it is only now that anyone bothered to wake up.\nSince the National Emergency Act was enacted in 1976, there have been 58 such declarations. Here\u2019s a list of the 31 national emergencies that are still in effect via ABC.\nNov 14, 1979: The National Emergency With Respect to Iran, in response to the Iran hostage crisis.\nNov 14, 1994: The National Emergency With Respect to the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, that combined two previous national emergencies focused on weapons of mass destruction.\nJan. 2, 1995: The National Emergency With Respect to Prohibiting Transactions with Terrorists Who Threaten to Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process placed economic sanctions in response to the Jerusalem bombing.\nMarch 15, 1995: The National Emergency With Respect to Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to the Development of Iranian Petroleum Resources was an effort to prevent potential deals between oil companies.\nOctober 21, 1995: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Assets and Prohibiting Transactions with Significant Narcotics Traffickers Centered in Colombia was declared after increased reports of drug cartels laundering money through American companies.\nMarch 1, 1996: The National Emergency With Respect to Regulations of the Anchorage and Movement of Vessels with Respect to Cuba was after civilian planes were shot down near Cuba\nNovember 3, 1997: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Sudanese Government Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Sudan implemented economic and trade sanctions.\nJune 26, 2001: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Persons Who Threaten International Stabilization Efforts in the Western Balkans imposed sanctions on those aiding Albanian insurgents in Macedonia\nAug 17, 2001: The National Emergency With Respect to Export Control Regulations renewed presidential power to control exports in a national emergency since the Export Administration Act of 1979 lapsed.\nSept 14, 2001: The National Emergency with Respect to Certain Terrorist Attacks was in response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States.\nSept 23, 2001: The National Emergency With Respect to Persons who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism was in response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\nMarch 6, 2003: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Persons Undermining Democratic Processes or Institutions in Zimbabwe was an effort to punish associates of Robert Mugabe.\nMay 22, 2003: The National Emergency With Respect to Protecting the Development Fund for Iraq and Certain Other Property in Which Iraq has an Interest was issued following the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\nMay 11, 2004: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting the Export of Certain Goods to Syria was in response to Syria supporting terrorist activity in Iraq.\nJune 16, 2006: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Certain Persons Undermining Democratic Processes or Institutions in Belarus was in response to charges of fraud in the Belarus presidential election.\nOct 27, 2006: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was in response to violence around the Congolese presidential election runoff.\nAug 1, 2007: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Persons Undermining the Sovereignty of Lebanon was in response to a breakdown of the rule of law in Lebanon.\nJune 26, 2008: The National Emergency With Respect to Continuing Certain Restrictions with Respect to North Korea cited the risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material. President Trump renewed this June 22, 2018 citing the \u201cexistence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat.\u201d\nApril 12, 2010: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Conflict in Somalia was in respect to threats posed by Somali pirates.\nFebruary 25, 2011: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property and Prohibiting Certain Transactions Related to Libya froze the assets of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.\nJuly 25, 2011: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Transnational Criminals was in response to the rise in crime by specific organizations: Los Zetas (Mexico), The Brothers\u2019 Circle (former Soviet Union countries), the Yakuza (Japan), and the Camorra (Italy).\nMay 16, 2012: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Persons Threatening the Peace, Security, or Stability of Yemen addressed political unrest within the Yemen government.\nMarch 16, 2014: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine was in response to the Russian invasion of Crimea.\nApril 3, 2014: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Certain Persons With Respect to South Sudan was in response to the ongoing civil war.\nMay 12, 2014: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Conflict in the Central African Republic was in response to violence towards humanitarian aid workers.\nMarch 8, 2015: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property and Suspending Entry of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Venezuela was in response to human rights violations.\nApril 1, 2015: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities was in response to Chinese cyber attacks on the U.S.\nNov 23, 2015: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Burundi was declared after a failed coup.\nDec 20, 2017: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking the Property of Persons Involved in Serious Human Rights Abuse or Corruption imposed sanctions on the Myanmar general for his role persecuting Rohingya Muslims.\nSept 12, 2018: The National Emergency With Respect to Imposing Certain Sanctions in the Event of Foreign Interference in a United States Election attempted to prevent any meddling with the 2018 midterm elections amid the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\nNov 27, 2018: The National Emergency With Respect to Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Nicaragua was declared by President Trump in response to violence and the Ortega regime\u2019s \u201csystematic dismantling and undermining of democratic institutions and the rule of law\u201d that constitutes an \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.\u201d\nEqually silly was the assertion by some of these people that they were afraid that some future Democrat president might do the same thing. Puh-f***ing-leeze. Obama didn\u2019t even bother with Emergency Declarations to do what he wanted. In the case of DACA and DAPA he used mere memoranda from agency heads to set aside federal law. In Fast & Furious, the law was ignored wholesale. And the pallets of unmarked, nonsequential, used, small denomination bank notes he sent to Iran? Where was the debate on that.\nMuh precious principles or craven political opportunism and virtue signaling? It is difficult to review the facts in this case (31 emergency declarations still in existence and Trump having access to $5 billion in funding before the emergency declaration is needed) and not see the mea culpas issued by some of the Republican turncoats in Sarah Rumpf\u2019s excellent write up as anything but ass covering nonsense.\nIn the big scheme of things, this is just the Democrat posturing for 2020. They are showing their base that they are doing something and that they\u2019d do more of it if they only held the Senate and the presidency (does that sound familiar). Should this resolution see the light of day in the Senate, and should it pass, there were not enough votes yesterday to override an inevitable veto.\nBut this is not a good sign. Siding with the Democrats to engage in a public relations stunt to try to embarrass the president in an election year isn\u2019t the kind of thing that makes a lot of sense for any Republican seeking reelection. But when your political views are limited to OrangeManBad and seeking the approval of people who loathe you, these votes are understandable even if they make no political sense.\nI\u2019m on Facebook. Drop by and join the fun there.\n=========\n=========",

The event today and perhaps through the end of the week is his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee where Elijah Cummings is trying to build a case for articles of impeachment to vote on during the upcoming presidential race. This is the prologue, if you will, to Cohen&rsquo;s prepared statement:</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fcvrKkS9AJc?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<blockquote>Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today.I have asked this Committee to ensure that my family be protected from Presidential threats, and that the Committee be sensitive to the questions pertaining to ongoing investigations. Thank you for your help and for your understanding.I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee&rsquo;s questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I recognize that some of you may doubt and attack me on my credibility. It is for this reason that I have incorporated into this opening statement documents that are irrefutable, and demonstrate that the information you will hear is accurate and truthful.Never in a million years did I imagine, when I accepted a job in 2007 to work for Donald Trump, that he would one day run for President, launch acampaign on a platform of hate and intolerance, and actually win. I regret the day I said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way.I am ashamed of my own failings, and I publicly accepted responsibility for them by pleading guilty in the Southern District of New York.I am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty &mdash; of the things I did for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect and promote him.I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump&rsquo;s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience.He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails.<ul><li>A copy of a check Mr. Trump wrote from his personal bank account &mdash; after he became president &ndash; to reimburse me for the hush money payments I made to cover up his affair with an adult film star and prevent damage to his campaign;</li></ul><ul><li>A copy of an article with Mr. Trump&rsquo;s handwriting on it that reported on the auction of a portrait of himself &mdash; he arranged for the bidder ahead of time and then reimbursed the bidder from the account of his non-profit charitable foundation, with the picture now hanging in one of his country clubs; and</li></ul><ul><li>Copies of letters I wrote at Mr. Trump&rsquo;s direction that threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores.</li></ul>I hope my appearance here today, my guilty plea, and my work with law enforcement agencies are steps along a path of redemption that will restore faith in me and help this country understand our president better.</blockquote>\n<p>I have just a few thoughts on this. First and foremost, it is very doubtful that anyone is going to learn anything new about Donald Trump at this media ejaculatorium. Did you think Trump was willing to play fast and loose in his business deals? Did it never occur to you, even once, during the 2016 primary campaign that Trump was running simply to raise his media profile? Were you, at any point, shocked at the thought that Trump might have had one or more mistresses or that he paid them to shut up? Does the idea of Donald Trump using derogatory language toward any race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation leave you gobsmacked? I would say, whether you like him or hate him, that you all answered the questions the same way. None of this is to say this makes his behavior either excusable or worthy of emulation but neither is anything in it so shocking that a Trump voter now would say, &ldquo;if only I&rsquo;d known this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The second point, related to the first, is that just as Cohen characterized Trump as a con man, a cheat, and a racist, Cohen must wear those same labels. He willingly served Trump and was the guy who actually carried out the nefarious deeds he is now blaming Trump for. He was in the room, and silent, when Trump made the alleged racist statements that Cohen has now, conveniently, recalled. Take, for instance, this bit of his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr. Trump.</p><p>Today, I&rsquo;m here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump.</p><p>I lied to Congress about when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016. That was false &mdash; our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign.</p><p>Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That&rsquo;s not how he operates.</p><p>In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there&rsquo;s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie.</p><p>There were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me &ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going in Russia?&rdquo; &mdash; referring to the Moscow Tower project.</p><p>You need to know that Mr. Trump&rsquo;s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it.</p><p>To be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One can&rsquo;t but be struck by a couple of things. Cohen took it upon himself to lie because, he says, that he believed that is what Trump wanted. Why should we think that he&rsquo;s not saying exactly what Elijah Cummings what the New York attorney general&rsquo;s office wants? And Trump&rsquo;s interest in acquiring a property in Russia because he planned on losing the presidential race sort of flies in the face of the collusion narrative.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/elizabeth-vaughn/2020/01/22/white-house-colleague-overheard-eric-ciaramella-alleged-whistleblower-sean-misko-discuss-how-to-remove-trump-from-office/\"><figure><img src=\"https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AdamSchiffAPimage.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Trending</figcaption></figure></a> </p>\n<p>Relatedly, by his own admission, Cohen is a liar. Or, more accurately, his truth is whatever he thinks his audience wants to hear. These are some Cohen tweets before his Fall from Grace.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p>&mdash; aesthetic extremist (@WASPmafia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WASPmafia/status/1100800672952471552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Was he lying then? Or is he lying now? My guess is that Cohen could pass a polygraph today and he could&rsquo;ve passed one when he sent those tweets.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p>It&rsquo;s barely lunch, and Michael Cohen&mdash;who&rsquo;s already going to prison for lying and fraud&mdash;has managed to somehow put himself in even worse legal jeopardy than he was in this morning via his contradictory, false, and self-incriminating testimony today.</p><p>&mdash; Sean Davis (@seanmdav) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/1100807070218141697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Make no mistake about it, Cohen&rsquo;s testimony is just part of a Democrat party to impeach President Trump, an act they can accomplish without a single GOP vote. Don&rsquo;t believe for a second those stories you hear of Pelosi and others saying they don&rsquo;t want impeachment. Of course, they do. Running for re-election with a Senate trial in the near future would be a helluva burden. Even if Pelosi didn&rsquo;t want to impeach, if she wants to keep control of the House she has no choice. The Democrat base demands it and she will do her best to deliver.</p>\n<p><em>I&rsquo;m on Facebook. <a href=\"http://fb.me/streiffredstate\">Drop by and join the fun

The event today and perhaps through the end of the week is his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee where Elijah Cummings is trying to build a case for articles of impeachment to vote on during the upcoming presidential race. This is the prologue, if you will, to Cohen\u2019s prepared statement:\nChairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today.\nI have asked this Committee to ensure that my family be protected from Presidential threats, and that the Committee be sensitive to the questions pertaining to ongoing investigations. Thank you for your help and for your understanding.\nI am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee\u2019s questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump.\nI recognize that some of you may doubt and attack me on my credibility. It is for this reason that I have incorporated into this opening statement documents that are irrefutable, and demonstrate that the information you will hear is accurate and truthful.\nNever in a million years did I imagine, when I accepted a job in 2007 to work for Donald Trump, that he would one day run for President, launch a\ncampaign on a platform of hate and intolerance, and actually win. I regret the day I said \u201cyes\u201d to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way.\nI am ashamed of my own failings, and I publicly accepted responsibility for them by pleading guilty in the Southern District of New York.\nI am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty \u2014 of the things I did for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect and promote him.\nI am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump\u2019s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience.\nHe was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails.\nA copy of a check Mr. Trump wrote from his personal bank account \u2014 after he became president \u2013 to reimburse me for the hush money payments I made to cover up his affair with an adult film star and prevent damage to his campaign;\nA copy of an article with Mr. Trump\u2019s handwriting on it that reported on the auction of a portrait of himself \u2014 he arranged for the bidder ahead of time and then reimbursed the bidder from the account of his non-profit charitable foundation, with the picture now hanging in one of his country clubs; and\nCopies of letters I wrote at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction that threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores.\nI hope my appearance here today, my guilty plea, and my work with law enforcement agencies are steps along a path of redemption that will restore faith in me and help this country understand our president better.\nI have just a few thoughts on this. First and foremost, it is very doubtful that anyone is going to learn anything new about Donald Trump at this media ejaculatorium. Did you think Trump was willing to play fast and loose in his business deals? Did it never occur to you, even once, during the 2016 primary campaign that Trump was running simply to raise his media profile? Were you, at any point, shocked at the thought that Trump might have had one or more mistresses or that he paid them to shut up? Does the idea of Donald Trump using derogatory language toward any race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation leave you gobsmacked? I would say, whether you like him or hate him, that you all answered the questions the same way. None of this is to say this makes his behavior either excusable or worthy of emulation but neither is anything in it so shocking that a Trump voter now would say, \u201cif only I\u2019d known this\u2026\u201d\nThe second point, related to the first, is that just as Cohen characterized Trump as a con man, a cheat, and a racist, Cohen must wear those same labels. He willingly served Trump and was the guy who actually carried out the nefarious deeds he is now blaming Trump for. He was in the room, and silent, when Trump made the alleged racist statements that Cohen has now, conveniently, recalled. Take, for instance, this bit of his testimony:\nThe last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr. Trump.\nToday, I\u2019m here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump.\nI lied to Congress about when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016. That was false \u2014 our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign.\nMr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates.\nIn conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there\u2019s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie.\nThere were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me \u201cHow\u2019s it going in Russia?\u201d \u2014 referring to the Moscow Tower project.\nYou need to know that Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it.\nTo be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.\nOne can\u2019t but be struck by a couple of things. Cohen took it upon himself to lie because, he says, that he believed that is what Trump wanted. Why should we think that he\u2019s not saying exactly what Elijah Cummings what the New York attorney general\u2019s office wants? And Trump\u2019s interest in acquiring a property in Russia because he planned on losing the presidential race sort of flies in the face of the collusion narrative.\nRelatedly, by his own admission, Cohen is a liar. Or, more accurately, his truth is whatever he thinks his audience wants to hear. These are some Cohen tweets before his Fall from Grace.\n\u2014 aesthetic extremist (@WASPmafia) February 27, 2019\nWas he lying then? Or is he lying now? My guess is that Cohen could pass a polygraph today and he could\u2019ve passed one when he sent those tweets.\nIt\u2019s barely lunch, and Michael Cohen\u2014who\u2019s already going to prison for lying and fraud\u2014has managed to somehow put himself in even worse legal jeopardy than he was in this morning via his contradictory, false, and self-incriminating testimony today.\n\u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) February 27, 2019\nMake no mistake about it, Cohen\u2019s testimony is just part of a Democrat party to impeach President Trump, an act they can accomplish without a single GOP vote. Don\u2019t believe for a second those stories you hear of Pelosi and others saying they don\u2019t want impeachment. Of course, they do. Running for re-election with a Senate trial in the near future would be a helluva burden. Even if Pelosi didn\u2019t want to impeach, if she wants to keep control of the House she has no choice. The Democrat base demands it and she will do her best to deliver.\nI\u2019m on Facebook. Drop by and join the fun there.\n=========\n=========",

Just last week, a heavy blow was administered to the egregious practice of civil asset forfeiture in the defense of a <a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/streiff/2019/02/20/supreme-court-blasts-civil-asset-forfeiture-explains-indiana-constitution-applies/\">not-very-bright drug dealer</a>. Likewise the Miranda Rights warning, so beloved of cop shows, were articulated in a decision that let a rapist go free. The requirement that any factors that enhance a sentence must be found by a jury, not by a judge, set aside stiff sentence awarded to a man who <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprendi_v._New_Jersey\">targeted a black family for harassment and intimidation</a>. Another of these cases was heard by the <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/justices-to-weigh-sentencing-rules-for-sex-offenders/\">Supreme Court today</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Andre Haymond was found guilty in 2010 of child pornography charges and sentenced to over three years in prison followed by 10 years of supervised release.</p><p>Two years after he got out of prison, probation officers seized his cellphone and several computers during a surprise search of his apartment. They found several images deemed child pornography and a search history for &ldquo;websites with titles indicative of sexually explicit material,&rdquo; according to court records.</p><p>Haymond was charged with five violations of his supervised release terms.</p><p>The district court sentenced him to five more years in prison and five years of supervised release based on a section of U.S. criminal code that requires a mandatory minimum sentence of five years&rsquo; reincarceration for possession of child pornography.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The issue here is that <a href=\"https://or.fd.org/content/what-difference-between-supervised-release-and-parole\">supervised release is not parole</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Supervised release and parole are similar in many ways. Supervised release and parole are both forms of post-incarceration supervision by the United States Probation Office. The rules and regulations governing supervised releasees and parolees are similar. Violations of either supervised release or parole can result in additional time in custody. Both supervised releasees and parolees are entitled to an attorney when charged with violating the terms of their release. There are, however, important differences between parole and supervised release.</p><p>Persons sentenced in federal court for conduct occurring before November 1, 1987 were sentenced under so-called &ldquo;old law&rdquo; or &ldquo;pre-Guidelines&rdquo; law and are subject to parole. Parole involves release from incarceration before the end of a sentence. Parole is a form of custody served in the community under the supervision of the Probation Office and under the jurisdiction of the United States Parole Commission. Parolees remain in the custody of the Attorney General while on parole. Violations of parole are handled by the Parole Commission. Parolees are not entitled to a hearing before a federal judge.</p><p>Supervised release is an additional term of supervision that must be completed after a person completes his or her term of federal custody. It applies to persons sentenced for offenses committed after November 1, 1987. Such persons are subject to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (also known as &ldquo;new law&rdquo; or &ldquo;Guidelines&rdquo; law) and are not entitled to release parole before the end of a sentence. Persons on supervised release are supervised by the Probation Office, and remain under the jurisdiction of the United States District Court. Violations of supervised release are handled by the District Court, and supervised releasees are entitled to a hearing before the District Court.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And that a judge imposed prison time and an additional period of supervised release without any requirement that the allegations be proven. In fact, the court record shows that the alleged child pornography images were thumbnails that had never been clicked, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3986316-United-States-of-America-v-Andre-Ralph-Haymond.html\">see page 6 of the court record</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/sister-toldjah/2020/02/05/video-watch-kim-guilfoyle-springs-into-action-when-iowa-protester-lunges-donald-trump-jr/\"><figure><img src=\"https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DonTrumpJrKimGuilfoyle.jpg\"></img></figure></a> </p>\n<p>The government, which was defending the statute got rather roughly handled by <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/02/argument-analysis-court-poised-to-rule-for-challenger-in-dispute-over-constitutionality-of-sex-offender-law/#more-283329\">all the justices, save one</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Eric Feigin, an assistant to the U.S. solicitor general, defended the law on behalf of the federal government. But he was quickly interrupted by a skeptical Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who asked him whether there was any other area of the law in which the United States allows a defendant to be sent to prison based on the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.<br>&hellip;<br>Justice Brett Kavanaugh echoed Sotomayor&rsquo;s thinking toward the end of Feigin&rsquo;s initial stint at the lectern. When the government revokes an inmate&rsquo;s parole, Kavanaugh suggested, it is simply denying a benefit. But when the government revokes an individual&rsquo;s supervised release, he continued, that&rsquo;s more like a penalty: The government is &ldquo;adding a chunk of time on.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;<br>Justice Neil Gorsuch was doubtful. Would you still argue that no jury was required, he asked Feigin, if instead of a five-year minimum sentence, an inmate was facing the death penalty? Gorsuch made his feelings even clearer later on, asking Feigin somewhat rhetorically whether the &ldquo;choice of Congress to move away from parole and probation&rdquo; would &ldquo;have no consequences?&rdquo; It &ldquo;would be a rather simple thing to convene a jury,&rdquo; Gorsuch suggested.</p><p>Chief Justice John Roberts was also dubious. The jury&rsquo;s original verdict, he told Feigin, doesn&rsquo;t mean that everything that follows &ndash; including the additional five years in prison for violating the terms of his supervised release &ndash; is &ldquo;necessarily constitutional.&rdquo;</p><p>Justice Elena Kagan piled on, asking, &ldquo;If this isn&rsquo;t a clear-cut violation&rdquo; of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s cases holding that a jury, rather than a judge, must find the facts that increase the penalty for a crime, &ldquo;then what is?&rdquo;</p><p>Only Justice Samuel Alito seemed to be squarely on the government&rsquo;s side, warning that a ruling for Haymond could potentially &ldquo;bring down the entire supervised release system.&rdquo; As a result, much of the second half of the oral argument focused less on whether the law was unconstitutional and more on what should happen next.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Just like the Miranda decision, one doesn&rsquo;t have to have a whit of sympathy for Haymond to see where the prospect of a judge sending someone to prison based on &ldquo;preponderance of evidence.&rdquo; It seems to me that the deprivation of liberty by supervised release is different from being returned to prison and that doing so makes a prisoner&rsquo;s sentence entirely an the whim of a judge. If the federal government doesn&rsquo;t think it can administer this system, then it has the ability to go back to the tried and true parole system that makes it very clear that a parolee is subject to immediate incarceration for any infraction.</p>\n<p><em>I&rsquo;m on Facebook. <a href=\"http://fb.me/streiffredstate\">Drop by and join the fun

                "text": "Often critical safeguards to our civil liberties can come from the the most unusual sources.The Confrontation Clause was defended by helping some very unsavory characters, like a murderer and a small time drug dealer, avoid immediate retribution. Just last week, a heavy blow was administered to the egregious practice of civil asset forfeiture in the defense of a not-very-bright drug dealer. Likewise the Miranda Rights warning, so beloved of cop shows, were articulated in a decision that let a rapist go free. The requirement that any factors that enhance a sentence must be found by a jury, not by a judge, set aside stiff sentence awarded to a man who targeted a black family for harassment and intimidation. Another of these cases was heard by the Supreme Court today.\nAndre Haymond was found guilty in 2010 of child pornography charges and sentenced to over three years in prison followed by 10 years of supervised release.\nTwo years after he got out of prison, probation officers seized his cellphone and several computers during a surprise search of his apartment. They found several images deemed child pornography and a search history for \u201cwebsites with titles indicative of sexually explicit material,\u201d according to court records.\nHaymond was charged with five violations of his supervised release terms.\nThe district court sentenced him to five more years in prison and five years of supervised release based on a section of U.S. criminal code that requires a mandatory minimum sentence of five years\u2019 reincarceration for possession of child pornography.\nThe issue here is that supervised release is not parole.\nSupervised release and parole are similar in many ways. Supervised release and parole are both forms of post-incarceration supervision by the United States Probation Office. The rules and regulations governing supervised releasees and parolees are similar. Violations of either supervised release or parole can result in additional time in custody. Both supervised releasees and parolees are entitled to an attorney when charged with violating the terms of their release. There are, however, important differences between parole and supervised release.\nPersons sentenced in federal court for conduct occurring before November 1, 1987 were sentenced under so-called \u201cold law\u201d or \u201cpre-Guidelines\u201d law and are subject to parole. Parole involves release from incarceration before the end of a sentence. Parole is a form of custody served in the community under the supervision of the Probation Office and under the jurisdiction of the United States Parole Commission. Parolees remain in the custody of the Attorney General while on parole. Violations of parole are handled by the Parole Commission. Parolees are not entitled to a hearing before a federal judge.\nSupervised release is an additional term of supervision that must be completed after a person completes his or her term of federal custody. It applies to persons sentenced for offenses committed after November 1, 1987. Such persons are subject to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (also known as \u201cnew law\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d law) and are not entitled to release parole before the end of a sentence. Persons on supervised release are supervised by the Probation Office, and remain under the jurisdiction of the United States District Court. Violations of supervised release are handled by the District Court, and supervised releasees are entitled to a hearing before the District Court.\nAnd that a judge imposed prison time and an additional period of supervised release without any requirement that the allegations be proven. In fact, the court record shows that the alleged child pornography images were thumbnails that had never been clicked, see page 6 of the court record.\nThe government, which was defending the statute got rather roughly handled by all the justices, save one.\nEric Feigin, an assistant to the U.S. solicitor general, defended the law on behalf of the federal government. But he was quickly interrupted by a skeptical Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who asked him whether there was any other area of the law in which the United States allows a defendant to be sent to prison based on the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.\n\u2026\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh echoed Sotomayor\u2019s thinking toward the end of Feigin\u2019s initial stint at the lectern. When the government revokes an inmate\u2019s parole, Kavanaugh suggested, it is simply denying a benefit. But when the government revokes an individual\u2019s supervised release, he continued, that\u2019s more like a penalty: The government is \u201cadding a chunk of time on.\u201d\n\u2026\nJustice Neil Gorsuch was doubtful. Would you still argue that no jury was required, he asked Feigin, if instead of a five-year minimum sentence, an inmate was facing the death penalty? Gorsuch made his feelings even clearer later on, asking Feigin somewhat rhetorically whether the \u201cchoice of Congress to move away from parole and probation\u201d would \u201chave no consequences?\u201d It \u201cwould be a rather simple thing to convene a jury,\u201d Gorsuch suggested.\nChief Justice John Roberts was also dubious. The jury\u2019s original verdict, he told Feigin, doesn\u2019t mean that everything that follows \u2013 including the additional five years in prison for violating the terms of his supervised release \u2013 is \u201cnecessarily constitutional.\u201d\nJustice Elena Kagan piled on, asking, \u201cIf this isn\u2019t a clear-cut violation\u201d of the Supreme Court\u2019s cases holding that a jury, rather than a judge, must find the facts that increase the penalty for a crime, \u201cthen what is?\u201d\nOnly Justice Samuel Alito seemed to be squarely on the government\u2019s side, warning that a ruling for Haymond could potentially \u201cbring down the entire supervised release system.\u201d As a result, much of the second half of the oral argument focused less on whether the law was unconstitutional and more on what should happen next.\nJust like the Miranda decision, one doesn\u2019t have to have a whit of sympathy for Haymond to see where the prospect of a judge sending someone to prison based on \u201cpreponderance of evidence.\u201d It seems to me that the deprivation of liberty by supervised release is different from being returned to prison and that doing so makes a prisoner\u2019s sentence entirely an the whim of a judge. If the federal government doesn\u2019t think it can administer this system, then it has the ability to go back to the tried and true parole system that makes it very clear that a parolee is subject to immediate incarceration for any infraction.\nI\u2019m on Facebook.

Some meetings date back to 2017, when the administration was first mulling adding the question.</p>\n<p>Industry officials continue to seek assurances from the Census Bureau and the Commerce Department that the question&rsquo;s impact on the quality of Census data will be minimized, according to the sources, who described the meetings on condition of anonymity.</p>\n<p>The pressure reflects the economic importance of the decennial count of America&rsquo;s inhabitants.</p>\n<p>The Census is used to draw voting districts and divide some $800 billion in federal programs. For companies, it provides the most detailed picture available of consumer and labor markets. Under the administration&rsquo;s proposal, the Census would ask whether respondents are citizens of the United States for the first time in 70 years.</p>\n<p>Corporate America finds itself in an unlikely alliance with immigrant advocacy groups that have sued to block the question on the basis it could scare immigrants out of participating, and therefore cost their communities funds and political representation. The Supreme Court plans to hear arguments on the case next week.</p>\n<p>Clothes-maker Levi Strauss &amp; Co, transport companies Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc and media group Univision Communications Inc are among a handful of companies supporting that lawsuit. In court documents, they said the citizenship question &ldquo;threatens to undermine (the) reliability of Census data and therefore substantially reduce its value to businesses.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Few other companies or trade groups, however, have been willing to discuss their opposition to the citizenship question publicly. In interviews, sources said they are only voicing opinions in private meetings, out of concern about a White House backlash.</p>\n<p>Spokespeople for several major trade groups along with big name companies like Walmart Inc, Alphabet Inc&rsquo;s Google, Amazon.com Inc and many others either declined to offer a statement for this story or did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While corporations and business groups are reluctant to enter the political turmoil surrounding the citizenship question on the 2020 Census, they nonetheless depend heavily on accurate Census data for their operations,&rdquo; said DeVere Kutscher, who was until recently executive director of the Census Business Coalition, one of the main groups advocating on behalf of industry.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As a result, they are focusing their efforts on what they can do to support a complete, secure, and accurate count, and are understandably concerned about the impact of any factor which could jeopardize that,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>Underscoring the political stakes, earlier this month President Donald Trump ripped &ldquo;radical&rdquo; Democrats opposed to the citizenship question on Twitter, saying a Census without such a question would be &ldquo;meaningless.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Census Bureau has taken pains to ensure everyone is counted, Burton Reist, a longtime Census official who oversees decennial communications and stakeholder relations, said in an interview. In response to questions about the business community&rsquo;s view on the citizenship question, a spokesman pointed Reuters to the Census Bureau&rsquo;s official responses to stakeholders.</p>\n<p>The Commerce Department, which houses the Census Bureau, provided a statement detailing the planned communications and outreach spending that will encourage people to respond. The budget is $500 million, up from the $376 million spent in 2010.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Census Bureau has long been planning the most robust marketing and outreach effort in Census history for the 2020 Census,&rdquo; a spokesman said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Documents released through litigation confirm that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met with dozens of interested parties, including business groups, to get their views before announcing his decision to add the citizenship question last year.</p>\n<p>While many expressed concerns that the question would hurt response rates, Ross was not convinced, according to a March 2018 memo he wrote explaining his decision. He said data from the question would help the Department of Justice enforce provisions of the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190417&t=2&i=1377904499&r=LYNXNPEF3G0Y3\"></img></figure>\n<p>Slideshow (3 Images)</p>\n<h3>AN &ldquo;MRI&rdquo; FOR BUSINESS </h3>\n<p>The stakes are high in getting an accurate count.</p>\n<p>Retailers like Walmart and Target Corp use Census data to decide where to open stores or distribution hubs, and what to stock on shelves.</p>\n<p>Big banks like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co use the information similarly for branch strategy, and real-estate firms scrutinize the statistics to determine where to build homes and shopping centers.</p>\n<p>TV networks like Univision, meanwhile, rely on the numbers to plan programming in local markets. And the Census is an important input for tech giants like Google when they create myriad data-based products, such as maps.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You get households, number of people, number of bedrooms, income, gender, age, race, marital status &mdash; it&rsquo;s almost like an MRI,&rdquo; said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation. &ldquo;And it all goes into assessing where and how to provide goods and services.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Underscoring how the survey can drive major business decisions, Amazon&rsquo;s 20-city search for a new headquarters location also had Census data at its core.</p>\n<p>Having failed to convince the administration to drop the question, companies are now focused on programs to encourage people to participate in the Census to bolster data quality, sources said.</p>\n<p>Efforts could include company-wide email messages to employees, prominently displaying a link to the Census on corporate web sites or setting up physical stations where customers can fill out the survey inside of stores or malls, the sources said.</p>\n<p>Ahead of the 2010 Census, McDonald&rsquo;s Corp featured information on restaurant placemats, Walmart greeters handed out flyers, big retailers featured reminders on receipts and utility companies stuck inserts into electric, gas and water bills.</p>\n<p>Such programs have been helpful in the past, said John Thompson, who spent nearly 30 years at the Census Bureau before leaving as director in 2017. But whether they can overcome the negative impact of the citizenship question is an open question.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a tougher row to hoe,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; Additional reporting by Nandita Bose in Washington; Kenneth Li, Herb Lash and Caroline Humer in New York; and Katie Paul and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Paul Thomasch</p>",

In interviews, sources said they are only voicing opinions in private meetings, out of concern about a White House backlash.\nSpokespeople for several major trade groups along with big name companies like Walmart Inc, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Amazon.com Inc and many others either declined to offer a statement for this story or did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cWhile corporations and business groups are reluctant to enter the political turmoil surrounding the citizenship question on the 2020 Census, they nonetheless depend heavily on accurate Census data for their operations,\u201d said DeVere Kutscher, who was until recently executive director of the Census Business Coalition, one of the main groups advocating on behalf of industry.\n\u201cAs a result, they are focusing their efforts on what they can do to support a complete, secure, and accurate count, and are understandably concerned about the impact of any factor which could jeopardize that,\u201d he added.\nUnderscoring the political stakes, earlier this month President Donald Trump ripped \u201cradical\u201d Democrats opposed to the citizenship question on Twitter, saying a Census without such a question would be \u201cmeaningless.\u201d\nThe Census Bureau has taken pains to ensure everyone is counted, Burton Reist, a longtime Census official who oversees decennial communications and stakeholder relations, said in an interview. In response to questions about the business community\u2019s view on the citizenship question, a spokesman pointed Reuters to the Census Bureau\u2019s official responses to stakeholders.\nThe Commerce Department, which houses the Census Bureau, provided a statement detailing the planned communications and outreach spending that will encourage people to respond. The budget is $500 million, up from the $376 million spent in 2010.\n\u201cThe Census Bureau has long been planning the most robust marketing and outreach effort in Census history for the 2020 Census,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement.\nDocuments released through litigation confirm that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met with dozens of interested parties, including business groups, to get their views before announcing his decision to add the citizenship question last year.\nWhile many expressed concerns that the question would hurt response rates, Ross was not convinced, according to a March 2018 memo he wrote explaining his decision. He said data from the question would help the Department of Justice enforce provisions of the Voting Rights Act.\nSlideshow (3 Images)\nAN \u201cMRI\u201d FOR BUSINESS\nThe stakes are high in getting an accurate count.\nRetailers like Walmart and Target Corp use Census data to decide where to open stores or distribution hubs, and what to stock on shelves.\nBig banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co use the information similarly for branch strategy, and real-estate firms scrutinize the statistics to determine where to build homes and shopping centers.\nTV networks like Univision, meanwhile, rely on the numbers to plan programming in local markets. And the Census is an important input for tech giants like Google when they create myriad data-based products, such as maps.\n\u201cYou get households, number of people, number of bedrooms, income, gender, age, race, marital status \u2014 it\u2019s almost like an MRI,\u201d said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation. \u201cAnd it all goes into assessing where and how to provide goods and services.\u201d\nUnderscoring how the survey can drive major business decisions, Amazon\u2019s 20-city search for a new headquarters location also had Census data at its core.\nHaving failed to convince the administration to drop the question, companies are now focused on programs to encourage people to participate in the Census to bolster data quality, sources said.\nEfforts could include company-wide email messages to employees, prominently displaying a link to the Census on corporate web sites or setting up physical stations where customers can fill out the survey inside of stores or malls, the sources said.\nAhead of the 2010 Census, McDonald\u2019s Corp featured information on restaurant placemats, Walmart greeters handed out flyers, big retailers featured reminders on receipts and utility companies stuck inserts into electric, gas and water bills.\nSuch programs have been helpful in the past, said John Thompson, who spent nearly 30 years at the Census Bureau before leaving as director in 2017. But whether they can overcome the negative impact of the citizenship question is an open question.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a tougher row to hoe,\u201d he said.\nReporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; Additional reporting by Nandita Bose in Washington; Kenneth Li, Herb Lash and Caroline Humer in New York; and Katie Paul and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Paul Thomasch",

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The court ruled 5-4 along ideological lines, with its conservative justices in the majority and its liberal justices dissenting, that federal authorities could place such immigrants into indefinite detention anytime without the possibility of bail, not just immediately after they finish prison sentences.</p>\n<p>The ruling, authored by conservative Justice Samuel Alito, left open the possibility that some immigrants could challenge their detention. These immigrants potentially could argue that the use of the 1996 federal law involved in the case, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, against them long after finishing their sentences would violate their due process rights under the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n<p>Most of the plaintiffs in the case are legal immigrants.</p>\n<p>The law states the government can detain convicted immigrants &ldquo;when the alien is released&rdquo; from criminal detention. Civil rights lawyers in the case argued that the language of the law shows that it applies only immediately after immigrants are released. The Trump administration said the government should have the power to detain such immigrants anytime.</p>\n<p>In dissent, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said the ruling raises serious due process questions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It runs the gravest risk of depriving those whom the government has detained of one of the oldest and most important of our constitutionally guaranteed freedoms,&rdquo; Breyer wrote.</p>\n<p>But Alito wrote that it is not the court&rsquo;s job to impose a time limit for when immigrants can be detained after serving a prison sentence. Alito noted that the court has previously said that &ldquo;an official&rsquo;s crucial duties are better carried out late than never.&rdquo; Alito said the challengers&rsquo; assertion that immigrants had to be detained within 24 hours of ending a prison sentence is &ldquo;especially hard to swallow.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It marked Trump&rsquo;s latest immigration victory at the court. The conservative justices also were in the majority in June 2018 when the court upheld on a 5-4 vote Trump&rsquo;s travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries.</p>\n<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s decision follows a February 2018 ruling in a similar case in which the conservative majority, over liberal dissent, curbed the ability of immigrants held in long-term detention during deportation proceedings to argue for release.</p>\n<h3>&lsquo;MOST EXTREME INTERPRETATION&rsquo; </h3>\n<p>American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Cecilia Wang, who argued the newly decided case for the challengers, said that in both rulings &ldquo;the Supreme Court has endorsed the most extreme interpretation of immigration detention statutes, allowing mass incarceration of people without any hearing, simply because they are defending themselves against a deportation charge.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Wang said the ACLU is &ldquo;looking into follow-up litigation along various avenues.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump has backed limits on legal and illegal immigrants since taking office in January 2017.</p>\n<p>Kerri Kupec, a U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman, said administration officials were pleased with the ruling.</p>\n<p>The case&rsquo;s plaintiffs included two legal U.S. residents involved in separate lawsuits filed in 2013, a Cambodian immigrant named Mony Preap convicted of marijuana possession and a Palestinian immigrant named Bassam Yusuf Khoury convicted of attempting to manufacture a controlled substance.</p>\n<p>In the two detention case rulings, the Supreme Court reversed the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a liberal leaning court with jurisdiction over a large part of the western United States that Trump has frequently criticized. In both cases, litigation against the federal government started before Trump took office.</p>\n<p>In the latest case, the administration had appealed a 2016 9th Circuit ruling that favored immigrants, a decision it said would undermine the government&rsquo;s ability to deport immigrants who have committed crimes.</p>\n<p>The 9th Circuit had ruled that convicted immigrants who are not immediately detained by immigration authorities after finishing their sentences but then later picked up by immigration authorities could seek bond hearings to argue for their release.</p>\n<p>Other regional federal appeals courts that have addressed the issue did not rule the same way as the 9th Circuit and were more in line with the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling. That means immigrants in those regions who were subject to mandatory detention already were not entitled to bond hearings.</p>\n<p>Under federal immigration law, immigrants convicted of certain offenses are subject to mandatory detention during their deportation process. They can be held indefinitely without a bond hearing after completing their sentences.</p>\n<p>In April 2018, conservative Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch joined the court&rsquo;s four liberals in a 5-4 ruling that could hinder the administration&rsquo;s ability to step up the removal of immigrants with criminal records, invalidating a provision in another law, the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>",

The conservative justices also were in the majority in June 2018 when the court upheld on a 5-4 vote Trump\u2019s travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries.\nTuesday\u2019s decision follows a February 2018 ruling in a similar case in which the conservative majority, over liberal dissent, curbed the ability of immigrants held in long-term detention during deportation proceedings to argue for release.\n\u2018MOST EXTREME INTERPRETATION\u2019\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union lawyer Cecilia Wang, who argued the newly decided case for the challengers, said that in both rulings \u201cthe Supreme Court has endorsed the most extreme interpretation of immigration detention statutes, allowing mass incarceration of people without any hearing, simply because they are defending themselves against a deportation charge.\u201d\nWang said the ACLU is \u201clooking into follow-up litigation along various avenues.\u201d\nTrump has backed limits on legal and illegal immigrants since taking office in January 2017.\nKerri Kupec, a U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman, said administration officials were pleased with the ruling.\nThe case\u2019s plaintiffs included two legal U.S. residents involved in separate lawsuits filed in 2013, a Cambodian immigrant named Mony Preap convicted of marijuana possession and a Palestinian immigrant named Bassam Yusuf Khoury convicted of attempting to manufacture a controlled substance.\nIn the two detention case rulings, the Supreme Court reversed the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a liberal leaning court with jurisdiction over a large part of the western United States that Trump has frequently criticized. In both cases, litigation against the federal government started before Trump took office.\nIn the latest case, the administration had appealed a 2016 9th Circuit ruling that favored immigrants, a decision it said would undermine the government\u2019s ability to deport immigrants who have committed crimes.\nThe 9th Circuit had ruled that convicted immigrants who are not immediately detained by immigration authorities after finishing their sentences but then later picked up by immigration authorities could seek bond hearings to argue for their release.\nOther regional federal appeals courts that have addressed the issue did not rule the same way as the 9th Circuit and were more in line with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. That means immigrants in those regions who were subject to mandatory detention already were not entitled to bond hearings.\nUnder federal immigration law, immigrants convicted of certain offenses are subject to mandatory detention during their deportation process. They can be held indefinitely without a bond hearing after completing their sentences.\nIn April 2018, conservative Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch joined the court\u2019s four liberals in a 5-4 ruling that could hinder the administration\u2019s ability to step up the removal of immigrants with criminal records, invalidating a provision in another law, the Immigration and Nationality Act.",

REUTERS/Jim Young\nThe newly released documents showed how the FBI made extensive use of its access to Cohen\u2019s Apple iCloud account, which allowed him to coordinate his work across such devices as an iPhone, iPad Mini and laptop.\nFBI agents said they located a hotel room in New York\u2019s Loews Regency Hotel where Cohen was staying by using a device known as a Triggerfish that mimics cell phone towers to find a specific device.\nThe bank fraud case stemmed from Cohen dealings unrelated to Trump, and suggest that his financial situation was dire.\nAccording to the documents, Cohen was in default by December 2017 on more than $20 million in loans backed by New York taxicab medallions he owned.\nThe FBI believed Cohen misrepresented his finances to banks he owed money to.\nAccording to the documents, Cohen concealed fees being paid to Essential Consultants, a firm he controlled, for political consulting, including from international clients with issues pending before the Trump administration.\nAmong the payments Cohen was believed to have received was $600,000 from AT&T Inc for consulting about \u201cpolitical issues, including net neutrality, the merger between AT&T and Time Warner and tax reform.\u201d\nAnother $583,333 came from an investment firm controlled by Russian businessman Viktor Vekselberg, the documents showed.\nRepublicans in Congress have criticized Cohen\u2019s consulting work, arguing he should have made his contracts public through disclosures. The warrant does not appear to detail any violations to lobbying disclosure laws.\nCohen also used Essential Consultants to pay hush money to Daniels.",

He is lying in order to reduce his prison time,&rdquo; Trump wrote on Twitter from Vietnam, where he was meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>\n<p>Republican lawmakers at the hearing tried to undermine Cohen, portraying him as an irredeemable liar who had benefited from financial crimes he pleaded guilty to last year, and saying the hearing was an opening gambit in a Democratic push to impeach Trump.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Michael Cohen is capable of telling the truth,&rdquo; said Republican Representative James Comer.</p>\n<p>Cohen was mostly calm and contrite under the heated questioning from Republicans, and cautioned them not to make the same mistake he did in protecting Trump.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190227&t=2&i=1361130213&r=LYNXNPEF1Q1ZA\"></img></figure>\n<p>Former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen reacts emotionally to the concluding statement of committee Chairman Rep Elijah Cummings (D-MD) at the conclusion of Cohen's testimony at a House Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 27, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I did the same thing as you&rsquo;re doing now, for 10 years. I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years,&rdquo; Cohen told the committee hearing. &ldquo;The more people that follow Mr. Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I am suffering.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>ALLY TURNED WITNESS </h3>\n<p>Cohen was one of Trump&rsquo;s closest aides and fiercest defenders, working with him on business and personal deals for a decade.</p>\n<p>But he turned against him last year and is cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty to tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. Democrats took control of the House after last year&rsquo;s midterm elections and called Cohen to testify.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat,&rdquo; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>He said he was directed by Trump in 2016 to make a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover up an extra-marital affair.</p>\n<p>That payment could amount to an illegal in-kind contribution by Cohen to the campaign because it exceeded donation limits and was not disclosed in Trump&rsquo;s campaign finance reports, legal experts say.</p>\n<p>Trump has denied having sex with Daniels and said the payments to her and another woman who claimed an affair were not illegal.</p>\n<p>Cohen turned over to the committee a copy of a $35,000 check Trump signed on Aug. 1, 2017, one in a series he said was to reimburse him for paying off Daniels after Trump took office.</p>\n<p>Cohen said Trump&rsquo;s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., co-signed another check, again for $35,000. A lawyer for Donald Jr. did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190227&t=2&i=1361129924&r=LYNXNPEF1Q1ZJ\"></img></figure>\n<p>Slideshow (22 Images)</p>\n<p>The sweeping claims against Trump, from a man who once said he would take a bullet for his boss, come as Mueller appears to be close to completing his investigation into possible collusion between Trump&rsquo;s campaign and Russian efforts to sway the vote.</p>\n<p>Trump has called the Mueller investigation a &ldquo;witch hunt.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>U.S. officials have said the emails released by WikiLeaks were stolen by Russia as part of Moscow&rsquo;s campaign of hacking and propaganda during the presidential race aimed at sowing discord in the United States and harming Clinton.</p>\n<p>Trump has previously denied knowing in advance about the release of hacked Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails during the election.</p>\n<p>Cohen said he was in Trump&rsquo;s office in July 2016 when Roger Stone, a self-described &ldquo;dirty trickster&rdquo; and longtime political adviser to Trump, called the then Republican presidential candidate.</p>\n<p>Cohen said Stone told Trump he had been speaking with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who told him there would be a dump of emails within a couple of days that would damage Clinton&rsquo;s campaign.</p>\n<p>The DNC emails drove a wedge between supporters of Clinton and her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders. Although Clinton won the nomination, that rift weakened her candidacy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s statement is untrue,&rdquo; Stone said in an email, but did not specify which parts of the statement he meant.</p>\n<p>Stone was indicted by Mueller on charges of lying to Congress about his communications with others related to WikiLeaks email dumps.</p>\n<p>Cohen apologized for initially lying to Congress in 2017, when he said efforts to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow had ceased by January 2016. He now says they continued through June 2016, during the height of the election campaign, and that Trump&rsquo;s lawyers &ldquo;reviewed and edited&rdquo; those false statements to Congress.</p>\n<p>Cohen said Trump on multiple occasions inquired about the Moscow real estate project while telling the public he had no business dealings in Russia.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars,&rdquo; Cohen said.</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen accused him of breaking the law while in office and said for the first time that Trump knew in advance about a WikiLeaks dump of stolen emails that hurt his 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton.\nIn a dramatic televised hearing in Congress on Wednesday, Cohen said Trump approved hush payments to cover up extra-marital sexual relationships in violation of campaign finance laws, and signed a personal check for $35,000 in 2017 to reimburse Cohen for at least one of those payments.\nCohen, 52, was a close aide of Trump for years and his testimony could increase the legal and political pressure on the Republican president, but he did not appear to reveal a \u201csmoking gun\u201d that would sink his former boss.\nCohen told a House of Representatives committee he had no direct evidence that Trump or his campaign colluded with Moscow during the election campaign.\nPossible collusion is a key theme of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, which has dogged the president during his two years in office Trump has repeatedly denied the allegation as has the Kremlin.\nAssailing the president as a \u201cconman\u201d and a \u201ccheat\u201d, Cohen said Trump knew ahead of time about WikiLeaks\u2019 release of emails in 2016 that undermined Democrat Clinton\u2019s presidential bid.\nHe also said Trump directed negotiations for a real estate project in Moscow during the White House race even as he publicly said he had no business interests in Russia.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word colluding,\u201d Cohen said of Trump\u2019s dealings with Russia, adding that there was \u201csomething odd\u201d about the president\u2019s good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nThe White House had no comment on Cohen\u2019s testimony but Trump earlier on Wednesday accused his former employee of lying.\n\u201cHe did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter from Vietnam, where he was meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nRepublican lawmakers at the hearing tried to undermine Cohen, portraying him as an irredeemable liar who had benefited from financial crimes he pleaded guilty to last year, and saying the hearing was an opening gambit in a Democratic push to impeach Trump.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe Michael Cohen is capable of telling the truth,\u201d said Republican Representative James Comer.\nCohen was mostly calm and contrite under the heated questioning from Republicans, and cautioned them not to make the same mistake he did in protecting Trump.\nFormer Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen reacts emotionally to the concluding statement of committee Chairman Rep Elijah Cummings (D-MD) at the conclusion of Cohen's testimony at a House Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 27, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\u201cI did the same thing as you\u2019re doing now, for 10 years. I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years,\u201d Cohen told the committee hearing. \u201cThe more people that follow Mr. Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I am suffering.\u201d\nALLY TURNED WITNESS\nCohen was one of Trump\u2019s closest aides and fiercest defenders, working with him on business and personal deals for a decade.\nBut he turned against him last year and is cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty to tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. Democrats took control of the House after last year\u2019s midterm elections and called Cohen to testify.\n\u201cI am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat,\u201d Cohen said.\nHe said he was directed by Trump in 2016 to make a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover up an extra-marital affair.\nThat payment could amount to an illegal in-kind contribution by Cohen to the campaign because it exceeded donation limits and was not disclosed in Trump\u2019s campaign finance reports, legal experts say.\nTrump has denied having sex with Daniels and said the payments to her and another woman who claimed an affair were not illegal.\nCohen turned over to the committee a copy of a $35,000 check Trump signed on Aug. 1, 2017, one in a series he said was to reimburse him for paying off Daniels after Trump took office.\nCohen said Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., co-signed another check, again for $35,000. A lawyer for Donald Jr. did not respond to a request for comment.\nSlideshow (22 Images)\nThe sweeping claims against Trump, from a man who once said he would take a bullet for his boss, come as Mueller appears to be close to completing his investigation into possible collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian efforts to sway the vote.\nTrump has called the Mueller investigation a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\nU.S. officials have said the emails released by WikiLeaks were stolen by Russia as part of Moscow\u2019s campaign of hacking and propaganda during the presidential race aimed at sowing discord in the United States and harming Clinton.\nTrump has previously denied knowing in advance about the release of hacked Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails during the election.\nCohen said he was in Trump\u2019s office in July 2016 when Roger Stone, a self-described \u201cdirty trickster\u201d and longtime political adviser to Trump, called the then Republican presidential candidate.\nCohen said Stone told Trump he had been speaking with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who told him there would be a dump of emails within a couple of days that would damage Clinton\u2019s campaign.\nThe DNC emails drove a wedge between supporters of Clinton and her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders. Although Clinton won the nomination, that rift weakened her candidacy.\n\u201cMr. Cohen\u2019s statement is untrue,\u201d Stone said in an email, but did not specify which parts of the statement he meant.\nStone was indicted by Mueller on charges of lying to Congress about his communications with others related to WikiLeaks email dumps.\nCohen apologized for initially lying to Congress in 2017, when he said efforts to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow had ceased by January 2016. He now says they continued through June 2016, during the height of the election campaign, and that Trump\u2019s lawyers \u201creviewed and edited\u201d those false statements to Congress.\nCohen said Trump on multiple occasions inquired about the Moscow real estate project while telling the public he had no business dealings in Russia.\n\u201cHe lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Cohen said.",
