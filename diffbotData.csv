US disrupted alleged Russian trolls' internet access during midterms: Report,Lee Ferran,"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 14:40:00 GMT",N/A,"U.S. cyber operators disrupted internet access for purported Russian trolls on the day of the 2018 midterm elections in a bid to hamper their propaganda operations, according to a report by The Washington Post.
The operation by U.S. Cyber Command reportedly targeted the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency (IRA), which U.S. officials and prosecutors from Robert Mueller’s special counsel team allege operated an expansive influence operation designed in part to undermine American democracy by sowing discord online ahead of the 2016 presidential election and 2018 midterm elections.
“They basically took the IRA offline,” an individual familiar with the operation told the Post. “They shut ‘em down.”
The head of U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency (NSA), Gen. Paul Nakasone, previously indicated his cyber warriors would be more aggressive in countering America’s adversaries across borders in cyberspace. Ahead of the midterms, the U.S. set up the “Russia Small Group,” a joint Cyber Command-NSA task force, specifically to “assist in the securing of the 2018 midterm elections,” he said.
“Acting includes defending forward,” he said in an interview with the military journal Joint Force Quarterly (JFQ). “How do we warn, how do we influence our adversaries, how do we position ourselves in case we have to achieve outcomes in the future? Acting is the concept of operating outside our borders, being outside our networks, to ensure that we understand what our adversaries are doing.”
The New York Times previously reported that Cyber Command officials had taken to warning individual alleged Russian operatives suspected of spreading disinformation online that they should not mess with the midterms.
Representatives for the NSA and Cyber Command did not immediately return ABC News’ requests for comment.
It remains to be seen what kind of impact the reported internet disruption may have had, according to experts.
Bret Schafer, a social media analyst at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, told ABC News that his organization didn’t notice a dramatic drop off of online propaganda on the day of the midterms, but he noted that his organization wasn’t focused solely on purported IRA accounts. He also pointed out that by then social media giants Twitter and Facebook already had taken down hundreds of accounts suspected to be linked to the IRA and other nefarious actors.
After conducting a review of foreign interference attempts during the midterms, the U.S. intelligence community released a report concluding that while there was no evidence that votes or vote tallies were altered, online influence operations emanating from Russia and other nations persisted similar to the weeks leading up to voting.
Jake Williams, a former Defense Department cyber operations official, told ABC News, “I don’t doubt they caused disruptions, I’m only dubious about how much... [But] it’s important to remember that this is a disruption operation, so any level of disruption is considered a success. It’s not necessary to take the target completely offline to be ‘successful.’”
Williams said that a potential problem with such operations is that American cyber operators can likely only use whatever secret tactics they used once.
“Unlike a missile that you test and say ‘if you oppose us, you’ve got one of these coming,’ cyber weapons are easy to defend against once you know what’s happening,” he said.
In his interview with JFQ, Nakasone suggested that U.S. Cyber Command was no longer interested in holding its cyber tools in reserve.
“Unlike the nuclear realm, where our strategic advantage or power comes from possessing a capability or weapons system, in cyberspace it’s the use of cyber capabilities that is strategically consequential,” he said. “The threat of using something in cyberspace is not as powerful as actually using it because that’s what our adversaries are doing to us.”"
Appeals court says special counsel Robert Mueller 'properly appointed'; orders ex-Stone aide to testify,Ali Dukakis,"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 09:05:00 GMT",N/A,"A federal appeals court rejected the most direct constitutional challenge to special counsel Robert Mueller’s authority on Tuesday, telling a former associate of Roger Stone he must testify before Mueller because the special counsel was ""properly appointed"" to his role overseeing the independent investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The appeal was launched on behalf of Andrew Miller, a former associate of Stone, a political provocateur, and steered by the National Legal and Policy Center, a well-funded conservative legal group with a deep history of mounting legal challenges against left-leaning organizations and Democratic politicians.
Miller is fighting a special counsel subpoena compelling him to appear before Mueller's federal grand jury, which has been met with heavy legal resistance. In late June, Miller turned over requested documents to prosecutors, but he was also subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury in the Russia probe.
The three judge panel found that Mueller was properly appointed in the spring of 2017 by the then-deputy attorney general of the United States, Rod Rosenstein, after the attorney general at the time Jeff Sessions, recused himself from the Russia investigation.
“Because the Special Counsel is an inferior officer, and the Deputy Attorney General became the head of the Department by virtue of becoming the Acting Attorney General as a result of a vacancy created by the disability of the Attorney General through recusal on the matter, we hold that Miller’s challenge to the appointment of the Special Counsel fails. Accordingly, we affirm the order finding Miller in civil contempt,” D.C. Circuit Court Judges Karen Henderson, Sri Srinivasan and Judith Rogers wrote in an opinion Tuesday.
In upholding the contempt order, the three-judge panel ordered Miller to testify before Mueller's grand jury.
After oral arguments last November, Miller's attorney Paul Kamenar told ABC News, ""Even if we lose this [appeals] case we will certainly bring it to the Supreme Court.""
Kamenar’s challenge to the legitimacy of the special counsel probe is based on a claim that Mueller’s appointment was not handled properly. He argues Mueller has been effectively operating as a “U.S. Attorney at large,” and as such, should have been appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate – neither of which occurred.
In a statement to ABC News following the judges’ decision to uphold the contempt order against Miller, Kamenar wrote, ""We are disappointed with the decision and will be considering future legal action, whether before the full court of appeals or the Supreme Court.”
Kamenar added, “The fact that the court took over three months to decide this appeal after oral argument compared to the three days it took in December to decide another challenge to a Mueller subpoena issued to an unnamed foreign corporation, demonstrates that this was a serious and substantial challenge.”
Reached by ABC News on Tuesday, special counsel spokesperson Peter Carr declined to comment.
Miller, 34, paints houses for a living now but served as an aide to Stone until 2013.
Stone, who was a longtime informal political adviser to President Donald Trump, once described Miller as his “wingman” because he helped manage Stone’s schedule, travel and media appearances, and also provided “some I.T. work.” Miller identifies himself as a libertarian and has said he did not support Trump’s candidacy, but he did accompany Stone to the 2016 Republican National Convention.
On Jan. 25th, Stone was arrested in a pre-dawn FBI raid at his home in Florida and charged with a seven-count indictment in Mueller's probe. On Feb. 1, he pleaded not guilty to the charges."
The Electoral College limits the campaign playing field. Popular voting expands it: ANALYSIS,Matthew Dowd,"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 21:39:00 GMT",N/A,"U.S Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is competing for the Democratic nomination for president, said this week that she supports “getting rid of the electoral college,” and having the presidency decided by a national popular vote.
She was quickly attacked by many who think this is a “radical idea.” Let us pause for a moment and examine that hypothesis.
First, in polling over the last few years, a large majority of voters support deciding the presidency by popular vote as opposed to the Electoral College. Support for the popular vote has risen as Americans have witnessed, in the last 20 years, two presidents win the Oval Office while losing the national popular vote. The difference in 2016 was greatest -- Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 3 million, but lost the Electoral College to Donald Trump.
Second, the argument that the Electoral College ensures that candidates travel to smaller states as well as large ones isn’t true, and is no longer happening. In the 2020 elections, campaigns and candidates from both major parties are expected to concentrate nearly all their time and efforts in only 5 or 6 states, which represent less than 20 percent of people who will vote for president. Therefore, 44 or 45 states, large and small, will be virtually ignored in the process as it is now.
If the 2020 election were to be decided by a national popular vote instead of the Electoral College, candidates and campaigns in the general election would have to completely refashion their strategies.
In all likelihood, they would have to run a national campaign with national advertising buys where all Americans would be involved in the debate over who the next president should be. To reallocate resources, the campaigns would have to put time and effort into at least 40 states, representing 90 percent of the country’s voters.
In a national popular vote effort, campaigns would have to spend time in places like Texas, California, New York, Louisiana, Washington, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, George, North Carolina, etc. Under the current system, candidates only go to those states to fundraise.
A popular vote effort would have to appeal to voters in urban, suburban, ex-urban, and rural communities of America. And campaigns would have to concentrate on both turning out their bases, as well as persuading swing voters.
If you are someone who is an independent and wants choices in the presidential race other than Democrat or Republican, ending the Electoral College removes a major impediment for an independent presidential candidacy. It is much easier for an independent to win the popular vote than it is for that candidate to win the Electoral College.
Third, while passing a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College is highly unlikely -- the bar of three-fourths of states passing an amendment in this polarized environment is almost impossible -- there are constitutional ways to make the presidential election more representative of the nation as a whole, involving more voters from more areas. Already, a number of states have signed on to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, in which a state’s electoral votes would be assigned to whoever won the national popular vote. Though they are not yet at the required number of states necessary to total 270 electoral votes, there is a path to get their politically in the years ahead.
Another way to make the popular vote matter, while retaining the Electoral College, is to adopt the Maine and Nebraska model. Those states assign electoral votes by a combination of two statewide and one for each congressional district in their states. A presidential candidate wins one electoral vote for every house district they win. This would need to be combined with efforts to fix gerrymandering and expanding their number of members in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Today, each House member represents on average about 750,000 people which has become both unwieldy and less responsive to constituents. Keep in mind, in 1789 after the first apportionment, 105 House members each represented roughly 37,000 people, according to the Pew Research Center. The number of representatives has increased after nearly every census apportionment until it reached 435 members in 1913, when the average district size was at approximately 200,000 people. A law was passed in 1911 limiting the size of the House to 435 members, and it has remained for more than 100 years. Our founders foresaw a rise in House members as America grew in population, and Congress could pass a law to expand the House to a more representative number.
So while abolishing the Electoral College as Warren suggests may be near impossible, her statement that a president should be elected by national popular vote is not radical, it is actually mainstream.
We can get closer to the national popular vote having greater weight in presidential elections and having a president represent all Americans in ways that don’t require amending the Constitution. These fixes will make presidential candidates run more diverse campaigns, and campaign in all cities and communities of our country.
That will help unify us more as a country, and would likely lead to more informed public policy. How can anyone be against that outcome?"
"Facebook agrees to hide demographics from landlords, creditors looking to advertise",Anne Flaherty,"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 13:38:00 GMT",N/A,"Facebook announced Tuesday that it will block landlords and creditors from using a person's demographic data including a person’s zip code, gender and age, to target certain groups in online advertisements.
The announcement is part of a legal settlement with groups that promote fair housing laws. They complained in court last year that the social media giant enabled real estate brokers and landlords to exclude certain demographics when advertising.
The federal government, under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, had filed its own complaint against Facebook for violating the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits businesses from which prohibits the sale or rental of housing based on such factors as race or religion.
The company also was accused of allowing employers to discriminate against women by targeting job listings toward men only, specifically in traditionally male-dominated fields.
The complaints followed a 2016 report by ProPublica that found Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude anyone with an “affinity” for African-American, Asian-American or Hispanic people.
The 1968 Fair Housing Act of 1968 says its illegal ""to make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.”
Facebook said in a blog post Tuesday by Sheryl Sandberg, the company's chief operating officer, that it already prohibited certain categories from being used in advertising such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and religion. The company said it removed the option for landlords, employers and creditors to reach people with an ""affinity for African-American or Hispanic-related content"" about a year ago.
Under the new rules, a company looking to run housing, employment or credit ads also won’t be able to target Facebook members based on age, gender or zip code. And, Facebook said it was also building a tool that would let people search for all housing ads in the U.S. regardless of whether the ads are shown.
“Housing, employment and credit ads are crucial to helping people buy new homes, start great careers, and gain access to credit,” Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote in the company’s online post. “They should never be used to exclude or harm people.”
A joint statement by the advocacy groups, including the National Fair Housing Alliance, said in a statement that the agreement represented a ""significant and historic precedent for big data and tech companies"" because it makes clear the information they collect can't be used to discriminate.
""Companies must understand that depending on how data is being used, it can harm people and communities,"" said Fred Freiberg, director of the Fair Housing Justice Center of New York. ""This agreement will help other companies that rely on algorithms and data for a range of services and operations to carefully consider whether their policies, products, and platforms are illegally discriminating against consumers."""
"Donald Trump and 'the Trump of the Tropics,' Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, meet at White House",Meridith McGraw,"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 12:44:00 GMT",N/A,"President Donald Trump and ""the Trump of the Tropics,"" Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, met face to face at the White House on Tuesday.
Bolsonaro -- a nationalist, Twitter-loving, ""fake-news"" decrying politician -- chose to make the first bilateral trip of his presidency to Washington, where he has found an important friend and ally in Trump.
As part of a three-day visit in Washington, Bolsonaro held a press conference with Trump as he aims to strengthen economic ties and positioning with the U.S. as Brazil seeks an allied front in the Western Hemisphere. In a statement ahead of the visit, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the two leaders will discuss ""opportunities for defense cooperation, pro-growth trade policies, combating transnational crime and restoring democracy in Venezuela.""
A senior administration official, who requested anonymity, told reporters Bolsonaro's visit represented a ""real opportunity to fundamentally remake our relationship with Brazil.""
""The U.S.-Brazil relationship has always been one of potential, but yet that potential has not always been met,"" the senior administration official said. ""This time it is different. This is a historic remaking of the U.S.-Brazil relationship where there is truly going to be a North-South axis of the two largest economies in the Western Hemisphere and a true partnership of the largest economies.""
At the start of their White House meetings, the president said he is considering NATO membership or some kind of similar alliance for Brazil.
“We are looking at it very strongly. We are very inclined to do that. The relationship that we have right now with Brazil has never been better. I think there was a lot of hostility with other presidents. There is zero hostility with me,” Trump said. “And we are going to look at that very strongly in terms of whether it is NATO or something having to do with alliance.”
In the Rose Garden press conference, the two leaders said they were able to discuss their goals in Venezuela. Trump threatened tougher sanctions on Venezuela and said ""all options are on the table."" Maduro would not divulge any new strategies in the region, but said establishing a true democracy in the country was a shared priority.
The leaders on Tuesday also discussed a Brazilian offer to grant the United States access to a rocket launch site, the removal of a Visa requirement for Americans traveling to Brazil, and trade.
If Bolsonaro's goal was to strengthen the relationship between Brazil and the United States, it appeared he was successful at least in gaining the friendship of Trump, who gave him a warm welcome in the Rose Garden. Bolsonaro even got a chuckle out of the president for saying he believed he would get re-elected.
""Well, it's an internal affair. We will respect whatever the ballots tell us on 2020, but I do believe Donald Trump is going to be re-elected fully,"" Bolsonaro said when asked about the 2020 elections.
""Thank you. I agree,"" Trump said with a smile.
Trump said he liked to hear Bolsonaro use the term ""fake news.""
In his opening statement, Bolsonaro said that Brazil and the United States ""stand side by side in their efforts to ensure liberties in respect to traditional family lifestyles, respect to god, our creator, politically correct attitudes, and against fake news.""
Trump said he was ""proud"" to hear his new Brazilian buddy use the same term.
Bolsonaro, who was accompanied on his trip to the United States by his son, lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, visited CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Monday and addressed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Brazil is the second-largest economy in the Western Hemisphere, and the United States is Brazil's second-largest trading partner after China.
""For the first time in a while, a pro-America Brazilian president arrives in D.C.,"" Bolsonaro tweeted upon arriving in Washington. ""It's the beginning of a partnership focused on liberty and prosperity, something that all of us Brazilians have long wished for.""
Like Trump, Bolsonaro is a right-wing populist with a penchant for rocking the status quo and using Twitter to blast his message around the globe. Bolsonaro has been accused of making racist and homophobic remarks and recently has come under fire for a sexually explicit tweet during Brazil’s Carnival festival.
Trump was one of the first world leaders to call and congratulate Bolsonaro after this landslide victory in October. Similar to Trump's election, Bolsonaro's win stunned the world and was part a wave of nationalist, right-wing leaders elected in Latin America.
""His election, he broke all of the historic taboos of winning an election in Latin America. He was unabashedly, particularly in Brazil, pro America,"" a senior administration official said of Bolsonaro. ""He ran on a campaign that he wanted to be the best friend of the United States that he wanted to have this close relationship with President Trump, and what that would mean for Brazil, for the region, for the world, I think that was very important.""
The official said the president took note of Bolsonaro's Trump-like rhetoric and social media presence, and called Bolsonaro to congratulate him within hours of his election.
U.S. officials hope the visit will not only boost their economic relationship but align efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to Venezuela.
Brazil shares a border with Venezuela and, like the United States, has joined with dozens of other world leaders in pressuring socialist Nicholas Maduro to turn over power to opposition leader Juan Guaido. But while Trump has said ""every option is on the table"" in Venezuela, suggesting the use of military force, Brazil has pushed for diplomatic talks to lead to a change in power.
A senior administration official said Brazil plays an important role as an ""interlocutor"" between the U.S. and Venezuela.
""Brazil has allowed the United States to preposition humanitarian aid for Venezuela on Brazil's northern border and we are very grateful to that and we thank him for working tirelessly to provide aide to the Brazilian people and them opening their doors,"" the official said. ""There's also an opportunity here where they can be very good interlocutors. The Brazilian Military has very good relationships with the Venezuelan military and clearly communicate with them as to what should be the role with the Venezuelan military in regards to civility and not repressing and not maintaining the usurpation of democracy Maduro seeks.""
The U.S. and Brazil hope to end the meetings with signed agreements, including an agreement that would allow the U.S. to launch satellites and rockets into space from Brazil.
""You will see -- after the visit tomorrow, we will plan to announce a joint statement that will have a lot of deliverables, some which are currently, frankly, right now being signed and being finalized and being negotiated. And that's all extraordinarily positive,"" an official said Monday. ""We think that we have, really, a historic opportunity to re-frame hemispheric relations with this North-South axis."""
New body cam video shows deadly North Carolina police shooting of 27-year-old,Emily Shapiro,"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 14:51:00 GMT",N/A,"Newly-released body camera footage reveals the dramatic and deadly police shooting of a 27-year-old man who authorities say was armed in a North Carolina parking lot.
A judge granted the release of the tense body camera footage on Monday. But the shooting unfolded on the morning of March 25, after the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said two 911 calls came within minutes reporting an armed man at a business.
""The first caller frantically said she needed police quickly"" because a suspect went behind the counter with a gun and pointed it at an employee, police said in a statement on Monday. ""The second caller frantically said she needed police because an individual had approached her vehicle while she was waiting for food in the parking lot of the business and pulled out a gun.""
When two officers reached the parking lot, they saw Danquirs Franklin squatting next to an open car door, said police.
Both officers pointed guns at Franklin, who was black, and repeatedly told him to ""put the gun down.""
Franklin remained crouched on the ground of the parking lot, next to an open car door, facing the inside of the car.
When one of the officers ""perceived an imminent, deadly threat,"" she fired her gun twice, hitting Franklin, said police. The 27-year-old was taken to a hospital, where he died, said police.
In the blink of an eye, their jobs require an instantaneous decision and that it something none of us should take lightly.
Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said the video showed ""the instant where a mother lost her son, children lost their father and a young man had his life end much too soon.""
""It's another really sad moment and reminder that the responsibilities of law enforcement are and will always be immense,"" she said Monday. ""In the blink of an eye, their jobs require an instantaneous decision and that it something none of us should take lightly.""
Just before the video was released, Lyles told reporters Monday, ""I believe it's the duty of responsible leaders to get out in front of an event like this, to ensure everyone in our city that we are dedicated to the pursuit of truth and justice.""
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney described the video as ""like a punch to the gut. It's hard to watch ... because a life has been lost. ""
But Putney added there is ""clear and compelling evidence"" Franklin was armed.
The mayor and police said they are prepared for peaceful protests.
""I call on all of Charlotte to come together respectfully,"" Lyles stressed. ""How we respond as a community will reflect how we honor the memory of Danquirs Franklin.""
""I hope you’ll do what we're doing and pray for Miss Franklin and her family. Pray for our officers, whose lives have been destroyed, as well,"" Putney said. ""And come together as a community and be heard. But be lawful.”
The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police's homicide unit is investigative the shooting, and once that is completed, the evidence will be turned over to the Mecklenburg County District Attorney’s Office for review, the department said Monday.
Wende Kerl, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer who shot Franklin, was placed on paid administrative leave, the department said in March. Kerl has been with the department for over 20 years.
The department's internal affairs bureau ""will conduct a separate but parallel investigation to determine whether CMPD [Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department] policies and procedures were adhered to,"" the department said in March.

Michigan AG to review 2015 fatal shooting by ICE agent,The Associated Press,"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 13:39:00 GMT",N/A,"DETROIT -- Michigan's attorney general will look into the fatal shooting of a 20-year-old man by a U.S. customs agent during a 2015 police raid in Detroit.
Laura Moody, chief of staff for Attorney General Dana Nessel, says in a letter to Terrance Kellom's family that the case ""will be reviewed by an experienced criminal attorney.""
Police have said Kellom was shot after lunging at the agent with a hammer at his father's home. His father, Kevin Kellom, has disputed that account. The agent wasn't charged.
Nabih Ayad, a lawyer representing Kellom's family, says an officer who earlier said Kellom had a hammer changed his story while under oath in the family's civil suit against the agent.
The Wayne County prosecutor's office said last week that it was reviewing new information in the case."
"As Mueller report release nears, White House prepares robust response: Sources",Katherine Faulders,"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 13:51:00 GMT",N/A,"While President Donald Trump and the White House are uncertain about what exactly will be revealed in special counsel Robert Mueller's report when Attorney General William Barr clears its release to the public on Thursday, sources say they are preparing an aggressive response.
Sources say the initial response will look much as it did when Mueller first transmitted the report to Barr late last month, which was expressing relief over Barr’s general conclusions.
""He anticipates the end of this just like everyone else,"" a source with knowledge of the president's thinking said. The president's two top White House lawyers, Pat Cipollone and Emmet Flood, are expected to be among the White House officials reading the report.
Barr and a select few of his associates have been reviewing Mueller's 400-plus page report in recent weeks and making redactions. ABC News has learned that the White House has received a broad briefing on the report -- described as non-specific in nature, focused mostly on the mechanics of the report itself -- including that it will be divided into sections on obstruction and collusion and that certain portions will be redacted, according to sources familiar with the matter.
White House officials and sources close to the administration say advisers to the president are most concerned about the possibility of previously unknown examples of potential obstruction of justice and what information Mueller's team learned from witness interviews, especially former White House Counsel Don McGahn who sat for well over 30 hours with Mueller's investigators.
Sources say the president hasn't privately expressed any concern over the contents of the report, and is not likely to read it in its entirety. White House officials will review the report, brief the president, and then release a statement that will come from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.
""I heard it's going to come out on Thursday. That's good. And there can't be anything there because there was no crime. There was no anything,"" Trump told ABC News affiliate KSTP Monday in Minnesota. ""The crime was committed by the other side. This crime was all made up. It was all a fabrication.""
Members of the communications staff are also likely to make the rounds on television to speak about the report's release and defend the president.
A second source close to the president said the White House expects no information in the report will implicate the president legally, based on Barr’s release of the principal conclusions; however, the source expects ""it will have some statements that are bad PR-wise.""
While the president hasn't privately expressed any concern over the contents of the report, sources say he is using his recent tweets attacking the report as a way to distract from any negative revelations on Thursday.
The president is also expected to travel to Mar-a-Lago for the Easter weekend on Thursday, sources say, and depending on what's revealed, Trump could speak to reporters as he leaves the White House."
Abortion rights group asks Supreme Court to strike Louisiana admitting privileges law,Devin Dwyer,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 10:14:00 GMT",N/A,"Abortion rights advocates have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to summarily strike down a controversial Louisiana law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.
The court in February, by a 5-4 vote, temporarily put the law on hold – hours before it was set to take effect -- pending an expected appeal from the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing a Louisiana abortion clinic and two physicians.
The organization is challenging a decision by the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upholding the Louisiana law.
“The stakes in this case are high for the rule of law, and the real world consequences for women in Louisiana could be dire,” said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. “Abortion access in the state is already hanging by a thread. The number of clinics has already fallen from 11 in 2001 to just 3 today.”
The group says enforcement of the law would impose a near-impossible standard for abortion providers to meet, citing administrative hurdles to securing admitting privileges across the state.
“The doctors in our case and throughout Louisiana who provide abortions engaged in extensive efforts to obtain privileges and virtually all of them were shut out,” said T.J. Tu, the lead attorney on the case.
In 2016, the Supreme Court struck down a similar law in Texas, saying the rules effectively imposed an “undue burden” on women’s right to access an abortion by reducing the number of available providers.
“So blatant is the 5th Circuit’s refusal to follow [that precedent] that we are asking in our petition for a summary reversal,” Northup said. “That’s how clear cut this case is. There’s no need for new arguments.”
Supporters of the Louisiana law say the admitting-privileges requirement is a reasonable restriction to ensure the health and safety of women seeking abortions.
“We urge the Court to grant cert in this case so that the Justices can take a closer look at the facts themselves and let the law stand,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List.
“Louisiana legislators on both sides of the aisle enacted this law to protect women from the abortion lobby which repeatedly puts profit over health and safety standards, and has proven incapable of policing itself,” she said in a statement when the law was first put on hold.
Kathaleen Pittman, clinic administrator at one Louisiana abortion provider, said health care workers are already seeing an uptick in cases of attempted “self-abortions” because of shrinking options for women.
“We do anticipate a rise in self-abortions. We’ve seen it reported to us, especially from women coming to us from Texas, of trying alternative means,” Pittman said. “Women are going to have abortions, the question is: will they be illegal and unsafe, or legal and safe?”
Louisiana authorities have 30 days to file a response with the Supreme Court. While it is possible the justices could grant their petition this term, it’s more likely they do so during the October term, the parties said."
"As Trump attacks Omar, progressive Democrats unhappy with Pelosi's defense",Mariam Khan,"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 15:11:00 GMT",N/A,"Even as President Donald Trump continues his feud with Rep. Ilhan Omar, liberals are criticizing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of not defending the freshman Muslim congresswoman quickly or strongly enough.
In an interview with local television station KSTP during a trip to Minnesota on Monday, Trump was asked if he had any regrets about his Friday tweet accusing Omar of downplaying the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
“No, not at all,” Trump said. “Look, she’s been very disrespectful to this country. She’s been very disrespectful, frankly, to Israel. She is somebody that doesn’t really understand, I think life, real life, what it’s all about. It’s unfortunate. She’s got a way about her that’s very, very bad I think for our country. I think she’s extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country.”
On Tuesday, Pelosi, on a congressional trip to London, was asked during an interview with CNN if she agrees with her critics that she did not defend Omar swiftly enough.
""Well, I haven't had a chance to speak with her, I'm traveling,"" Pelosi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.
She added: ""I don't even know what was said, but do I know what the president did was not right.""
On Friday, the president tweeted a video that used footage of 9/11 with comments Omar made at the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The 43-second video captures Omar saying ""some people did something,” in reference to terrorists who killed thousands when they crashed planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania. The video, which features dramatic music and video of the chaos in downtown Manhattan, asks ""Some people did something?”
But it does not show the entirety of Omar’s comments.
""For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I’m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,” Omar said at CAIR in California last March. ""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.”
Omar went on to say that the 9/11 attacks changed how Muslims are viewed in America and encouraged Muslims to not tolerate being treated as ""second-class” citizens.
Republicans have criticized the seemingly passive reference to the terrorists who carried out the attacks, while Omar's defenders have countered that the remarks were largely taken out of context and have been seized on in order to stoke anti-Islamic sentiment against the Muslim congresswoman.
Pelosi condemned Trump for the video, but she did not initially mention Omar, who was the target of Trump’s video, by name.
“Since the President’s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life—many directly referencing or replying to the President’s video,"" Omar said in a statement Sunday evening. ""I thank the Capitol Police, the FBI, the House Sergeant at Arms, and the Speaker of the House for their attention to these threats.""
Pelosi confirmed Sunday that she personally spoke with the House Sergeant-at-Arms in order to ensure the safety of Omar, as well as her family and staff.
“The President’s words weigh a ton, and his hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger,"" Pelosi said. ""President Trump must take down his disrespectful and dangerous video.”
Fellow Democratic freshman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York called on Democrats to respond to Trump’s tweet and cautioned that if they were to remain silent, they would be “complicit” in Trump’s attacks.
""Members of Congress have a duty to respond to the President’s explicit attack today.@IlhanMN’s life is in danger. For our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote.
“Has Nancy Pelosi ever visited a mosque in this country?” said Waleed Shahid, spokesman for the liberal group Justice Democrats in a tweet.
Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill forcefully denied Shahid's suggestion in an emailed response to ABC News saying ""...the Speaker has been to many mosques in this country and throughout the world.""
""This one group attacking the Speaker believes it’s more important to raise money for their own organization than condemn the President’s disgusting and vile attacks on Democrats,"" Hammill said of the Justice Democrats group.
On the president's attacks against Omar, Hammill said: ""The President is making these attacks because of the imminent release of the Mueller report in a desperate attempt to change the subject.""
Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who is also Muslim, expressed frustration over how Democratic leadership was handling Trump’s attacks against Omar.
""They put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse,"" Tlaib tweeted over the weekend, slamming top Democrats for failing to defend Omar from Trump’s Islamophobic attacks while also insinuating their diversity is a prop for the Democratic Party.
""However, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for & why we ran in the first place, we are ignored,"" she continued, re-tweeting a California state legislative aide who criticized ""the attacks on @IlhanMN and subsequent lack of support from Democratic leadership.""
Just hours after Omar released a statement reporting a surge of threats against her life following a tweeted attack from Trump, Trump again took aim at Omar on Monday by describing her as Pelosi’s “leader.""
""Before Nancy, who has lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done, decides to defend her leader, Rep. Omar, she should look at the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements Omar has made,"" Trump tweeted. ""She is out of control, except for her control of Nancy!""
Pelosi is also taking heat for remarks she made Monday at the London School of Economics, in which she seemingly downplayed her and Ocasio-Cortez’s stunning midterm election victories.
“When we won this election, it wasn’t in districts like mine or Alexandria’s. And she’s a wonderful member of Congress, I think all of our colleagues will attest,” the California Democrat said.
“But those are districts that are solidly Democratic. This glass of water would win with a ""D"" next to its name in those districts,” she said as she hoisted a glass of water.
Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, and Omar all represent a new progressive wing of the Democratic Party that is calling for Medicare for all, free college tuition, and a more forceful response to fight climate change.
Pelosi warned Democrats about taking the party too far left, saying “our message, our progressive message, is down the middle.”

What we've learned from 2020 candidates' tax returns,"Benjamin Siegel 
and","Wed, 17 Apr 2019 01:41:00 GMT",N/A,"A handful of Democratic candidates for president have released at least 10 years of federal tax returns in an effort to promote transparency and create a contrast with President Donald Trump, who's refused to release his returns both as a candidate and as president.
Here are some of the notable takeaways from the new financial data of Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke:
What they're earning
One of the most apparent takeaways from a candidates' tax documents is how much they're making each year.
All the candidates reported making more than $200,000, filed jointly with their spouses, in adjusted gross income in 2018, putting them substantially above an average American's earnings, ranging from Harris, ($1.9 million) and Warren ($846,394), to Inslee ($202,912).
Of the seven 2020 candidates to release returns, at least three are millionaires: Sanders, Warren and Harris.
Sanders, famous for his campaign against the unjust power of the richest 1%, reported an adjusted gross income of $1.06 million in 2016 and $1.13 million in 2017. The bump in income those years was more than four times his income from a year earlier because of his bestselling 2016 book, ""Our Revolution.""
The senator, who joked before the release of his returns that if someone else wrote a bestselling book they, too, could be a millionaire, later said he was ""grateful"" for the financial success and that it marked a sharp contrast to his upbringing in a paycheck-to-paycheck household.
Warren, who's also made anti-corruption a key focus of her campaign, is also part of the 1%, the documents show. Her adjusted gross income in 2018, after filing jointly with her husband, exceeded $846,000. Between 2013 and 2015, her adjusted gross income was over $1 million and neared $1.55 million in 2014 after her first book was released.
Harris reported the highest 2018 gross income at $1.89 million. Her husband, an attorney whom she married in 2014, earned most of their income. For 2018, Harris reported just over $157,000 in Senate salary and $320,125 in profits from the book she authored ahead of her campaign announcement.
Gillibrand reported $214,083 in adjusted gross income for 2018 and Klobuchar reported $338,121. O'Rourke has yet to submit his 2018 returns, but reported $366,455 for 2017.
How much are they giving to charity?
The most generous candidate in 2018, according to candidates' tax returns, was Warren. She and her husband gave $50,128 to charity, almost 6% of her household adjusted gross income for the year.
Next up was Inslee, who donated about 4% of his and his wife's income, or about $8,300.
In comparison to other Americans with similar adjusted gross incomes, Warren donated about twice the average percentage -- which is about 2.7% for an income between $500,000 and $1 million, the latest IRS figures show. Inslee, who reported earning nearly $203,000 in 2018, donated about one and a half times more than the average percentage for someone of the same income.
Sanders and his wife gave about 3.3% of their income to charity over the past two years. They gave $18,950 in 2018 and $36,300 in 2017. The couple also donated the proceeds of one of the senator's books, ""The Speech,"" though the donations did not appear on their tax returns, according to the campaign. The donations have gone primarily to ""senior centers, low-income organizations, educational entities and environmental and housing advocacy groups,"" the campaign said.
Sanders donated about the same as the average for similar income, according to IRS figures.
Klobuchar and Gillibrand donated about 2% of their adjusted gross income in 2018, coming to nearly $6,600 for Klobuchar and $3,750 for Gillibrand. Klobuchar and Gillibrand's donations also match up with the average percentage that people at those income levels donate, IRS figures show.
O'Rourke appeared to give the smallest percentage of his family's income to charity in 2017 -- a total of $1,166, or 0.3%, which falls below the average percent donated by someone of his income level, while Harris and her husband donated $27,000, about 1.4% -- less than half of what the average is for similar adjusted gross incomes, according to IRS data.
On average, those who earn between $1.5 million and $2 million donate around 3.4% of their income to charity, the latest IRS figures show.
Roughly half of all charitable donations come from households with annual incomes of at least $100,000, IRS figures show, but the percentage doesn't usually skyrocket as wealth increases. For example, while the average donation for an income bracket between $500,000 and $1 million is 2%, the average donation for those who earn at least 10-20 times more money, $10 million a year or more, is around 10.4%.
""The thing that's really shocking is, as incomes go up, people's propensity to give doesn't grow proportionally,"" said Len Burman, a co-founder of the Tax Policy Project. Burman tracked the donations by candidates in the 2012 election and found some, like former President Barack Obama and candidate Mitt Romney, gave around 14% of their income to charity, while candidates like Newt Gingrich gave around 2.6%.
""If you're well off, you probably have an obligation to share with people who are needy,"" Burman said.
Charitable donations can be tracked only after candidates release their returns, a tradition that has continued since former President Richard Nixon was in office -- but some point out that none of this information, which is often scrutinized, is required to be provided by law.
""If the biggest complaint [voters] can have from all these returns is whether ... the candidate is charitable enough, then this is a victory for all these candidates,"" Tony Nitti, a CPA and partner at Rubin Brown LLP, told ABC News.
""The fact that you have the transparency allows us to go through this exercise, so we know that there's nothing to worry about,"" Nitti said.
How much of their income is paid in <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/taxes"" id=""_ap_link_taxes_Taxes_"" target=""_blank"">taxes</a>?
The Democrats who released their returns all appear to be paying their fair share of taxes given their income, said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the right-leaning Cato Institute.
""None of these folks are seemingly cheating or getting away with anything,"" he told ABC News after reviewing the returns made public by the campaigns.
Harris and her husband, earning about $1.9 million, paid at an effective tax rate of 37%, the highest among candidates who've disclosed returns. Gillibrand, who reported earning $214,083, had an effective tax rate of 14%, according to her returns.
Sanders, who released 10 years of returns Monday, had an effective federal tax rate of 26% in 2018, paying $145,840 in federal taxes on adjusted gross income of $561,293.
Warren, with an adjusted gross income of $846,394 in 2018, paid 27%.
With an adjusted gross income of $366,455 in 2017, O'Rourke had an effective tax rate of 22%.
Klobuchar, who had a 2018 adjusted gross income of $338,121, and Inslee, who had a 2018 adjusted gross income of $202,912, round out the list with some of the lowest tax rates of 19% and 15%, respectively.
""There are often complaints that rich people are able to take lots of loopholes,"" Edwards said, referencing billionaire Warren Buffett's often-cited comments that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. ""None of these candidates seem to be as lucky as Warren Buffett. They are paying tax rates as high as people with similar incomes.""
While little is known about the president's returns, The New York Times reported last year that the president and his siblings allegedly used fake corporations to hide money received from their parents to avoid paying tens of millions of dollars in taxes.
The White House called The Times report a ""misleading attack against the Trump family"" and claimed the IRS signed off on the transactions detailed in the report.
Keep in mind: Most Democrats (as well as the president) have yet to release their returns
While five candidates have released years of tax returns, most among the nearly 20 Democrats seeking the White House in 2020 have yet to do so.
The president has refused to release his, and the White House vows he likely won't.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush set the record for tax information released by a presidential candidate in 2016 by disclosing 33 years of returns.
The early disclosures, more than a year away from the election, are significant and represent a ""shift"" in the Democratic Party, Joe Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project, told ABC News.
""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why,"" he said.

"Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former personal attorney and long-time fixer, disbarred in New York",Aaron Katersky,"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 13:34:00 GMT",N/A,"Michael Cohen has been officially disbarred in New York, per a decision from the First Department of the Appellate Division, New York State Supreme Court which was issued Tuesday as President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney and long-time fixer testified behind closed doors on Capitol Hill.
Cohen’s guilty pleas on charges of tax evasion, making an excessive campaign contribution and lying to Congress ensured he would be disbarred. The decision from the Attorney Grievance Committee for the First Judicial Department made it official.
The decision noted Cohen “ceased to be an attorney upon his federal conviction of making false statements to the United States Congress” and said his “name is stricken from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law in the State of New York.”
Cohen, who has practiced law since 1992, is scheduled to report to prison in May to begin serving a three-year sentence.
Cohen spent Tuesday testifying in a closed session of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He is set for public testimony Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee."
Republican at center of North Carolina election fraud scandal will not run in new election,Adam Kelsey,"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 20:10:00 GMT",N/A,"Mark Harris, the Republican candidate in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District election in 2018, said Tuesday that he will not run in the district's forthcoming special election, a race ordered by state officials after evidence of election fraud ""tainted"" results that had shown Harris as the first-place finisher.
Harris shared his decision, citing health issues requiring surgery, in a press release Tuesday afternoon.
He disclosed his medical issues publicly with the North Carolina State Board of Elections last week during his testimony at an evidentiary hearing on potential election fraud in the race.
""Given my health situation, the need to regain full strength, and the timing of this surgery the last week of March, I have decided not to file in the new election for Congressional District 9,"" Harris said in the statement, adding that he owed it to his family to make the ""wisest decision for [his] health.""
The decision is the latest development in the race and subsequent investigation. In the last week alone, Harris' son testified that he warned his father about hiring McCrae Dowless, the man at the center of the absentee ballot-collection scandal called into question by investigators; Harris himself conceded that a new election should be called; the state board voted to move forward with a special election; and Dan McCready, the Democrat who finished second to Harris by just over 900 votes in November, re-launched his candidacy for the new race.
In a statement, the North Carolina Republican Party said it was supportive of Harris' decision, writing that it ""unequivocally support[s] his call for a new election,"" and that ""there are numerous quality candidates that are discussing a run."" In his statement, Harris endorsed one of those potential candidates, Union County, North Carolina Commissioner Stony Rushing.
The state board of elections has yet to set a date for the district's new primary and general election. Last December, former Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger -- whom Harris defeated in a primary last year to earn his spot on the general election ballot -- said that he would not run again if there were to be a new election, and on Monday, former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory also ruled out a run.

"President Trump again blasts John McCain, says he was 'never a fan' and 'never will be'",Jordyn Phelps,"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 10:15:00 GMT",N/A,"President Donald Trump again criticized the late Sen. John McCain Tuesday, pointing specifically to his vote against repealing Obamacare and saying was “never a fan"" and ""never will be.""
“I'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know. He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years and then they got to a vote and he said thumbs down,” Trump said. “Plus there were other things. I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.”
The president's comments came during an Oval Office meeting with the president of Brazil and after a series of weekend tweets in which Trump blasted the senator, who passed away battling brain cancer in last August.
Trump accused him of “spreading the fake and totally discredited dossier” and of sending it to the FBI and the media “hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election.” But the president’s claim is not accurate. McCain wasn’t made aware of the dossier until after the election when he passed it on to the FBI.
The dossier, compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Along with other explosive allegations, it alleged that Russians held compromising information about Trump that could be used to blackmail him.
On ABC's ""The View"" on Monday, McCain's daughter Meghan fired back at Trump, saying he ""spends his weekend obsessing over great men"" because ""he will never be a great man"" like her father.

Plea deal offered to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft in solicitation of prostitution case,Chris Francescani,"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 13:23:00 GMT",N/A,"Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, is being offered a deferred prosecution agreement in which he would not be required to plead guilty to any charges surrounding his visits to a Florida spa in January that was under investigation for sex trafficking and prostitution, a prosecutor in the case announced on Tuesday.
Kraft is facing two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution for allegedly visiting the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida on two occasions earlier this year and paying for sexual favors from the massage parlor’s staff.
The proposed pre-trial diversion program would require Kraft to either acknowledge guilt or admit that he would have been proven guilty at trial, according to the spokesperson for the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office, Mike Edmondson.
While Kraft is currently facing a statutory maximum of one year in jail, if he were to accept the plea agreement, the misdemeanor charges would be dropped. As part of the statute, Kraft would have to perform 100 hours of community service, attend a class on the dangers of prostitution and pay a $5,000 fine per count, according to Edmondson.
The deal has been offered to Kraft and 24 other men charged in the case. No one has accepted the deal so far, Edmondson said.
The Wall Street Journal first reported news of a proposed deal.
Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg tweeted in response to the newspaper's tweet of their story on the plea deal that...""The offer of a deferred prosecution agreement with several conditions to first time offenders is standard in cases like this.""
It was not immediately clear whether Kraft would accept such an offer. None of his three primary defense attorneys immediately responded to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Jupiter Police Department, which conducted the investigation, referred requests for comment to the prosecutor's office.
The Patriots team owner had pleaded not guilty and opted for a non-jury trial, before a judge -- while assembling a powerhouse team of high-profile Florida criminal defense attorneys.
Florida criminal defense attorney Mark O’Mara said that the Kraft deal is best outcome he could hope for short of a dismissal of the charges.
“In a pre-trial diversion, you divert the case away from the criminal justice system into what I’d call a pre-plea probation,” said O’Mara, who won George Zimmerman’s acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges in the fatal 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin.
""This is a variant of a pre-trial diversion ... In my opinion, a deferred prosecution agreement is much more informal, more of a letter contract between the prosecution and the defense,"" O'Mara said.
“It’s the best deal he can get, but I give kudos to his defense attorneys because they worked out the best deal they could without a complete dismissal. It’s the best of all worlds, because you’re not entering a plea.”
O’Mara said such deals are generally reserved for first-time offenders.
Even with the charges dropped, Kraft could still face discipline from the National Football League (NFL), which has a strict personal conduct policy.
The policy reads, in part, that ""[i]t is not enough simply to avoid being found guilty of a crime. We are all held to a higher standard and must conduct ourselves in a way that is responsible, promotes the values of the NFL, and is lawful.""
Twenty-five people were charged in the sting at the Jupiter spa, police said. Authorities set up hidden cameras at the spa and, Jupiter Police Detective Andrew Sharp said, there's video evidence of all of the suspects participating in the alleged sexual acts.
Stacey James, a spokeswoman for Kraft, 77, said in a statement at the time that ""[w]e categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity. Because it is a judicial matter, we will not be commenting further.""
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has punished Kraft's Patriots more severely than any other franchise during his tenure, according to ESPN. He fined them $250,000, and coach Bill Belichick $500,000, for spying on an opponent's defensive signals in 2007. He fined the Patriots $1 million, stripped them of two draft choices and suspended quarterback Tom Brady as part of the 2015 ""Deflategate"" investigation.
News of the charges being dropped came the same day that a coalition of sexual exploitation and sex trafficking survivor networks wrote a letter calling on Goodell to investigate criminal charges against Kraft and if found to be true to strip him of ownership of the Super Bowl champions franchise, according to a letter released by the coalition on Tuesday.
“If the results of [an NFL] investigation show Mr. Kraft to have engaged in the purchase of women for sex, the NFL must banish Mr. Kraft from team ownership because men who purchase others for sex inflict inestimable amounts of human suffering on those they exploit for sex,” the letter reads, which goes on to call for the sports league to “take immediate action, rigorous measures to create a corporate and sport culture that respects others by rejecting all forms of sexual objectification, harassment, assault, and exploitation of women by owners, coaches, players, team personnel, and others associated with the NFL.”
“The prostitution marketplace is the context in which most sexual exploitation and sex trafficking transpire. The prostitution marketplace encompasses any of the various modes by which prostitution is marketed: strip clubs, massage parlors, ‘escort’ services, Internet-based prostitution websites, brothels, as well as pimp-facilitated, street-level prostitution, and pornography (i.e. – prostitution for mass consumption.)”
The coalition, which includes groups like Breaking the Silence Together, Veronica’s Voice, Freedom From Exploitation, Inc., DIGNITY House and the Survivor Leader Network, cite the NFL’s own Personal Conduct Policy, which describes misconduct as “conduct by anyone in the league that is illegal, violent, dangerous, or irresponsibl[y] put innocent victims at risk, damages the reputation of others in the game, or undercuts public support for the NFL.”
The NFL's media representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.
The allegations against Kraft come three weeks after the Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the team's sixth Super Bowl title.
This year marks the 25th anniversary of Kraft's then-NFL record $175 million purchase of the Patriots in 1994.

Trump vetoes resolution to end US involvement in Yemen,Conor Finnegan,"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 18:44:00 GMT",N/A,"President Donald Trump has vetoed a resolution to stop U.S. military assistance to the Saudi- and Emirati-led campaign in Yemen.
In issuing the veto, Trump said, ""This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities.""
Earlier this month, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution to stop U.S. involvement in the foreign conflict, with several Republicans joining Democrats in large part to send a message about the Trump administration's unwavering support for the Saudis. The House approved the resolution on April 4, and the Senate passed the measure on March 13.
This is the second veto of Trump's presidency. Congress does not have the two-thirds majority in the House or Senate to override Trump's veto.
""The President has cynically chosen to contravene a bipartisan, bicameral vote of the Congress and perpetuate America’s shameful involvement in this heartbreaking crisis,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement Tuesday.
Under the constitution, Congress has the authority to declare war, but it has never used the War Powers Act of 1973 to pull back American forces from a conflict. Beginning under the Obama administration in 2015, the U.S. has assisted the Saudis and Emiratis with midair refueling, reconnaissance and surveillance, and targeting.
The Trump administration argued that the assistance did not constitute active engagement in the hostilities, which is why Trump called the resolution ""unnecessary."" Trump's veto statement also blasted the resolution as ""dangerous"" for imposing an ""arbitrary"" timeline on U.S. involvement and undermining his administration's ""efforts to prevent civilian casualties and prevent the spread of terrorist organizations such as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS.""
But the resolution explicitly provided a carve-out for U.S. military action against those two terror groups, who operate in Yemen in the shadows of the civil war that has pitted the Saudi coalition-backed government against Houthi rebels, who have become increasingly supported by Iran.
Supporters of the resolution also argued that after years of conflict, U.S. withdrawal was not arbitrary, but a needed catalyst to push the Saudis to engage in peace talks.
""The people of Yemen and the parties to the conflict are watching closely and the messages U.S. leaders send have the power to save lives. With a veto, they lose faith in the United States and see the end to their suffering a little further out of reach,"" said Scott Paul, humanitarian policy lead for Oxfam America, an NGO that works in Yemen.
For years, Democrats in Congress had been joined by some Republicans in trying to pass a War Powers Resolution for Yemen, but similar measures were defeated in both chambers when Republicans were in charge. After the murder of Washington Post columnist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, however, Republicans have grown increasingly concerned about Trump's close relationship with Saudi Arabia.
A broad bipartisan group passed the resolution for the first time in the Senate in December, with a vote again in this Congress once the measure passed the now-Democrat controlled House in February.
The conflict in Yemen has been ongoing for five years, killing thousands and triggering a massive famine. The United Nations has described the situation in Yemen as the world's most severe humanitarian crisis, with millions starving and facing diseases like cholera.
Despite the veto, the resolution's authors vowed to carry on their mission to end U.S. support for the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition, and the veto could trigger more support for other legislation to penalize the Saudis for their role in the Yemen conflict and Khashoggi's murder.

5 takeaways from the 1st major fundraising reports of the 2020 presidential race,John Verhovek,"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 14:21:00 GMT",N/A,"Presidential candidates submitted their first quarter fundraising reports to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and it's the first major barometer of who is breaking through in a crowded field and how well-resourced campaigns could be for the long race ahead.
But amid the clamor to scour the latest filings for indications of who's up and who's down, it's important to remember that a good fundraising haul is no guarantee of votes or viability. And that uncertainty will continue to reign in the early stages of a historically diverse Democratic primary with well over a dozen declared candidates.
The reports show an incumbent Republican president eager to build a war-chest sufficient enough to hold off any potential challenger, and a Democratic race that will undoubtedly remain competitive up until the first nominating contests in 2020. It is also important to note that while former Vice President Joe Biden has not officially entered the race, he is presumably a candidate who would draw major interest from donors of all sizes.
Here are five major takeaways from the reports filed with the FEC.
Top dollars
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont topped the Democratic field in the money race with relative ease, bringing in an $18.2 million total haul, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris of California who brought in nearly $12 million. Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke raked in $9.4 million in the first quarter of 2019, including a $6.1 million haul in the first 24 hours of his campaign, a total that surpassed even Sanders initial haul.
South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg brought in an unexpectedly impressive haul for a candidate who is still introducing himself on the national stage. Buttigieg, who officially announced his candidacy this past weekend, brought in over $7 million in the first quarter from over 155,000 individual donors, outpacing the four other U.S. senators in the race and cementing his status as a top-tier candidate in the campaign's early stages.
""Mayor Pete"" also had a relatively low burn rate, spending just $685,000 -- or less than 10 percent -- of his total fundraising haul.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren brought in just over $6 million, followed by her Senate colleagues: Amy Klobuchar with $5.2 million; Cory Booker with $5 million; and Kirsten Gillibrand with $3 million -- putting them all in the middle of the pack in terms of fundraising.
In another surprise, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who raised $2.4 million in the first quarter, outpaced two governors in the race, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Colorado's former Gov. John Hickenlooper. Yang also outraised as Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and former Maryland Congressman John Delaney, who loaned his campaign $11.7 million.
In terms of cash on hand, Sanders also holds a significant advantage over the field, with $15.7 million in the bank.
The early numbers also revealed the advantage sitting U.S. senators -- who ran re-election campaigns in 2018 -- have over the field. Both Warren and Gillibrand transferred large sums from their Senate campaigns -- Warren $10.4 million and Gillibrand $9.6 million -- which gives them some more flexibility to spend more money early. Warren spent 87 percent of the money she raised from individual contributions in the first quarter and Gillibrand burned through 81 percent, both at much higher rates than the rest of the field.
Grassroots success
A big theme emerging this cycle is the emphasis on the number of individual donors giving to a specific campaign, both for its indication of a candidates' grassroots support and because it is now one of the main criteria set forth by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for making the debate stage.
Sanders again led the pack, announcing earlier this month that his $18.1 million came from 525,000 individual donors, well beyond the 65,000 required by the DNC and outpacing all of his rivals.
Not all campaigns released individual donor numbers, but Warren said her haul came from 135,000 individual donors, while Buttigieg claimed over 155,000. Yang said his campaign had 80,000 individual donors to his campaign during February and March.
Both Harris and O'Rourke's campaigns said their totals came from 218,000 individual contributions.
According to the FEC filings, there were seven campaigns that raised a majority of their money from donors who gave $200 or less: Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg, Yang, O'Rourke, Gabbard and author Marianne Williamson.
On the flip side, Gillibrand, Booker, Hickenlooper and Delaney all saw under 20 percent of their donations come from people who gave $200 or less.
With a larger emphasis on small-dollar donations and a rejection of corporate money, expect the jockeying for the grassroots fundraising mantle to continue throughout the Democratic primary.
Trump's advantage
While the field of Democrats battled for fundraising supremacy, President Donald Trump's re-election campaign announced a more than $30 million haul in the first quarter of 2019, outpacing his top two rivals from the opposing party combined.
According to numbers released Monday morning by the Trump campaign, the commander-in-chief took in $30.3 million and has $40.8 million cash on hand.
The campaign did not release the number of individual donors to the president's re-election campaign but claimed to ""have already enlisted 100,000 new small donors in 2019,"" and to have ""acquired more than one million new small donors"" since Trump was inaugurated in January 2017.
Along with the numbers reported by the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee announced Monday that it raised an additional $45.8 million in the first quarter of 2019, bringing the total pro-Trump fundraising effort to over $76 million, with $82 million cash on hand.
Since his unlikely rise and victory in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Trump has proven to be a consistently productive fundraiser, and the advantages that come with running as an incumbent president will likely aid that prowess as he seeks a second term.
Famous names
As always, the first round of FEC reports provide a unique opportunity to see who is donating to which campaigns at the outset.
Harris, one of two California-based candidates in the race, received donations from a number of famous names, such as actors Ben Affleck, Reese Witherspoon, Eva Longoria, Jon Hamm, Wanda Sykes, Taran Killam and Jon Cryer, as well as producers J.J. Abrams and Shonda Rhimes.
Among Booker's most high-profile donors include NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, former Google head Eric Schmidt, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and musician Jon Bon Jovi. Booker also received donations from actress Rosario Dawson, who he is currently dating.
Sanders received donations from actors Danny DeVito, Susan Sarandon and Thomas Middleditch, as well as musician Norah Jones.
Yang, who has seen an uptick in attention in part due to the online engagement in his campaign, received $1,000 donations from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Weezer front-man Rivers Cuomo and actor Noah Centineo, who starred in the Netflix film ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before.""
Buttigieg also saw a number of donations from famous names like actors Mandy Moore, Ryan Reynolds and Bradley Whitford, former national security adviser and United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice and James Murdoch, the son of conservative media titan Rupert Murdoch.
Trump's over $30 million haul saw a wide range of donors, including one of his biggest backers in 2016, Robert Mercer. The prolific conservative donor gave $5,400 in the first quarter of 2019 to the president's re-election campaign.
Many of Trump's most high-profile backers, like casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, donate to outside groups and super PACs backing GOP causes. Adelson and his wife Miriam donated over $100 million to GOP-aligned groups during the 2018 midterm elections, and are expected to be among Trump's biggest financial supporters during his re-election efforts.
Early signs of trouble?
As the data continues to be scrutinized, there has been some worry among Democrats that these numbers, even for top-tier candidates like Sanders and Harris, are lower than 2008, which was the last time the party saw a competitive primary. In 2007, both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama raised more than $25 million in the first quarter, albeit against a less-crowded field which may be causing some donors to pause before deciding who they are backing.
According to an analysis by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan, independent and nonprofit outlet that tracks campaign finance data, the initial first quarter numbers appear to lag behind what the party saw in 2007.
In additional to the potentially troubling overall numbers, both Warren and Gillibrand's early burn rates may signal difficulty in sustaining their campaigns all the way until the first ballots are cast in February 2020.
Warren took a significant step when her campaign announced that she would not be holding high-dollar fundraisers during the Democratic primary, a decision that played well to a party base that is rewarding candidates who shirk the traditional norms of fundraising but may present a challenge to her when it comes to maintaining her war chest."
State's Attorney Kim Foxx calls Jussie Smollett 'washed up celeb who lied' and R. Kelly 'pedophile' in texts,Karma Allen,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 09:12:00 GMT",N/A,"Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx referred to ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett as a ""washed up celeb who lied to cops,"" according to newly revealed text messages.
Foxx made the comment to her top deputy, Joseph Magats, on March 8, just as news surfaced that the actor had been indicted on 16 counts for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked in a hate crime.
“Sooo…...I'm recused, but when people accuse us of overcharging cases...16 counts on a class 4 (felony) becomes exhibit A,” Foxx texted Magats, according to documents released on Tuesday.
She also compared the case against Smollett, 36, to her office's sexual abuse case against embattled R&B singer R. Kelly, to whom she referred as a ""pedophile.""
""Pedophile with 4 victims 10 counts. Washed up celeb who lied to cops, 16. On a case eligible for deferred prosecution I think it's indicative of something we should be looking at generally,"" Foxx wrote. ""Just because we can charge something doesn't mean we should. … it's not who we want to be.""
Foxx's text messages to Magats appear to contradict claims she had completely recused herself from the case after speaking with one of Smollett's relatives at the behest of Tina Tchen, the one-time chief of staff for former first lady Michelle Obama. She said at the time she spoke to Smollett's relative, the actor was still considered by police to be an assault victim.
In a March 27 interview with Chicago ABC station WLS-TV, Foxx said she decided to remove herself from the case a week before Smollett was charged after having discussions with her office's chief ethics officer. She said she told her chief ethics officer, ""I don't want any speculation or concern. I don't even want the appearance that my involvement with this case, having now seen or talked to a family member, would in any way impede this investigation.""
""So, I made the decision in that consultation to say, 'Wall me off,'"" Foxx said at the time.
The Cook County State's Attorney Office released the text messages on Tuesday in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by media outlets including ABC News. The office released 178 pages of text messages and 3,655 pages of emails connected to the case, including communication among staffers and some of their interactions with the media.
Some of the correspondence was redacted due to a court order sealing Smollett's criminal case.
The messages offer a glimpse into the state's attorney's private thoughts on a high-profile case. The newly revealed correspondence between Foxx and her employees raises questions about the role she may have played in the case after her recusal.
Her office declined to comment on the specifics of the case, citing an ongoing review.
""As the case is currently under review, we are not in a position to comment on specificities related to this topic,"" the office said in a statement Tuesday. ""We look forward to the findings of the Cook County Independent Inspector General's Office's review of how we handled this case.""
Foxx faced fierce backlash from the Chicago Police Department and Mayor Rahm Emanuel when her office announced it was dropping criminal charges against Smollett in an effort to focus its resources on violent crimes.
Emanuel said dropping the charges against Smollett ""is without a doubt a whitewash of justice."" And city officials sued the actor for $130,000 last week, seeking reimbursement for funds spent investigating what they called bogus hate crime allegations.
The lawsuit laid out a detailed account of the allegations against Smollett, who told police he was attacked Jan. 29 by two men who shouted homophobic slurs at him, wrapped a noose around his neck and poured an unknown liquid on him. The timeline includes a 41-point, blow-by-blow description, from when Smollett first met the Ola and Abel Osundario -- the brothers who say Smollett paid them to help stage the attack -- in the fall of 2017 until the final allegation that Smollett continued to be in contact with the brothers days after the alleged attack.
A lawyer for Smollett, who portrays a gay musician on Fox's ""Empire,"" said the actor ""vehemently denies"" accusations of making false statements to police and ""will not be intimidated into paying the demanded sum.""

Attorney general orders some asylum seekers to be held without bail,Luke Barr,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 14:02:00 GMT",N/A,"As part of the Trump administration's effort to slow migrants from crossing the southern border, Attorney General William Barr has ordered that some of those claiming asylum should be denied bail, meaning they could be stuck behind bars for years, rather than days.
Under previous policy, those who seek asylum were granted a bail hearing if they claimed ""credible fear"" threats or threats of persecution in their home country while waiting for their cases to be heard.
Immigration advocates expressed shock at Barr's action and promised to challenge it immediately in court. The decision, which doesn't go into effect for 90 days, orders immigration judges to deny some asylum seekers from posting bail.
Barr's instruction to immigration judges, whom the attorney general oversees and are not part of the judicial branch, comes out of a case involving an Indian man who was picked up ""50 miles"" away from the southern border in Mexico and claimed asylum. Barr says in similar cases bail can be withheld.
""The question here is whether, under [immigration law], aliens transferred after establishing a credible fear are eligible for release on bond,"" he continued.
""I reverse the order granting bond to the respondent,"" Barr wrote in his decision, stating that unless the Department of Homeland Security grants parole under a special exception, under the applicable legal provisions ""he must be detained until his removal proceedings conclude.""
According to Barr's opinion, the person seeking asylum could ask for bond, but it is entirely up to DHS. The order doesn't affect unaccompanied minors along the southern border, ether.
""There is no way to apply those provisions except as they were written—unless paroled, an alien must be detained until his asylum claim is adjudicated,"" Barr wrote.
In Washington state earlier month, a federal judge agreed with the policy that those with ""bona fide"" asylum claims to have a bail hearing within seven days to determine if they can be released on bond while they wait for their court proceedings.
The adjudication of asylum claims could take months or years - given the backlog of cases and lack of immigration judges. In its latest budget request, the Justice Department has requested funds to hire more judges.
The ACLU said it will sue.
""This is the Trump administration’s latest assault on people fleeing persecution and seeking refuge in the United States. Our Constitution does not allow the government to lock up asylum seekers without basic due process. We'll see the administration in court,"" Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement.
President Donald Trump has pushed to end the policy of ""catch and release.""
""Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away,"" the president tweeted in November 2018.
This is just the latest step that the Trump administration has taken to combat what Trump calls a crisis on the southern border.
In May 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions enacted a zero-tolerance policy which lead to the separation of families along the border.
Sessions at the time, said that the policy was a ""deterrent"" for those who attempt to cross the southern border.
The president ended the policy months later in the face of widespread criticism."
Fort Carson soldier who disappeared Monday night found alive,Morgan Winsor,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 10:56:00 GMT",N/A,"A Fort Carson soldier, missing since Monday night, has been found alive and in good condition after a 24-hour search, the U.S. Army announced on Wednesday.
The soldier, whose name has not been released, was last seen on foot around 9:45 p.m. local time on Monday at the Army post's land navigation site near Pueblo West, while participating in the Expert Field Medical Badge competition, according to Fort Carson spokesperson Lt. Col. Christina Kretchman.
Search-and-rescue teams on the ground scoured the area where the soldier was last seen, while helicopters searched from above.
The soldier was located on the west side of the installation on Wednesday morning by a passing motorist on U.S. Highway 115 and was then transported by emergency personnel to a local hospital, according to a press release from Fort Carson.
""The Soldiers of our brigade are tremendously relieved that our Soldier has been recovered safely,"" Col. Dave Zinn, commander of 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, said in a statement Wednesday. ""The Soldier has displayed physical and mental toughness as a Soldier and persevered through a challenging situation. I want to extend my deepest appreciation to all of the Soldiers of Fort Carson, along with the Colorado Springs community, for their diligent work while searching for and bringing our Soldier home.""
Last July, two Army ROTC cadets were rescued after spending a night missing from a land navigation exercise in Hawaii, according to Honolulu's Star Advertiser.
A few weeks earlier, in June, an Alabama Army Reserve soldier was found dead in a wooded area of Camp Blanding in Florida, after he went missing during a similar exercise. Spc. Calyn McLemore's body was found two days after the training course began. Officials said that extreme heat and tough conditions could have been a factor in his disappearance and death, according to the Alabama Media Group."
US disrupted Russian trolls on day of November election: report,N/A,"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"The US military disrupted the internet access of a Russian troll farm accused of trying to influence American voters on November 6, 2018, the day of the congressional elections, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday.
The US Cyber Command strike targeted the Internet Research Agency in the Russian port city of St Petersburg, the Post reported, citing unidentified US officials.
The group is a Kremlin-backed outfit whose employees had posed as Americans and spread disinformation online in an attempt to also influence the 2016 election, according to US officials.
""They basically took the IRA (Internet Research Agency) offline,"" the Post quoted one person familiar with the matter as saying. ""They shut 'em down.""
Cyber Command had no immediate comment on the report.
Earlier this month, a US federal probe found that reported foreign meddling and hacking attempts had ""no material impact"" on the midterm congressional elections last year.
The Internet Research Agency was one of three entities and 13 Russian individuals indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office in February 2018 in an alleged criminal and espionage conspiracy to tamper in the US presidential race, boost Donald Trump and disparage his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.
Prosecutors said the agency is controlled by Russian businessman Evgeny Prigozhin, who US officials have said has extensive ties to Russia's military and political establishment.
Prigozhin, also personally charged by Mueller, has been dubbed ""Putin's cook"" by Russian media because his catering business has organised banquets for Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Democrats seek to make Mueller report public
Meanwhile, on Tuesday, a Democratic politician in the US House of Representatives filed legislation that would require Special Counsel Mueller's Russia report to be made public and give Congress access to the investigation's underlying evidence.
The legislation represents the latest effort by House Democrats to prevent any effort by the Trump administration to keep under wraps the findings of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any involvement by Trump's election campaign.
""This legislation safeguards ... taxpayer-funded law enforcement work and assures the right of Americans to see justice served,"" the Democrat, Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas, said in a statement."
Trump-Kim summit 2.0: What you need to know,Faras Ghani,"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"Hanoi, Vietnam - Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un are due to meet in Hanoi, Vietnam, this week, more than eight months after their landmark first summit in Singapore.
Heading into the talks on Wednesday and Thursday, officials from both the United States and North Korea have not disclosed details about the focus of the meetings.
In an apparent bid to manage expectations, the US president in recent days has said he is in ""no rush"" to achieve denuclearisation, seeking, instead, a continuation of Pyongyang's pause on weapons testing.
On the North Korean side, an end to punishing international sanctions, along with a formal declaration that the 1950-1953 Korean War is over, are likely to be high on the priority list.
On the eve of the talks, Al Jazeera takes a look at what's on the table in the US-North Korea summit 2.0.
How did we get here?
In June last year, Singapore hosted the first meeting between a US president and a North Korean leader.
The historic summit, which came after months of growing tensions marked by nuclear and missile tests, fresh sanctions and threats of ""total destruction"", ended with a vague statement that has failed to produce tangible progress.
In Singapore, Kim and Trump outlined four commitments: establishing ""new relations"" for peace and prosperity; building a ""lasting a stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula""; working ""towards denuclearisation""; and recovering and repatriating the remains of soldiers killed during the Korean War.
However, the agreement did not explicitly define denuclearisation - leading to disagreements over what it means - nor did it detail a specific timeline for the destruction of North Korea's nuclear weapons arsenal.
What does the US want?
As Trump has made clear, the US is seeking an assurance from North Korea that it will stop testing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
It also wants Pyongyang to get rid of all its weapons for its mass destruction programmes, as well as produce a roadmap and concrete plan of action on how it sets about achieving that goal.
A recent report by Stanford University's Centre for International Security and Cooperation said North Korea appears to have produced enough bomb fuel in the past year to add as many as seven nuclear weapons to its arsenal.
Stephen Biegun, Trump's special envoy for North Korea, has reportedly said that a ""dozen"" items on the agenda have been discussed during his recent trips to Pyongyang.
""The two sides may discuss denuclearisation but I'm predicting that Trump wants negotiations with North Korea to be a win domestically so he will shy away from concrete dates and expectations when it comes to the nuclear issue,"" Ben Young, a North Korea analyst and historian, told Al Jazeera.
""I think they will try to nail down a peace treaty of some sort. That is a win-win for both sides,"" he added.
While some US politicians and analysts have speculated that Trump might agree to reduce the US military presence in South Korea - which totals around 28,500 soldiers - officials in Seoul and Washington have said troop levels are not up for negotiation.
""Patience with North Korea is not the worst option. Pressure on Pyongyang and forcing them into a corner with concrete dates in the very near future for denuclearisation may make North Korea feel bullied and subservient,"" said Young.
""North Korea is fiercely prideful and takes it national dignity seriously. The last thing the Trump administration wants is a return to the days of 'fire and fury'.""
What does North Korea want?
Apart from the easing of sanctions and a declaration formally ending the Korean War, North Korea is also calling for the relaunching of some inter-Korean economic projects and the opening of a US liaison office in Pyongyang, according to Biegun.
Hit by food shortages and burdened by US-led international sanctions over its nuclear programme, which have cut it off from most global trade, North Korea last year shifted its focus to economic development.
Kab-Woo Ko, a political science professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said Pyongyang ""needs to secure economic, political and diplomatic benefits from this summit"".
In case an agreement to officially end the Korean War is reached in Hanoi, Ko said a close watch should be kept on which of the sides would eventually sign such a declaration.
""It will be interesting to watch whether the deal is made between US and North Korea only, or if it will include China,"" he said.
The two Koreas are technically still at war as the hostilities stopped in 1953 with a truce signed by the US, representing United Nations forces, and the militaries of North Korea and China.
The armistice agreement - adhered to but not signed by South Korea, whose leaders at the time rejected the idea of a ceasefire that left the peninsula divided - fell short of a peace treaty that has governed the conflict ever since.
On Monday, a presidential spokesperson in Seoul said an end-of-war statement by just two parties - Pyongyang and Washington - would be enough, adding that the focus should be on leading ""North Korea to denuclearisation smoothly through the declaration"".
""The South Korean government welcomes any form of end-of-war agreement if it plays a role to speed up denuclearisation.""
What is the view in Seoul?
The talks in Hanoi follow a thaw in relations between North and South Korea last year, which saw Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in meeting three times.
During those summits, the two leaders agreed to a series of goodwill gestures, vowing to resume economic collaboration when possible and take steps to reduce military threats.
Just like Pyongyang, the inter-Korean economic projects are also sought after by Seoul, including the relaunch of operations at the jointly run Kaesong Industrial Park, which has been suspended for three years.
Located just inside North Korea across the demilitarised zone, the complex was launched in 2004 with the idea of South Korean companies manufacturing their products using North Korean labour, helping it improve its economy.
To win some of those concessions from Washington, North Korea could follow through on shutting its main Yongbyon nuclear complex, as well as abolishing key missile facilities in the presence of foreign experts, South Korean officials have said.
""Moon has invested a lot of political and emotional capital in improving relations with the North,"" Young said.
""The South Korean economy is having some issues at the moment so Moon could use improved North Korea-US relations as a mobilising force for improved domestic approval ratings.""
What is the likely outcome of the talks?
Analysts do not anticipate the Hanoi summit to end with a deal that will see North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons, but have urged Washington to be open to taking interim steps for any agreement to be possible.
Despite hopes for a major breakthrough being slim, there are some expectations the talks could produce a declaration formally ending the Korean War.
For his part, Ko said he wanted to see North Korea ""agree on a process to dismantle Yongbyon nuclear facility"".
That facility, according to Jeffrey Lewis, a scholar at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, is functional.
""It's really business-as-usual at Yongbyon at the moment,"" said Lewis. ""People show up for work, and material comes in, and it looks pretty much like it's looked for the last 10 or 15 years.""
Ko predicted that the talks in Hanoi would see the US give North Korea some benefits that it needed on the political, military and economic fronts, but warned against walking away from Hanoi in the same ""hollow"" manner as the Singapore summit.
""The talk in Singapore was like 'Sanggyeonnye' in Korea - the first meeting between families of the bridge [bride] and the groom.""
""Now, it's time for the real plan.""

"Turkey eyes US sanctions waivers on Iran oil, Russia arms",N/A,"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"Turkey ""expects"" the Trump administration to grant it waivers from the US related to its purchases of Iranian oil and Russian air defences, a top aide to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday.
Presidential spokesman and senior adviser Ibrahim Kalin told a news conference he could not be certain that the waivers would be granted. But, he said Turkey had made a strong case that should be heeded.
Turkey is seeking an extension to a waiver that allows it to import Iranian oil without US penalties that were re-imposed in November after President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The waiver expires early next month.
""We are expecting an extension for Turkey,"" Kalin said. ""We have made it clear we would like to continue to buy Iranian oil. People should not expect Turkey to turn its back on Iran just like that.""
Turkey did not support US sanctions policy on Iran and did not think it would yield the desired result, Kalin said.
The administration granted waivers to eight countries, including Turkey, allowing them to continue to buy Iranian crude provided they pledged to move to cut their imports to zero. Those waivers expire on May 2.
US officials have said that three of the eight waivers won't require extensions because they have eliminated Iranian oil imports. But they have refused to say whether any of the other five will be extended. The lack of clarity has angered Iran hawks in Congress and elsewhere who say that any waiver extensions will hurt the administration's ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Iran to press it to end what the US terms its ""malign activities"" in the Middle East and beyond.
Sources close to the matter told Reuters News Agency in March that Washington is likely to renew waivers for at least three buyers of Iranian oil and Turkey was one of them, along with China and India.
Kalin said Turkey would not want to violate sanctions if a waiver were not extended.
""We will look for alternatives in terms of transactions and other things. We don't want to break or violate the sanctions but at the same time we don't want to be deprived of our right to buy oil and gas from Iran,"" he said.
Russia's S-400 missile defence system
Kalin also said Turkey wants a waiver for sanctions that will likely be triggered should it take delivery of Russia's advanced S-400 missile defence system over Washington's objections.
Turkey's purchase of the S-400 has created a deep rift between the NATO allies, with US officials warning of significant consequences if it is finalised and Turkish officials saying it is a done deal that will not be cancelled.
Kalin said Erdogan and other Turkish officials have been pressing Trump to use a presidential exemption to spare Turkey from sanctions under legislation known as the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which is aimed in part at Russia's defence industry. The exemption allows Trump to bypass the mandated sanctions should he determine it is in US national security interests to do so.
""If it comes to it, of course, we would expect President Trump to use his waiver,"" Kalin said. He stressed that he could not speak for Trump or other US officials but said that Trump had promised Erdogan that he would personally look into the situation. Kalin said he expected delivery of the S-400 system to be completed within two to three months.
In addition to the sanctions, the Pentagon and State Department have said the S-400 purchase will jeopardise Turkey's participation in the US F-35 fighter aircraft programme.
Kalin said Turkey was hopeful the US would agree to a Turkish proposal to set up a technical committee to review possible security threats posed by the S-400.
Kalin spoke to reporters at the Turkish embassy as he wrapped up a trip to Washington, DC, with other senior officials in Erdogan's government, including the ministers of defence, finance and trade.
In addition to their meetings with US officials including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, the officials all spoke at the American-Turkish Council's annual conference on US-Turkey relations. The conference was held at the Trump International Hotel."
US senators want report on Khashoggi killing from intel community,William Roberts,"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"Washington, DC - In a new bid to force the government in the United States to release information about the killing of US-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a group of US senators introduced legislation on Tuesday that would require the Director of National Intelligence to submit a public report on the assassination.
Khashoggi, who was a columnist for the Washington Post and known for his critical writings on Saudi Arabia, was killed shortly after entering the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey on October 2, 2018.
After an initial denial, the Saudi kingdom confirmed that Khashoggi was killed by 15 Saudi agents, but attempted to distance its leadership from the murder.
A United Nations human rights investigation found evidence that Khashoggi's killing was premeditated.
The CIA has reportedly concluded that MBS ordered the murder, an allegation the kingdom denies.
US President Donald Trump has been accused of helping the Saudi government cover up Khashoggi's killing, first by calling it a ""rogue"" operation - a word echoed by Saudi officials, including most recently by Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denied the allegation, telling reporters earlier this month, ""America is not covering up for a murder"".
Pompeo's comments came after a group of bipartisan senators invoked the Magnitsky Act on October 10 giving the Trump administration 120 days to report back their findings on whether they believed the government had a helping hand in committing human rights violations.
Trump did not meet his legally mandated deadline on February 9. Pompeo reportedly sent a letter to Congress on that day, but several senators have said the letter did not satisfy the requirements of the Magnitsky Act.
'The American people have a right to know'
Seeking more information, Senators Ron Wyden, Martin Heinrich, Jack Reed, Chris Coons, and Kamala Harris, introduced legislation on Tuesday calling for a public report on the killing.
""I and other believe that the American people have a right to know what this administration knows about this horrendous and gruesome killing,"" Senator Ron Wyden, lead sponsor of the bill and senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Al Jazeera.
""Among the intelligence committees, I am not going to get into anything classified, but you are talking about open source materials, a prominent journalist murdered in a gruesome way,"" Wyden said.
""As you know, the Senate voted in a way that suggest that"" MBS was involved, Wyden added.
In December, the US Senate voted unanimously on a nonbinding resolution that blamed to the Saudi crown prince.
""For all practical purposes, the Senate is already on record saying what we thought happened,"" Wyden said.
The proposed resolution would require the Director of National Intelligence to submit to Congress a report on the death of Khashoggi within 30 days after the bill is enacted.
""Such report shall include identification of those who carried out, participated in, ordered, or were otherwise complicit in or responsible for the death of Jamal Khashoggi,"" the bill states.
Bypassing Trump
Ahmed Bedier, president of United Voices of America and founder of the Justice for Jamal campaign, welcomed the bill.
""[The bill] sends a message to the White House that the Senate is not going to let this matter go,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""And they're not going to tolerate some kind of cover-up,"" he added.
""They are using the tools they have to demand oversight and bypass the White House and go to the director of intelligence to demand a report.""
Bedier said the move would allow senators to get a comprehensive report, which would include CIA, FBI, NSA and other intelligence findings.
While the majority of senators who pushed for the legislation are Democrats, the Senate has previously shown bipartisan support in the Khashoggi case in demanding answers from the US government over his killing.
""The timing is significant, [Jared] Kushner is preparing to meet Mohammed bin Salman in the Middle East,"" Bedier said. ""They are bringing the issue back to the fore, this will continue to [place] a dark cloud over Mohammed bin Salman that this issue is not going away,"" he added. ""I think the senators also have this in mind.""
Last year, the Khashoggi killing proved to be a tipping point for several politicians, who had long voiced frustration over US support for the Saudi-UAE war in Yemen.
Earlier this month, the House of Representative passed a resolution to end US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The measure was seen as a strong rebuke to Trump."
US House votes to block Trump's border emergency declaration,N/A,"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"The US House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to revoke Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency to build a wall on the US border with Mexico, handing the president a stinging rebuke on his signature issue.
In a 245-182 vote, the Democratic-majority House rejected Trump's assertion that he could use money for the wall that Congress had appropriated for other purposes. The bill now moves to the Republican-run Senate, where it also could pass, given some Republicans' concerns about the president's actions.
If approved in the Senate, Trump has already vowed to veto the measure.
Democratic leaders say the bill is not about the merits of Trump's wall, but how the president is trampling on the Constitution by grabbing money that he can't obtain through normal means.
Trump declared a national emergency on the southern border earlier this month after Democrats refused to give him more than $5bn in funds for the wall. Instead, Congress passed a spending measure that included nearly $1.4bn to build 55 miles (89km) of border barriers in Texas's Rio Grande Valley, ending a dispute that had led to a record 35-day partial shutdown of the government. The spending measure does not include money for a concrete wall, however.
'Steals billions'
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump's emergency ""steals billions of dollars"" from military construction projects - including possibly family housing and child care centres - to build the wall with Mexico.
Republicans counter that problems with drug runners and human trafficking give merit to Trump's manoeuvre.
The president took to Twitter on Monday to urge Senate Republicans to stick with him.
""I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,"" Trump wrote. ""Without strong Borders, we don't have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don't fall into the Democrats 'trap' of Open Borders and Crime!""
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump is trying to ""bend the law"" with his declaration of a national emergency on the southern border. He called on politicians to ""speak up with one bipartisan voice"" to put a check on the executive branch as the founding founders envisioned.
""What would stop a future president from claiming an emergency every week?"" he asked.
But Republican Senator John Kennedy, parrying those claims, said that he would ""expect the next president, whether Democrat or not, would have a staff smart enough to know about the National Emergencies Act, and if the president wants to use it, he or she is going to use it no matter what past presidents have done"".

On Monday, Republican Senator Thom Tillis said he would vote to block the order, joining Maine's Susan Collins and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski as Republicans supporting the resolution. Tillis added that Congress must defend its power of the purse and warned that a future Democratic president might abuse the power to advance ""radical policies"".
Another Republican, Senator Lamar Alexander, called Trump's order ""unnecessary, unwise, and inconsistent with the United States Constitution and I'll decide how to vote when I'm presented with something to vote on"".
Republican Senator Roy Blunt said there is ""no disagreement there is a problem at the border that we are not dealing with adequately"".
He added, ""There is a vigorous discussion about whether the emergency actions really fall into a category where you would define something that had been out there for a long time and Congress had already voted on.""
Senate voting on Trump's emergency order could drag under a rarely used procedure, which an aide said is possibly a first for the chamber. The law allows for up to 15 days of committee review - in this case, at the Armed Services panel - with a full Senate vote three days later. Senators, though, said the process could be expedited.
To override a presidential veto, Democrats would need 16 more Republican senators to join them, an unlikely event, giving Trump the upper hand.
""I don't think it will get here. It won't be overridden in the House,"" Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told reporters.
The wall was one of Trump's top campaign promises. He has long since dropped any pretence that money for the wall would come from Mexico, which he once claimed would be the source of funding.
Trump's declaration of a national emergency gives him access to about $3.6bn in funding for military construction projects to divert to border fencing. The Defense Department has not identified which projects may get cut.
But the administration is more likely to tap $600m from a federal asset forfeiture fund first. In addition, it is considering shifting more than $2bn from Defense Department accounts into a Pentagon counter-drug fund to be tapped for wall construction.
Trump's edict is also being challenged in the federal courts, where a host of Democratic-led states such as California have sued to overturn the order. Rights groups and landowners have also sued over the order.

Trump says strongly considering NATO privileges for Brazil,N/A,"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"US President Donald Trump and Brazil's new far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro forged a bond over their shared brand of conservative and populist politics on Tuesday, with Trump pledging to give more US support to Brazil's global ambitions.
Speaking at a joint White House news conference Trump said: ""As I told President Bolsonaro, I also intend to designate Brazil as a major non-NATO ally - or, maybe a NATO ally. I'll have to talk to a lot of people but maybe a NATO ally - which will greatly advance security and cooperation between our countries.""
Brazil has pursued a closer relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), to make buying US weapons easier and to lower barriers to military and other cooperation with the US.
At the outset of their first meeting, the two populist presidents exchanged football jerseys from their national teams, with Trump's name emblazoned on Brazil's famous yellow shirt and Bolsonaro's on the USA uniform.
Bolsonaro, a former army captain who styled his 2018 campaign on Trump's 2016 run, has declared himself an unabashed admirer of the US president and his politics and the American way of life.
Despite the friendly rhetoric, no major breakthroughs were expected from the White House meeting.
In 2018, Colombia became the only Latin American nation to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as a ""global partner"", which means it will not necessarily have to take part in military action.
Trump also said he supported Brazil's efforts to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a club of the world's advanced economies.
Brazil, the world's eighth-largest economy, applied in 2017 to join the OECD, which has around three dozen members including Latin American countries Mexico, Chile and Colombia.
US-Brazil trade
Trump said he and Bolsonaro would also discuss improving trade between the two largest economies in the Western Hemisphere.
""Brazil makes great product and we make great product, and our trade has been never as good as it should be in the past. And in some cases it should be far, far more,"" Trump said.
China long ago surpassed the United States as Brazil's biggest trading partner and Bolsonaro's economy minister on Monday urged the US to open its market more to Brazil if it wanted to change the status quo.
Before Tuesday's Oval Office meeting, Bolsonaro waived a visa requirement for US visitors to Brazil and later in a Fox News interview on Monday night threw his weight behind Trump's immigration agenda, which includes a wall on the Mexican border.
""We do agree with President Trump's decision or proposal on the wall,"" Bolsonaro said, in remarks translated to English by the broadcaster. ""The vast majority of potential immigrants do not have good intentions. They do not intend to do the best or do good to the US people.""
Trump said that he and Bolsonaro will have a ""fantastic working relationship"" and that ""we have many views that are similar"".
Joint pressure on Maduro
Trump warned on Tuesday that the US could impose ""a lot tougher"" sanctions on Venezuela as he urged the country's military to depose leftist leader Nicolas Maduro.
Bolsonaro echoed his calls for an end to the Maduro regime in Venezuela and an opening of the Venezuelan border with Brazil to allow humanitarian aid in.
""We call on members of Venezuelan military to end their support for Maduro who is really nothing more than a Cuban puppet and finally set their people free,"" Trump said.
Trump called on Venezuelan authorities to allow US humanitarian aid to flow across the border from Brazil.
Bolsonaro said ""re-establishing democracy in Venezuela is a shared interest"" with the US.
The two declined to discuss publicly any potential deployment of US troops to Brazil but Trump said, ""all options are open. All options are a possibility"".
Separately, the US announced on Tuesday new sanctions against Venezuela's state-run mining company Minerven and its president, Adrian Perdomo, in a bid to further cut off funding to the government."
US Supreme Court takes up sentencing appeal in 'DC Sniper' case,N/A,"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"The US Supreme Court has agreed to consider whether a man serving life in prison over his role in a deadly 2002 shooting spree should be re-sentenced because he was only 17 years old when he took part in the Washington-area killings.
Judges said on Monday they will take up an appeal filed by the state of Virginia objecting to a lower court's decision that ordered Lee Boyd Malvo's sentence of life in prison without parole in the so-called ""DC Sniper"" crimes be thrown out.
If Malvo wins, he and others in cases involving certain crimes committed by minors could receive more lenient sentences.
Along with older accomplice, John Allen Muhammad, Malvo shot dead 10 people over three weeks in Washington, Maryland and Virginia.
Muhammad was convicted and later executed in 2009, at age 48, in a Virginia state prison.
Malvo, now 34, received four life sentences in Virginia, where he was convicted of two murders and later entered a separate guilty plea to avoid the death penalty. He also received a sentence of life in prison without parole in Maryland.
The US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled last year that he should be re-sentenced.
The appeals court said Malvo's life-without-parole sentences were legal when they were imposed.
But it said Supreme Court decisions since the shooting spree had found mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles were unconstitutional, and found this rule applied retroactively.
The appeals court said a resentencing would determine whether Malvo qualifies as ""one of the rare juvenile offenders"" who can be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole because his ""crimes reflect permanent incorrigibility"".
Instead, if his crimes ""reflect the transient immaturity of youth"", the court said he's entitled to a sentence short of life without parole.
The Supreme Court will review that decision.
As is typical, the justices did not make any comment in agreeing to hear the case.
The top court will decide the case in its next term, which begins in October and ends in June 2020."
Six US states reeling as rivers rise to record levels,N/A,"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"Record river flooding is now affecting six US states across the central Great Plains and the Midwest.
Last week's major storm that crossed much of the central and eastern part of the country kicked off the flooding when it brought heavy rain along with warmer air, which triggered a widespread snowmelt.
As of Sunday, 40 locations have reported new record-high river levels across the states of Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
Hundreds of people were forced to evacuate their homes as rivers have overflowed banks and several levees failed.
""Major to historic river flooding is expected to continue across parts of the Missouri and Mississippi River Basins due to rapid snowmelt the past few days,"" the US National Weather Service said.
""Flood warnings and advisories remain in effect, mainly across eastern Nebraska and into parts of Iowa.""
In Nebraska, at least two people died due in the floods and another two are missing.
While some upstream rivers have begun to recede, rivers downstream are expected to rise further, with some reaching major- or record-flood stage later this week.
At its highest point, the Missouri River was expected to crest at around 14.5 metres, beating its 2011 record by more than 30cm.
More rain
Beginning Tuesday, there is rain forecast for the mid-Mississippi valley which could further aggravate the flooding situation. The rain is not expected to be heavy, but the soil is already saturated and rainwaters will drain into swollen rivers.
Later in the week, skies will clear, but warmer weather that will melt more of the snow across the northern Plains and Great Lakes, helping to keep rivers and stream elevated through next week.
As spring continues to unfold in the coming weeks, more flooding events like this could be seen across the region.
There is still over half a metre of snow on the ground across some of the northern tier states, which will take time to melt. This stored water along with more spring storms will likely keep much of the low-lying Plains and Midwest states flooded for many more weeks."
A summary of attacks on Muslims in Western countries,N/A,"Sat, 16 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"The killing of at least 49 Muslim worshippers at two mosques on Friday in New Zealand was the latest in a series of attacks against Muslims in western countries - and by far the worst.
Researchers have documented a surge in anti-Muslim attacks in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, among other countries, noting an all-time high in recent years.
Here are some of the most deadly:
US - August 2016: A New York imam and his associate are shot and killed on a busy street near their mosque in Queens. Police say it was a hate crime. The attacker is arrested and charged with murder.
Switzerland - December 2016: A 30-year-old man enters a mosque in central Zurich and starts firing at a handful of men who were drinking tea after evening prayer. Three are wounded.
Another victim was killed by the same perpetrator earlier in the day. The suspect escapes but is found dead near a river close to the mosque.
Canada - January 2017: Alexandre Bissonnette, 27, kills six Muslim worshippers and injures scores of others in an attack at a Quebec City mosque during evening prayers.
The fatalities include one victim who was killed as he attempted to tackle the gunman. Nineteen others are injured in the shooting. Bissonnette is sentenced to life imprisonment.
US - May 2017: Two men are stabbed to death after they try to intervene when a man starts yelling racial slurs at two women of Muslim appearance on a train in the north-western US state of Oregon.
The attacker is identified as 35-year-old Jeremy Joseph Christian. A third man is seriously injured.
UK - June 2017: A 48-year-old man in London drives a van into a group of worshippers who had just come out of a mosque after a late-night prayer, killing a 51-year-old man and injuring nine others.
The driver, 48-year-old Darren Osborne, allegedly shouted ""I want to kill all Muslims - I did my bit"" after the attack. Osborne is sentenced to 43 years in jail on terrorism-related charges.
Spain - August 2017: The number of crimes directed towards Muslims in Spain increases following deadly attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils as mosques in the cities of Granada, Fuenlabrada, Logrono and Seville are desecrated and firebombed.
Three Moroccans are brutally assaulted in Navarre, while a Muslim woman is injured from in attack in front of a Madrid metro.
New Zealand - March 2019: Twenty eight-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant allegedly kills 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch. He is arrested and is facing charges."
Trump overrules House with veto over US border wall,N/A,"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"United States President Donald Trump has issued the first veto of his presidency, overruling the US Congress to protect his emergency declaration for border wall funding.
Flanked by law enforcement officials and by the parents of children who were killed by people in the country without documentation, Trump on Friday maintained that he was not through fighting for his signature campaign promise, which stands largely unfulfilled 18 months before voters decide whether to grant him another term.
""Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution,"" Trump said, ""and I have the duty to veto it.""
A dozen defecting Republicans joined Senate Democrats in approving the joint resolution on Thursday, which capped a week of confrontation with the White House as both parties in Congress strained to exert their power in new ways.
On Thursday, Trump tweeted ""VETO!"", following the Senate vote.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 14, 2019
It is unlikely that Congress will have the two-thirds majority required to override Trump's veto, though House Democrats have suggested they would try nonetheless.
After Trump signed the expected veto, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the body planned to vote for a veto on March 26 and potentially override Trump's move.
Trump's wall
The president wants to use the emergency order to divert billions of federal dollars earmarked for defence spending towards the wall along the southern border with Mexico.
His plan still faces several legal challenges from Democratic state attorneys general and environmental groups that argue the emergency declaration was unconstitutional.
Those cases could block Trump from diverting extra money to barrier construction for months or longer.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which filed one of the cases, said the veto was meaningless - like the declaration in the first place.
""Congress has rejected the president's declaration, and now the courts will be the ultimate arbiter of its legality,"" said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. ""We look forward to seeing him in court and to the shellacking that he will receive at the hands of an independent judiciary.""
Trump said the situation on the southern border was ""a tremendous national emergency"", adding that ""our immigration system is stretched beyond the breaking point"".
Trump is expected to issue his second veto in the coming weeks over a congressional resolution seeking to end US backing for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.
The resolution was approved in the aftermath of the killing of US-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018."
Mueller report to be released on Thursday: What you won't see,N/A,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"US Attorney General William Barr plans to release a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the inquiry into Russia's role in the 2016 US election on Thursday - the keyword being ""redacted"".
The Democrats' demands for a full, unredacted version of Mueller's report are likely to prompt a political and legal battle that could last for months, if not much longer.
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler, has said he is prepared to issue subpoenas ""very quickly"" for the full report on Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign if it is released with blacked-out sections. And that would set the legal fight in motion.
Barr has said he is redacting four types of information from the report.
Congressional Democrats cite precedent from previous investigations in saying they want to see it all. But some Republicans defending Barr are also citing precedent, saying it is appropriate to keep at least some of the information from Congress and the public.
Here's a look at what's likely to be withheld, and why Democrats say the full report should be released.
Grand jury investigation
Barr has staked out his position on releasing secret grand jury information, saying last week that he would not go to court to request its release. He said Democrats are ""free to go to court"" themselves, and Nadler has said he is ready to do so.
Grand jury information, including witness interviews, is normally off limits but can be obtained in court. Some records were eventually released in the Whitewater investigation into former President Bill Clinton and an investigation into President Richard Nixon before he resigned.
Both of those cases were under somewhat different circumstances, including that the House Judiciary Committee had initiated impeachment proceedings. Federal court rules state that a court may order disclosure ""preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding"".
But Democrats have said they are not interested in impeachment, for now, and are likely to argue in court that they don't need to be in an official impeachment proceeding to receive the materials.
Classified information
Congress frequently receives classified documents and briefings, and Democrats say there is no reason the Mueller report should be any different.
Many Republicans agree, including the top Republican on the intelligence committee, Devin Nunes, who wrote a rare joint letter in March with House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff asking for ""all materials, regardless of form or classification"".
In the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press, Schiff and Nunes also asked for a private briefing from Mueller and his team.
Democrat Schiff has argued that some of that information should be released to the public, as well, citing Mueller indictments that have already revealed granular detail about the Russian effort to influence the 2016 election.
""All of that information at one point was classified, but the decision must have been made the public interest outweighs that. And I think a similar analysis should be undertaken here,"" Schiff said on CNN this month.
Ongoing probes
Barr said he will redact information related to investigations connected to the Mueller probe that is still under way. Those include cases handed off or referred to federal prosecutors in Washington, DC, New York and Virginia.
Democrats have noted that the Justice Department has released such information before, including some related to Mueller's own investigation while it was in progress. Republicans who were in the House majority last year, obtained documents related to the beginnings of the Russia investigation, arguing that officials were biased against then-candidate Trump.
Republicans argued at the time that it was necessary to obtain that information to maintain the integrity of the investigation.
Derogatory information
The Justice Department regularly redacts information about people who were interviewed or scrutinised in investigations but not charged. Barr has said he will black out information from the report ""that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties"".
Asked by Senator Jeanne Shaheen, at a hearing last week if that meant he would redact information to protect the interests of Trump, Barr said it did not. ""No, I'm talking about people in private life, not public officeholders,"" Barr said.
That means that in addition to Trump, members of his family who work at the White House, such as his daughter Ivanka, could potentially be named if they were somehow entangled in Mueller's investigation. But any information regarding his sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr, who run his businesses, could be more likely to be redacted.
The Justice Department did release information about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices more than two years ago, even though Clinton wasn't charged. But that was after then-FBI Director James Comey made the much-questioned decision to publicly discuss that investigation. Barr signalled in his confirmation hearing in January that he would do things differently.
""If you're not going to indict someone, then you don't stand up there and unload negative information about the person,"" Barr said. ""That's not the way the Department of Justice does business"""
US allowing lawsuits over properties seized by Castro's Cuba,N/A,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"The Trump administration on Wednesday opened the door for lawsuits against foreign firms operating on properties Cuba seized from Americans after the 1959 revolution.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he will not renew a bar on litigation that has been in place for two decades, meaning that lawsuits can be filed starting on May 2 when the current suspension expires.
The major policy shift, which the State Department said could draw hundreds of thousands of legal claims worth tens of billions of dollars, appears intended to intensify pressure on Havana at a time Washington is demanding that it end its support for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The move comes despite opposition from the European Union.
""Any person or company doing business in Cuba should heed this announcement,"" Pompeo said.
Pompeo said the administration was acting because it recognised the ""reality"" that the bar on lawsuits, which has been in place since 1996, had not achieved the goal of pressing Cuba to enact democratic reforms or reining in what he called Cuba's ""export of oppression"" throughout the Western Hemisphere, particularly in Venezuela.
""We see clearly that regime's repression of its own people and unrepentant exportation of tyranny in the region has only gotten worse because dictators perceive appeasement as weakness, not strength,"" he told reporters.
Pompeo's decision gives Americans the legal right to sue companies that operate out of hotels, tobacco factories, distilleries and other properties Cuba nationalised after Fidel Castro took power. It allows lawsuits by Cubans who became United States citizens years after their properties were taken.
""Those citizens' opportunities for justice have been put out of reach for two decades,"" Pompeo said.
There are roughly 6,000 claims that the Justice Department has certified as having merit, according to Kimberly Breier, the top US diplomat for the Americas. Those claims have an estimated value of eight billion dollars: two billion in property and six billion in interest, she said. In addition, there are about 200,000 uncertified claims that could run into the tens of billions of dollars, she said.
No exceptions
Breier said there would be no exceptions to the decision, which has already prompted stern responses from Canada and Europe as they have vowed to protect their businesses from lawsuits. She said the only way companies will be safe from litigation would be to ensure that they are not doing business on expropriated properties.
""European companies that are operating in Cuba will have nothing to worry about if they are not operating on properties taken from Americans,"" she said.
The decision deals a severe blow to Havana's efforts to draw foreign investment to the island and comes as President Donald Trump steps up pressure to isolate embattled Venezuelan President Maduro, who is holding power with help from other countries, including Cuba, China and Russia.
Spain, which has large investments in hotels and other tourism-related industries on the island, was the first to react. A senior government official told The Associated Press that Madrid would ask the EU to challenge the US move through the World Trade Organization.
Businesses from Canada, France and the UK, among other countries, also conduct business in properties nationalised after Castro took power.
'A dose of reality'
National Security Adviser John Bolton is expected to discuss the new policy during a speech in Miami, home to thousands of exiles and immigrants from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. The speech at the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association is to be delivered on the 58th anniversary of the failed US invasion of the island in 1961, an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government.
Johana Tablada, Cuba's deputy director of US affairs, said on Twitter, ""Before they try to euphorically ride a wave of wickedness and lies, they should take a dose of reality. The world has told John Bolton and the US government to eliminate the criminal blockade against Cuba and the Helms-Burton Act.""
The 1996 act gave Americans the right to sue the mostly European companies.
Countries with large investments in Cuba have ferociously protested the law.
""The extraterritorial application of the US embargo is illegal and violates international law,"" said Alberto Navarro, the EU ambassador to Cuba. ""I personally consider it immoral. For 60 years, the only thing that's resulted from the embargo is the suffering of the Cuban people.""
US airlines and cruise lines that carry hundreds of thousands of travellers to Cuba each year appear to be exempt from the key provision of the Helms-Burton Act.
Every US president since Bill Clinton has suspended the key clause to avoid those trade clashes and a potential mass of lawsuits that would prevent any future settlement with Cuba over nationalised properties.
Cuba has said it is willing to reimburse the owners of confiscated properties, but only if the communist government is also reimbursed for billions of dollars in damages generated by the six-decade US trade embargo.
The announcement comes at a moment of severe economic weakness for Cuba, which is struggling to find enough cash to import basic food and other supplies following a drop in aid from Venezuela and a string of bad years in other key economic sectors."
US: Asylum seekers who show credible fear not eligible for bond,N/A,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"Detained asylum seekers in the United States who have shown they have a credible fear of returning to their country will no longer be able to ask a judge to grant them release using bond, according to a ruling by US Attorney General William Barr, who overturned decades-old policy on Tuesday.
Barr struck down a decision that had allowed some asylum seekers to ask for bond in front of an immigration judge, in a ruling that expands indefinite detention for some migrants who must wait months or years for their cases to be heard.
The first immigration court ruling from President Donald Trump's newly appointed attorney general is in keeping with the administration's moves to clamp down on the asylum process as tens of thousands of mostly Central Americans cross into the United States asking for refuge. US immigration courts are overseen by the Justice Department and the attorney general can rule in cases to set a legal precedent.
Barr's ruling is the latest instance of the Trump administration taking a hard line on immigration. This year the administration implemented a policy to return some asylum seekers to Mexico while their cases work their way through backlogged courts, a policy which has been challenged with a lawsuit.
Several top officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were forced out this month over Trump's frustrations with an influx of migrants and asylum seekers at the US southern border.
Barr's decision applies to migrants who crossed between official ports of entry into the US.
Typically, those migrants are placed in ""expedited removal"" proceedings - a faster form of deportation reserved for people who irregularly entered the country within the last two weeks and are detained within 100 miles (160km) of a land border. Migrants who present themselves at ports of entry and ask for asylum are not eligible for bond. But before Barr's ruling, those who had crossed the border between official entry points and asked for asylum were eligible for bond, once they had proven to asylum officers they had a credible fear of persecution.
""I conclude that such aliens remain ineligible for bond, whether they are arriving at the border or are apprehended in the United States,"" Barr wrote.
Barr said such people can be held in immigration detention until their cases conclude, or if DHS decides to release them by granting them ""parole"". DHS has the discretion to parole people who are not eligible for bond and frequently does so due to insufficient detention space or other humanitarian reasons.
The decision doesn't affect asylum-seeking families because they generally can't be held for longer than 20 days. It also doesn't apply to unaccompanied minors.
Barr said he was delaying the effective date by 90 days ""so that DHS may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions"".
'Another way to criminalise migration'
Michael Tan, from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said the rights group intended to sue the Trump administration over the decision, and immigrant advocates decried the decision.
""We'll see the administration in court. Again,"" the ACLU tweeted.""Our Constitution does not allow the government to lock up asylum seekers without basic due process"".
Angelo Guisado, a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights, tweeted, ""Mandating detention for what amounts to seeking asylum at the southern border is another instantiation of criminalizing migration. I find it perverse that we mandate detention (f***ing jail!) for what is at best a civil offense and is more aptly a place-of-birth violation.""
We detain over 440,000 noncitizens each year. FY 2018, Congress approved 40,520 detention beds, though the daily average is closer to 45,000. As of March, ICE had 50,049 people in custody. Trump aims to make it to 60,000, and this abomination of a decision will help get him there https://t.co/jW6Bjc5Hfd
— Angelo Guisado (@VoltaireLaFlare) April 16, 2019
The decision's full impact is not yet clear, because it will in large part depend on the ability of DHS to expand detention, said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas.
""The number of asylum seekers who will remain in potentially indefinite detention pending disposition of their cases will be almost entirely a question of DHS's detention capacity, and not whether the individual circumstances of individual cases warrant release or detention,"" Vladeck said.
DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision. The agency had written in a brief in the case arguing that eliminating bond hearings for the asylum seekers would have ""an immediate and significant impact on ... detention operations.""
In early March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the DHS agency responsible for detaining and deporting immigrants in the country irregularly, said the average daily population of immigrants in detention topped 46,000 for the 2019 fiscal year, the highest level since the agency was created in 2003. Last year, Reuters news agency reported that ICE had modified a tool officers have been using since 2013 when deciding whether an immigrant should be detained or released on bond, making the process more restrictive.
Barr's decision came after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided to review the case in October. Sessions resigned from his position in November, leaving the case to Barr to decide."
Trump vetoes bill to end US involvement in Yemen war,N/A,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"President Donald Trump has vetoed a bill Congress passed to end United States military assistance in the Saudi Arabia-led war in Yemen.
In a break with the president, Congress voted for the first time to invoke the War Powers Resolution to try and stop US involvement in a foreign conflict.
But Trump vetoed the measure on Wednesday with the Congress lacking the votes to override him.
""This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,"" said Trump in a statement.
House approval of the resolution came earlier this month on a 247-175 vote. The Senate vote last month was 54-46.
Al Jazeera's Rosiland Jordan, reporting from Washington DC, said at least two Democratic congressmen were calling to override the veto.
""Members of the Congress are also angry that the Trump administration is continuing with the pattern of never-ending war around the world without getting the express permission of the Congress first.
""The question now, can the Congress figure out how to reverse the veto and have this resolution take effect in a couple of weeks' time,"" she said.
The UAE hails the veto
Congress has grown uneasy with Trump's close relationship with Saudi Arabia as he tries to further isolate Iran, a regional rival.
Many legislators also criticised the president for not condemning Saudi Arabia for the killing of a Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who had been critical of the kingdom.
Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October and never came out. Intelligence agencies said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was complicit in his murder.
Vetoing the measure is an ""effective green light for the war strategy that has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis to continue"", said International Rescue Committee (IRC) president and CEO David Miliband.
""Yemen is at a breaking point with 10 million people on the brink of famine. There are as many as 100 civilian casualties per week, and Yemenis are more likely to be killed at home than in any other structure.""
The US provides billions of dollars of arms to the Saudi-led coalition fighting against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen.
Since 2015, the US has provided the aerial refuelling of jets, reconnaissance, targeting and intelligence information to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), in their campaign against the Houthi rebels who unseated the Saudi-backed government in Yemen.
The UAE has hailed the veto, adding that the decision is both ""timely and strategic"".
""President Trump's assertion of support to the Arab Coalition in Yemen is a positive signal,"" Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter early on Wednesday.
'Humanitarian crisis'
Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Arab governments have launched more than 19,000 air raids across Yemen.
""There are 22 million souls at risk of dying, of being killed. Maybe not of being shot, but being starved to death or dying from medical problems for which they can receive no medicines,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer previously told reporters.

Top GOP leader pauses and gives a ‘spineless’ defense when pressed on Trump’s fake national emergency,Cody Fenwick,"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"At a press conference on Tuesday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was confronted with a simple and straightforward question: Why are President Donald Trump and the Republican Party declaring a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border now, when just a few months ago, when the GOP still controlled Congress, there was apparently no emergency to declare?
Faced with this question, McCarthy paused briefly and looked down at the ground, clearly caught off guard. He then began his desperate answer with a pseudo-profound truism: “Well, times change as it moves forward,” he said.
He continued: “When you get the more report of the drugs coming across, you get the more reports of human trafficking and others. 60,000 people arrested each month. I think when you have the experts telling you the challenge… I think the president tried to do everything in his power to work with the House and the Senate. I think the president’s belief was that we could always come to an agreement to solve this along what the experts have requested. I think at the end of the day the president has a responsibility to make sure it gets protected, and he made the decision.”
Of course, this didn’t really answer the question at all — and it reinforced the obvious fact for that, for Trump, the emergency has nothing to do with the conditions at the border. The “emergency” is that he can’t get what he wants from Congress.
The truth is that the problems McCarthy cites at the border, human trafficking and drug smuggling, mostly occur at ports of entry, and thus would not be stopped by the wall Trump wants to build with funds seized via the emergency declaration. And while unauthorized border crossings were up somewhat after 2017, they are still well below recent peaks — and this explanation still doesn’t show why the GOP didn’t declare a national emergency last year. There’s no new data showing that the situation at the border is spiraling out of control — there’s just a desperate president scrambling to fulfill a ridiculous promise.
“Translation: We’re spineless cowards marching to the orders of Dear Leader, what do you want?” said national security lawyer Bradley Moss of McCarthy’s comments.

Here’s what Republicans and billionaires really mean when they talk about ‘freedom’,Independent Media Institute,"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"America is having a heated debate about the meaning of the word socialism. We’d be better served if, instead, we were debating the meaning of freedom.
The Oregonian reported last week that fully 156,000 families are on the edge of homelessness in our small-population state. Every one of those households is now paying more than 50 percent of its monthly income on rent, and none of them has any savings; one medical bill, major car repair or job loss, and they’re on the streets.
While socialism may or may not solve their problem, the more pressing issue we have is an entire political party and a huge sector of the billionaire class who see homelessness not as a problem, but as a symptom of a “free” society.
The words freedom and liberty are iconic in American culture—probably more so than with any other nation because they’re so intrinsic to the literature, declarations and slogans of our nation’s founding.
The irony—of the nation founded on the world’s greatest known genocide (the systematic state murder of tens of millions of Native Americans) and over three centuries of legalized slavery and a century and a half of oppression and exploitation of the descendants of those slaves—is extraordinary. It presses us all to bring true freedom and liberty to all Americans.
But what do those words mean?
If you ask the Koch brothers and their buddies—who slap those words on pretty much everything they do—you’d get a definition that largely has to do with being “free” from taxation and regulation. And, truth be told, if you’re morbidly rich, that makes a certain amount of sense, particularly if your main goal is to get richer and richer, regardless of your behavior’s impact on working-class people, the environment, or the ability of government to function.
On the other hand, the definition of freedom and liberty that’s been embraced by so-called “democratic socialist” countries—from Canada to almost all of Europe to Japan and Australia—you’d hear a definition that’s closer to that articulated by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he proposed, in January 1944, a “second Bill of Rights” to be added to our Constitution.
FDR’s proposed amendments included the right to a job, and the right to be paid enough to live comfortably; the right to “adequate food and clothing and recreation”; the right to start a business and run it without worrying about “unfair competition and domination by monopolies”; the right “of every family to a decent home”; the right to “adequate medical care… to achieve and enjoy good health”; the right to government-based “protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment”; and the right “to a good education.”
Roosevelt pointed out that, “All of these rights spell security.”
He added, “America’s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.”
The other nations mentioned earlier took President Roosevelt’s advice to heart. Progressive “social democracy” has kept Europe, Canada, and the developed nations of the East and South Pacific free of war for almost a century—a mind-boggling feat when considering the history of the developed world since the 1500s.
Just prior to FDR winning the White House in the election of 1932, the nation had been treated to 12 years of a bizarre Republican administration that was the model for today’s GOP. In 1920, Warren Harding won the presidency on a campaign of “more industry in government, less government in industry”—privatize and deregulate—and a promise to drop the top tax rate of 91 percent down to 25 percent.
He kept both promises, putting the nation into a sugar-high spin called the Roaring ’20s, where the rich got fabulously rich and working-class people were being beaten and murdered by industrialists when they tried to unionize. Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover (the three Republican presidents from 1920 to 1932) all cheered on the assaults, using phrases like “the right to work” to describe a union-free nation.
In the end, the result of the “horses and sparrows” economics advocated by Harding (“feed more oats to the horses and there’ll be more oats in the horse poop to fatten the sparrows”—that generation’s version of trickle-down economics) was the Republican Great Depression (yes, they called it that until after World War II).
Even though Roosevelt was fabulously popular—the only president to be elected four times—the right-wingers of his day were loud and outspoken in their protests of what they called “socialist” programs like Social Security, the right to unionize, and government-guaranteed job programs including the WPA, REA, CCC, and others.
The Klan and American Nazis were assembling by the hundreds of thousands nationwide—nearly 30,000 in Madison Square Garden alone—encouraged by wealthy and powerful “economic royalists” preaching “freedom” and “liberty.” Like the Kochs’ Freedomworks, that generation’s huge and well-funded (principally by the DuPonts’ chemical fortune) organization was the Liberty League.
Roosevelt’s generation had seen the results of this kind of hard-right “freedom” rhetoric in Italy, Spain, Japan and Germany, the very nations with which we were then at war.
Speaking of “the grave dangers of ‘rightist reaction’ in this Nation,” Roosevelt told America in that same speech that: “[I]f history were to repeat itself and we were to return to the so-called ‘normalcy’ of the 1920s—then it is certain that even though we shall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, we shall have yielded to the spirit of Fascism here at home.”
Although right-wingers are still working hard to disassemble FDR’s New Deal—the GOP budget for 2019 contains massive cuts to Social Security, as well as to Medicare and Medicaid—we got halfway toward his notion of freedom and liberty here in the United States:
You’re not free if you’re old and deep in poverty, so we have Social Security (although the GOP wants to gut it).
You’re not free if you’re hungry, so we have food stamps/SNAP (although the GOP wants to gut them).
You’re not free if you’re homeless, so we have housing assistance and homeless shelters (although the GOP fights every effort to help homeless people).
You’re not free if you’re sick and can’t get medical care, so we have Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare (although the GOP wants to gut them all).
You’re not free if you’re working more than 40 hours a week and still can’t meet basic expenses, so we have minimum wage laws and the right to unionize (although the GOP wants to gut both).
You’re not free if you can’t read, so we have free public schools (although the GOP is actively working to gut them).
You’re not free if you can’t vote, so we’ve passed numerous laws to guarantee the right to vote (although the GOP is doing everything it can to keep tens of millions of Americans from voting).
The billionaire class and their wholly owned Republican politicians keep trying to tell us that “freedom” means the government doesn’t provide any of the things listed above.
Instead, they tell us (as Ron Paul famously did in a GOP primary debate years ago) that, if we’re broke and sick, we’re “free” to die like a feral dog in the gutter.
Freedom is homelessness, in the minds of the billionaires who own the GOP.
Poverty, lack of education, no access to health care, poor-paying jobs, and barriers to voting are all proof of a free society, they tell us, which is why America’s lowest life expectancy, highest maternal and childhood death rates, lowest levels of education, and lowest pay are almost all in GOP-controlled states.
America—particularly the Democratic Party—is engaged in a debate right now about the meaning of socialism. It would be a big help for all of us if we were, instead, to have an honest debate about the meaning of the words freedom and liberty.

White nationalists have infiltrated the US military,Ilana Novick,"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"Patrick Casey came to the 2018 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on a mission. Casey, executive director of Identity Evropa, a white nationalist group that was involved in the “Unite The Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, believes diversity is harmful to the United States and aims to create a “white supermajority.” He told NBC in an interview at CPAC that his organization aims “to take over the GOP as much as possible.”
If Identify Evropa hasn’t taken over the GOP as Casey hoped, his organization, HuffPost reports Monday, has made inroads into another key institution: the military. Seven members have been identified as Identity Evropa members, according to HuffPost’s investigation.
HuffPost identified these members through leaked online chat logs from a server on Discord, a chat app popular among alt-right groups, which Identity Evropa members have used to communicate with each other for years. The independent media group Unicorn Riot first published the logs last week.
In its investigation, HuffPost found that “Two Marines, two Army ROTC cadets, an Army physician, a member of the Texas National Guard and one member of the Air Force all belong to … Identity Evropa.”
After Unicorn Riot released the chat logs, another anti-fascist collective, Identify Evropa, reviewed them and used biographical details from the posts, which were written under pseudonyms, to begin to determine their actual identities.
HuffPost then used that research to continue its own, and verified the identities of seven service members. Their messages, HuffPost reporter Christopher Mathias writes, “indicate that they hold deeply racist and anti-Semitic views and participate in Identity Evropa propaganda campaigns, posting stickers and flyers in cities and on college campuses.”
One of the military personnel revealed by HuffPost was Stephen T. Farrea, 29, who, as a military spokesperson confirmed, is a corporal in the Selected Marine Corps Reserve. He posted under the name SuperTomPerry-RI and frequently referenced his Marine Corps position. Among his racist comments were statements including “Portsmouth my town 95 percent white very nice,” and that he was looking forward to posting “It’s OK to be white” flyers.
According to HuffPost, “Last week, he attended an Identity Evropa gathering in Kentucky,” also attended by Jason Laguardia, a lance corporal who posts on Discord under the name Jason-CT. Laguardia often posts “pictures of Identity Evropa flyers and stickers … throughout Connecticut and New York City.”
This revelation isn’t the first indication of concern over the presence and power of white nationalists in the U.S. armed forces.
As Mathias writes:
In February, federal authorities arrested Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Hasson, a white nationalist who prosecutors allege was stockpiling weapons to massacre leftists and reporters in a violent plot to establish a “white homeland.”
Last year, a series of investigative reports by ProPublica and “Frontline” found multiple members of violent neo-Nazi groups among the ranks of the military.
And a 2017 poll conducted by the Military Times found that nearly 25 percent of service members surveyed said they encountered white nationalists within their ranks. That poll found that 30 percent of troops said they saw white nationalism as a bigger threat to national security than the wars in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.
Identity Evropa was founded by an ex-Marine. HuffPost spoke with multiple experts who expressed concern over the impact of white nationalists in the armed forces. Military personnel, active duty and veterans alike, said Kathleen Belew, author of “Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America,” have “played an instrumental role in moving weapons, training and tactics from military to civilian spaces” and, she continued, “dramatically escalated the impact of white power violence on civilian populations.”
Daryle Jenkins, an Air Force veteran and founder of One People’s Project, an anti-racist group, told HuffPost he was concerned about the safety of nonwhite, Christian service members who must serve alongside white nationalists who might, as he explained, “undermine and threaten their fellow soldier[s].”
These revelations come on the heels of concerns over white nationalists in government. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, told The New York Times in January, “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization—how did that language become offensive?” Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., once allegedly described himself as “David Duke without the baggage,” as the Times reported in 2014.
Following the release of the chat logs and HuffPost requests for comment, “The military is determining whether they violated rules regarding discrimination and extremist activity,” Mathias writes. Scalise and King remain in Congress.

House Republicans are trying to stonewall voter suppression investigations,Laura Clawson,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"House Republicans are strongly hinting to state officials that they should stonewall the Oversight Committee’s investigation into voter suppression. A letter signed by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan and other Republicans claims that the investigation raises “serious federalism concerns” and is “partisan.” Rep. Elijah Cummings, the committee chair, responded forcefully, saying that “With a Democratic President, there was no allegation too small to investigate, but now that Donald Trump is in the White House, there is apparently no scandal too big to ignore.”
Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the chair of the civil rights subcommittee carrying out the investigations into voter suppression in Kansas, Texas, and Georgia, likewise pushed back, citing a “solemn duty” to investigate “state-based assaults on popular democracy like the reported purges of hundreds of thousands of voters and the relocation of municipal polling places outside of municipal boundaries.” And that solemn duty is absolutely within the committee’s rights, Raskin said: “It is obviously within our power under the Supremacy Clause and the Bill of Rights to conduct constitutional oversight in order to protect voters’ rights in the states, resistance by partisan state officials notwithstanding.”
This isn’t the first time House Republicans have tried to get the subjects of Democratic investigations to stonewall. They’ve also been sending letters to drug companies suggesting they not comply with information requests on prescription drug prices.
Those Republicans sure do like to stand up for the little guy, taking sides against voters and people struggling to pay for prescription medications."
Conservative apologizes for ignoring a Christian right-wing takeover of the GOP — which led to Trump,N/A,"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 14:59:59 GMT",N/A,
Ex-lawyer for Trump official explains why the president’s allies should be concerned: ‘If they’re breathing easy right now — they’re very foolish’,Matthew Chapman,"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"Last week, speculation abounded that newly appointed Attorney General William Barr was preparing to release special counsel Robert Mueller’s report as soon as this week. That speculation has since been dampened by a Justice Department official confirming that will not happen — but even so, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has suggested Mueller’s full findings will not even be made public.
But even if Mueller’s report does come out soon, and what is released to the public or Congress does not implicate the president or his family in any meaningful way, that is no cause for Trump and his allies to think they are in the clear, a defense lawyer close to the case told POLITICO.
“If anyone in Trump world is breathing easy right now, I’d say they are very foolish,” said Shanlon Wu, who previously defended former Trump campaign deputy chairman Rick Gates. “Even if Mueller’s report were to appear and didn’t implicate the president, all these other criminal investigations will continue. That’s not going to be the magic bullet that solves everything. I’d be very concerned if I was a lawyer or a potential target in that world right now.”
Mueller, who was appointed to take over the FBI’s Russia investigation after Trump tried to interfere with it, has a specific mandate: investigate contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, and prosecute criminal activity that arose from or was uncovered in the course of that investigation. From that probe, Mueller has indicted or convicted over 30 U.S. and Russian individuals and businesses, including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, and former Trump adviser Roger Stone. Consequently, the Mueller probe has attracted most of the public’s attention, and most of Trump’s ire.
But in fact, the Mueller probe is just a small portion of the legal jeopardy surrounding Trump’s presidency. Prosecutors with the Southern District of New York are probing the president’s finances, his inaugural fund, and deals with his former personal attorney Michael Cohen. State officials in New York just shut down Trump’s charitable foundation amid a tax fraud investigation, and other prosecutors are reportedly ready to bring state charges to nullify a potential pardon of Manafort. Sealed indictments in a federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., could potentially bring more charges for Trump associates. Meanwhile, Democrats in the House are preparing round after round of investigations of Trump and his Cabinet, and are sending transcripts to the Justice Department that could show Trump’s allies lied under oath.
The endgame of the Mueller investigation is important. But it is not the end of Trump’s problems."

Evangelical Christianity is facing a political crisis — it will need more than a makeover,Valerie Tarico,"Tue, 08 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"Ok, evangelicals do have a brand problem—but they also have a major product problem.
Bible-believing born-again Christians, aka evangelicals, have had a brand problem since Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority sold the born-again movement to the Republican party in exchange for political power a generation ago, forging the religious right.
The Republican party has been using Christianity’s good name to cover bad deeds ever since, all the while tapping evangelical media empires and churches as communications and organizing platforms to bring ordinary believers along with the merger. Having become true-believers themselves, Evangelical leaders have offered themselves up as trusted messengers for this New-and-Improved political gospel project.
And it has worked.
Born-again Christians haven’t given up their core beliefs: that the Bible is the literally perfect word of God, Jesus died for their sins, and folks who don’t accept this gift will burn forever in Hell. Rather, most white evangelicals (and a number of blacks and Hispanics) have appended parts of the Republican policy agenda and the underlying conceptual framework to this list. Religious beliefs and political beliefs have become, for many evangelicals, indistinguishable objects of devotion, beyond question. Political tribe and religious tribe now have the same boundaries.
When I outlined evangelicalism’s brand problem in early 2016, few of us had any idea how bad it could get. Now the world associates the term Evangelical with the Trump election—over 80 percent of evangelicals gave him their vote—and with the candidacy of theocrat, Roy Moore, who despite credible allegations that he pursued and pawed young teens while an assistant district attorney, received comparable support from white Alabama evangelicals.
In the aftermath of Moore’s campaign and (merciful) defeat, the minority of Evangelical Christians who found him horrifying are doing some public soul searching—well, except not really. Many recognize only the brand problem and are, more than anything, simply scrambling to get away from the term evangelical itself. “After Trump and Moore, some evangelicals are finding their own label too toxic to use,” reports the Washington Post. “The term feels irreversibly tainted,” agrees evangelical author Jen Hatmaker.
Jemar Tisby is president of a faith-based media company catering to black evangelicals, but he says that “It’s counterproductive to identify as evangelical. . . . What’s happened with evangelicalism is, it has become so conflated with Republican politics, that you can’t tell where Christianity ends and partisanship begins.”
At Wheaton College, my old alma mater, the executive director of the Billy Graham Center, Ed Stetzer, said, “I don’t want ‘evangelical’ to mean people who supported candidates with significant and credible accusations against them. If evangelical means that, it has serious ramifications for the work of Christians and churches.”
At Princeton University, the Princeton Evangelical Fellowship renamed itself Princeton Christian Fellowship to get away from the negative associations. But is evangelicalism tainting Christianity itself as a brand? Five years ago, Campus Crusade for Christ–which spends over $500,000,000 annually to recruit and retain evangelical college students–changed its name to the less transparent “Cru.” Mark Galli, editor-in-chief at Christianity Today, wrote of the Moore race, “There is already one loser: Christian faith…No one will believe a word we say, perhaps for a generation. Christianity’s integrity is severely tarnished.”
What even thoughtful evangelical leaders like Galli fail to recognize is that people shouldn’t believe a word they say—not about politics, not about morality, and not even about theology at this point. The problem isn’t skin deep. Their brand problem is a function of their product problem, and as Emmett Price at Gordon-Cornwell Theological Seminary put it, “Ditching a term is simply ditching a term.” Abandoning the term evangelical is the most superficial fix conceivable.
Real soul searching would mean asking what it is about the evangelical worldview that has made evangelical leaders and ordinary Bible-believers susceptible to courtship by authoritarian, bigoted, sexist, tribal, anti-intellectual greedmongers who dangle the carrot of theocracy. But few evangelical leaders are asking this question because that would mean revisiting the peculiar status they grant to the Bible itself. And that is off-limits.
When one treats the Bible as the literally perfect and complete word of God—which most Christian scholars don’t but most evangelicals do—it isn’t hard to find support for every item in the ugly list that now darkens the evangelical brand. The Bible contains some really bad ideas. The opposite is also true, mind you. It also contains support for compassion, love, generosity, inclusion, and humility—and many other virtues that humanity values widely across both secular and religious wisdom traditions. The Bible is morally inchoate. It documents and sanctifies humanity’s moral infancy; and idolizing the book binds believers to the worldview of the Iron Age, leaving them susceptible to justifying all manner of misbehaviors in the name of god.
That is precisely what the Republican operatives of the religious right have done; and as evangelical leaders got sucked into the merger of biblical theology and conservative dogma, that is precisely what they have done; and as they have spread this infectious product to the followers who trust them, that is precisely what they have done too. At the bottom of this shit-flow sequence sit children born into households of true believers who isolated them in homeschooling and church schools, then send them to institutions like Bob Jones or Liberty University or Wheaton so that, identity cemented, they can carry forward the project unquestioned.
So, evangelicals have three enormous and interrelated problems with their product at this point. One is that their whole enterprise is built on an indefensible view of the Bible. This has facilitated the merger of biblical Christianity with Republican dogmas and will leave believers vulnerable to this kind of exploitation until the theology itself is fixed.
The second problem is that millions of Christians have now been so thoroughly indoctrinated into Bible-sanctified Republican ideology that it could take a generation to move them away from the beliefs and priorities that elected Donald Trump and nearly elected Roy Moore. It took a generation to bind them into this tangled web and there is no reason to think that journeying free will be easier.
The third problem is that this whole state of affairs has been a profound violation of trust. People trust religious leaders to be honest and moral, and when that is gone little influence remains. Young people who see through the mess are leaving evangelicalism and Christianity. They are losing faith in faith itself.
This much is clear. Simply swapping in the term Christian for the term evangelical will only damage Christianity’s brand at large, which evangelicals have already done—with help, of course, from the Catholic hierarchy. As a former evangelical Christian, now a spiritual non-theist, I don’t necessarily think of that as a bad thing, but Christians should. Some reformers are attempting real change from within evangelicalism. Tony Campolo, Rachel Held Evans, Rob Bell and John Pavlovitz, to cite a few are fighting hard to save the soul of a faith they cherish. But a path to broad reformation remains unclear."
Here’s how much time Michael Cohen is likely to spend in prison,Alex Henderson,"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"Even when he was getting ready to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, Vietnam, President Donald Trump found time to visit Twitter and attack his former personal attorney Michael Cohen. Trump accused the 52-year-old lawyer, who is testifying publicly before the House Oversight Committee in Washington, D.C. today, of lying in the hope of reducing his three-year prison sentence. Cohen is expected to report to federal prison on May 6, but how much time he will actually serve remains to be seen.
Trump obviously knew that Cohen’s testimony would paint him in an extremely negative light: major media reported that Cohen would be testifying on the ways in which the president is a “racist” and a “con man.” And at roughly 1:08 eastern time, Trump tweeted, “Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crooked’s lawyer!”
Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crooked’s lawyer!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 27, 2019
In federal court, Cohen has pled guilty to a long list of criminal charges. On August 22, 2018, he pled guilty to eight charges, ranging from bank fraud and tax evasion to campaign finance violations. And in November, he also pled guilty to lying to Congress about plans to build a Trump Tower Moscow in Russia—a real estate project that was abandoned.
After that guilty plea, different groups of federal prosecutors—Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team and the Southern District of New York—released separate sentencing memos on December 7. Mueller’s memo described Cohen as a cooperative witness and recommended a more lenient sentence, while Southern District prosecutors viewed him less favorably in their memo. And on December 12 in New York City, U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III sentenced Cohen to three years in federal prison—which doesn’t necessarily mean that he will serve the entire sentence.
There is no parole per se for civilians in the federal prison system in the United States, where parole boards exist at the state level (more than 50 altogether). But there is time off for good behavior—for example, cooperating with federal prosecutors.
In Forbes Magazine, Walter Pavlo (who has written and lectured extensively about white collar crime) estimated that Cohen will probably end up spending about two years in prison. According to Pavlo, Cohen “will earn about 5.5 months in good time credit: additional days off of his sentence for obeying the rules in prison.”
Pavlo added that “beyond that,” Cohen “can be placed at a halfway house and home confinement for a portion of his prison term. My guess is that he will get about four months halfway house/home detention. Total time served in prison will be about two years—a long time to be away from one’s family.”
Writing in New York Magazine in December, Nick Tabor predicted that “if Cohen’s sentence does stick, he could wind up serving much less than three years” due to good-behavior credits as well as “an early release to spend his last several months at home, under supervision.” Tabor stressed that Cohen is a valuable witness for federal prosecutors, and valuable witnesses are less likely to serve their full sentences.
One of the legal experts Tabor interviewed was David Kris, who was with the U.S. Justice Department under President Barack Obama. Kris told Tabor that in Mueller’s Russia investigation, Cohen is considered more helpful than Paul Manafort (Trump’s former campaign manager) but less helpful than Michael Flynn (who briefly served as national security advisor in the Trump Administration in 2017 and, like Manafort, is awaiting sentencing).
Cohen could escape prison altogether if President Trump were to grant him a federal pardon. But Cohen has stressed that even if Trump offered him one, he wouldn’t accept it. And given Trump’s obvious contempt for his former employee, the chances of him offering Cohen a pardon are slim and none."
Trump has sold out the farmers that voted for him — and now they’re racing toward calamity,Jim Hightower,"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"As a farmer told me, “You can still make a small fortune in agriculture, but the problem is you have to start with a large fortune.”
Farmers tend to be optimistic pessimists. They know the odds are against them — the bankers, bugs, monopolists, violent weather and sorry politicians. Yet, they keep at it as long as they can; working long and hard hours, enduring arduous conditions and tremendous stress to nurture the seeds that bring us an abundance of foods. But sometimes, the odds bunch up. Coping with natural disasters is to be expected. It’s the unnatural disasters of rigged economic policies, Wall Street greed and unrestrained corporate profiteering that slam the door on good, efficient family farmers, making it impossible for them to keep producing.
This is one of those times. Aside from the rise of floods, drought, tornados, etc. (hello, climate change), farmers are now in the sixth year of plummeting prices for their crops and livestock. They’re producing more than ever but getting less. For example, it costs dairy farmers on average $1.92 to produce a gallon of milk, but the giant processors pay them only a-buck-32 per gallon. No surprise then that since 2000, half of America’s dairy farmers have been squeezed out of business by monopoly pricing. And now comes Trump’s trade spat with China, which has collapsed the market and prices for grain farmers. Overall, farmers’ profits have fallen by almost half in the last five years. Farm debt, bankruptcies, sales and suicides are rising towards the calamitous levels of the 1980s farm crisis, and concentrated corporate power is fast tightening its grip on nearly all food production, prices and policies.
Indeed, a central cause of the spreading farm depression is the increasing monopolization of all the things farmers must buy (from seeds to machinery) and of the markets that buy from them. The big four biotech ag giants, for example, control 63 percent of all commercial seeds sold in the world; four meat processors control 84 percent of the U.S. beef market; and four global traders control up to 90 percent of the world’s grain sales. Our farmers and their families are hurting, but so far, our leaders, including the president, aren’t helping them.
Speaking of the president, have you noticed how often Donald Trump prefaces his policy statements with phrases like “frankly,” “honestly,” “to tell the truth,” and “believe me”?
More than a verbal tic, his constant use of these qualifiers subliminally admits that being frank, honest, truthful and believable is not normal for him. So, like a carnival flimflammer selling snake oil, he strains to convince us rubes that he’s not flimflamming: “Really,” he claims with lying lips, “in all candor, this time I’m truly telling you the gospel truth. Trust me.”
Among those who’re learning about the truthiness of The Donald are the farmers who voted for him, having bought his campaign promise to stand up for them and restore farm prosperity. Once in office, though, he quickly sold them out. First, he threw a hissy-fit of a trade war with China that ended up slapping down U.S. farmers by drastically worsening the already-low prices they were getting for their crops. Instead of prosperity, the average farm profit last year was minus $1,500!
Then, trying to smooth over this betrayal of the heartland, Trump tweeted out a message to ag producers in December that probably didn’t warm that many hearts: “Farmers, I LOVE YOU!” he professed in capital letters. (I’m guessing he offered the same sweet insincerity to Stormy Daniels after he … well, you know.)
Actions speak louder than words, of course. On March 11, Trump then took action to express his true love for farmers: He whacked $3.6 billion from the safety-net programs that offer a measure of relief to hard-hit producers when crop prices crash. Revealing his plutocratic core, the cuts specifically targeted programs that benefit small farmers — a deliberate manipulation meant to drive more families off the land and increase corporate monopolization of agriculture.
Not satisfied with intentionally injuring family farmers, Trump added insult by calling the dab of support they get from the government “overly generous.” This from a real estate flimflammer who continues to rake in millions of dollars in government cash and special tax breaks.
Far from stepping up to stop this robbery of farmers, ransacking of rural vitality and rip-off of consumers, Congress and Trump coddle the monopolistic robbers, ransackers, and rip-off artists. To help counter their insanity, join forces with the grassroots power of Farm Aid.

Mueller just dropped a hint that his team could be working on something big,Cody Fenwick,"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller included a mysterious note in a court filing Tuesday that suggests his team is busily working on a project that will soon be over.
The filing came in response to a request from the Washington Post to unseal the redacted records in Mueller’s case against Paul Manafort, who has been sentenced to around seven years in jail for crimes uncovered in the investigation. Mueller’s team was supposed to respond to this legal motion by Thursday, March 21.
But instead, Mueller requested in a new filing that the deadline be extended to April 1; he said that the Post’s attorneys had not objected to the adjustment. Judge Amy Berman Jackson granted the request.
Here’s what’s interesting: According to Mueller, the lawyers who would respond to the request “face the press of other work and require additional time to consult with the government.”
That means there’s some other, pressing matter that Mueller’s team thinks should be prioritized before it responds to the Post’s request by the initial deadline.
Vox reporter Andrew Prokop noted: “The lawyers referenced are Michael Dreeben and Adam Jed. But it’s unclear what they’re busy with at the moment. There are no imminent deadlines in Roger Stone’s case, or the two appeals from a Stone associate and a mystery company. There’s a March 25 deadline in the Russian troll farm case, but Dreeben and Jed don’t appear to be involved in that filing.”
So there’s a big open question left by the filing: What is keeping Mueller’s team so busy?
Two immediate possibilities come to mind. They could be working on more indictments, or they could be working on the much speculated about “Mueller report.” There has been extensive reporting for months now that some kind of report from the special counsel is imminently forthcoming, but no one knows exactly when; all previous predictions that were at all precise have proven false. Of course, it could be another matter entirely.
There’s a related possibility, though I should note it’s largely speculative. It’s possible that Mueller wants to put off responding to the Post’s request not only because the lawyers are busy, but also because the matter of the Manafort redactions could be resolved once the lawyers in question are finished. If the Mueller team is putting its final touches on its report, that may effectively close the investigations surrounding Manafort, and thus obviate the need to seal much of the information regarding his case in the court records."
‘This needs to be exposed’: Top Intel Democrat reveals how the Kremlin was ‘facilitating a cover up by’ Trump,Cody Fenwick,"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"In a new, detailed examination of the counterintelligence aspect of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, NBC News reported Tuesday that Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, believes the possibility that Russia may have leverage over Trump may not be getting enough scrutiny.
And near the end of the article, Schiff makes an argument that I’ve previously referenced but is routinely ignored — even in the very NBC News report that quoted the committee chair.
In the last three paragraphs of the article, reporter Ken Dilanian writes:
Schiff said he is particularly concerned about the Trump Tower Moscow project, the real estate development Cohen was pitching to the Kremlin while Trump was running for president.
He noted that when it first emerged that Cohen had emailed Putin’s office seeking help, Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri Pescov, said he never answered the email. But it later emerged in court documents that an assistant to Pescov did respond, emailing Cohen and asking him to call, which he did.
“So here we had the Kremlin facilitating a cover up by the president of the United States,” Schiff said. “This needs to be exposed.”
Indeed, even as the Kremlin was lying about its ties to the Trump campaign, Cohen himself lied to Congress and Mueller about the extent of the Trump Tower Moscow deal in an attempt to downplay its significance. Cohen has since pleaded guilty to those criminal lies. And when he testified before the House Government Oversight Committee in February, Cohen said he told these lies in an effort to please the president and follow his lead. At one meeting to discuss the Russia investigation before he lied to Congress, Cohen said, he spoke with Trump and was told — falsely — there was no “collusion” and no “deal.”
So, in essence, Trump’s personal attorney committed a crime to further a cover-up that was done in concert with — either explicitly or implicitly — the Kremlin. And, from all appearances, it looks like Trump was directing this cover-up. There’s another word you might use for this behavior: collusion.
But bizarrely, despite having all this information, Dilanian writes: “some of the key figures seen as likely participants in any Russia conspiracy — Mike Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Michael Cohen — have been charged with other offenses in cases that made no allegation of any ‘collusion’ with Russia.”
There’s no reason to think Mueller should have to use the word “collusion” to describe this behavior — but it fits the commonsense definition, and it’s baffling that informed observers of the investigation can’t recognize it. It seems the word “collusion” has come to be redefined to mean, in this context, some extremely specific and overt type of behavior which may indeed never happened, but it’s unclear why we should accept these word games.

Now Trump thinks even Fox News is biased against him,N/A,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 01:19:22 GMT",N/A,
‘He is going to go bonkers’: Former prosecutor reveals how Trump could violate the law if he overreacts to the Mueller report,Cody Fenwick,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT",N/A,"Aides to President Donald Trump fear what he might do when and if Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s final report reveals what they told investigators, according to multiple outlets on Tuesday.
One Republican told CNN that the tensions are “very high” as the White House waits for the report.
“They cooperated and had to tell the truth,” the Republican said. “He is going to go bonkers.”
“They got asked questions and told the truth, and now they’re worried the wrath will follow,” a former White House official told NBC News.
Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor and legal analyst for CNN, noted that these fears aren’t mere palace intrigue — they could presage crimes by the president.
“Trump needs to be careful here,” Honig tweeted. “It is a federal crime to retaliate against a witness who has provided information to law enforcement. (18 USC 1513 if you want to look it up).”
The relevant section of the statute reads as follows:
Whoever knowingly, with the intent to retaliate, takes any action harmful to any person, including interference with the lawful employment or livelihood of any person, for providing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any Federal offense, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.
So if, in a hypothetical scenario, the report reveals that a current employee of the Trump Organization or the White House told Mueller damaging or unflattering information about the president, and Trump fires them in retaliation, he could be committing a crime.
There are several potential saving graces for the president here. First, many of the people who are known to have testified in the investigation — Hope Hicks, John Kelly, Reince Priebus, Don McGahn — no longer work for him. It would thus be harder, and perhaps less tempting, for him to retaliate against them. Second, impulsive as he may be, Trump may be wary enough from the problems caused by firing former FBI Director James Comey that he would hesitate before lashing out in response to the Mueller report.
And even if Trump did commit the crime of retaliating against a witness, it’s not clear who would or could bring charges. He’s already committed so many outrageous and obstructive acts during the course of the investigation — acts the report itself will presumably detail — that Republicans in Congress have shown little interest in holding him accountable for. There’s little chance that one more crime would push them over the edge."
