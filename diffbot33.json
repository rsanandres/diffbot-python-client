It's a lesson he learned from Amanda Nguyen, who wrote the <a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2018/10/04/metoo-me-too-sexual-assault-survivors-rights-bill/1074976002/\">Sexual Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights</a> which passed <a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5578\">Congress unanimously</a> in 2016.</p>\n<p>Through her civil rights nonprofit Rise, Nguyen helped pass 21 bills affecting 40 million people.</p>\n<p>Schentrup and his group, <a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.risenow.us/campaigns/zerousa\">Zero USA</a>, whose mission is to pass legislation to help end gun violence, is the first to come out of <a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.risenow.us/\">Rise's newly launched Justice Lab</a>, an accelerator program that's a riff on tech incubators for social justice movements. The incubator trains activists to compose and pass legislation using funding that Rise received through individual donations as well as from foundations including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.</p>\n<p>Nguyen describes the training as brutally analytical and aggressively bipartisan, which she credits with helping her achieve unanimous support for her bill fighting sexual violence. And what makes her confident in aiding Schentrup take on gun violence.</p>\n<p>&quot;A lot of people have this misconception that because our 21 laws passed unanimously that somehow it&rsquo;s easy. But if the issue of sexual violence were easy, then Kavanaugh, the 2016 election, the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) renewal, Title IX, among many other things would be litigated differently,&quot; Nguyen said. &quot;So it&rsquo;s not by the good will, unfortunately, of Republicans and Democrats coming together that&rsquo;s given us the success that we&rsquo;ve had. The track record that we have is specifically because we strategized amongst it.&quot;</p>\n<p>That strategic approach led Zero USA to identified two key legislative goals: the passage of extreme risk protective orders and disarming domestic abusers. Both are personal for Schentrup &ndash; <a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/02/23/florida-school-shooting-sheriff-got-18-calls-cruzs-violence-threats-guns/366165002/\">sheriff's deputies received at least 18 calls</a> warning them about the Parkland shooter, many of which were domestic violence related.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://uw-media.usatoday.com/embed/video/3451469002?sitelabel=reimagine&placement=snow-smallarticleinlinehtml5&keywords=stoneman-douglas-high-school-shooting%2Ccrime%2Cdemocrats%2Cdisaster-accident-and-tragedy%2Crepublicans%2Csadness%2Csuffering%2Cfear%2Coverall-very-negative%2Claws%2Cbills-law%2Cgun-laws%2Cgun-crime%2Ctestimony%2Chearings-and-trials%2Cnra&simpleTarget=disasters&simpleExclusion=disasters&pagetype=story&cst=news&ssts=news&series=\"></img></figure>\n<p>They were also identified as potential bipartisan solutions, something that is frequently missing in debate around gun control.</p>\n<p><a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/10/parkland-one-year-after-shooting-where-key-figures-are-now/2721798002/\">&quot;Red flag&quot; policies</a> have seen renewed support since the Parkland shooting, as well as following the recent apparent suicides of two Parkland survivors and the father of a student killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School.</p>\n<p>In the past, the NRA has fought &quot;red flag&quot; legislation as &quot;anti-gun&quot; but has recently expressed greater openness to protective orders. In an <a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/19/under-pressure-nra-voices-support-gun-violence-restraining-orders/433716002/\">NRATV video last spring</a>, the group&rsquo;s top lobbyist said Congress should provide funding for states to adopt &ldquo;risk protection orders.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., reintroduced a bill in Congress earlier this year to do just that, and in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last month, chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., indicated the state level would be a good place to start.</p>\n<p>One such law passed in Florida as part of school safety reform after the Parkland shooting. And on Friday, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis <a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2019/04/12/red-flag-gun-law-colorado/\">signed a similar measure into law</a> in his state, the fifteenth to do so along with the District of Columbia. Schentrup was a vocal proponent of the bill, writing op-eds and testifying at hearings.</p>\n<p>But the battle still looks Sisyphean.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://uw-media.usatoday.com/embed/video/110701320?sitelabel=reimagine&placement=snow-smallarticleinlinehtml5&keywords=stoneman-douglas-high-school-shooting%2Ccrime%2Cdemocrats%2Cdisaster-accident-and-tragedy%2Crepublicans%2Csadness%2Csuffering%2Cfear%2Coverall-very-negative%2Claws%2Cbills-law%2Cgun-laws%2Cgun-crime%2Ctestimony%2Chearings-and-trials%2Cnra&simpleTarget=disasters&simpleExclusion=disasters&pagetype=story&cst=news&ssts=news&series=\"></img></figure>\n<p>For all the talk of support, there is significant opposition to &quot;red flag&quot; laws. The new Colorado law may still face legal hurdles &ndash; <a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/us/colorado-red-flag-gun-laws/index.html\">sheriffs have voiced concerns</a> that it threatens citizens' constitutional rights to gun ownership and due process and have threatened not to enforce it.</p>\n<p>Asked if there was any room for compromise on &quot;red flag&quot; laws, Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for Gun Owners of America (GOA), said &quot;no.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I and Gun Owners of America have taken the position that these are far from noncontroversial and are just Orwellian,&quot; Hammond said.</p>\n<p>Hammond and GOA find particular fault with ex parte, or a unilateral decision by a judge without requiring all parties to be present. Some of the state bills allow for hearings, and Colorado law provides the gun owner with free legal counsel. But Hammond says the core of the provisions are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>&quot;For me to believe (advocates) are generally serious about due process, they&rsquo;d have to start by knocking out ex parte orders.&quot;</p>\n<p>The NRA has also found fault with many state provisions, <a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/19/under-pressure-nra-voices-support-gun-violence-restraining-orders/433716002/\">proposing a lengthy list of caveats</a>, including penalties for frivolous claims.</p>\n<p><a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2019/03/red-flag-law-senate-hearing-republicans/\">Graham stopped short</a> of supporting a national bill in the March Senate Judiciary Committee hearing saying, &ldquo;I think passing a federal law is beyond what the market will bear.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gun control politics have threatened to derail the <a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/04/violence-against-women-act-guns-metoo-complicate-abuse-debate/3332415002/\">renewal of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)</a> in recent weeks, a 25-year-old law aimed at reducing domestic and sexual violence that has historically had bipartisan support. A provision to stop those with misdemeanor stalking convictions from buying a gun has drawn condemnation from the NRA, which argues that the provision is too broad and would ensnare people for minor offenses, such as a tweet. The NRA warned lawmakers that a vote for the bill would ding their ratings from the group. <a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/violence-women-act-clears-house\">The bill passed the House</a> this month with a vote of 263-158. Most Republicans voted against it, though 33 broke with the party and NRA to vote for it. It's not expected to be taken up in it's current form in the Republican-controlled Senate.</p>\n<p>Schentrup has taken on similar provisions in state legislation that, like those in VAWA, are aimed at closing the &quot;boyfriend loophole,&quot; a term coined by advocates in reference to intimate partner violence outside of marriage, often affecting teens and others who don't have the same access to protections afforded to those who are married or living together. A <a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2730578?guestAccessKey=9f6da9e5-4348-47a4-8fb1-68076780e08e&utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=041519\">study released Monday</a> found that nearly 7% of adolescents killed between 2003 and 2016 were killed by <a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/15/713469721/teen-dating-violence-can-lead-to-homicide-girls-are-the-most-common-victims\">current or former intimate partners</a>, and of those, 61% involved firearms.</p>\n<p>Stats like those inspired Schentrup's work to close the loophole. And leave him hopeful in the face of blowback.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s very contentious with VAWA and on a lot of right-wing sites. I saw a Breitbart headline saying &lsquo;Democrats look to seize everyone&rsquo;s guns.&rsquo; But that&rsquo;s not what this legislation looks to do. It aims to make sure more people have access to the rights they need,&quot; Schentrup said.</p>\n<p>Schentrup's tendency to double-back on the policy details and data that support it is what initially impressed Nguyen when they met last summer, inspiring her to create the incubator within Rise.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was blown away when I met Robert,&quot; Nguyen said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget when Robert sat next to me and he described a meeting that he and his family had with a politician and that politician said, &lsquo;I want to work on gun violence, but I can&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;ll lose my seat in the primary.&rsquo; And instead of being mad, Robert said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I just want to make it safe for this person to vote, because I don&rsquo;t want to lose my other sister to gun violence.&rsquo; That to me is what it takes in order to cut through the political fray and get things done.&quot;</p>\n<p>Schentrup has understood that bipartisan mentality from the beginning. About a week after the Parkland shooting, he found himself on stage at a town hall with NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch. He says focusing on the reasons behind her views, imagining her own experiences, helped him see past their difference of opinions.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://uw-media.usatoday.com/embed/video/110717542?sitelabel=reimagine&placement=snow-smallarticleinlinehtml5&keywords=stoneman-douglas-high-school-shooting%2Ccrime%2Cdemocrats%2Cdisaster-accident-and-tragedy%2Crepublicans%2Csadness%2Csuffering%2Cfear%2Coverall-very-negative%2Claws%2Cbills-law%2Cgun-laws%2Cgun-crime%2Ctestimony%2Chearings-and-trials%2Cnra&simpleTarget=disasters&simpleExclusion=disasters&pagetype=story&cst=news&ssts=news&series=\"></img></figure>\n<p>&quot;A lot of what she said in the aftermath for a lot of people, a lot of survivors I know, was very triggering,&quot; said Schentrup. He says focusing on the reasons behind Loesch's views helped him &quot;better understand exactly where she&rsquo;s coming from and that she&rsquo;s not some terrible monster person. Because so often we try to paint the other side as being inhuman.&quot;</p>\n<p>Schentrup further flexed those muscles during a trip last summer that took him around the South to speak about gun violence. And in December, where he and fellow Parkland families met with the Trump administration to discuss school safety, including safe storage and protective orders. It included time in the Oval Office with Trump and what Schentrup describes as a substantive back-and-forth on policy merits.</p>\n<p>&quot;I always try to remember, no one actually wants people to keep dying of gun violence. Its just with both sides we have different ideas of how to achieve that goal,&quot; Schentrup said. &quot;But we have the common goal of wanting to reduce death, so how do we do that and how do we get to a place?&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>ANALYSIS: </strong><a data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2018/10/04/metoo-me-too-sexual-assault-survivors-rights-bill/1074976002/\">#MeToo was a culture shock.

                "text": "Robert Schentrup and Amanda Nguyen, founder of civil rights nonprofit Rise, discuss finding compromise on contentious issues like gun violence. USA TODAY\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Someone who lost his sister in the Parkland school shooting might not be the first person you'd expect to defend the National Rifle Association.\nYet, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School alumnus Robert Schentrup is quick to praise the NRA's contributions to the debate on gun regulation in America.\n\u201cI like to tell people the NRA has actually brought up some pretty good ideas,\" Schentrup said. \"They actually come to the table with more than 'no, we don't like this.' They come to the table with specific concerns. ... And they come with specific solutions.\"\nHe points to penalties for those who bring \u201cfalse or frivolous\u201d charges in extreme risk protection order (ERPO) legislation as one example. The junior at University of Central Florida (UCF) is pushing for the adoption of ERPO or \"red flag\" laws, which allow law enforcement or family members to petition a judge for the removal of firearms from a person who poses a risk of harm to themselves or others. The goal is to prevent future mass shootings in cases like Parkland where shooters showed warning signs of potentially violent behavior, as well as help those who are at risk for suicide, which accounts for nearly 60% of gun deaths in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n(Photo: Matthew Sobocinski)\nAnd in order to get laws passed, Schentrup is open to compromises, such as those frivolous-petition penalties, that other advocates may not be. It's a lesson he learned from Amanda Nguyen, who wrote the Sexual Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights which passed Congress unanimously in 2016.\nThrough her civil rights nonprofit Rise, Nguyen helped pass 21 bills affecting 40 million people.\nSchentrup and his group, Zero USA, whose mission is to pass legislation to help end gun violence, is the first to come out of Rise's newly launched Justice Lab, an accelerator program that's a riff on tech incubators for social justice movements. The incubator trains activists to compose and pass legislation using funding that Rise received through individual donations as well as from foundations including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\nNguyen describes the training as brutally analytical and aggressively bipartisan, which she credits with helping her achieve unanimous support for her bill fighting sexual violence. And what makes her confident in aiding Schentrup take on gun violence.\n\"A lot of people have this misconception that because our 21 laws passed unanimously that somehow it\u2019s easy. But if the issue of sexual violence were easy, then Kavanaugh, the 2016 election, the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) renewal, Title IX, among many other things would be litigated differently,\" Nguyen said. \"So it\u2019s not by the good will, unfortunately, of Republicans and Democrats coming together that\u2019s given us the success that we\u2019ve had. The track record that we have is specifically because we strategized amongst it.\"\nThat strategic approach led Zero USA to identified two key legislative goals: the passage of extreme risk protective orders and disarming domestic abusers. Both are personal for Schentrup \u2013 sheriff's deputies received at least 18 calls warning them about the Parkland shooter, many of which were domestic violence related.\nThey were also identified as potential bipartisan solutions, something that is frequently missing in debate around gun control.\n\"Red flag\" policies have seen renewed support since the Parkland shooting, as well as following the recent apparent suicides of two Parkland survivors and the father of a student killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nIn the past, the NRA has fought \"red flag\" legislation as \"anti-gun\" but has recently expressed greater openness to protective orders. In an NRATV video last spring, the group\u2019s top lobbyist said Congress should provide funding for states to adopt \u201crisk protection orders.\u201d\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., reintroduced a bill in Congress earlier this year to do just that, and in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last month, chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., indicated the state level would be a good place to start.\nOne such law passed in Florida as part of school safety reform after the Parkland shooting. And on Friday, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed a similar measure into law in his state, the fifteenth to do so along with the District of Columbia. Schentrup was a vocal proponent of the bill, writing op-eds and testifying at hearings.\nBut the battle still looks Sisyphean.\nFor all the talk of support, there is significant opposition to \"red flag\" laws. The new Colorado law may still face legal hurdles \u2013 sheriffs have voiced concerns that it threatens citizens' constitutional rights to gun ownership and due process and have threatened not to enforce it.\nAsked if there was any room for compromise on \"red flag\" laws, Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for Gun Owners of America (GOA), said \"no.\"\n\"I and Gun Owners of America have taken the position that these are far from noncontroversial and are just Orwellian,\" Hammond said.\nHammond and GOA find particular fault with ex parte, or a unilateral decision by a judge without requiring all parties to be present. Some of the state bills allow for hearings, and Colorado law provides the gun owner with free legal counsel. But Hammond says the core of the provisions are unconstitutional.\n\"For me to believe (advocates) are generally serious about due process, they\u2019d have to start by knocking out ex parte orders.\"\nThe NRA has also found fault with many state provisions, proposing a lengthy list of caveats, including penalties for frivolous claims.\nGraham stopped short of supporting a national bill in the March Senate Judiciary Committee hearing saying, \u201cI think passing a federal law is beyond what the market will bear.\u201d\nGun control politics have threatened to derail the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in recent weeks, a 25-year-old law aimed at reducing domestic and sexual violence that has historically had bipartisan support. A provision to stop those with misdemeanor stalking convictions from buying a gun has drawn condemnation from the NRA, which argues that the provision is too broad and would ensnare people for minor offenses, such as a tweet. The NRA warned lawmakers that a vote for the bill would ding their ratings from the group. The bill passed the House this month with a vote of 263-158. Most Republicans voted against it, though 33 broke with the party and NRA to vote for it. It's not expected to be taken up in it's current form in the Republican-controlled Senate.\nSchentrup has taken on similar provisions in state legislation that, like those in VAWA, are aimed at closing the \"boyfriend loophole,\" a term coined by advocates in reference to intimate partner violence outside of marriage, often affecting teens and others who don't have the same access to protections afforded to those who are married or living together. A study released Monday found that nearly 7% of adolescents killed between 2003 and 2016 were killed by current or former intimate partners, and of those, 61% involved firearms.\nStats like those inspired Schentrup's work to close the loophole. And leave him hopeful in the face of blowback.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s very contentious with VAWA and on a lot of right-wing sites. I saw a Breitbart headline saying \u2018Democrats look to seize everyone\u2019s guns.\u2019 But that\u2019s not what this legislation looks to do. It aims to make sure more people have access to the rights they need,\" Schentrup said.\nSchentrup's tendency to double-back on the policy details and data that support it is what initially impressed Nguyen when they met last summer, inspiring her to create the incubator within Rise.\n\u201cI was blown away when I met Robert,\" Nguyen said. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget when Robert sat next to me and he described a meeting that he and his family had with a politician and that politician said, \u2018I want to work on gun violence, but I can\u2019t because I\u2019ll lose my seat in the primary.\u2019 And instead of being mad, Robert said, \u2018I don\u2019t care. I just want to make it safe for this person to vote, because I don\u2019t want to lose my other sister to gun violence.\u2019 That to me is what it takes in order to cut through the political fray and get things done.\"\nSchentrup has understood that bipartisan mentality from the beginning. About a week after the Parkland shooting, he found himself on stage at a town hall with NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch. He says focusing on the reasons behind her views, imagining her own experiences, helped him see past their difference of opinions.\n\"A lot of what she said in the aftermath for a lot of people, a lot of survivors I know, was very triggering,\" said Schentrup. He says focusing on the reasons behind Loesch's views helped him \"better understand exactly where she\u2019s coming from and that she\u2019s not some terrible monster person. Because so often we try to paint the other side as being inhuman.\"\nSchentrup further flexed those muscles during a trip last summer that took him around the South to speak about gun violence. And in December, where he and fellow Parkland families met with the Trump administration to discuss school safety, including safe storage and protective orders. It included time in the Oval Office with Trump and what Schentrup describes as a substantive back-and-forth on policy merits.\n\"I always try to remember, no one actually wants people to keep dying of gun violence. Its just with both sides we have different ideas of how to achieve that goal,\" Schentrup said. \"But we have the common goal of wanting to reduce death, so how do we do that and how do we get to a place?\"\nANALYSIS: #MeToo was a culture shock. But changing laws will take more than a year.",

                "text": "Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg responds to anti-gay hecklers at a rally in Iowa. USA TODAY\nProtesters shouting about \"Sodom and Gomorrah\" interrupted South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg on Tuesday at an Iowa campaign rally.\nButtigieg hopes to become the first openly gay president in American history.\nOne of the men who shouted about the biblical cities destroyed by God's wrath for their sinful ways was Randall Terry, a Christian activist who founded the anti-abortion rights group Operation Rescue. The organization says it split with him 18 years ago and now considers him too radical.\nThe crowd at the Des Moines rally drowned out Terry's shouts by cheering Buttigieg\u2019s name.\n\"The good news is, the condition of my soul is in the hands of God, but the Iowa caucuses are up to you,\" an unshaken Buttigieg responded, pointing at the crowd.\nCNN's Jeff Zeleny reported that Buttigieg was interrupted three times by protesters affiliated with Terry.\n'Let's make history': Pete Buttigieg officially announces he is running for president\nMore: Buttigieg outpolling most of Democratic field in early states\nToday in Iowa, @PeteButtigieg was interrupted three times by hecklers. Turns out, it was an organized effort by out-of-state, attention seeker Randall Terry. Buttigieg's response is notable: \"The condition of my soul is in the hands of God, but the Iowa caucuses are up to you.\"\n\u2014 Jeff Zeleny (@jeffzeleny) April 17, 2019\nAnother video from the rally showed one of the other protesters shout \"baby killer\" and \"Sodomite\" while appearing to point in Buttigieg's direction.\n\"Remember Sodom and Gomorrah,\" he yelled over the crowd's chants of \"Pete!\"\nButtigieg was also confronted by a protester at a smaller event in Fort Dodge, Iowa, earlier on Tuesday after he brought up the subject of same-sex marriage.\n\"Grandparents, do you want your grandchildren following his example?\" the man yelled as audience members booed over him, in a CNN video.\nGesturing toward Buttigieg, he shouted, \"God loves us, but he stands for the murder of unborn babies!\"\n\"Coffee after church gets a little rowdy sometimes,\" Buttigieg quipped after the man was escorted from the room. \"That gentleman believes that what he is doing is in line with the will of the creator. I view it differently. We ought to be able to view it differently.\"\nButtigieg supports abortion rights and said at an event in South Carolina last month, \"You\u2019re not free if your reproductive choices are being dictated by male politicians in Washington.\"\nAn Afghanistan veteran and former U.S. Navy intelligence officer who speaks multiple languages, Buttigieg has been drawing crowds and headlines as he surges in early polling in the 2020 Democratic primary.\nHe also is a practicing Christian who says there is no reason his sexuality and faith have to be mutually exclusive. Buttigieg has called out Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 whom he knows from Pence's time as Indiana governor \u2013 for a \"religious freedom\" law Pence backed that critics said allowed for discrimination against gay people.\n\"If you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator,\" he said of Pence's views.\nPence responded by accusing Buttigieg of being \"critical of my Christian faith and about me personally.\"\n\"He knows better,\" Pence told CNBC in an interview that aired last week. \"He knows me.\"\nButtigieg on 'Ellen': Pence should say he's 'changed his mind' and back legal protections for gay people\nTerry, the heckler at Tuesday's rally, plans to \"spend a lot of time\" in Iowa hounding Democratic presidential candidates, he told The Hawk Eye.\n\"My goal is to wake up the Christians who are still voting Democrat and to say to them to put loyalty to God and the babies first,\" he said, according to The Hawk Eye.\nA passionate supporter of President Donald Trump for his appointment of Supreme Court justices Terry believes will lead to the overturn of Roe v. Wade, Terry toured the nation in 2016 in a bus emblazoned with the words \"It Is A Sin To Vote For Hillary.\"\nTerry was the founder and leader of Operation Rescue, which came to fame in the 1980s as its members conducted sit-ins and blocked the entrances to abortion clinics. But he and the organization eventually parted ways and the group said in a 2009 statement still posted on its website that \"Randall Terry is not affiliated with Operation Rescue and does not speak for this organization in any way.\"\nOperation Rescue said the main reason for its disavowal of its former leader was a statement that it said Terry made appearing to condone the 2009 murder of George Tiller, a Kansas doctor who performed abortions and was fatally shot in a Wichita church.\nAccording to the group, Terry said Tiller's murder, \"has the potential to propel us more quickly to our goal.\"\nContributing: Barbara Rodriguez, Des Moines Register; Brian Lyman, Montgomery Advertiser; and Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY",

Officials have ruled out arson as well as possible terror-related motives, but that didn\u2019t stop misinformation and hoaxes from circulating on social media.\nInfoWars, the far-right conspiracy website run by Alex Jones, published a story based on a since-deleted tweet from Christopher J. Hale claiming the fire was \u201cdeliberately\u201d set. Hale, who describes himself as a contributor to TIME & Fox News, clarified that his initial tweet was an \"unsubstantiated rumor.\"\nInfowars writer Paul Joseph Watson included a video he tweeted that appears to show people with Arabic-sounding names reacting with \"smiley faces\" to a Facebook post about the fire.\nWhile Watson presented this as evidence of those people \u201ccelebrating\u201d the fire, Buzzfeed News pointed out \u201cit's impossible to know why people chose a specific emoji, or for that matter the religion of people reacting to a Facebook video.\u201d\nWant news from USA TODAY on WhatsApp?

The article has since been updated to confirm the story is not about the recent blaze.\nMisinformation has also spread from accounts claiming to be legitimate news sources. CNN reported that a fake Twitter account created in April to look like one operated by the network falsely claimed the fire was caused by terrorism.\nThe account was taken down within hours after CNN publicly criticized Twitter over it.\nA Twitter spokesperson told the Washington Post that the company is reviewing reports of disinformation related to the blaze.\n\"The team is reviewing reports and if they are in violation suspending them per the Twitter Rules,\" the spokesperson told the Post. \"Our focus continues to be detecting and removing coordinated attempts to manipulate the conversation at speed and scale.\"\nRelics saved: Notre Dame's oldest stained-glass rose windows survived; other relics moved just in time\nFirefighters battle the blaze: Paris Fire Brigade chaplain braved the blaze to rescue cathedral treasures",

                "html": "<p>Opinion contributor</p>\n<p>Amid the never-ending parade of negative publicity surrounding big tech companies, it can be difficult these days to remember that not everything involving the Internet is terrible. But bright spots do remain. A task as simple as booking a hotel, for example, was incredibly difficult and time-consuming in the pre-digital world. Silicon Valley may have its faults, but consumers clearly benefit from the ability to compare travel options online.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, what is good for consumers is not always welcome among established incumbents. Together, the hotel industry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Big 6&rdquo; &mdash; Hilton, Marriott, Choice, IHG, Wyndham, and Hyatt &mdash; have gobbled up a majority of U.S. hotel rooms. Two pending antitrust lawsuits paint a compelling story of an agreement among these industry giants to stifle competition, raise prices, and prevent comparison shopping by consumers.</p>\n<p>Late last month, a federal court in Illinois bolstered these claims by allowing one of the lawsuits to <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-leisure-antitrust/lawsuit-on-hotels-internet-advertising-tactics-moves-forward-idUSKCN1R22JT\">move forward</a>, and this week, oral arguments are set in a second suit, brought by online travel agency TravelPass Group. Both portray a hidden conspiracy that may have had a harmful &mdash; and ongoing &mdash; impact on travelers.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more commentary:</strong></p>\n<p>To illustrate, try a simple experiment: Type &ldquo;<a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS800US801&ei=-R22XKeTMYXI_QbK7a2QDw&q=marriott+dallas&oq=marriott+dallas&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i71l8.0.0..1324...0.0..0.0.0.......0......gws-wiz.X58dq36_CuE\">Marriott Dallas</a>&rdquo; into your Google search bar. Several years ago, that keyword search would likely have yielded a wide variety of paid advertisements at the top of the page. One of them may have linked directly to Marriott&rsquo;s website. But others would have featured competing hotels &mdash; think Hilton, Hyatt, or Wyndham &mdash; as well as online travel agencies like Expedia and Priceline.</p>\n<p>Today, your search results probably look quite different. Most consumers will see only one type of advertisement at the top of the results: a link directly to Marriott&rsquo;s own websites. Competitor ads seem to have vanished altogether, and online travel agency ads are increasingly hard to find.</p>\n<p>The change was abrupt. Google search data suggests that, in late 2014, the Big 6 suddenly stopped bidding on one another&rsquo;s branded keywords, according to one of the lawsuits.</p>\n<p>Under the antitrust laws, collusion among competitors is regarded as &ldquo;the supreme evil.&rdquo; The adverse effects on consumers are typically immediate and substantial.</p>\n<h3>Hotel cabal wants to limit your choices</h3>\n<p>How might consumers be harmed by a collusive agreement among the Big 6? According to a 2014 Google study, keyword searching was the most common starting point for consumers seeking to book hotel rooms online. Even more importantly, Google found that consumers who searched for a specific hotel brand would often end up purchasing a room from another brand. Search results are an important driver of consumer behavior.</p>\n<p>This type of searching and switching is essential for robust online competition &mdash; whether massive hotel groups like it or not.</p>\n<p>And it occurs every day among consumers seeking out countless other products. We may initially look for Coca-Cola at the supermarket, or Nike trainers at a shoe store, but then end up trying a new or different brand after comparing products and prices. What healthy free-market system would allow Coke or Nike to collude with competitors to fence off their respective brands so that shoppers could see only the one brand they were initially seeking?</p>\n<p>Yet the pending lawsuits against the Big 6 depict just such a restriction. Disturbingly, this may be part of a broader trend. The lawsuits come on the heels of the Federal Trade Commission&rsquo;s decision in a case against <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/141-0200/1-800-contacts-inc-matter\">1-800 Contacts</a>, which found that a similar agreement among another group of rivals unlawfully harmed competition and consumers.</p>\n<h3>Antitrust laws protect the public at large</h3>\n<p>Left to their own devices, companies in a variety of markets will choose to collude rather than compete. By stifling competition, collusive agreements can allow participants to raise prices, impose added fees, avoid competing on quality, and disadvantage innovative new challengers. In the context of online search, the danger is clear: as the FTC&rsquo;s 1-800 Contacts opinion observes, search is the &ldquo;<a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/docket_no_9372_opinion_of_the_commission_redacted_public_version.pdf\">very means</a>&rdquo; by which competition takes place in the modern digital economy.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, online lending clearinghouse LendingTree made a splash with its slogan, &ldquo;<a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaOzfCHpAxU\">When banks compete, you win</a>.&rdquo; Unfortunately, the inverse is equally true: when companies stop competing, we lose. Antitrust laws can be an effective remedy, but only when they are actively enforced.</p>\n<p>The private plaintiffs challenging the Big 6 hotel groups have already shed important light on an often opaque market. But antitrust laws are also about protecting the public at large, and if collusive agreements are not halted in one market, they may well spread to others. <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-15/google-investigation-state-attorneys-general-lay-groundwork\">State attorneys general</a> and the <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-makan-delrahim-delivers-keynote-address-silicon-flatirons\">U.S. Department of Justice</a>, along with the <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/ftcs-bureau-competition-launches-task-force-monitor-technology\">Federal Trade Commission</a>, have all signaled their desire to promote online competition.

                "text": "Opinion contributor\nAmid the never-ending parade of negative publicity surrounding big tech companies, it can be difficult these days to remember that not everything involving the Internet is terrible. But bright spots do remain. A task as simple as booking a hotel, for example, was incredibly difficult and time-consuming in the pre-digital world. Silicon Valley may have its faults, but consumers clearly benefit from the ability to compare travel options online.\nUnfortunately, what is good for consumers is not always welcome among established incumbents. Together, the hotel industry\u2019s \u201cBig 6\u201d \u2014 Hilton, Marriott, Choice, IHG, Wyndham, and Hyatt \u2014 have gobbled up a majority of U.S. hotel rooms. Two pending antitrust lawsuits paint a compelling story of an agreement among these industry giants to stifle competition, raise prices, and prevent comparison shopping by consumers.\nLate last month, a federal court in Illinois bolstered these claims by allowing one of the lawsuits to move forward, and this week, oral arguments are set in a second suit, brought by online travel agency TravelPass Group. Both portray a hidden conspiracy that may have had a harmful \u2014 and ongoing \u2014 impact on travelers.\nRead more commentary:\nTo illustrate, try a simple experiment: Type \u201cMarriott Dallas\u201d into your Google search bar. Several years ago, that keyword search would likely have yielded a wide variety of paid advertisements at the top of the page. One of them may have linked directly to Marriott\u2019s website. But others would have featured competing hotels \u2014 think Hilton, Hyatt, or Wyndham \u2014 as well as online travel agencies like Expedia and Priceline.\nToday, your search results probably look quite different. Most consumers will see only one type of advertisement at the top of the results: a link directly to Marriott\u2019s own websites. Competitor ads seem to have vanished altogether, and online travel agency ads are increasingly hard to find.\nThe change was abrupt. Google search data suggests that, in late 2014, the Big 6 suddenly stopped bidding on one another\u2019s branded keywords, according to one of the lawsuits.\nUnder the antitrust laws, collusion among competitors is regarded as \u201cthe supreme evil.\u201d The adverse effects on consumers are typically immediate and substantial.\nHotel cabal wants to limit your choices\nHow might consumers be harmed by a collusive agreement among the Big 6? According to a 2014 Google study, keyword searching was the most common starting point for consumers seeking to book hotel rooms online. Even more importantly, Google found that consumers who searched for a specific hotel brand would often end up purchasing a room from another brand. Search results are an important driver of consumer behavior.\nThis type of searching and switching is essential for robust online competition \u2014 whether massive hotel groups like it or not.\nAnd it occurs every day among consumers seeking out countless other products. We may initially look for Coca-Cola at the supermarket, or Nike trainers at a shoe store, but then end up trying a new or different brand after comparing products and prices. What healthy free-market system would allow Coke or Nike to collude with competitors to fence off their respective brands so that shoppers could see only the one brand they were initially seeking?\nYet the pending lawsuits against the Big 6 depict just such a restriction. Disturbingly, this may be part of a broader trend. The lawsuits come on the heels of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s decision in a case against 1-800 Contacts, which found that a similar agreement among another group of rivals unlawfully harmed competition and consumers.\nAntitrust laws protect the public at large\nLeft to their own devices, companies in a variety of markets will choose to collude rather than compete. By stifling competition, collusive agreements can allow participants to raise prices, impose added fees, avoid competing on quality, and disadvantage innovative new challengers. In the context of online search, the danger is clear: as the FTC\u2019s 1-800 Contacts opinion observes, search is the \u201cvery means\u201d by which competition takes place in the modern digital economy.\nA few years ago, online lending clearinghouse LendingTree made a splash with its slogan, \u201cWhen banks compete, you win.\u201d Unfortunately, the inverse is equally true: when companies stop competing, we lose. Antitrust laws can be an effective remedy, but only when they are actively enforced.\nThe private plaintiffs challenging the Big 6 hotel groups have already shed important light on an often opaque market. But antitrust laws are also about protecting the public at large, and if collusive agreements are not halted in one market, they may well spread to others. State attorneys general and the U.S. Department of Justice, along with the Federal Trade Commission, have all signaled their desire to promote online competition. This may be a good moment to join the fight.\nJohn M. Newman is a law professor at the University of Memphis School of Law specializing in antitrust, a former trial attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice, and author of the forthcoming article \u201cAntitrust in Digital Markets.\u201d",

Ilhan Omar says caused a spike in threats against her life.</p>\n<p>During a visit to Minnesota, Omar&rsquo;s home state, Trump told a local reporter why he tweeted a video Friday that interspersed a single sentence Omar said &mdash; &rdquo;some people did something&rdquo; &mdash; with footage from the terrorist attacks.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been very disrespectful to this country,&rdquo; Trump said of Omar. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been very disrespectful, frankly, to Israel. She is somebody that doesn&rsquo;t really understand, I think, life, real life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Omar, a former refugee who escaped Somalia&rsquo;s civil war, is one of only two Muslim women ever elected to Congress. She and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47938273\">her family spent four years</a> at a refugee camp in Kenya before coming to the U.S. Numerous progressives and Democrats have defended Omar from Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/a3xz35/ilhan-omars-defenders-say-trumps-911-tweet-is-endangering-her-life\">attacks by saying that his rhetoric is encouraging violence against the congresswoman, her family, and other Muslim people</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate,&rdquo; Trump continued. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a way about her that&rsquo;s very, very bad, I think, for our country.

We are going to change that. We will change it.&quot;</p>\n<p>Omar is the most vocal critic of the Israeli government in Congress and among the most high-profile freshman members of the House. Republicans and some Democrats have accused Omar of anti-Semitism over her criticism of Israel, pro-Israel lobbyists, and Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. She has been targeted by numerous threats of violence since taking office. Earlier this month, the FBI arrested a man who allegedly <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/wjmwgm/fbi-arrests-man-for-allegedly-threatening-to-murder-ilhan-omar\">called Omar&rsquo;s office and threatened to shoot her in the head</a>.</p>\n<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi didn&rsquo;t directly defend Omar from Trump&rsquo;s attacks until Sunday.

                "text": "President Trump has no regrets about tweeting a 9/11 video that Rep. Ilhan Omar says caused a spike in threats against her life.\nDuring a visit to Minnesota, Omar\u2019s home state, Trump told a local reporter why he tweeted a video Friday that interspersed a single sentence Omar said \u2014 \u201dsome people did something\u201d \u2014 with footage from the terrorist attacks.\n\u201cShe\u2019s been very disrespectful to this country,\u201d Trump said of Omar. \u201cShe\u2019s been very disrespectful, frankly, to Israel. She is somebody that doesn\u2019t really understand, I think, life, real life.\u201d\nOmar, a former refugee who escaped Somalia\u2019s civil war, is one of only two Muslim women ever elected to Congress. She and her family spent four years at a refugee camp in Kenya before coming to the U.S. Numerous progressives and Democrats have defended Omar from Trump\u2019s attacks by saying that his rhetoric is encouraging violence against the congresswoman, her family, and other Muslim people.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cShe\u2019s got a way about her that\u2019s very, very bad, I think, for our country. I think she\u2019s extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country.\u201d\nSeparately, Trump spoke at a Tax Day event in Minnesota and took what some perceived to be a veiled shot at Somali immigrants, including Omar, in the state. A racist, Islamophobic conspiracy theory \u2014 referenced in a meme that has been retweeted by the president's son, Don Jr. \u2014 claims that President Barack Obama\u2019s refugee policies were a calculated effort to get Omar elected.\n\"I want to reiterate something that is different from what we are talking about today, but I think you have been treated extremely unfairly with respect to immigration,\u201d Trump said. \u201cExtremely unfairly. We are going to change that. We will change it.\"\nOmar is the most vocal critic of the Israeli government in Congress and among the most high-profile freshman members of the House. Republicans and some Democrats have accused Omar of anti-Semitism over her criticism of Israel, pro-Israel lobbyists, and Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. She has been targeted by numerous threats of violence since taking office. Earlier this month, the FBI arrested a man who allegedly called Omar\u2019s office and threatened to shoot her in the head.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi didn\u2019t directly defend Omar from Trump\u2019s attacks until Sunday. Pelosi said she'd spoken with the Capitol Police sergeant-at-arms to ensure that Omar was safe.\n\u201cThe president\u2019s words weigh a ton, and his hateful & inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger,\u201d Pelosi tweeted. \u201cPresident Trump must take down his disrespectful and dangerous video.\u201d\nPelosi herself has been subject to criticism over her handling of Trump\u2019s 9/11 video. On Tuesday, Pelosi deflected a question from CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour about whether she responded quickly enough to defend Omar.\n\"Well, I haven't had a chance to speak with her, I'm traveling,\" Pelosi said.\n\"I don't even know what was said,\u201d Pelosi added.\nCover: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a roundtable on the economy and tax reform at Nuss Trucking and Equipment on April 15, 2019 in Burnsville, Minnesota.

They followed a handful of Syrians fleeing the conflict to the town of Sa&rsquo;ad Nayel in Lebanon, just west of the border. There they set up a makeshift tent on open farmland, across from a small river.</p>\n<figure><picture> </picture></figure>\n<p>The plan was to stay there for a few months until the fighting died down. It&rsquo;s been seven years.</p>\n<p>Today, Jassem pays $100 a month to rent 200 square feet of property in a refugee camp known as 003. His family has grown by two, and he&rsquo;s drowning in debt, behind on three months of rent, barely earning any money with the few shifts of manual labor he&rsquo;s able to secure.</p>\n<p>Lebanon has more Syrian refugees per capita than any other country in the world &mdash; roughly 1.5 million. But the country, <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/d7faca02c8024f8da57ffa6987500e2d\">mired in its own crises</a>, has struggled to provide much in the way of lasting support to its neediest neighbors. Instead, many refugees like Jassem have grown weary of the poor living conditions and limited opportunities for work.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s gotten so bad that he&rsquo;s decided to do something he once thought unthinkable: take the Syrian government at its word and accept the plan announced last July to repatriate refugees.</p>\n<p>Parts of Syria may still be at war. Its infrastructure may be decimated. Jassem&rsquo;s home in Homs is certainly no longer there, flattened by Russian airstrikes just days after he fled. But he&rsquo;s joining 90,000 others Syrians who&rsquo;ve already gone back anyway, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>\n<p>In January, Jassem applied for one-way bus tickets home.</p>\n<figure><picture> </picture></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;We have had enough,&rdquo; he told VICE News. &ldquo;This is it now. We can't take any more. It's all bad here. Everything is sour in Lebanon. There's nothing that's good here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>VICE News traveled to Lebanon earlier this year to see how Syrian refugees are getting by, and to speak with those who&rsquo;ve decided to return home.</p>\n<figure><picture> </picture></figure>\n<figure><picture> </picture></figure>\n<figure><picture> </picture></figure>\n<figure><picture> </picture></figure>\n<p><i>Zach Caldwell filmed this segment and Joe Matoske edited.</i></p>\n<p><i>Cover image: The Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs says at least 90,000 Syrians have returned home since July.

They followed a handful of Syrians fleeing the conflict to the town of Sa\u2019ad Nayel in Lebanon, just west of the border. There they set up a makeshift tent on open farmland, across from a small river.\nThe plan was to stay there for a few months until the fighting died down. It\u2019s been seven years.\nToday, Jassem pays $100 a month to rent 200 square feet of property in a refugee camp known as 003. His family has grown by two, and he\u2019s drowning in debt, behind on three months of rent, barely earning any money with the few shifts of manual labor he\u2019s able to secure.\nLebanon has more Syrian refugees per capita than any other country in the world \u2014 roughly 1.5 million. But the country, mired in its own crises, has struggled to provide much in the way of lasting support to its neediest neighbors. Instead, many refugees like Jassem have grown weary of the poor living conditions and limited opportunities for work.\nIt\u2019s gotten so bad that he\u2019s decided to do something he once thought unthinkable: take the Syrian government at its word and accept the plan announced last July to repatriate refugees.\nParts of Syria may still be at war. Its infrastructure may be decimated. Jassem\u2019s home in Homs is certainly no longer there, flattened by Russian airstrikes just days after he fled. But he\u2019s joining 90,000 others Syrians who\u2019ve already gone back anyway, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nIn January, Jassem applied for one-way bus tickets home.\n\u201cWe have had enough,\u201d he told VICE News. \u201cThis is it now. We can't take any more. It's all bad here. Everything is sour in Lebanon. There's nothing that's good here.\u201d\nVICE News traveled to Lebanon earlier this year to see how Syrian refugees are getting by, and to speak with those who\u2019ve decided to return home.\nZach Caldwell filmed this segment and Joe Matoske edited.\nCover image: The Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs says at least 90,000 Syrians have returned home since July.

The feds knew about the $83,333 he&rsquo;d been getting paid every month in consulting fees by a firm linked to a billionaire Russian oligarch widely seen as close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and they had reviewed a lengthy paper trail covering Cohen&rsquo;s suspicious statements to banks.</p>\n<p>Only later, according to the documents, while investigating those issues, did investigators find evidence Cohen had also arranged illegal hush-money payments, in the middle of the 2016 campaign, to women claiming they&rsquo;d slept with Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>New search-warrant records unsealed Tuesday reveal that special counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s office began probing President Trump&rsquo;s former attorney almost a year earlier than has been previously acknowledged, with an early emphasis on a series of sketchy foreign consulting payments and Cohen&rsquo;s personal finances.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/CJ5HdH0?app=1&lazy=1&v=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>The new documents change the public timeline of Mueller&rsquo;s Russia investigation by showing an intense, early focus on Cohen&rsquo;s money, one that later blossomed into other charges of campaign finance violations.</p>\n<p>The documents help explain why Cohen eventually split off from Trump &mdash; the boss he&rsquo;d once vowed he&rsquo;d take a bullet for &mdash; by underscoring just how much pressure Cohen was under from criminal prosecutors by the time he eventually pleaded guilty and began cooperating in August 2018.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think Mueller&rsquo;s office would have looked at these payments and wondered whether they were part of the bigger picture of Russian involvement in the 2016 election,&rdquo; said Charles A. Intriago, a former federal prosecutor and an expert on money laundering. &ldquo;And my view is that they were indeed part of a broader Russian strategy to get closer to Cohen and to the administration.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>An impressive pile of evidence had already been stacked up against him, even before FBI agents raided his apartment, office, hotel room, and safe deposit box in April 2018, in the moment when the investigation into Cohen burst into public view.</p>\n<h2> Cohen's foreign money</h2>\n<p>The new documents reveal Mueller investigated Cohen over a host of potential crimes that were never actually charged &mdash; including operating as an unregistered agent of a foreign government, potential money laundering, and wire fraud.</p>\n<p>FBI agents working with Mueller obtained their first warrant on a Gmail account used by Cohen in July 2017, just two months after Mueller was appointed to investigate Trump&rsquo;s links to Russia that May.</p>\n<p>They took out two more warrants on Cohen&rsquo;s email and iCloud accounts in August and November.</p>\n<p>While probing foreign payments and suspect loan applications, investigators &ldquo;obtained evidence that Mr. Cohen had also committed a criminal violation of campaign finance laws,&rdquo; the April 2018 documents say. Materials found in those inquiries were sent to prosecutors in Manhattan in February 2018.</p>\n<p>Cohen ultimately pleaded guilty to eight counts of financial crimes brought by the Southern District of New York, including six related to his personal finances. He also pleaded guilty to two more counts relating to campaign finance violations stemming from the hush-money payments.</p>\n<p>The documents don&rsquo;t specify which foreign government Mueller first suspected Cohen might be working for.</p>\n<p>But they do say investigators knew Cohen had received some $3 million in fishy-looking payments, including from foreign businesses, just days after then-boss entered the White House.</p>\n<p>Other press reports have recounted how Cohen, who wasn&rsquo;t given a job in the Trump administration, pitched himself as an advisor to outsiders attempting to understand the new president, and signed contracts for hefty consulting fees.</p>\n<p>The new documents recount how Cohen began receiving payments from an investment company linked to Russian <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/8xe45p/who-is-viktor-vekselberg-the-russian-oligarch-who-gave-dollar500k-to-trumps-lawyer-michael-cohen\">billionaire oligarch Viktor Vekselberg</a> on roughly January 31, 2017, just 11 days after Trump was sworn into office. The Russia-linked investment company, Columbus Nova LLC, paid Cohen a total of $583,332 in monthly installments of $83,333, the documents say.</p>\n<p>Investigators also noted that Cohen took $600,000 from Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd., a South Korean weapons-maker. At the time, the firm was trying to score a $16 billion jet fighter contract from the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>Swiss drug-maker Novartis and U.S. telecom AT&amp;T also paid Cohen hefty consulting fees.</p>\n<p>Investigators saw that money flow as highly suspect, and noted that they didn&rsquo;t look like simple real estate consulting payments that Cohen had told the bank his account would be used for.</p>\n<p>The payments &ldquo;do not reflect the stated profile for the residential and commercial real-estate consulting services,&rdquo; an FBI special agent wrote in one of the documents in April 2018.</p>\n<p>Columbus Nova would later insist<a href=\"http://columbusnova.com/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosprorata&stream=top-stories\"> in a statement that it had retained Cohen&rsquo;s services</a> &ldquo;as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures.&rdquo; AT&amp;T would say the payments were aimed at tapping Cohen&rsquo;s insights about Trump, and &ldquo;understanding the new administration.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The documents say Cohen ultimately used those payments for personal expenses, including paying his fees at the Core Club, one of New York&rsquo;s swankiest private clubs, where admission alone reportedly costs $50,000, in addition so some $17,000 in annual fees.</p>\n<h2> The $100 million man</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately for Cohen, those foreign payments weren&rsquo;t the only red flags spotted by investigators.</p>\n<p>The hundreds of pages unsealed on Tuesday recount in detail Cohen&rsquo;s dealings with his banks that raised suspicions.</p>\n<p>At one point, Cohen listed his own personal assets as topping $100 million, according to the documents, while he was in the process of taking out a loan. Just a short time later, he seemed to be having trouble making his loan payments.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Cohen would plead guilty to one count of making false statements to a bank &mdash; after a bewildering cycle of loans and refinancings among three different banks, all made while his once-profitable investments in the taxi cab industry were imploding under the threat from ride-sharing apps.</p>\n<p>In the course of investigating all those activities, investigators also found evidence that Cohen had violated campaign finance laws during the 2016 campaign.</p>\n<p>Yet the details of how much prosecutors for the Southern District of New York knew about those hush-money payments at the moment of the raid on Cohen&rsquo;s properties in April 2018 remains unclear.</p>\n<p>In a sign that the investigation into those payments is still very much underway, several pages relating to campaign finance violations were fully redacted in the documents released on Tuesday.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/nrJDKO9?app=1&lazy=1&v=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><i>Cover image: Michael Cohen, former personal attorney for U.S. President Donald Trump, exits the Loews Regency hotel and walks toward a taxi cab, July 27, 2018 in New York City.

                "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Long before FBI agents arrived at his door in April 2018, Michael Cohen was in deep trouble with the law.\nFederal officials had been investigating Cohen for nearly a year \u2014 since July 2017 \u2014 over a laundry list of possible crimes. The feds knew about the $83,333 he\u2019d been getting paid every month in consulting fees by a firm linked to a billionaire Russian oligarch widely seen as close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and they had reviewed a lengthy paper trail covering Cohen\u2019s suspicious statements to banks.\nOnly later, according to the documents, while investigating those issues, did investigators find evidence Cohen had also arranged illegal hush-money payments, in the middle of the 2016 campaign, to women claiming they\u2019d slept with Donald Trump.\nNew search-warrant records unsealed Tuesday reveal that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office began probing President Trump\u2019s former attorney almost a year earlier than has been previously acknowledged, with an early emphasis on a series of sketchy foreign consulting payments and Cohen\u2019s personal finances.\nThe new documents change the public timeline of Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation by showing an intense, early focus on Cohen\u2019s money, one that later blossomed into other charges of campaign finance violations.\nThe documents help explain why Cohen eventually split off from Trump \u2014 the boss he\u2019d once vowed he\u2019d take a bullet for \u2014 by underscoring just how much pressure Cohen was under from criminal prosecutors by the time he eventually pleaded guilty and began cooperating in August 2018.\n\u201cI think Mueller\u2019s office would have looked at these payments and wondered whether they were part of the bigger picture of Russian involvement in the 2016 election,\u201d said Charles A. Intriago, a former federal prosecutor and an expert on money laundering. \u201cAnd my view is that they were indeed part of a broader Russian strategy to get closer to Cohen and to the administration.\u201d\nAn impressive pile of evidence had already been stacked up against him, even before FBI agents raided his apartment, office, hotel room, and safe deposit box in April 2018, in the moment when the investigation into Cohen burst into public view.\nCohen's foreign money\nThe new documents reveal Mueller investigated Cohen over a host of potential crimes that were never actually charged \u2014 including operating as an unregistered agent of a foreign government, potential money laundering, and wire fraud.\nFBI agents working with Mueller obtained their first warrant on a Gmail account used by Cohen in July 2017, just two months after Mueller was appointed to investigate Trump\u2019s links to Russia that May.\nThey took out two more warrants on Cohen\u2019s email and iCloud accounts in August and November.\nWhile probing foreign payments and suspect loan applications, investigators \u201cobtained evidence that Mr. Cohen had also committed a criminal violation of campaign finance laws,\u201d the April 2018 documents say. Materials found in those inquiries were sent to prosecutors in Manhattan in February 2018.\nCohen ultimately pleaded guilty to eight counts of financial crimes brought by the Southern District of New York, including six related to his personal finances. He also pleaded guilty to two more counts relating to campaign finance violations stemming from the hush-money payments.\nThe documents don\u2019t specify which foreign government Mueller first suspected Cohen might be working for.\nBut they do say investigators knew Cohen had received some $3 million in fishy-looking payments, including from foreign businesses, just days after then-boss entered the White House.\nOther press reports have recounted how Cohen, who wasn\u2019t given a job in the Trump administration, pitched himself as an advisor to outsiders attempting to understand the new president, and signed contracts for hefty consulting fees.\nThe new documents recount how Cohen began receiving payments from an investment company linked to Russian billionaire oligarch Viktor Vekselberg on roughly January 31, 2017, just 11 days after Trump was sworn into office. The Russia-linked investment company, Columbus Nova LLC, paid Cohen a total of $583,332 in monthly installments of $83,333, the documents say.\nInvestigators also noted that Cohen took $600,000 from Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd., a South Korean weapons-maker. At the time, the firm was trying to score a $16 billion jet fighter contract from the Trump administration.\nSwiss drug-maker Novartis and U.S. telecom AT&T also paid Cohen hefty consulting fees.\nInvestigators saw that money flow as highly suspect, and noted that they didn\u2019t look like simple real estate consulting payments that Cohen had told the bank his account would be used for.\nThe payments \u201cdo not reflect the stated profile for the residential and commercial real-estate consulting services,\u201d an FBI special agent wrote in one of the documents in April 2018.\nColumbus Nova would later insist in a statement that it had retained Cohen\u2019s services \u201cas a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures.\u201d AT&T would say the payments were aimed at tapping Cohen\u2019s insights about Trump, and \u201cunderstanding the new administration.\u201d\nThe documents say Cohen ultimately used those payments for personal expenses, including paying his fees at the Core Club, one of New York\u2019s swankiest private clubs, where admission alone reportedly costs $50,000, in addition so some $17,000 in annual fees.\nThe $100 million man\nUnfortunately for Cohen, those foreign payments weren\u2019t the only red flags spotted by investigators.\nThe hundreds of pages unsealed on Tuesday recount in detail Cohen\u2019s dealings with his banks that raised suspicions.\nAt one point, Cohen listed his own personal assets as topping $100 million, according to the documents, while he was in the process of taking out a loan. Just a short time later, he seemed to be having trouble making his loan payments.\nUltimately, Cohen would plead guilty to one count of making false statements to a bank \u2014 after a bewildering cycle of loans and refinancings among three different banks, all made while his once-profitable investments in the taxi cab industry were imploding under the threat from ride-sharing apps.\nIn the course of investigating all those activities, investigators also found evidence that Cohen had violated campaign finance laws during the 2016 campaign.\nYet the details of how much prosecutors for the Southern District of New York knew about those hush-money payments at the moment of the raid on Cohen\u2019s properties in April 2018 remains unclear.\nIn a sign that the investigation into those payments is still very much underway, several pages relating to campaign finance violations were fully redacted in the documents released on Tuesday.\nCover image: Michael Cohen, former personal attorney for U.S. President Donald Trump, exits the Loews Regency hotel and walks toward a taxi cab, July 27, 2018 in New York City.

And he&rsquo;s bringing a basketful of Trump&rsquo;s dirtiest laundry with him.</p>\n<p>Cohen is expected to accuse Trump of engaging in criminal activity after taking office, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/us/politics/michael-cohen-testimony.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage\">The New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/cohen-to-testify-that-trump-engaged-in-criminal-conduct-while-in-office-11551175201?mod=hp_lead_pos1\">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported Tuesday, citing a person familiar with Cohen&rsquo;s plans. Cohen&rsquo;s also expected to detail alleged instances in which Trump used racist language and lied about the size of his fortune. And he&rsquo;s reportedly going to bring along documents.</p>\n<p>After a decade by Trump&rsquo;s side, during which he&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/michael-cohen-gets-3-years-cases-involving-stormy-daniels-lying-n946956\">said</a> he covered up Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;dirty deeds,&rdquo; Cohen split from his former boss last year and committed to speaking out publicly about what he knows. After pleading guilty to a smorgasbord of crimes, including campaign finance violations and previously lying to Congress, he&rsquo;s returning to the Hill and pledging to tell it straight this time.</p>\n<p>As Cohen begins his intense tour of the hearing rooms of Capitol Hill, here are five things you need to know.</p>\n<h2> 1. A focus on Trump&rsquo;s money</h2>\n<p>Cohen is expected to have a lot to say about Trump&rsquo;s business practices, including occasions he may have strayed onto the shadier side.</p>\n<p>The House Oversight Committee has said Cohen will speak about Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;debts and payments relating to efforts to influence the 2016 election&rdquo; and his &ldquo;compliance with tax laws.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress when he said that attempts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign ended in January 2016. Instead, he admitted that the discussions were more extensive and prolonged.</p>\n<p>Cohen said in November that he&rsquo;d had a previously undisclosed phone call with a Kremlin aide in early 2016, during which he sought the Russian government&rsquo;s help securing land and financing for the deal. And he said that he&rsquo;d briefed Trump about the project on more than the three occasions he&rsquo;d previously acknowledged.</p>\n<p>Cohen has admitted that discussions aimed at winning government approval for the project continued until at least June 2016. And he&rsquo;s planning to tell members of Congress that Trump continued to inquire about the project past January 2016, a source told the Journal.</p>\n<p>Cohen is expected to shed more light on those lies &mdash; but isn&rsquo;t expected to say whether Trump directed him to misstate the facts, a person familiar with Wednesday&rsquo;s planned testimony told the WSJ.</p>\n<p>Neither the White House nor Cohen&rsquo;s attorney, Lanny Davis, returned a request for comment from VICE News on Tuesday.</p>\n<h2> 2. Campaign finance shenanigans</h2>\n<p>Cohen worked for Trump for a decade and has admitted to helping cover up damaging information about his former boss during the run-up to the 2016 election. Cohen pleaded guilty last August to helping arrange hush-money payments to two women claiming they&rsquo;d had affairs with Trump during the campaign.</p>\n<p>In August, Cohen implicated Trump in directing those payments. In December, federal prosecutors in New York backed him up and said that the payments were made &ldquo;at the direction of&rdquo; Trump.</p>\n<p>This week, Cohen will give a detailed account of how those payments went down, according to both the Times and the Journal.</p>\n<p>Cohen will also assert that Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was involved in those efforts, the person familiar with Cohen&rsquo;s planned testimony told the WSJ. Weisselberg has reportedly been granted immunity and has testified before a grand jury.</p>\n<h2> 3. Trump&rsquo;s alleged racist statements</h2>\n<p>Cohen&rsquo;s testimony will also reportedly include stories about Trump making racist comments &mdash; an allegation that&rsquo;s been made in the past.</p>\n<p>Cohen told <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/michael-cohen-trump-racist-language\">Vanity Fair</a> in November that Trump repeatedly used racist language. In one example, he told the magazine about a conversation he once had with Trump in the late 2000s, when the two men were driving through Chicago together.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We were going from the airport to the hotel, and we drove through what looked like a rougher neighborhood,&rdquo; the magazine quoted Cohen as sayin. &ldquo;Trump made a comment to me, saying only blacks could live like this.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cohen wouldn&rsquo;t be the first former Trump official to accuse him of making racist comments. Omarosa Manigault Newman, a contestant on Trump&rsquo;s reality TV show and later a White House aide, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/10/omarosa-trump-book-the-apprentice-memoir\">accused</a> Trump of using the &ldquo;n-word.&rdquo; Manigault <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/12/omarosa-manigault-newman-trump-tape-n-word\">said</a> a tape exists that would prove it &mdash; although, as with Cohen, her credibility has been <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/white-house-calls-omarosa-a-liar-over-allegations-in-new-book-d0371eb5-760d-485e-a3a1-5548ca2a0c0d.html\">challenged</a> by the White House and Trump&rsquo;s defenders.</p>\n<p>Trump has also routinely been accused of using slanted speech when discussing foreign policy. For example, he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-protections-for-immigrants-from-shithole-countries-in-oval-office-meeting/2018/01/11/bfc0725c-f711-11e7-91af-31ac729add94_story.html?utm_term=.347a85aa4281\">infamously referred</a> to immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries as coming from &ldquo;shithole countries.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2> 4. No Russia probe stuff in public </h2>\n<p>Of Cohen&rsquo;s three Congressional gigs this week, only one will be televised: Wednesday&rsquo;s appearance before the House Oversight Committee. The other two will take place behind closed doors: Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee.</p>\n<p>Cohen&rsquo;s public testimony on Wednesday will not include any questions about Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election, the House Oversight Committee leadership said in<a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/2019-02-20%20Oversight%20Committee%20Hearing%20Memo%20re.%20Michael%20Cohen.pdf\"> a memo released</a> last week.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/OicMmCI?app=1&lazy=1&v=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Instead, the memo said Cohen&rsquo;s day of public testimony will focus on:</p>\n<ul><li>Trump&rsquo;s debts and payments relating to efforts to influence the 2016 Election</li><li>Trump&rsquo;s compliance with financial disclosure requirements</li><li>Trump&rsquo;s compliance with campaign finance laws</li><li>Trump&rsquo;s compliance with tax laws</li><li>Trump&rsquo;s business practices</li><li>Potentially fraudulent or inappropriate practices by the Trump Foundation</li></ul>\n<h2> 5. The return of a known liar</h2>\n<p>Republicans on all three committees will have their own list of questions for Trump&rsquo;s longtime attorney and will likely try to throw him off his game.

                "text": "Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s estranged former attorney and \u201cfixer,\u201d begins three days hotly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. And he\u2019s bringing a basketful of Trump\u2019s dirtiest laundry with him.\nCohen is expected to accuse Trump of engaging in criminal activity after taking office, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing a person familiar with Cohen\u2019s plans. Cohen\u2019s also expected to detail alleged instances in which Trump used racist language and lied about the size of his fortune. And he\u2019s reportedly going to bring along documents.\nAfter a decade by Trump\u2019s side, during which he\u2019s said he covered up Trump\u2019s \u201cdirty deeds,\u201d Cohen split from his former boss last year and committed to speaking out publicly about what he knows. After pleading guilty to a smorgasbord of crimes, including campaign finance violations and previously lying to Congress, he\u2019s returning to the Hill and pledging to tell it straight this time.\nAs Cohen begins his intense tour of the hearing rooms of Capitol Hill, here are five things you need to know.\n1. A focus on Trump\u2019s money\nCohen is expected to have a lot to say about Trump\u2019s business practices, including occasions he may have strayed onto the shadier side.\nThe House Oversight Committee has said Cohen will speak about Trump\u2019s \u201cdebts and payments relating to efforts to influence the 2016 election\u201d and his \u201ccompliance with tax laws.\u201d\nIn November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress when he said that attempts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign ended in January 2016. Instead, he admitted that the discussions were more extensive and prolonged.\nCohen said in November that he\u2019d had a previously undisclosed phone call with a Kremlin aide in early 2016, during which he sought the Russian government\u2019s help securing land and financing for the deal. And he said that he\u2019d briefed Trump about the project on more than the three occasions he\u2019d previously acknowledged.\nCohen has admitted that discussions aimed at winning government approval for the project continued until at least June 2016. And he\u2019s planning to tell members of Congress that Trump continued to inquire about the project past January 2016, a source told the Journal.\nCohen is expected to shed more light on those lies \u2014 but isn\u2019t expected to say whether Trump directed him to misstate the facts, a person familiar with Wednesday\u2019s planned testimony told the WSJ.\nNeither the White House nor Cohen\u2019s attorney, Lanny Davis, returned a request for comment from VICE News on Tuesday.\n2. Campaign finance shenanigans\nCohen worked for Trump for a decade and has admitted to helping cover up damaging information about his former boss during the run-up to the 2016 election. Cohen pleaded guilty last August to helping arrange hush-money payments to two women claiming they\u2019d had affairs with Trump during the campaign.\nIn August, Cohen implicated Trump in directing those payments. In December, federal prosecutors in New York backed him up and said that the payments were made \u201cat the direction of\u201d Trump.\nThis week, Cohen will give a detailed account of how those payments went down, according to both the Times and the Journal.\nCohen will also assert that Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was involved in those efforts, the person familiar with Cohen\u2019s planned testimony told the WSJ. Weisselberg has reportedly been granted immunity and has testified before a grand jury.\n3. Trump\u2019s alleged racist statements\nCohen\u2019s testimony will also reportedly include stories about Trump making racist comments \u2014 an allegation that\u2019s been made in the past.\nCohen told Vanity Fair in November that Trump repeatedly used racist language. In one example, he told the magazine about a conversation he once had with Trump in the late 2000s, when the two men were driving through Chicago together.\n\u201cWe were going from the airport to the hotel, and we drove through what looked like a rougher neighborhood,\u201d the magazine quoted Cohen as sayin. \u201cTrump made a comment to me, saying only blacks could live like this.\u201d\nCohen wouldn\u2019t be the first former Trump official to accuse him of making racist comments. Omarosa Manigault Newman, a contestant on Trump\u2019s reality TV show and later a White House aide, accused Trump of using the \u201cn-word.\u201d Manigault said a tape exists that would prove it \u2014 although, as with Cohen, her credibility has been challenged by the White House and Trump\u2019s defenders.\nTrump has also routinely been accused of using slanted speech when discussing foreign policy. For example, he infamously referred to immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries as coming from \u201cshithole countries.\u201d\n4. No Russia probe stuff in public\nOf Cohen\u2019s three Congressional gigs this week, only one will be televised: Wednesday\u2019s appearance before the House Oversight Committee. The other two will take place behind closed doors: Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee.\nCohen\u2019s public testimony on Wednesday will not include any questions about Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election, the House Oversight Committee leadership said in a memo released last week.\nInstead, the memo said Cohen\u2019s day of public testimony will focus on:\nTrump\u2019s debts and payments relating to efforts to influence the 2016 Election\nTrump\u2019s compliance with financial disclosure requirements\nTrump\u2019s compliance with campaign finance laws\nTrump\u2019s compliance with tax laws\nTrump\u2019s business practices\nPotentially fraudulent or inappropriate practices by the Trump Foundation\n5. The return of a known liar\nRepublicans on all three committees will have their own list of questions for Trump\u2019s longtime attorney and will likely try to throw him off his game. They have already signaled they\u2019ll point to Cohen\u2019s acknowledged history of lying to show that his new allegations shouldn\u2019t be believed either.\nOhio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, the top-ranking Republican on the House Oversight Committee, called holding a hearing with an \u201cadmitted liar\u201d part of a Democratic attempt to kickstart impeachment proceedings against Trump.\n\u201cI am disappointed and disheartened that Chairman [Elijah] Cummings\u2019s first major hearing will feature Michael Cohen as phase one of the Democrats\u2019 coordinated campaign to remove the President from office,\u201d Jordan said in a statement. \u201cGiving a platform to Mr. Cohen is beneath the dignity of the Congress.\u201d\nTrump has also accused his former lawyer of making up stories in an effort to reduce his own prison time.\nCover image: Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer, arrives to testify before a closed door hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, Feb. 26, 2019, in Washington.

The DNC has refused to partner with Fox News on debates, declaring the network unable to give Democratic 2020 candidates fair coverage.</p>\n<p>But the audience at Sanders&rsquo; Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, town hall seemed enthused by a lot of what the Vermont Democratic Socialist had to say.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the audience even appeared to surprise Fox News host Bret Baier, frequently erupting into applause for Sanders and his ideas. Fox News described the crowd as a &ldquo;mixed audience:&rdquo; The conservative news channel selected attendees through outreach to political and local groups and by mining requests to attend.</p>\n<p>In the town hall&rsquo;s most striking moment, Baier, perhaps inadvertently, revealed just how popular Sanders&rsquo; policy ideas were with Fox&rsquo;s hand-picked crowd. Baier asked the audience to raise their hands if they get their insurance through their employer or a private insurer.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And of those, how many of you are willing to transition to what the senator says, a government-run system?&rdquo; Baier said, a reference to Medicare for All, Sanders&rsquo; plan to provide health insurance to every American through a government program.</p>\n<p>Most of the audience raised their hands and cheered.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/gGOTfvx?app=1&lazy=1&v=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Medicare for All &mdash; which was <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/9kx9ny/bernies-latest-medicare-for-all-bill-has-a-key-difference-from-his-last-one\">reintroduced in the Senate last week</a> &mdash; would functionally abolish the private-insurance industry by outlawing private insurers from offering coverage that Medicare for All provides, which is extensive.</p>\n<p>The crowd&rsquo;s enthusiastic response was one of many moments of triumph for Sanders during the evening&rsquo;s town hall. It was such a positive moment for Sanders that even President Trump noticed, speculating Tuesday morning that the audience was stacked in Sanders&rsquo; favor.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/YdP5XLI?app=1&lazy=1&v=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>In another standout moment, the audience jeered Baier when he criticized Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has been repeatedly accused of anti-Semitism as a result of her criticism of the Israeli government. Over the weekend, right-wing politicians and media pundits attacked Omar over <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/neajxd/ilhan-omar-targeted-with-racist-insults-and-conspiracy-theories-over-911-comments\">her use of the words &ldquo;some people did something&rdquo; to describe the New York City terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001</a>. Trump tweeted a video that juxtaposed Omar&rsquo;s words with footage of 9/11, which Omar said led to a spike in direct threats on her life.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hold it, hold it, hold it,&rdquo; Sanders said when asked about his &ldquo;staunch&rdquo; support of Omar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked to Ilhan about twice in my life. I respect her, but this is what I do support: I support a Muslim member of Congress not to be attacked every single day in outrageous, racist remarks.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sanders, who is Jewish, went on to say it's not anti-Semitic to criticize Israel&rsquo;s government.</p>\n<p>&quot;I will do everything in my power, and I hope that every member of Congress will fight not only anti-Semitism, but racism and anti-Muslim activity so that we create a nondiscriminatory society,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;But it is not anti-Semitic to be critical of a right-wing government in Israel. That is not anti-Semitic.&quot;</p>\n<p>During the town hall, Sanders led a call-and-response and rattled off numerous of his agenda items. The audience cheered when asked if they agreed with Sanders&rsquo; proposals.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/HXYHTgX?app=1&lazy=1&v=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Sanders&rsquo; campaign staff &mdash; including his campaign manager Faiz Shakir and press secretary Briahna Joy Gray &mdash; both hailed the town hall as a triumph for Sanders.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/iGjRKVY?app=1&lazy=1&v=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/RhKAlVB?app=1&lazy=1&v=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Sanders&rsquo; success on Fox News is particularly notable because the Democratic National <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/panjxm/when-bernie-went-on-fox-news-in-2016-he-kinda-killed-it\">Committee said in March that it would not partner with the</a> network to host any Democratic primary debates after a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-making-of-the-fox-news-white-house\">New Yorker report</a> detailed how the network not only supported then-candidate Trump but sought to suppress negative coverage of him during the 2016 campaign.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The network is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates,&rdquo; DNC head Tom Perez said in March.</p>\n<p>But if Sanders&rsquo; town hall is any indication, there&rsquo;s still some opportunity for Democrats to have a positive experience on Fox News.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/UWvO5wx?img=1&lazy=1&v=1&app=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/UWvO5wx/thumbnail\"></img></figure>\n<p><i>Cover: U.S. Sen.

                "text": "Bernie Sanders just got some of his best campaign press ever \u2014 on Fox News.\nSanders held a town hall on Fox News Monday evening, breaking with the Democratic National Committee to appear on the conservative network. The DNC has refused to partner with Fox News on debates, declaring the network unable to give Democratic 2020 candidates fair coverage.\nBut the audience at Sanders\u2019 Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, town hall seemed enthused by a lot of what the Vermont Democratic Socialist had to say.\nIndeed, the audience even appeared to surprise Fox News host Bret Baier, frequently erupting into applause for Sanders and his ideas. Fox News described the crowd as a \u201cmixed audience:\u201d The conservative news channel selected attendees through outreach to political and local groups and by mining requests to attend.\nIn the town hall\u2019s most striking moment, Baier, perhaps inadvertently, revealed just how popular Sanders\u2019 policy ideas were with Fox\u2019s hand-picked crowd. Baier asked the audience to raise their hands if they get their insurance through their employer or a private insurer.\n\u201cAnd of those, how many of you are willing to transition to what the senator says, a government-run system?\u201d Baier said, a reference to Medicare for All, Sanders\u2019 plan to provide health insurance to every American through a government program.\nMost of the audience raised their hands and cheered.\nMedicare for All \u2014 which was reintroduced in the Senate last week \u2014 would functionally abolish the private-insurance industry by outlawing private insurers from offering coverage that Medicare for All provides, which is extensive.\nThe crowd\u2019s enthusiastic response was one of many moments of triumph for Sanders during the evening\u2019s town hall. It was such a positive moment for Sanders that even President Trump noticed, speculating Tuesday morning that the audience was stacked in Sanders\u2019 favor.\nIn another standout moment, the audience jeered Baier when he criticized Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has been repeatedly accused of anti-Semitism as a result of her criticism of the Israeli government. Over the weekend, right-wing politicians and media pundits attacked Omar over her use of the words \u201csome people did something\u201d to describe the New York City terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Trump tweeted a video that juxtaposed Omar\u2019s words with footage of 9/11, which Omar said led to a spike in direct threats on her life.\n\u201cHold it, hold it, hold it,\u201d Sanders said when asked about his \u201cstaunch\u201d support of Omar. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to Ilhan about twice in my life. I respect her, but this is what I do support: I support a Muslim member of Congress not to be attacked every single day in outrageous, racist remarks.\u201d\nSanders, who is Jewish, went on to say it's not anti-Semitic to criticize Israel\u2019s government.\n\"I will do everything in my power, and I hope that every member of Congress will fight not only anti-Semitism, but racism and anti-Muslim activity so that we create a nondiscriminatory society,\" Sanders said. \"But it is not anti-Semitic to be critical of a right-wing government in Israel. That is not anti-Semitic.\"\nDuring the town hall, Sanders led a call-and-response and rattled off numerous of his agenda items. The audience cheered when asked if they agreed with Sanders\u2019 proposals.\nSanders\u2019 campaign staff \u2014 including his campaign manager Faiz Shakir and press secretary Briahna Joy Gray \u2014 both hailed the town hall as a triumph for Sanders.\nSanders\u2019 success on Fox News is particularly notable because the Democratic National Committee said in March that it would not partner with the network to host any Democratic primary debates after a New Yorker report detailed how the network not only supported then-candidate Trump but sought to suppress negative coverage of him during the 2016 campaign.\n\u201cThe network is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates,\u201d DNC head Tom Perez said in March.\nBut if Sanders\u2019 town hall is any indication, there\u2019s still some opportunity for Democrats to have a positive experience on Fox News.\nCover: U.S. Sen.

During the hearing, Rep. Pramila Jayapal asked Lloyd, &ldquo;Did you ever say to the administration, &lsquo;This is a bad idea. Here&rsquo;s what my child welfare experts have told us. We need to stop this policy&rsquo;? Did you once say that to anybody above you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To answer your question, I did not say those words,&rdquo; Lloyd told the California Democrat.</p>\n<p>Until last fall, Lloyd served as the head of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is tasked with reuniting separated children. During the same hearing, Jonathan White, a career official who previously worked as the deputy director of children&rsquo;s programs at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, said he warned Lloyd and other officials against separating families &mdash; repeatedly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I raised concerns about that both as regards to the effect on children and also the effect on the capacity of the program to serve children, and particularly very young children,&rdquo; testified White, who sat next to Lloyd. &ldquo;I raised those issues on a number of occasions primarily prior to Mr. Lloyd&rsquo;s arrival and also after his arrival.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>White, who is also a clinical social worker, said it was February 2017 when he first told officials that he was worried about any policy that would separate families. Once the agency started receiving reports that families were being split up at the border, in late summer 2017, White once again raised concerns.</p>\n<p>At that point, though, &ldquo;It was our understanding that there was no policy to affect separations,&rdquo; White said.</p>\n<p>In early February, <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/evev87/trump-official-helping-oversee-migrant-shelters-says-he-found-out-about-zero-tolerance-policy-on-tv\">White also told Congress during testimony</a> that he finally learned that family separations were, indeed, going on when he saw it on TV. He ended up helping lead reunification efforts.</p>\n<p>For months, congressional lawmakers and activists have sought to make Lloyd, who now works at an office that handles faith-based initiatives within the Department of Health and Human Services, speak about his role in the family separation crisis. On the infrequent occasions on which Lloyd spoke at all during the Tuesday hearing, he spoke quietly and often fumbled when attempting to clarify how the Office of Refugee Resettlement was tracking separated families or how the office prepared for the policy.</p>\n<p>At one point, after questioning from Jayapal, Lloyd said, &ldquo;I never directed anybody to not plan,&rdquo; Lloyd said. &ldquo;We &mdash; &rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t direct anybody to not plan,&rdquo; Japayal interrupted, &ldquo;and you didn&rsquo;t direct anybody to plan &mdash; &rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. That&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; Lloyd said, though he didn&rsquo;t explain as Jayapal kept speaking.</p>\n<p>At another point, Jayapal asked Lloyd, &ldquo;When Commander White, as a child welfare expert, warned you about the cruel consequences of family separation, were you concerned? Yes or no is fine.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I accepted what he told me,&rdquo; Lloyd said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So you were concerned?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He reported what the consequences would be, and I listened to him,&rdquo; Lloyd replied.</p>\n<p><i>Cover image: Senior adviser for Department of Health and Human Services Scott Lloyd testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on the Trump administration's separation policy involving migrant families on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 26, 2019.

                "text": "Scott Lloyd, the Trump appointee once in charge of caring for unaccompanied migrant children, told Congress Tuesday that he never cautioned the Trump administration that separating families at the border could leave children with potentially lifelong damage to their health.\nThe House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on Tuesday regarding the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, which split thousands of children from their families. During the hearing, Rep. Pramila Jayapal asked Lloyd, \u201cDid you ever say to the administration, \u2018This is a bad idea. Here\u2019s what my child welfare experts have told us. We need to stop this policy\u2019? Did you once say that to anybody above you?\u201d\n\u201cTo answer your question, I did not say those words,\u201d Lloyd told the California Democrat.\nUntil last fall, Lloyd served as the head of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is tasked with reuniting separated children. During the same hearing, Jonathan White, a career official who previously worked as the deputy director of children\u2019s programs at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, said he warned Lloyd and other officials against separating families \u2014 repeatedly.\n\u201cI raised concerns about that both as regards to the effect on children and also the effect on the capacity of the program to serve children, and particularly very young children,\u201d testified White, who sat next to Lloyd. \u201cI raised those issues on a number of occasions primarily prior to Mr. Lloyd\u2019s arrival and also after his arrival.\u201d\nWhite, who is also a clinical social worker, said it was February 2017 when he first told officials that he was worried about any policy that would separate families. Once the agency started receiving reports that families were being split up at the border, in late summer 2017, White once again raised concerns.\nAt that point, though, \u201cIt was our understanding that there was no policy to affect separations,\u201d White said.\nIn early February, White also told Congress during testimony that he finally learned that family separations were, indeed, going on when he saw it on TV. He ended up helping lead reunification efforts.\nFor months, congressional lawmakers and activists have sought to make Lloyd, who now works at an office that handles faith-based initiatives within the Department of Health and Human Services, speak about his role in the family separation crisis. On the infrequent occasions on which Lloyd spoke at all during the Tuesday hearing, he spoke quietly and often fumbled when attempting to clarify how the Office of Refugee Resettlement was tracking separated families or how the office prepared for the policy.\nAt one point, after questioning from Jayapal, Lloyd said, \u201cI never directed anybody to not plan,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cWe \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t direct anybody to not plan,\u201d Japayal interrupted, \u201cand you didn\u2019t direct anybody to plan \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Lloyd said, though he didn\u2019t explain as Jayapal kept speaking.\nAt another point, Jayapal asked Lloyd, \u201cWhen Commander White, as a child welfare expert, warned you about the cruel consequences of family separation, were you concerned? Yes or no is fine.\u201d\n\u201cI accepted what he told me,\u201d Lloyd said.\n\u201cSo you were concerned?\u201d\n\u201cHe reported what the consequences would be, and I listened to him,\u201d Lloyd replied.\nCover image: Senior adviser for Department of Health and Human Services Scott Lloyd testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on the Trump administration's separation policy involving migrant families on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 26, 2019.

Edwin Hardeman, 70, was the second plaintiff to go to trial out of thousands around the country who claim the weed killer causes cancer.</p>\n<p>Monsanto says studies have established that Roundup's active ingredient, glyphosate, is safe.</p>\n<p>A San Francisco jury in August awarded another man $289 million after determining Roundup caused his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A judge later slashed the award to $78 million, and Monsanto has appealed.</p>\n<p>Hardeman's trial is before a different judge and may be more significant. U.S. Judge Vince Chhabria is overseeing hundreds of Roundup lawsuits and has deemed Hardeman's case and two others &quot;bellwether trials.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Aspirin is out:</strong><a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/03/19/aspirin-heart-attack-stroke-diet-exercise-recommendations/3209612002/\">Here's how healthy older adults can prevent heart attacks, strokes without pills</a></p>\n<p><strong>Baby powder cancer case:</strong><a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2019/03/14/johnson-johnson-stock-falls-after-29-m-award-baby-powder-cancer-case/3160022002/\">Johnson &amp; Johnson stock down after California jury awards $29M</a></p>\n<p>The outcome of such cases can help attorneys decide whether to keep fighting similar lawsuits or settle them. Legal experts said a jury verdict in favor of Hardeman and the other test plaintiffs would give their attorneys a strong bargaining position in any settlement talks for the remaining cases before Chhabria.</p>\n<p>The judge had split Hardeman's trial into two phases. Hardeman's attorneys first had to convince jurors that using Roundup was a significant factor in his cancer before they could make arguments for damages.</p>\n<p>The trial will now proceed to the second phase to determine whether the company is liable and if so, for how much.</p>\n<p>Hardeman declined to comment outside court.</p>\n<p>&quot;This has been a long time coming for Mr. Hardeman,&quot; said one of his attorneys, Jennifer Moore. &quot;He's very pleased he had his day in court, and we're looking forward to phase two.&quot;</p>\n<p>Many government regulators have rejected a link between cancer and glyphosate. Monsanto has vehemently denied such a connection, saying hundreds of studies have established that the chemical is safe.</p>\n<p>Bayer, which acquired Monsanto last year, said in a statement after the verdict that it continues to &quot;believe firmly that the science confirms glyphosate-based herbicides do not cause cancer.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;We are confident the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto's conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr. Hardeman's cancer,&quot; it said.</p>\n<p>Monsanto developed glyphosate in the 1970s, and the weed killer is now sold in more than 160 countries and widely used in the U.S.</p>\n<p>The herbicide came under increasing scrutiny after the France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organization, classified it as a &quot;probable human carcinogen&quot; in 2015.</p>\n<p>Lawsuits against Monsanto followed. The company has attacked the international research agency's opinion as an outlier.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says glyphosate is safe for people when used in accordance with label directions.</p>\n<p>Hardeman started using Roundup products to treat poison oak, overgrowth and weeds on his Sonoma County property in the 1980s and continued using them through 2012, according to his attorneys. He was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2015.</p>\n<p><strong>How to avoid an audit:</strong><a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/03/19/irs-audit-triggers-how-avoid-review-your-tax-return-year/3205302002/\">7 red flags that could trigger an IRS audit of your taxes</a></p>",

                "text": "Associated Press\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Roundup weed killer was a substantial factor in a California man's cancer, a jury determined Tuesday in the first phase of a trial that attorneys said could help determine the fate of hundreds of similar lawsuits.\nThe unanimous verdict by the six-person jury in federal court in San Francisco came in a lawsuit filed against Roundup's manufacturer, agribusiness giant Monsanto. Edwin Hardeman, 70, was the second plaintiff to go to trial out of thousands around the country who claim the weed killer causes cancer.\nMonsanto says studies have established that Roundup's active ingredient, glyphosate, is safe.\nA San Francisco jury in August awarded another man $289 million after determining Roundup caused his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A judge later slashed the award to $78 million, and Monsanto has appealed.\nHardeman's trial is before a different judge and may be more significant. U.S. Judge Vince Chhabria is overseeing hundreds of Roundup lawsuits and has deemed Hardeman's case and two others \"bellwether trials.\"\nAspirin is out:Here's how healthy older adults can prevent heart attacks, strokes without pills\nBaby powder cancer case:Johnson & Johnson stock down after California jury awards $29M\nThe outcome of such cases can help attorneys decide whether to keep fighting similar lawsuits or settle them. Legal experts said a jury verdict in favor of Hardeman and the other test plaintiffs would give their attorneys a strong bargaining position in any settlement talks for the remaining cases before Chhabria.\nThe judge had split Hardeman's trial into two phases. Hardeman's attorneys first had to convince jurors that using Roundup was a significant factor in his cancer before they could make arguments for damages.\nThe trial will now proceed to the second phase to determine whether the company is liable and if so, for how much.\nHardeman declined to comment outside court.\n\"This has been a long time coming for Mr. Hardeman,\" said one of his attorneys, Jennifer Moore. \"He's very pleased he had his day in court, and we're looking forward to phase two.\"\nMany government regulators have rejected a link between cancer and glyphosate. Monsanto has vehemently denied such a connection, saying hundreds of studies have established that the chemical is safe.\nBayer, which acquired Monsanto last year, said in a statement after the verdict that it continues to \"believe firmly that the science confirms glyphosate-based herbicides do not cause cancer.\"\n\"We are confident the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto's conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr. Hardeman's cancer,\" it said.\nMonsanto developed glyphosate in the 1970s, and the weed killer is now sold in more than 160 countries and widely used in the U.S.\nThe herbicide came under increasing scrutiny after the France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organization, classified it as a \"probable human carcinogen\" in 2015.\nLawsuits against Monsanto followed. The company has attacked the international research agency's opinion as an outlier.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says glyphosate is safe for people when used in accordance with label directions.\nHardeman started using Roundup products to treat poison oak, overgrowth and weeds on his Sonoma County property in the 1980s and continued using them through 2012, according to his attorneys. He was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2015.\nHow to avoid an audit:7 red flags that could trigger an IRS audit of your taxes",

Kamala Harris, the recently announced presidential candidate, wasn&rsquo;t eligible for election because she had immigrant parents and spent part of her childhood in Canada. The claim, an echo of the &ldquo;birther&rdquo; conspiracy that trailed President Barack Obama, was widely debunked but still addressed seriously by mainstream news pundits, <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/426799-chris-cuomo-apologizes-for-kamala-harris-tweet\">including CNN&rsquo;s Chris Cuomo</a>.</p>\n<p>Even better for Jacob Wohl, the 21-year-old Californian who ignited the Harris birther claim with a tweet, some people actually seemed to accept it as fact.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The believability stuck at about 15 to 18 percent by my measurement,&rdquo; Wohl said in an interview shortly afterward, declaring it &ldquo;not a bad campaign.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Wohl, a self-professed &ldquo;political and corporate intel consultant&rdquo; and supporter of President Donald Trump, is dedicated to plying the malleable fringe of the electorate with dubious claims and disinformation schemes.</p>\n<p><strong>Start the day smarter:</strong><a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://profile.usatoday.com/newsletters/daily-briefing/\">Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox</a></p>\n<p>Amplifying him in that quest are his links to the world&rsquo;s loudest Twitter cheerleader, Trump. Wohl&rsquo;s father, attorney David Wohl, says that as a Trump surrogate he was on calls with the 2016 presidential candidate daily. David Wohl has regularly appeared on cable news networks to promote the president and his policies.</p>\n<p>Trump has retweeted Jacob Wohl&rsquo;s praise &ndash; of the president&rsquo;s economy, or just general &ldquo;WINNING&rdquo;-ness that the &ldquo;<a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldTrumpEUSA/status/893095002615709700\">left-wing media can&rsquo;t stand</a>&rdquo; &ndash; at least three times. They appear to have met at least once, as evidenced by a photo of <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://cdn1.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/story_image_685x375C/images/story/2012/wohl.jpg\">father, son and president together</a>, and the younger Wohl says he has spoken to the president &ldquo;several&rdquo; times. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on their relationship.</p>\n<p>On Twitter, where he has 186,000 followers and is adept at quickly responding to Trump&rsquo;s tweets to gain many more eyeballs, Wohl has claimed, without evidence, that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg is secretly dead or in a vegetative state and that pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats and media outlets were a left-wing &ldquo;false flag&rdquo; operation.</p>\n<p>He flew to Minnesota last week to &ldquo;investigate&rdquo; the rumor that Somali-American Rep. Ilhan Omar married her brother, a mission for which he tried to <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://culttture.com/omarinvestigation/\">fund-raise $25,000 from his online followers</a>. Wohl&rsquo;s trip to the heartland devolved into bizarre tweets in which he suggested that Minneapolis was so overrun by Somali <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobAWohl/status/1099349803732004864\">jihadists</a> that he had to wear a <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobAWohl/status/1099515088304857088\">bulletproof vest</a> and travel with a team of &ldquo;<a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobAWohl/status/1099543838501363713\">security professionals</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Wohl&rsquo;s most prominent gambit was also his most disastrous: an apparent sloppy attempt to accuse Trump's nemesis special counsel Robert Mueller of sexual misconduct days before the midterm elections in November. His actions were <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/30/robert-mueller-targeted-sex-misconduct-hoax-fbi-review/1821254002/\">referred to the FBI for potential criminal investigation</a>. The woman he named as a credible accuser of the special prosecutor, Carolyne Cass, recently told USA TODAY that Wohl &ldquo;made it up,&rdquo; deceived her with a false identity and tried to coerce her to appear at a news conference against her will.</p>\n<p>Wohl initially maintained that Cass's allegations were credible. When told that Cass said they were inaccurate, Wohl then claimed that he couldn&rsquo;t speak about the situation because of a legal non-disclosure agreement with Cass, who denied that such an agreement exists. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment on whether the agency was investigating the episode.</p>\n<p>Deciphering the Mueller saga is characteristic of how difficult it is to grasp at the truth with Wohl, who represents a political moment in which even the most basic facts are in dispute.</p>\n<p>In some ways, Wohl is simply carrying on the dubious American tradition of deceit in politics, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of &ldquo;Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President.&rdquo; Jamieson described 19th-century political operatives who would secretly buy newspapers to dictate coverage, and the dissemination of false accounts about President Andrew Johnson being a murderer.</p>\n<p>The difference now, she said, is that the internet has democratized that deceit. It&rsquo;s more difficult online to determine the source of a claim, a major factor in deciding whether to believe it. Being repeatedly bombarded with a claim &ndash; social media&rsquo;s specialty &ndash;increases its perceived accuracy, even if it&rsquo;s false and has been publicly debunked. People are more likely to believe a false claim that fits their ideology, and the internet naturally facilitates people like Wohl finding and communicating with like-minded groups.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It takes a real talent to figure out what kind of deceptions will gain traction,&rdquo; Jamieson said, and to have both the knowledge of their demographic and technical ability to &ldquo;figure out what will resonate as opposed to what will be laughed at.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Wohl disclosed a raft of schemes he says are in the works that he hopes will resonate in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.</p>\n<p>He says he plans to create &ldquo;enormous left-wing online properties&rdquo; &ndash; such as deceptive Facebook and Twitter accounts &ndash; &quot;and use those to steer the left-wing votes in the primaries to what we feel are weaker candidates compared with Trump.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a plot similar to what Mueller has charged in indictments that the Russians crafted in an effort to boost the 2016 campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein and hobble Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>Another stated scheme: seeking to collect damaging information on left-leaning non-profits including Media Matters for America, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Right Wing Watch by offering their insiders &ldquo;moral reconciliation,&rdquo; and if that doesn&rsquo;t work, &ldquo;things of worth&rdquo; &ndash; such as money.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps those stated plans themselves are a ruse to fool the mainstream media, which he calls a &ldquo;band of lying goblins.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Wohl stressed that the accuracy of the information he spreads is &ldquo;not the important part.&rdquo; All that matters is how far those claims travel, and how many people believe them.</p>\n<p>Wohl said he yearns for the days &ndash; before he was born &ndash; when conservatives would join in outrage over a scene in a sitcom and funnel that unity into other pursuits, like support for unchecked military actions. &ldquo;You think about these incredibly large-scale wars that were just launched without congressional approval, and they were pretty damn good at carrying out the conservative torch, whatever it happened to be at the time,&rdquo; Wohl said.</p>\n<p>In the spread of information, he said, truth is an obsolete concept. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that can&rsquo;t be thought about in a linear, binary true-false, facts-non-facts &ndash; you can&rsquo;t do that anymore,&rdquo; Wohl said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not the way it works.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Packing heat at the hipster coffee shop</h2>\n<p>Wohl chose to meet at Coffee Nature, probably the closest thing to a hipster coffee shop in his resident Orange County, in a nod to the tweets that gained him fame and derision before he was best known for allegedly trying to catfish the special counsel.</p>\n<p>Since last year, Wohl has more than a dozen times claimed on Twitter to have overheard liberals in hipster coffee shops sharing pro-Trump secrets with one another, such as that they were actually overjoyed by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh&rsquo;s confirmation. The tweets conjure up the image of Wohl furtively eavesdropping on surrounding patrons from behind the foam of an oat milk cappuccino.</p>\n<p>He arrived at the Orange County cafe in a black Corvette with new-car paper license plates and extended a rigid hand but did not shake when a reporter grasped it. Sipping a free cup of ice water, the thin, severe-featured Wohl, who speaks in clipped verbiage, quickly worked into conversation that he was carrying a concealed firearm in response to the &ldquo;voluminous left-wing threats&rdquo; he has received.</p>\n<p>Wohl explained that he picks on bohemian coffee shops because he sees them as the &ldquo;Temple Mount&rdquo; of liberalism and calculated that &ldquo;if you in any way impugn the sanctity of the hipster coffee shop, it&rsquo;s going to be something that gets them really charged up.&rdquo; In describing his methods, Wohl casually explained that he makes it up: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll literally hear one thing and I&rsquo;ll flip it 180 degrees.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Wohl said he was eager to correct the record on the Mueller episode, in which his apparent efforts to disgrace Trump&rsquo;s foremost adversary ended up unraveling into one of the weirdest major news stories in a cycle full of them.</p>\n<p>It started with emails received by several news outlets in which the sender claimed an intelligence company had tried to pay her to accuse Mueller of sexual misdeeds. A professor produced emails showing that she had also been approached for information by the company. Reporters followed a <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-crazy-cabal-trying-to-smear-robert-mueller\">bizarre online trail</a> to reveal that Wohl was behind the intelligence company, which seemed to be staffed by an office full of imagined employees. Wohl and his partner in the episode, Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist Jack Burkman, then announced a news conference devolving into farce when a woman who they said was going to make allegations against Mueller didn&rsquo;t show up.</p>\n<p>The result of the Elmore Leonard-esque plot was a media cycle of ridicule for Wohl. One outlet&rsquo;s headline read: &ldquo;<a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/fabricated-mueller-smear-wohl-burkman-sexual-misconduct-surefire-intelligence-hoax.html\">Fabricated Mueller Smear Appears to Have Come From Comically Inept Far-Right Internet Person</a>.&rdquo; The special prosecutor&rsquo;s office broke its customary silence to announce that it had referred the scheme to the FBI for criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>Wohl claimed at the coffee shop, however, that a goal of his scheme had been to trick journalists into thinking that he had offered to pay for dirt on Mueller, so he made up a person and sent those allegations to media outlets. On his phone, he scrolled through emails from reporters at major outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and Buzzfeed who had tried to garner more information from a person who he says did not actually exist.</p>\n<p>He described these emails-- of reporters doing their due diligence-- as trophies from a logic-stretching plan that had as the ultimate goal getting reporters to go to a news conference at a D.C.-area Holiday Inn. &ldquo;The real allegations against Mueller would have been ignored &hellip; had we not roped the media into attending the press conference,&rdquo; Wohl said.</p>\n<p>But those &ldquo;real allegations&rdquo; appear to be even more problematic. At the news conference, Wohl distributed a document that was digitally signed, purportedly by the absent accuser Carolyne Cass, in which she said she had been sexually assaulted by Mueller in New York in 2010. In the interview this month, Wohl referred to Cass as a &ldquo;real accuser&rdquo; and called her allegations credible.</p>\n<p>But when reached by USA TODAY, 34-year-old Carolyne Cass of Los Angeles said Wohl, whom she met on Craigslist, had tricked her by pretending to be an investigator named Matthew Cohen who was trained by Israeli intelligence forces and agreed to help her with &ldquo;unscrupulous characters ripping me off.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cass said she paid the man she knew as Cohen $2,000, for which he did no work but instead offered her the prospect of employment at his intelligence agency and had her speak on the phone to people whose identities she now believes Wohl fabricated.</p>\n<p>Cass said it ultimately became clear that Cohen and his associates, imaginary or otherwise, &ldquo;needed a credible female to put on the line&rdquo; for false allegations about Mueller. &ldquo;They made it up,&rdquo; Cass said of the document accusing Mueller, which was passed around at the news conference. &ldquo;They wrote it and docu-signed it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She claimed Cohen tried to get her to speak at the news conference but she &ldquo;escaped&rdquo; and learned only as the scheme exploded that Cohen was in fact Wohl. &ldquo;He completely lied to me,&rdquo; Cass said.</p>\n<p>Wohl had as recently as this month referred to Cass while speaking in detail about the Mueller episode. But when asked about Cass&rsquo;s version of events, Wohl said he could not speak further because he had signed a non-disclosure agreement with her and &ldquo;can&rsquo;t violate any confidences.&rdquo; Cass said no such agreement existed.</p>\n<p>Burkman also refused to discuss his role in the Mueller scheme.</p>\n<p>Both Wohl and Cass say they have not been contacted by the FBI. Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg said Wohl&rsquo;s actions could be construed by a federal prosecutor as wire fraud, obstruction of justice or conspiracy &ndash; or as possibly violating various state statutes &ndash; but likely fell into a legal &ldquo;gray zone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The whole thing smacks of illegality and nefariousness and deception, but it still needs to have an anchor in criminal statute,&rdquo; Weisberg said.</p>\n<h2>Tax liens and exotic birds</h2>\n<p>Wohl said he didn&rsquo;t decide to fully apply his &ldquo;talents&rdquo; to politics until the rise of Trump, who he describes as a political soulmate in both ideology and tactics. But he said his political awakening came in 2008, when he was in fifth grade and watched Obama&rsquo;s inauguration with great trepidation for what it meant for the national debt.</p>\n<p>Despite his stated concern for fiscal responsibility, public records suggest that both Jacob and his television pundit father have had their own turbulent financial histories.</p>\n<p>A search of television appearances shows that David Wohl &ndash; who was admitted to the California bar in 1989 and works largely in criminal defense &ndash; has been an analyst on Fox News and other cable stations for more than a decade, and his appearances have shifted from that of a legal expert to a fervent defender of the then-candidate and president.</p>\n<p>Like his son, David Wohl has promoted conspiracy theories including that the pipe bombs sent to Democrats and media outlets, for which a Trump supporter in Florida was arrested, were a hoax.</p>\n<p>In a brief interview, David Wohl said he had daily conference calls with Trump to hone messaging during the campaign. A spokesman for Trump&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t respond to a request for comment on the elder Wohl&rsquo;s role.</p>\n<p>A search of public records shows that at least a dozen times since 1995, David Wohl has been the subject of state and federal tax liens in California&rsquo;s Orange and Riverside Counties. Most recently, the IRS named him and his wife in a property lien for $22,002.31 for back income taxes. Though several of the past liens were marked as released, or paid off, the most recent lien was not shown to have been released.</p>\n<p>In divorce filings last year, David Wohl&rsquo;s wife, Michelle, said that he spends money on guitars, watches, firearms, tickets to concerts and sporting events and a recently purchased &ldquo;exotic bird&quot; costing $8,000 to $10,000 while &ldquo;I struggle to make ends meet and live from paycheck to paycheck.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>David Wohl said he had no knowledge of tax liens against him and called this article a &quot;hit piece. ... Trump calls you guys out for (stuff) like this.&quot;</p>\n<p>He said that he and his wife have since reconciled and that her claims in the divorce were &quot;extreme exaggerations&quot; and &quot;garbage.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I don't have my lawyer file documents that are garbage,&quot; Michelle Wohl said when reached for comment, adding that her filings were under penalty of perjury.</p>\n<p>Jacob Wohl&rsquo;s own history with money got off to a rocky start when, as a teenage hedge fund trader, he was investigated by multiple regulatory bodies in 2016.</p>\n<p>The Arizona Corporation Commission and National Futures Association (NFA) investigated allegations including that Wohl and his partner had failed to pay back an investor, did not accurately present the risk of their investments and claimed that they had been in business for 35 years when neither of them had been alive that long.</p>\n<p>Wohl father and son teamed up to fend off the regulators. David Wohl said he called the Los Angeles Police Department to report financial investigators for stalking them. Jacob Wohl declared in filings that his treatment by NFA investigators was evidence of the organization&rsquo;s &ldquo;broader culture of harassment, stalking and thuggery.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Arizona Corporation Commission ordered Wohl to no longer trade securities or provide investment advisory services in the state and to pay just under $33,000 in restitution. The NFA permanently barred Wohl. According to Wohl, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also investigated him and declined to pursue enforcement action. The commission declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Wohl said he ultimately sold his half of his financial business to his partner. He maintained that there was &ldquo;nothing even remotely illegal&rdquo; about his financial enterprise, saying his father &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t going to let me run a rogue hedge fund.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As he has in his political schemes, Wohl displayed glee for high stakes, calling his financial career &ldquo;a good experience&rdquo; and remarking: &ldquo;Who gets to go through a SEC investigation at age 18?&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>A threat from Avenatti</h2>\n<p>While describing his recent professional work &ndash; a vague resume involving doing &ldquo;corporate intelligence&rdquo; for a Los Angeles businessman he won&rsquo;t name and helping Republican lobbyists &ldquo;butt out other lobbyists&rdquo; by gathering information for them &ndash; Wohl&rsquo;s phone began buzzing with the screen reading &ldquo;Dad.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He learned in the ensuing phone conversation that Michael Avenatti, the California attorney who has turned his representation of porn star Stormy Daniels into full-time work as a Trump antagonist, had tweeted at Wohl: &ldquo;I am coming for you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Avenatti had been under investigation by Los Angeles authorities for an alleged domestic violence incident and had suggested that Wohl was involved in setting him up. Upon learning that criminal charges would not be forthcoming, Avenatti celebrated with the vengeful tweet.</p>\n<p>Wohl responded by retreating to the bathroom of the hipster coffee shop, where he retweeted his father&rsquo;s message that they would be reporting Avenatti&rsquo;s threat to the authorities.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not clear why Avenatti has suggested Wohl was involved. In a later interview, Avenatti said he was &ldquo;not at liberty&rdquo; to expound on Wohl&rsquo;s role. Wohl said Avenatti has &ldquo;accused me of putting a GPS device on his car&rdquo; and &ldquo;sending thugs after him to taunt him in public,&rdquo; both of which he denies.</p>\n<p>Avenatti&rsquo;s response: &ldquo;I have no idea what this idiot is talking about. This child is so stupid and so hungry for attention that he will say anything.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Like a drawn-out pro wrestling feud, the duel between Avenatti and Wohl will surely have many chapters, each one more convoluted than the previous. Avenatti vowed that ultimately, Wohl &ldquo;is going to find himself in a penitentiary somewhere.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When Wohl came back from the bathroom, he bristled at a reporter&rsquo;s suggestion that Avenatti &ndash; who is prone to melodrama, has scads of detractors and is skilled at intertwining himself in the major events of a bizarre political era &ndash; is the closest thing to his foil on the left.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Kind of,&rdquo; Wohl protested. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s a loony tune because he&rsquo;s making provably false accusations.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside data-c-cta=\"DIG DEEPER\"><a data-t-l=\"|storyinlinelink\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/03/02/massive-alligator-weighing-700-pounds-found-georgia/3039780002/\">'Massive' alligator weighing about 700 pounds found in Georgia.

                "text": "USA TODAY\nCOSTA MESA, Calif. \u2013 A false claim bubbled up from the internet last month that Sen. Kamala Harris, the recently announced presidential candidate, wasn\u2019t eligible for election because she had immigrant parents and spent part of her childhood in Canada. The claim, an echo of the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy that trailed President Barack Obama, was widely debunked but still addressed seriously by mainstream news pundits, including CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo.\nEven better for Jacob Wohl, the 21-year-old Californian who ignited the Harris birther claim with a tweet, some people actually seemed to accept it as fact.\n\u201cThe believability stuck at about 15 to 18 percent by my measurement,\u201d Wohl said in an interview shortly afterward, declaring it \u201cnot a bad campaign.\u201d\nWohl, a self-professed \u201cpolitical and corporate intel consultant\u201d and supporter of President Donald Trump, is dedicated to plying the malleable fringe of the electorate with dubious claims and disinformation schemes.\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\nAmplifying him in that quest are his links to the world\u2019s loudest Twitter cheerleader, Trump. Wohl\u2019s father, attorney David Wohl, says that as a Trump surrogate he was on calls with the 2016 presidential candidate daily. David Wohl has regularly appeared on cable news networks to promote the president and his policies.\nTrump has retweeted Jacob Wohl\u2019s praise \u2013 of the president\u2019s economy, or just general \u201cWINNING\u201d-ness that the \u201cleft-wing media can\u2019t stand\u201d \u2013 at least three times. They appear to have met at least once, as evidenced by a photo of father, son and president together, and the younger Wohl says he has spoken to the president \u201cseveral\u201d times. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on their relationship.\nOn Twitter, where he has 186,000 followers and is adept at quickly responding to Trump\u2019s tweets to gain many more eyeballs, Wohl has claimed, without evidence, that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg is secretly dead or in a vegetative state and that pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats and media outlets were a left-wing \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation.\nHe flew to Minnesota last week to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the rumor that Somali-American Rep. Ilhan Omar married her brother, a mission for which he tried to fund-raise $25,000 from his online followers. Wohl\u2019s trip to the heartland devolved into bizarre tweets in which he suggested that Minneapolis was so overrun by Somali jihadists that he had to wear a bulletproof vest and travel with a team of \u201csecurity professionals.\u201d\nWohl\u2019s most prominent gambit was also his most disastrous: an apparent sloppy attempt to accuse Trump's nemesis special counsel Robert Mueller of sexual misconduct days before the midterm elections in November. His actions were referred to the FBI for potential criminal investigation. The woman he named as a credible accuser of the special prosecutor, Carolyne Cass, recently told USA TODAY that Wohl \u201cmade it up,\u201d deceived her with a false identity and tried to coerce her to appear at a news conference against her will.\nWohl initially maintained that Cass's allegations were credible. When told that Cass said they were inaccurate, Wohl then claimed that he couldn\u2019t speak about the situation because of a legal non-disclosure agreement with Cass, who denied that such an agreement exists. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment on whether the agency was investigating the episode.\nDeciphering the Mueller saga is characteristic of how difficult it is to grasp at the truth with Wohl, who represents a political moment in which even the most basic facts are in dispute.\nIn some ways, Wohl is simply carrying on the dubious American tradition of deceit in politics, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of \u201cCyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President.\u201d Jamieson described 19th-century political operatives who would secretly buy newspapers to dictate coverage, and the dissemination of false accounts about President Andrew Johnson being a murderer.\nThe difference now, she said, is that the internet has democratized that deceit. It\u2019s more difficult online to determine the source of a claim, a major factor in deciding whether to believe it. Being repeatedly bombarded with a claim \u2013 social media\u2019s specialty \u2013increases its perceived accuracy, even if it\u2019s false and has been publicly debunked. People are more likely to believe a false claim that fits their ideology, and the internet naturally facilitates people like Wohl finding and communicating with like-minded groups.\n\u201cIt takes a real talent to figure out what kind of deceptions will gain traction,\u201d Jamieson said, and to have both the knowledge of their demographic and technical ability to \u201cfigure out what will resonate as opposed to what will be laughed at.\u201d\nWohl disclosed a raft of schemes he says are in the works that he hopes will resonate in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.\nHe says he plans to create \u201cenormous left-wing online properties\u201d \u2013 such as deceptive Facebook and Twitter accounts \u2013 \"and use those to steer the left-wing votes in the primaries to what we feel are weaker candidates compared with Trump.\u201d It\u2019s a plot similar to what Mueller has charged in indictments that the Russians crafted in an effort to boost the 2016 campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein and hobble Hillary Clinton.\nAnother stated scheme: seeking to collect damaging information on left-leaning non-profits including Media Matters for America, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Right Wing Watch by offering their insiders \u201cmoral reconciliation,\u201d and if that doesn\u2019t work, \u201cthings of worth\u201d \u2013 such as money.\nOr perhaps those stated plans themselves are a ruse to fool the mainstream media, which he calls a \u201cband of lying goblins.\u201d\nWohl stressed that the accuracy of the information he spreads is \u201cnot the important part.\u201d All that matters is how far those claims travel, and how many people believe them.\nWohl said he yearns for the days \u2013 before he was born \u2013 when conservatives would join in outrage over a scene in a sitcom and funnel that unity into other pursuits, like support for unchecked military actions. \u201cYou think about these incredibly large-scale wars that were just launched without congressional approval, and they were pretty damn good at carrying out the conservative torch, whatever it happened to be at the time,\u201d Wohl said.\nIn the spread of information, he said, truth is an obsolete concept. \u201cIt\u2019s something that can\u2019t be thought about in a linear, binary true-false, facts-non-facts \u2013 you can\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d Wohl said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the way it works.\u201d\nPacking heat at the hipster coffee shop\nWohl chose to meet at Coffee Nature, probably the closest thing to a hipster coffee shop in his resident Orange County, in a nod to the tweets that gained him fame and derision before he was best known for allegedly trying to catfish the special counsel.\nSince last year, Wohl has more than a dozen times claimed on Twitter to have overheard liberals in hipster coffee shops sharing pro-Trump secrets with one another, such as that they were actually overjoyed by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. The tweets conjure up the image of Wohl furtively eavesdropping on surrounding patrons from behind the foam of an oat milk cappuccino.\nHe arrived at the Orange County cafe in a black Corvette with new-car paper license plates and extended a rigid hand but did not shake when a reporter grasped it. Sipping a free cup of ice water, the thin, severe-featured Wohl, who speaks in clipped verbiage, quickly worked into conversation that he was carrying a concealed firearm in response to the \u201cvoluminous left-wing threats\u201d he has received.\nWohl explained that he picks on bohemian coffee shops because he sees them as the \u201cTemple Mount\u201d of liberalism and calculated that \u201cif you in any way impugn the sanctity of the hipster coffee shop, it\u2019s going to be something that gets them really charged up.\u201d In describing his methods, Wohl casually explained that he makes it up: \u201cI\u2019ll literally hear one thing and I\u2019ll flip it 180 degrees.\u201d\nWohl said he was eager to correct the record on the Mueller episode, in which his apparent efforts to disgrace Trump\u2019s foremost adversary ended up unraveling into one of the weirdest major news stories in a cycle full of them.\nIt started with emails received by several news outlets in which the sender claimed an intelligence company had tried to pay her to accuse Mueller of sexual misdeeds. A professor produced emails showing that she had also been approached for information by the company. Reporters followed a bizarre online trail to reveal that Wohl was behind the intelligence company, which seemed to be staffed by an office full of imagined employees. Wohl and his partner in the episode, Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist Jack Burkman, then announced a news conference devolving into farce when a woman who they said was going to make allegations against Mueller didn\u2019t show up.\nThe result of the Elmore Leonard-esque plot was a media cycle of ridicule for Wohl. One outlet\u2019s headline read: \u201cFabricated Mueller Smear Appears to Have Come From Comically Inept Far-Right Internet Person.\u201d The special prosecutor\u2019s office broke its customary silence to announce that it had referred the scheme to the FBI for criminal investigation.\nWohl claimed at the coffee shop, however, that a goal of his scheme had been to trick journalists into thinking that he had offered to pay for dirt on Mueller, so he made up a person and sent those allegations to media outlets. On his phone, he scrolled through emails from reporters at major outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and Buzzfeed who had tried to garner more information from a person who he says did not actually exist.\nHe described these emails-- of reporters doing their due diligence-- as trophies from a logic-stretching plan that had as the ultimate goal getting reporters to go to a news conference at a D.C.-area Holiday Inn. \u201cThe real allegations against Mueller would have been ignored \u2026 had we not roped the media into attending the press conference,\u201d Wohl said.\nBut those \u201creal allegations\u201d appear to be even more problematic. At the news conference, Wohl distributed a document that was digitally signed, purportedly by the absent accuser Carolyne Cass, in which she said she had been sexually assaulted by Mueller in New York in 2010. In the interview this month, Wohl referred to Cass as a \u201creal accuser\u201d and called her allegations credible.\nBut when reached by USA TODAY, 34-year-old Carolyne Cass of Los Angeles said Wohl, whom she met on Craigslist, had tricked her by pretending to be an investigator named Matthew Cohen who was trained by Israeli intelligence forces and agreed to help her with \u201cunscrupulous characters ripping me off.\u201d\nCass said she paid the man she knew as Cohen $2,000, for which he did no work but instead offered her the prospect of employment at his intelligence agency and had her speak on the phone to people whose identities she now believes Wohl fabricated.\nCass said it ultimately became clear that Cohen and his associates, imaginary or otherwise, \u201cneeded a credible female to put on the line\u201d for false allegations about Mueller. \u201cThey made it up,\u201d Cass said of the document accusing Mueller, which was passed around at the news conference. \u201cThey wrote it and docu-signed it.\u201d\nShe claimed Cohen tried to get her to speak at the news conference but she \u201cescaped\u201d and learned only as the scheme exploded that Cohen was in fact Wohl. \u201cHe completely lied to me,\u201d Cass said.\nWohl had as recently as this month referred to Cass while speaking in detail about the Mueller episode. But when asked about Cass\u2019s version of events, Wohl said he could not speak further because he had signed a non-disclosure agreement with her and \u201ccan\u2019t violate any confidences.\u201d Cass said no such agreement existed.\nBurkman also refused to discuss his role in the Mueller scheme.\nBoth Wohl and Cass say they have not been contacted by the FBI. Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg said Wohl\u2019s actions could be construed by a federal prosecutor as wire fraud, obstruction of justice or conspiracy \u2013 or as possibly violating various state statutes \u2013 but likely fell into a legal \u201cgray zone.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole thing smacks of illegality and nefariousness and deception, but it still needs to have an anchor in criminal statute,\u201d Weisberg said.\nTax liens and exotic birds\nWohl said he didn\u2019t decide to fully apply his \u201ctalents\u201d to politics until the rise of Trump, who he describes as a political soulmate in both ideology and tactics. But he said his political awakening came in 2008, when he was in fifth grade and watched Obama\u2019s inauguration with great trepidation for what it meant for the national debt.\nDespite his stated concern for fiscal responsibility, public records suggest that both Jacob and his television pundit father have had their own turbulent financial histories.\nA search of television appearances shows that David Wohl \u2013 who was admitted to the California bar in 1989 and works largely in criminal defense \u2013 has been an analyst on Fox News and other cable stations for more than a decade, and his appearances have shifted from that of a legal expert to a fervent defender of the then-candidate and president.\nLike his son, David Wohl has promoted conspiracy theories including that the pipe bombs sent to Democrats and media outlets, for which a Trump supporter in Florida was arrested, were a hoax.\nIn a brief interview, David Wohl said he had daily conference calls with Trump to hone messaging during the campaign. A spokesman for Trump\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the elder Wohl\u2019s role.\nA search of public records shows that at least a dozen times since 1995, David Wohl has been the subject of state and federal tax liens in California\u2019s Orange and Riverside Counties. Most recently, the IRS named him and his wife in a property lien for $22,002.31 for back income taxes. Though several of the past liens were marked as released, or paid off, the most recent lien was not shown to have been released.\nIn divorce filings last year, David Wohl\u2019s wife, Michelle, said that he spends money on guitars, watches, firearms, tickets to concerts and sporting events and a recently purchased \u201cexotic bird\" costing $8,000 to $10,000 while \u201cI struggle to make ends meet and live from paycheck to paycheck.\u201d\nDavid Wohl said he had no knowledge of tax liens against him and called this article a \"hit piece. ... Trump calls you guys out for (stuff) like this.\"\nHe said that he and his wife have since reconciled and that her claims in the divorce were \"extreme exaggerations\" and \"garbage.\"\n\"I don't have my lawyer file documents that are garbage,\" Michelle Wohl said when reached for comment, adding that her filings were under penalty of perjury.\nJacob Wohl\u2019s own history with money got off to a rocky start when, as a teenage hedge fund trader, he was investigated by multiple regulatory bodies in 2016.\nThe Arizona Corporation Commission and National Futures Association (NFA) investigated allegations including that Wohl and his partner had failed to pay back an investor, did not accurately present the risk of their investments and claimed that they had been in business for 35 years when neither of them had been alive that long.\nWohl father and son teamed up to fend off the regulators. David Wohl said he called the Los Angeles Police Department to report financial investigators for stalking them. Jacob Wohl declared in filings that his treatment by NFA investigators was evidence of the organization\u2019s \u201cbroader culture of harassment, stalking and thuggery.\u201d\nThe Arizona Corporation Commission ordered Wohl to no longer trade securities or provide investment advisory services in the state and to pay just under $33,000 in restitution. The NFA permanently barred Wohl. According to Wohl, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also investigated him and declined to pursue enforcement action. The commission declined to comment.\nWohl said he ultimately sold his half of his financial business to his partner. He maintained that there was \u201cnothing even remotely illegal\u201d about his financial enterprise, saying his father \u201cwasn\u2019t going to let me run a rogue hedge fund.\u201d\nAs he has in his political schemes, Wohl displayed glee for high stakes, calling his financial career \u201ca good experience\u201d and remarking: \u201cWho gets to go through a SEC investigation at age 18?\u201d\nA threat from Avenatti\nWhile describing his recent professional work \u2013 a vague resume involving doing \u201ccorporate intelligence\u201d for a Los Angeles businessman he won\u2019t name and helping Republican lobbyists \u201cbutt out other lobbyists\u201d by gathering information for them \u2013 Wohl\u2019s phone began buzzing with the screen reading \u201cDad.\u201d\nHe learned in the ensuing phone conversation that Michael Avenatti, the California attorney who has turned his representation of porn star Stormy Daniels into full-time work as a Trump antagonist, had tweeted at Wohl: \u201cI am coming for you.\u201d\nAvenatti had been under investigation by Los Angeles authorities for an alleged domestic violence incident and had suggested that Wohl was involved in setting him up. Upon learning that criminal charges would not be forthcoming, Avenatti celebrated with the vengeful tweet.\nWohl responded by retreating to the bathroom of the hipster coffee shop, where he retweeted his father\u2019s message that they would be reporting Avenatti\u2019s threat to the authorities.\nIt\u2019s not clear why Avenatti has suggested Wohl was involved. In a later interview, Avenatti said he was \u201cnot at liberty\u201d to expound on Wohl\u2019s role. Wohl said Avenatti has \u201caccused me of putting a GPS device on his car\u201d and \u201csending thugs after him to taunt him in public,\u201d both of which he denies.\nAvenatti\u2019s response: \u201cI have no idea what this idiot is talking about. This child is so stupid and so hungry for attention that he will say anything.\u201d\nLike a drawn-out pro wrestling feud, the duel between Avenatti and Wohl will surely have many chapters, each one more convoluted than the previous. Avenatti vowed that ultimately, Wohl \u201cis going to find himself in a penitentiary somewhere.\u201d\nWhen Wohl came back from the bathroom, he bristled at a reporter\u2019s suggestion that Avenatti \u2013 who is prone to melodrama, has scads of detractors and is skilled at intertwining himself in the major events of a bizarre political era \u2013 is the closest thing to his foil on the left.\n\u201cKind of,\u201d Wohl protested. \u201cBut he\u2019s a loony tune because he\u2019s making provably false accusations.\u201d\n'Massive' alligator weighing about 700 pounds found in Georgia.

Each time, the detective said he was short on cash and would return.</p>\n<p>In November, Circuit Judge Cynthia Cox approved the secret installation of surveillance cameras inside.</p>\n<p>Between Nov. 30 and Jan. 10, police observed 140 sex acts performed for money, resulting in charges against several of the spa's employees.</p>\n<p>Indian River County agencies issued warrants for 173 people, on charges ranging from human trafficking to racketeering to soliciting prostitution.</p>\n<p>&quot;These girls are there all day long, into the evening. They can't leave and they're performing sex acts,&quot; Vero Beach Police Chief David Currey said. &quot;Some of them may tell us they're OK, but they're not.

Some stayed for days, others for months.</li><li>None of the victims were allowed to leave on their own. They did not have their own vehicles and generally spoke Mandarin or Cantonese, not English.</li><li>Many of the victims came from China on temporary work visas, indebted to the the brokers who helped them reach America, but believing legitimate jobs awaited them.</li><li>The victims were shamed, intimidated and taught not to speak to law enforcement or immigration officials.</li><li>Bank records revealed the spa owners also paid for Backpage.com advertisements.</li></ul>\n<h2>Feb. 22: Newsmaker identified</h2>\n<p>Jupiter Police, <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/2019/02/22/jupiter-police-speak-role-human-trafficking-sex-money-case/2950323002/\">during a Feb. 22 news conference</a>, named 25 men to be charged with soliciting prostitution at Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter.

He declined to provide many other specifics.</p>\n<p>Sharp indicated that Kraft paid for these acts but did not disclose how much Kraft paid, or his method of payment. He did say, however, that the &quot;average fee&quot; for the spa was $59 for 30 minutes and $79 for an hour.</p>\n<h2>Feb. 25: Charges filed</h2>\n<p>The State Attorney's Office in West Palm Beach held a news conference Feb. 25 and announced 25 individuals, those named by Jupiter Police on Feb. 22, were charged with solicitation of prostitution, a misdemeanor, according to State Attorney Dave Aronberg.</p>\n<p>Of those charged was Kraft who Aronberg said <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/crime/2019/02/25/state-attorney-nfl-owner-robert-kraft-visited-jupiter-spa-morning-afc-championship/2979389002/\">visited Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter</a> the evening of Jan. 19 and the morning of Jan. 20, the same day his team won the AFC title in Kansas City.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: </strong> <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/crime/2019/03/07/nfl-owner-robert-kraft-must-appear-person-arraignment-florida-spa-prostitution-case/3090304002/\">Kraft must appear in person at the arraignment which is set for 9 a.m. March 28 in Palm Beach Gardens.</a></p>\n<p>Later that day, the Law Firm of Kibbey Wagner in Stuart filed two emergency petitions with the Circuit Courts in Martin and Palm Beach counties<a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/crime/2019/02/25/florida-human-trafficking-investigation-law-firm-tries-block-video-document-release/2984344002/\"> seeking to block the release of videotapes and customer lists involving massage parlors under police investigation</a>.</p>\n<p>&quot;We are seeking judicial intervention to determine what evidence is permitted to be released and to whom it should be released to,&quot; Richard Kibbey, senior partner at the law firm said in a news release.</p>\n<p>&quot;(The) press conference and subsequent interviews with various law enforcement officials has resulted in this case drawing national press coverage by television networks and major newspapers who distribute their papers across the country and through the internet, social media coverage, and commentary on this case is at frenzied levels due to the sexual nature of the allegations and the prominence of some of the men who are alleged to have broken the law in this case,&quot; the motion states.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: </strong>Thomas Baird, attorney for Jupiter police, <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/crime/martin-county/2019/03/04/florida-prostitution-ring-martin-county-jupiter-law-enforcement-sued-block-day-spa-videos/3057064002/\">said the department has released no video recordings</a>.</p>\n<p>The recordings are part of an ongoing criminal investigation and exempt from public-records law disclosures, Baird said.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 18, as Martin County authorities were announcing multiple arrests and shuttered four day spas, the Martin County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office asked Martin County Judge Darren Steele to order sealing evidence collected by investigators, including an <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/crime/martin-county/2019/04/03/robert-kraft-sex-spa-case-fake-bomb-threat/3357882002/\">application for a search warrant to install cameras inside the spas</a>; the probable-cause affidavits; and &ldquo;inventories and other documents&rdquo; related to the investigation.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: </strong><a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/crime/martin-county/2019/04/03/robert-kraft-sex-spa-case-fake-bomb-threat/3357882002/\">Police used a fake bomb threat to clear out a Florida spa and install cameras as part of a prostitution investigation</a> before Kraft and others allegedly visited, according to a court filing made public April 3.</p>\n<p>Kraft&rsquo;s attorneys wrote in an expanded motion to suppress the video footage that Jupiter Police Department officers &ldquo;caused a phony &lsquo;suspicious package&rsquo; warning to be issued for the spa in order to force an evacuation so the JPD could install hidden cameras inside several of its private massage rooms, as well as in the Spa&rsquo;s lobby.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The newest motion again alleges police used &quot;allusions to human trafficking&quot; to secure the warrant.</p>\n<h2>What about Orange County?</h2>\n<p>Orlando resident Yongzhang Yan <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/crime/indian-river-county/2019/02/21/human-trafficking-florida-massage-parlors-vero-beach-sebastian/2920354002/\">owns Rainbow Spa in Orlando and East Spa in Winter Park.

Holsman and TCPalm staff. Compilation and digital presentation by Dacia Johnson.\n__________________________________\nDetails of an international human trafficking operation tied to prostitution in massage parlors in Florida and month-long investigation involving multiple law enforcement agencies unraveled over the course of several days. Here's what we know:\nFeb. 19: First details released\nMartin County\nOfficials in Martin County held a press conference Feb. 19 discussing details of a nine-month investigation into a human trafficking ring.\nTwo women, at least 100 men and several spas were identified as being involved in the ring according to Martin County Sheriff William Snyder.\nThe women, both 48, identified as managing the spas \u2014 four in Martin County and one in Jupiter \u2014 are Ruimei Li, of Jupiter, and Lixia Zhu, of Stuart.\n\u201cThe tentacles of this go from here to New York to China, in Florida from here to Orange County,\u201d Snyder said.\nSnyder said the case began in July 2018 when a detective responded to a complaint from the Health Department regarding what appeared to be human trafficking at a massage parlor.\n\u201cIt was clear that multiple women were working and living inside the spas. They were cooking on the back steps of the business,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cThey were sleeping in the massage parlor on the massage tables.\u201d\nAccording to Snyder, details include:\nOfficials were in the process of seizing $2 million to $3 million in assets\nThe women were from China\n13 Mandarin interpreters were speaking with the women\nWomen were being treated as victims, rather than paid sex workers\nOfficials followed as much as $20 million moving in and out of China\nNo gang affiliation, but ties to New York\nAsked whether celebrities or prominent people could be involved, Snyder said, \u201cThere will be a newsmaker in this one.\u201d\nMore: Illicit sex spa income funds property in Martin County, records show\nUpdate: The sheriff's office formally seized $150,189 in currency, a condo with a market value of about $125,000 and two vehicles, a 2015 Lincoln and a 2017 Nissan.\nIndian River County\nIndian River County announced a six-month investigation into \u201cmultiple massage parlor locations\u201d on the same day. Nearly 200 individuals were charged with more than 200 counts of solicitation. Officials said more details would be released at a later date.\nFeb. 20: Detailed documents obtained\nDetails in a 16-page affidavit obtained Feb. 20 showed Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter had online reviews identifying it in slang terms as a provider of sexual services.\nPostings from February 2015 to March 2018 on a forum-based website detailed visits involving Asian women supplying sex acts, massages and body rubs for pay. Investigators found evidence of bodily fluids and got video of sex acts inside the Palm Beach County business.\nHua Zhang, 58, and 39-year-old Lei Wang were arrested in connection with the spa at 103 S. U.S. 1 in Jupiter.\nRecords supporting criminal charges at Orchids show an investigation began in October after Martin County sheriff\u2019s detectives reported \u201cthey were working several cases of prostitution and possible human trafficking at Asian massage parlors in their county.\u201d\nFeb. 21: Indian River's extensive details\nOfficials in Indian River County released more details at a Feb. 21 news conference following their first brief announcement Feb. 19.\nA health department complaint at East Sea Spa, located just outside of Sebastian, launched a Sheriff\u2019s Office investigation in October.\nAn employee conducting a routine inspection reported concerns after seeing clothing, suitcases, food, bedding and other signs people were living inside.\nThe six-month investigation revealed human traffickers were luring vulnerable girls to massage parlors in Indian River County, where they were coerced into working as prostitutes, according to Vero Beach Police.\nIn September, a Vero Beach detective twice visited undercover, equipped with a camera, a recorder and cash.\nEach time, he asked for a 30-minute massage, paid $50 and was escorted to a dimly lit room.\nAfter a rubdown, his masseuse would offer various sexual favors \u2014 intercourse for $160 to $200, oral sex for $100 and stimulation by hand for $40 to $60. Each time, the detective said he was short on cash and would return.\nIn November, Circuit Judge Cynthia Cox approved the secret installation of surveillance cameras inside.\nBetween Nov. 30 and Jan. 10, police observed 140 sex acts performed for money, resulting in charges against several of the spa's employees.\nIndian River County agencies issued warrants for 173 people, on charges ranging from human trafficking to racketeering to soliciting prostitution.\n\"These girls are there all day long, into the evening. They can't leave and they're performing sex acts,\" Vero Beach Police Chief David Currey said. \"Some of them may tell us they're OK, but they're not. We know that\u2026 even though we may have charges on some of them, we'd rather them be victims.\"\nDetectives observed a manager purchasing condoms, food and water for one business.\nDetectives watched multiple women with suitcases be transported to and from the spa, \"for the purpose of sexual servitude,\" according to an arrest warrant.\nPolice said victims, identified in court records as Jane Does, lived inside the spas and worked as prostitutes. Some stayed for days, others for months.\nNone of the victims were allowed to leave on their own. They did not have their own vehicles and generally spoke Mandarin or Cantonese, not English.\nMany of the victims came from China on temporary work visas, indebted to the the brokers who helped them reach America, but believing legitimate jobs awaited them.\nThe victims were shamed, intimidated and taught not to speak to law enforcement or immigration officials.\nBank records revealed the spa owners also paid for Backpage.com advertisements.\nFeb. 22: Newsmaker identified\nJupiter Police, during a Feb. 22 news conference, named 25 men to be charged with soliciting prostitution at Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter. Of those named was New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\nJupiter Police Chief Daniel Kerr said police have video evidence of Kraft engaging in sex acts on two separate visits to the spa.\n\"We categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity,\" a spokesman for Kraft said in a statement. \"Because it is a judicial matter, we will not be commenting further.\"\nAndrew Sharp, the lead detective on the case, said that Kraft was driven to the Jupiter spa on two occasions and received sex acts, which were captured by video inside the building. He declined to provide many other specifics.\nSharp indicated that Kraft paid for these acts but did not disclose how much Kraft paid, or his method of payment. He did say, however, that the \"average fee\" for the spa was $59 for 30 minutes and $79 for an hour.\nFeb. 25: Charges filed\nThe State Attorney's Office in West Palm Beach held a news conference Feb. 25 and announced 25 individuals, those named by Jupiter Police on Feb. 22, were charged with solicitation of prostitution, a misdemeanor, according to State Attorney Dave Aronberg.\nOf those charged was Kraft who Aronberg said visited Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter the evening of Jan. 19 and the morning of Jan. 20, the same day his team won the AFC title in Kansas City.\nUpdate: Kraft must appear in person at the arraignment which is set for 9 a.m. March 28 in Palm Beach Gardens.\nLater that day, the Law Firm of Kibbey Wagner in Stuart filed two emergency petitions with the Circuit Courts in Martin and Palm Beach counties seeking to block the release of videotapes and customer lists involving massage parlors under police investigation.\n\"We are seeking judicial intervention to determine what evidence is permitted to be released and to whom it should be released to,\" Richard Kibbey, senior partner at the law firm said in a news release.\n\"(The) press conference and subsequent interviews with various law enforcement officials has resulted in this case drawing national press coverage by television networks and major newspapers who distribute their papers across the country and through the internet, social media coverage, and commentary on this case is at frenzied levels due to the sexual nature of the allegations and the prominence of some of the men who are alleged to have broken the law in this case,\" the motion states.\nUpdate: Thomas Baird, attorney for Jupiter police, said the department has released no video recordings.\nThe recordings are part of an ongoing criminal investigation and exempt from public-records law disclosures, Baird said.\nOn Feb. 18, as Martin County authorities were announcing multiple arrests and shuttered four day spas, the Martin County Sheriff\u2019s Office asked Martin County Judge Darren Steele to order sealing evidence collected by investigators, including an application for a search warrant to install cameras inside the spas; the probable-cause affidavits; and \u201cinventories and other documents\u201d related to the investigation.\nUpdate: Police used a fake bomb threat to clear out a Florida spa and install cameras as part of a prostitution investigation before Kraft and others allegedly visited, according to a court filing made public April 3.\nKraft\u2019s attorneys wrote in an expanded motion to suppress the video footage that Jupiter Police Department officers \u201ccaused a phony \u2018suspicious package\u2019 warning to be issued for the spa in order to force an evacuation so the JPD could install hidden cameras inside several of its private massage rooms, as well as in the Spa\u2019s lobby.\u201d\nThe newest motion again alleges police used \"allusions to human trafficking\" to secure the warrant.\nWhat about Orange County?\nOrlando resident Yongzhang Yan owns Rainbow Spa in Orlando and East Spa in Winter Park. Yan also owns AA Massage in Sebastian and East Spa in Vero Beach.\nYan is married to Lanyun Ma, who was in charge of the day-to-day operations at the Vero Beach location, according to officials. Ma was charged with human trafficking, racketeering, unlawful transportation for the purpose of prostitution, deriving support from proceeds of prostitution and engaging in prostitution. Her bail was set at $155,500.\nMa is the only person, as of Feb. 26, charged with human trafficking despite multiple agencies linking the 10 spas shut down to Chinese sex trafficking.\nYan is not currently facing charges, according to Vero Beach Police, but the investigation is ongoing.\n\"We think that (Yan) is the person that is leading this little organization,\" Vero Beach Police Detective Sgt. Phil Huddy said. \"We're going to do our best to find the evidence we need to link him to this and bring him to justice.\"\nThe couple's spas each generated tens of thousands of dollars per month, according to police, meaning annual revenues could have reached into the millions.\nPolice are now following that money, poring over records to determine what happened to it and building evidence to ultimately seize any funds they can.\nIt's unclear whether investigators observed sex acts at either Orlando-area spa, but the Orlando Sentinel reports both spas were shuttered.\nUpdate: Documents released March 13 show investigators believe the two Orlando area spas shared sex workers with the other Florida massage parlors under investigation.\nVero Beach Detective Sgt. Phil Huddy said eight Asian women, described as \"suspects,\" had been \"rotated\" between Vero Beach and the two Orange County spas, according to a search warrant application.\nRainbow Spa Massage: 1809-2 E. Colonial Drive, Orlando\nEast Spa & Massage: 1410A Gene St., Winter Park\nOn Jan. 28 and 30, undercover investigators entered the Orlando area spas two times each.\nEach time, detectives said they were massaged by young Asian women who would brush against the men's inner thighs or genitalia, then negotiate prices for sexual services, according to the search warrant application.\nThe detectives said the women did not cover the men's naked bodies during the massages, a violation of local ordinances and Florida statutes.\nSometimes the women would expose themselves or prompt the detectives to touch them, according to the highly detailed warrant.\nA 30-minute massage at Rainbow Spa Massage cost $40 (plus a $20 tip) and added sexual services were available for $60 to $140, according to undercover agents.\nAt East Spa & Massage, a 30-minute massage cost $50, and additional services would cost $40 to $200, detectives reported.\nUpdate: The spas were searched and closed on Feb. 19, but not separately investigated.\nWhat about the victims?\nIn many cases, officials used the term \"human trafficking\" in connection with the investigations, but trafficking arrests have been limited. Investigators found evidence women were living in the spas.\nMartin County Sheriff William Snyder said to bring a trafficking charge, a victim must cooperate.\n\u201cI need one of these women, under the patient and legal care of a public defender, to tell us exactly how it is that they\u2019re coerced, what is it that keeps them from running out into the street and asking for help,\u201d Snyder said.\nSnyder said three women are in the Martin County Jail after the raids.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make their life as comfortable as possible,\u201d Snyder said of the three women in the Martin County Jail. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to get them to take one step toward us.\u201d\nSnyder said that during an interview, one of the women said she came to the United States to work in a nail salon with a promise of high pay. She said she started in a nail salon business in Chicago a few years ago.\n\u201cAfter a period of time she found herself being forced into the sex trafficking,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cShe did say that she had relatives in China who she said would be in jeopardy if she cooperated. So that\u2019s a pretty strong case.\u201d\nSnyder said he watched the interview.\n\u201cShe was overcome with emotion and broke down sobbing,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cIt was tragic to watch, it was gut-wrenching for me.\u201d\nSnyder said she shared that a man was involved with a gun who intimated he\u2019d use it, and that her passports were locked up.\nSnyder said a Mandarin-speaking interpreter and public defender were there.\nBut halfway through the interview, Snyder said a Mandarin-speaking attorney showed up demanding to see her. Snyder said that attorney spoke to Zhu, and she stopped cooperating.\n\u201cIt threw a chill over the entire investigative division,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cWe realized what had happened.\u201d\nMore details\nBig names\nKenneth Wessel, 75, of Indian River Shores, is the president of the John's Island Foundation and a former board member of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Indian River County. He was arrested Feb. 20 and charged with soliciting prostitution. He has since been released on $1,000 bail.\nWessel resigned from the foundation Feb. 25, according to the foundation's executive director.\nNew England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was charged with two counts of soliciting prostitution for paying for sexual services at Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter.\nUpdate: Prosecutors in Kraft\u2019s solicitation of prostitution case filed a notice of appeal May 17 over a Florida judge\u2019s decision to suppress video obtained by police inside a spa Kraft allegedly visited twice in January.\nAn appeal by the Palm Beach County state attorney was expected after Judge Leonard Hanser\u2019s ruling May 13 to exclude the video evidence from the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, along with the car stop that led to the identification of Kraft. Both are crucial to the prosecutors\u2019 case against Kraft, who was charged with two misdemeanors in February.\nThe appeal will be heard by the Pam Beach County Circuit Court; no date has been set.\nUpdate: The appeal of a Palm Beach County judge\u2019s ruling that threw out as evidence secretly recorded video inside a Jupiter day spa visited by New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft will be decided by the 4th District Court of Appeal, according to court records.\nIn a one-page filing July 16, the 4th DCA, seated in West Palm Beach, agreed to accept jurisdiction to hear an appeal filed by the state related to Palm Beach County Judge Leonard Hanser, who on May 13 ruled video obtained inside the Orchids of Asia Day Spa cannot be used by prosecutors.\nBillionaire equity firm owner John Childs, who lives seasonally in Indian River Shores, is wanted on a solicitation of prostitution charge, according to a warrant for his arrest. He had not been arrested as of Feb. 25.\nChilds owns J.W. Childs Associates, a private equity firm based in Massachusetts. Childs resigned following the accusations, the firm announced Childs' \"retirement\" Feb. 25 in a press release and said he currently was not active in managing the firm before he retired.\nChilds has maintained he is innocent, telling Bloomberg he was falsely accused.\nFormer Citigroup President John Havens, 62, is accused soliciting prostitution at Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, according to Jupiter Police Department.\nThe president of Kolter Homes, Richard Covell, 55, of Singer Island, resigned after being accused of soliciting prostitution. He was arrested March 4.\nDuring an interview with TCPalm, Covell said he resigned to focus on personal matters, and praised Kolter Homes for the work it has done, calling it \"a great company.\"\nPunishment\nThe soliciting prostitution charges are first-degree misdemeanors, punishable by up to a year in jail.\nFlorida statutes require a minimum of 10 days in jail for any offenses after the first violation. A conviction also carries the possibility of a $5,000 fine, 100 hours of community service and participation in educational programs.\nState Sen. Gayle Harrell, a Republican from Stuart, believes anyone convicted of soliciting prostitution from a victim of human trafficking should be forced to spend 30 days in jail, in addition to other penalties imposed by the courts.\nHarrell filed the legislation, Senate Bill 370, in mid-January \u2014 as local law enforcement officers were wrapping up their months-long investigation of day spas suspected of holding women from China in \"sexual servitude.\"\nHuman trafficking and racketeering \u2014 often referred to by law enforcement as \"RICO,\" short for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization \u2014 are the most serious charges levied so far.\nThey are first-degree felonies, punishable by up to 30 years in prison. If any of the victims are found to be minors or if they are seriously physically harmed, the punishments can escalate to life sentences.\nWrongly accused\nSandipkumar Patel, 47, was arrested Feb. 25 on misdemeanor charges of use of a structure or conveyance for prostitution and soliciting prostitution.\nSheriff\u2019s Lt. Mike Dougherty has said Patel, of Jensen Beach, was wrongly identified as having patronized Florida Therapy Spa for sex acts in Stuart on Nov. 19.\nCharges against Patel were dropped in court papers filed Friday, a day after attorney David Golden entered a not-guilty plea.\nPatel and his wife spoke to the media March 5 at Golden\u2019s office in Stuart.\nPatel said his friends call him Sam. He said one of his proudest moments was becoming a U.S. citizen.\nHe said if he does something to bring shame to his family, his daughters wouldn't be able to marry.\nAnother man's charges were dropped after the Indian River County Sheriff's Office revealed he was misidentified by deputies.\nJeffrey Jewett, 65, of Grant, was not the man captured on video at East Sea Spa, said Sheriff's Office spokesman Maj. Eric Flowers.\nFlowers said Jewett turned himself in Feb. 22, the day after officials announced nearly 200 arrest warrants had been issued countywide in connection with three spas shut down Feb. 19.\nFlowers said the vehicle driven to the spa this winter was registered to Jewett, but another similar-looking man was driving.\nDeals offered\nFirst-time offenders, such as Kraft, charged with misdemeanors have been offered pre-trial diversion deals that would ultimately lead to the dismissal of solicitation charges.\nThe agreement proposed by prosecutors mandates the men review the evidence and admit they would be found guilty if the case went to trial. The Wall Street Journal was the first media outlet to report the offer.\nUpdate: Robert Kraft won't take diversion deal in sex spa case, at least for now\nVideo evidence\nAttorneys for Kraft and more than a dozen other defendants facing charges in the Orchids of Asia Day Spa sex-for-pay case filed court paperwork March 20 asking that evidence, including videos of sex acts, not be publicly released.\nThen, on March 28, Kraft's attorney Jack Goldberger filed an eight-page motion March 28 stating the video recordings are \"fruits of an unlawful\" search warrant.\nOn April 12, County Court Judge Leonard Hanser ultimately did not rule on whether to grant the protective order that attorneys for Kraft wanted to protect the release of evidence, including videos, of Kraft at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter.\nMore:Police snuck cameras into massage parlors years before Robert Kraft charged with soliciting prostitution\nThen, on April 23, Hanser ruled that footage of Kraft\u2019s visit to a Florida massage parlor will not be released to the public until after the New England Patriots owner\u2019s trial is underway or the case is otherwise adjudicated. Hanser wrote in his 10-page decision that \u201cmaking these images public, at this time, seriously jeopardizes Defendant\u2019s fundamental right to a fair and impartial jury.\u201d\nSaying he would \"piggyback\" on Hanser's earlier order that protected the release of videos depicting Kraft getting sex services, Circuit Judge Joseph Marx granted April 29 a protection order preventing the release of videos in the cases of Lei Wang, 45, and Hua Zhang, 58. Both women were arrested in the Orchids of Asia Day Spa investigation.\nMore:31 male, female customers videotaped at spa Robert Kraft also visited sue over recordings\nTestifying April 30 during the video suppression hearing for Kraft, Department of Health employee Karen Herzog she felt threatened as the inspection progressed.\n\u201cThe actions of the manager. Any time that I was going into \u2026 the rooms that had the bedding and the clothing and the personal hygiene items \u2026 she was with me trying to cover stuff up with a blanket,\u201d Herzog said. \u201cShe was trying to conceal.\u201d\n\u201cI was starting to feel uneasy,\u201d Herzog said. \u201cI felt uneasy as the inspection progressed, I began to feel more and more uneasy.\u201d\nMeanwhile, in Martin County, Judge Kathleen Roberts ruled prosecutors can't use as evidence videos secretly recorded by law enforcement during a sex-for-pay investigation revealed in February.\nIn a six-page order, Roberts ruled that Martin County Sheriff's Office detectives last fall failed to observe \"strict standards\" required to be followed when secretly recording spa clients while searching for evidence of criminal activity.\nMore:Judge's decision to throw out sex spa videos could be crushing blow to prosecution\nOn May 8, Palm Beach County state attorney Dave Aronberg alleged Kraft attorneys William Burck and Alex Spiro intentionally made \u201ca false statement of fact\u201d during a motion to suppress hearing May 1.\nIn a major victory for Kraft, Hanser on May 13 ruled that video obtained from inside the the spa cannot be used by prosecutors. The ruling does not directly affect whether the video will be released to the public, although Kraft's legal team is expected to use the decision to further efforts to keep the footage out of the public domain.\nWhat's next?\nChief Assistant State Attorney Tom Bakkedahl said investigators are questioning people who have elected to cooperate with authorities.\nIt\u2019s unclear how many victims of human trafficking will be identified, said Bakkedahl, who declined to detail where the women are or what help they may be receiving.\n\u201cIt could be anywhere from two to five (victims) at this stage, but I\u2019m not positive,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who have been identified as potential victims are being cared for, I have been informed of that.\u201d\nBakkedahl has assigned three assistant state attorneys to prosecute those charged in Martin and Indian River counties.\nIf a criminal connection is established between the Martin and Jupiter day spas, which would involve two judicial circuits, Bakkedahl said it\u2019s possible the cases could be turned over to the Florida Attorney General\u2019s Office of Statewide Prosecution.\nAttorney General Ashley Moody was in Stuart with Martin County Sheriff Snyder and other state law enforcement officials as the Martin and Jupiter arrests were announced.\n\u201cThe Attorney General has made it clear that fighting human trafficking is one of her top priorities,\" said Kylie Mason, press secretary for Moody.\nUpdate: Fourteen women and one man have been charged with working in the spas. Their cases are now working their way through the court system, a process that will likely take years.\nA handful of employees remain wanted, according to police and prosecutors.\nFor a searchable database of the men charged with soliciting prostitution, click here.\nUpdate: Two woman in Martin County pleaded to their charges. One woman pleaded no contest to one felony charge as prosecutors dropped other charges. She could face up to 15 years in state prison. The other woman pleaded no contest to a felony offense of deriving proceeds or support from prostitution. She spoke through a Mandarin Chinese interpreter.\nUpdate: Shen Mingbi, 58, of Jupiter was arrested April 22 on eight counts of offering to commit prostitution and a single count of deriving support from proceeds of prostitution after a Jupiter police investigation.

But they were reluctant to promise to cut list prices without other reforms.</p>\n<p>They argued that other factors, such as pharmacy benefit managers that negotiate discounts and insurance coverage, have greater influence on the price consumers pay at the pharmacy counter. They spoke of drug rebates that don't always reach consumers, payments tied to the value of a drug and more transparency.</p>\n<p>Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier called pricing &quot;complex and interdependent,&quot; and said addressing cost, access and affordability would require bringing &quot;all the parties around the table.&quot;</p>\n<p>Multiple senators questioned AbbVie CEO Richard A. Gonzalez about how the company set the price of the arthritis drug Humira. The list price of the drug more than doubled over six years and now costs more than $60,000 per year.</p>\n<p>Sen. Ron Wyden asked Gonzalez whether the $22.6 million he earned in 2017, which included a $4.3 million bonus, was tied to increasing Humira sales.</p>\n<p>&quot;That strikes me as problematic,&quot; the Oregon Democrat said. &quot;Higher prices in the U.S. were responsible (for) increasing sales of Humira. Would you make a smaller bonus if you dropped the price of Humira?&quot;</p>\n<p>Gonzalez said his bonus was based off several factors, not solely revenue generated by Humira.</p>\n<p>Senators were skeptical of the industry's price-setting practices and heavy spending on marketing and sales spending.</p>\n<p>Sen. John Cornyn highlighted Humira as an example of why the Senate should consider reforming patent laws. The Texas Republican said AbbVie had more than 100 patents tied to Humira, a drug that has been on the market since 2003.</p>\n<p>Patents give drug companies exclusive rights to sell a drug for several years before generic companies can make competing versions of the drug.</p>\n<p>&quot;I support drug companies recovering a profit,&quot; Cornyn said. But &quot;at some point, that patent has to end, that exclusivity has to end,&quot; so patients have access to more affordable generic drugs.</p>\n<p>Other senators questioned whether Americans are subsidizing the cost of developing new drugs for the rest of the world &ndash; both through higher list prices charged to U.S. consumers compared to other developed nations and taxpayer-funded research grants that pay for early scientific discoveries that might lead to new drugs.</p>\n<p>Sen. Sherrod Brown said the average cost of a specialty drug in 2015 was more than $52,000, about twice as much as what the average Medicare recipient collects in annual income.</p>\n<p>&quot;So taxpayers subsidize your research, subsidize your marketing and you continue to raise drug list prices on them,&quot; the Ohio Democrat said. &quot;Americans can&rsquo;t afford to pay for prescription drugs that cost more money than they make in a year. We can&rsquo;t continue to give Big Pharma the blank check.&quot;</p>\n<p>Wyden said the hearing was filled with &quot;happy talk,&quot; but no firm commitments to reduce prices if drugs rebates are eliminated. He wanted each CEO to answer in writing whether they would agree to lower prices if rebates are eliminated.</p>\n<p>Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who chairs the committee, opened the hearing by saying he expected &quot;open, honest answers from the pharmaceutical industry to figure out how we got here and see what ideas they have to make things better.&quot;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all trying to understand the sticker shock that many drugs generate,&quot; he said. &ldquo;There is a balance between incentivizing innovation and keeping prices affordable for consumers and taxpayers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s about EpiPen, insulin or other prescriptions, in the thousands of letters I&rsquo;ve received, Iowans have made clear that high drug prices are hurting them,&quot; Grassley said. &quot;I&rsquo;ve heard about people skipping doses of their prescription drugs to make them last until the next paycheck.&quot;</p>\n<p>The drug industry and its main lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, have resisted efforts to curb drug prices.</p>\n<p>The drug industry defeated efforts to import less expensive versions of the brand-name drugs sold in other nations. The industry was an early supporter of the Affordable Care Act and avoided negotiating drug prices for Medicare recipients.</p>\n<p>The industry and its supporters say the cost of prescription drugs is rising because the population is growing older and demand is increasing. More than half of Americans has been prescribed a drug.</p>\n<p>The industry says insurance plans that cover less and pharmacy-benefit managers who serve as middlemen also deserve scrutiny.</p>",

Sherrod Brown said the average cost of a specialty drug in 2015 was more than $52,000, about twice as much as what the average Medicare recipient collects in annual income.\n\"So taxpayers subsidize your research, subsidize your marketing and you continue to raise drug list prices on them,\" the Ohio Democrat said. \"Americans can\u2019t afford to pay for prescription drugs that cost more money than they make in a year. We can\u2019t continue to give Big Pharma the blank check.\"\nWyden said the hearing was filled with \"happy talk,\" but no firm commitments to reduce prices if drugs rebates are eliminated. He wanted each CEO to answer in writing whether they would agree to lower prices if rebates are eliminated.\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who chairs the committee, opened the hearing by saying he expected \"open, honest answers from the pharmaceutical industry to figure out how we got here and see what ideas they have to make things better.\"\n\u201cWe\u2019re all trying to understand the sticker shock that many drugs generate,\" he said. \u201cThere is a balance between incentivizing innovation and keeping prices affordable for consumers and taxpayers.\u201d\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s about EpiPen, insulin or other prescriptions, in the thousands of letters I\u2019ve received, Iowans have made clear that high drug prices are hurting them,\" Grassley said. \"I\u2019ve heard about people skipping doses of their prescription drugs to make them last until the next paycheck.\"\nThe drug industry and its main lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, have resisted efforts to curb drug prices.\nThe drug industry defeated efforts to import less expensive versions of the brand-name drugs sold in other nations. The industry was an early supporter of the Affordable Care Act and avoided negotiating drug prices for Medicare recipients.\nThe industry and its supporters say the cost of prescription drugs is rising because the population is growing older and demand is increasing. More than half of Americans has been prescribed a drug.\nThe industry says insurance plans that cover less and pharmacy-benefit managers who serve as middlemen also deserve scrutiny.",

LOUIS &ndash; United Methodists on Tuesday rejected an effort by more progressive members of the global church <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://bit.ly/2XpG7Fz\">to lift the denomination's ban on same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy</a>.</p>\n<p>During the special session of the church's General Conference in St. Louis, delegates voted not to substitute the more inclusive One Church Plan for the conservative Traditional Plan, which reinforces the denomination's current prohibitions.</p>\n<p>The swap failed by 75 votes, 374 to 449. Later Tuesday, delegates in a 438-384 vote approved the Traditional Plan as some opposed to it disrupted the meeting in protest.</p>\n<p>The Rev. Tom Berlin, a delegate from the Virginia Conference, spoke from the General Conference stage in support of the One Church Plan, which would have allowed same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy while adding protections for churches and pastors who do not support the marriages.</p>\n<p>&quot;What&rsquo;s being said in private conversations is that if the Traditional Plan, the majority plan, is voted in today, you will be putting a virus into the American church and it will make it very sick and it will be sick quickly,&quot; Berlin said.</p>\n<h2>Urging support for One Church Plan</h2>\n<p>The push for substitution was delivered via a minority report. It is a General Conference mechanism that supporters of the One Church Plan decided to use after the plan failed to make it out of legislative committee on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Berlin said passing the Traditional Plan sends a hurtful message to LGBT people in the church and their allies. He said he had already heard from some people who said they would be leaving the church if the Traditional Plan passes.</p>\n<p>&quot;Whether you like it or not, they feel that their church is exhibiting itself as being against gay people along with others,&quot; Berlin said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your intention I know, but it&rsquo;s what they experience and that matters.&quot;</p>\n<p>Nancy Denardo, a delegate from the Western Pennsylvania Conference, spoke against the One Church Plan substitution and cited parts of the Bible as support for her reasoning.</p>\n<p>&quot;The One Church Plan does not agree with the words of our savior and in so doing deceives young persons into believing that same-gender marriage is OK with God when clearly it is not,&quot; Denardo said. &quot;There is danger to that not only to those being deceived but the deceivers as well.&quot;</p>\n<h2>Methodists divided over LGBT issues</h2>\n<p>Before the top policy-making body of the denomination voted down the One Church Plan, the delegates, bishops and others on the floor of the special session joined together in prayer.</p>\n<p>The United Methodist Church remains deeply divided over the denomination's ban on same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy.</p>\n<p>This week's big meeting in St. Louis put that on full display and the outcome threatens to split the global church of more than 12 million members.</p>\n<p>United Methodists have disagreed over their church's position that homosexuality is &quot;incompatible with Christian teaching&quot; and other LGBT matters for nearly 50 years. They continue to do so today.</p>\n<p>The 864 lay and clergy delegates from around the world are voting Tuesday on how the church should move ahead.</p>\n<p>The legislative committee on Monday advanced the Traditional Plan.</p>\n<p>But parts of the Traditional Plan were ruled unconstitutional under church rules Tuesday by the denomination's Judicial Council. It remains to be seen how those rulings will impact the delegate's work on Tuesday.</p>\n<p><em>Follow Holly Meyer on Twitter: @HollyAMeyer. </em></p>",

LOUIS \u2013 United Methodists on Tuesday rejected an effort by more progressive members of the global church to lift the denomination's ban on same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy.\nDuring the special session of the church's General Conference in St. Louis, delegates voted not to substitute the more inclusive One Church Plan for the conservative Traditional Plan, which reinforces the denomination's current prohibitions.\nThe swap failed by 75 votes, 374 to 449. Later Tuesday, delegates in a 438-384 vote approved the Traditional Plan as some opposed to it disrupted the meeting in protest.\nThe Rev. Tom Berlin, a delegate from the Virginia Conference, spoke from the General Conference stage in support of the One Church Plan, which would have allowed same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy while adding protections for churches and pastors who do not support the marriages.\n\"What\u2019s being said in private conversations is that if the Traditional Plan, the majority plan, is voted in today, you will be putting a virus into the American church and it will make it very sick and it will be sick quickly,\" Berlin said.\nUrging support for One Church Plan\nThe push for substitution was delivered via a minority report. It is a General Conference mechanism that supporters of the One Church Plan decided to use after the plan failed to make it out of legislative committee on Tuesday.\nBerlin said passing the Traditional Plan sends a hurtful message to LGBT people in the church and their allies. He said he had already heard from some people who said they would be leaving the church if the Traditional Plan passes.\n\"Whether you like it or not, they feel that their church is exhibiting itself as being against gay people along with others,\" Berlin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not your intention I know, but it\u2019s what they experience and that matters.\"\nNancy Denardo, a delegate from the Western Pennsylvania Conference, spoke against the One Church Plan substitution and cited parts of the Bible as support for her reasoning.\n\"The One Church Plan does not agree with the words of our savior and in so doing deceives young persons into believing that same-gender marriage is OK with God when clearly it is not,\" Denardo said. \"There is danger to that not only to those being deceived but the deceivers as well.\"\nMethodists divided over LGBT issues\nBefore the top policy-making body of the denomination voted down the One Church Plan, the delegates, bishops and others on the floor of the special session joined together in prayer.\nThe United Methodist Church remains deeply divided over the denomination's ban on same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy.\nThis week's big meeting in St. Louis put that on full display and the outcome threatens to split the global church of more than 12 million members.\nUnited Methodists have disagreed over their church's position that homosexuality is \"incompatible with Christian teaching\" and other LGBT matters for nearly 50 years. They continue to do so today.\nThe 864 lay and clergy delegates from around the world are voting Tuesday on how the church should move ahead.\nThe legislative committee on Monday advanced the Traditional Plan.\nBut parts of the Traditional Plan were ruled unconstitutional under church rules Tuesday by the denomination's Judicial Council.

As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 7 million people in 14 states live where a flood warning was still in effect, the National Weather Service said.</p>\n<p>In Nebraska alone, the farm and ranch losses because of floods could reach $1 billion, the state's farm bureau said.</p>\n<p>Vice President Mike Pence surveyed damage in Nebraska on Tuesday, talking to first responders and visiting a temporary shelter. He promised expedited action on presidential disaster declarations for Nebraska and Iowa.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to make sure that federal resources are there for you,&rdquo; Pence told volunteers at Waterloo, a town of less than 1,000 residents about 20 miles west of Omaha that was virtually cut off by the floodwaters.</p>\n<p>About 200 miles of levees were compromised in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and Kansas, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said. Thousands of people have been driven from their homes by the fast-rising waters.</p>\n<p>Flooding is expected to continue throughout the week in several states as high water flows down the Missouri River.</p>\n<p><strong>Start the day smarter:</strong><a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://profile.usatoday.com/newsletters/daily-briefing/\">Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox</a></p>\n<p>&ldquo;The levees are busted, and we aren&rsquo;t even into the wet season when the rivers run high,&rdquo; said Tom Bullock, the emergency management director for Missouri&rsquo;s Holt County.</p>\n<p>In North Dakota, Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney declared a state of emergency despite what he described as tremendous strides in permanent flood protection in recent years.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is a very serious flood forecast, and we will meet it with a serious response,&quot; he said. &quot;It is critically important for everyone to know that we will need the public&rsquo;s assistance. We cannot be complacent.&quot;</p>\n<p>In Illinois, Freeport City Manager Lowell Crow said the town of 25,000 residents west of Rockford could see an all-time record flood along the Pecatonica River, which was at its highest level since 1933 on Tuesday. City officials braced for flooding in the downtown area, he said.</p>\n<p>In Missouri, 130 people were urged to leave their Atchison County homes near strained levees, three of which had been overtopped by water. Missouri State Highway Patrol crews were on standby for rescues.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The next four to five days are going to be pretty rough,&rdquo; said Rhonda Wiley, the county emergency management and 911 director.</p>\n<p>The Missouri River was expected to crest Thursday in St. Joseph, Missouri, at its third-highest level on record, the National Weather Service said. Military C-130 planes have been evacuated from nearby Rosecrans Air National Guard Base.</p>\n<p>In Iowa, <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2019/03/18/glenwood-iowa-flooding-ia-governor-kim-reynolds-tours-historic-damage-rolling-loess-hills-disaster/3201443002/\">water stood 10 feet high near Pacific Junction</a>, where only the top halves of gas stations, homes and storage units were visible. Mills County Emergency Management Director Larry Hurst said the flooding might be worse than some of the most extreme historical events &ndash; in 1952, 1993 and 2011.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is actually different even than the flood of '52,&quot; he said. &quot;There's water on this entire basin.&quot;</p>\n<p>Touring the damage, Reynolds said the flooding was unlike anything she had seen before as the state's top elected official.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It looked like an ocean,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Water gushed through a levee break near the Plattsmouth Toll Bridge, where the Platte and Missouri Rivers converge. The mystery, Hurst said, is how long it will take for the water to recede.</p>\n<p>&quot;To tell you the truth, I don't know,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think anybody knows.&quot;</p>\n<p>Glenwood Mayor Ron Kohn said his city of 5,000 was in pretty good shape, but to the west, where the aging levee broke under rapidly rising waters last week, farms were swamped.</p>\n<p>&quot;That's all going to be gone until next year,&quot; Kohn said. &quot;Rice is about all they could grow out there now.&quot;</p>\n<p>Reynolds said 41 Iowa counties have requested and been approved for help through the governor's disaster proclamation last week.

                "text": "USA TODAY\nSeventy-four cities, 65 counties and four tribal areas in Nebraska declared states of emergency Tuesday as swaths of the Midwest battled rivers swollen by days of heavy rains and spring snowmelt.\nThree deaths have been blamed on the flooding in Nebraska. As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 7 million people in 14 states live where a flood warning was still in effect, the National Weather Service said.\nIn Nebraska alone, the farm and ranch losses because of floods could reach $1 billion, the state's farm bureau said.\nVice President Mike Pence surveyed damage in Nebraska on Tuesday, talking to first responders and visiting a temporary shelter. He promised expedited action on presidential disaster declarations for Nebraska and Iowa.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure that federal resources are there for you,\u201d Pence told volunteers at Waterloo, a town of less than 1,000 residents about 20 miles west of Omaha that was virtually cut off by the floodwaters.\nAbout 200 miles of levees were compromised in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and Kansas, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said. Thousands of people have been driven from their homes by the fast-rising waters.\nFlooding is expected to continue throughout the week in several states as high water flows down the Missouri River.\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\u201cThe levees are busted, and we aren\u2019t even into the wet season when the rivers run high,\u201d said Tom Bullock, the emergency management director for Missouri\u2019s Holt County.\nIn North Dakota, Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney declared a state of emergency despite what he described as tremendous strides in permanent flood protection in recent years.\n\u201cThis is a very serious flood forecast, and we will meet it with a serious response,\" he said. \"It is critically important for everyone to know that we will need the public\u2019s assistance. We cannot be complacent.\"\nIn Illinois, Freeport City Manager Lowell Crow said the town of 25,000 residents west of Rockford could see an all-time record flood along the Pecatonica River, which was at its highest level since 1933 on Tuesday. City officials braced for flooding in the downtown area, he said.\nIn Missouri, 130 people were urged to leave their Atchison County homes near strained levees, three of which had been overtopped by water. Missouri State Highway Patrol crews were on standby for rescues.\n\u201cThe next four to five days are going to be pretty rough,\u201d said Rhonda Wiley, the county emergency management and 911 director.\nThe Missouri River was expected to crest Thursday in St. Joseph, Missouri, at its third-highest level on record, the National Weather Service said. Military C-130 planes have been evacuated from nearby Rosecrans Air National Guard Base.\nIn Iowa, water stood 10 feet high near Pacific Junction, where only the top halves of gas stations, homes and storage units were visible. Mills County Emergency Management Director Larry Hurst said the flooding might be worse than some of the most extreme historical events \u2013 in 1952, 1993 and 2011.\n\"This is actually different even than the flood of '52,\" he said. \"There's water on this entire basin.\"\nTouring the damage, Reynolds said the flooding was unlike anything she had seen before as the state's top elected official.\n\u201cIt looked like an ocean,\u201d she said.\nWater gushed through a levee break near the Plattsmouth Toll Bridge, where the Platte and Missouri Rivers converge. The mystery, Hurst said, is how long it will take for the water to recede.\n\"To tell you the truth, I don't know,\" he said. \"I don't think anybody knows.\"\nGlenwood Mayor Ron Kohn said his city of 5,000 was in pretty good shape, but to the west, where the aging levee broke under rapidly rising waters last week, farms were swamped.\n\"That's all going to be gone until next year,\" Kohn said. \"Rice is about all they could grow out there now.\"\nReynolds said 41 Iowa counties have requested and been approved for help through the governor's disaster proclamation last week. President Donald Trump tweeted his support for Reynolds and authorities who were fighting the floods.\nIn Nebraska, the National Guard said its members joined with the State Patrol to escort a caravan of semis and fuel tankers packed with food and supplies from Omaha to Fremont. The Department of Transportation cleared the way by \"plowing over 5 inches of mud outside of Fremont,\" the National Guard said on Twitter. Nearly 70 percent of the state is under a disaster declaration.\nOffutt Air Force Base\nOffutt Air Force Base, home of the 55th Wing \u2013 the \"Fightin' Fifty-Fifth\" \u2013 was essentially underwater.

One proposal would be banning flavoring of e-cigarette liquids.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>USA TODAY</p>\n<p>Seeking to curb teen vaping, San Francisco officials on Tuesday introduced legislation to ban the sale of electronic cigarettes until the federal government regulates them.</p>\n<p>The measure, if approved, would be the first of its kind nationally, preventing people from buying e-cigarettes online or at stores in the largest city in northern California, pending the Food and Drug Administration's evaluation of their impact on public health.</p>\n<p>Such a restriction would build on the city's aggressive vaping regulations. Voters in 2018 upheld the city's first-in-the-nation outright ban on the sale of flavored tobacco and flavored vaping liquids.</p>\n<p>But vaping proponents who say e-cigarettes help adult smokers quit packs of Marlboros argued the proposal would unfairly target vaping products.

Voters in 2018 upheld the city's first-in-the-nation outright ban on the sale of flavored tobacco and flavored vaping liquids.\nBut vaping proponents who say e-cigarettes help adult smokers quit packs of Marlboros argued the proposal would unfairly target vaping products. Cigarettes and cigars with well-documented health risks could be sold more widely as a result, Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, told USA TODAY.\n\"No youth should vape, but no politician should try to enact modern-day prohibition,\" Conley said. \"It is hard for San Francisco to get even more absurd, but this proposal and the rhetoric around it is absolutely insane.\"\nSan Francisco Supervisor Shamann Walton, who introduced the legislation, also on Tuesday announced a plan to bar making, selling or distributing tobacco products on city property. The legislation targets e-cigarette company Juul Labs, which rents part of Pier 70.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want them in our city,\u201d Walton said at a press conference.\nMore: More teens vape, but binge drinking and opioid use are down\nIn a statement, Juul said the city's proposed legislation would make it harder for adult smokers to buy e-cigarettes that could help them curb addiction.

I think San Francisco may have greater priorities.\"\nWhile 1.5 million more students used e-cigarettes in 2018 compared to the previous year, the FDA said the usage of combustible tobacco products such as cigars did not significantly change in the same period.\nConcerned about underage addiction, City Attorney Dennis Herrera said he sent a joint letter with Chicago and New York demanding the FDA evaluate the public health risks posed by e-cigarettes.

Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington said she was &ldquo;100 percent in favor of President Trump&rsquo;s wall&quot; but Congress shouldn't give up its power delegated by the Constitution.</p>\n<p>&quot;When that power is delegated to the executive or judicial branches, representatives become elected bystanders and &lsquo;We the People&rsquo; no longer have a voice,&quot; McMorris Rodgers said.</p>\n<p>The GOP-controlled Senate must weigh in on the &quot;privileged resolution&quot; within 18 days.</p>\n<p>Vice President Mike Pence and legal experts discussed the emergency declaration with Republican senators during their weekly caucus lunch Tuesday. Several senators said afterward they were still processing the information.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;One thing that&rsquo;s not in debate in our conference &ndash; we really do think there&rsquo;s a crisis at the border,&rdquo; said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. &ldquo;There are different points of view about how to address that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump declared an emergency this month after Congress sent to the president a bipartisan funding bill that failed to meet his demand for $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump took the action to <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/15/government-shutdown-trump-declare-emergency-get-wall-funding/2859532002/\">free up</a> billions from other sources to pay for the barrier.</p>\n<p>Democrats have said the <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/22/national-emergency-democrats-introduce-bill-block-trump-plan/2944058002/\">declaration is unconstitutional</a> and are using a provision from the <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title50/chapter34&edition=prelim\">National Emergencies Act</a> to try to halt the president.</p>\n<p>&quot;If the president is successful in getting his way on this, rest assured he will come back, he will try this again, probably on other issues, as will future presidents. The Congress must step up,&quot; said Rep. Joaquin Castro, the Texas Democrat leading the effort.</p>\n<p>Hours before the vote, Trump formally threatened to veto the legislation.</p>\n<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the core of the Constitution that lawmakers swore to uphold is the separation of powers between the three branches of government.</p>\n<p>&quot;Perhaps it&rsquo;s time for our country to have a civics lesson,&quot; Pelosi said before the vote. &quot;Our founders rejected the idea of a monarch.&quot;</p>\n<p>As the resolution moves to the Senate, here's what you need to know:</p>\n<h2>Which Senate Republicans have said they&rsquo;ll support the measure?</h2>\n<p>The national emergency has been controversial for Republicans, many of whom warned the president his move could set a bad precedent. But it is unclear how many will publicly oppose the president and vote to terminate the order.</p>\n<p>On Monday night, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican, announced he would vote in favor of a resolution that disapproved of the national emergency in an <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/25/i-support-trumps-vision-border-security-i-would-vote-against-emergency/?utm_term=.818f3b86c01f\">op-ed in the Washington Post.</a></p>\n<p>&quot;As a U.S. senator, I cannot justify providing the executive with more ways to bypass Congress,&quot; Tillis wrote. &quot;As a conservative, I cannot endorse a precedent that I know future left-wing presidents will exploit to advance radical policies that will erode economic and individual freedoms.&quot;</p>\n<p><a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://bangordailynews.com/2019/02/20/politics/susan-collins-says-lawsuit-is-quickest-way-to-stop-trump-border-emergency-declaration/\">GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine</a> and <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-dems-gear-tuesday-vote-nullify-trump-s-emergency-border-n975696\">Lisa Murkowski of Alaska</a> have also indicated support for the measure in its current form.</p>\n<p>Sen. Martha McSally, R-Arizona, <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://twitter.com/SenMcSallyAZ/status/1100548790661058560\">said Tuesday night</a> she was &quot;seeking assurances that the money will not come from Arizona military construction projects&quot; for her vote.</p>\n<h2>Will the resolution pass the Senate?</h2>\n<p>After passing the House on Tuesday, the resolution must be taken up within 18 days by the Senate, where its future remains unclear.</p>\n<p>Most legislation that comes up in the Senate requires 60 votes to pass. However, because this resolution is considered &quot;privileged,&quot; it needs just 51 votes, increasing the chances of passage. There are 47 Senate Democrats &ndash; none of whom have spoken against the resolution &ndash; so if the Democrats stay unified only four Republicans would need to cross party lines. Tillis, Collins and Murkowski already have said they would if the legislation remains the same as it was introduced.</p>\n<h2>Why does this resolution get special treatment?</h2>\n<p>Normally legislation comes up for a vote at the discretion of the speaker or majority leader. That means if a lawmaker introduces legislation the leadership doesn't want to deal with, the bill may not be brought up for a vote. But because this resolution comes from the National Emergencies Act, once it is introduced it must come up for a vote.</p>\n<h2>Are there other options?</h2>\n<p>If Congress is unable to halt the national emergency through the legislative process, members could still file lawsuits, a move Pelosi did not rule out during a press conference last week.</p>\n<p>California and 15 other states have already <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/18/donald-trump-california-sues-over-national-emergency-delcaration/2911625002/\">filed a lawsuit over the declaration</a>, arguing it exceeds the power of the president and unconstitutionally redirects federal money that would have gone to their states.</p>\n<p>And the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/15/donald-trump-national-emergency-border-wall-lawsuits/2882729002/\">filed a lawsuit</a> on behalf of Texas landowners who were told their property would be seized for the wall.</p>\n<p><em>Contributing: Deborah Barfield Berry, John Fritze, Alan Gomez, Christal Hayes</em></p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The House voted 245-182 Tuesday to block President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency along the southern border, but Democrats didn\u2019t win enough support from Republicans to overcome Trump\u2019s threatened veto.\nOnly 13 Republicans joined all Democrats in backing the measure, even though many had warned against the declaration.\nGOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington said she was \u201c100 percent in favor of President Trump\u2019s wall\" but Congress shouldn't give up its power delegated by the Constitution.\n\"When that power is delegated to the executive or judicial branches, representatives become elected bystanders and \u2018We the People\u2019 no longer have a voice,\" McMorris Rodgers said.\nThe GOP-controlled Senate must weigh in on the \"privileged resolution\" within 18 days.\nVice President Mike Pence and legal experts discussed the emergency declaration with Republican senators during their weekly caucus lunch Tuesday. Several senators said afterward they were still processing the information.\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s not in debate in our conference \u2013 we really do think there\u2019s a crisis at the border,\u201d said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \u201cThere are different points of view about how to address that.\u201d\nTrump declared an emergency this month after Congress sent to the president a bipartisan funding bill that failed to meet his demand for $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump took the action to free up billions from other sources to pay for the barrier.\nDemocrats have said the declaration is unconstitutional and are using a provision from the National Emergencies Act to try to halt the president.\n\"If the president is successful in getting his way on this, rest assured he will come back, he will try this again, probably on other issues, as will future presidents. The Congress must step up,\" said Rep. Joaquin Castro, the Texas Democrat leading the effort.\nHours before the vote, Trump formally threatened to veto the legislation.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the core of the Constitution that lawmakers swore to uphold is the separation of powers between the three branches of government.\n\"Perhaps it\u2019s time for our country to have a civics lesson,\" Pelosi said before the vote. \"Our founders rejected the idea of a monarch.\"\nAs the resolution moves to the Senate, here's what you need to know:\nWhich Senate Republicans have said they\u2019ll support the measure?\nThe national emergency has been controversial for Republicans, many of whom warned the president his move could set a bad precedent. But it is unclear how many will publicly oppose the president and vote to terminate the order.\nOn Monday night, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican, announced he would vote in favor of a resolution that disapproved of the national emergency in an op-ed in the Washington Post.\n\"As a U.S. senator, I cannot justify providing the executive with more ways to bypass Congress,\" Tillis wrote. \"As a conservative, I cannot endorse a precedent that I know future left-wing presidents will exploit to advance radical policies that will erode economic and individual freedoms.\"\nGOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have also indicated support for the measure in its current form.\nSen. Martha McSally, R-Arizona, said Tuesday night she was \"seeking assurances that the money will not come from Arizona military construction projects\" for her vote.\nWill the resolution pass the Senate?\nAfter passing the House on Tuesday, the resolution must be taken up within 18 days by the Senate, where its future remains unclear.\nMost legislation that comes up in the Senate requires 60 votes to pass. However, because this resolution is considered \"privileged,\" it needs just 51 votes, increasing the chances of passage. There are 47 Senate Democrats \u2013 none of whom have spoken against the resolution \u2013 so if the Democrats stay unified only four Republicans would need to cross party lines. Tillis, Collins and Murkowski already have said they would if the legislation remains the same as it was introduced.\nWhy does this resolution get special treatment?\nNormally legislation comes up for a vote at the discretion of the speaker or majority leader. That means if a lawmaker introduces legislation the leadership doesn't want to deal with, the bill may not be brought up for a vote. But because this resolution comes from the National Emergencies Act, once it is introduced it must come up for a vote.\nAre there other options?\nIf Congress is unable to halt the national emergency through the legislative process, members could still file lawsuits, a move Pelosi did not rule out during a press conference last week.\nCalifornia and 15 other states have already filed a lawsuit over the declaration, arguing it exceeds the power of the president and unconstitutionally redirects federal money that would have gone to their states.\nAnd the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen filed a lawsuit on behalf of Texas landowners who were told their property would be seized for the wall.\nContributing: Deborah Barfield Berry, John Fritze, Alan Gomez, Christal Hayes",

That energy and activism helped Democrats retake the House.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about the legislation.</p>\n<h2>What would the bills do?</h2>\n<p>One bill, <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/116/crpt/hrpt11/CRPT-116hrpt11.pdf\">H.R. 8</a>, would require background checks for private transactions, such as purchases online and at gun shows. Currently, only federally licensed firearms dealers, importers and manufacturers are required to conduct background checks on customers under federal law. (Twenty states and D.C. have already expanded background checks to include at least some private sales.)</p>\n<p>The other bill, <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/116/crpt/hrpt12/CRPT-116hrpt12.pdf\">H.R. 1112,</a> would extend to at least 10 days the amount of time firearms dealers must wait for a response from the background check system before the sale can proceed. Currently, they can make the sale if they haven&rsquo;t received a response in three days.</p>\n<h2>What are the arguments in favor?</h2>\n<p>Advocates say the bills would close loopholes in the background check system. For example, the gunman who killed nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, had a record that, under the law, would have made him ineligible to buy a gun, according to <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/06/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-background-check-charleston-c/\">PolitiFact.</a> But because of clerical errors in the FBI&rsquo;s database, the background check was still going on after the three-day deadlin so the dealer was able to proceed with the sale.</p>\n<p>About one in five gun owners <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2595892\">surveyed in 2015</a> by researchers from Northeastern and Harvard universities said they obtained their guns without a background check &ndash; whether as a gift or through a purchase.</p>\n<h2>Would there still be exceptions?</h2>\n<p>Yes. Family members could still give guns to other close family members without conducting a background check, unless the relative is not legally eligible to own a gun. A gun could be loaned to another person while hunting or on a shooting range, so long as there&rsquo;s no reason to believe the gun would be used to commit a crime and the borrower is legally allowed to have a gun. Other exceptions include a temporary transfer necessary to prevent &ldquo;imminent death or great bodily harm.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>What are the arguments against?</h2>\n<p>Opponents say background checks are worthless unless they are paired with a national gun registry, and that would intrude on gun owners&rsquo; rights. They argue the changes would not have prevented some of the recent mass shootings, such as the 2018 <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/10/parkland-one-year-after-shooting-where-key-figures-are-now/2721798002/\">mass shooting in Parkland,</a> Fla., where the defendant had passed a background check. And they say the cost &ndash; up to $125 in some places &ndash; and extra hurdle of getting a background check could be a significant obstacle for those trying to defend themselves.</p>\n<h2>What do shooting survivors think?</h2>\n<p>The bill expanding background checks, H.R. 8, was introduced on Jan. 8, the eight-year anniversary of the mass shooting in Arizona that left six dead and that severely wounded Rep. Gabby Giffords and 12 others. Giffords, who co&ndash;founded a gun&ndash;control group after leaving Congress, is lobbying for the legislation on Capitol Hill this week.</p>\n<p>But Louisiana <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/14/scalise-said-emotional-return-baseball-field/703674002/\">Rep. Steve Scalise</a>, another shooting survivor, opposes the legislation. The No. 2 House Republican said the bill would not have stopped his gunman, who targeted a congressional baseball practice in 2017. The bill would, however, take away the rights of gun owners, he said.</p>\n<h2>How much support does it have?</h2>\n<p>The bills passed out of the <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/news/press-releases/house-judiciary-committee-passes-bipartisan-background-checks-act-charleston\">House Judiciary Committee</a> this month on party-line votes. The House votes are expected to be similar, with just a handful of Republicans likely to vote for the legislation and a handful of Democrats expected to oppose the bills.</p>\n<p>The <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/42\">Senate version</a> of the background check expansion bill has no Republican cosponsors and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R&ndash;Ky., is not expected to call it up for a vote. A similar measure didn&rsquo;t survive a bipartisan filibuster when Democrats ran the Senate in 2013.</p>\n<h2>Why now?</h2>\n<p>Democratic leaders made the legislation an early priority, saying it was a top concern of voters in the 2018 elections.

                "text": "USA TODAY\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The House on Wednesday will hold its first major vote on gun control legislation in years, bringing to the floor two bills aimed at strengthening the background check system for gun purchases.\nThe changes would be the biggest expansion of the system since background checks were first required 25 years ago.\nBut while the Democratic-led House is expected to pass the bills, they\u2019re unlikely to be considered in the GOP-controlled Senate.\nStill, Democrats made the legislation an early priority in part because repeated mass shootings increased advocacy around the issue. That energy and activism helped Democrats retake the House.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the legislation.\nWhat would the bills do?\nOne bill, H.R. 8, would require background checks for private transactions, such as purchases online and at gun shows. Currently, only federally licensed firearms dealers, importers and manufacturers are required to conduct background checks on customers under federal law. (Twenty states and D.C. have already expanded background checks to include at least some private sales.)\nThe other bill, H.R. 1112, would extend to at least 10 days the amount of time firearms dealers must wait for a response from the background check system before the sale can proceed. Currently, they can make the sale if they haven\u2019t received a response in three days.\nWhat are the arguments in favor?\nAdvocates say the bills would close loopholes in the background check system. For example, the gunman who killed nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, had a record that, under the law, would have made him ineligible to buy a gun, according to PolitiFact. But because of clerical errors in the FBI\u2019s database, the background check was still going on after the three-day deadlin so the dealer was able to proceed with the sale.\nAbout one in five gun owners surveyed in 2015 by researchers from Northeastern and Harvard universities said they obtained their guns without a background check \u2013 whether as a gift or through a purchase.\nWould there still be exceptions?\nYes. Family members could still give guns to other close family members without conducting a background check, unless the relative is not legally eligible to own a gun. A gun could be loaned to another person while hunting or on a shooting range, so long as there\u2019s no reason to believe the gun would be used to commit a crime and the borrower is legally allowed to have a gun. Other exceptions include a temporary transfer necessary to prevent \u201cimminent death or great bodily harm.\u201d\nWhat are the arguments against?\nOpponents say background checks are worthless unless they are paired with a national gun registry, and that would intrude on gun owners\u2019 rights. They argue the changes would not have prevented some of the recent mass shootings, such as the 2018 mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., where the defendant had passed a background check. And they say the cost \u2013 up to $125 in some places \u2013 and extra hurdle of getting a background check could be a significant obstacle for those trying to defend themselves.\nWhat do shooting survivors think?\nThe bill expanding background checks, H.R. 8, was introduced on Jan. 8, the eight-year anniversary of the mass shooting in Arizona that left six dead and that severely wounded Rep. Gabby Giffords and 12 others. Giffords, who co\u2013founded a gun\u2013control group after leaving Congress, is lobbying for the legislation on Capitol Hill this week.\nBut Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, another shooting survivor, opposes the legislation. The No. 2 House Republican said the bill would not have stopped his gunman, who targeted a congressional baseball practice in 2017. The bill would, however, take away the rights of gun owners, he said.\nHow much support does it have?\nThe bills passed out of the House Judiciary Committee this month on party-line votes. The House votes are expected to be similar, with just a handful of Republicans likely to vote for the legislation and a handful of Democrats expected to oppose the bills.\nThe Senate version of the background check expansion bill has no Republican cosponsors and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R\u2013Ky., is not expected to call it up for a vote. A similar measure didn\u2019t survive a bipartisan filibuster when Democrats ran the Senate in 2013.\nWhy now?\nDemocratic leaders made the legislation an early priority, saying it was a top concern of voters in the 2018 elections. Gun control groups spent millions backing favored candidates, including Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath, the mother of a son killed in a shooting who was elected to an historically Republican district in Georgia.\nIn what the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics dubbed one of the biggest surprises of the midterm elections, gun control groups outspent pro-gun groups. That was mostly because of a big drop in spending by the National Rifle Association and its affiliates.\nBesides demonstrating quick action, the early timing of the vote has another significance: Thursday is the 25th anniversary of the day the Brady Act, which mandated federal background checks, went into effect.\nHow many sales are denied?\nOf the nearly 197 million firearms-related background checks conducted from when the law went into effect through 2015, about 3 million \u2013 or 1.5 percent \u2013 resulted in denials, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\nDoes the bill have support?\nAn October survey by the Pew Research Center found 91 percent of Democrats and 79 percent of Republicans favored making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.\nContributing: Eliza Collins.\nMore:Parkland shooting spurred a grieving mom to run for Congress.

He admitted to illegally paying hush money to two women who claimed to have had sex with Trump and lying to Congress about the extent of negotiations for a Trump real estate project in Russia.</p>\n<p>The question looming over his testimony will be whether the president himself participated in those crimes.</p>\n<p>A person familiar with Cohen's planned testimony said he was prepared to testify about &quot;criminal conduct&quot; by Trump after he assumed the presidency. The person, who was not authorized to speak publicly, declined to characterize the conduct but said it happened during Trump's first year in the White House.</p>\n<p>Trump has said he was not involved in Cohen's crimes. He argued some of them <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/10/donald-trump-inconsistent-role-michael-cohen-hush-money-stormy-daniels/2262836002/\">weren't crimes at all</a>, and he derided Cohen as <a data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\" href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1073205176872435713\">a &quot;liar&quot; and a &quot;rat.&quot;</a> Both Cohen and the Justice Department have said in court that Trump directed payoffs to two women in the final months of the 2016 campaign. And prosecutors have confirmed that they are scrutinizing the circumstances that led Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.</p>\n<p>The House Oversight and Reform Committee plans to delve widely into Trump's businesses and finances, exploring his debts and payments for the 2016 election, his compliance with campaign finance and tax laws, his business practices, the Trump Foundation and the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Cohen had been an executive vice president and special counsel to the Trump Organization.</p>\n<p>The hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. EST Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Cohen met behind closed doors Tuesday with the Senate Intelligence Committee and is scheduled to appear in private Thursday before the House Intelligence panel. Both of those committees planned to focus their questioning on their investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>&quot;I look forward to tomorrow, to being able to in my voice, to tell the American people my story,&quot; Cohen told reporters as he left the closed-door session. &quot;I&rsquo;m going to let the American people decide exactly who is telling the truth.&quot;</p>\n<p>Asked Tuesday what he hoped to learn from a man who had already confessed to lying to Congress, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence panel, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., replied: &quot;The truth.&quot;</p>\n<p>Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said lawmakers gave Cohen &quot;an extensive grilling&quot; on Tuesday, but she and other lawmakers declined to describe the questions they asked or the answers Cohen provided.</p>\n<p>White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called Cohen a &quot;disgraced felon&quot; and said that &quot;it's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.&quot;</p>\n<p>The oversight chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said Congress has an obligation to conduct independent and robust oversight of the executive branch.</p>\n<p>The hearing, where Cohen is appearing voluntarily after being subpoenaed by the Senate, is not supposed to include questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election, which is being investigated by the House and Senate Intelligence committees and special counsel Robert Mueller.</p>\n<p>Republicans are expected to attack Cohen's credibility.

                "text": "USA TODAY\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Michael Cohen, the pugnacious lawyer and problem-solver for Donald Trump who has confessed to committing crimes for his benefit, is scheduled to testify for the first time in public on Wednesday before members of Congress eager to explore the details of his work for the president.\nCohen has pleaded guilty and agreed to provide evidence to prosecutors in two separate criminal investigations into Trump and those around him. He admitted to illegally paying hush money to two women who claimed to have had sex with Trump and lying to Congress about the extent of negotiations for a Trump real estate project in Russia.\nThe question looming over his testimony will be whether the president himself participated in those crimes.\nA person familiar with Cohen's planned testimony said he was prepared to testify about \"criminal conduct\" by Trump after he assumed the presidency. The person, who was not authorized to speak publicly, declined to characterize the conduct but said it happened during Trump's first year in the White House.\nTrump has said he was not involved in Cohen's crimes. He argued some of them weren't crimes at all, and he derided Cohen as a \"liar\" and a \"rat.\" Both Cohen and the Justice Department have said in court that Trump directed payoffs to two women in the final months of the 2016 campaign. And prosecutors have confirmed that they are scrutinizing the circumstances that led Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.\nThe House Oversight and Reform Committee plans to delve widely into Trump's businesses and finances, exploring his debts and payments for the 2016 election, his compliance with campaign finance and tax laws, his business practices, the Trump Foundation and the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Cohen had been an executive vice president and special counsel to the Trump Organization.\nThe hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. EST Wednesday.\nCohen met behind closed doors Tuesday with the Senate Intelligence Committee and is scheduled to appear in private Thursday before the House Intelligence panel. Both of those committees planned to focus their questioning on their investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\"I look forward to tomorrow, to being able to in my voice, to tell the American people my story,\" Cohen told reporters as he left the closed-door session. \"I\u2019m going to let the American people decide exactly who is telling the truth.\"\nAsked Tuesday what he hoped to learn from a man who had already confessed to lying to Congress, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence panel, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., replied: \"The truth.\"\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said lawmakers gave Cohen \"an extensive grilling\" on Tuesday, but she and other lawmakers declined to describe the questions they asked or the answers Cohen provided.\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called Cohen a \"disgraced felon\" and said that \"it's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.\"\nThe oversight chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said Congress has an obligation to conduct independent and robust oversight of the executive branch.\nThe hearing, where Cohen is appearing voluntarily after being subpoenaed by the Senate, is not supposed to include questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election, which is being investigated by the House and Senate Intelligence committees and special counsel Robert Mueller.\nRepublicans are expected to attack Cohen's credibility. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the panel, expressed disappointment with limits on questions and said he planned to ask Cohen about the crimes he admitted and other activities he refused to disclose. Jordan criticized Democrats for promoting an admitted liar as part of an effort to impeach Trump.\n\u201cMr. Cohen cannot be trusted to partake in honest fact-finding before our body,\u201d Jordan said.\nCohen once declared that he would \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for Trump. Less than a year later, he became one of Trump's main antagonists, providing information to federal prosecutors in two criminal investigations focused on the president.\nIn one of those cases, Cohen pleaded guilty in New York in August to tax evasion, to making false bank statements and to making illegal campaign contributions for paying hush money to two women who said they had sex with Trump.\nCohen also pleaded guilty in Mueller's investigation in November to lying to Congress about talks for a Russian real estate project in what he described as an attempt to reduce attention on Trump's overseas business. He told the House and Senate Intelligence committees that talks ended in January 2016 \u2013 before the Iowa caucuses \u2013 even though talks extended through at least June 2016, when Trump had effectively wrapped up the Republican nomination.\n\u201cThe defendant\u2019s false statements obscured the fact that the Moscow Project was a lucrative business opportunity that sought, and likely required, the assistance of the Russian government,\u201d prosecutors working for Mueller wrote in a court filing in that case. \u201cIf the project was completed, the company could have received hundreds of millions of dollars from Russian sources in licensing fees and other revenues.\u201d\nCohen was sentenced to three years in prison. He is scheduled to surrender May 6.\nCohen had been scheduled to testify earlier, but the sessions were postponed because Cohen said he and his family faced intimidation from Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Trump had tweeted that investigators should watch Cohen\u2019s father-in-law, and Giuliani said in television interviews that the relative \"may have ties to something called organized crime.\"\nContributing: Kevin Johnson\nMore about Michael Cohen and the charges against him:\nCohen takeaways: As Trump's former lawyer heads to prison, political and legal implications grow for White House\nRead Michael Cohen's opening statement to Congress Takeaways from Michael Cohen's testimony on Trump Timeline of Michael Cohen's role in Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump is 'con man' and 'racist' Michael Cohen delivers testimony: 'I am here to tell the truth'",

Shakir said it was a trial period to try out Sirota since Sanders prefers to write his own speeches.\nSirota told The Atlantic that his Twitter purge was the result of an \"autodeleter that periodically and automatically deletes tweets.\" He said he started \"doing this many months ago.\"\nOn Facebook, Sirota told his nearly 10,000 followers that he was taking a role within Sanders' campaign and said it was an opportunity he could not pass up.\n\"I believe journalism is an extremely important and necessary line of work, and I will miss it (and one day in the future, it is possible I may return to it),\" Sirota wrote on Facebook. \"When Bernie asked me to join his campaign, I felt I could not turn that request down, because I genuinely believe that the future of our country, our planet and our children are at stake in this election.\"",

They also need to know why Russia's government would be so invested in Trump&rsquo;s election as president and why Trump has been so solicitous of dictator Vladimir Putin.</p>\n<p>Is Trump in debt to, or reliant on, Russian interests for his business? Does the Russian government have anything incriminating on him? And why have so many former Trump aides and associates lied under oath about their dealings with Russians?</p>\n<p>The American people also deserve a full accounting of how Trump operatives did, or did not, share information designed to undermine the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>With the stakes so high, a summary would be insufficient. Nothing short of the full report &mdash; possibly with some redactions to protect legitimate national security concerns and grand jury testimony &mdash; is acceptable in this case.</p>\n<p>The mere possibility that the Justice Department could sit on the report is highly problematic.</p>\n<p>Many of Mueller&rsquo;s predecessors operated under a post-Watergate law creating investigators, known formally as independent counsels, who had virtually unlimited autonomy.</p>\n<p>When that law was allowed to lapse, it was thought that any administration would face too much political blowback to tamper with or quash a legitimate law enforcement investigation.</p>\n<p>With Trump and his enablers shamelessly attacking Mueller&rsquo;s probe as a &ldquo;witch hunt,&rdquo; that calculation needs to be revisited.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, any effort to sugarcoat or suppress the special counsel's taxpayer-paid findings must not be allowed to stand.</p>\n<p><strong>If you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.</strong></p>",

                "text": "USA TODAY\nPrevious prosecutors investigating presidential scandals have produced lengthy reports, sometimes crammed with more editorializing or salacious details than necessary.\nBut now, when Americans really do want to know exactly what happened in the 2016 election and the degree to which it was influenced by Russian interference, questions are arising about how much information will be made public.\nThe Trump administration has been openly speaking about keeping the report of special counsel Robert Mueller under wraps, releasing only a self-interested summary by Attorney General William Barr, a man who owes his job to President Donald Trump.\nBarr, a Justice Department veteran, promised at his confirmation hearings to release as much information as possible \u2014 consistent with rules and regulations that give the attorney general wide discretion.\nAny effort to sanitize the report that Mueller is said to be finalizing would be a massive political miscalculation and a national travesty.\nThe American people need to know the degree to which their democracy was compromised, and could be compromised again, by a foreign adversary. They also need to know why Russia's government would be so invested in Trump\u2019s election as president and why Trump has been so solicitous of dictator Vladimir Putin.\nIs Trump in debt to, or reliant on, Russian interests for his business? Does the Russian government have anything incriminating on him? And why have so many former Trump aides and associates lied under oath about their dealings with Russians?\nThe American people also deserve a full accounting of how Trump operatives did, or did not, share information designed to undermine the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.\nWith the stakes so high, a summary would be insufficient. Nothing short of the full report \u2014 possibly with some redactions to protect legitimate national security concerns and grand jury testimony \u2014 is acceptable in this case.\nThe mere possibility that the Justice Department could sit on the report is highly problematic.\nMany of Mueller\u2019s predecessors operated under a post-Watergate law creating investigators, known formally as independent counsels, who had virtually unlimited autonomy.\nWhen that law was allowed to lapse, it was thought that any administration would face too much political blowback to tamper with or quash a legitimate law enforcement investigation.\nWith Trump and his enablers shamelessly attacking Mueller\u2019s probe as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d that calculation needs to be revisited.\nIn the meantime, any effort to sugarcoat or suppress the special counsel's taxpayer-paid findings must not be allowed to stand.\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.",

As the second episode of FX&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/04/fosse-verdon-michelle-williams-review,\"><em>Fosse/Verdon</em></a> attests, the choreographer (played by <strong>Sam Rockwell</strong>) met and fell for Gwen Verdon (<strong>Michelle Williams</strong>) while still married to Joan McCracken (<strong>Susan Misner</strong>). Before that, he fell for McCracken while still married to first wife and dance partner Mary Ann Niles. But McCracken stood out from Fosse&rsquo;s revolving door of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/04/gwen-verdon-bob-fosse-fx-marriage\">romantic partners</a>. And, decades after the marriage crumbled, Fosse would call McCracken &ldquo;the biggest influence in my life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She was the one who changed it and gave it direction,&rdquo; Fosse <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=uYslAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=%E2%80%9CShe+was+the+one+who+changed+it+and+gave+it+direction.%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=rR7cbtN4_e&sig=ACfU3U24ZfZRBEB3u6s4EM9ieYitswLZCA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjMwOHUx9XhAhVbJjQIHWm_DH0Q6AEwAXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CShe%20was%20the%20one%20who%20changed%20it%20and%20gave%20it%20direction.%E2%80%9D&f=false\">elaborated</a>. He met McCracken&mdash;who was about a decade older than he was&mdash;when he was still harboring dreams of a career as a dancer. But McCracken was able to size up his ability and re-adjust his ambitions in an instant. &ldquo;She saw that I wasn&rsquo;t going to be Fred Astaire, that I was floundering. So, she persuaded me to knock off for a year and go back to school to study not only dancing but movement, acting, speech, and music.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>McCracken and Fosse met in 1949 while working on the comedy-musical <em>Dance Me a Song.</em> McCracken was one of the stars, while Fosse and Niles were specialty dancers. By that point, McCracken had become a sensation for her ability to merge comedy and dance&mdash;best demonstrated in her &ldquo;Many a New Day&rdquo; pratfall during the original <em>Oklahoma!</em> production. She had a Warner Bros. contract, a sophisticated taste in literature, and an impressive Rolodex that included Truman Capote. (McCracken is rumored to be one of the inspirations for Capote&rsquo;s <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&rsquo;s</em> protagonist.)</p>\n<figure data-event-boundary=\"click\" data-event-click=\"{\" data-in-view=\"{\" data-include-experiments=\"true\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_6CzxyWGj4\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;Joan had a lot of friends,&rdquo; acknowledged Fosse, according to McCracken biographer <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=DtFa_zgI384C&pg=PA179-IA14&lpg=PA179-IA14&dq=%E2%80%9Cartists+and+writers+and+composers,+and+we+would+have+a+party+and+people+like+Truman+Capote+would+be+around.+I%E2%80%99d+just+sit+in+a+corner+and+say+nothing,+and+I+guess+everything+thought+I+was+just+her+trick.+But+I%E2%80%99d+listen+to+this+verbal+dexterity,+and+it+was+another+world.%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=nHBP_ZFcMT&sig=ACfU3U072-73QCvOsI1kWHbAm6-kupvQ-A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwid5s6W5tXhAhViJTQIHUysCU0Q6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9Cartists%20and%20writers%20and%20composers%2C%20and%20we%20would%20have%20a%20party%20and%20people%20like%20Truman%20Capote%20would%20be%20around.%20I%E2%80%99d%20just%20sit%20in%20a%20corner%20and%20say%20nothing%2C%20and%20I%20guess%20everything%20thought%20I%20was%20just%20her%20trick.%20But%20I%E2%80%99d%20listen%20to%20this%20verbal%20dexterity%2C%20and%20it%20was%20another%20world.%E2%80%9D&f=false\"><strong>Lisa Jo Sagolla,</strong></a> 0&ldquo;artists and writers and composers, and we would have a party and people like Truman Capote would be around.

Though McCracken and Fosse tried to keep the romance a secret, Niles soon discovered Fosse was sleeping with one of the show&rsquo;s stars. She wasn&rsquo;t just heartbroken.

                "text": "When it came to Bob Fosse\u2019s love life, there were no clean act breaks. As the second episode of FX\u2019s Fosse/Verdon attests, the choreographer (played by Sam Rockwell) met and fell for Gwen Verdon (Michelle Williams) while still married to Joan McCracken (Susan Misner). Before that, he fell for McCracken while still married to first wife and dance partner Mary Ann Niles. But McCracken stood out from Fosse\u2019s revolving door of romantic partners. And, decades after the marriage crumbled, Fosse would call McCracken \u201cthe biggest influence in my life.\u201d\n\u201cShe was the one who changed it and gave it direction,\u201d Fosse elaborated. He met McCracken\u2014who was about a decade older than he was\u2014when he was still harboring dreams of a career as a dancer. But McCracken was able to size up his ability and re-adjust his ambitions in an instant. \u201cShe saw that I wasn\u2019t going to be Fred Astaire, that I was floundering. So, she persuaded me to knock off for a year and go back to school to study not only dancing but movement, acting, speech, and music.\u201d\nMcCracken and Fosse met in 1949 while working on the comedy-musical Dance Me a Song. McCracken was one of the stars, while Fosse and Niles were specialty dancers. By that point, McCracken had become a sensation for her ability to merge comedy and dance\u2014best demonstrated in her \u201cMany a New Day\u201d pratfall during the original Oklahoma! production. She had a Warner Bros. contract, a sophisticated taste in literature, and an impressive Rolodex that included Truman Capote. (McCracken is rumored to be one of the inspirations for Capote\u2019s Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s protagonist.)\n\u201cJoan had a lot of friends,\u201d acknowledged Fosse, according to McCracken biographer Lisa Jo Sagolla, 0\u201cartists and writers and composers, and we would have a party and people like Truman Capote would be around. I\u2019d just sit in a corner and say nothing, and I guess everyone thought I was just her trick. But I\u2019d listen to this verbal dexterity, and it was another world.\u201d\nAccording to Sagolla, McCracken and Fosse\u2019s affair began during the show\u2019s Boston tryouts. Though McCracken and Fosse tried to keep the romance a secret, Niles soon discovered Fosse was sleeping with one of the show\u2019s stars. She wasn\u2019t just heartbroken. Per Fosse biographer Sam Wasson, \u201cThat McCracken continued to upstage her onstage was a humiliation almost too perverse to bear.\u201d\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH How a Celebrity Trainer Gets Actors in Shape for Movies Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5c17f4642795515e79000027.js?iu=/3379/vanityfair.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://www.vanityfair.com/video/watch/how-a-celebrity-trainer-gets-actors-in-shape-for-movies/\nOur bad!

On an overcast, drizzly morning, he stood on a hill overlooking the Potomac River into Washington, D.C. He had to turn his back on the city to look down at the Cape Cod granite stones surrounding the gray slate tablet and the eternal flame that marked John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s resting place. The capital city behind him represented the present and the future. On the ground before him was the past. It was a personal history that carried obligations, driving him forward into a future he was not always sure he wanted, but that he felt compelled to pursue.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ted Kennedy had inherited a legend along with his name and he was almost as much trapped by the legend as propelled by it,&rdquo; wrote the famous political journalist Teddy White. Edward M. Kennedy had power, fame, and money, and looked the part in his formfitting suit, big-knotted wide tie, and full head of wavy, flamboyant hair. Dark cuff links dotted his wrists. But his face was drawn in on itself. His mouth was closed and slack. His brow was furrowed, pushing down on his eyes, which were half shut and held dark shadows in their recesses. All the lines on his 46-year-old face&mdash;the dimples, the cheekbones&mdash;pointed dramatically toward the center of his anxiety and melancholy: his inaccessible, heavy-lidded eyes.</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just a moment to reflect on his slain brother. It was a trying time for everyone. Since J.F.K.&rsquo;s death, &ldquo;Americans had been abused by history,&rdquo; White wrote. Vietnam, race riots, Watergate, inflation, rising levels of crime and squalor in America&rsquo;s cities. J.F.K. was the last president &ldquo;who had given Americans a sense of control of their own destiny,&rdquo; and he had presided over the nation at a time when the economy was stable and &ldquo;working people grew comfortable and the rich got richer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After J.F.K.&rsquo;s tragic death, Bobby Kennedy took up the torch. He fused the Kennedy glamour with the increasingly progressive spirit of the age. J.F.K. had been conservative on economics and hawkish on foreign policy. When he ran in 1960, Lyndon Johnson had been the &ldquo;New Deal candidate.&rdquo; But after J.F.K.&rsquo;s death, Bobby grafted the J.F.K. legend onto the anti-war, pro-civil-rights passions sweeping through the left.</p>\n<p>Then in 1968, Bobby was killed by a crazed Palestinian who shot him in the head. And suddenly Teddy was the last Kennedy left. He turned down requests to run for president in 1968. Then his disastrous decisions on a summer night in 1969, which resulted in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne on Chappaquiddick Island, made a run in 1972 or 1976 out of the question. But his family name still called to him, and weighed on him, and Teddy thought enough time might have passed to make people forget Chappaquiddick, or forgive him, or feel maybe slightly less disgusted by it.</p>\n<p>Teddy was now 46, the same age that J.F.K. had been in the year of his death. But Jack had been elected president of the United States for three years by that age. Teddy had been a U.S. senator for 16 years, but if he had any plans of following in his brother&rsquo;s footsteps, the clock was ticking. He stood silently, holding a rose.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, Kennedy&rsquo;s plane touched down in Memphis on a Saturday. He stepped onto the tarmac and into frigid cold. The temperature would sink well below freezing that night. Democrats were gathered there in early December for an unusual midterm convention, of which there have been only three in the party&rsquo;s history, in 1974, 1978, and 1982. Democrats held the first one two years after George McGovern failed to stop Richard Nixon from winning a second term in 1972.

                "text": "On November 22, 1978, Teddy Kennedy was alone with his thoughts in Arlington National Cemetery, at the gravesite of his older brother, who had been struck down this very day 15 years earlier. On an overcast, drizzly morning, he stood on a hill overlooking the Potomac River into Washington, D.C. He had to turn his back on the city to look down at the Cape Cod granite stones surrounding the gray slate tablet and the eternal flame that marked John F. Kennedy\u2019s resting place. The capital city behind him represented the present and the future. On the ground before him was the past. It was a personal history that carried obligations, driving him forward into a future he was not always sure he wanted, but that he felt compelled to pursue.\n\u201cTed Kennedy had inherited a legend along with his name and he was almost as much trapped by the legend as propelled by it,\u201d wrote the famous political journalist Teddy White. Edward M. Kennedy had power, fame, and money, and looked the part in his formfitting suit, big-knotted wide tie, and full head of wavy, flamboyant hair. Dark cuff links dotted his wrists. But his face was drawn in on itself. His mouth was closed and slack. His brow was furrowed, pushing down on his eyes, which were half shut and held dark shadows in their recesses. All the lines on his 46-year-old face\u2014the dimples, the cheekbones\u2014pointed dramatically toward the center of his anxiety and melancholy: his inaccessible, heavy-lidded eyes.\nIt wasn\u2019t just a moment to reflect on his slain brother. It was a trying time for everyone. Since J.F.K.\u2019s death, \u201cAmericans had been abused by history,\u201d White wrote. Vietnam, race riots, Watergate, inflation, rising levels of crime and squalor in America\u2019s cities. J.F.K. was the last president \u201cwho had given Americans a sense of control of their own destiny,\u201d and he had presided over the nation at a time when the economy was stable and \u201cworking people grew comfortable and the rich got richer.\u201d\nAfter J.F.K.\u2019s tragic death, Bobby Kennedy took up the torch. He fused the Kennedy glamour with the increasingly progressive spirit of the age. J.F.K. had been conservative on economics and hawkish on foreign policy. When he ran in 1960, Lyndon Johnson had been the \u201cNew Deal candidate.\u201d But after J.F.K.\u2019s death, Bobby grafted the J.F.K. legend onto the anti-war, pro-civil-rights passions sweeping through the left.\nThen in 1968, Bobby was killed by a crazed Palestinian who shot him in the head. And suddenly Teddy was the last Kennedy left. He turned down requests to run for president in 1968. Then his disastrous decisions on a summer night in 1969, which resulted in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne on Chappaquiddick Island, made a run in 1972 or 1976 out of the question. But his family name still called to him, and weighed on him, and Teddy thought enough time might have passed to make people forget Chappaquiddick, or forgive him, or feel maybe slightly less disgusted by it.\nTeddy was now 46, the same age that J.F.K. had been in the year of his death. But Jack had been elected president of the United States for three years by that age. Teddy had been a U.S. senator for 16 years, but if he had any plans of following in his brother\u2019s footsteps, the clock was ticking. He stood silently, holding a rose.\nTwo weeks later, Kennedy\u2019s plane touched down in Memphis on a Saturday. He stepped onto the tarmac and into frigid cold. The temperature would sink well below freezing that night. Democrats were gathered there in early December for an unusual midterm convention, of which there have been only three in the party\u2019s history, in 1974, 1978, and 1982. Democrats held the first one two years after George McGovern failed to stop Richard Nixon from winning a second term in 1972. The midterm convention was symbolic of a party that was trying desperately to avoid disintegration. The miserable weather in the River City matched the mood of the Democratic Party and the nation.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH How a Celebrity Trainer Gets Actors in Shape for Movies Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5c17f4642795515e79000027.js?iu=/3379/vanityfair.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://www.vanityfair.com/video/watch/how-a-celebrity-trainer-gets-actors-in-shape-for-movies/\nOur bad!

Though they&rsquo;d been hiring staffers for Sanders&rsquo;s second shot at the White House, they&rsquo;ve decided to part ways because &ldquo;we believe that Sen. Sanders deserves to have media consultants who share his creative vision for the campaign,&rdquo; according to a joint statement.</p>\n<p>The nature of those creative differences is unclear, though the shake-up follows reports that Sanders&rsquo;s 2016 leadership ignored <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-sexism.html\">allegations of sexism</a> and a <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-sexism.html\">gender pay gap</a>.

In December, as Sanders was preparing to announce his presidential bid, numerous 2016 alumni <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/30/bernie-sanders-campaign-harassment-1077014\">published a letter</a> asking the 2020 team to address the &ldquo;predatory culture&rdquo; of the previous campaign and a lack of diversity at the senior level.

Longabaugh built out a strong delegate-hunting strategy; Devine became one of Sanders&rsquo;s most prominent advocates on the cable-news circuit; and Mulvey served as the campaign&rsquo;s creative director, putting together a <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://qz.com/593653/bernie-sanders-ads-are-killing-it-with-democrats-and-independents/\">notable series of television ads</a> that included &ldquo;America,&rdquo; an annoyingly effective, heart-tugging video set to the famous Simon &amp; Garfunkel song.

In 2014, he told The Washington Post that Sanders would be a strong candidate, predicting that he would \u201cdeliver an enormously powerful message that the country is waiting to hear right now, and do it in a way that succeeds.\u201d\nThe firm remained connected to Sanders until recently, and produced the video that announced his 2020 run. But it also faced criticism, according to NBC News, including from Sanders allies, for the somewhat-swampy $5.3 million in payments D.M.L. received from the campaign. (In a statement, Shakir said the Sanders campaign \u201cappreciates all the good work D.M.L. has done and wishes them well.\u201d)\nOn the plus side, Sanders will be able to dodge questions about Devine\u2019s ties to Paul Manafort, whom he worked with in the late 2000s when they both consulted for pro-Russian Ukrainian politician Viktor Yanukovych. Devine ended his business relationship with Manafort and Yanukovych several years ago, citing his discomfort with Yanukovych throwing his political opponent in prison. Last year, he testified against Manafort when the former Trump campaign manager was put on trial for bank- and tax-fraud charges.\n\u2014 Ivanka Trump: Americans want to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, just like me\n\u2014 Reading between Mueller\u2019s lines: is the story of Russian collusion hiding in plain sight?\n\u2014 Bernie Sanders is already repeating some crucial 2016 mistakes\n\u2014 Look at these Oscar party photos!\nLooking for more?

While both he and McCain began the Trump presidency as sworn protectors of the conservative flame, Graham seemed to recognize the political advantages of sycophancy&mdash;or, at the very least, that there were few benefits to sanctimony. While one of McCain&rsquo;s last acts in the Senate was to cast a decisive vote against the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, Graham was solidifying his friendship with Trump on the links. &ldquo;How bad did he beat me? I did better in the presidential race than today on the golf course!&rdquo; Graham <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://twitter.com/lindseygrahamsc/status/917497714111283201?lang=en\">tweeted</a> in October 2017. &ldquo;Great fun. Great host.&rdquo; With the exception of Graham&rsquo;s implacably neocon views on keeping U.S. troops in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, his Twitter account has become largely indistinguishable from any other Trump supplicant&mdash;prompting many in Washington to ask, what the hell happened to Lindsey Graham?</p>\n<p>Graham offers an explanation of sorts in a <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/magazine/lindsey-graham-what-happened-trump.html\">weirdly candid interview</a> with swamp chronicler <strong>Mark Leibovich</strong> for <em>The New York Times Magazine.</em> For one, Graham says he has a duty to his constituents to advance Republican policy, and Donald Trump is a Republican president. More important, Graham argues, his close friendship with Trump has allowed him to influence the president on such topics as Syria (where Trump has agitated to remove all U.S. troops) and Venezuela. &ldquo;From my point of view,&rdquo; Graham tells Leibovich, &ldquo;if you know anything about me, it&rsquo;d be odd not to do this.&rdquo; Asked what &ldquo;this&rdquo; refers to, Graham responds bluntly: &ldquo;try to be relevant.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t such a strange notion, and it&rsquo;s certainly something that plenty of Republicans have grappled with in the Trump era. During the Republican primary, the majority of the Washington Establishment rejected Trump and Trumpism. (<strong>Rick Perry,</strong> who now serves as Trump&rsquo;s secretary of Energy, previously described Trump as a &ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/17/mick-mulvaney-once-called-trump-terrible-human-being-others-close-president-have-said-much-worse/?utm_term=.b77d85377e45\">cancer on conservatism</a>.&rdquo; <strong>Mick Mulvaney,</strong> who is now White House acting chief of staff, called Trump &ldquo;a terrible human being.&rdquo;) Since the election, however, the majority of Republican lawmakers have come around to the position that they can get more done working with Trump than against him. Many of them like him, on a personal level. Those who didn&rsquo;t drink the Kool-Aid, like <strong>Jeff Flake</strong> and <strong>Bob Corker,</strong> have since retired.</p>\n<p>Graham commits some light historical revisionism, however, when he justifies his own transformation by suggesting that McCain&mdash;who spent his twilight days <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mccain-s-farewell-message-n904171\">assailing Trump&rsquo;s presidency</a>&mdash;would have approved:</p>\n<blockquote data-event-boundary=\"click\" data-event-click=\"{\" data-in-view=\"{\" data-include-experiments=\"true\"><p>Graham told me that McCain understood his willingness to make peace with Trump, though the extent of Graham&rsquo;s ingratiation bothered him a bit&mdash;especially Graham&rsquo;s over-the-top praise for Trump&rsquo;s golfing abilities.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote data-event-boundary=\"click\" data-event-click=\"{\" data-in-view=\"{\" data-include-experiments=\"true\"><p>But McCain, more than anyone, knew the value of reconciliation. Like Graham, he was a mostly reliable Republican vote in the Senate and supported Trump&rsquo;s agenda on most issues besides repealing the Affordable Care Act. Aside from McCain, Graham said, &ldquo;I never met anyone in my whole life that could hold a grudge and move on at the same time.&rdquo; And McCain, he said, understood better than anyone that few things are more potent in politics than having access to a president, regardless of which one.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5c17f4642795515e79000027/5a5ffcd2-7212-4fbf-9b9f-3570244ce5echigh.mp4?videoIndex=0&requester=oo\"><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video><iframe src=\"https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.365.1_en.html#goog_1714492351\"></iframe><video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5c17f4642795515e79000027/5a5ffcd2-7212-4fbf-9b9f-3570244ce5ecthumbs.mp4\"></video><h4>EMBED URL</h4><h4>VIDEO URL</h4><h4>Our bad!

                "text": "Senator Lindsey Graham, perhaps unmoored after the death of his close friend John McCain, has spiraled ever more tightly into the emetic orbit of President Donald Trump, a man he once described as a \u201crace-baiting, xenophobic bigot,\u201d but now defends with the sort of ardent passion he previously reserved for America\u2019s forever wars in the Middle East. While both he and McCain began the Trump presidency as sworn protectors of the conservative flame, Graham seemed to recognize the political advantages of sycophancy\u2014or, at the very least, that there were few benefits to sanctimony. While one of McCain\u2019s last acts in the Senate was to cast a decisive vote against the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, Graham was solidifying his friendship with Trump on the links. \u201cHow bad did he beat me? I did better in the presidential race than today on the golf course!\u201d Graham tweeted in October 2017. \u201cGreat fun. Great host.\u201d With the exception of Graham\u2019s implacably neocon views on keeping U.S. troops in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, his Twitter account has become largely indistinguishable from any other Trump supplicant\u2014prompting many in Washington to ask, what the hell happened to Lindsey Graham?\nGraham offers an explanation of sorts in a weirdly candid interview with swamp chronicler Mark Leibovich for The New York Times Magazine. For one, Graham says he has a duty to his constituents to advance Republican policy, and Donald Trump is a Republican president. More important, Graham argues, his close friendship with Trump has allowed him to influence the president on such topics as Syria (where Trump has agitated to remove all U.S. troops) and Venezuela. \u201cFrom my point of view,\u201d Graham tells Leibovich, \u201cif you know anything about me, it\u2019d be odd not to do this.\u201d Asked what \u201cthis\u201d refers to, Graham responds bluntly: \u201ctry to be relevant.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t such a strange notion, and it\u2019s certainly something that plenty of Republicans have grappled with in the Trump era. During the Republican primary, the majority of the Washington Establishment rejected Trump and Trumpism. (Rick Perry, who now serves as Trump\u2019s secretary of Energy, previously described Trump as a \u201ccancer on conservatism.\u201d Mick Mulvaney, who is now White House acting chief of staff, called Trump \u201ca terrible human being.\u201d) Since the election, however, the majority of Republican lawmakers have come around to the position that they can get more done working with Trump than against him. Many of them like him, on a personal level. Those who didn\u2019t drink the Kool-Aid, like Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, have since retired.\nGraham commits some light historical revisionism, however, when he justifies his own transformation by suggesting that McCain\u2014who spent his twilight days assailing Trump\u2019s presidency\u2014would have approved:\nGraham told me that McCain understood his willingness to make peace with Trump, though the extent of Graham\u2019s ingratiation bothered him a bit\u2014especially Graham\u2019s over-the-top praise for Trump\u2019s golfing abilities.\nBut McCain, more than anyone, knew the value of reconciliation. Like Graham, he was a mostly reliable Republican vote in the Senate and supported Trump\u2019s agenda on most issues besides repealing the Affordable Care Act. Aside from McCain, Graham said, \u201cI never met anyone in my whole life that could hold a grudge and move on at the same time.\u201d And McCain, he said, understood better than anyone that few things are more potent in politics than having access to a president, regardless of which one.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH How a Celebrity Trainer Gets Actors in Shape for Movies Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5c17f4642795515e79000027.js?iu=/3379/vanityfair.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://www.vanityfair.com/video/watch/how-a-celebrity-trainer-gets-actors-in-shape-for-movies/\nOur bad!

But Kim, in Trump&rsquo;s mind, wasn&rsquo;t one of them. (As a reminder, we&rsquo;re talking about a guy who runs a country that&rsquo;s been <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44234505\">described</a> as &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s biggest open prison camp,&rdquo; who&rsquo;s <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-starving-his-people-pay-nuclear-weapons-573015\">starved his own people to pay for nuclear weapons</a>, and who <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/06/world/asia/kim-korea-image.html\">ordered the execution of his half brother and uncle</a>.)</p>\n<p>Trump, of course, has a vested interest in flattering Kim. The two are currently rubbing shoulders in Vietnam, at a summit that <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/26/18240805/trump-north-korea-kim-vietnam-deal\">no one expects will yield much of anything for the U.S.</a>, save for, <em>at best,</em> a &ldquo;gesture that would help signal that Kim may actually be serious about dismantling [his nuclear] program eventually.&rdquo; As a leader for whom ass-kissing goes <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/743645/everyone-figured-how-susceptible-trump-flattery--except-trump\">a very long way</a>, Trump presumably expects the strategy to work on his little authoritarian friend.

Last year, he <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/11/politics/trump-kim-summit-singapore/index.html\">told</a> reporters how impressed he was with Kim&rsquo;s ability to &ldquo;take over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and run it, and run it tough,&rdquo; and earlier this month he informed his followers that an economic miracle is about to take place in North Korea&mdash;one that only he saw coming.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://mailchi.mp/ca902df1708a/levin-report\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Nothing to see here, just a Republican representative and Trump ally taunting a witness the day before he&rsquo;s scheduled to testify before Congress</strong></p>\n<p>Cohen, Trump&rsquo;s former fixer, is <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/26/michael-cohen-testimony-congress-1186702\">expected</a> to &ldquo;offer up a document to lawmakers&rdquo; during his congressional testimony tomorrow &ldquo;that he claims will show the president engaged in criminal conduct related to a hush-money payment to porn star <strong>Stormy Daniels.</strong>&ldquo; According to a recent report from <em>The New York Times,</em> Gaetz <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-investigations.html\">decided</a> in 2017 that it was his duty to attack the special counsel&rsquo;s investigation into Trump, a burden he apparently continues to carry in 2019.

                "text": "As you\u2019ve probably noticed by now, Donald Trump has a thing for dictators. While America\u2019s long-standing allies have received nothing but scorn from him for the last two years, the real-estate developer turned president can\u2019t get enough of strongmen whose brutal tactics he\u2019d love nothing more than to adopt in the U.S. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan; Rodrigo Duterte; Vladimir Putin; Mohammed bin Salman\u2014he loves \u2019em all. But while he\u2019s utterly devoted to Putin for reasons that may soon be revealed, and dotes on M.B.S. to the point that the Saudis were given a free pass on murder by bone saw, there\u2019s one authoritarian who seems to have truly stolen Trump\u2019s heart: Kim Jong Un. After a slightly rocky start, the president of the United States appears to be uniquely obsessed with his North Korean friend, whose correspondence he carries around, and with whom he told supporters he \u201cfell in love.\u201d In fact, Trump is so smitten that whereas other people see a barbaric murderer, he evidently sees a stand-up young man from whom Don Jr. could learn a thi ng or two.\nAccording to new report from CNN, the last time the two leaders met, Trump told Kim that he\u2019d known \u201cplenty of people who\u2019d grown up wealthy and whose families were powerful,\u201d life circumstances that led to them being total f--kups. But Kim, in Trump\u2019s mind, wasn\u2019t one of them. (As a reminder, we\u2019re talking about a guy who runs a country that\u2019s been described as \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest open prison camp,\u201d who\u2019s starved his own people to pay for nuclear weapons, and who ordered the execution of his half brother and uncle.)\nTrump, of course, has a vested interest in flattering Kim. The two are currently rubbing shoulders in Vietnam, at a summit that no one expects will yield much of anything for the U.S., save for, at best, a \u201cgesture that would help signal that Kim may actually be serious about dismantling [his nuclear] program eventually.\u201d As a leader for whom ass-kissing goes a very long way, Trump presumably expects the strategy to work on his little authoritarian friend. None of which is to say he doesn\u2019t truly believe that Kim is an accomplished dictator people should look up to. Last year, he told reporters how impressed he was with Kim\u2019s ability to \u201ctake over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and run it, and run it tough,\u201d and earlier this month he informed his followers that an economic miracle is about to take place in North Korea\u2014one that only he saw coming.\nIf you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click here to subscribe.\nNothing to see here, just a Republican representative and Trump ally taunting a witness the day before he\u2019s scheduled to testify before Congress\nCohen, Trump\u2019s former fixer, is expected to \u201coffer up a document to lawmakers\u201d during his congressional testimony tomorrow \u201cthat he claims will show the president engaged in criminal conduct related to a hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.\u201c According to a recent report from The New York Times, Gaetz decided in 2017 that it was his duty to attack the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Trump, a burden he apparently continues to carry in 2019. When asked about his threat against Cohen on Tuesday, the congressman told a reporter from Vox to stay tuned for \u201cfireworks\u201d tomorrow. In an interview with the Daily Beast, Gaetz insisted he was merely \u201cchallenging the veracity and character of a witness,\u201d and that \u201cthis is what it looks like to compete in the marketplace of ideas,\u201d which is an interesting euphemism for We\u2019re gonna tell everyone about your who-ores.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH How a Celebrity Trainer Gets Actors in Shape for Movies Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5c17f4642795515e79000027.js?iu=/3379/vanityfair.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://www.vanityfair.com/video/watch/how-a-celebrity-trainer-gets-actors-in-shape-for-movies/\nOur bad!

In a <em>Washington Post</em> <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/25/i-support-trumps-vision-border-security-i-would-vote-against-emergency/?utm_term=.c59e9099e2c4\">op-ed</a>, Tillis said he supports Trump&rsquo;s border-security agenda, but is concerned about the precedent such an end around would establish. &ldquo;As a U.S. senator, I cannot justify providing the executive with more ways to bypass Congress,&rdquo; Tillis wrote. &ldquo;As a conservative, I cannot endorse a precedent that I know future left-wing presidents will exploit to advance radical policies that will erode economic and individual freedoms.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump cannot afford one more defection in the Senate, or he&rsquo;ll be forced to issue his first veto. Republicans <strong>Susan Collins</strong> and <strong>Lisa Murkowski</strong> have already announced their support for the resolution, which will almost certainly pass the Democratically controlled House on Tuesday. The G.O.P. controls the Senate, but four Republicans voting with the Democrats would be enough to send <strong>Joaquin Castro&rsquo;s</strong> resolution to the president&rsquo;s desk&mdash;a rebuke that would prove embarrassing for Trump.</p>\n<p>Presumably eyeing the narrowing gap, the president has begun lobbying his party ahead of the vote, tweeting Monday that he &ldquo;hope[s] our great Republican Senators don&rsquo;t get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be strong and smart,&rdquo; Trump wrote. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fall into the Democrats &lsquo;trap&rsquo; of Open Borders and Crime!&rdquo; Democrats, too, have been working to drum up support behind the scenes, Politico <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/trump-national-emergency-republicans-1185526\">reports</a>, noting that leaders have circulated a spreadsheet to Republicans outlining the various military projects the president could pull money from to fund his wall. That may be helping to goose Republicans&rsquo; concerns about Trump&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;emergency,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s not clear whether it will be enough to turn them against the president&rsquo;s overreach.</p>\n<p>As Politico <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/trump-national-emergency-congress-1185589\">noted</a> Monday night, even Republicans who have expressed opposition to Trump&rsquo;s use of the nuclear option&mdash;<strong>John Cornyn</strong> and <strong>Chuck Grassley,</strong> for example&mdash;have signaled they&rsquo;ll stand with the president. Other Republican critics of the move, like the wishy-washy <strong>Marco Rubio,</strong> claim not to have read the one-page resolution. Others told the outlet that they &ldquo;despise&rdquo; Trump&rsquo;s unilateral move as much as Tillis does, but are wary of running afoul of the president. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want it to come to this, because I think it&rsquo;s probably going to get tied up in court. And I said it wasn&rsquo;t a practical solution,&rdquo; Cornyn said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m probably going to come down on the side of voting against the resolution of disapproval.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That means the most viable path to blocking Trump&rsquo;s emergency declaration is likely the courts, where several states have already filed a lawsuit against the administration. Still, a formal rebuke of the president by Congress would be a significant symbolic victory, and a further sign of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/dozens-of-national-security-experts-call-bs-on-trumps-border-emergency\">bipartisan opposition</a> to what <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> has slammed as a &ldquo;fake emergency.&rdquo; &ldquo;Every Member of Congress swears an oath to protect &amp; defend the Constitution,&rdquo; Pelosi <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1100157795960262658\">tweeted</a> early Monday evening. &ldquo;We must not abandon that responsibility now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&mdash; A Republican <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/bill-weld-2020-republican-primary-challenge?inline\">mission to stop Trump?</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Howard Schultz defends <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/howard-schultz-i-firmly-believe-americans-want-a-president-just-like-me?inline\">his controversial potential presidential bid</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; The suspected leaker of Jeff Bezos&rsquo;s texts has his own <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/suspected-bezos-leaker-supplies-his-own-theory-about-the-affair?inline\">theory about the affair</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; The shocking details behind the double <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/abducted-in-plain-sight-netflix-jan-broberg?inline\">kidnapping of an Idaho teen</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>\n<figure><figure> <video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5c17f4642795515e79000027/5a5ffcd2-7212-4fbf-9b9f-3570244ce5echigh.mp4?videoIndex=0&requester=oo\"><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video><iframe src=\"https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.365.1_en.html#goog_1144007351\"></iframe><video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5c17f4642795515e79000027/5a5ffcd2-7212-4fbf-9b9f-3570244ce5ecthumbs.mp4\"></video> WATCH How a Celebrity Trainer Gets Actors in Shape for Movies Share Tweet Email More... <h4>EMBED URL</h4>&lt;script async src=&quot;//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5c17f4642795515e79000027.js?iu=/3379/vanityfair.dart/share&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<h4>VIDEO URL</h4>https://www.vanityfair.com/video/watch/how-a-celebrity-trainer-gets-actors-in-shape-for-movies/ <img src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5c17f4642795515e79000027/5a5ffcd2-7212-4fbf-9b9f-3570244ce5echigh.mp4?videoIndex=0&requester=oo\"></img> <h4>This live video has ended.

                "text": "Republican Senator Thom Tillis on Monday evening announced his support for a Democratic resolution to block Donald Trump\u2019s emergency declaration, bringing the president to the threshold of a humiliating defeat. In a Washington Post op-ed, Tillis said he supports Trump\u2019s border-security agenda, but is concerned about the precedent such an end around would establish. \u201cAs a U.S. senator, I cannot justify providing the executive with more ways to bypass Congress,\u201d Tillis wrote. \u201cAs a conservative, I cannot endorse a precedent that I know future left-wing presidents will exploit to advance radical policies that will erode economic and individual freedoms.\u201d\nTrump cannot afford one more defection in the Senate, or he\u2019ll be forced to issue his first veto. Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have already announced their support for the resolution, which will almost certainly pass the Democratically controlled House on Tuesday. The G.O.P. controls the Senate, but four Republicans voting with the Democrats would be enough to send Joaquin Castro\u2019s resolution to the president\u2019s desk\u2014a rebuke that would prove embarrassing for Trump.\nPresumably eyeing the narrowing gap, the president has begun lobbying his party ahead of the vote, tweeting Monday that he \u201chope[s] our great Republican Senators don\u2019t get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security.\u201d \u201cBe strong and smart,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t fall into the Democrats \u2018trap\u2019 of Open Borders and Crime!\u201d Democrats, too, have been working to drum up support behind the scenes, Politico reports, noting that leaders have circulated a spreadsheet to Republicans outlining the various military projects the president could pull money from to fund his wall. That may be helping to goose Republicans\u2019 concerns about Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cemergency,\u201d but it\u2019s not clear whether it will be enough to turn them against the president\u2019s overreach.\nAs Politico noted Monday night, even Republicans who have expressed opposition to Trump\u2019s use of the nuclear option\u2014John Cornyn and Chuck Grassley, for example\u2014have signaled they\u2019ll stand with the president. Other Republican critics of the move, like the wishy-washy Marco Rubio, claim not to have read the one-page resolution. Others told the outlet that they \u201cdespise\u201d Trump\u2019s unilateral move as much as Tillis does, but are wary of running afoul of the president. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to come to this, because I think it\u2019s probably going to get tied up in court. And I said it wasn\u2019t a practical solution,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to come down on the side of voting against the resolution of disapproval.\u201d\nThat means the most viable path to blocking Trump\u2019s emergency declaration is likely the courts, where several states have already filed a lawsuit against the administration. Still, a formal rebuke of the president by Congress would be a significant symbolic victory, and a further sign of bipartisan opposition to what Nancy Pelosi has slammed as a \u201cfake emergency.\u201d \u201cEvery Member of Congress swears an oath to protect & defend the Constitution,\u201d Pelosi tweeted early Monday evening. \u201cWe must not abandon that responsibility now.\u201d\n\u2014 A Republican mission to stop Trump?\n\u2014 Howard Schultz defends his controversial potential presidential bid\n\u2014 The suspected leaker of Jeff Bezos\u2019s texts has his own theory about the affair\n\u2014 The shocking details behind the double kidnapping of an Idaho teen\nLooking for more?

We know all about what the Betophobes think. They&rsquo;ve signaled their distaste for presidential candidate <strong>Beto O&rsquo;Rourke</strong> in tweets, <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/opinion/sunday/beto-orourke-2020.html\">op-eds</a>, and mocking <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2019/03/17/20190317_154205.htm\">headlines</a>. But what about the Betophiles? They&rsquo;re quiet. Some of us, this writer included, wondered if they existed outside of a narrow bubble of journalists. Imagine the surprise, then, when it emerged this week that Beto&rsquo;s supporters took only 24 hours to put <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-crushes-the-skeptics-beneath-a-giant-pile-of-cash\">over $6 million in O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s coffers</a>, a speed record surpassing that of any Democrat in the 2020 race. It was a reminder, if we needed one, that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/how-the-democrats-can-stop-nuking-themselves-and-start-obliterating-trump\">Twitter isn&rsquo;t America</a> or Democrats, and neither is the press.</p>\n<p>Beto O&rsquo;Rourke is running on a platform that&rsquo;s vague, and, for both Betophiles and Betophobes, it&rsquo;s the lack of ideology that attracts or repels them. Beto <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-orourke-cover-story\">told this publication</a>, &ldquo;I think it is my ability to listen to people, to help bring people together to do something that is thought to be impossible.&rdquo; Of course, one reason things can be impossible is that most people don&rsquo;t want them to happen. But leave that aside. Anyone who remembers 2008 will recognize the echoes of <strong>Barack Obama,</strong> who offered &ldquo;unity over division&rdquo; and similar promises. One lesson that should have been learned is that it&rsquo;s a mistake to campaign as a unifier, because the other side will be eager to prove you wrong. But maybe Beto offers a new twist on it.</p>\n<p>Let us move now to the other centrist white male in the 2020 race: <strong>Joe Biden.</strong> Should Biden be afraid of Beto? To be sure, the idea that &ldquo;centrist white male&rdquo; is a slot with insufficient room for two would have seemed odd three or four elections ago. In 2004, there was little else. (<strong>John Kerry, Howard Dean, John Edwards, Joe Lieberman,</strong> and <strong>Wesley Clark</strong>&mdash;these were seen as the leading hopefuls, and <strong>Dennis Kucinich, Al Sharpton,</strong> or <strong>Carol Moseley Braun</strong> languished on the margins.) But the elections of Barack Obama and <strong>Donald Trump</strong>&mdash;along with a strong showing by <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> in 2016&mdash;changed people&rsquo;s sense of what&rsquo;s possible and what&rsquo;s advantageous. Centrism and whiteness and maleness may all be liabilities more than strengths. For someone like Biden, therefore, a young and charismatic candidate borrowing a lot of the Obama vibe is a hazard, making a tough hand worse. Biden can at best offer Obama continuity. He cannot offer the vibe.</p>\n<p>You could say that Biden has many of Beto&rsquo;s centrist vulnerabilities along with extra liabilities: a longer record, less wokeness fluency, and a tendency, in the words of Barack Obama, &ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/double-down-game-change-joe-biden-hillary-clinton-099204\">to say something stupid</a>.&rdquo; On the last of these points, Biden told a crowd over the weekend that he had &ldquo;the most progressive record of anybody running for&rdquo;&mdash;stopping abruptly to change that to &ldquo;anybody who would run.&rdquo; If Biden is looking to play the sphinx and then wow the field by jumping in late, slips like that don&rsquo;t help. One is reminded of the Far Side cartoon of an alien visitor falling down the stairs on the way to greet mankind. &ldquo;So much for instilling them with a sense of awe,&rdquo; reads the caption.</p>\n<p>For all of Biden&rsquo;s flaws, though, he&rsquo;s still in a stronger position than Beto, because he represents a larger share of Democrats and consequently is <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\">leading every poll</a>. That is to say, he appeals to those who love Barack Obama, hate Donald Trump, and pay scant attention to news about politics.

                "text": "Little did we know that Americans would be dividing themselves into Betophobes and Betophiles. We know all about what the Betophobes think. They\u2019ve signaled their distaste for presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke in tweets, op-eds, and mocking headlines. But what about the Betophiles? They\u2019re quiet. Some of us, this writer included, wondered if they existed outside of a narrow bubble of journalists. Imagine the surprise, then, when it emerged this week that Beto\u2019s supporters took only 24 hours to put over $6 million in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s coffers, a speed record surpassing that of any Democrat in the 2020 race. It was a reminder, if we needed one, that Twitter isn\u2019t America or Democrats, and neither is the press.\nBeto O\u2019Rourke is running on a platform that\u2019s vague, and, for both Betophiles and Betophobes, it\u2019s the lack of ideology that attracts or repels them. Beto told this publication, \u201cI think it is my ability to listen to people, to help bring people together to do something that is thought to be impossible.\u201d Of course, one reason things can be impossible is that most people don\u2019t want them to happen. But leave that aside. Anyone who remembers 2008 will recognize the echoes of Barack Obama, who offered \u201cunity over division\u201d and similar promises. One lesson that should have been learned is that it\u2019s a mistake to campaign as a unifier, because the other side will be eager to prove you wrong. But maybe Beto offers a new twist on it.\nLet us move now to the other centrist white male in the 2020 race: Joe Biden. Should Biden be afraid of Beto? To be sure, the idea that \u201ccentrist white male\u201d is a slot with insufficient room for two would have seemed odd three or four elections ago. In 2004, there was little else. (John Kerry, Howard Dean, John Edwards, Joe Lieberman, and Wesley Clark\u2014these were seen as the leading hopefuls, and Dennis Kucinich, Al Sharpton, or Carol Moseley Braun languished on the margins.) But the elections of Barack Obama and Donald Trump\u2014along with a strong showing by Bernie Sanders in 2016\u2014changed people\u2019s sense of what\u2019s possible and what\u2019s advantageous. Centrism and whiteness and maleness may all be liabilities more than strengths. For someone like Biden, therefore, a young and charismatic candidate borrowing a lot of the Obama vibe is a hazard, making a tough hand worse. Biden can at best offer Obama continuity. He cannot offer the vibe.\nYou could say that Biden has many of Beto\u2019s centrist vulnerabilities along with extra liabilities: a longer record, less wokeness fluency, and a tendency, in the words of Barack Obama, \u201cto say something stupid.\u201d On the last of these points, Biden told a crowd over the weekend that he had \u201cthe most progressive record of anybody running for\u201d\u2014stopping abruptly to change that to \u201canybody who would run.\u201d If Biden is looking to play the sphinx and then wow the field by jumping in late, slips like that don\u2019t help. One is reminded of the Far Side cartoon of an alien visitor falling down the stairs on the way to greet mankind. \u201cSo much for instilling them with a sense of awe,\u201d reads the caption.\nFor all of Biden\u2019s flaws, though, he\u2019s still in a stronger position than Beto, because he represents a larger share of Democrats and consequently is leading every poll. That is to say, he appeals to those who love Barack Obama, hate Donald Trump, and pay scant attention to news about politics. That may not be the reader of an article like this, but it\u2019s people we all know. Beto, by contrast, would appeal to a smaller part of Obama\u2019s coalition: those who pay close attention to politics but not policy and loved Obama for his manner and style. This isn\u2019t meaningless. Many Americans felt proud to have Obama representing their country to the world. The head of state sets a tone, and we feel it fast when that tone becomes appalling. But it tends to recede as a priority in the face of other problems.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH How a Celebrity Trainer Gets Actors in Shape for Movies Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5c17f4642795515e79000027.js?iu=/3379/vanityfair.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://www.vanityfair.com/video/watch/how-a-celebrity-trainer-gets-actors-in-shape-for-movies/\nThis live video has ended.

                "text": "The uneasy rift between White House adviser Kellyanne Conway and her husband, the indefatigable Trump critic George Conway, appeared to widen this weekend, when Kellyanne was forced to address their difference of opinion on the record. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t share those concerns,\u201d she told reporters Monday morning, referring to a series of tweets in which her husband suggested that her boss has a diagnosable mental disorder and that his \u201ccondition is getting worse.\u201d She added, of the tweets, \u201cI have four kids and I was getting them out of the house this morning before I got here so I can talk to the president about substance, so I may not be up to speed on all of them.\u201d\nFor close observers, the Conways\u2019 divided household is a source of endless fascination\u2014and a microcosm of America\u2019s partisan split. Kellyanne, who steered Trump\u2019s campaign, became infamous early on for her ardent and recursive defenses, characterized by reality-bending personal attacks on those who dared question the president. Meanwhile George, a lawyer, has become a full-time Trump critic. Over the weekend, while Trump rage-tweeted about Saturday Night Live, George launched a heretofore unprecedented offensive, tweeting pages from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, including an entry for \u201cNarcissistic Personality Disorder: a pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and lack of empathy.\u201d\nGeorge Conway also re-tweeted media and political figures skeptical of the president\u2019s fitness for office, at times appending his agreement. \u201cDon\u2019t assume that the things he says and does are part of a rational plan or strategy, because they seldom are,\u201d he wrote at one point, quote-tweeting Never Trumper Bill Kristol. \u201cConsider them as a product of his pathologies, and they make perfect sense.\u201d\nThis weekend\u2019s split-screen extended to other topics. Around the time George was re-tweeting criticism of Trump for failing to sufficiently address the mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, Kellyanne popped up on Fox & Friends to take the opposite stance. \u201cI guess everybody scoured it and searched for Donald Trump\u2019s name,\u201d she said of the shooter\u2019s manifesto, which mentioned the president as a source of inspiration. She went on to argue that the gunman was more of an \u201ceco-naturalist or an eco-fascist\u201d than a white nationalist, and that \u201cpeople should read the [manifesto] in its entirety\u201d for proof that Trump is blameless.\nThe definitive piece on the Conway marriage, published in The Washington Post in August 2018, depicted their divided household as one in which they frequently butt heads over Kellyanne\u2019s position as Trump\u2019s chief defender. Their marriage survives, the article posits, by the grace of a 15,000-square-foot house, where each can get some distance from the other. One of the most-cited exchanges came when writer Ben Terris pressed Kellyanne on whether she found George\u2019s tweets \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and she tried (and failed) to play the \u201coff the record\u201d card:\nKellyanne: It is disrespectful, it\u2019s a violation of basic decency, certainly, if not marital vows . . . as \u201ca person familiar with their relationship.\u201d Me: No, we\u2019re on the record here. You can\u2019t say after the fact \u201cas someone familiar.\u201d Kellyanne: Fine. I\u2019ve never actually said what I think about it and I won\u2019t say what I think about it, which tells you what I think about it.\nSince then, in the words of George himself, things have only gotten worse.\n\u2014 What does \u201celite university\u201d even mean?

Trump\u2019s Middle Class Tax Cuts\u201d that the T.C.J.A. has resulted in \u201cbig bonuses.\u201d And by big, they mean, on average, a penny.\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute\u2019s Larry Mishel, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Employer Costs for Employee Compensation shows that \u201cbonuses actually fell $0.22 between December 2017 and December 2018 and the average bonus for 2018 was just $0.01 higher than in 2017.\u201d While a number of companies made ring-kissing announcements after the bill was signed into law claiming it had allowed them to dispense modest one-time bonuses, a number of these had reportedly been in the works long before the legislation was passed. What\u2019s more, as Mishel notes, the trend toward giving out bonuses rather than raises \u201cstarted taking off four years ago,\u201d and hasn\u2019t exactly been great for employees, considering they\u2019re not permanent.\nWhile the White House continues to insist to this day that bonuses\u2014big ones!\u2014were handed out at companies across America all thanks to the T.C.J.A (n\u00e9e the Cut Cut Cut Act), it has backed away from putting an exact number on the rewards now that the actual data is out. When the administration was selling the plan, it claimed the average American family would wake up to an extra $4,000 in its pocket, and maybe even up to $9,000. Those figures were provided by Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, whose chairman, leading light Kevin Hassett, argued during the shutdown that furloughed workers should consider the (unpaid) time off a free vacation.\nAnyway, enjoy that penny\u2014don\u2019t spend it all in one place!\nIf you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click here to subscribe.\nLifting sanctions on a Russian oligarch\u2019s metals company worked out pretty well for Mitch McConnell\nRusal, the aluminum company partially owned by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, announced plans to invest around $200 million to build a new aluminum plant in Kentucky just months after the Trump administration removed it from the U.S. sanctions list. The new aluminum plant, slated to be built in the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, will be the biggest new aluminum plant constructed in the U.S. in decades. Rusal will have a 40 percent stake in the facility.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH How a Celebrity Trainer Gets Actors in Shape for Movies Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5c17f4642795515e79000027.js?iu=/3379/vanityfair.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://www.vanityfair.com/video/watch/how-a-celebrity-trainer-gets-actors-in-shape-for-movies/\nOur bad!
