At the end of World War II, he was shot by a <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/mussolinis-final-hours-70-years-ago\">firing squad</a> for his crimes. His body was publicly hung upside down.</p>\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/about/directory/gunderman-richard.html\">political philosophy course</a> at Indiana University, my students and I study Mussolini&rsquo;s rise to power and his dishonorable end. His life offers deep, cautionary insights for contemporary politics.</p>\n<h2>The early years</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://biographics.org/benito-mussolini-biography-italian-dictator-and-journalist-who-was-the-leader-of-the-national-fascist-party/\">Mussolini</a> was born in the small Italian town of Predappio in 1883. After qualifying as a teacher, he joined the socialists, who believed in public ownership of property.</p>\n<p>He was arrested and jailed by the government for promoting strikes. His advocacy in support of World War I brought him into conflict with the socialist party, which expelled him. In response, he founded a new political movement, <a href=\"http://www.auburn.edu/%7Ejohnspm/gloss/fascism\">Fascism</a>, from the Italian word for &ldquo;bundle,&rdquo; which symbolized government authority in ancient Rome.</p>\n<p>Wounded while serving in the Italian military, he was discharged and began working as a journalist. Thereafter, Mussolini received funding from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/13/benito-mussolini-recruited-mi5-italy\">British secret service</a> to publish pro-war propaganda in his newspaper. He developed the idea of &ldquo;vital space,&rdquo; calling on Italy to reclaim from other Mediterranean nations much of the land that once belonged to the Roman Empire. In 1919, he announced that the fascist movement was becoming a political party.</p>\n<h2>The fascists</h2>\n<p>As the leader of fascism, Mussolini pushed for the growth of the Italian population. He believed a larger population was necessary for the nation to function as a world-class military power. He also regarded <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/contemporary-european-history/article/mussolinis-follies-fascism-in-its-imperial-and-racist-phase-19351940/B385EFFE31E9B62F76BF40886F1388AB\">Africans and Asians</a> as inherently inferior. Again and again, he called on white Italian women to produce more children.</p>\n<p>Mussolini&rsquo;s fascists formed squads of war veterans known as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/italy-1900-to-1939/life-in-fascist-italy/\">Black Shirts</a>,&rdquo; who would clash with the members of other political parties, particularly communists and socialists. The government harbored deep fears of a communist revolution and rarely interfered, giving Mussolini&rsquo;s forces relatively free rein.</p>\n<p>In 1922, <a href=\"https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/italy-1900-to-1939/the-march-on-rome/\">tens of thousands of Black Shirts</a> gathered in Rome to demand political change. The liberal government sought to declare martial law, but the king of Italy, <a href=\"https://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Victor_Emmanuel_III\">Victor Emmanuel III</a>, fearing civil war, instead asked Mussolini to form a new government.</p>\n<p>While the Fascists constituted only a small percentage of Prime Minister Mussolini&rsquo;s original government, he pressured the legislature to grant him dictatorial powers over what citizens could do and not do, seeking to meld the state with the Fascist party.</p>\n<p>By 1924, his national alliance won nearly two-thirds of the vote. A <a href=\"https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/italy-1900-to-1939/the-murder-of-matteotti/\">socialist deputy</a> who decried ballot irregularities was murdered.</p>\n<h2>Life under fascism</h2>\n<p>Mussolini quickly built a cult of personality around himself. Those who sought to oppose him were held in check by governmental and extra-governmental means, including intimidation. Multiple <a href=\"https://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1241&context=jvbl\">assassination attempts</a> against him were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>Mussolini selected the editors of news outlets, required all teachers to take an oath of allegiance to the Fascist regime, and invested large sums of money in projects designed to enhance his own standing <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40257305?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">domestically and around the world</a>. In &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm\">The Doctrine of Fascism</a>,&rdquo; published in 1932, Mussolini and a fellow Fascist described the state as &ldquo;all embracing,&rdquo; declaring that outside of it &ldquo;no human or spiritual values can exist.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Fascism&rsquo;s fall</h2>\n<p>As seeds of World War II began to germinate in the 1930s, Mussolini believed that Britain and France were doomed by low birth rates and the relatively high age of their populations, and he determined that Italy should ally itself with rapidly growing Germany.</p>\n<p>When the Germans under Hitler easily invaded Poland in 1939, Mussolini <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/axis-alliance-in-world-war-ii\">concluded</a> that Germany would quickly prevail and entered the war on its side.</p>\n<p>Yet Italy was a much weaker war power than Germany, and by 1943, a series of defeats had left the Italian army in desperate shape. Italy&rsquo;s factories were idled, and food shortages were the rule. The people <a href=\"https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/em-18-what-is-the-future-of-italy-(1945)/the-rise-and-fall-of-fascism\">turned against</a> &ldquo;Il Duce.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/263196/original/file-20190311-86710-de4dex.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/263196/original/file-20190311-86710-de4dex.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Allied soldiers walk through the entrance to a fascist youth camp and school in 1943. The gate is designed as a giant letter &lsquo;M,&rsquo; in reference to Italy&rsquo;s dictator Mussolini.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Soon U.S. and Allied forces were bombing Rome. When Allied troops swept into Italy in 1945, Mussolini was apprehended by communists and <a href=\"https://www.theweek.co.uk/93151/how-did-italy-s-fascist-dictator-benito-mussolini-die\">executed</a>.</p>\n<h2>Lessons of fascism</h2>\n<p>As outlined by historian <a href=\"https://www.martingilbert.com/\">Martin Gilbert</a>, the Italian and German experiments with fascism <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23005773?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents\">offer urgent lessons</a> for our own day.</p>\n<p>First, the strongest protection against one-man rule is deep and widespread respect for democracy. Mussolini undermined free speech and freedom of the press. He weakened the legislative and judicial branches of government. He tried to control what people saw, heard and read.</p>\n<p>A second lesson from fascism is to prevent the manufacture of emergencies. By creating a widespread sense that times were desperate, Mussolini, like Hitler, was able to suppress democratic institutions and tyrannize the population.</p>\n<p>Another lesson is the danger of <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-history-of-twentiethcentury-political-thought/fascism-and-racism/CFB19146B5E63D20089DF0AAC5CD84D9\">racism</a>. In arguing that whites are superior to Africans and Asians, Mussolini laid the groundwork for exploitation, oppression and even extermination.</p>\n<p>Ironically, it is quite possible that had Italy&rsquo;s military and economy prospered during the 1940s, Mussolini would not have fallen.</p>\n<h2>Fragility of freedom</h2>\n<p>People all over the world need to remember that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. Fascism and the hatred it breeds can undermine goodness and inflame evil. Democratic convictions that required centuries to build up can be demolished within months.</p>\n<p>This cautionary tale of Mussolini&rsquo;s rise to power serves as an enduring reminder of the fragility of freedom.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/richard-gunderman-103804\">Richard Gunderman</a>, Chancellor's Professor of Medicine, Liberal Arts, and Philanthropy, <em><a href=\"http://theconversation.com/institutions/indiana-university-1368\">Indiana University</a></em></p>\n<p>This article is republished from <a href=\"http://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

                "text": "One hundred years ago, in March 1919, Benito Mussolini created the fascist party in Italy.\nFor more than two decades, when he came to be known as \u201cIl Duce,\u201d or \u201cthe leader,\u201d Mussolini wielded broad powers. At the end of World War II, he was shot by a firing squad for his crimes. His body was publicly hung upside down.\nIn my political philosophy course at Indiana University, my students and I study Mussolini\u2019s rise to power and his dishonorable end. His life offers deep, cautionary insights for contemporary politics.\nThe early years\nMussolini was born in the small Italian town of Predappio in 1883. After qualifying as a teacher, he joined the socialists, who believed in public ownership of property.\nHe was arrested and jailed by the government for promoting strikes. His advocacy in support of World War I brought him into conflict with the socialist party, which expelled him. In response, he founded a new political movement, Fascism, from the Italian word for \u201cbundle,\u201d which symbolized government authority in ancient Rome.\nWounded while serving in the Italian military, he was discharged and began working as a journalist. Thereafter, Mussolini received funding from the British secret service to publish pro-war propaganda in his newspaper. He developed the idea of \u201cvital space,\u201d calling on Italy to reclaim from other Mediterranean nations much of the land that once belonged to the Roman Empire. In 1919, he announced that the fascist movement was becoming a political party.\nThe fascists\nAs the leader of fascism, Mussolini pushed for the growth of the Italian population. He believed a larger population was necessary for the nation to function as a world-class military power. He also regarded Africans and Asians as inherently inferior. Again and again, he called on white Italian women to produce more children.\nMussolini\u2019s fascists formed squads of war veterans known as \u201cBlack Shirts,\u201d who would clash with the members of other political parties, particularly communists and socialists. The government harbored deep fears of a communist revolution and rarely interfered, giving Mussolini\u2019s forces relatively free rein.\nIn 1922, tens of thousands of Black Shirts gathered in Rome to demand political change. The liberal government sought to declare martial law, but the king of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III, fearing civil war, instead asked Mussolini to form a new government.\nWhile the Fascists constituted only a small percentage of Prime Minister Mussolini\u2019s original government, he pressured the legislature to grant him dictatorial powers over what citizens could do and not do, seeking to meld the state with the Fascist party.\nBy 1924, his national alliance won nearly two-thirds of the vote. A socialist deputy who decried ballot irregularities was murdered.\nLife under fascism\nMussolini quickly built a cult of personality around himself. Those who sought to oppose him were held in check by governmental and extra-governmental means, including intimidation. Multiple assassination attempts against him were unsuccessful.\nMussolini selected the editors of news outlets, required all teachers to take an oath of allegiance to the Fascist regime, and invested large sums of money in projects designed to enhance his own standing domestically and around the world. In \u201cThe Doctrine of Fascism,\u201d published in 1932, Mussolini and a fellow Fascist described the state as \u201call embracing,\u201d declaring that outside of it \u201cno human or spiritual values can exist.\u201d\nFascism\u2019s fall\nAs seeds of World War II began to germinate in the 1930s, Mussolini believed that Britain and France were doomed by low birth rates and the relatively high age of their populations, and he determined that Italy should ally itself with rapidly growing Germany.\nWhen the Germans under Hitler easily invaded Poland in 1939, Mussolini concluded that Germany would quickly prevail and entered the war on its side.\nYet Italy was a much weaker war power than Germany, and by 1943, a series of defeats had left the Italian army in desperate shape. Italy\u2019s factories were idled, and food shortages were the rule. The people turned against \u201cIl Duce.\u201d\nSoon U.S. and Allied forces were bombing Rome. When Allied troops swept into Italy in 1945, Mussolini was apprehended by communists and executed.\nLessons of fascism\nAs outlined by historian Martin Gilbert, the Italian and German experiments with fascism offer urgent lessons for our own day.\nFirst, the strongest protection against one-man rule is deep and widespread respect for democracy. Mussolini undermined free speech and freedom of the press. He weakened the legislative and judicial branches of government. He tried to control what people saw, heard and read.\nA second lesson from fascism is to prevent the manufacture of emergencies. By creating a widespread sense that times were desperate, Mussolini, like Hitler, was able to suppress democratic institutions and tyrannize the population.\nAnother lesson is the danger of racism. In arguing that whites are superior to Africans and Asians, Mussolini laid the groundwork for exploitation, oppression and even extermination.\nIronically, it is quite possible that had Italy\u2019s military and economy prospered during the 1940s, Mussolini would not have fallen.\nFragility of freedom\nPeople all over the world need to remember that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. Fascism and the hatred it breeds can undermine goodness and inflame evil. Democratic convictions that required centuries to build up can be demolished within months.\nThis cautionary tale of Mussolini\u2019s rise to power serves as an enduring reminder of the fragility of freedom.\nRichard Gunderman, Chancellor's Professor of Medicine, Liberal Arts, and Philanthropy, Indiana University\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

He put those who refuse to call Trump what he is &mdash; a racist and antiSemite &mdash; on blast. Stop using soft language around it. Who benefits from it? Only the racists. Only the antiSemites. This righteous tirade came after Chris Hayes asked the NYT journalist about, in particular, what he made of the silence of Trump in the face of the awful New Zealand terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 50 innocent Muslims at prayer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>ALI: It's the feature, not the bug. Let's not forget when it came to Charlottesville, and there were white supremacists, KKK and the alt-right, who repeated the white supremacist conspiracy theory that &quot;Jews will not replace us,&quot; Donald Trump responded by saying there are very fine people, and both sides are to blame. And when it's come to this terrorist attack in New Zealand, which has claimed fifty lives, including a three-year-old baby, it's been five days, Chris, and Donald Trump has yet to use the &quot;t&quot; word, terrorism, to describe it. In fact, he has yet to reach out the the victims. In fact, I wish he had half as much concern for the rest of Americans, including Muslims, that he does defending Judge Pirro, who promoted anti-Muslim conspiracies that are found in the same ideological swamp shared by these white supremacists around the world. I wish he would attack the number one domestic terror threat in America, according to the FBI, which are white supremacists, the number one source of domestic terror plots in the past ten years, with as much gusto and passion that he attacked John McCain, the press, SNL and Robert Mueller. But he has not done that and he hasn't done it throughout his presidency. And, I'll say something bold here, it's because I think, Chris, <strong>Donald Trump is racist.</strong> He's not racially charged or racially motivated or has racial flare-ups. He has promoted and mainstreamed a white supremacist conspiracy theory to win the midterm elections, which is that George Soros was funding the caravan &mdash; the invasion. The same language used, by the way, by the Australian terrorists who killed 50 people last week.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Um...YES, PLEASE...</p>\n<p>Hayes brought up the Mick Mulvaney apology tour, you know the one where the Acting Chief of Staff went to all the cable news shows and had to answer the question, &quot;Hey, is your boss a white supremacist? He sure seems awful white supremacist-y.&quot; (Sidenote - I don't think Mulvaney has what it takes. By the third or so, he was suuuper tired of answering that question...&quot;How many times do I have to deny this???&quot;) Ali had an epic takedown of that insulting display, as well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>ALI: It's 2019. You can't gaslight me. Because I remember the president saying, &quot;I think Islam hates us.&quot; I remember the president asking for a (*slipping into the Trump voice*) &quot;total and complete ban on Muslims until we can figure out what the hell is going on.&quot; I remember the president saying he saw a tape on television of Muslims celebrating the 9/11 terror attacks. I double-dare you, President Trump. I'm calling you out. You say that you saw the tape of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey the 9/11 terror attacks. Show me the tape. So this is a president who's anti-Muslim. Again I want to say this, Chris. He mainstreamed a white supremacist talking point in October. The Jews, led by George Soros, a Jewish-Hungarian American, funding the caravan of rapists, criminals, Muslims and Mexicans. That is exactly the number one conspiracy theory of white supremacists, that the rest of us are being used by the Jews to weaken the white race, which was used by the shooter who killed 50 people last week. You got to call him out and you've also got to call out the Republican leaders who also mainstreamed it. That includes Kevin McCarthy. Call them all out, and ask them, &quot;Do you stand by President Trump's views of that white supremacist conspiracy theory?&quot; Reporters need to ask until they answer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You hear that, reporters? Call racism and antiSemitism what it is, when it happens, even if it comes out of the mouths of powerful people. ESPECIALLY when it comes out of the mouths of our leaders. And don't stop asking about it until they answer.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/1add99ac-09e2-46fa-a2b7-c6130a74a361/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=720&height=405\"></img></figure>",

                "text": "Wajahat Ali called for \u2014 dare I say it? \u2014 accuracy in reporting on Trump's bigotry, and it was a beautiful thing. He put those who refuse to call Trump what he is \u2014 a racist and antiSemite \u2014 on blast. Stop using soft language around it. Who benefits from it? Only the racists. Only the antiSemites. This righteous tirade came after Chris Hayes asked the NYT journalist about, in particular, what he made of the silence of Trump in the face of the awful New Zealand terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 50 innocent Muslims at prayer.\nALI: It's the feature, not the bug. Let's not forget when it came to Charlottesville, and there were white supremacists, KKK and the alt-right, who repeated the white supremacist conspiracy theory that \"Jews will not replace us,\" Donald Trump responded by saying there are very fine people, and both sides are to blame. And when it's come to this terrorist attack in New Zealand, which has claimed fifty lives, including a three-year-old baby, it's been five days, Chris, and Donald Trump has yet to use the \"t\" word, terrorism, to describe it. In fact, he has yet to reach out the the victims. In fact, I wish he had half as much concern for the rest of Americans, including Muslims, that he does defending Judge Pirro, who promoted anti-Muslim conspiracies that are found in the same ideological swamp shared by these white supremacists around the world. I wish he would attack the number one domestic terror threat in America, according to the FBI, which are white supremacists, the number one source of domestic terror plots in the past ten years, with as much gusto and passion that he attacked John McCain, the press, SNL and Robert Mueller. But he has not done that and he hasn't done it throughout his presidency. And, I'll say something bold here, it's because I think, Chris, Donald Trump is racist. He's not racially charged or racially motivated or has racial flare-ups. He has promoted and mainstreamed a white supremacist conspiracy theory to win the midterm elections, which is that George Soros was funding the caravan \u2014 the invasion. The same language used, by the way, by the Australian terrorists who killed 50 people last week.\nUm...YES, PLEASE...\nHayes brought up the Mick Mulvaney apology tour, you know the one where the Acting Chief of Staff went to all the cable news shows and had to answer the question, \"Hey, is your boss a white supremacist? He sure seems awful white supremacist-y.\" (Sidenote - I don't think Mulvaney has what it takes. By the third or so, he was suuuper tired of answering that question...\"How many times do I have to deny this???\") Ali had an epic takedown of that insulting display, as well.\nALI: It's 2019. You can't gaslight me. Because I remember the president saying, \"I think Islam hates us.\" I remember the president asking for a (*slipping into the Trump voice*) \"total and complete ban on Muslims until we can figure out what the hell is going on.\" I remember the president saying he saw a tape on television of Muslims celebrating the 9/11 terror attacks. I double-dare you, President Trump. I'm calling you out. You say that you saw the tape of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey the 9/11 terror attacks. Show me the tape. So this is a president who's anti-Muslim. Again I want to say this, Chris. He mainstreamed a white supremacist talking point in October. The Jews, led by George Soros, a Jewish-Hungarian American, funding the caravan of rapists, criminals, Muslims and Mexicans. That is exactly the number one conspiracy theory of white supremacists, that the rest of us are being used by the Jews to weaken the white race, which was used by the shooter who killed 50 people last week. You got to call him out and you've also got to call out the Republican leaders who also mainstreamed it. That includes Kevin McCarthy. Call them all out, and ask them, \"Do you stand by President Trump's views of that white supremacist conspiracy theory?\" Reporters need to ask until they answer.\nYou hear that, reporters? Call racism and antiSemitism what it is, when it happens, even if it comes out of the mouths of powerful people. ESPECIALLY when it comes out of the mouths of our leaders. And don't stop asking about it until they answer.",

He was serious, smart, and absolutely lethal in his questioning during Senate Judiciary hearings. His priorities were and are progressive, and his approach was unique. Refreshing. Welcome. To almost everyone.</p>\n<p>It sounds like at least <a href=\"http://time.com/5042931/al-franken-accusers/\">six or seven women</a> who came forward with stories of their experiences of his groping or kissing them without their permission didn't welcome his approach. From <em>Vox:</em></p>\n<blockquote><p>They described specific, detailed incidents in which he put his hands on their behinds or breasts during photos. Others recalled him trying to forcibly kiss them. Franken apologized repeatedly but said he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he&rsquo;d done the things he was sorry might have happened. &ldquo;I take thousands and thousands of pictures, sometimes in chaotic and crowded situations,&rdquo; he said. <strong>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I haven&rsquo;t done that.</strong> I&rsquo;m very sorry if these women experienced that.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now, let's talk about this for a moment. This &quot;chaotic and crowded situation&quot; Franken was so often in as an entertainer and politician. Schwepps (yes, the soda company) did <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/sex-relationships/sensor-dress?rebelltitem=3#rebelltitem3\">a very interesting study</a> regarding unwanted touching and groping in crowded situations. They created a sensor-equipped dress to monitor how often a woman was touched or groped in a bar without her consent, and where on her body. Three different women wore the dress over the course of the evening.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Women around the world have long reported that men, strangers included, touch them all the time without permission, much less an invitation. Even when asked not to. It's a particularly invasive form of objectification. Isn't everyone supposed to be entitled to personal space?</p></blockquote>\n<p>The results? The women were touched or groped, without invitation or permission, a total of 157 times in just under four hours, in spite of and over the women's objections. That's nearly 40 times an hour. Once every minute-and-a-fraction. This is the sort of thing that is consistently dismissed, belittled, laughed at, and that women are told they are too sensitive if they object. Now, if you still think that is nothing to complain about, I will personally meet you at a party and touch you on your nose every 70 seconds. That's not even sexual. Let's see how you like it.</p>\n<p>Back to Al Franken, <strong>he couldn't say he hadn't done it.</strong> He was sorry &quot;if&quot; these women experienced his groping and uninvited kissing. Including an<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/30/politics/al-franken-groping-allegation/index.html\"> Army Veteran in 2003</a>, by the way, who had lined up to take a photo with Franken during his USO tour. When he put his arm around her, she claims he cupped her right breast for around 10 seconds, only stopping because she had to change positions for the photo.</p>\n<p>As these allegations came to light, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and 30 of their colleagues called for his resignation. He acquiesced, despite the fact he could have very easily remained for the ethics investigation to finish. Many lament this end to Franken's Senate career, and possibly his 2020 presidential bid, should he have had those aspirations.</p>\n<p>Ironically, many have also determined it will end Gillibrand's 2020 presidential bid, since they continue to hold incredible anger and resentment towards <em>HER</em> for having pressed the matter, and being willing to lead the call for his resignation.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Gillibrand is continuing to be challenged on the campaign trail about this matter, and if social media comments are any indication, the challenges are accompanied by tremendous hostility and resentment. This despite the fact that Franken has not responded to several of the allegations of groping, and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/07/al-franken-resignation-speech-transcript-full-text-285960\">in his resignation speech</a>, he said he denied some of them, and remembered other of the women's claims &quot;very differently.&quot;</p>\n<p>For some, Gillibrand is somehow the villain, not Franken.</p>\n<p>Here's her accounting of the situation and the reasoning that led to the decisions she made.</p>\n<blockquote><p> In terms of Senator Franken, this is a very hard issue for so many Democrats, because <strong>the truth is we miss him and people love him.</strong> But he had eight credible allegations against him of sexual harassment for groping. Two of them, since he was a senator, and the eighth one that came out was a Congressional staffer. And I had a choice to make, whether to stay silent or not, whether to say it's not okay with me, and I decided to say that. Now, Senator Franken was entitled to whatever type of review or process he wanted. He could have stuck it out, stayed in the Senate, gone through his Ethics Committee investigation for as long as he wants. He could have sued all of the eight women who came out against him. Those were his choices, but I had to make my choice. I am a mother of boys. the conversations I was having at home at the time were very upsetting. Theo said, &quot;Why are you so tough on Al Franken?&quot; As a mother, I had to be clear. &quot;It's not okay for anyone to grope a woman anywhere on her body without her consent. It is not okay to forcibly kiss a woman &mdash; ever &mdash; without her consent. it was not okay for Senator Franken. And it is not okay for you, Theo, ever.&quot; So I needed to have clarity. If there are few Democratic powerful donors who are angry because I stood up for women who came forward with allegations of sexual harassment, that's on them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I'd like to harken back to Franken's final Senate speech again...where he asks those who love him not to worry:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This has been a tough few weeks for me. But I am a very, very lucky man. I have a beautiful, healthy family that I love, and that loves me very much. I am going to be just fine.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Boy, isn't that the truth. Over one year later, and people are still crying over having lost him in the Senate, despite the tremendous strides women have made politically in the last year and a half. Despite the fact that we have five, count them, <em>FIVE</em> women running for the Democratic 2020 nomination. Despite the fact that we have since he resigned, still managed to take the House and run Trump into the ground with the investigations thanks to some of those Democratically-led committees. Of what, exactly, has Senator Gillibrand deprived us, other than shaky moral ground?</p>\n<p>Al Franken was right. He is going to be just fine.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that misogynistic terms and commentary are not tolerated in the comments section. B, C, D-words will mean those comments are deleted. Don't be that guy. -- eds.</em></p>",

Even when asked not to. It's a particularly invasive form of objectification. Isn't everyone supposed to be entitled to personal space?\nThe results? The women were touched or groped, without invitation or permission, a total of 157 times in just under four hours, in spite of and over the women's objections. That's nearly 40 times an hour. Once every minute-and-a-fraction. This is the sort of thing that is consistently dismissed, belittled, laughed at, and that women are told they are too sensitive if they object. Now, if you still think that is nothing to complain about, I will personally meet you at a party and touch you on your nose every 70 seconds. That's not even sexual. Let's see how you like it.\nBack to Al Franken, he couldn't say he hadn't done it. He was sorry \"if\" these women experienced his groping and uninvited kissing. Including an Army Veteran in 2003, by the way, who had lined up to take a photo with Franken during his USO tour. When he put his arm around her, she claims he cupped her right breast for around 10 seconds, only stopping because she had to change positions for the photo.\nAs these allegations came to light, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and 30 of their colleagues called for his resignation. He acquiesced, despite the fact he could have very easily remained for the ethics investigation to finish. Many lament this end to Franken's Senate career, and possibly his 2020 presidential bid, should he have had those aspirations.\nIronically, many have also determined it will end Gillibrand's 2020 presidential bid, since they continue to hold incredible anger and resentment towards HER for having pressed the matter, and being willing to lead the call for his resignation.\nIndeed, Gillibrand is continuing to be challenged on the campaign trail about this matter, and if social media comments are any indication, the challenges are accompanied by tremendous hostility and resentment. This despite the fact that Franken has not responded to several of the allegations of groping, and in his resignation speech, he said he denied some of them, and remembered other of the women's claims \"very differently.\"\nFor some, Gillibrand is somehow the villain, not Franken.\nHere's her accounting of the situation and the reasoning that led to the decisions she made.\nIn terms of Senator Franken, this is a very hard issue for so many Democrats, because the truth is we miss him and people love him. But he had eight credible allegations against him of sexual harassment for groping. Two of them, since he was a senator, and the eighth one that came out was a Congressional staffer. And I had a choice to make, whether to stay silent or not, whether to say it's not okay with me, and I decided to say that. Now, Senator Franken was entitled to whatever type of review or process he wanted. He could have stuck it out, stayed in the Senate, gone through his Ethics Committee investigation for as long as he wants. He could have sued all of the eight women who came out against him. Those were his choices, but I had to make my choice. I am a mother of boys. the conversations I was having at home at the time were very upsetting. Theo said, \"Why are you so tough on Al Franken?\" As a mother, I had to be clear. \"It's not okay for anyone to grope a woman anywhere on her body without her consent. It is not okay to forcibly kiss a woman \u2014 ever \u2014 without her consent. it was not okay for Senator Franken. And it is not okay for you, Theo, ever.\" So I needed to have clarity. If there are few Democratic powerful donors who are angry because I stood up for women who came forward with allegations of sexual harassment, that's on them.\nI'd like to harken back to Franken's final Senate speech again...where he asks those who love him not to worry:\nThis has been a tough few weeks for me. But I am a very, very lucky man. I have a beautiful, healthy family that I love, and that loves me very much. I am going to be just fine.\nBoy, isn't that the truth. Over one year later, and people are still crying over having lost him in the Senate, despite the tremendous strides women have made politically in the last year and a half. Despite the fact that we have five, count them, FIVE women running for the Democratic 2020 nomination. Despite the fact that we have since he resigned, still managed to take the House and run Trump into the ground with the investigations thanks to some of those Democratically-led committees. Of what, exactly, has Senator Gillibrand deprived us, other than shaky moral ground?\nAl Franken was right. He is going to be just fine.\nPlease note that misogynistic terms and commentary are not tolerated in the comments section. B, C, D-words will mean those comments are deleted. Don't be that guy. -- eds.",

                "text": "On Tuesday evening a bill requiring all presidential and vice presidential candidates to disclose the last 5 years of their tax returns in order to appear on Washington state ballots passed the Senate floor. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Patty Kuderer (D-Bellevue), passed 28 to 21 along party lines, because of course it did.\nIf Gov. Inslee ends up signing this bill, Donald Trump, Mike Pence, and Joe Bernie Sanders Warren Harris would have to show us the money if they want to get a vote from a single Washingtonian.\nTwenty-six other states have introduced similar legislation, but so far none have taken. Two years ago, California\u2019s Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed a similar bill that passed through both chambers there.\u201d\nThis is pretty cool!\nAnd of course Gov. Inslee will sign it: he\u2019s always shown his returns, and as a contender in the 2020 Goat Rodeo this shows he means bidness about transparency.\nThat said I\u2019m not sure for the 2020 Goat Rodeo it will matter that much. Comrade Stupid is unlikely to win Washington and might decide to skip being on the ballot altogether, while the Democrats have pretty much always released their tax returns. It will undoubtedly be challenged in court, which should make the State Rights Conservatives squirm, but as election laws are left to the states I see little chance this could wind up before The Virgin Mayor of Keg City Brett Kavanaugh to decide.\nCome\u2019on, 26 other states, let\u2019s get on it!",

A second bill would outlaw abortion after 20 weeks.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;God is moving in strange and wonderful ways, folks,&rdquo; the lawmaker insisted. &ldquo;Gun bills that we&rsquo;ve talked about will save essentially no lives because it will have no impact on criminals getting of keeping their guns. But every single year, we kill hundreds of people in abortions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You know, we have a massive problem in this country,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Our birthrate is way, way below replacement [levels].

                "text": "Delaware state Rep. Richard Collins (R) said this week that he was sponsoring an anti-abortion bill because women are not replenishing the U.S. population quickly enough.\nWhile speaking to WGMD-FM on Tuesday, Collins explained that he was introducing a bill that would require women to listen to the fetal heartbeat before having an abortion. A second bill would outlaw abortion after 20 weeks.\n\u201cGod is moving in strange and wonderful ways, folks,\u201d the lawmaker insisted. \u201cGun bills that we\u2019ve talked about will save essentially no lives because it will have no impact on criminals getting of keeping their guns. But every single year, we kill hundreds of people in abortions.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, we have a massive problem in this country,\u201d he continued. \u201cOur birthrate is way, way below replacement [levels]. You know, we are just not having enough babies.\u201d\nAccording to Collins, women are \u201cdoing away\u201d with their fetuses \u201cbefore they have a chance to grow into these people that we need to support us.\u201d\n\u201cThese bills are very, very minor,\u201d Collins said dismissively. \u201cAll that we\u2019re adding is, let them see the baby moving within them and let them hear the heartbeat\u2026 Just add the ability to see it move \u2014 live action \u2014 and they say about 75% of the women will not do the abortion.\u201d\nIn the video below, Collins explains why he\u2019s passionate about the Bible.\nWinter Donation Drive\nFor 16 years we have been exposing Washington lies and untangling media deceit.

For Stuart Varney, &quot;fair&quot; apparently means keeping all the money one earns in a country where the government socializes loss while privatizing profit.</p>\n<p>Varney could hardly wait to launch his rant on <em>Fox and Friends</em> Tuesday morning. He was primed for bear, or in this case, Bernie Sanders, who told Martha McCallum the night before that he supported a 52 percent income tax rate on the rich and an estate tax of far more.</p>\n<p>&quot;Here is a guy who is -- he's a 1 percenter. He's a millionaire. And he's a socialist,&quot; Varney seethed. &quot;I got a problem with that.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;He is trying to make sure that we, the rest of us on our way up, don't accumulate the kind of pile that he has already got at 77,&quot; he went on, as if he isn't a millionaire in his own right.</p>\n<p>Warming up, he howled his discontent for all to see. &quot;It is outrageous. He wants to raise the estate tax dramatically to take it off you. Now look, where is the fairness in this? Where is the fairness in taking more, wait, wait, wait. Bernie Sanders constantly goes back to the idea he has a fair plan. He is for fairness in our society. <strong>Where is the fairness in taking more than half of anyone's income?</strong> Where is it?&quot; he wailed.</p>\n<p>I guess this is where I have to remind Stuart Varney and others of a couple of things. First, there's no fairness in Walmart workers having to go on food stamps to supplement their full time paychecks either. There's no fairness in a tax bill that gives corporations and billionaires a pass while middle class workers are hit with a tax bill that's twice what they paid last year. And for those folks fortunate enough to make enough money to find themselves in Bernie's top bracket, they're still keeping 48 percent of hundreds of thousands of dollars, in some cases millions.</p>\n<p>Varney couldn't stop crying, though. After ranting about income tax, he moved on to Sanders' proposed estate tax, whining, &quot;Where is the fairness in confiscating our money when we've saved all our lives for that money to pass on to our children and our grandchildren? Where is the fairness in confiscating that?&quot;</p>\n<p>I don't know about you, but most folks I know are scraping along and either can't save any money for an emergency, or have very little saved. They have no retirement savings, and certainly aren't thinking about what they're passing down to their children and grandchildren. We're more concerned that there won't be a planet for them than with any inheritance they get from us. So why should we give some special deference to the Kochs of the world, again?</p>\n<p>For an extra giggle, watch Brian Kilmeade stretch out the word &quot;SOCIALISM&quot; as if it is a swear word that will cause viewers to recoil. It seems to me they're hip to the fact that Medicare is a socialist program already and support some more of that!</p>\n<p>As for Varney, I'm sure we'll hear him whine more and more about how MEAN it is for Democrats to want wealthy folks to pay their fair share.</p>\n<p>(Transcript via <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2019/04/16/Following-Bernie-Sanders-Fox-News-town-hall-Foxs-Stuart-Varney-rails-against-Sanders-tax-p/223457\">Media Matters</a>)</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/1add99ac-09e2-46fa-a2b7-c6130a74a361/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=720&height=405\"></img></figure>",

                "text": "Oh dear, someone over at Fox News thinks life is supposed to be fair. For Stuart Varney, \"fair\" apparently means keeping all the money one earns in a country where the government socializes loss while privatizing profit.\nVarney could hardly wait to launch his rant on Fox and Friends Tuesday morning. He was primed for bear, or in this case, Bernie Sanders, who told Martha McCallum the night before that he supported a 52 percent income tax rate on the rich and an estate tax of far more.\n\"Here is a guy who is -- he's a 1 percenter. He's a millionaire. And he's a socialist,\" Varney seethed. \"I got a problem with that.\"\n\"He is trying to make sure that we, the rest of us on our way up, don't accumulate the kind of pile that he has already got at 77,\" he went on, as if he isn't a millionaire in his own right.\nWarming up, he howled his discontent for all to see. \"It is outrageous. He wants to raise the estate tax dramatically to take it off you. Now look, where is the fairness in this? Where is the fairness in taking more, wait, wait, wait. Bernie Sanders constantly goes back to the idea he has a fair plan. He is for fairness in our society. Where is the fairness in taking more than half of anyone's income? Where is it?\" he wailed.\nI guess this is where I have to remind Stuart Varney and others of a couple of things. First, there's no fairness in Walmart workers having to go on food stamps to supplement their full time paychecks either. There's no fairness in a tax bill that gives corporations and billionaires a pass while middle class workers are hit with a tax bill that's twice what they paid last year. And for those folks fortunate enough to make enough money to find themselves in Bernie's top bracket, they're still keeping 48 percent of hundreds of thousands of dollars, in some cases millions.\nVarney couldn't stop crying, though. After ranting about income tax, he moved on to Sanders' proposed estate tax, whining, \"Where is the fairness in confiscating our money when we've saved all our lives for that money to pass on to our children and our grandchildren? Where is the fairness in confiscating that?\"\nI don't know about you, but most folks I know are scraping along and either can't save any money for an emergency, or have very little saved. They have no retirement savings, and certainly aren't thinking about what they're passing down to their children and grandchildren. We're more concerned that there won't be a planet for them than with any inheritance they get from us. So why should we give some special deference to the Kochs of the world, again?\nFor an extra giggle, watch Brian Kilmeade stretch out the word \"SOCIALISM\" as if it is a swear word that will cause viewers to recoil. It seems to me they're hip to the fact that Medicare is a socialist program already and support some more of that!\nAs for Varney, I'm sure we'll hear him whine more and more about how MEAN it is for Democrats to want wealthy folks to pay their fair share.\n(Transcript via Media Matters)",

We get to the heart of the reason many people don't want to see the Mueller report out, because their names are all over it,&quot; Geist said. &quot;Who are we talking about?&quot;</p>\n<p>She said officials were told to cooperate with the Mueller investigation.</p>\n<p>&quot;Look, we were told the only thing to do is go in and tell the truth or otherwise risk perjury charges. Now it's coming out and is my name going to be in there, or is it going to be like a Bob Woodward book kind of thing where you can kind of figure out exactly who said what and what the different sources are? And then basically they're all just worried about the president's wrath, that he and his allies are going to come down on them and whether it's through Twitter or Fox News, criticize them. There's a lot of anxiety,&quot; she said.</p>\n<p>&quot;That's why they're worried -- that they won't be redacted?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes. A couple of people said there's not so much things that we can't imagine what the president would have said or done. It's just more of the kind of things that we already know that will be new, and that will be able to be ascribed to certain people. Because in certain situations, it could be it's just the president and one other person, and then it's completely obvious who then went and told,&quot; she said.</p>\n<p>And Daddy gets very angry if you tell.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/1add99ac-09e2-46fa-a2b7-c6130a74a361/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=720&height=405\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/31a334ea-a0bf-4f47-b52b-74efd8b13478/152.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=338&width=600\"></img></figure>",

We get to the heart of the reason many people don't want to see the Mueller report out, because their names are all over it,\" Geist said. \"Who are we talking about?\"\nShe said officials were told to cooperate with the Mueller investigation.\n\"Look, we were told the only thing to do is go in and tell the truth or otherwise risk perjury charges. Now it's coming out and is my name going to be in there, or is it going to be like a Bob Woodward book kind of thing where you can kind of figure out exactly who said what and what the different sources are? And then basically they're all just worried about the president's wrath, that he and his allies are going to come down on them and whether it's through Twitter or Fox News, criticize them. There's a lot of anxiety,\" she said.\n\"That's why they're worried -- that they won't be redacted?\"\n\"Yes. A couple of people said there's not so much things that we can't imagine what the president would have said or done. It's just more of the kind of things that we already know that will be new, and that will be able to be ascribed to certain people. Because in certain situations, it could be it's just the president and one other person, and then it's completely obvious who then went and told,\" she said.\nAnd Daddy gets very angry if you tell.",

Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) warned Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Tweeting in anticipation of the redacted report&rsquo;s Thursday release, Rep. Meadows reminded Americans that Mueller and his team helped determine what would be redacted:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&ldquo;Important for this week: Democrats will predictably try to seize on redactions within the Mueller report and accuse Bill Bar of hiding something. Remember the Special Counsel and his team are directly HELPING with the redaction process. Don't buy the spin.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, on April 9, 2018, Barr testified in a House hearing that Mueller and his staff are participating in selecting redactions:</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong><u>Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.):</u></strong> &ldquo;Can you tell us who is factually accurate and will the released report include details on the obstruction issue and why, as you noted, the President is not exonerated or will that information be redacted?&rdquo;</p> <p><strong><u>AG Barr:</u></strong> &ldquo;I've already explained the information that's going to be redacted from the report, the four categories. That is what's going to govern the redactions. And, in fact, the Special Counsel and his staff are helping us select the information in the report that falls into those four categories.</p> <p>&ldquo;But, again, the report, I'll be in a position, as I said, within a week to release the report. People can then read the report. I have already promised the judiciary committees that I would appear as soon as they're able to schedule a hearing after the report is released. So I'm not going to discuss it any further until after the report is out.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/barr-expects-release-redacted-mueller-report-within-week\">As CNSNews.com reported</a> on April 9, the four types of information that will be redacted are:</p>\n<ol><li>Grand jury material,</li> <li>Classified information that would reveal sources and methods,</li> <li>Information that would interfere with ongoing prosecutions, and</li> <li>Information that intrudes on the privacy or reputation of &ldquo;peripheral players.&rdquo;</li> </ol>\n<p>On Monday, Rep. Meadows predicted Democrats will &ldquo;spin anything possible&rdquo; from the report to continue rationalizing &ldquo;a conspiracy that doesn&rsquo;t exist&rdquo;:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Thursday's Mueller report should end the collusion delusion, once and for all. But we already know Democrats will do what they've done for 2 years: spin anything possible to try and prop up a conspiracy that doesn't exist. We know the bottom line. No collusion. It's over.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>CNSNews Reader,</strong></p>\n<p>The liberal media are terrified of the truth, especially when it leads to uncomfortable questions about their own leftist worldview.</p>\n<p>CNSNews covers the stories that the liberal media are afraid to touch.

Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said a lot of things about gun laws and legislation that were just plain not true.</p>\n<p>In response to a schoolteacher&rsquo;s question about gun control, Gillibrand said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We have to take on the corporate corruption and greed that the NRA stands for. The reason why we&rsquo;ve been unable to pass any commonsense gun reform ever is because the NRA is largely funded by the gun manufacturers &hellip;</p> <p>And, unfortunately, because the gun manufacturers only care about gun sales, they oppose the commonsense reform that can save lives. They want to oppose universal background checks because they want to sell an assault rifle to a teenager in a Walmart or to someone on the terror watch list or to someone who is gravely mentally ill with a violent background or to someone with a criminal conviction for a violent crime. They want to sell those weapons; that&rsquo;s why they oppose universal background checks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a clip in the tweet below; video of the full event is available on <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?458775-1/senator-kirsten-gillibrand-manchester-hampshire\">C-SPAN</a>. The action starts at the 33:00 mark.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"> <p>Gillibrand: Because the gun manufacturers only care about gun sales&hellip;they want to oppose universal background checks because they want to sell an assault rifle to a teenager in a Walmart. Or to someone on the terror watch list or to someone who's gravely mentally ill&hellip; <a href=\"https://t.co/dsZivAiL4q\">pic.twitter.com/dsZivAiL4q</a></p> </blockquote>\n<p>Gillibrand continued:</p>\n<blockquote><p>And it&rsquo;s why they won&rsquo;t do commonsense things like have an anti-trafficking law. In a state like New York, our number one problem is that guns used in crimes get trafficked from out of state right into the hands of gang members. &hellip;</p> <p>This is the definition of corruption. It is the definition of greed. And they have a chokehold on Congress unlike anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen. And so commonsense members of Congress that you&rsquo;d think would be for these things aren&rsquo;t because they&rsquo;re so afraid of the NRA.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of ground to cover. Here are the facts:</p>\n<p>First off, the NRA <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/10/national-rifle-association-support-voters-politicians-campaign-contributions-minuscule/\">doesn&rsquo;t spend that much money at all</a> compared to other national advocacy groups. Its real strength lies in the fact that there are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/us/politics/nra-gun-control-florida.html\">a ton of people in this country who believe that the Second Amendment exists for a reason</a>. To try to simply blame widespread Second Amendment support on corporate greed and monetary influence is either lazy, misinformed, or plain dishonest.</p>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s address universal background checks. Every single retail transaction, i.e., the kinds of transactions that result directly in gun manufacturer profits, requires a federal background check. The &ldquo;universal&rdquo; background check legislation currently passed by the Democratic House would <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/news/republicans-join-dems-to-push-for-new-gun-control-law/\">only extend background check requirements to transactions between private individuals</a>. If gun makers were only looking out for their bottom line, they would support anything that makes it more difficult for people to sell used guns to other people. So her talking point makes no sense.</p>\n<p>Even crazier, she also seems to ignore the fact that <a href=\"https://www.omahaoutdoors.com/blog/gun-control-history-nra-proposed-nics/\">the NRA backed the creation of the National Instant Background Check System</a> (NICS) used every time a gun is purchased from a federal dealer.</p>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about those groups of people that the gun makers supposedly want to sell to. Felons, people with domestic violence convictions, people who have been adjudicated &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/file/58791/download\">as a mental defective</a>,&rdquo; and people who have been involuntarily committed to mental institutions are already barred from buying firearms by federal law. And it&rsquo;s illegal for anyone to sell to them, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922\">whether a dealer or a private seller</a>.</p>\n<p>As far as selling &ldquo;assault rifles&rdquo; to &ldquo;teenagers&rdquo; at retail stores, if you mean automatic weapons, you&rsquo;re not going to see those available over the counter for civilian purchase anywhere. If you want to actually own one of those, you&rsquo;d better be prepared to jump through a lot of prohibitive hoops, do some antique shopping, and shell out some big bucks. Yes, 18- and 19-year-olds can legally buy <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/news/nonsense-heres-civilian-ar-15-isnt-weapon-war/\">semi-automatic long guns with modular capabilities and aesthetics that look scary to the uninitiated</a>. Of course those are not &ldquo;assault rifles.&rdquo; But it is <a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/does-customer-have-be-certain-age-buy-firearms-or-ammunition-licensee\">illegal under federal law</a> for anyone under the age of 18 to buy a long gun from a dealer, regardless of how scary or non-scary it looks to anti-gun activists.</p>\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about that &ldquo;anti-trafficking law&rdquo; that Gillibrand mentioned. This is a talking point that doesn&rsquo;t make much sense if you&rsquo;re familiar with the laws already on the books. It&rsquo;s already illegal under federal law to purchase a gun with the intention of giving it to someone who is barred from purchasing it, and there&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.outdoorhub.com/news/2016/07/11/buying-selling-firearms-part-6-straw-purchases/\">a maximum 10-year sentence attached</a>. Furthermore, all gun transfers across state lines must go through <a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/docs/0501-firearms-top-10-qaspdf/download\">federally licensed dealers</a>who, yes, must perform background checks.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell if anti-gun politicians are outright lying to voters or if they actually believe the misleading propaganda they are eagerly spreading to support their gun control agenda. What makes it even more embarrassing for Gillibrand in this case is that she&rsquo;s trying to run from her past support of the Second Amendment and even once boasted of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/report-gillibrand-shifts-on-guns-085474\">keeping rifles under her bed</a>.</p>\n<p>Politicians who want to legislate against the Bill of Rights should at least have their facts straight first about all the laws we already <em>do</em> have to keep guns out of the hands of the incompetent or criminal.</p>\n<p><strong>Want to keep up with what&rsquo;s going on in Washington without the liberal media slant, establishment spin, and politician-ese?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up to get Blaze Media&rsquo;s Capitol Hill Brief in your inbox every morning!

                "text": "At a campaign stop late last week in New Hampshire, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said a lot of things about gun laws and legislation that were just plain not true.\nIn response to a schoolteacher\u2019s question about gun control, Gillibrand said:\nWe have to take on the corporate corruption and greed that the NRA stands for. The reason why we\u2019ve been unable to pass any commonsense gun reform ever is because the NRA is largely funded by the gun manufacturers \u2026\nAnd, unfortunately, because the gun manufacturers only care about gun sales, they oppose the commonsense reform that can save lives. They want to oppose universal background checks because they want to sell an assault rifle to a teenager in a Walmart or to someone on the terror watch list or to someone who is gravely mentally ill with a violent background or to someone with a criminal conviction for a violent crime. They want to sell those weapons; that\u2019s why they oppose universal background checks.\nHere\u2019s a clip in the tweet below; video of the full event is available on C-SPAN. The action starts at the 33:00 mark.\nGillibrand: Because the gun manufacturers only care about gun sales\u2026they want to oppose universal background checks because they want to sell an assault rifle to a teenager in a Walmart. Or to someone on the terror watch list or to someone who's gravely mentally ill\u2026 pic.twitter.com/dsZivAiL4q\nGillibrand continued:\nAnd it\u2019s why they won\u2019t do commonsense things like have an anti-trafficking law. In a state like New York, our number one problem is that guns used in crimes get trafficked from out of state right into the hands of gang members. \u2026\nThis is the definition of corruption. It is the definition of greed. And they have a chokehold on Congress unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen. And so commonsense members of Congress that you\u2019d think would be for these things aren\u2019t because they\u2019re so afraid of the NRA.\nThat\u2019s a lot of ground to cover. Here are the facts:\nFirst off, the NRA doesn\u2019t spend that much money at all compared to other national advocacy groups. Its real strength lies in the fact that there are a ton of people in this country who believe that the Second Amendment exists for a reason. To try to simply blame widespread Second Amendment support on corporate greed and monetary influence is either lazy, misinformed, or plain dishonest.\nNow let\u2019s address universal background checks. Every single retail transaction, i.e., the kinds of transactions that result directly in gun manufacturer profits, requires a federal background check. The \u201cuniversal\u201d background check legislation currently passed by the Democratic House would only extend background check requirements to transactions between private individuals. If gun makers were only looking out for their bottom line, they would support anything that makes it more difficult for people to sell used guns to other people. So her talking point makes no sense.\nEven crazier, she also seems to ignore the fact that the NRA backed the creation of the National Instant Background Check System (NICS) used every time a gun is purchased from a federal dealer.\nNow let\u2019s talk about those groups of people that the gun makers supposedly want to sell to. Felons, people with domestic violence convictions, people who have been adjudicated \u201cas a mental defective,\u201d and people who have been involuntarily committed to mental institutions are already barred from buying firearms by federal law. And it\u2019s illegal for anyone to sell to them, whether a dealer or a private seller.\nAs far as selling \u201cassault rifles\u201d to \u201cteenagers\u201d at retail stores, if you mean automatic weapons, you\u2019re not going to see those available over the counter for civilian purchase anywhere. If you want to actually own one of those, you\u2019d better be prepared to jump through a lot of prohibitive hoops, do some antique shopping, and shell out some big bucks. Yes, 18- and 19-year-olds can legally buy semi-automatic long guns with modular capabilities and aesthetics that look scary to the uninitiated. Of course those are not \u201cassault rifles.\u201d But it is illegal under federal law for anyone under the age of 18 to buy a long gun from a dealer, regardless of how scary or non-scary it looks to anti-gun activists.\nNow, let\u2019s talk about that \u201canti-trafficking law\u201d that Gillibrand mentioned. This is a talking point that doesn\u2019t make much sense if you\u2019re familiar with the laws already on the books. It\u2019s already illegal under federal law to purchase a gun with the intention of giving it to someone who is barred from purchasing it, and there\u2019s a maximum 10-year sentence attached. Furthermore, all gun transfers across state lines must go through federally licensed dealerswho, yes, must perform background checks.\nIt\u2019s hard to tell if anti-gun politicians are outright lying to voters or if they actually believe the misleading propaganda they are eagerly spreading to support their gun control agenda. What makes it even more embarrassing for Gillibrand in this case is that she\u2019s trying to run from her past support of the Second Amendment and even once boasted of keeping rifles under her bed.\nPoliticians who want to legislate against the Bill of Rights should at least have their facts straight first about all the laws we already do have to keep guns out of the hands of the incompetent or criminal.\nWant to keep up with what\u2019s going on in Washington without the liberal media slant, establishment spin, and politician-ese?\nSign up to get Blaze Media\u2019s Capitol Hill Brief in your inbox every morning!

See, the money will come out of the person&rsquo;s own Social Security account and it&rsquo;ll be like taking some vacation pay early, that&rsquo;s all. And besides, the American people want it so we should make sure we&rsquo;re out in front on this issue, you know, to show we care.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re going to build another socialist program off of another socialist program. A double-decker.</p>\n<p>And here I thought the <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TRSUM/\">SSA Trustees</a> had been telling the American people that Social Security will be depleted by 2034 and Social Security Disability Insurance sooner than that? I thought that as conservatives we&rsquo;re supposed to encourage people to rely on themselves and not the federal government? I thought that Social Security was the first big socialist program that the progressives foisted upon us and we are still trying to figure out how to keep the promises those lying progressives made? I thought that this socialist program was in trouble the minute people started living longer and the Boomer generation reached the age of 65?</p>\n<p>What about the fact that most people who would need the money are the ones least likely to have any to speak of?The example put forth to sell this plan discussed new parents in their 30s who would be able to draw from their Social Security for three months to be with their newborn. But wouldn&rsquo;t it be more likely that the people in their late teens and early twenties would be the ones that would be less established and need the money? They would be the ones who also haven&rsquo;t worked enough to build up much of a Social Security bank either.</p>\n<p>Provided there were such a thing as a &ldquo;Social Security bank,&rdquo; which there isn&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>The Washington Examiner <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/joni-ernst-mike-lee-roll-out-conservative-paid-parental-leave-idea\">points out</a> that particular concern of mine isn&rsquo;t going to be a problem for the couple in their teens and early twenties.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Benefit levels would be determined using the same formula used to determine Social Security Disability benefits. For instance, someone making $50,730 a year would get roughly $1,861 a month. Someone making the poverty level of $16,910 would get $960 a month.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So it&rsquo;s another welfare program. But I thought the Republicans are saying it&rsquo;s not another welfare program?</p>\n<p>Just saying, why do the people who put considerably less into the system automatically get more out of it percentage-wise?</p>\n<p>Why do Republicans do this? Does any of this help people take care of their own responsibilities? We already have numerous nutritional programs and healthcare programs to help the young parents who struggle. We, as Republicans, get beat on the head every single time the Left brings up our aversion to entitlements, but we never fight back with the fact that we have so many programs between the federal and state government intended to be used as safety nets when they are needed and then gotten the hell off of when people can do it themselves.</p>\n<p>But this whole program is a welfare program on top of an extremely shaky welfare program and some Republicans are gleeful because it doesn&rsquo;t start up a new tax.</p>\n<p>It will tax our Social Security system, which just last year became insolvent when the total cost of the program exceeded its total income. Yet Republicans think starting up another progressive social program on top of it will benefit future generations.</p>\n<p>How so?</p>\n<p><strong>Want to keep up with what&rsquo;s going on in Washington without the liberal media slant, establishment spin, and politician-ese?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up to get CRTV&rsquo;s Capitol Hill Brief in your inbox every evening!

                "text": "President Trump needs to be reelected in 2020, but the Republican Party makes it harder to do so when they mimic the lunatic Left.\nAs a grassroots conservative, the most frustrating thing to have to deal with come election time is to promote a candidate or back a Republican for reelection to gain or maintain a majority, when you know darn well that candidate or incumbent could backslide into the stupid and inexplicable positions owned by the Left.\nWe actually have a president who has identified the problem when he famously said, \u201cAmerica will never be a socialist country.\u201d We are at a point in time where the Left is no longer hiding the fact that they are socialists and unfortunately too many of the American populace are already, or on their way to being convinced, that top-down government control of their lives is exactly what they\u2019ve been waiting for.\nBut why oh why do we have to sit here and watch the Republican Party champion socialism while we have the winning message that socialism will destroy America?\nI could not believe my eyes when I read that Senators Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, actually proposed a paid family leave act with the acronym \u201cCRADLE.\u201d Who read that and didn\u2019t think, \u201ccradle to grave?\u201d And as we are trying to point out how terrible socialism is, the senators, their aides and their mouthpieces in the media are trying to make the program less terrible by saying it\u2019s \u201crevenue neutral.\u201d\nIt\u2019s no problem, they tell us. See, the money will come out of the person\u2019s own Social Security account and it\u2019ll be like taking some vacation pay early, that\u2019s all. And besides, the American people want it so we should make sure we\u2019re out in front on this issue, you know, to show we care.\nThey\u2019re going to build another socialist program off of another socialist program. A double-decker.\nAnd here I thought the SSA Trustees had been telling the American people that Social Security will be depleted by 2034 and Social Security Disability Insurance sooner than that? I thought that as conservatives we\u2019re supposed to encourage people to rely on themselves and not the federal government? I thought that Social Security was the first big socialist program that the progressives foisted upon us and we are still trying to figure out how to keep the promises those lying progressives made? I thought that this socialist program was in trouble the minute people started living longer and the Boomer generation reached the age of 65?\nWhat about the fact that most people who would need the money are the ones least likely to have any to speak of?The example put forth to sell this plan discussed new parents in their 30s who would be able to draw from their Social Security for three months to be with their newborn. But wouldn\u2019t it be more likely that the people in their late teens and early twenties would be the ones that would be less established and need the money? They would be the ones who also haven\u2019t worked enough to build up much of a Social Security bank either.\nProvided there were such a thing as a \u201cSocial Security bank,\u201d which there isn\u2019t.\nThe Washington Examiner points out that particular concern of mine isn\u2019t going to be a problem for the couple in their teens and early twenties.\nBenefit levels would be determined using the same formula used to determine Social Security Disability benefits. For instance, someone making $50,730 a year would get roughly $1,861 a month. Someone making the poverty level of $16,910 would get $960 a month.\nSo it\u2019s another welfare program. But I thought the Republicans are saying it\u2019s not another welfare program?\nJust saying, why do the people who put considerably less into the system automatically get more out of it percentage-wise?\nWhy do Republicans do this? Does any of this help people take care of their own responsibilities? We already have numerous nutritional programs and healthcare programs to help the young parents who struggle. We, as Republicans, get beat on the head every single time the Left brings up our aversion to entitlements, but we never fight back with the fact that we have so many programs between the federal and state government intended to be used as safety nets when they are needed and then gotten the hell off of when people can do it themselves.\nBut this whole program is a welfare program on top of an extremely shaky welfare program and some Republicans are gleeful because it doesn\u2019t start up a new tax.\nIt will tax our Social Security system, which just last year became insolvent when the total cost of the program exceeded its total income. Yet Republicans think starting up another progressive social program on top of it will benefit future generations.\nHow so?\nWant to keep up with what\u2019s going on in Washington without the liberal media slant, establishment spin, and politician-ese?\nSign up to get CRTV\u2019s Capitol Hill Brief in your inbox every evening!

Multiple news outlets including CNN and MSNBC blamed President Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;rhetoric&rdquo; for inciting the Australian murderer&rsquo;s slaughter of at least 49 victims.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This didn&rsquo;t happen in the United States. This was not an American who did this. This has nothing to do with our Second Amendment,&rdquo; Levin said. &ldquo;They have very strict gun laws in Australia, and they have strict gun laws in New Zealand. And both countries have laws against murdering people. There is evil on the face of this earth. I don&rsquo;t know if the media know it or not. What do you think ISIS is, and al Qaeda? And the Muslim Brotherhood? Our prisons are filled with evil people &mdash; mass murderers, rapists. Look around the world. Look at Un, and Xi, and Putin, and Castro, and all the rest.

                "text": "Friday on the radio, LevinTV host Mark Levin lit into the American media for claiming the president of the United States is at least partially responsible for the mass murder in a New Zealand mosque late Thursday. Multiple news outlets including CNN and MSNBC blamed President Trump\u2019s \u201crhetoric\u201d for inciting the Australian murderer\u2019s slaughter of at least 49 victims.\n\u201cThis didn\u2019t happen in the United States. This was not an American who did this. This has nothing to do with our Second Amendment,\u201d Levin said. \u201cThey have very strict gun laws in Australia, and they have strict gun laws in New Zealand. And both countries have laws against murdering people. There is evil on the face of this earth. I don\u2019t know if the media know it or not. What do you think ISIS is, and al Qaeda? And the Muslim Brotherhood? Our prisons are filled with evil people \u2014 mass murderers, rapists. Look around the world. Look at Un, and Xi, and Putin, and Castro, and all the rest. That\u2019s why you and I, we revere our Declaration. We revere our Constitution. We revere capitalism. We revere liberty. And we have people within our own country who attack these institutions that make and keep this nation a civil nation. We do not have a free press in this country; we have a propaganda mill.\u201d\n\u201cForty-nine human souls were slaughtered \u2026 and they\u2019re attacking our president,\u201d Levin said.\nListen:\nDon\u2019t miss an episode of LevinTV.

They&rsquo;ve called him Stalin. They&rsquo;ve called him Mussolini. They&rsquo;ve called him a white nationalist. A klansman. A white supremacist. They&rsquo;ve called him a neo-Nazi. They&rsquo;ve called him an anti-Semite. A racist. Every imaginable, horrific word of evil that they can muster, and they&rsquo;ve done this relentlessly,&rdquo; Levin continued.</p>\n<p>He added:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wonder how many death threats our president has received as a result of this kind of language from Democrats, Never Trumpers, and the media.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Turning to Ilhan Omar, Levin described the Minnesota congresswoman as a &ldquo;Jew-hating, anti-Semitic, anti-American radical.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She has portrayed herself this way because that&rsquo;s who she is. So has [Rashida] Tlaib. So has AOC. All three of them are truly insignificant figures, but the media continue to play them up, because the media are as radical as they get.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What this is all about &hellip; is an effort by the Democrat Party and the media to prevent her from being criticized,&rdquo; Levin said of Omar.</p>\n<p>Listen:</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/606814236&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe></figure>\n<blockquote> <p>The Democrat Party Is Unhinged</p> <p>You won&rsquo;t want to miss tonight&rsquo;s show! <a href=\"https://t.co/ICZsTSuMg1\">https://t.co/ICZsTSuMg1</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/lUIPncC3Hq\">pic.twitter.com/lUIPncC3Hq</a></p> <p>&mdash; LevinTV (@LevinTV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LevinTV/status/1116468635562840065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><a data-delivery=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=mdVSy5KEqXITkFumXjC2r%2FTy7R6O5%2FVwQaT3jCaNJLhwmWfqR2Pu2BHRv%2B%2B6hPryBSm%2Ffw4JVGpFy5%2BDLxcY2Ou9YHNPNzbbx6SY9xdaM7pLSB5HxLbgrNzA7zttopDuY2JMaJk1ByCYQKCDNXhU45d1kTwAtlHoChv7EU5iapesRrsdqDfaA4fueg8cGiQN4iDwH0ZxWy1BYX7f6gSNXmnAuZBmHXVJBRzGXb4VIbhljkRHq33JIHqnzF54DEfs0iCWjgCChtumpfhCxxj4Cq9BGCmcG8Tpr2ZMHSRppvaFkaOTxZZgnkLZMJdNwFVsxk%2Fnwr%2Fpk7G2XovP80h4m9U%2Bdio4FOjhHPrNHWLio8YM%2Bf3Oh6Xb66px9Lay0t5zV9t0eoKxoGEr7tlR7p%2BwDLLa26GhGvDoc1zdgmM8Figlr1RifDWBbCR1dfS2fq0tIDkBic329LLgdRP2rFM2YQu9KiN4WHyrkf2T5eo%2FkVYUjvGPYE5jIEqeWFRvKLJP23TDYjQAvsiQB7fu%2FRH9vWwIpHmA5ag0IaagXluue0IUQcsBEOEPSQI1Vc%2BrB2uYzAbT71kjll8zMW7%2B5oWlLFlv3MPtw%2Bps%2BENNNHj7w0xfiTxpLE4XfFtHIAstjfNkqlVhG93wHVx5welAx75I%2FqYxBg8eFdkESFRBd206oSrXwK3IeAyraeZebuZmm8WrNnCqlK8Ja%2FGgk%2Fb94NMR5O%2F6lKY4YOIpycd9OQ7AQ2Z1qo%2FBk8J4praNo5XFYX8scEI%2BDiJtriUF3JEE9nkvNIQJ%2BHneS4honc8F27tDBZGFgiqqPapfUbEuw8qdjlMKX0vmufjkQ29LaWESAr5lOuMdgVUdnjK8EOAM7r9pEZD83og82rxH8lCupqVBvejJxERhhc9Km5hKwTG0ugpboPT8GbZdSpMka2V%2BSRBEEFVMiqPmeR3w67lOso4ec%2F58xS7ElQKQC8tXjkcSGJ5IWgLY6wyJh9KjYt6iLhznzYnCQrOvaqbqYUp6jhHVRUjc3%2FMtXKGLE4ulEOHgwiqqGw%3D%3D&s2s=1\" data-id=\"mdVSy5KEqXITkFumXjC2r%2FTy7R6O5%2FVwQaT3jCaNJLhwmWfqR2Pu2BHRv%2B%2B6hPryBSm%2Ffw4JVGpFy5%2BDLxcY2Ou9YHNPNzbbx6SY9xdaM7pLSB5HxLbgrNzA7zttopDuY2JMaJk1ByCYQKCDNXhU45d1kTwAtlHoChv7EU5iapesRrsdqDfaA4fueg8cGiQN4iDwH0ZxWy1BYX7f6gSNXmnAuZBmHXVJBRzGXb4VIbhljkRHq33JIHqnzF54DEfs0iCWjgCChtumpfhCxxj4Cq9BGCmcG8Tpr2ZMHSRppvaFkaOTxZZgnkLZMJdNwFVsxk%2Fnwr%2Fpk7G2XovP80h4m9U%2Bdio4FOjhHPrNHWLio8YM%2Bf3Oh6Xb66px9Lay0t5zV9t0eoKxoGEr7tlR7p%2BwDLLa26GhGvDoc1zdgmM8Figlr1RifDWBbCR1dfS2fq0tIDkBic329LLgdRP2rFM2YQu9KiN4WHyrkf2T5eo%2FkVYUjvGPYE5jIEqeWFRvKLJP23TDYjQAvsiQB7fu%2FRH9vWwIpHmA5ag0IaagXluue0IUQcsBEOEPSQI1Vc%2BrB2uYzAbT71kjll8zMW7%2B5oWlLFlv3MPtw%2Bps%2BENNNHj7w0xfiTxpLE4XfFtHIAstjfNkqlVhG93wHVx5welAx75I%2FqYxBg8eFdkESFRBd206oSrXwK3IeAyraeZebuZmm8WrNnCqlK8Ja%2FGgk%2Fb94NMR5O%2F6lKY4YOIpycd9OQ7AQ2Z1qo%2FBk8J4praNo5XFYX8scEI%2BDiJtriUF3JEE9nkvNIQJ%2BHneS4honc8F27tDBZGFgiqqPapfUbEuw8qdjlMKX0vmufjkQ29LaWESAr5lOuMdgVUdnjK8EOAM7r9pEZD83og82rxH8lCupqVBvejJxERhhc9Km5hKwTG0ugpboPT8GbZdSpMka2V%2BSRBEEFVMiqPmeR3w67lOso4ec%2F58xS7ElQKQC8tXjkcSGJ5IWgLY6wyJh9KjYt6iLhznzYnCQrOvaqbqYUp6jhHVRUjc3%2FMtXKGLE4ulEOHgwiqqGw%3D%3D\" data-target=\"https://pro.oxfordclub.com/m/1356476?rev_campaign_id=613580\" href=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=mdVSy5KEqXITkFumXjC2r%2FTy7R6O5%2FVwQaT3jCaNJLhwmWfqR2Pu2BHRv%2B%2B6hPryBSm%2Ffw4JVGpFy5%2BDLxcY2Ou9YHNPNzbbx6SY9xdaM7pLSB5HxLbgrNzA7zttopDuY2JMaJk1ByCYQKCDNXhU45d1kTwAtlHoChv7EU5iapesRrsdqDfaA4fueg8cGiQN4iDwH0ZxWy1BYX7f6gSNXmnAuZBmHXVJBRzGXb4VIbhljkRHq33JIHqnzF54DEfs0iCWjgCChtumpfhCxxj4Cq9BGCmcG8Tpr2ZMHSRppvaFkaOTxZZgnkLZMJdNwFVsxk%2Fnwr%2Fpk7G2XovP80h4m9U%2Bdio4FOjhHPrNHWLio8YM%2Bf3Oh6Xb66px9Lay0t5zV9t0eoKxoGEr7tlR7p%2BwDLLa26GhGvDoc1zdgmM8Figlr1RifDWBbCR1dfS2fq0tIDkBic329LLgdRP2rFM2YQu9KiN4WHyrkf2T5eo%2FkVYUjvGPYE5jIEqeWFRvKLJP23TDYjQAvsiQB7fu%2FRH9vWwIpHmA5ag0IaagXluue0IUQcsBEOEPSQI1Vc%2BrB2uYzAbT71kjll8zMW7%2B5oWlLFlv3MPtw%2Bps%2BENNNHj7w0xfiTxpLE4XfFtHIAstjfNkqlVhG93wHVx5welAx75I%2FqYxBg8eFdkESFRBd206oSrXwK3IeAyraeZebuZmm8WrNnCqlK8Ja%2FGgk%2Fb94NMR5O%2F6lKY4YOIpycd9OQ7AQ2Z1qo%2FBk8J4praNo5XFYX8scEI%2BDiJtriUF3JEE9nkvNIQJ%2BHneS4honc8F27tDBZGFgiqqPapfUbEuw8qdjlMKX0vmufjkQ29LaWESAr5lOuMdgVUdnjK8EOAM7r9pEZD83og82rxH8lCupqVBvejJxERhhc9Km5hKwTG0ugpboPT8GbZdSpMka2V%2BSRBEEFVMiqPmeR3w67lOso4ec%2F58xS7ElQKQC8tXjkcSGJ5IWgLY6wyJh9KjYt6iLhznzYnCQrOvaqbqYUp6jhHVRUjc3%2FMtXKGLE4ulEOHgwiqqGw%3D%3D&s2s=1\"><figure><video src=\"https://videos.revcontent.com/revcontent/video/upload/c_pad,h_240,w_426,b_blurred:400,f_mp4/v1579628040/revcontent-p0/cr_videos/9597/4213758.mp4\"> </video></figure></a></p>",

They\u2019ve called him Stalin. They\u2019ve called him Mussolini. They\u2019ve called him a white nationalist. A klansman. A white supremacist. They\u2019ve called him a neo-Nazi. They\u2019ve called him an anti-Semite. A racist. Every imaginable, horrific word of evil that they can muster, and they\u2019ve done this relentlessly,\u201d Levin continued.\nHe added:\n\u201cI wonder how many death threats our president has received as a result of this kind of language from Democrats, Never Trumpers, and the media.\u201d\nTurning to Ilhan Omar, Levin described the Minnesota congresswoman as a \u201cJew-hating, anti-Semitic, anti-American radical.\u201d\n\u201cShe has portrayed herself this way because that\u2019s who she is. So has [Rashida] Tlaib. So has AOC. All three of them are truly insignificant figures, but the media continue to play them up, because the media are as radical as they get.\u201d\n\u201cWhat this is all about \u2026 is an effort by the Democrat Party and the media to prevent her from being criticized,\u201d Levin said of Omar.\nListen:\nThe Democrat Party Is Unhinged\nYou won\u2019t want to miss tonight\u2019s show! https://t.co/ICZsTSuMg1 pic.twitter.com/lUIPncC3Hq\n\u2014 LevinTV (@LevinTV) April 11, 2019",

Sunday night, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough jumped into the fray with a misleading historic take on why the AR-15 modern sporting rifle (MSR) platform is supposedly a battlefield weapon that shouldn&rsquo;t be protected by the Supreme Court&rsquo;s Second Amendment cases.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"> <p>Those suggesting the AR-15 was NOT developed as a weapon of war should read up on history. The AR-15 was developed as a military weapon to replace the M-14. Eugene Stoner designed it to be lighter and more lethal than the M-14. <br>It was far deadlier than the M-16 used in Vietnam.</p> <p>&mdash; Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeNBC/status/1107448713394425856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>And 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Robert O&rsquo;Rourke said something similar over the weekend, calling the AR-15 a &ldquo;weapon of war.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"> <p>Beto O'Rourke: &quot;If you own an AR-15, keep it. Continue to use it responsibly and safely. I just don't think that we need to sell anymore weapons of war into this public.&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/uqMA1jWOTf\">pic.twitter.com/uqMA1jWOTf</a></p> <p>&mdash; The Hill (@thehill) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1107069284356894720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 17, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>So let&rsquo;s clear up a few facts:</p>\n<ul> <li>As <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1590518394401209\">I&rsquo;ve explained before</a>, in the late 1950s, small-arms whiz Eugene Stoner started designing prototypes for the United States military, with a heavy focus on making issued rifles lighter and theoretically allowing troops to carry more ammunition.</li> <li>In 1956, Stoner and his team at Armalite started work on the AR-15 prototype, which followed the AR-10 prototype. AR stands for &ldquo;Armalite Rifle,&rdquo; not &ldquo;assault rifle&rdquo; or &ldquo;automatic rifle.&rdquo;</li> <li>The company had a hard time selling the original design and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/02/28/588861820/a-brief-history-of-the-ar-15\">licensed it to Colt in 1959</a>.</li> <li>In 1963, the original fully automatic, select-fire Armalite turned into to Colt&rsquo;s design for the newly commissioned M16. That same year, Colt released a semi-automatic version of the AR-15 modular platform to <a href=\"http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=116\">the law enforcement and civilian market</a>.</li> <li>When the patent expired in 1977, other manufacturers got in on the MSR game.</li> <li>The typical MSR you&rsquo;ll find on the wall at your nearest gun store is semi-automatic and fires a .223 round. That means a smaller cartridge and one bullet fired per trigger pull, compared to what became the M16, which used a higher-pressure 5.56 cartridge.</li> <li>Some MSRs fire both 5.56 rounds and .223 rounds. The main difference is that the 5.56 can have more powder behind the bullet, though not always. A .223 can be fired out of a 5.56-chambered rifle (although with diminished pressure) <a href=\"https://loadoutroom.com/thearmsguide/is-there-a-difference-between-223-and-5-56/\">but not vice versa</a>. But they&rsquo;re still semi-automatic either way.</li> <li>This means that in both the ammunition it fires and the rate at which it fires, the AR-15 is more akin to the famous Ruger Mini14 ranch rifle than the M4 carbine, which is what&rsquo;s been putting rounds <a href=\"https://taskandpurpose.com/why-the-military-is-moving-on-from-the-m16\">downrange for the Department of Defense since 1994</a>. No AR-15 marketed for civilian use is an automatic rifle.</li> <li>If you want to legally purchase an automatic firearm made before 1986, there are a ton of prohibitive <a href=\"https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2014/05/21/machine-guns-legal-practical-guide-full-auto/\">bureaucratic hoops you have to jump through</a> (plus, they&rsquo;re incredibly expensive because of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/its-still-legal-to-own-a-machine-gun-its-also-extremely-difficult-and-especially-expensive\">1986 ban</a>). If you want to buy one made after 1986, you either need to be a law enforcement officer with a reason to have it or a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL).</li> <li>Despite the hype, <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/02/19/knives-gun-control-fbi-statistics/\">rifles killed fewer people than knives</a>, blunt objects, and fists in the U.S. in 2016, according to FBI stats.</li> </ul>\n<p>Furthermore, people who like to point out that MSRs are popular with shooters need to realize that that&rsquo;s probably because MSRs are just popular in general. The design is light, low-recoil, and &ndash; because of its modular design &ndash; easily customizable. That means that no matter how your body is configured or what your specific needs are, you can typically find a way shoot comfortably. Those are features that all kinds of shooters, from target shooters to farmers and hunters, find useful.</p>\n<p>But saying such features themselves somehow make it easier for evil people to shoot up innocents is like saying that a popular model of motor vehicle should be banned because the seat-warmers, adjustable steering column, and extra cup holders make it more popular among drunk drivers.</p>\n<p>The fact that so many prominent anti-gun people think that the modern sporting rifle available to civilian purchasers today is a weapon that is used or even proposed for use in combat just shows how little they understand about guns. And if you&rsquo;re going to try to ban something or criminalize people&rsquo;s legally purchased property, you&rsquo;d better at least have your facts straight about it.</p>\n<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: An earlier version of this article said that the 5.56 cartridge is &ldquo;bigger&rdquo; than the .223 rather than &ldquo;higher-pressure.&rdquo; It has been edited for clarity. The earlier version also said that at 5.56 cartridge &ldquo;has more powder behind the bullet.&rdquo; It has been corrected to &ldquo;can have more powder behind the bullet, though not always.&rdquo; CR regrets the error.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Want to keep up with what&rsquo;s going on in Washington without the liberal media slant, establishment spin, and politician-ese?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up to get Blaze Media&rsquo;s Capitol Hill Brief in your inbox every morning!

                "text": "The New York Times says that after last week\u2019s horrific shooting attack on two mosques, New Zealand is having \u201cits gun-debate moment.\u201d And of course, since New Zealand is having a gun-debate moment (despite already having stringent gun control laws), the U.S. anti-gun crowd has to jump in too, once again spreading disinformation about anti-gun activists\u2019 favorite boogeyman: the AR-15.\nEvery time a semi-automatic rifle with modern-looking aesthetics is used by a bad person to do evil, anti-gun politicians and pundits flood the zone with misinformation and misleading talking points. Sunday night, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough jumped into the fray with a misleading historic take on why the AR-15 modern sporting rifle (MSR) platform is supposedly a battlefield weapon that shouldn\u2019t be protected by the Supreme Court\u2019s Second Amendment cases.\nThose suggesting the AR-15 was NOT developed as a weapon of war should read up on history. The AR-15 was developed as a military weapon to replace the M-14. Eugene Stoner designed it to be lighter and more lethal than the M-14.\nIt was far deadlier than the M-16 used in Vietnam.\n\u2014 Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 18, 2019\nAnd 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Robert O\u2019Rourke said something similar over the weekend, calling the AR-15 a \u201cweapon of war.\u201d\nBeto O'Rourke: \"If you own an AR-15, keep it. Continue to use it responsibly and safely. I just don't think that we need to sell anymore weapons of war into this public.\" pic.twitter.com/uqMA1jWOTf\n\u2014 The Hill (@thehill) March 17, 2019\nSo let\u2019s clear up a few facts:\nAs I\u2019ve explained before, in the late 1950s, small-arms whiz Eugene Stoner started designing prototypes for the United States military, with a heavy focus on making issued rifles lighter and theoretically allowing troops to carry more ammunition.\nIn 1956, Stoner and his team at Armalite started work on the AR-15 prototype, which followed the AR-10 prototype. AR stands for \u201cArmalite Rifle,\u201d not \u201cassault rifle\u201d or \u201cautomatic rifle.\u201d\nThe company had a hard time selling the original design and licensed it to Colt in 1959.\nIn 1963, the original fully automatic, select-fire Armalite turned into to Colt\u2019s design for the newly commissioned M16. That same year, Colt released a semi-automatic version of the AR-15 modular platform to the law enforcement and civilian market.\nWhen the patent expired in 1977, other manufacturers got in on the MSR game.\nThe typical MSR you\u2019ll find on the wall at your nearest gun store is semi-automatic and fires a .223 round. That means a smaller cartridge and one bullet fired per trigger pull, compared to what became the M16, which used a higher-pressure 5.56 cartridge.\nSome MSRs fire both 5.56 rounds and .223 rounds. The main difference is that the 5.56 can have more powder behind the bullet, though not always. A .223 can be fired out of a 5.56-chambered rifle (although with diminished pressure) but not vice versa. But they\u2019re still semi-automatic either way.\nThis means that in both the ammunition it fires and the rate at which it fires, the AR-15 is more akin to the famous Ruger Mini14 ranch rifle than the M4 carbine, which is what\u2019s been putting rounds downrange for the Department of Defense since 1994. No AR-15 marketed for civilian use is an automatic rifle.\nIf you want to legally purchase an automatic firearm made before 1986, there are a ton of prohibitive bureaucratic hoops you have to jump through (plus, they\u2019re incredibly expensive because of the 1986 ban). If you want to buy one made after 1986, you either need to be a law enforcement officer with a reason to have it or a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL).\nDespite the hype, rifles killed fewer people than knives, blunt objects, and fists in the U.S. in 2016, according to FBI stats.\nFurthermore, people who like to point out that MSRs are popular with shooters need to realize that that\u2019s probably because MSRs are just popular in general. The design is light, low-recoil, and \u2013 because of its modular design \u2013 easily customizable. That means that no matter how your body is configured or what your specific needs are, you can typically find a way shoot comfortably. Those are features that all kinds of shooters, from target shooters to farmers and hunters, find useful.\nBut saying such features themselves somehow make it easier for evil people to shoot up innocents is like saying that a popular model of motor vehicle should be banned because the seat-warmers, adjustable steering column, and extra cup holders make it more popular among drunk drivers.\nThe fact that so many prominent anti-gun people think that the modern sporting rifle available to civilian purchasers today is a weapon that is used or even proposed for use in combat just shows how little they understand about guns. And if you\u2019re going to try to ban something or criminalize people\u2019s legally purchased property, you\u2019d better at least have your facts straight about it.\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this article said that the 5.56 cartridge is \u201cbigger\u201d than the .223 rather than \u201chigher-pressure.\u201d It has been edited for clarity. The earlier version also said that at 5.56 cartridge \u201chas more powder behind the bullet.\u201d It has been corrected to \u201ccan have more powder behind the bullet, though not always.\u201d CR regrets the error.\nWant to keep up with what\u2019s going on in Washington without the liberal media slant, establishment spin, and politician-ese?\nSign up to get Blaze Media\u2019s Capitol Hill Brief in your inbox every morning!

No questions were asked. Yet almost a year into an invasion of unimaginable security, cultural, health care, and fiscal concerns, we are told that unless there are 60 votes in the Senate and every district judge agrees &ndash; something that will never happen even after Republicans win in 2020 &ndash; there is nothing Trump can do with his executive and delegated authority to grind all illegal immigration to a halt. This is simply not true. It&rsquo;s time to build the will, even more than the wall.</p>\n<p>The open-borders movement began with the premise that we must grant amnesty to those who successfully evaded deportation for 20 years and have put down roots here. However, nobody throughout our history, even recent history, suggested that we sit idly and import millions of <em>new</em> illegal aliens and refuse to deport a single person among those who just come in and abscond from their court appearances. Yet that is what&rsquo;s happening now, and we are all acting as if we need 91 district courts and 60 senators in order to protect our country.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s all a matter of will.</p>\n<p>We have never had such a severe and blatant invasion through migration last this long without the president implementing a plan to shut it down. During the Mariel boatlifts of Cubans in 1980, the Nicaraguan influx into Texas in 1989, the Haitian boat migration in the early 1990s, and even the first Central American surge under Obama in 2014, the various presidents eventually took action to shut down the flow, even without an immediate legislative fix. After two months of Cuban boatlifts in May and June 1980, totaling more than 100,000 aliens, the flow was shut off to a trickle and eventually ended by the fall. In 1989, after tens of thousands of Nicaraguans came in and demanded asylum, a &ldquo;rocket docket&rdquo; was set up in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/21/us/us-set-to-detain-refugees-in-tents-beginning-today.html\">tent cities</a> in south Texas to immediately adjudicate their cases and ship them out.</p>\n<p>During the Haitian sea migration in the early 1990s, Presidents Bush and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/15/world/clinton-says-us-will-continue-ban-on-haitian-exodus.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=0F4AC96C47D610128F702564282CD36B&gwt=pay\">Clinton sent out the Coast Guard to prevent</a> them from landing and returned them home immediately. In <em>Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc.</em> (1993), a case Chief Justice Roberts <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/news/no-judge-has-jurisdiction-to-erase-our-border/\">just referenced in his favorable opinion to Trump in the travel ban case</a>, the Supreme Court made it clear that presidential power to exclude all aliens at the border overrides even asylum requests.</p>\n<p>Yet here we are today with the invasion now so bad that the cartels and smugglers have created a transport system to streamline more migration than ever and incentivize more Central Americans to come without fear of a harsh journey. The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/amp-stories/conveyor-belt-immigration/\">Washington Post reports</a> that Mexican smugglers have now set up a &ldquo;conveyor belt system&rdquo; of express buses &ldquo;to minimize overhead and maximize capacity,&rdquo; creating the biggest incentives to come in the largest numbers. We have never had such an orchestrated invasion by so many terrible human beings involved with violent cartels <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/news/mexicans-are-paying-in-blood-for-our-central-american-amnesty-policies/\">taking advantage of people on both sides of the border</a> so efficiently.</p>\n<p>The numbers have been much greater than any previous sudden influx of asylum seekers, and it has been going on much longer without any effort to shut it down. If we add the number of family units and unaccompanied children who came here from the Central American countries since 2014, the tally is approaching one million. Almost none of them have been deported except for the brief period when Obama was shutting off the first wave in 2014. Now, there is no bottom in sight to this insanity if the president doesn&rsquo;t set one now.</p>\n<p>While some might not view hundreds of thousands of impoverished, unassimilable migrants as an invasion, the <em>weaponizing of migration</em> by the organizers of these caravans is certainly making this an invasion, just like Castro did when he weaponized migration against us with the Mariel boatlift. Both in terms of <a href=\"https://www.securefreesociety.org/publications/sitrep-central-american-caravans/\">the anti-American organizers of the caravans</a> and the Mexican cartels who use the migrants as distractions to get in dangerous criminals and drugs, this is definitely an orchestrated event to take advantage of poor migrants to harm America. In some ways, the effects are more irreversible than those of a traditional invasion.</p>\n<p>If Boeing, which is directly the subject of Trump&rsquo;s FAA order, sued in a district court and a forum-shopped judge put an injunction on the order, would this administration allow these planes to fly? Now imagine a judge usurping the power to <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/news/no-judge-has-jurisdiction-to-erase-our-border/\">grant standing to foreign caravans</a> or third-party groups representing them. No other president in any other era would allow this to go on.</p>\n<p>The language of the relevant statute (section 212(f) of the INA) <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/news/its-time-for-trump-to-use-his-trump-card-on-immigration/\">is as clear as can be</a>:</p>\n<p>Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.</p>\n<p>Trump can halt all immigration and cross-border commerce for any reason if he determines it&rsquo;s in the national interest. This is no weaker and in fact is much stronger than the authorizing statute to ground planes:</p>\n<p>When the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is of the opinion that an emergency exists related to safety in <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=49-USC-695674097-427448092&term_occur=70&term_src=title:49:subtitle:VII:part:A:subpart:iv:chapter:461:section:46105\">air commerce</a> and requires immediate action, the Administrator, on the initiative of the Administrator or on complaint, may prescribe regulations and issue orders immediately to meet the emergency, with or without notice and without regard to this part and subchapter II of <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/chapter-5\">chapter 5 of title 5</a>. [49 U.S. Code &sect; 46105]</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s time for the president to completely halt all acceptance of any credible fear claims at our border and immediately turn back anyone coming here. The Constitution and statute are on Trump&rsquo;s side.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also time for the administration to play diplomatic hardball with Mexico. NAFTA should be renegotiated again with the top priority focused not on trade issues but over Mexico holding any Central American migrants. The reality is that this move, if sustained, would not need to continue indefinitely, because the Central Americans will stop coming once they know they can&rsquo;t come to the United States. They have no interest in flooding Mexico as an endpoint. Those who manage to get in anyway should be <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/news/heres-real-emergency-border-plan-look-like/\">sent to tent cities with a &ldquo;rocket docket</a>&rdquo; of immigration judges at the front lines, as we did during past migration influxes.</p>\n<p>Trump has no choice but to assert commonsense powers already <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/news/the-full-case-for-why-courts-have-no-jurisdiction-over-trumps-immigration-order/\">upheld by the Supreme Court numerous times</a>. What is he waiting for? Nothing will change with this election, even in the best-case scenario. Republicans, and certainly not conservatives, will not secure 60 votes in the Senate, even if they win back control of the House and Trump is re-elected. This invasion will continue to spiral out of control, yet pigs will fly before Congress will act.

Congress can never write a statute more unambiguous and granting the president more unconditional power to shut off even legal immigration than 212(f).</p>\n<p>We either have the will to be a sovereign nation or we don&rsquo;t.

                "text": "On Wednesday, President Trump, acting in response to the fear that Boeing 737 MAX planes may be unsafe to fly due to two similar accidents, issued an emergency order through the FAA administrator to ground the Boeing 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 from flying in and out of our country. No questions were asked. Yet almost a year into an invasion of unimaginable security, cultural, health care, and fiscal concerns, we are told that unless there are 60 votes in the Senate and every district judge agrees \u2013 something that will never happen even after Republicans win in 2020 \u2013 there is nothing Trump can do with his executive and delegated authority to grind all illegal immigration to a halt. This is simply not true. It\u2019s time to build the will, even more than the wall.\nThe open-borders movement began with the premise that we must grant amnesty to those who successfully evaded deportation for 20 years and have put down roots here. However, nobody throughout our history, even recent history, suggested that we sit idly and import millions of new illegal aliens and refuse to deport a single person among those who just come in and abscond from their court appearances. Yet that is what\u2019s happening now, and we are all acting as if we need 91 district courts and 60 senators in order to protect our country.\nIt\u2019s all a matter of will.\nWe have never had such a severe and blatant invasion through migration last this long without the president implementing a plan to shut it down. During the Mariel boatlifts of Cubans in 1980, the Nicaraguan influx into Texas in 1989, the Haitian boat migration in the early 1990s, and even the first Central American surge under Obama in 2014, the various presidents eventually took action to shut down the flow, even without an immediate legislative fix. After two months of Cuban boatlifts in May and June 1980, totaling more than 100,000 aliens, the flow was shut off to a trickle and eventually ended by the fall. In 1989, after tens of thousands of Nicaraguans came in and demanded asylum, a \u201crocket docket\u201d was set up in tent cities in south Texas to immediately adjudicate their cases and ship them out.\nDuring the Haitian sea migration in the early 1990s, Presidents Bush and Clinton sent out the Coast Guard to prevent them from landing and returned them home immediately. In Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc. (1993), a case Chief Justice Roberts just referenced in his favorable opinion to Trump in the travel ban case, the Supreme Court made it clear that presidential power to exclude all aliens at the border overrides even asylum requests.\nYet here we are today with the invasion now so bad that the cartels and smugglers have created a transport system to streamline more migration than ever and incentivize more Central Americans to come without fear of a harsh journey. The Washington Post reports that Mexican smugglers have now set up a \u201cconveyor belt system\u201d of express buses \u201cto minimize overhead and maximize capacity,\u201d creating the biggest incentives to come in the largest numbers. We have never had such an orchestrated invasion by so many terrible human beings involved with violent cartels taking advantage of people on both sides of the border so efficiently.\nThe numbers have been much greater than any previous sudden influx of asylum seekers, and it has been going on much longer without any effort to shut it down. If we add the number of family units and unaccompanied children who came here from the Central American countries since 2014, the tally is approaching one million. Almost none of them have been deported except for the brief period when Obama was shutting off the first wave in 2014. Now, there is no bottom in sight to this insanity if the president doesn\u2019t set one now.\nWhile some might not view hundreds of thousands of impoverished, unassimilable migrants as an invasion, the weaponizing of migration by the organizers of these caravans is certainly making this an invasion, just like Castro did when he weaponized migration against us with the Mariel boatlift. Both in terms of the anti-American organizers of the caravans and the Mexican cartels who use the migrants as distractions to get in dangerous criminals and drugs, this is definitely an orchestrated event to take advantage of poor migrants to harm America. In some ways, the effects are more irreversible than those of a traditional invasion.\nIf Boeing, which is directly the subject of Trump\u2019s FAA order, sued in a district court and a forum-shopped judge put an injunction on the order, would this administration allow these planes to fly? Now imagine a judge usurping the power to grant standing to foreign caravans or third-party groups representing them. No other president in any other era would allow this to go on.\nThe language of the relevant statute (section 212(f) of the INA) is as clear as can be:\nWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\nTrump can halt all immigration and cross-border commerce for any reason if he determines it\u2019s in the national interest. This is no weaker and in fact is much stronger than the authorizing statute to ground planes:\nWhen the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is of the opinion that an emergency exists related to safety in air commerce and requires immediate action, the Administrator, on the initiative of the Administrator or on complaint, may prescribe regulations and issue orders immediately to meet the emergency, with or without notice and without regard to this part and subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. [49 U.S. Code \u00a7 46105]\nIt\u2019s time for the president to completely halt all acceptance of any credible fear claims at our border and immediately turn back anyone coming here. The Constitution and statute are on Trump\u2019s side.\nIt\u2019s also time for the administration to play diplomatic hardball with Mexico. NAFTA should be renegotiated again with the top priority focused not on trade issues but over Mexico holding any Central American migrants. The reality is that this move, if sustained, would not need to continue indefinitely, because the Central Americans will stop coming once they know they can\u2019t come to the United States. They have no interest in flooding Mexico as an endpoint. Those who manage to get in anyway should be sent to tent cities with a \u201crocket docket\u201d of immigration judges at the front lines, as we did during past migration influxes.\nTrump has no choice but to assert commonsense powers already upheld by the Supreme Court numerous times. What is he waiting for? Nothing will change with this election, even in the best-case scenario. Republicans, and certainly not conservatives, will not secure 60 votes in the Senate, even if they win back control of the House and Trump is re-elected. This invasion will continue to spiral out of control, yet pigs will fly before Congress will act. And as I\u2019ve noted before, passing new laws won\u2019t even help anyway, because the judicial-supremacy courts are asserting that Trump can\u2019t follow existing laws of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Congress can never write a statute more unambiguous and granting the president more unconditional power to shut off even legal immigration than 212(f).\nWe either have the will to be a sovereign nation or we don\u2019t. Everything else is just an excuse and a distraction.\nFind out what the mainstream media won\u2019t tell you about President Trump and his administration.\nSign up to get BlazeTV host Jon Miller\u2019s free White House Brief delivered right to your inbox once a day.",

Last year, some 875 churches in the country were vandalized, which include regular acts of arson and desecration, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8804063/france-church-arson-attacks-vandalism-christian-heritage/\">according</a> to French police figures reported by The Sun.</p>\n<p>Officials have not determined the cause of the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Paris Prosecutor Remy Heitz <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/notre-dame-fire-was-likely-accident-not-arson-prosecutor/a-48348777\">suspected</a> Tuesday that the fire was likely an accident, but there was no evidence to determine anything just yet. He added that a team of 50 people were investigating the cause of the blaze, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-notredame-prosecutor-idUSKCN1RS0UM?utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5cb5e8460f1cfa0001e688e1&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter\">according</a> to Reuters.</p>\n<p>For the past few years, Smith has regularly peddled Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theories on his Fox News show.</p>\n<p>In July 2017, Smith described the White House&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jul/15/shepard-smith-host-fox-news-trump-lies\">actions</a> related to the Mueller probe as &ldquo;deception&rdquo; and &ldquo;mind-blogging.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Why all these lies? &hellip; Why is it lie after lie after lie,&rdquo; Smith added.</p>\n<p>In February 2018, he castigated the president for <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/shep-smith-mueller-indictments-not-hoax_n_5a876688e4b00bc49f441bb3\">describing</a> the Russia hoax accurately. Smith took to the airwaves to declare the investigation &ldquo;the opposite of a hoax.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As evidence for his Trump-Russia conspiracies, Smith <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/2018/03/shep-smith-calls-trump-never-criticizing-putin-even-russian-diplomats-get-expelled/#.Wrl7gcFQpZk.twitter\">attempts</a> to point to apparent evidence of wrongdoing by calling out the president for not personally insulting Russian President Vladimir Putin to his satisfaction.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Shameful, disgraceful, treasonous: Three of the descriptions of what President Donald Trump did today in Helsinki,&rdquo; Smith, who posits himself as an objective journalist, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/16/trump-putin-fox-news-724372\">commented</a> in response to the president&rsquo;s July 2018 meeting with Putin. &ldquo;President Trump declined to stand up for his own people and instead embraced Vladimir Putin,&rdquo; Smith added.</p>\n<p>The Fox host has also regularly <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/421961-shep-smith-theory-flynn-was-tricked-by-fbi-floated-by-its-defenders-here-and\">dismissed</a> the mountains of evidence that Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, among other Trump-tied individuals, were set up by the FBI and other elements of the Obama Intelligence Community.</p>\n<p>As we now know, thanks to a four-page summary of the Robert Mueller report that is due out Thursday, there was never any Trump-Russia collusion or criminal deception in the form of obstruction.</p>\n<p>Smith has never apologized for promulgating the debunked Russia collusion hoax since the beginning of the Trump presidency. And given his smug and dismissive attitude concerning the ongoing arson epidemic against churches in France, we shouldn&rsquo;t hold our breath expecting an apology in this case anytime soon.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/conservativereview/2018/03/the-dossier-header-graphic.jpg\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/conservativereview/2018/03/the-dossier-header-graphic.jpg 600w, https://storage.googleapis.com/conservativereview/2018/03/the-dossier-header-graphic-150x63.jpg 150w, https://storage.googleapis.com/conservativereview/2018/03/the-dossier-header-graphic-300x125.jpg 300w\"></img><figcaption>Find out what&rsquo;s really going on in the national security world.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Sign up to get The Dossier in your inbox twice a week.</strong></p>\n<p><a data-delivery=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=QYBIGtCUrybhpIX5kL06EYi2xVkmLarFovUrbr%2FDGx1wcUTj8oiOCbRfwvHvHEE7P3qE%2FYw823X06GLf78EaZ7BVvgLZcP65Q8aS%2FTdhw9Iv0nFpKD9JTyn4N1K4CvR3wzzejXl1OhBwOGvQ6h8mTix2WPrGuUyjQzaCDJ7SZSrSRWEmB6bTy2d9N2nmbHKK44%2Bnm1FjusaW9gcrlvn0xXZit0bf6Iw%2FaRBp3UDDkJ3OUw5haFmK6GoPifP%2F7tT6KU8o3fDdrFgif3hyfHLFD4%2BSuo4KkB9NaZj4WFJ9n5A7UBmrGlmj%2Bb5R8yHNIIpRJvr63CiyxD5B6nomVtE2cwEnFkIxwR%2F66w7XPxouyIlR50aK3pljPsvJ4JRU7CfnsTUi7XqTjD0p2%2FPEn5VAQjmzIxWQte33oQs%2FVlh7BmNq9v9fz4wcqGuKpYavNHS%2B88GzpnDT1BZd66gSnqPhSYnZgiFTxGgb%2B0Q6ohUokllJ0fATf6AQ7srTDlP4%2BWEztWomVsK3%2F3jQIRRKyOJBR5%2BmPaptstckYtdQ6FeHBnm4%2BTQTfnVlqRy1FCdbwyaqSbskEit5u%2BjwCsRC6BmZ8eaOohgXEFKrQeKzeBEOY0283X24jCEArCBmb6nsyPc9M0jSgNLet%2BKWQKmNKMswbFb9DZprCY63MfpVFLtFuNoVNrUfoVi5oeCgBqtm92Xmg%2BhifUhCk8Yk%2BYObpxXv7tau%2BPmzdpNLCeThTFsoBECnplVnlIkG%2BQl0a3R4jn3CnfS0owlduaDtHjvXq2jtC%2FLNHtDuxtbDhgUKNjKIwYefHZz8fDLWKBaRSCDhZ4mkt%2B6H6VTKBEC%2BwkYwndcnLB26Vk%2FubKVq%2B4v9eI%2FGMhsID%2BX2o%2FUEsYasmrP3aPf8jFrK9uMfTzLXeES2CN8VIpkg5yZn17WZjjqOIumD0Nps4tVc1FMkBba2kpbAqC%2B8bxors9AA5DEVnbAUypVRewnpCeP9sVKnaitGlbJwqE381LNL2f9XwGrfGt9Dbj5E8g6x2ezk%2Bi7Rsfit%2FYlmfg%3D%3D&s2s=1\" data-id=\"QYBIGtCUrybhpIX5kL06EYi2xVkmLarFovUrbr%2FDGx1wcUTj8oiOCbRfwvHvHEE7P3qE%2FYw823X06GLf78EaZ7BVvgLZcP65Q8aS%2FTdhw9Iv0nFpKD9JTyn4N1K4CvR3wzzejXl1OhBwOGvQ6h8mTix2WPrGuUyjQzaCDJ7SZSrSRWEmB6bTy2d9N2nmbHKK44%2Bnm1FjusaW9gcrlvn0xXZit0bf6Iw%2FaRBp3UDDkJ3OUw5haFmK6GoPifP%2F7tT6KU8o3fDdrFgif3hyfHLFD4%2BSuo4KkB9NaZj4WFJ9n5A7UBmrGlmj%2Bb5R8yHNIIpRJvr63CiyxD5B6nomVtE2cwEnFkIxwR%2F66w7XPxouyIlR50aK3pljPsvJ4JRU7CfnsTUi7XqTjD0p2%2FPEn5VAQjmzIxWQte33oQs%2FVlh7BmNq9v9fz4wcqGuKpYavNHS%2B88GzpnDT1BZd66gSnqPhSYnZgiFTxGgb%2B0Q6ohUokllJ0fATf6AQ7srTDlP4%2BWEztWomVsK3%2F3jQIRRKyOJBR5%2BmPaptstckYtdQ6FeHBnm4%2BTQTfnVlqRy1FCdbwyaqSbskEit5u%2BjwCsRC6BmZ8eaOohgXEFKrQeKzeBEOY0283X24jCEArCBmb6nsyPc9M0jSgNLet%2BKWQKmNKMswbFb9DZprCY63MfpVFLtFuNoVNrUfoVi5oeCgBqtm92Xmg%2BhifUhCk8Yk%2BYObpxXv7tau%2BPmzdpNLCeThTFsoBECnplVnlIkG%2BQl0a3R4jn3CnfS0owlduaDtHjvXq2jtC%2FLNHtDuxtbDhgUKNjKIwYefHZz8fDLWKBaRSCDhZ4mkt%2B6H6VTKBEC%2BwkYwndcnLB26Vk%2FubKVq%2B4v9eI%2FGMhsID%2BX2o%2FUEsYasmrP3aPf8jFrK9uMfTzLXeES2CN8VIpkg5yZn17WZjjqOIumD0Nps4tVc1FMkBba2kpbAqC%2B8bxors9AA5DEVnbAUypVRewnpCeP9sVKnaitGlbJwqE381LNL2f9XwGrfGt9Dbj5E8g6x2ezk%2Bi7Rsfit%2FYlmfg%3D%3D\" data-target=\"https://pro.oxfordclub.com/m/1356476?rev_campaign_id=613580\" href=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=QYBIGtCUrybhpIX5kL06EYi2xVkmLarFovUrbr%2FDGx1wcUTj8oiOCbRfwvHvHEE7P3qE%2FYw823X06GLf78EaZ7BVvgLZcP65Q8aS%2FTdhw9Iv0nFpKD9JTyn4N1K4CvR3wzzejXl1OhBwOGvQ6h8mTix2WPrGuUyjQzaCDJ7SZSrSRWEmB6bTy2d9N2nmbHKK44%2Bnm1FjusaW9gcrlvn0xXZit0bf6Iw%2FaRBp3UDDkJ3OUw5haFmK6GoPifP%2F7tT6KU8o3fDdrFgif3hyfHLFD4%2BSuo4KkB9NaZj4WFJ9n5A7UBmrGlmj%2Bb5R8yHNIIpRJvr63CiyxD5B6nomVtE2cwEnFkIxwR%2F66w7XPxouyIlR50aK3pljPsvJ4JRU7CfnsTUi7XqTjD0p2%2FPEn5VAQjmzIxWQte33oQs%2FVlh7BmNq9v9fz4wcqGuKpYavNHS%2B88GzpnDT1BZd66gSnqPhSYnZgiFTxGgb%2B0Q6ohUokllJ0fATf6AQ7srTDlP4%2BWEztWomVsK3%2F3jQIRRKyOJBR5%2BmPaptstckYtdQ6FeHBnm4%2BTQTfnVlqRy1FCdbwyaqSbskEit5u%2BjwCsRC6BmZ8eaOohgXEFKrQeKzeBEOY0283X24jCEArCBmb6nsyPc9M0jSgNLet%2BKWQKmNKMswbFb9DZprCY63MfpVFLtFuNoVNrUfoVi5oeCgBqtm92Xmg%2BhifUhCk8Yk%2BYObpxXv7tau%2BPmzdpNLCeThTFsoBECnplVnlIkG%2BQl0a3R4jn3CnfS0owlduaDtHjvXq2jtC%2FLNHtDuxtbDhgUKNjKIwYefHZz8fDLWKBaRSCDhZ4mkt%2B6H6VTKBEC%2BwkYwndcnLB26Vk%2FubKVq%2B4v9eI%2FGMhsID%2BX2o%2FUEsYasmrP3aPf8jFrK9uMfTzLXeES2CN8VIpkg5yZn17WZjjqOIumD0Nps4tVc1FMkBba2kpbAqC%2B8bxors9AA5DEVnbAUypVRewnpCeP9sVKnaitGlbJwqE381LNL2f9XwGrfGt9Dbj5E8g6x2ezk%2Bi7Rsfit%2FYlmfg%3D%3D&s2s=1\"><figure><video src=\"https://videos.revcontent.com/revcontent/video/upload/c_pad,h_240,w_426,b_blurred:400,f_mp4/v1579628040/revcontent-p0/cr_videos/9597/4213758.mp4\"> </video></figure></a></p>",

                "text": "Fox News host Shepard Smith made waves Monday afternoon when he immediately cut off a French media analyst and former elected official who came on his show in the wake of the fire at the Notre Dame Cathedral.\nThe guest explained to Smith that churches are \u201cdesecrated each and every week in France, all over France.\u201d There is plentiful evidence to back up his statement.\n\u201cSir, sir, sir, we\u2019re not going to speculate here of the cause of something which we don\u2019t know,\u201d Smith interjected. \u201cIf you have observations or you know something, we would love to hear it.\u201d\nFollowing the French commentator\u2019s insistence that viewers \u201cneed to be ready\u201d for the possibility of unsavory news, Smith again cut off his guest, exclaiming:\n\u201cNo, sir, we\u2019re not doing that here, not now, not on my watch.\u201d\nChurches are regularly targeted throughout France. Last year, some 875 churches in the country were vandalized, which include regular acts of arson and desecration, according to French police figures reported by The Sun.\nOfficials have not determined the cause of the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. Paris Prosecutor Remy Heitz suspected Tuesday that the fire was likely an accident, but there was no evidence to determine anything just yet. He added that a team of 50 people were investigating the cause of the blaze, according to Reuters.\nFor the past few years, Smith has regularly peddled Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theories on his Fox News show.\nIn July 2017, Smith described the White House\u2019s actions related to the Mueller probe as \u201cdeception\u201d and \u201cmind-blogging.\u201d\n\u201cWhy all these lies? \u2026 Why is it lie after lie after lie,\u201d Smith added.\nIn February 2018, he castigated the president for describing the Russia hoax accurately. Smith took to the airwaves to declare the investigation \u201cthe opposite of a hoax.\u201d\nAs evidence for his Trump-Russia conspiracies, Smith attempts to point to apparent evidence of wrongdoing by calling out the president for not personally insulting Russian President Vladimir Putin to his satisfaction.\n\u201cShameful, disgraceful, treasonous: Three of the descriptions of what President Donald Trump did today in Helsinki,\u201d Smith, who posits himself as an objective journalist, commented in response to the president\u2019s July 2018 meeting with Putin. \u201cPresident Trump declined to stand up for his own people and instead embraced Vladimir Putin,\u201d Smith added.\nThe Fox host has also regularly dismissed the mountains of evidence that Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, among other Trump-tied individuals, were set up by the FBI and other elements of the Obama Intelligence Community.\nAs we now know, thanks to a four-page summary of the Robert Mueller report that is due out Thursday, there was never any Trump-Russia collusion or criminal deception in the form of obstruction.\nSmith has never apologized for promulgating the debunked Russia collusion hoax since the beginning of the Trump presidency. And given his smug and dismissive attitude concerning the ongoing arson epidemic against churches in France, we shouldn\u2019t hold our breath expecting an apology in this case anytime soon.\nSign up to get The Dossier in your inbox twice a week.",

Even though you&rsquo;re up for reelection, you have no power, but I am the final say on all matters, even though I am unelected. I can disobey higher courts but you can&rsquo;t push back even against a lower court. If you don&rsquo;t like it, then you are a member of the KKK.</p>\n<p>Who am I?</p>\n<p>Well, a federal judge, of course.</p>\n<p>Last week, a radical federal judge went on a tirade against President Trump, ironically, criticizing him for criticizing outlandish rulings by federal judges. Carlton Reeves, an Obama-appointed judge in Mississippi, delivered an unprecedented personal attack on the president. Typically they wait until retirement for such tirades, but Reeves, who has been prone to such tirades in his written opinions, let loose on what he called &ldquo;the great assault on our judiciary.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>His speech delivered last Thursday night at the University of Virginia School of Law, upon receipt of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in Law, was titled &ldquo;Defending the Judiciary: A Call for Justice, Truth, and Diversity on the Bench,&rdquo; according to a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/federal-judge-carlton-reeves-trump-kkk-segregationists\">copy obtained by Buzzfeed</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When politicians attack courts as &lsquo;dangerous,&rsquo; &lsquo;political,&rsquo; and guilty of &lsquo;egregious overreach,&rsquo; you can hear the Klan&rsquo;s lawyers, assailing officers of the court across the South. When leaders chastise people for merely &lsquo;us[ing] the courts,&rsquo; you can hear the Citizens Council, hammering up the names of black petitioners in Yazoo City, [Mississippi],&rdquo; thundered Reeves.</p>\n<p>Evidently, he believes that a president who will stand for reelection cannot criticize the decisions of the unelected branch, but he, who will never face voters, can say what he wants. In a further twisted stroke of irony about not criticizing judges, Reeves blasted Trump&rsquo;s judicial picks for being white and not sufficiently and emphatically declaring their support for judicial precedents he agrees with.</p>\n<p>The irony would be laughable if not for the fact that this dangerous individual still sits on a federal court. This is a man who is regularly reversed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for violating Supreme Court precedent, yet somehow, he is concerned about precedent. Reeves was recently overturned by the Fifth Circuit after he said that <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/news/abortion-funding-not-religious-liberty-is-a-fundamental-right/\">Mississippi could not protect business owners</a> from being forced to violate their conscience in serving gay weddings or transgender events. <a href=\"https://mississippitoday.org/2018/01/08/supreme-court-denies-hb-1523-appeal/\">The Supreme Court sided with the Fifth Circuit</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When the powerful accuse courts of &lsquo;open[ing] up our country to potential terrorists,&rsquo; you can hear the Southern Manifesto&rsquo;s authors, smearing the judiciary for simply upholding the rights of black folk,&rdquo; accused Reeves. Presumably, he is referring to Trump and the travel ban. But once again, the Supreme Court actually upheld that move categorically and said the president had complete power to do so. Clearly, Reeves doesn&rsquo;t believe in Supreme Court opinions he disagrees with and will continue to disobey them. Yet, he has the nerve to criticize the leader of a separate branch of government who is not bound by those rulings as a political rule the same way that he is?</p>\n<p>Then again, he clearly has no respect for the Supreme Court either. In a veiled shot at Supreme Court Justice John Roberts, he said, &ldquo;It is not enough for judges, seeing race-based attacks on their brethren, to say they are merely &lsquo;disheartened,&rsquo; or to simply affirm their nonpartisan status.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For those who are unaware of how radical so many of these lower court judges have become, the comments of Reeves should offer a glimpse into their worldview. They believe that we have one branch of government that controls everything, and you are not even allowed to criticize them as a separate branch of government, much less push back against their rulings. Yet, in the ultimate display of intellectual gymnastics, they believe the Supreme Court is only binding when they agree with its decisions. And even though, in their warped view, other branches can&rsquo;t push back, liberal lower court justices can push back when they disagree. This is their one-directional ratchet whereby lower courts can always be &lsquo;more progressive&rsquo; than the Supreme Court but not less so.</p>\n<p>If you think that lower courts will accept Supreme Court rulings they disagree with, let this speech from Reeves be a warning.</p>\n<p>Reeves also said, &ldquo;When lawmakers say &lsquo;we should get rid of judges,&rsquo; you can hear segregationist senators, writing bills to strip courts of their power.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Thus, he is <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/news/10-ways-reclaim-stolen-power-courts/\">comparing a power vested in Congress</a> in Article III Section 2 to make regulations and exceptions to the jurisdiction of the courts to the KKK.</p>\n<p>Reeves believes that anyone who disagrees with him is assaulting the Constitution, but he doesn&rsquo;t believe in the constitutional constraints and checks on his ability to implement his world view unilaterally.</p>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5836478/4-11-19-Judge-Reeves-Speech.pdf\">entire speech</a> for yourself and ask yourself the following question: Are you prepared to submit yourself to hundreds of these radical judges having the sole and final say over every aspect of our society? Remember that Bernie Sanders, Ilhan Omar, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez have almost no power to implement their ideas. But under this unconstitutional practice of judicial supremacy &mdash; especially lower court, one-directional ratchet supremacy &mdash; a number of people who quite openly share their views now have enough power to single-handedly create open borders for our entire nation.</p>\n<p>The tragic irony of this entire speech is that Reeves was receiving a Thomas Jefferson reward. Perhaps Reeves should educate himself on Jefferson. The great founder <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/98-01-02-0734\">once said</a>, &ldquo;[e]ach of the three departments has equally the right to decide for itself what is its duty under the constitution, without regard to what the others may have decided for themselves under a similar question.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Thomas Jefferson, as president, refused to enforce the Sedition Act of 1798, which made it a felony to &ldquo;print, utter, or publish &hellip; any false, scandalous, and malicious writing&rdquo; about the government. Writing in an <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/99-01-02-0348\">1804 letter to Abigail Adams</a>, Jefferson explained his constitutional role as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The judges, believing the law constitutional, had a right to pass a sentence of fine and imprisonment; because that power was placed in their hands by the constitution. but the Executive, believing the law to be unconstitutional, was bound to remit the execution of it; because that power has been confided to him by the constitution.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is what Jefferson thought of judges enforcing laws duly passed by Congress he deemed unconstitutional. One can imagine what he would have thought of edicts &ldquo;passed&rdquo; by judges to nullify the immigration, marriage, and life protection laws duly passed by Congress or a legislature, and the inherent obligation of the executive to defend the constitutional law from the unconstitutional judicial edict.</p>\n<p>Reeves seems to invoke &ldquo;equality&rdquo; in every other sentence to justify his racial litmus test for appointing judges. He should therefore be well acquainted with the speeches of the great fighter for making the Declaration of Independence&rsquo;s ideal of equality a reality during the Civil War. As Abraham Lincoln said of the false notion of judicial supremacy during his debate with Stephen Douglas when Douglass was suggesting the Dred Scott decision locked up freedom in the territories, it&rsquo;s a case of &ldquo;thus saith the Lord:&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote><p>This man sticks to a decision which forbids the people of a Territory from excluding slavery, and he does so not because he says it is right in itself-he does not give any opinion on that-but because it has been <em>decided by the court</em>, and being decided by court, he is, and you are bound to take it in your political action as <em>law</em>-not that he judges at all of its merits, but because a decision of the court is to him a &ldquo;<em>Thus saith the Lord</em>.&rdquo; [Applause.] He places it on that ground alone, and you will bear in mind that, thus committing himself unreservedly to this decision, <em>commits him to the next one</em> just as firmly as to this. He did not commit himself on account of the merit or demerit of the decision, but it is a <em>Thus saith the Lord</em>. The next decision, as much as this, will be a <em>Thus saith the Lord</em>. There is nothing that can divert or turn him away from this decision. [<u>First Debate Ottwa Illinois, August 21, 1858]</u></p></blockquote>\n<p>Mind you, he was referring to the Supreme Court. Nobody until this generation could have imagined we would lock up our border control, election law, life, marriage, and oil because of an insidiously forum-shopped district judge.</p>\n<p>Reeves closed his screed by noting that &ldquo;We do Jefferson justice &ndash;we do the martyrs of Mississippi justice &ndash;we do our country justice&ndash;by defending our judiciary. Now, more than ever.&rdquo; One could not possibly be more historically or constitutionally illiterate than Reeves by making this remark. <a href=\"https://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/founders/default.xqy?keys=FOEA-print-04-02-02-3373\">Jefferson lamented in 1823</a> that &ldquo;there is no danger I apprehend so much as the consolidation of our government by the noiseless, and therefore unalarming, instrumentality of the Supreme Court.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Even Jefferson could never have imagined several hundred lower court judges like Reeves who would wield such power to &ldquo;twist and shape&rdquo; the Constitution &ldquo;into any form they may please&rdquo; like he feared with the Supreme Court. Are we really prepared to surrender our Constitution to men like this, thereby making our republic a government of [unelected] men rather than one of laws?</p>\n<p><strong>Want to keep up with what&rsquo;s going on in Washington without the liberal media slant, establishment spin, and politician-ese?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up to get CRTV&rsquo;s Capitol Hill Brief in your inbox every evening!

                "text": "You cannot criticize me ever, but I can criticize you. Even though you\u2019re up for reelection, you have no power, but I am the final say on all matters, even though I am unelected. I can disobey higher courts but you can\u2019t push back even against a lower court. If you don\u2019t like it, then you are a member of the KKK.\nWho am I?\nWell, a federal judge, of course.\nLast week, a radical federal judge went on a tirade against President Trump, ironically, criticizing him for criticizing outlandish rulings by federal judges. Carlton Reeves, an Obama-appointed judge in Mississippi, delivered an unprecedented personal attack on the president. Typically they wait until retirement for such tirades, but Reeves, who has been prone to such tirades in his written opinions, let loose on what he called \u201cthe great assault on our judiciary.\u201d\nHis speech delivered last Thursday night at the University of Virginia School of Law, upon receipt of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in Law, was titled \u201cDefending the Judiciary: A Call for Justice, Truth, and Diversity on the Bench,\u201d according to a copy obtained by Buzzfeed.\n\u201cWhen politicians attack courts as \u2018dangerous,\u2019 \u2018political,\u2019 and guilty of \u2018egregious overreach,\u2019 you can hear the Klan\u2019s lawyers, assailing officers of the court across the South. When leaders chastise people for merely \u2018us[ing] the courts,\u2019 you can hear the Citizens Council, hammering up the names of black petitioners in Yazoo City, [Mississippi],\u201d thundered Reeves.\nEvidently, he believes that a president who will stand for reelection cannot criticize the decisions of the unelected branch, but he, who will never face voters, can say what he wants. In a further twisted stroke of irony about not criticizing judges, Reeves blasted Trump\u2019s judicial picks for being white and not sufficiently and emphatically declaring their support for judicial precedents he agrees with.\nThe irony would be laughable if not for the fact that this dangerous individual still sits on a federal court. This is a man who is regularly reversed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for violating Supreme Court precedent, yet somehow, he is concerned about precedent. Reeves was recently overturned by the Fifth Circuit after he said that Mississippi could not protect business owners from being forced to violate their conscience in serving gay weddings or transgender events. The Supreme Court sided with the Fifth Circuit.\n\u201cWhen the powerful accuse courts of \u2018open[ing] up our country to potential terrorists,\u2019 you can hear the Southern Manifesto\u2019s authors, smearing the judiciary for simply upholding the rights of black folk,\u201d accused Reeves. Presumably, he is referring to Trump and the travel ban. But once again, the Supreme Court actually upheld that move categorically and said the president had complete power to do so. Clearly, Reeves doesn\u2019t believe in Supreme Court opinions he disagrees with and will continue to disobey them. Yet, he has the nerve to criticize the leader of a separate branch of government who is not bound by those rulings as a political rule the same way that he is?\nThen again, he clearly has no respect for the Supreme Court either. In a veiled shot at Supreme Court Justice John Roberts, he said, \u201cIt is not enough for judges, seeing race-based attacks on their brethren, to say they are merely \u2018disheartened,\u2019 or to simply affirm their nonpartisan status.\u201d\nFor those who are unaware of how radical so many of these lower court judges have become, the comments of Reeves should offer a glimpse into their worldview. They believe that we have one branch of government that controls everything, and you are not even allowed to criticize them as a separate branch of government, much less push back against their rulings. Yet, in the ultimate display of intellectual gymnastics, they believe the Supreme Court is only binding when they agree with its decisions. And even though, in their warped view, other branches can\u2019t push back, liberal lower court justices can push back when they disagree. This is their one-directional ratchet whereby lower courts can always be \u2018more progressive\u2019 than the Supreme Court but not less so.\nIf you think that lower courts will accept Supreme Court rulings they disagree with, let this speech from Reeves be a warning.\nReeves also said, \u201cWhen lawmakers say \u2018we should get rid of judges,\u2019 you can hear segregationist senators, writing bills to strip courts of their power.\u201d\nThus, he is comparing a power vested in Congress in Article III Section 2 to make regulations and exceptions to the jurisdiction of the courts to the KKK.\nReeves believes that anyone who disagrees with him is assaulting the Constitution, but he doesn\u2019t believe in the constitutional constraints and checks on his ability to implement his world view unilaterally.\nRead the entire speech for yourself and ask yourself the following question: Are you prepared to submit yourself to hundreds of these radical judges having the sole and final say over every aspect of our society? Remember that Bernie Sanders, Ilhan Omar, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez have almost no power to implement their ideas. But under this unconstitutional practice of judicial supremacy \u2014 especially lower court, one-directional ratchet supremacy \u2014 a number of people who quite openly share their views now have enough power to single-handedly create open borders for our entire nation.\nThe tragic irony of this entire speech is that Reeves was receiving a Thomas Jefferson reward. Perhaps Reeves should educate himself on Jefferson. The great founder once said, \u201c[e]ach of the three departments has equally the right to decide for itself what is its duty under the constitution, without regard to what the others may have decided for themselves under a similar question.\u201d\nThomas Jefferson, as president, refused to enforce the Sedition Act of 1798, which made it a felony to \u201cprint, utter, or publish \u2026 any false, scandalous, and malicious writing\u201d about the government. Writing in an 1804 letter to Abigail Adams, Jefferson explained his constitutional role as follows:\nThe judges, believing the law constitutional, had a right to pass a sentence of fine and imprisonment; because that power was placed in their hands by the constitution. but the Executive, believing the law to be unconstitutional, was bound to remit the execution of it; because that power has been confided to him by the constitution.\nThis is what Jefferson thought of judges enforcing laws duly passed by Congress he deemed unconstitutional. One can imagine what he would have thought of edicts \u201cpassed\u201d by judges to nullify the immigration, marriage, and life protection laws duly passed by Congress or a legislature, and the inherent obligation of the executive to defend the constitutional law from the unconstitutional judicial edict.\nReeves seems to invoke \u201cequality\u201d in every other sentence to justify his racial litmus test for appointing judges. He should therefore be well acquainted with the speeches of the great fighter for making the Declaration of Independence\u2019s ideal of equality a reality during the Civil War. As Abraham Lincoln said of the false notion of judicial supremacy during his debate with Stephen Douglas when Douglass was suggesting the Dred Scott decision locked up freedom in the territories, it\u2019s a case of \u201cthus saith the Lord:\u201d\nThis man sticks to a decision which forbids the people of a Territory from excluding slavery, and he does so not because he says it is right in itself-he does not give any opinion on that-but because it has been decided by the court, and being decided by court, he is, and you are bound to take it in your political action as law-not that he judges at all of its merits, but because a decision of the court is to him a \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d [Applause.] He places it on that ground alone, and you will bear in mind that, thus committing himself unreservedly to this decision, commits him to the next one just as firmly as to this. He did not commit himself on account of the merit or demerit of the decision, but it is a Thus saith the Lord. The next decision, as much as this, will be a Thus saith the Lord. There is nothing that can divert or turn him away from this decision. [First Debate Ottwa Illinois, August 21, 1858]\nMind you, he was referring to the Supreme Court. Nobody until this generation could have imagined we would lock up our border control, election law, life, marriage, and oil because of an insidiously forum-shopped district judge.\nReeves closed his screed by noting that \u201cWe do Jefferson justice \u2013we do the martyrs of Mississippi justice \u2013we do our country justice\u2013by defending our judiciary. Now, more than ever.\u201d One could not possibly be more historically or constitutionally illiterate than Reeves by making this remark. Jefferson lamented in 1823 that \u201cthere is no danger I apprehend so much as the consolidation of our government by the noiseless, and therefore unalarming, instrumentality of the Supreme Court.\u201d\nEven Jefferson could never have imagined several hundred lower court judges like Reeves who would wield such power to \u201ctwist and shape\u201d the Constitution \u201cinto any form they may please\u201d like he feared with the Supreme Court. Are we really prepared to surrender our Constitution to men like this, thereby making our republic a government of [unelected] men rather than one of laws?\nWant to keep up with what\u2019s going on in Washington without the liberal media slant, establishment spin, and politician-ese?\nSign up to get CRTV\u2019s Capitol Hill Brief in your inbox every evening!

Millions of citizens have left the country, and those who have remained have lost considerable weight and have inadequate access to food and medicine. Hyperinflation continues unabated, and, with the Trump administration recently leveling sanctions against the Venezuelan state oil company (PDVSA), the crisis is only intensifying.</p>\n<p>Yet, although the U.S. &ndash; through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) &ndash; has flown food and medicinal provisions such as high-energy biscuits to the Colombian border with Venezuela, the Venezuelan government is refusing to allow these supplies into the country. Amid the crisis, this might appear to onlookers as gravely inconsiderate and deliberately cruel, at best.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Venezuelan opposition led by Juan Guaid&oacute; has proclaimed that it will somehow retrieve these supplies and bring them into the country on Saturday, February 23. It is not yet clear how the opposition intends to do this. However, one thing is certain: these efforts are going to result in a high-level confrontation between opposition activists and Venezuelan military members, who the Maduro government has ordered to prohibit these supplies from entering the country. In the lead-up to this confrontation, the Trump administration has warned Maduro and his military not to harm protestors and activists. This call, of course, exists alongside Trump&rsquo;s warning that all options, including a military invasion, are on the table.</p>\n<p>Why, amid the crisis, would the Venezuelan government refuse to accept U.S. provisions?</p>\n<p>First, the optics of the U.S. providing supplies to Venezuela legitimates the U.S. as a benevolent actor. The Venezuelan government &ndash; among many others &ndash; have drawn attention to the fact that the U.S. has continued to enact sanctions against the Venezuelan government, exacerbating the economic crisis. This isn&rsquo;t to suggest that the U.S. <em>created </em>the economic crisis. Indeed, the economic crisis long precedes U.S. sanctions. However, there is no doubt that sanctions have, and will continue to have, a deleterious effect on the Venezuelan economy and hammer poor populations more than anyone else &ndash; and certainly more so than the Venezuelan state and military elite that these sanctions are allegedly designed to damage.</p>\n<p>Much of the economic crisis stems from plummeting oil prices and oil production in Venezuela, that is, alongside massive corruption. As a result of plummeting prices and production, the Venezuelan government does not have the foreign currency that exporters demand when sending products, whatever they may be, into the country. The Venezuelan currency is in no way a stable currency, and it is essentially worthless outside of Venezuela. There is subsequently no incentive for exporters to accept Venezuelan bol&iacute;vares. This is indeed a global dynamic that goes beyond Venezuelan currency, as U.S. dollars and Euros serve as global <em>de facto </em>currency, and it demonstrates the consequentiality of a state&rsquo;s possession of such foreign exchange.</p>\n<p>Without the dollars and Euros obtained through oil sales, the Venezuelan government cannot nearly import all the products &ndash; food, medicine, and otherwise &ndash; that Venezuelans require to live a healthy and dignified life. U.S. oil sanctions are specifically designed to deprive the Venezuelan government of economic resources, and, since the government is the primary entity that distributes foreign currency to importers, this results in less foreign currency for importers to bring in goods and thus results in more shortages.</p>\n<p>From the Venezuelan government&rsquo;s perspective, the U.S. is deliberately inducing economic pain in order to push Venezuelan citizens and the military into rebelling against Maduro. At the same time, though, they are trying to play the role of a beneficent actor by offering supplies to the opposition to distribute to citizens. For the Venezuelan government, among many others that see the obvious publicity stunt the U.S. has sought to generate, these actions are hypocritical and downright insincere. If the U.S. truly wanted to assist Venezuelan citizens, many point out that they should work through international groups, like the Red Cross and United Nations, and eliminate economic sanctions. Indeed, this is precisely why the Red Cross, for one, has refused to participate in these U.S. actions, instead criticizing how the U.S. has overtly politicized humanitarian support in order to generate a media spectacle, which now includes a concert sponsored by billionaire Richard Branson on the Colombian-Venezuelan border this weekend.</p>\n<p>Second, the Venezuelan government remains skeptical about USAID activities within the country. For decades, USAID, and its Office for Transition Initiatives (OTI), supplied the opposition with funding and training to defeat the Venezuelan socialists. This included funding and training for opposition students and their organizations, sending NGO representatives critical of the Venezuelan government abroad to drum up international resistance to Venezuelan government policies, and reaching out to Venezuelan government-supporters through neutral-looking, but opposition-led, community groups in an effort to direct them towards opposition political parties.</p>\n<p>For many years, Venezuela benefited from oil production, and thus required little economic assistance from abroad. As a result, USAID has only operated these sorts of political rather than economic development programs in the country. However, it has been reported that even USAID&rsquo;s humanitarian missions have often contained hidden political objectives. For instance, under the guise of an HIV-prevention program in Cuba, USAID operatives sought to find political activists to combat the Cuban government. Indeed, one USAID member called these workshops &ldquo;the perfect excuse&rdquo; to find opposition activists in the country.</p>\n<p>Given both of these dynamics &ndash; U.S. economic sanctions, and USAID&rsquo;s history of political objectives in Venezuela and beyond, Maduro&rsquo;s refusal to allow USAID into the country appears much more rational than it may appear to casual observers at first glance.</p>\n<p>It may surely be the case that members of the U.S. government wish to see Venezuelans garner better access to food and medicine. It may be the case that some even prioritize democracy and human rights above all else, including Venezuelan oil and containment of a decades-long challenge to U.S. supremacy within the hemisphere.</p>\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s also quite clear what the U.S. is trying to do: generate a media spectacle that seemingly reveals President Maduro as a cruel dictator who wishes to starve his own people. In addition, it&rsquo;s also clearly designed to bait the Venezuelan military into turning on Maduro. We can surely debate the cruelty of Maduro&rsquo;s domestic policies and his inability and unwillingness to seriously combat the economic crisis, perhaps in an effort to benefit his cronies. Yet, Maduro is not incorrect about the U.S.&rsquo;s disingenuous behavior.</p>\n<p>At the same time that the U.S. is portraying itself as a literary protagonist with its supplies situated on the Colombia-Venezuela border, its policies are intensifying hardships for Venezuelan citizens. If it truly wanted to help Venezuelans, it could work through international and multilateral institutions to send aid to Venezuela, push for dialogue, and take some options off the table, namely military intervention.</p>\n<p>Above all, the U.S. is currently damaging the Venezuelan economy with its sanctions, and its supplies on the border will do very little to solve the crisis writ large. If sanctions haven&rsquo;t felled governments in Iran or Syria, to name just two examples, it doesn&rsquo;t seem likely that they will fall the Maduro government any time soon. They&rsquo;ll only perpetuate suffering and ultimately generate acrimony towards the country.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Timothy M.

                "text": "There\u2019s no denying that a serious economic and humanitarian crisis faces Venezuela. Millions of citizens have left the country, and those who have remained have lost considerable weight and have inadequate access to food and medicine. Hyperinflation continues unabated, and, with the Trump administration recently leveling sanctions against the Venezuelan state oil company (PDVSA), the crisis is only intensifying.\nYet, although the U.S. \u2013 through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) \u2013 has flown food and medicinal provisions such as high-energy biscuits to the Colombian border with Venezuela, the Venezuelan government is refusing to allow these supplies into the country. Amid the crisis, this might appear to onlookers as gravely inconsiderate and deliberately cruel, at best.\nAs a result, the Venezuelan opposition led by Juan Guaid\u00f3 has proclaimed that it will somehow retrieve these supplies and bring them into the country on Saturday, February 23. It is not yet clear how the opposition intends to do this. However, one thing is certain: these efforts are going to result in a high-level confrontation between opposition activists and Venezuelan military members, who the Maduro government has ordered to prohibit these supplies from entering the country. In the lead-up to this confrontation, the Trump administration has warned Maduro and his military not to harm protestors and activists. This call, of course, exists alongside Trump\u2019s warning that all options, including a military invasion, are on the table.\nWhy, amid the crisis, would the Venezuelan government refuse to accept U.S. provisions?\nFirst, the optics of the U.S. providing supplies to Venezuela legitimates the U.S. as a benevolent actor. The Venezuelan government \u2013 among many others \u2013 have drawn attention to the fact that the U.S. has continued to enact sanctions against the Venezuelan government, exacerbating the economic crisis. This isn\u2019t to suggest that the U.S. created the economic crisis. Indeed, the economic crisis long precedes U.S. sanctions. However, there is no doubt that sanctions have, and will continue to have, a deleterious effect on the Venezuelan economy and hammer poor populations more than anyone else \u2013 and certainly more so than the Venezuelan state and military elite that these sanctions are allegedly designed to damage.\nMuch of the economic crisis stems from plummeting oil prices and oil production in Venezuela, that is, alongside massive corruption. As a result of plummeting prices and production, the Venezuelan government does not have the foreign currency that exporters demand when sending products, whatever they may be, into the country. The Venezuelan currency is in no way a stable currency, and it is essentially worthless outside of Venezuela. There is subsequently no incentive for exporters to accept Venezuelan bol\u00edvares. This is indeed a global dynamic that goes beyond Venezuelan currency, as U.S. dollars and Euros serve as global de facto currency, and it demonstrates the consequentiality of a state\u2019s possession of such foreign exchange.\nWithout the dollars and Euros obtained through oil sales, the Venezuelan government cannot nearly import all the products \u2013 food, medicine, and otherwise \u2013 that Venezuelans require to live a healthy and dignified life. U.S. oil sanctions are specifically designed to deprive the Venezuelan government of economic resources, and, since the government is the primary entity that distributes foreign currency to importers, this results in less foreign currency for importers to bring in goods and thus results in more shortages.\nFrom the Venezuelan government\u2019s perspective, the U.S. is deliberately inducing economic pain in order to push Venezuelan citizens and the military into rebelling against Maduro. At the same time, though, they are trying to play the role of a beneficent actor by offering supplies to the opposition to distribute to citizens. For the Venezuelan government, among many others that see the obvious publicity stunt the U.S. has sought to generate, these actions are hypocritical and downright insincere. If the U.S. truly wanted to assist Venezuelan citizens, many point out that they should work through international groups, like the Red Cross and United Nations, and eliminate economic sanctions. Indeed, this is precisely why the Red Cross, for one, has refused to participate in these U.S. actions, instead criticizing how the U.S. has overtly politicized humanitarian support in order to generate a media spectacle, which now includes a concert sponsored by billionaire Richard Branson on the Colombian-Venezuelan border this weekend.\nSecond, the Venezuelan government remains skeptical about USAID activities within the country. For decades, USAID, and its Office for Transition Initiatives (OTI), supplied the opposition with funding and training to defeat the Venezuelan socialists. This included funding and training for opposition students and their organizations, sending NGO representatives critical of the Venezuelan government abroad to drum up international resistance to Venezuelan government policies, and reaching out to Venezuelan government-supporters through neutral-looking, but opposition-led, community groups in an effort to direct them towards opposition political parties.\nFor many years, Venezuela benefited from oil production, and thus required little economic assistance from abroad. As a result, USAID has only operated these sorts of political rather than economic development programs in the country. However, it has been reported that even USAID\u2019s humanitarian missions have often contained hidden political objectives. For instance, under the guise of an HIV-prevention program in Cuba, USAID operatives sought to find political activists to combat the Cuban government. Indeed, one USAID member called these workshops \u201cthe perfect excuse\u201d to find opposition activists in the country.\nGiven both of these dynamics \u2013 U.S. economic sanctions, and USAID\u2019s history of political objectives in Venezuela and beyond, Maduro\u2019s refusal to allow USAID into the country appears much more rational than it may appear to casual observers at first glance.\nIt may surely be the case that members of the U.S. government wish to see Venezuelans garner better access to food and medicine. It may be the case that some even prioritize democracy and human rights above all else, including Venezuelan oil and containment of a decades-long challenge to U.S. supremacy within the hemisphere.\nHowever, it\u2019s also quite clear what the U.S. is trying to do: generate a media spectacle that seemingly reveals President Maduro as a cruel dictator who wishes to starve his own people. In addition, it\u2019s also clearly designed to bait the Venezuelan military into turning on Maduro. We can surely debate the cruelty of Maduro\u2019s domestic policies and his inability and unwillingness to seriously combat the economic crisis, perhaps in an effort to benefit his cronies. Yet, Maduro is not incorrect about the U.S.\u2019s disingenuous behavior.\nAt the same time that the U.S. is portraying itself as a literary protagonist with its supplies situated on the Colombia-Venezuela border, its policies are intensifying hardships for Venezuelan citizens. If it truly wanted to help Venezuelans, it could work through international and multilateral institutions to send aid to Venezuela, push for dialogue, and take some options off the table, namely military intervention.\nAbove all, the U.S. is currently damaging the Venezuelan economy with its sanctions, and its supplies on the border will do very little to solve the crisis writ large. If sanctions haven\u2019t felled governments in Iran or Syria, to name just two examples, it doesn\u2019t seem likely that they will fall the Maduro government any time soon. They\u2019ll only perpetuate suffering and ultimately generate acrimony towards the country.\nTimothy M.

                "html": "<p>Children&rsquo;s crusades do not necessarily end well. During the years of armed missions to the Holy Land, when Jerusalem meant something to the sacredly inclined in Europe, children were encouraged to take to the rough and dangerous road as it wound its way towards Palestine. In 1212, a boy of 12 is said to have begun preaching at Saint-Denis in France. God had supposedly taken some time to communicate a pressing wish: Christian children were to head to the Holy Land and liberate it from the Infidel. How they would do so was not clear.</p>\n<p>They subsequently starved, suffered deprivation, were killed and enslaved on route to their destination. The modern student movement against climate change stresses another Jerusalem, that there will be nothing to salvage if nothing is done now. We are all, in short, for the chop if climate change is not arrested. As an Oakland high-schooler by the name of Bruke <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/kids-and-teens-strike-against-adults-climate-screw-ups/\">told</a> <em>Wired</em>, &ldquo;My GPA isn&rsquo;t going to matter if I&rsquo;m dead.&rdquo; And much else besides.</p>\n<p>To such movements can also be added other acts of striking in peaceful protest. Tens of thousands of US students did so in 2018 swathed in the grief and despair of gun shootings, the most immediate being the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. The National School Walkout of March 14 and the March for Our Lives ten days later had a biting clarity of purpose: students and staff were entitled to feel secure in the teaching and learning environment. The movement was characterised by much eloquence wreathed in anger and tears, not least of all Emma Gonzalez, who <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/17/us/florida-student-emma-gonzalez-speech/index.html\">chided</a>those political representatives &ldquo;who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been ever done to prevent this&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Criticism of such movements emphasises helplessness and delusion; they are children and so are vulnerable, idiotic and irrelevant. They are to be taught and have nothing to teach the adult world. Leave it to the big boys and girls to stuff up matters. The critics, often estranged from the very political processes they have been complicit in corrupting, see embryos in need of a constructive voice, expressed constructively without inconvenience, not coherent agents keen to affect change. There is, as Kari Marie Norgaard observed in 2012, a lag between the accumulating evidence of doom on the one hand, and the absence of public urgency, even interest, in response. &ldquo;Although not inherently unproblematic,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2012/07/the-everyday-denial-of-climate-change/\">surmised</a> Norgaard, &ldquo;local efforts may provide a key for breaking through climate avoidance from the ground up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The global climate change strike movement by children, blown and swept along by the efforts of Swedish student Greta Thunberg, have suggested the possible short-circuiting of this dilemma: to combat the global by being stridently engaged in the local. (Such statements can become feeble mantras but do operate to galvanise interest.)</p>\n<p>For Thunberg, the issue of change is unavoidable. In her COP24 Climate Change Conference <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1069877730055995392\">speech</a> in December, the plucky youth did not believe that begging world leaders &ldquo;to care for our future&rdquo; would make much of a difference. &ldquo;They have ignored us in the past and they will ignore us again.&rdquo; What mattered was letting &ldquo;them know that change is coming whether they like it or not.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Protests were <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/15/world/climate-strike-students/index.html\">registered</a> on March 15 across 2,052 venues in 123 countries. There were 50 in Australia; and protests in every state in the United States. Often forgotten in these movements is the role played by children themselves in the organisational side of things, often clear, fathomable and inherently coherent. In the United States <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/kids-and-teens-strike-against-adults-climate-screw-ups/\">were</a> such figures as 12-year-old Haven Coleman of Denver, Colorado, Alexandria Villasenor of New York City, and 16-year-old Israr Hirsi of Minnesota.</p>\n<p>Squirrel scholars suggest that these actions represented a &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; at play. Associate lecturer Blanche Verlie <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-terror-of-climate-change-is-transforming-young-peoples-identity-113355\">claimed</a> that her research revealed how &ldquo;young people&rsquo;s sense of self, identity, and existence is being fundamentally altered by climate change.&rdquo; It can be tempting to read too much into matters, to see flowers grow in fields initially thought barren. But there is little doubting climate change as a catalyst of active and noisy encouragement amongst youth, one akin to the anti-war movements of the Vietnam War period.</p>\n<p>There has been much finger wagging against the children from, for instance, politicians who just cannot understand how a striking student could ever get employment. How dare they take time off learning in a classroom while taking to the classroom of the streets? The spokesman for UK Prime Minister Theresa May, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-climate-change-school-pupils-protest-lesson-time-teachers-a8781046.html\">argued</a> that such protests increased &ldquo;teachers&rsquo; workloads&rdquo; and wasted lesson time. Labour&rsquo;s Jeremy Corbyn, in contrast, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1096358314743685120\">signalled</a> his preference for the marchers and strikers: &ldquo;Climate change is the greatest threat that we all face but it is the school kids of today whose futures are most on the line.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In Australia, New South Wales Education Minister Rob Stokes <a href=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6003272207001\">preferred</a> to brandish the rod of punitive action: both students and teachers would be punished for participating in the March 15 rally. By all means, find your &ldquo;voice&rdquo;, suggested the threatening minister, but avoid doing so during school hours. For such scolding types, climate change and injustice have strict timetables and schedules, to be dealt with in good, extra-curricular time.</p>\n<p>Australian Resources Minister Matt Canavan&rsquo;s views on the youth climate action movement are childishly simple and representative, suggesting that Thunberg is correct in her harsh assessment. <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/climate-change-protest-will-lead-to-dole-queue-minister-tells-students-20181130-p50jbt.html\">Recorded</a> in November last year, the minister sees education as an instrumental affair. &ldquo;The best thing you&rsquo;ll learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue. Because that&rsquo;s what your future life will look like [&hellip;] not actually taking charge of your life and getting a real job.&rdquo; Forget the environment&rsquo;s durability; drill it, excavate it, mine it, drain it and burn it to a cinder. Australia, and the world, do not need environmentally conscious citizens, merely automata consuming and feeding the commodity markets. For the likes of Canavan, it is too late. For the children, the battle to change the beastly status quo is urgent, pressing and inevitable.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Binoy Kampmark</strong> was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.

                "text": "Children\u2019s crusades do not necessarily end well. During the years of armed missions to the Holy Land, when Jerusalem meant something to the sacredly inclined in Europe, children were encouraged to take to the rough and dangerous road as it wound its way towards Palestine. In 1212, a boy of 12 is said to have begun preaching at Saint-Denis in France. God had supposedly taken some time to communicate a pressing wish: Christian children were to head to the Holy Land and liberate it from the Infidel. How they would do so was not clear.\nThey subsequently starved, suffered deprivation, were killed and enslaved on route to their destination. The modern student movement against climate change stresses another Jerusalem, that there will be nothing to salvage if nothing is done now. We are all, in short, for the chop if climate change is not arrested. As an Oakland high-schooler by the name of Bruke told Wired, \u201cMy GPA isn\u2019t going to matter if I\u2019m dead.\u201d And much else besides.\nTo such movements can also be added other acts of striking in peaceful protest. Tens of thousands of US students did so in 2018 swathed in the grief and despair of gun shootings, the most immediate being the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. The National School Walkout of March 14 and the March for Our Lives ten days later had a biting clarity of purpose: students and staff were entitled to feel secure in the teaching and learning environment. The movement was characterised by much eloquence wreathed in anger and tears, not least of all Emma Gonzalez, who chidedthose political representatives \u201cwho sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been ever done to prevent this\u201d.\nCriticism of such movements emphasises helplessness and delusion; they are children and so are vulnerable, idiotic and irrelevant. They are to be taught and have nothing to teach the adult world. Leave it to the big boys and girls to stuff up matters. The critics, often estranged from the very political processes they have been complicit in corrupting, see embryos in need of a constructive voice, expressed constructively without inconvenience, not coherent agents keen to affect change. There is, as Kari Marie Norgaard observed in 2012, a lag between the accumulating evidence of doom on the one hand, and the absence of public urgency, even interest, in response. \u201cAlthough not inherently unproblematic,\u201d surmised Norgaard, \u201clocal efforts may provide a key for breaking through climate avoidance from the ground up.\u201d\nThe global climate change strike movement by children, blown and swept along by the efforts of Swedish student Greta Thunberg, have suggested the possible short-circuiting of this dilemma: to combat the global by being stridently engaged in the local. (Such statements can become feeble mantras but do operate to galvanise interest.)\nFor Thunberg, the issue of change is unavoidable. In her COP24 Climate Change Conference speech in December, the plucky youth did not believe that begging world leaders \u201cto care for our future\u201d would make much of a difference. \u201cThey have ignored us in the past and they will ignore us again.\u201d What mattered was letting \u201cthem know that change is coming whether they like it or not.\u201d\nProtests were registered on March 15 across 2,052 venues in 123 countries. There were 50 in Australia; and protests in every state in the United States. Often forgotten in these movements is the role played by children themselves in the organisational side of things, often clear, fathomable and inherently coherent. In the United States were such figures as 12-year-old Haven Coleman of Denver, Colorado, Alexandria Villasenor of New York City, and 16-year-old Israr Hirsi of Minnesota.\nSquirrel scholars suggest that these actions represented a \u201ctransformation\u201d at play. Associate lecturer Blanche Verlie claimed that her research revealed how \u201cyoung people\u2019s sense of self, identity, and existence is being fundamentally altered by climate change.\u201d It can be tempting to read too much into matters, to see flowers grow in fields initially thought barren. But there is little doubting climate change as a catalyst of active and noisy encouragement amongst youth, one akin to the anti-war movements of the Vietnam War period.\nThere has been much finger wagging against the children from, for instance, politicians who just cannot understand how a striking student could ever get employment. How dare they take time off learning in a classroom while taking to the classroom of the streets? The spokesman for UK Prime Minister Theresa May, for instance, argued that such protests increased \u201cteachers\u2019 workloads\u201d and wasted lesson time. Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, in contrast, signalled his preference for the marchers and strikers: \u201cClimate change is the greatest threat that we all face but it is the school kids of today whose futures are most on the line.\u201d\nIn Australia, New South Wales Education Minister Rob Stokes preferred to brandish the rod of punitive action: both students and teachers would be punished for participating in the March 15 rally. By all means, find your \u201cvoice\u201d, suggested the threatening minister, but avoid doing so during school hours. For such scolding types, climate change and injustice have strict timetables and schedules, to be dealt with in good, extra-curricular time.\nAustralian Resources Minister Matt Canavan\u2019s views on the youth climate action movement are childishly simple and representative, suggesting that Thunberg is correct in her harsh assessment. Recorded in November last year, the minister sees education as an instrumental affair. \u201cThe best thing you\u2019ll learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue. Because that\u2019s what your future life will look like [\u2026] not actually taking charge of your life and getting a real job.\u201d Forget the environment\u2019s durability; drill it, excavate it, mine it, drain it and burn it to a cinder. Australia, and the world, do not need environmentally conscious citizens, merely automata consuming and feeding the commodity markets. For the likes of Canavan, it is too late. For the children, the battle to change the beastly status quo is urgent, pressing and inevitable.\nBinoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.

The U.S. record of implacable hostility features terror attacks, military invasion, germ warfare, internal subversion, and almost 60 years of U.S. economic blockade. Devoid of natural resources ready for U.S. plunder, Cuba offends by having defended socialism and national independence. Now Title III of the U.S. 1996 Helms Burton Act joins an arsenal of weapons employed in what Cubans regard as genocidal aggression.</p>\n<p>Helms Burton is complex but centers on tightening the economic blockade; preparing for a transition government; and by means of Title III, inflicting suffering and destabilization. The latter is taking place now in Venezuela, by other means.</p>\n<p>Title III opens the door for the former owners and the heirs of properties nationalized by Cuba&rsquo;s revolutionary government to bring actions in U.S. courts to gain compensation for what they lost. Persons or companies presently occupying such properties, or profiting from them, and who are located in third countries, would be required by the courts to pay off the aggrieved parties. These live in exile, mainly in the United States. The courts would lack enforcement capabilities.</p>\n<p>In 1966, when the law was introduced, <u><a href=\"https://www.dw.com/es/la-ue-se-rebela-debe-temblar-estados-unidos/a-43846455\">the European Union</a> </u>and other critics insisted that the U.S. government delay implementation of Title III. It did so and for the next 23 years, at six month intervals, the United States did announce one six-month delay after another. But a new era dawned on January 16 when the State Department declared that this time suspended implementation would end at 45 days. Something was up.</p>\n<p>On March 4 the State Department indicated that in 30 more days Title III would be applied to the foreign and Cuban &ldquo;traffickers&rdquo; in nationalized properties. Also Title III would, as of March 19, be extended to 200 Cuban enterprises controlled by Cuban security forces or state agencies, many of them connected with Cuba&rsquo;s tourist industry. The U.S. government in November, 2017 had already put those facilities off limits to U.S. tourists.</p>\n<p>As of early April, international investors, aid agencies, and business-persons active or looking to be active in Cuba will be facing vast uncertainties. The former owners of nationalized properties may be suing them in U.S. courts. Concerned about a slippery slope of U.S. disfavor, they may cease involvement with Cuba. And what with unsettling news, foreign lenders may shy away from possibly risky loans for projects in Cuba.</p>\n<p>Title III promises what Cubans call &ldquo;extraterritorial&rdquo; effects. It further universalizes application of the U.S. blockade which, potentially involving all countries, violates their sovereignty.</p>\n<p>But in a Machiavelliantwist, the State Department will apparently wield the &ldquo;trafficking&rdquo; charge selectively. Cuban analyst Reinaldo Taladrid Herrero <u><a href=\"http://mesaredonda.cubadebate.cu/mesa-redonda/2019/03/05/venezuela-contra-el-imperialismo-y-los-ee-uu-por-dentro-y-hacia-america-latina-video/\">explains:</a></u>&ldquo;The road to Havana passes through Caracas.&rdquo; Specifically, &ldquo;They are going to exempt all businesses of countries allied with the United States, above all Canada and the European countries &hellip;. Implementation will be centered on adversary countries like Russia, China, and Venezuela.&rdquo; <u><a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/opinion/venezuelas-standoff-is-socialist-vs-socialist/92589\">Others</a> </u>share his views.</p>\n<p>Title III violates international law, according to Russia; Cuba solidarity groups <u><a href=\"https://www.plenglish.com/index.php/component/search/?o=rn&id=39518&SEO=u.s.-helms-burton-law-against-cuba-rejected-in-europe\">have protested</a></u>. A few <u><a href=\"http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2019/03/04/asesor-de-seguridad-nacional-confirma-nuevas-sanciones-de-estados-unidos-contra-cuba/#.XIv85E18D3g\">business-oriented U.S.</a> </u>groups oppose Title III out of concern that future U.S. commercial ventures in Cuba would be vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Cuba&rsquo;s government argues that nationalization was and is legal according to international norms and <u><a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1869&context=jil\">court decisions</a> </u>in the United States. Cuba has sought satisfaction from the United States for deaths and destruction due to U.S. assaults. Negotiations taking place briefly during the Obama era looked at balancing Cuba&rsquo;s claims with U.S demands stemming from nationalization.</p>\n<p>Title III means major trouble for Cuba. The government there is presently mounting an effort to bolster the nation&rsquo;s economy. Foreign investors will asume a major role in the project. They would provide <u><a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/opinion/trumps-losing-gamble-on-cuba-could-help-venezuelas-maduro/93104\">$2.5 billion annually</a> </u>toward building or refurbishing Cuban institutions, companies, and infrastructure. But any good will on their part may well evaporate once threats loom as to court actions in the United States.</p>\n<p>The availability to the Cuban people of food, health care, schools, building supplies, medicines, and transportation rests on loans and export income from abroad and on income from joint ventures with foreign entities. By 2014 Cuba needed <u><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-investment/cuba-approves-law-aimed-at-attracting-foreign-investment-idUSBREA2S0EJ20140329\">$2.5 billion</a> </u>annually in direct foreign investment. The fact that food imports alone currently require an annual outlay of <u><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-economy/cuba-releases-agricultural-data-reversing-previous-growth-claim-idUSKCN1LT2LV\">$2 billion</a> </u>suggests that current requirements are greater.</p>\n<p>Title III contains the seeds for havoc in the event that Cuba&rsquo;s government is no more and the United States takes charge. According to Cuba&rsquo;s <u><a href=\"http://en.granma.cu/cuba/2019-03-05/cuban-foreign-ministry-denounces-escalating-us-hostility\">Granma newspaper, </a></u>Cubans &ldquo;would be forced to return, reimburse or pay U.S. claimants for the house in which they live, the area on which their communities are built, the arable land where they cultivate produce, the school where their children are educated, the hospital or polyclinic where they receive medical assistance.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cuban Journalist L&aacute;zaro Barredo, formerly editor of <em>Granma,</em> <u><a href=\"http://www.cubadebate.cu/opinion/2019/03/16/terrorismo-politico/#.XI-65E18D3h\">summarizes</a>: </u>&ldquo;Helms Burton literally has no precedents in the legal history of the United States. [It] constitutes an attack on sovereignty within the international community [and] represents political terrorism.&rdquo; Helms Burton would &ldquo;extend U.S. jurisdiction to other countries in an extraterritorial manner with the perverse intention of frightening, scaring, blackmailing, or dissuading persons interested in investing in Cuba.&rdquo; We see a decision &ldquo;to repossess the island, annex it, and move it toward total subordination to the United States.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This report closes with a condemnation of the generalized cruelty and cynicism that is rooted in the strategic thinking of U.S. power brokers.For example, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, presiding at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on March 7, heard testimony from &ldquo;<u><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nytimes/posts/10151844179844999?comment_id=642916366162588&reply_comment_id=805428979821273&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D\">Cynthia Arnson</a> </u>of the US-funded Wilson Center.&rdquo; She &ldquo;agreed with Rubio that &lsquo;widespread unrest&rsquo; is useful, but cautioned that &hellip; &lsquo;starving people don&rsquo;t get out in the streets.&rsquo;&rdquo; In other words, a little starving is OK, but not too much.</p>\n<p><em><strong>W.T.

                "text": "Embarked upon overthrowing Venezuela\u2019s socialist government, the U.S. government now renews efforts to squash Cuba. The U.S. record of implacable hostility features terror attacks, military invasion, germ warfare, internal subversion, and almost 60 years of U.S. economic blockade. Devoid of natural resources ready for U.S. plunder, Cuba offends by having defended socialism and national independence. Now Title III of the U.S. 1996 Helms Burton Act joins an arsenal of weapons employed in what Cubans regard as genocidal aggression.\nHelms Burton is complex but centers on tightening the economic blockade; preparing for a transition government; and by means of Title III, inflicting suffering and destabilization. The latter is taking place now in Venezuela, by other means.\nTitle III opens the door for the former owners and the heirs of properties nationalized by Cuba\u2019s revolutionary government to bring actions in U.S. courts to gain compensation for what they lost. Persons or companies presently occupying such properties, or profiting from them, and who are located in third countries, would be required by the courts to pay off the aggrieved parties. These live in exile, mainly in the United States. The courts would lack enforcement capabilities.\nIn 1966, when the law was introduced, the European Union and other critics insisted that the U.S. government delay implementation of Title III. It did so and for the next 23 years, at six month intervals, the United States did announce one six-month delay after another. But a new era dawned on January 16 when the State Department declared that this time suspended implementation would end at 45 days. Something was up.\nOn March 4 the State Department indicated that in 30 more days Title III would be applied to the foreign and Cuban \u201ctraffickers\u201d in nationalized properties. Also Title III would, as of March 19, be extended to 200 Cuban enterprises controlled by Cuban security forces or state agencies, many of them connected with Cuba\u2019s tourist industry. The U.S. government in November, 2017 had already put those facilities off limits to U.S. tourists.\nAs of early April, international investors, aid agencies, and business-persons active or looking to be active in Cuba will be facing vast uncertainties. The former owners of nationalized properties may be suing them in U.S. courts. Concerned about a slippery slope of U.S. disfavor, they may cease involvement with Cuba. And what with unsettling news, foreign lenders may shy away from possibly risky loans for projects in Cuba.\nTitle III promises what Cubans call \u201cextraterritorial\u201d effects. It further universalizes application of the U.S. blockade which, potentially involving all countries, violates their sovereignty.\nBut in a Machiavelliantwist, the State Department will apparently wield the \u201ctrafficking\u201d charge selectively. Cuban analyst Reinaldo Taladrid Herrero explains:\u201cThe road to Havana passes through Caracas.\u201d Specifically, \u201cThey are going to exempt all businesses of countries allied with the United States, above all Canada and the European countries \u2026. Implementation will be centered on adversary countries like Russia, China, and Venezuela.\u201d Others share his views.\nTitle III violates international law, according to Russia; Cuba solidarity groups have protested. A few business-oriented U.S. groups oppose Title III out of concern that future U.S. commercial ventures in Cuba would be vulnerable.\nCuba\u2019s government argues that nationalization was and is legal according to international norms and court decisions in the United States. Cuba has sought satisfaction from the United States for deaths and destruction due to U.S. assaults. Negotiations taking place briefly during the Obama era looked at balancing Cuba\u2019s claims with U.S demands stemming from nationalization.\nTitle III means major trouble for Cuba. The government there is presently mounting an effort to bolster the nation\u2019s economy. Foreign investors will asume a major role in the project. They would provide $2.5 billion annually toward building or refurbishing Cuban institutions, companies, and infrastructure. But any good will on their part may well evaporate once threats loom as to court actions in the United States.\nThe availability to the Cuban people of food, health care, schools, building supplies, medicines, and transportation rests on loans and export income from abroad and on income from joint ventures with foreign entities. By 2014 Cuba needed $2.5 billion annually in direct foreign investment. The fact that food imports alone currently require an annual outlay of $2 billion suggests that current requirements are greater.\nTitle III contains the seeds for havoc in the event that Cuba\u2019s government is no more and the United States takes charge. According to Cuba\u2019s Granma newspaper, Cubans \u201cwould be forced to return, reimburse or pay U.S. claimants for the house in which they live, the area on which their communities are built, the arable land where they cultivate produce, the school where their children are educated, the hospital or polyclinic where they receive medical assistance.\u201d\nCuban Journalist L\u00e1zaro Barredo, formerly editor of Granma, summarizes: \u201cHelms Burton literally has no precedents in the legal history of the United States. [It] constitutes an attack on sovereignty within the international community [and] represents political terrorism.\u201d Helms Burton would \u201cextend U.S. jurisdiction to other countries in an extraterritorial manner with the perverse intention of frightening, scaring, blackmailing, or dissuading persons interested in investing in Cuba.\u201d We see a decision \u201cto repossess the island, annex it, and move it toward total subordination to the United States.\u201d\nThis report closes with a condemnation of the generalized cruelty and cynicism that is rooted in the strategic thinking of U.S. power brokers.For example, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, presiding at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on March 7, heard testimony from \u201cCynthia Arnson of the US-funded Wilson Center.\u201d She \u201cagreed with Rubio that \u2018widespread unrest\u2019 is useful, but cautioned that \u2026 \u2018starving people don\u2019t get out in the streets.\u2019\u201d In other words, a little starving is OK, but not too much.\nW.T.

Think these representatives of wealth and war and power went away with the mid-evening swing toward doom of the <em>New York Times </em>polls on election night 2016? Think again&hellip; Hillary Clinton has been supplanted by Joe Biden. Power and wealth will not give up because those forces have an almost psychopathic hold on a wing of the Democratic Party, like an out-of-control vehicle careening to certain doom down a mountainside.</p>\n<p>In the 1970s, Biden was a fierce opponent of school busing toward the end of eliminating segregation in schools (<a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2019/3/13/as_joe_biden_hints_at_presidential\">&rdquo;As Joe Biden Hints at presidential Run, Andrew Cockburn Looks at His &lsquo;Disastrous Legislative Legacy,&rsquo;&rdquo;</a> <em>Democracy Now</em>, March 13, 2019).</p>\n<p>During the 1980s and 1990s, Biden became a law and order legislator, teaming up with none other than Strom Thurmond and Bill Clinton to put people away and fueling the epidemic of mass jailing. Readers know the result that those &ldquo;crime&rdquo; fighting sprees had on the black community.</p>\n<p>Then, during the confirmation process of Clarence Thomas, Biden refused to call witnesses that would have supported Anita Hill&rsquo;s testimony about Thomas.</p>\n<p>Biden made it impossible for students to discharge student debt, a move that saddles students with a lifelong burden of indebtedness as the price of a college or technical education, especially if students have not struck it rich in a global economy.</p>\n<p>Biden loves the banks and credit card companies, many that make their corporate homes in Biden&rsquo;s tax-lenient state of Delaware. And in holding those accountable, who tanked the economy in 2007-2008, Biden let them off on a free ride while ordinary people suffered and the housing debacle exploded.</p>\n<p>In an opinion piece masquerading as fact, the <em>Guardian </em>reports in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/14/joe-biden-2020-elections-run-fundraising-questions?CMP=share_btn_link\">&ldquo;Joe Biden faces tough choices on fundraising for potential 2020 run,&rdquo;</a>(March 14, 2019), that &ldquo;middle-class Joe&rdquo; faces hurdles because of his ties to Wall Street in an increasingly progressive Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>And here&rsquo;s Joe Biden on the war for regime change in Iraq in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/429031-bidens-votes-words-on-iraq-become-hurdle-in-2020\">&ldquo;Biden&rsquo;s votes, words on Iraq become hurdle in 2020,&rdquo; </a>(The <em>Hill, </em>February 8, 2019): &ldquo;Biden backed the resolution giving former President George W. Bush the authority to invade Iraq, and he also praised the president in a Senate floor speech at the time for his handling of the case for war.&rdquo; For decades, Democrats in Congress (and in the presidency) have almost universally supported war and the preparations for war. Whether this policy position changes with the Congressional Progressive Caucus remains to be seen, but the vast majority of Democrats have a really <em>bad</em> record on war. Besides the nationalistic chauvinism involved in war, there is the fealty to war industries among Democrats.</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen if Democrats, and especially the Wall Street and war fans in the Democratic Party can muster anything like the pushback in Congress to Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s immoral and illegal war in Yemen. The history of the two-party duopoly and their ties to the military-industrial-financial complex do not bode well. The Democrats&rsquo; record on war predates the attacks of September 2001.</p>\n<p>With Biden&rsquo;s record on war, integration, &ldquo;crime,&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s right to work unmolested, the Great Recession, and banks and credit card companies, readers might think Joe Biden is a throwback to the worst tendencies of neoliberal Democrats, and they&rsquo;d be right on the money!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Howard Lisnoff</strong> is a freelance writer.

                "text": "Like an annoying rash that could become dangerous, the Wall Street and war wing of the Democratic Party is back for yet another reprise in its run in the 2020 presidential primary and election. Think these representatives of wealth and war and power went away with the mid-evening swing toward doom of the New York Times polls on election night 2016? Think again\u2026 Hillary Clinton has been supplanted by Joe Biden. Power and wealth will not give up because those forces have an almost psychopathic hold on a wing of the Democratic Party, like an out-of-control vehicle careening to certain doom down a mountainside.\nIn the 1970s, Biden was a fierce opponent of school busing toward the end of eliminating segregation in schools (\u201dAs Joe Biden Hints at presidential Run, Andrew Cockburn Looks at His \u2018Disastrous Legislative Legacy,\u2019\u201d Democracy Now, March 13, 2019).\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Biden became a law and order legislator, teaming up with none other than Strom Thurmond and Bill Clinton to put people away and fueling the epidemic of mass jailing. Readers know the result that those \u201ccrime\u201d fighting sprees had on the black community.\nThen, during the confirmation process of Clarence Thomas, Biden refused to call witnesses that would have supported Anita Hill\u2019s testimony about Thomas.\nBiden made it impossible for students to discharge student debt, a move that saddles students with a lifelong burden of indebtedness as the price of a college or technical education, especially if students have not struck it rich in a global economy.\nBiden loves the banks and credit card companies, many that make their corporate homes in Biden\u2019s tax-lenient state of Delaware. And in holding those accountable, who tanked the economy in 2007-2008, Biden let them off on a free ride while ordinary people suffered and the housing debacle exploded.\nIn an opinion piece masquerading as fact, the Guardian reports in \u201cJoe Biden faces tough choices on fundraising for potential 2020 run,\u201d(March 14, 2019), that \u201cmiddle-class Joe\u201d faces hurdles because of his ties to Wall Street in an increasingly progressive Democratic Party.\nAnd here\u2019s Joe Biden on the war for regime change in Iraq in \u201cBiden\u2019s votes, words on Iraq become hurdle in 2020,\u201d (The Hill, February 8, 2019): \u201cBiden backed the resolution giving former President George W. Bush the authority to invade Iraq, and he also praised the president in a Senate floor speech at the time for his handling of the case for war.\u201d For decades, Democrats in Congress (and in the presidency) have almost universally supported war and the preparations for war. Whether this policy position changes with the Congressional Progressive Caucus remains to be seen, but the vast majority of Democrats have a really bad record on war. Besides the nationalistic chauvinism involved in war, there is the fealty to war industries among Democrats.\nIt remains to be seen if Democrats, and especially the Wall Street and war fans in the Democratic Party can muster anything like the pushback in Congress to Saudi Arabia\u2019s immoral and illegal war in Yemen. The history of the two-party duopoly and their ties to the military-industrial-financial complex do not bode well. The Democrats\u2019 record on war predates the attacks of September 2001.\nWith Biden\u2019s record on war, integration, \u201ccrime,\u201d a woman\u2019s right to work unmolested, the Great Recession, and banks and credit card companies, readers might think Joe Biden is a throwback to the worst tendencies of neoliberal Democrats, and they\u2019d be right on the money!\nHoward Lisnoff is a freelance writer.

Ukania&rsquo;s tragedy is that far too many Brits fell for these tales.</p>\n<p>Probably the biggest of these tales concerned the notion of a share-owning democracy.</p>\n<p>The idea here was simple, but utterly misguided &ndash; sell off the publicly-owned enterprises, and everyone will be able to buy shares in the newly privatized companies. By buying however many shares you want, you will become a part of Thatcher&rsquo;s great British share-owning democracy.</p>\n<p>Many of us knew at that time that it was never going to be like this at all. As Marx noted, the stock exchange, where the shares of the newly privatized companies would of course be traded, is &ldquo;where the little fish are swallowed by the sharks and the lambs by the stock-exchange wolves&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The wealthy have always used their resources to acquire a monopoly on company shares. So when the public enterprises were put on sale at rock-bottom prices by Thatcher and her cronies, the wealthy rushed to collar the majority of the share offerings, the ensuing demand drove-up the price of the shares, and in so doing put nearly all of them beyond the reach of Joe and Jill Normal.</p>\n<p>So what actually happened to the &ldquo;great British share-owning democracy&rdquo;?</p>\n<p>The state bureaucrats so excoriated by Thatcher have been replaced by private bureaucrats, albeit ones paid astronomical salaries when compared to those received by their counterparts in the annihilated state sector.</p>\n<p>The newly privatizedstate enterprises were never going to be owned by the likes of Joe and Jill Normal, or even John and Jane Bull&mdash;instead large foreign corporations and foreign governments now own nearly all these companies.</p>\n<p>Indeed the supreme Thatcherite irony is that many of the enterprises privatized by her have now returned to government ownership, but alas for Brits these are foreign governments.</p>\n<p>Take the town of Romford, in the London borough of Havering, which had the distinction of being named as the most Eurosceptic place in the country in a 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/14/romford-aberystwyth-most-eurosceptic-europhiliac-places-uk\">YouGov survey</a>.</p>\n<p>The Brexit motto is &ldquo;take back control&rdquo;, but at Romford station there&rsquo;s a choice of trains into London: you can travel on one run by the Dutch, or one run by the Chinese. Someone going to neighbouring Basildon has to change at Upminster and buy a ticket from the Italian firm that operates C2C. Here&rsquo;s the fuller picture.</p>\n<p>ScotRail is operated by Abellio, which is wholly owned by the Dutch national rail operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen.</p>\n<p>Abellio also owns 60% of Greater Anglia trains (the remaining 40% is owned by the Japanese company Mitsui).</p>\n<p>West Midlands trains is 70% owned by Abellio, the remaining 30% is shared between Mitsui and another Japanese company JR East.</p>\n<p>Arriva Rail London is operated by Arriva, which is owned by the German national rail operator Deutsche Bahn.</p>\n<p>Arriva also operates Chiltern Railways and CrossCountry, Grand Central, and Northern.</p>\n<p>The already-mentioned C2C is owned by the Italian government&rsquo;s Trenitalia.</p>\n<p>Eurostar is operated by EIL, which is owned by the French government&rsquo;s SNCF (55%), Caisse de d&eacute;p&ocirc;t et placement du Qu&eacute;bec (CDPQ) (30%), Hermes Infrastructure (10%) which is majority-owned by a US investment fund, and NMBS/SNCB (5%) which is the state railway company of Belgium.</p>\n<p>The Chinese corporation MTR owns TfL rail and 30% of South Western Railway.</p>\n<p>Transport for Wales is owned by Keolis, a Franco-Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois private operator of public transport.</p>\n<p>In fact, European state railways now own more than quarter of the UK&rsquo;s passenger-train system.</p>\n<p>The same situation exists with regard to the UK&rsquo;s energy, water, and telephone companies.</p>\n<p>London Electricity, SWEB, Seeboard and British Energy are owned by EDF Energy, a subsidiary of the French Government-owned energy company EDF (&Eacute;lectricit&eacute; de France) Group.</p>\n<p>Powergen is owned by the German group E.ON.</p>\n<p>Calortex, Independent Energy and Midlands Electricity are owned by Npower, a subsidiary of German energy company RWE Group.</p>\n<p>ScottishPower is a subsidiary of Spanish company Iberdrola, which also owns Manweb, the energy company supplying Merseyside and North Wales.</p>\n<p>Anglian Water is owned by a consortium consisting of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Colonial First State Global Asset Management (owned by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia), IFM Investors (an Australian investment management firm), and 3i. The same consortium also owns Hartlepool Water.</p>\n<p>Northumbrian Water is owned by Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings (Hong Kong). Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings also owns Essex and Suffolk Water.</p>\n<p>Wessex Water is owned by YTL Corporation (Malaysia)</p>\n<p>Affinity Water is part owned by Morgan Stanley (USA).</p>\n<p>South East Water is owned by Hastings Diversified Utilities Fund/Utilities Trust of Australia.</p>\n<p>Sutton and East Surrey Water is owned by Sumitomo Corporation (Japan).</p>\n<p>Level 3 Communications (USA) owns a national optical fibre network.</p>\n<p>O2 runs a GSM-900 network and is owned by Telef&oacute;nica (Spain).</p>\n<p>EE runs a GSM-1800 network and is a joint venture of Orange (France) and Deutsche Telecom (Germany)</p>\n<p>The UK&rsquo;s bus and airport companies are also largely foreign owned.</p>\n<p>Arriva buses is owned by the German national rail operator Deutsche Bahn.</p>\n<p>Bus and coach companies are also owned by ComfortDelGro (Singapore), RATP (France), and Transdev (France).</p>\n<p>Heathrow, Glasgow, and Southampton airports are owned by the Spanish Ferrovial (25%), Qatar Holding (20%), and Caisse de d&eacute;p&ocirc;t et placement du Qu&eacute;bec (12.62%).</p>\n<p>Gatwick airport is owned by Global Infrastructure Partners (USA).</p>\n<p>The Ontario Teachers&rsquo; Pension Plan owns 48.25% of Birmingham airport.</p>\n<p>IFM Investors (Australia), in addition to part-owning Anglian Water, also owns Manchester airport, the MM6 tollway, and the telecommunications company Arqiva.</p>\n<p>All this has been the consequence of asset-stripping undertaken on a massive scale.</p>\n<p>Assets belonging to the British public were thrown (literally) into the laps of foreign companies and governments.</p>\n<p>London, for most excellent reasons, decided recently against erecting a statue of Margaret Thatcher.</p>\n<p>Given that she was the architect of so much largesse extended to the corporations and governments of other countries, there might be a slightly better chance of having this statue put up in any number of western European cities, as well as those in Japan, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, the US, China, and in Qatar and Singapore.</p>\n<p>The Iron Lady initiated an act of daylight robbery from which the owners of private wealth and the governments of other countries benefitted immensely.</p>\n<p>The British public, which owned these assets, got stiffed.</p>\n<p>All this has taken place in a context where the wealth-gap between the Have-Lots and the JAMs (Just About Managing) has grown to levels not seen since the 1930s.</p>",

                "text": "Margaret Thatcher was very good at telling tall tales. Ukania\u2019s tragedy is that far too many Brits fell for these tales.\nProbably the biggest of these tales concerned the notion of a share-owning democracy.\nThe idea here was simple, but utterly misguided \u2013 sell off the publicly-owned enterprises, and everyone will be able to buy shares in the newly privatized companies. By buying however many shares you want, you will become a part of Thatcher\u2019s great British share-owning democracy.\nMany of us knew at that time that it was never going to be like this at all. As Marx noted, the stock exchange, where the shares of the newly privatized companies would of course be traded, is \u201cwhere the little fish are swallowed by the sharks and the lambs by the stock-exchange wolves\u201d.\nThe wealthy have always used their resources to acquire a monopoly on company shares. So when the public enterprises were put on sale at rock-bottom prices by Thatcher and her cronies, the wealthy rushed to collar the majority of the share offerings, the ensuing demand drove-up the price of the shares, and in so doing put nearly all of them beyond the reach of Joe and Jill Normal.\nSo what actually happened to the \u201cgreat British share-owning democracy\u201d?\nThe state bureaucrats so excoriated by Thatcher have been replaced by private bureaucrats, albeit ones paid astronomical salaries when compared to those received by their counterparts in the annihilated state sector.\nThe newly privatizedstate enterprises were never going to be owned by the likes of Joe and Jill Normal, or even John and Jane Bull\u2014instead large foreign corporations and foreign governments now own nearly all these companies.\nIndeed the supreme Thatcherite irony is that many of the enterprises privatized by her have now returned to government ownership, but alas for Brits these are foreign governments.\nTake the town of Romford, in the London borough of Havering, which had the distinction of being named as the most Eurosceptic place in the country in a 2016 YouGov survey.\nThe Brexit motto is \u201ctake back control\u201d, but at Romford station there\u2019s a choice of trains into London: you can travel on one run by the Dutch, or one run by the Chinese. Someone going to neighbouring Basildon has to change at Upminster and buy a ticket from the Italian firm that operates C2C. Here\u2019s the fuller picture.\nScotRail is operated by Abellio, which is wholly owned by the Dutch national rail operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen.\nAbellio also owns 60% of Greater Anglia trains (the remaining 40% is owned by the Japanese company Mitsui).\nWest Midlands trains is 70% owned by Abellio, the remaining 30% is shared between Mitsui and another Japanese company JR East.\nArriva Rail London is operated by Arriva, which is owned by the German national rail operator Deutsche Bahn.\nArriva also operates Chiltern Railways and CrossCountry, Grand Central, and Northern.\nThe already-mentioned C2C is owned by the Italian government\u2019s Trenitalia.\nEurostar is operated by EIL, which is owned by the French government\u2019s SNCF (55%), Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec (CDPQ) (30%), Hermes Infrastructure (10%) which is majority-owned by a US investment fund, and NMBS/SNCB (5%) which is the state railway company of Belgium.\nThe Chinese corporation MTR owns TfL rail and 30% of South Western Railway.\nTransport for Wales is owned by Keolis, a Franco-Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois private operator of public transport.\nIn fact, European state railways now own more than quarter of the UK\u2019s passenger-train system.\nThe same situation exists with regard to the UK\u2019s energy, water, and telephone companies.\nLondon Electricity, SWEB, Seeboard and British Energy are owned by EDF Energy, a subsidiary of the French Government-owned energy company EDF (\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France) Group.\nPowergen is owned by the German group E.ON.\nCalortex, Independent Energy and Midlands Electricity are owned by Npower, a subsidiary of German energy company RWE Group.\nScottishPower is a subsidiary of Spanish company Iberdrola, which also owns Manweb, the energy company supplying Merseyside and North Wales.\nAnglian Water is owned by a consortium consisting of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Colonial First State Global Asset Management (owned by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia), IFM Investors (an Australian investment management firm), and 3i. The same consortium also owns Hartlepool Water.\nNorthumbrian Water is owned by Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings (Hong Kong). Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings also owns Essex and Suffolk Water.\nWessex Water is owned by YTL Corporation (Malaysia)\nAffinity Water is part owned by Morgan Stanley (USA).\nSouth East Water is owned by Hastings Diversified Utilities Fund/Utilities Trust of Australia.\nSutton and East Surrey Water is owned by Sumitomo Corporation (Japan).\nLevel 3 Communications (USA) owns a national optical fibre network.\nO2 runs a GSM-900 network and is owned by Telef\u00f3nica (Spain).\nEE runs a GSM-1800 network and is a joint venture of Orange (France) and Deutsche Telecom (Germany)\nThe UK\u2019s bus and airport companies are also largely foreign owned.\nArriva buses is owned by the German national rail operator Deutsche Bahn.\nBus and coach companies are also owned by ComfortDelGro (Singapore), RATP (France), and Transdev (France).\nHeathrow, Glasgow, and Southampton airports are owned by the Spanish Ferrovial (25%), Qatar Holding (20%), and Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec (12.62%).\nGatwick airport is owned by Global Infrastructure Partners (USA).\nThe Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan owns 48.25% of Birmingham airport.\nIFM Investors (Australia), in addition to part-owning Anglian Water, also owns Manchester airport, the MM6 tollway, and the telecommunications company Arqiva.\nAll this has been the consequence of asset-stripping undertaken on a massive scale.\nAssets belonging to the British public were thrown (literally) into the laps of foreign companies and governments.\nLondon, for most excellent reasons, decided recently against erecting a statue of Margaret Thatcher.\nGiven that she was the architect of so much largesse extended to the corporations and governments of other countries, there might be a slightly better chance of having this statue put up in any number of western European cities, as well as those in Japan, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, the US, China, and in Qatar and Singapore.\nThe Iron Lady initiated an act of daylight robbery from which the owners of private wealth and the governments of other countries benefitted immensely.\nThe British public, which owned these assets, got stiffed.\nAll this has taken place in a context where the wealth-gap between the Have-Lots and the JAMs (Just About Managing) has grown to levels not seen since the 1930s.",

It&rsquo;s over. And I think our republic is in its last days, because unauthorized disclosures of this kind are the lifeblood of a republic.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>&ndash; </em>Daniel Ellsberg</p></blockquote>\n<p>The persecution and arrest of Julian Assange is the first and most definitive step toward full blown global fascism. The symbolism of a gravely ill journalist being manhandled by uniformed henchmen is the exact imagery it needed to send a chilling message to whistleblowers and the press. The assault and eventual dismantling of what remains of a free press has always been that first step, and it is what lies on the horizon barring mass dissent. For decades the mainstream media has acquiesced to the demands of the corporate world of high finance that now owns them outright and the military and surveillance state that informs their narrative. To be sure, many of them must be trembling at the events that unfolded in London.</p>\n<p>That so many prominent American liberals are cheering this on is hardly surprising. History is replete with examples of how the privileged bourgeoisie are the first to capitulate to fascism. It happened in the 1930&rsquo;s in Germany, Spain and Italy. It happened in the 1970&rsquo;s in Argentina and Chile. It is happening now across the supposedly &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; western world. The animus they possess for Assange is not over his personal ethics, politics or affiliations, which are indeed open for criticism and debate. Like any human being, he is flawed. It is rooted in sore feelings over Wikileaks exposure of the machinations of the corrupt Democratic Party and their Wall Street favoured war hawk, Hillary Clinton. None of what Wikileaks revealed was untrue, but they blame the failure of their deeply flawed candidate on it nonetheless. They care little about the war crimes the platform helped expose through the courage of Chelsea Manning or the threat his persecution represents to press freedom itself.</p>\n<p>That the fascist despot Trump has disavowed Wikileaks is hardly surprising either. After all, he may have used the leaks to his benefit, but the man who has relentlessly demonized the press will undoubtedly use this moment to his benefit again. Wikileaks as an organization isn&rsquo;t perfect and, like any other media outlet, it is not beyond criticism. But nearly every major news outlet has used and published its material, without appreciation or gratitude, because it provided an unprecedented glimpse into the nefarious activities and guiding principles of the ruling elite. The veil had been finally lifted. But with the arrest of Julian Assange this makes all of those news outlets vulnerable to state or corporate repression and censure.</p>\n<p>With the Trump administration chomping at the bit to launch a war against Iran and Venezuela, this must come as welcome news to them. After all, it was Wikileaks that exposed the war crimes of the Bush administration in Iraq, not the corporate media. So they can be assured little reporting, aside from a few courageous citizen journalists or those <em>embedded with the troops</em> who parrot Pentagon talking points, will be done to expose the Empire&rsquo;s war crimes now.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Trump has been given a green light with this one event to continue and expand the American Empire, moribund as it is, without reproach. And like a bloated corpse, it will undoubtedly infect and defile everything it touches. More brutal violations of the global south, more coups against democratically elected governments, and bolder acts of authoritarian cruelty at home. He has made no pretense of this. His minions, Pompeo and Bolton, are working tirelessly constructing the next war. And in the past several weeks he has purged his administration of monsters he deemed &ldquo;too weak&rdquo; when it comes to crackdowns against immigrants and asylum seekers. A classic tactic of all tyrants. He has anointed the rabid white supremacist, Stephen Miller, in this 21<sup>st</sup> century pogrom and has also toyed with the idea of making the military in charge of internment camps for migrants. Only a fool would not find such a thing chilling to the bone.</p>\n<p>Indeed fascist leaders around the world, along with the military/surveillance establishment and their neoliberal enablers, are celebrating the silencing of Assange. After all, Wikileaks has represented a major thorn in their sides for a decade. From Netanyahu to Duterte to Bolsonaro to Modi and even Putin, all will be emboldened to expand their own attacks on press freedom. All of them will feel empowered to be even more unrestrained in their brutality.</p>\n<p>We are on the eve of a sweeping, global, fascist tyranny. Thanks to the continued proliferation of nuclear arms, endless corporate and military assaults on the life sustaining biosphere, catastrophic climate change and the systematic dismantling of democracy, it is a land uncharted. Journalists, especially those who are independent of the corporate stranglehold, are being routinely and relentlessly persecuted and even murdered around the world. They are a bulwark against fascism we dare not lose. But the arrest of Assange is representative of a free press now under constant threat of annihilation. And it will without a doubt grow even more difficult for them to navigate through the mendacity of a ruthless ruling order that has become utterly unrestrained.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Kenn Orphan</strong> is an artist, sociologist, radical nature lover and weary, but committed activist.

                "text": "\u201cThe freedom of the press is not safe. It\u2019s over. And I think our republic is in its last days, because unauthorized disclosures of this kind are the lifeblood of a republic.\u201d\n\u2013 Daniel Ellsberg\nThe persecution and arrest of Julian Assange is the first and most definitive step toward full blown global fascism. The symbolism of a gravely ill journalist being manhandled by uniformed henchmen is the exact imagery it needed to send a chilling message to whistleblowers and the press. The assault and eventual dismantling of what remains of a free press has always been that first step, and it is what lies on the horizon barring mass dissent. For decades the mainstream media has acquiesced to the demands of the corporate world of high finance that now owns them outright and the military and surveillance state that informs their narrative. To be sure, many of them must be trembling at the events that unfolded in London.\nThat so many prominent American liberals are cheering this on is hardly surprising. History is replete with examples of how the privileged bourgeoisie are the first to capitulate to fascism. It happened in the 1930\u2019s in Germany, Spain and Italy. It happened in the 1970\u2019s in Argentina and Chile. It is happening now across the supposedly \u201cdemocratic\u201d western world. The animus they possess for Assange is not over his personal ethics, politics or affiliations, which are indeed open for criticism and debate. Like any human being, he is flawed. It is rooted in sore feelings over Wikileaks exposure of the machinations of the corrupt Democratic Party and their Wall Street favoured war hawk, Hillary Clinton. None of what Wikileaks revealed was untrue, but they blame the failure of their deeply flawed candidate on it nonetheless. They care little about the war crimes the platform helped expose through the courage of Chelsea Manning or the threat his persecution represents to press freedom itself.\nThat the fascist despot Trump has disavowed Wikileaks is hardly surprising either. After all, he may have used the leaks to his benefit, but the man who has relentlessly demonized the press will undoubtedly use this moment to his benefit again. Wikileaks as an organization isn\u2019t perfect and, like any other media outlet, it is not beyond criticism. But nearly every major news outlet has used and published its material, without appreciation or gratitude, because it provided an unprecedented glimpse into the nefarious activities and guiding principles of the ruling elite. The veil had been finally lifted. But with the arrest of Julian Assange this makes all of those news outlets vulnerable to state or corporate repression and censure.\nWith the Trump administration chomping at the bit to launch a war against Iran and Venezuela, this must come as welcome news to them. After all, it was Wikileaks that exposed the war crimes of the Bush administration in Iraq, not the corporate media. So they can be assured little reporting, aside from a few courageous citizen journalists or those embedded with the troops who parrot Pentagon talking points, will be done to expose the Empire\u2019s war crimes now.\nIndeed, Trump has been given a green light with this one event to continue and expand the American Empire, moribund as it is, without reproach. And like a bloated corpse, it will undoubtedly infect and defile everything it touches. More brutal violations of the global south, more coups against democratically elected governments, and bolder acts of authoritarian cruelty at home. He has made no pretense of this. His minions, Pompeo and Bolton, are working tirelessly constructing the next war. And in the past several weeks he has purged his administration of monsters he deemed \u201ctoo weak\u201d when it comes to crackdowns against immigrants and asylum seekers. A classic tactic of all tyrants. He has anointed the rabid white supremacist, Stephen Miller, in this 21st century pogrom and has also toyed with the idea of making the military in charge of internment camps for migrants. Only a fool would not find such a thing chilling to the bone.\nIndeed fascist leaders around the world, along with the military/surveillance establishment and their neoliberal enablers, are celebrating the silencing of Assange. After all, Wikileaks has represented a major thorn in their sides for a decade. From Netanyahu to Duterte to Bolsonaro to Modi and even Putin, all will be emboldened to expand their own attacks on press freedom. All of them will feel empowered to be even more unrestrained in their brutality.\nWe are on the eve of a sweeping, global, fascist tyranny. Thanks to the continued proliferation of nuclear arms, endless corporate and military assaults on the life sustaining biosphere, catastrophic climate change and the systematic dismantling of democracy, it is a land uncharted. Journalists, especially those who are independent of the corporate stranglehold, are being routinely and relentlessly persecuted and even murdered around the world. They are a bulwark against fascism we dare not lose. But the arrest of Assange is representative of a free press now under constant threat of annihilation. And it will without a doubt grow even more difficult for them to navigate through the mendacity of a ruthless ruling order that has become utterly unrestrained.\nKenn Orphan is an artist, sociologist, radical nature lover and weary, but committed activist.

These are War Democrats, of course, who never met a defense corporation or armed intervention that they didn&rsquo;t like. One is not surprised to hear them howling for revenge against the &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; who revealed American war crimes to the world.</p>\n<p>Democrats calling themselves progressives are more inclined to defend Assange &ndash; sort of &ndash; on the ground that his imminent prosecution represents an attack on journalistic freedom that may make it difficult for the media to publish classified documents like those contained in the Pentagon Papers. More legalistic progressives aren&rsquo;t so sure about this, since they consider <em>publishing </em>classified info OK so long as it has been &ldquo;sanitized&rdquo; to avoid exposing intelligence agents, but <em>obtaining </em>the info by hacking into a government computer not ok: i.e., a crime.</p>\n<p>What neither camp wants to talk about, however, is whether it&rsquo;s ok to break securities laws in order to expose the American Empire&rsquo;s war plans, errors, and misdeeds.</p>\n<p>Thus, my earlier question: why is lawbreaker Martin Luther King, Jr. a hero and lawbreaker Julian Assange a villain? Intelligent people whom I&rsquo;ve asked about this give the most convoluted and irrelevant answers! &ldquo;Dr. King never threatened American security the way Assange did.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dr. King submitted to arrest, but Assange fled to the security of an embassy.&rdquo; &ldquo;King loved his enemies, but Assange hates America.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The assumption disguised by these rather scholastic distinctions is that Martin attacked an obviously evil system &ndash; American institutional racism &ndash; while Julian only attacked . . . the American Empire. So if you don&rsquo;t want to admit that the empire is evil (or even that it exists), you talk about national security or journalistic freedom or something. Anything but imperialist warmaking.</p>\n<p>Dr. King himself did not make that mistake. What he finally came to understand was that racism, the oppression of the poor, and empire-building are co-dependent, interrelated diseases that can only be cured by strenuous efforts to heal all three conditions simultaneously. He called this a &ldquo;revolution of values.&rdquo; On April 4, 1967, at the Riverside Church in New York, he delivered an address called &ldquo;Beyond Vietnam&rdquo; that contained these lines:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war, &ldquo;This way of settling differences is not just.&rdquo; This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation&rsquo;s homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love. Anation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death. [<em>sustained applause</em>]</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think there is not the slightest question that, were he alive, Dr. King would applaud the sort of civil disobedience that exposes the empire&rsquo;s secrets to the world and makes people aware of the crimes and errors committed in places like the Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib prisons, the battlefields of Iraq, and the drone-infested provinces of Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Julian Assange is no saint, and neither was Martin Luther King. They were very different personalities, to be sure. But both put their &ldquo;lives, fortunes, and sacred honor&rdquo; on the line in order to expose the inhumanity, violence, and lies of the powerful elites that rule the globe. On the scale of human values, both ranked Truth and Justice well ahead of Obedience to Authority.</p>\n<p>Listen, Schumer and the rest of you! If you honor Martin, you must also honor Julian. And if you don&rsquo;t understand why this is true, what is the difference between you and Trump? If the U.S. government succeeds in extraditing Assange, let&rsquo;s get ready to celebrate his arrival with a protest recalling the 1963 March on Washington. It&rsquo;s what King would have done.</p>",

                "text": "Will someone please explain to me why Martin Luther King, Jr. is considered a hero for violating laws sustaining the system of racial discrimination, while Julian Assange is considered a villain for violating laws sustaining the system of imperial war?\nDemocratic Party bigwigs are celebrating the arrest of the Wikileaks founder in London and the request of Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department for his extradition to the U.S. According to Senators Chuck Schumer, Mark Warner, and Joe Manchin \u2013 and, of course, ex-Senator Hilary Clinton \u2013 Assange deserves to be punished severely for plotting with Chelsea Manning to obtain and release classified military information, and for allegedly helping the Russians to influence the election of 2016. These are War Democrats, of course, who never met a defense corporation or armed intervention that they didn\u2019t like. One is not surprised to hear them howling for revenge against the \u201ctraitor\u201d who revealed American war crimes to the world.\nDemocrats calling themselves progressives are more inclined to defend Assange \u2013 sort of \u2013 on the ground that his imminent prosecution represents an attack on journalistic freedom that may make it difficult for the media to publish classified documents like those contained in the Pentagon Papers. More legalistic progressives aren\u2019t so sure about this, since they consider publishing classified info OK so long as it has been \u201csanitized\u201d to avoid exposing intelligence agents, but obtaining the info by hacking into a government computer not ok: i.e., a crime.\nWhat neither camp wants to talk about, however, is whether it\u2019s ok to break securities laws in order to expose the American Empire\u2019s war plans, errors, and misdeeds.\nThus, my earlier question: why is lawbreaker Martin Luther King, Jr. a hero and lawbreaker Julian Assange a villain? Intelligent people whom I\u2019ve asked about this give the most convoluted and irrelevant answers! \u201cDr. King never threatened American security the way Assange did.\u201d \u201cDr. King submitted to arrest, but Assange fled to the security of an embassy.\u201d \u201cKing loved his enemies, but Assange hates America.\u201d\nThe assumption disguised by these rather scholastic distinctions is that Martin attacked an obviously evil system \u2013 American institutional racism \u2013 while Julian only attacked . . . the American Empire. So if you don\u2019t want to admit that the empire is evil (or even that it exists), you talk about national security or journalistic freedom or something. Anything but imperialist warmaking.\nDr. King himself did not make that mistake. What he finally came to understand was that racism, the oppression of the poor, and empire-building are co-dependent, interrelated diseases that can only be cured by strenuous efforts to heal all three conditions simultaneously. He called this a \u201crevolution of values.\u201d On April 4, 1967, at the Riverside Church in New York, he delivered an address called \u201cBeyond Vietnam\u201d that contained these lines:\nA true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war, \u201cThis way of settling differences is not just.\u201d This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation\u2019s homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love. Anation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death. [sustained applause]\nI think there is not the slightest question that, were he alive, Dr. King would applaud the sort of civil disobedience that exposes the empire\u2019s secrets to the world and makes people aware of the crimes and errors committed in places like the Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib prisons, the battlefields of Iraq, and the drone-infested provinces of Afghanistan.\nJulian Assange is no saint, and neither was Martin Luther King. They were very different personalities, to be sure. But both put their \u201clives, fortunes, and sacred honor\u201d on the line in order to expose the inhumanity, violence, and lies of the powerful elites that rule the globe. On the scale of human values, both ranked Truth and Justice well ahead of Obedience to Authority.\nListen, Schumer and the rest of you! If you honor Martin, you must also honor Julian. And if you don\u2019t understand why this is true, what is the difference between you and Trump? If the U.S. government succeeds in extraditing Assange, let\u2019s get ready to celebrate his arrival with a protest recalling the 1963 March on Washington. It\u2019s what King would have done.",

He has an acute sense of who holds &ndash; and does not hold &ndash; power and how to manipulate it. No wonder he gets on well with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.</p>\n<p>His political approach has not varied much since he first came to prominence as an Israeli diplomat in Washington during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 when he showed his skills as a propagandist in defending the Israeli war record, particularly during the bombing of Beirut. Speaking good American English, he knew exactly what to say on US television channels and his skills in dealing with American politics and the media have never deserted him.</p>\n<p>When he eventually is replaced by another prime minister, a big difference will be that his successor may be less inclined &ndash; and will certainly be less capable &ndash; of becoming a player in US politics.</p>\n<p>Netanyahu has always been astute politician, but his public stance is not always easy to interpret. One point to be made about his belligerent rhetorical style that helps explain his political longevity is that he commonly exaggerates threats from a host of supposed mortal enemies such as Iran or the <a data-vars-event-id=\"c6\" data-vars-item-name=\"BL-8863671-/topic/palestinians\" href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/palestinians\">Palestinians</a>, but he has been very averse to going to war. Possibly his experience during the war in Lebanon in 1982-4 made him particularly careful about this. Military action when it takes place is in the shape of air, rather than ground, attacks.</p>\n<p>This helps explain why &ldquo;Bibi&rdquo; is now likely to become Israeli prime minister for the fifth time after the election that concluded yesterday. Israeli voters like leaders who talk tough, but not those who get them engaged in long or, as is the more common experience, inconclusive wars. Even during the peak of Netanyahu&rsquo;s verbal assaults on Iran as a threat to <a data-vars-event-id=\"c6\" data-vars-item-name=\"BL-8863671-/topic/Israel\" href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Israel\">Israel</a>, there has been a certain caution in Israeli military action in Syria and Lebanon.</p>\n<p>The most important election that Netanyahu won was in 1996 against Shimon Peres, after the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin the previous year. He played along with the Oslo Accords, but his electoral victory was a decisive defeat for the Israelis who supported them.</p>\n<p>He has been accused of shifting the agenda from the two-state solution to promising the annexation of Israeli settlements on the <a data-vars-event-id=\"c6\" data-vars-item-name=\"BL-8863671-/topic/WestBank\" href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/WestBank\">West Bank</a> during the present election campaign. But the so-called two-state solution was always something of a charade enabling foreign diplomats to pretend that there was a &ldquo;peace process&rdquo; that was dead and buried. Likewise, moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and the US recognition of the Israeli annexation of the <a data-vars-event-id=\"c6\" data-vars-item-name=\"BL-8863671-/topic/golan-heights\" href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/golan-heights\">Golan Heights</a> do not really change a balance of power that is wholly in Israel&rsquo;s favour.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Palestinians will still be there in Israel, <a data-vars-event-id=\"c6\" data-vars-item-name=\"BL-8863671-/topic/gaza\" href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gaza\">Gaza</a> and the West Bank; Israel never achieves a final victory. Netanyahu has done nothing to change this &ndash; but then neither did previous Israeli leaders, whatever they claimed they were doing.</p>",

                "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu is an early version of the nationalist populist leaders that have come to power in country after country in recent decades. He has an acute sense of who holds \u2013 and does not hold \u2013 power and how to manipulate it. No wonder he gets on well with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.\nHis political approach has not varied much since he first came to prominence as an Israeli diplomat in Washington during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 when he showed his skills as a propagandist in defending the Israeli war record, particularly during the bombing of Beirut. Speaking good American English, he knew exactly what to say on US television channels and his skills in dealing with American politics and the media have never deserted him.\nWhen he eventually is replaced by another prime minister, a big difference will be that his successor may be less inclined \u2013 and will certainly be less capable \u2013 of becoming a player in US politics.\nNetanyahu has always been astute politician, but his public stance is not always easy to interpret. One point to be made about his belligerent rhetorical style that helps explain his political longevity is that he commonly exaggerates threats from a host of supposed mortal enemies such as Iran or the Palestinians, but he has been very averse to going to war. Possibly his experience during the war in Lebanon in 1982-4 made him particularly careful about this. Military action when it takes place is in the shape of air, rather than ground, attacks.\nThis helps explain why \u201cBibi\u201d is now likely to become Israeli prime minister for the fifth time after the election that concluded yesterday. Israeli voters like leaders who talk tough, but not those who get them engaged in long or, as is the more common experience, inconclusive wars. Even during the peak of Netanyahu\u2019s verbal assaults on Iran as a threat to Israel, there has been a certain caution in Israeli military action in Syria and Lebanon.\nThe most important election that Netanyahu won was in 1996 against Shimon Peres, after the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin the previous year. He played along with the Oslo Accords, but his electoral victory was a decisive defeat for the Israelis who supported them.\nHe has been accused of shifting the agenda from the two-state solution to promising the annexation of Israeli settlements on the West Bank during the present election campaign. But the so-called two-state solution was always something of a charade enabling foreign diplomats to pretend that there was a \u201cpeace process\u201d that was dead and buried. Likewise, moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and the US recognition of the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights do not really change a balance of power that is wholly in Israel\u2019s favour.\nOn the other hand, the Palestinians will still be there in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank; Israel never achieves a final victory. Netanyahu has done nothing to change this \u2013 but then neither did previous Israeli leaders, whatever they claimed they were doing.",

In the quarter-century over which its acolytes have swelled, recycling has almost come full circle, from near total indifference all the way around to near total impossibility. In between, and especially over the past couple of years, just when many localities had seen the light, their recycling efforts started bogging down. It wasn&rsquo;t just that China banned imports of raw recyclables from the US in early 2018, although that was a wallop that the industry hasn&rsquo;t recovered from. A 2018 <a href=\"https://ecology.wa.gov/Waste-Toxics/Reducing-recycling-waste/China-s-recycling-ban\">report</a> from the Washington State Ecology Department notes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>China is the largest consumer of North American recyclables. One-third of all scrap material collected in the U.S. is shipped overseas, with the large majority going to China. In 2016, the U.S. exported $5.6 billion in scrap commodities to China. This makes recyclable materials the sixth largest U.S. export to China.<a href=\"applewebdata://95A957F9-E208-436A-AF31-8B3D3D04652A#_edn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The prime reason China gave for rejecting American trash was that its valuable plastics were laced with non-recyclable contaminants. This was true, and I&rsquo;ll talk about why, but Trump&rsquo;s tariffs and geopolitical rivalry probably made it happen when it did. Regardless, even had China not shut that door, we would still be in a tizzy over how to make our vast waste stream go away. Americans simply buy and toss too much stuff and their expectations that it will all be magically disposed of properly simply don&rsquo;t jibe with reality.</p>\n<p>When I first lobbied for recycling more household waste in the 1980s, few types of rubbish could be handled by recycling facilities&mdash;if you or your department of public works could find one. A lot has changed for the better since then. <a href=\"https://global-recycling.info/archives/2172\">According</a>to the economic consulting firm John Dunham &amp; Associates, by 2017 the US recycling industry had an economic impact of $117 billion and directly or indirectly employed more than 534,500 workers to collect, haul, process, and furnish facilities, equipment, transportation, and supplies.<a href=\"applewebdata://95A957F9-E208-436A-AF31-8B3D3D04652A#_edn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>But how can we tell if that money is well spent, how well are towns, cities, states, and the industry handling all the stuff we keep throwing out, and what&rsquo;s a citizen-consumer to do about it?</p>\n<p>Last year, our town just west of Boston switched solid waste vendors to boost trash collection to new heights of automation. Within a month, its new contractor had distributed two massive two-wheeled receptacles to every household: a black one with a 64-gallon capacity for garbage, and a bigger blue 96-gallon one&mdash;large enough to stuff a couple of non-dismembered bodies into &mdash; for recyclables. The town instructed residents to wheel out their carts and line them along the curb on pickup day, front facing the street, with lids closed. Citizens dutifully obey, emplacing the sturdy sentinels to form temporary no-parking zones. And in winter, when snow mounds up over curbs, the carts make driving along narrow streets even more of a slalom.</p>\n<p>My household&rsquo;s carts are rarely more than a quarter full. As they are a pain to rumble out to the curb, I&rsquo;m sometimes tempted to deposit our one or two waste bags in a neighbor&rsquo;s cart. But that somehow feels more transgressive that it should, and, as many residents top theirs off and some keep going, there might not be room in it. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how one family can possibly generate that much solid waste, but a lot of them do. Overflowing carts are officially prohibited, but they get emptied anyway, with occasional spillage for critters to root through.</p>\n<p>Trash gets picked up every week; recycling every other week on the same day. Two sets of towering garbage trucks lumber through the streets with retractable robot arms that grasp one-inch-thick steel bars on the bins to tip them into their hoppers, and then set the empties down with a resounding thud. As the new carts plus contents are too heavy for most mortals to lift, the robots are necessary. And, whereas each truck formerly had a driver plus one or two sanitation workers to pick up and empty our old trash barrels, now only the drivers remain. Even aided by cameras and other sensors to deploy the arms, the driver has more to do than before, and the workers that formerly rode with them are ostensibly looking for jobs, perhaps repairing robots.</p>\n<p>The new receptacles are unwieldy, hulking eyesores that clog curbs and take up more space to stow than the barrels they replaced, which either now clutter yards and driveways or were pitched into the waste stream. The new bins&rsquo; greater capacity encourages residents to consume more stuff and, being free, deprive stores that sell trash barrels of accustomed revenues, their distant supplier having cut out those middlemen. On the plus side, we now have single-stream recycling, meaning we can chuck all our recyclable items, whether paper, glass, metal, or plastic, into the same bin. No more sorting conundrums like &ldquo;Does this juice carton go with paper or plastic?&rdquo; Nonetheless, such convenience comes at a price.</p>\n<p>After decades of nagging by environmental pressure groups and citizen activists, the public and municipal officials are starting to get real&mdash;even enthusiastic&mdash;about recycling. The same forces have pressured consumer product companies, food processors, and food vendors to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, with some success. But while less waste goes to waste than used to, much of it&mdash;particularly plastics&mdash;poses difficult challenges to recyclers as the composition of the waste stream and demand for recycled materials have changed.</p>\n<p>Take paper products: Thanks mainly to electronic documents and drastic declines in newspaper readership, there&rsquo;s a lot less recyclable paper being tossed out and less demand for it. Also, the supply of corrugated cardboard (think home delivery detritus) keeps growing. Cardboard can be transformed into more of the same and building materials. For paper, less consumption means a smaller or stagnant market for recycled paper fiber. As waste paper becomes less valuable, fewer recycling haulers want to handle it, and those that do may charge municipalities more for the privilege.</p>\n<p>Increasingly replaced by plastic ones, fewer glass bottles and jars are being discarded. Their affixed labels make them unsuitable for remanufacturing, so most get get pulverized for mixing into concrete and asphalt, but that product isn&rsquo;t very profitable. Too, the plastic containers superseding them keep getting flimsier. Many are made of lower-grade resin that isn&rsquo;t economical to recycle into other products. And because they are so much lighter, a ton of them (the unit of measure for valuing most recyclable materials) takes up way more space than glass, metal, or paper, decreasing the tonnage and thus the value of a truckload of baled plastic. Many containers are made of PET (polyethylene terephthalate, a clear polyester resin, also made into plastic sheets and films). Despite possibly leaching endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the more rigid PET containers are sought-after recyclables. However, for PET to be eligible for remanufacturing, flimsy lower-grade containers must first be separated out. As triaging PET is labor-intensive, many processing facilities don&rsquo;t bother to, prompting some of China&rsquo;s complaints.</p>\n<p>To discover which type of plastic you are about to toss, you should refer to its resin code, fuzzily embossed within a triangle on container bottoms (keep a magnifier handy). But bearing such a brand doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean an item is recyclable. That totally depends on whether the recycling facility your trash gets sent to accepts that code, which isn&rsquo;t generally easy to know (ask your local DPW.) Here&rsquo;s a cheat sheet that identifies the seven most common resins, what they are used for, and what types of products they can be recycled into. PET&rsquo;s code number is one.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" src=\"https://uziiw38pmyg1ai60732c4011-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/dropzone/2019/04/7-resin-codes.jpg\" srcset=\"https://uziiw38pmyg1ai60732c4011-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/dropzone/2019/04/7-resin-codes.jpg 468w, https://uziiw38pmyg1ai60732c4011-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/dropzone/2019/04/7-resin-codes-150x150.jpg 150w, https://uziiw38pmyg1ai60732c4011-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/dropzone/2019/04/7-resin-codes-300x300.jpg 300w\"></img><figcaption>Seven resin codes.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Confounding this regime, many containers for food and consumer products imported from abroad don&rsquo;t carry resin identifiers, puzzling diligent consumers and complicating their recycling. In addition, many foods now come in even lighter packaging, such as thin-film pouches. Think about potato chips, which once came in wax or coated paper bags; now many are sealed in metalized Mylar (PET) pouches. While they create less waste, pouches aren&rsquo;t a win for recyclers because there&rsquo;s less substance to make new things out of and what there is may consist of compound materials that can&rsquo;t be economically separated. And so, much packaging gets buried or burned. In a landfill, its half-life is measured in centuries. Combusted in a furnace, it fills the air we breathe with all sorts of exciting compounds. And even if recyclable, many plastics expose humans to allergens, immune suppressants, endocrine disruptors, and carcinogens with effects such as adiposity, insulin resistance, and decreased levels of sex hormones, harming children most of all.<a href=\"applewebdata://95A957F9-E208-436A-AF31-8B3D3D04652A#_edn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>\n<p>Those nice heavy-duty black takeout food containers&mdash;and in fact all black plastics&mdash;aren&rsquo;t recyclable, by the way. Even though most are PET, as sturdy as they may be, they end up in landfills because the spectral scanners that inform automate sorting machines can&rsquo;t see into them to determine what they&rsquo;re made of. If you are presented with one, feel free to wash and reuse it and request that the vendor switch to paper containers like Chinese food boxes. Being plastic-coated, they aren&rsquo;t recyclable either, but at least they aren&rsquo;t completely plastic.</p>\n<p>And then there is food wrap, lightweight plastic grocery and produce bags, bubble wrap, and those puffy little pillows that you find nestled in delivery parcels that get thrown or blown into oceans and waterways, strangling or immobilizing marine animals. Nearly nine million tons of plastics enter the world&rsquo;s oceans every year, much of which nature has kindly accumulated in five giant garbage patches around the planet, as The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and others have reported. The largest of these, the <em>Great Pacific Garbage Patch</em>between Hawaii and the US mainland, is the size of France. Nonprofit organization <a href=\"https://www.theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/\">The Ocean Cleanup</a><a href=\"applewebdata://95A957F9-E208-436A-AF31-8B3D3D04652A#_edn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>explains that, over time, plastic items degrade into tiny motes of &ldquo;microplastic&rdquo; that marine organisms ingest and pass up the food chain, eventually to people.</p>\n<p>Plastic bags aren&rsquo;t suitable for recycling but many are disposed of as if they were, along with flimsy, clear clam-shell produce containers and crinkly beverage bottles&mdash;all low-grade materials that can&rsquo;t be given a new life, despite being labeled with an acceptable resin number. They must be separated at the plant to prevent grinders from seizing up and reusable byproducts from being polluted. Given China&rsquo;s trash embargo, there is room for improvement.</p>\n<p>To add to our confusion, different localities have varying rules governing what materials are accepted for recycling. You might be told not to recycle glassware along with bottles. Lids may or may not need to be removed from bottles and jars. Tinfoil, egg cartons, or empty pill bottles may or may not be accepted. Certain resin identifiers may be excluded, as may small metal items and scraps, but not cans.<a href=\"https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/the-problems-with-bioplastics/Content?oid=22699508\">According</a>to the East Bay Express, even so-called &ldquo;compostable bioplastic&rdquo; containers, tableware, and utensils are likely to be unwanted. Sadly, although made from plant material such as starch, chitin, and sugar cane, they won&rsquo;t degrade in your compost heap; it takes processing plants with high-temperature digesters to break them down, but once tossed into the waste stream they are rarely rescued. Same for compostable clear bioplastics made with PLA (polylactic acid, identified by a green stripe). Most consumers blithely recycle them along with petroleum-based plastics. If recyclers can&rsquo;t sort them out, the batch is apt to be declared contaminated and sent to a landfill.<a href=\"applewebdata://95A957F9-E208-436A-AF31-8B3D3D04652A#_edn5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a long way to go.

Bring reusable bags with you when you shop. Top off a durable water bottle with filtered tap water and take it with you when you leave home. Don&rsquo;t buy bottled water or any beverage in flimsy bottles. (In any event, bottled water costs more per gallon than gasoline and may not be all that pure.) Tell your grocer you want to take home produce in paper bags or cardboard containers, not those clear plastic ones that are so hard to wrench open and whose future uses are limited to growing seedlings. Better yet, bring reusable produce bags with you when you shop. Also, ask the meat counter to wrap meat, poultry and fish in paper rather than put them out shrink-wrapped polystyrene trays, or at least to dispense with the trays.</p>\n<p>Buy beer and soda in cans or glass bottles. Lobby for &ldquo;bottle bills&rdquo; that require deposits on drink containers and for bans on disposable plastic grocery bags. Bring your own mugs to caf&eacute;s and invest in a few metal straws. Compost food scraps and dispose of what you can&rsquo;t in paper sacks rather than in plastic garbage bags whose sole mission is to be buried or burned. If you&rsquo;re an apartment dweller, advocate for a municipal composting program to divert food scraps from landfills to community gardens.</p>\n<p>And when you need durable goods, find used appliances, furniture, clothes, and electronics on Craigslist or Freecycle or at rummage sales.

Join environmental groups working in your area to reduce the waste steam and ban stuff like Styrofoam containers, plastic bags, cutlery, and straws.</p>\n<p>Good progress is being made in banning or cutting down on non-reusable plastic items and toxic ingredients like <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Bisphenol+A\">bisphenol-A</a> (BPA).<a href=\"applewebdata://95A957F9-E208-436A-AF31-8B3D3D04652A#_edn8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a>Even so, there&rsquo;s only so much a person, an organization, or even the recycling industry itself can do to stem the tsunami of product containers, more and more of which are of such complex or exotic construction that they cannot be recycled at all. These sorts of trashy innovations have to be curtailed.</p>\n<p>The only reason for having a 96-gallon recycling cart is to hold all those boxes and containers that consumable products come in. If mountains of unusable refuse are the necessary price of economic growth, we need to rethink the whole economy, starting with home economics. Reduce mail orders. Buy locally made products from local retailers and pay them with cash or checks. (They&rsquo;ll thank you.) Choose and demand low-tech packaging, preferably plant-based that can be recycled, downcycled, or composted. Bone up on which plastics can harm your health. Reuse empty containers that are hard to recycle to the extent it&rsquo;s practical or safe. Walk, cycle, scoot, or take transit to the store and of course, don&rsquo;t forget your shopping bags.</p>\n<p><em>An earlier version of this article appeared in <a href=\"https://thetechnoskeptic.com/talking-trash-recycling/\">The Technoskeptic</a> magazine, 3/20/2019.</em></p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"applewebdata://95A957F9-E208-436A-AF31-8B3D3D04652A#_ednref1\">[1]</a> China&rsquo;s Recycling Ban, Dept. of Ecology, University of Washington, https://ecology.wa.gov/Waste-Toxics/Reducing-recycling-waste/China-s-recycling-ban</p>\n<p><a href=\"applewebdata://95A957F9-E208-436A-AF31-8B3D3D04652A#_ednref2\">[2]</a>Global Recycling Magazine (2018), <em>USA: Recycling Generates 117 Billion US-Dollar per Year</em>, https://global-recycling.info/archives/2172</p>\n<p><a href=\"applewebdata://95A957F9-E208-436A-AF31-8B3D3D04652A#_ednref3\">[3]</a>Rustagi, N., Pradhan, S.

                "text": "Americans have come to embrace recycling their trash with an almost religious fervor, but in some sense they are praying to a false god. In the quarter-century over which its acolytes have swelled, recycling has almost come full circle, from near total indifference all the way around to near total impossibility. In between, and especially over the past couple of years, just when many localities had seen the light, their recycling efforts started bogging down. It wasn\u2019t just that China banned imports of raw recyclables from the US in early 2018, although that was a wallop that the industry hasn\u2019t recovered from. A 2018 report from the Washington State Ecology Department notes:\nChina is the largest consumer of North American recyclables. One-third of all scrap material collected in the U.S. is shipped overseas, with the large majority going to China. In 2016, the U.S. exported $5.6 billion in scrap commodities to China. This makes recyclable materials the sixth largest U.S. export to China.[1]\nThe prime reason China gave for rejecting American trash was that its valuable plastics were laced with non-recyclable contaminants. This was true, and I\u2019ll talk about why, but Trump\u2019s tariffs and geopolitical rivalry probably made it happen when it did. Regardless, even had China not shut that door, we would still be in a tizzy over how to make our vast waste stream go away. Americans simply buy and toss too much stuff and their expectations that it will all be magically disposed of properly simply don\u2019t jibe with reality.\nWhen I first lobbied for recycling more household waste in the 1980s, few types of rubbish could be handled by recycling facilities\u2014if you or your department of public works could find one. A lot has changed for the better since then. Accordingto the economic consulting firm John Dunham & Associates, by 2017 the US recycling industry had an economic impact of $117 billion and directly or indirectly employed more than 534,500 workers to collect, haul, process, and furnish facilities, equipment, transportation, and supplies.[2]But how can we tell if that money is well spent, how well are towns, cities, states, and the industry handling all the stuff we keep throwing out, and what\u2019s a citizen-consumer to do about it?\nLast year, our town just west of Boston switched solid waste vendors to boost trash collection to new heights of automation. Within a month, its new contractor had distributed two massive two-wheeled receptacles to every household: a black one with a 64-gallon capacity for garbage, and a bigger blue 96-gallon one\u2014large enough to stuff a couple of non-dismembered bodies into \u2014 for recyclables. The town instructed residents to wheel out their carts and line them along the curb on pickup day, front facing the street, with lids closed. Citizens dutifully obey, emplacing the sturdy sentinels to form temporary no-parking zones. And in winter, when snow mounds up over curbs, the carts make driving along narrow streets even more of a slalom.\nMy household\u2019s carts are rarely more than a quarter full. As they are a pain to rumble out to the curb, I\u2019m sometimes tempted to deposit our one or two waste bags in a neighbor\u2019s cart. But that somehow feels more transgressive that it should, and, as many residents top theirs off and some keep going, there might not be room in it. It\u2019s hard to imagine how one family can possibly generate that much solid waste, but a lot of them do. Overflowing carts are officially prohibited, but they get emptied anyway, with occasional spillage for critters to root through.\nTrash gets picked up every week; recycling every other week on the same day. Two sets of towering garbage trucks lumber through the streets with retractable robot arms that grasp one-inch-thick steel bars on the bins to tip them into their hoppers, and then set the empties down with a resounding thud. As the new carts plus contents are too heavy for most mortals to lift, the robots are necessary. And, whereas each truck formerly had a driver plus one or two sanitation workers to pick up and empty our old trash barrels, now only the drivers remain. Even aided by cameras and other sensors to deploy the arms, the driver has more to do than before, and the workers that formerly rode with them are ostensibly looking for jobs, perhaps repairing robots.\nThe new receptacles are unwieldy, hulking eyesores that clog curbs and take up more space to stow than the barrels they replaced, which either now clutter yards and driveways or were pitched into the waste stream. The new bins\u2019 greater capacity encourages residents to consume more stuff and, being free, deprive stores that sell trash barrels of accustomed revenues, their distant supplier having cut out those middlemen. On the plus side, we now have single-stream recycling, meaning we can chuck all our recyclable items, whether paper, glass, metal, or plastic, into the same bin. No more sorting conundrums like \u201cDoes this juice carton go with paper or plastic?\u201d Nonetheless, such convenience comes at a price.\nAfter decades of nagging by environmental pressure groups and citizen activists, the public and municipal officials are starting to get real\u2014even enthusiastic\u2014about recycling. The same forces have pressured consumer product companies, food processors, and food vendors to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, with some success. But while less waste goes to waste than used to, much of it\u2014particularly plastics\u2014poses difficult challenges to recyclers as the composition of the waste stream and demand for recycled materials have changed.\nTake paper products: Thanks mainly to electronic documents and drastic declines in newspaper readership, there\u2019s a lot less recyclable paper being tossed out and less demand for it. Also, the supply of corrugated cardboard (think home delivery detritus) keeps growing. Cardboard can be transformed into more of the same and building materials. For paper, less consumption means a smaller or stagnant market for recycled paper fiber. As waste paper becomes less valuable, fewer recycling haulers want to handle it, and those that do may charge municipalities more for the privilege.\nIncreasingly replaced by plastic ones, fewer glass bottles and jars are being discarded. Their affixed labels make them unsuitable for remanufacturing, so most get get pulverized for mixing into concrete and asphalt, but that product isn\u2019t very profitable. Too, the plastic containers superseding them keep getting flimsier. Many are made of lower-grade resin that isn\u2019t economical to recycle into other products. And because they are so much lighter, a ton of them (the unit of measure for valuing most recyclable materials) takes up way more space than glass, metal, or paper, decreasing the tonnage and thus the value of a truckload of baled plastic. Many containers are made of PET (polyethylene terephthalate, a clear polyester resin, also made into plastic sheets and films). Despite possibly leaching endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the more rigid PET containers are sought-after recyclables. However, for PET to be eligible for remanufacturing, flimsy lower-grade containers must first be separated out. As triaging PET is labor-intensive, many processing facilities don\u2019t bother to, prompting some of China\u2019s complaints.\nTo discover which type of plastic you are about to toss, you should refer to its resin code, fuzzily embossed within a triangle on container bottoms (keep a magnifier handy). But bearing such a brand doesn\u2019t necessarily mean an item is recyclable. That totally depends on whether the recycling facility your trash gets sent to accepts that code, which isn\u2019t generally easy to know (ask your local DPW.) Here\u2019s a cheat sheet that identifies the seven most common resins, what they are used for, and what types of products they can be recycled into. PET\u2019s code number is one.\nConfounding this regime, many containers for food and consumer products imported from abroad don\u2019t carry resin identifiers, puzzling diligent consumers and complicating their recycling. In addition, many foods now come in even lighter packaging, such as thin-film pouches. Think about potato chips, which once came in wax or coated paper bags; now many are sealed in metalized Mylar (PET) pouches. While they create less waste, pouches aren\u2019t a win for recyclers because there\u2019s less substance to make new things out of and what there is may consist of compound materials that can\u2019t be economically separated. And so, much packaging gets buried or burned. In a landfill, its half-life is measured in centuries. Combusted in a furnace, it fills the air we breathe with all sorts of exciting compounds. And even if recyclable, many plastics expose humans to allergens, immune suppressants, endocrine disruptors, and carcinogens with effects such as adiposity, insulin resistance, and decreased levels of sex hormones, harming children most of all.[3]\nThose nice heavy-duty black takeout food containers\u2014and in fact all black plastics\u2014aren\u2019t recyclable, by the way. Even though most are PET, as sturdy as they may be, they end up in landfills because the spectral scanners that inform automate sorting machines can\u2019t see into them to determine what they\u2019re made of. If you are presented with one, feel free to wash and reuse it and request that the vendor switch to paper containers like Chinese food boxes. Being plastic-coated, they aren\u2019t recyclable either, but at least they aren\u2019t completely plastic.\nAnd then there is food wrap, lightweight plastic grocery and produce bags, bubble wrap, and those puffy little pillows that you find nestled in delivery parcels that get thrown or blown into oceans and waterways, strangling or immobilizing marine animals. Nearly nine million tons of plastics enter the world\u2019s oceans every year, much of which nature has kindly accumulated in five giant garbage patches around the planet, as The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and others have reported. The largest of these, the Great Pacific Garbage Patchbetween Hawaii and the US mainland, is the size of France. Nonprofit organization The Ocean Cleanup[4]explains that, over time, plastic items degrade into tiny motes of \u201cmicroplastic\u201d that marine organisms ingest and pass up the food chain, eventually to people.\nPlastic bags aren\u2019t suitable for recycling but many are disposed of as if they were, along with flimsy, clear clam-shell produce containers and crinkly beverage bottles\u2014all low-grade materials that can\u2019t be given a new life, despite being labeled with an acceptable resin number. They must be separated at the plant to prevent grinders from seizing up and reusable byproducts from being polluted. Given China\u2019s trash embargo, there is room for improvement.\nTo add to our confusion, different localities have varying rules governing what materials are accepted for recycling. You might be told not to recycle glassware along with bottles. Lids may or may not need to be removed from bottles and jars. Tinfoil, egg cartons, or empty pill bottles may or may not be accepted. Certain resin identifiers may be excluded, as may small metal items and scraps, but not cans.Accordingto the East Bay Express, even so-called \u201ccompostable bioplastic\u201d containers, tableware, and utensils are likely to be unwanted. Sadly, although made from plant material such as starch, chitin, and sugar cane, they won\u2019t degrade in your compost heap; it takes processing plants with high-temperature digesters to break them down, but once tossed into the waste stream they are rarely rescued. Same for compostable clear bioplastics made with PLA (polylactic acid, identified by a green stripe). Most consumers blithely recycle them along with petroleum-based plastics. If recyclers can\u2019t sort them out, the batch is apt to be declared contaminated and sent to a landfill.[5]\nThere\u2019s a long way to go. Despite a leveling off of per-capita waste creation, our total waste production continues to climb:\nFor further inconvenient facts and figures on recycling in the US, though not the most up-to-date, see Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: 2015, a publication by the EPA that quantifies trends in material generation and disposal methods between 1960 and 2015.[6]Among other things, it reveals that paper products by far have the highest rate of recycling: 66 percent, by weight, in 2015. The worst? Plastic, at 9.1 percent, as this chart (courtesy of The Technoskeptic) shows.\nSee also the Waste360 website[7] for many interactive graphics depicting what gets recycled and what doesn\u2019t.\nYou wanna help? Bring reusable bags with you when you shop. Top off a durable water bottle with filtered tap water and take it with you when you leave home. Don\u2019t buy bottled water or any beverage in flimsy bottles. (In any event, bottled water costs more per gallon than gasoline and may not be all that pure.) Tell your grocer you want to take home produce in paper bags or cardboard containers, not those clear plastic ones that are so hard to wrench open and whose future uses are limited to growing seedlings. Better yet, bring reusable produce bags with you when you shop. Also, ask the meat counter to wrap meat, poultry and fish in paper rather than put them out shrink-wrapped polystyrene trays, or at least to dispense with the trays.\nBuy beer and soda in cans or glass bottles. Lobby for \u201cbottle bills\u201d that require deposits on drink containers and for bans on disposable plastic grocery bags. Bring your own mugs to caf\u00e9s and invest in a few metal straws. Compost food scraps and dispose of what you can\u2019t in paper sacks rather than in plastic garbage bags whose sole mission is to be buried or burned. If you\u2019re an apartment dweller, advocate for a municipal composting program to divert food scraps from landfills to community gardens.\nAnd when you need durable goods, find used appliances, furniture, clothes, and electronics on Craigslist or Freecycle or at rummage sales. Ten of my 12 cars were pre-owned. Each one avoided the junkyard for up to ten years and helped keep my auto mechanic in business. Join environmental groups working in your area to reduce the waste steam and ban stuff like Styrofoam containers, plastic bags, cutlery, and straws.\nGood progress is being made in banning or cutting down on non-reusable plastic items and toxic ingredients like bisphenol-A (BPA).[8]Even so, there\u2019s only so much a person, an organization, or even the recycling industry itself can do to stem the tsunami of product containers, more and more of which are of such complex or exotic construction that they cannot be recycled at all. These sorts of trashy innovations have to be curtailed.\nThe only reason for having a 96-gallon recycling cart is to hold all those boxes and containers that consumable products come in. If mountains of unusable refuse are the necessary price of economic growth, we need to rethink the whole economy, starting with home economics. Reduce mail orders. Buy locally made products from local retailers and pay them with cash or checks. (They\u2019ll thank you.) Choose and demand low-tech packaging, preferably plant-based that can be recycled, downcycled, or composted. Bone up on which plastics can harm your health. Reuse empty containers that are hard to recycle to the extent it\u2019s practical or safe. Walk, cycle, scoot, or take transit to the store and of course, don\u2019t forget your shopping bags.\nAn earlier version of this article appeared in The Technoskeptic magazine, 3/20/2019.\nReferences\n[1] China\u2019s Recycling Ban, Dept. of Ecology, University of Washington, https://ecology.wa.gov/Waste-Toxics/Reducing-recycling-waste/China-s-recycling-ban\n[2]Global Recycling Magazine (2018), USA: Recycling Generates 117 Billion US-Dollar per Year, https://global-recycling.info/archives/2172\n[3]Rustagi, N., Pradhan, S.

Reporters who have attended the proceedings without being able to report them <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-26/george-pell-guilty-child-abuse-how-it-happened/10847786\">now say</a> the court heard testimony that Pell forced one choir boy to perform oral sex on him after mass and that he masturbated in front the other victim while he groped and fondled him.</p>\n<p>One of the two victims died of a drug overdose several years ago which prompted the other victim, who testified in court against the cardinal, to come forward.</p>\n<p>Cardinal Pell will be remanded in custody on Wednesday to await sentencing. He faces up to 50 years in prison.</p>\n<p>The development comes as Pope Francis faces global criticism for his mishandling of clerical sexual abuse, including his reluctance to declare zero tolerance for predators and their enablers at a <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-popes-sex-abuse-summit-whataboutism-undermined-calls-for-penance-and-protection?source=twitter&via=desktop\">landmark summit </a>in Rome this month.</p>\n<p>The Vatican spokesman said on Tuesday that it would withhold final judgement until Pell exhausted his appeals, calling the conviction &ldquo; painfulnews that, we are well aware, has shocked many people, not only in Australia.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Cardinal Pell has reiterated his innocence and has the right to defend himself to the last degree. Waiting for final judgement, we join the Australian bishops in praying for all the victims of abuse,&rdquo; the statement reads. &ldquo;Waiting for the definitive verification of the facts, Cardinal Pell is forbidden as a precautionary measure the public exercise of the ministry and, as a rule, contact in any way or form with minors.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Pell, head of the Vatican&rsquo;s Secretariat for Economic Affairs, is the highest-ranking prelate to face sexual abuse allegations dating back decades.</p>\n<p>In June, as his trial was about to get underway in Melbourne, a judge barred all press coverage in Australia at the request of prosecutors who said publicity could prejudice the jurors.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/vatican-no-3-cardinal-george-pell-on-trial-for-historical-child-sex-charges\"><figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_128/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1544121980/181206-lachlan-pell-tease_rwyxoj\"></img></figure></a></li></ul>\n<p>In the first case&mdash;known as the Cathedral Trial because of where the abuse allegedly happened&mdash;Pell was accused of sexually abusing two choir boys in the 1990s. He was found guilty of one count of penetrating a child under 16 and four counts of indecent acts with a child under 16.</p>\n<p>A mistrial was declared in October due to a hung jury that reportedly was leaning 10-2 in favor of the cardinal. But in December, he was found guilty of five criminal counts on retrial. &ldquo;Like many survivors it has taken me years to understand the impact upon on my life,&rdquo; the surviving victim said in a <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-26/george-pells-victim-responds-to-guilty-verdict/10849832\">statement issued</a> through his lawyer Vivian Waller on Tuesday. &ldquo;At some point we realize that we trusted someone we should have feared and we fear those genuine relationships that we should trust.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Daily Beast was the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/vatican-no-3-cardinal-george-pell-on-trial-for-historical-child-sex-charges?ref=author\">first</a> to report the news of Pell&rsquo;s conviction by &ldquo;geo-blocking&rdquo; the story from Australian audiences in accordance with the suppression order.</p>\n<p>Pell faced additional charges in a second case known as the Swimmers Trial because the alleged offenses took place in a swimming pool and clubhouse.</p>\n<p>The trial was set to begin after the court sentenced Pell in the Cathedral case, but has been abandoned due to lack of admissible evidence.</p>\n<p>A Vatican source close to Pell&rsquo;s defense team told The Daily Beast that the prosecution argued that they had lost a key witness, which led them to agree that the trial should be scuttled.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/child-sex-abuse-charges-against-the-popes-right-hand-man-cast-a-shadow-over-francis\"><figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1895,w_3369,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_128/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1498731752/vatican-child-abuse-george-pell_qmzc03\"></img></figure></a></li></ul>\n<p>Pell, who has been free on bail, has maintained his innocence throughout and is said to be appealing his conviction.</p>\n<p>Despite promises made by Pope Francis to hold prelates on every level accountable for their part in abuse, Pell has not yet been sanctioned or defrocked. He wasn&rsquo;t even removed as head of the Vatican Secretariat of the Economy during his trial and merely remained &ldquo;on leave of absence&rdquo; from the No. 3 post in the Roman Curia. However, in December, after the conviction, he was <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/pope-francis-drops-cardinal-pell-from-key-advisory-group\">removed</a> from the so-called C-9 committee of nine papal advisers.</p>\n<p>The pope has used strong language to condemn abuses&mdash;calling them &ldquo;tools of Satan&rdquo; during his closing remarks at the summit on Sunday&mdash;but has been criticized for not backing up his words with action.</p>\n<p>When asked about Pell on the sidelines of the weekend summit, Australian Archbishop Mark Coleridge told The Daily Beast he would not comment due to the Australian gag order. On Tuesday, he expressed shock to reporters in the lobby of his the residence where he is staying in Rome. &ldquo;The same legal system that delivered the verdict will consider the appeal that the cardinal&rsquo;s legal team has lodged,&rdquo; Coledridge said. &ldquo;Our hope, at all times, is that through this process, justice will be served. In the meantime, we pray for all those who have been abused and their loved ones, and we commit ourselves anew to doing everything possible to ensure that the Church is a safe place for all, especially the young and the vulnerable.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Coleridge was a central figure in the summit, delivering the homily during the closing mass on Sunday. As the president of the Australian Bishops Conference, he is the authoritative figure responsible for Pell's future in the church.</p>\n<p>He will have to make a recommendation to Francis and provide the Vatican Tribunal with evidence from his home country. It is understood that he and the pope did discuss Pell privately during the summit.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have shown too little mercy, and therefore we will receive the same, because the measure we give will be the measure we receive in return,&rdquo; Coleridge said during his homily. &ldquo;We will not go unpunished.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Francis told reporters on board the papal plane on the return from World Youth Day in Poland in 2016 that he would not judge Pell until the judicial process is over, and he refused to comment on the case after news of Pell&rsquo;s conviction surfaced.</p>\n<p>Survivors of clerical sex abuse have called for the removal of Pell&rsquo;s title of cardinal and for his laicization because, as a convicted sexual predator, he should no longer be a representative of the Catholic church or be allowed to continue in ministry. Former U.S. Cardinal <a href=\"Fancy link: https://www.thedailybeast.com/cardinal-mccarrick-becomes-highest-ranking-us-catholic-to-be-defrocked\">Theodore McCarrick was forced to resign</a> last summer and was laicized in February after allegations that he sexually abused a 16-year-old boy in a confessional in New York more than 30 years ago.</p>\n<p>The gag order in the case frustrated abuse victims and their advocates who were keenly interested in the outcome.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Suppression of information is a tool of the powerful,&rdquo; Tim Lennon, president of the Survivors Network for those Abused by Priests (SNAP), told The Daily Beast. &ldquo;Suppression of information must not be a means for an accused criminal to avoid justice for other crimes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Steven Spaner, Australia coordinator for SNAP, told The Daily Beast he was &ldquo;joyous&rdquo; at the news of Pell&rsquo;s conviction, which he said would be welcomed by survivors worldwide.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The fact that Pell was convicted in the first trial is an amazing accomplishment. He may be the winner in the contest for the highest-ranking prelate to go to jail,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Victims will see that justice is at long last coming to them. The survivors have always wanted their day in court and in Australia they finally had their day in court.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Two months after Cardinal George Pell was convicted of sexually abusing boys, a judge has decided the Vatican\u2019s third most powerful official will not face a second trial on similar charges in his home country of Australia.\nThe decision means that a suppression order that kept the proceedings shrouded in secrecy has been lifted and Pell, 77, will now be sentenced in the original case. Reporters who have attended the proceedings without being able to report them now say the court heard testimony that Pell forced one choir boy to perform oral sex on him after mass and that he masturbated in front the other victim while he groped and fondled him.\nOne of the two victims died of a drug overdose several years ago which prompted the other victim, who testified in court against the cardinal, to come forward.\nCardinal Pell will be remanded in custody on Wednesday to await sentencing. He faces up to 50 years in prison.\nThe development comes as Pope Francis faces global criticism for his mishandling of clerical sexual abuse, including his reluctance to declare zero tolerance for predators and their enablers at a landmark summit in Rome this month.\nThe Vatican spokesman said on Tuesday that it would withhold final judgement until Pell exhausted his appeals, calling the conviction \u201c painfulnews that, we are well aware, has shocked many people, not only in Australia.\u201d\n\u201cCardinal Pell has reiterated his innocence and has the right to defend himself to the last degree. Waiting for final judgement, we join the Australian bishops in praying for all the victims of abuse,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWaiting for the definitive verification of the facts, Cardinal Pell is forbidden as a precautionary measure the public exercise of the ministry and, as a rule, contact in any way or form with minors.\u201d\nPell, head of the Vatican\u2019s Secretariat for Economic Affairs, is the highest-ranking prelate to face sexual abuse allegations dating back decades.\nIn June, as his trial was about to get underway in Melbourne, a judge barred all press coverage in Australia at the request of prosecutors who said publicity could prejudice the jurors.\nIn the first case\u2014known as the Cathedral Trial because of where the abuse allegedly happened\u2014Pell was accused of sexually abusing two choir boys in the 1990s. He was found guilty of one count of penetrating a child under 16 and four counts of indecent acts with a child under 16.\nA mistrial was declared in October due to a hung jury that reportedly was leaning 10-2 in favor of the cardinal. But in December, he was found guilty of five criminal counts on retrial. \u201cLike many survivors it has taken me years to understand the impact upon on my life,\u201d the surviving victim said in a statement issued through his lawyer Vivian Waller on Tuesday. \u201cAt some point we realize that we trusted someone we should have feared and we fear those genuine relationships that we should trust.\u201d\nThe Daily Beast was the first to report the news of Pell\u2019s conviction by \u201cgeo-blocking\u201d the story from Australian audiences in accordance with the suppression order.\nPell faced additional charges in a second case known as the Swimmers Trial because the alleged offenses took place in a swimming pool and clubhouse.\nThe trial was set to begin after the court sentenced Pell in the Cathedral case, but has been abandoned due to lack of admissible evidence.\nA Vatican source close to Pell\u2019s defense team told The Daily Beast that the prosecution argued that they had lost a key witness, which led them to agree that the trial should be scuttled.\nPell, who has been free on bail, has maintained his innocence throughout and is said to be appealing his conviction.\nDespite promises made by Pope Francis to hold prelates on every level accountable for their part in abuse, Pell has not yet been sanctioned or defrocked. He wasn\u2019t even removed as head of the Vatican Secretariat of the Economy during his trial and merely remained \u201con leave of absence\u201d from the No. 3 post in the Roman Curia. However, in December, after the conviction, he was removed from the so-called C-9 committee of nine papal advisers.\nThe pope has used strong language to condemn abuses\u2014calling them \u201ctools of Satan\u201d during his closing remarks at the summit on Sunday\u2014but has been criticized for not backing up his words with action.\nWhen asked about Pell on the sidelines of the weekend summit, Australian Archbishop Mark Coleridge told The Daily Beast he would not comment due to the Australian gag order. On Tuesday, he expressed shock to reporters in the lobby of his the residence where he is staying in Rome. \u201cThe same legal system that delivered the verdict will consider the appeal that the cardinal\u2019s legal team has lodged,\u201d Coledridge said. \u201cOur hope, at all times, is that through this process, justice will be served. In the meantime, we pray for all those who have been abused and their loved ones, and we commit ourselves anew to doing everything possible to ensure that the Church is a safe place for all, especially the young and the vulnerable.\u201d\nColeridge was a central figure in the summit, delivering the homily during the closing mass on Sunday. As the president of the Australian Bishops Conference, he is the authoritative figure responsible for Pell's future in the church.\nHe will have to make a recommendation to Francis and provide the Vatican Tribunal with evidence from his home country. It is understood that he and the pope did discuss Pell privately during the summit.\n\u201cWe have shown too little mercy, and therefore we will receive the same, because the measure we give will be the measure we receive in return,\u201d Coleridge said during his homily. \u201cWe will not go unpunished.\u201d\nFrancis told reporters on board the papal plane on the return from World Youth Day in Poland in 2016 that he would not judge Pell until the judicial process is over, and he refused to comment on the case after news of Pell\u2019s conviction surfaced.\nSurvivors of clerical sex abuse have called for the removal of Pell\u2019s title of cardinal and for his laicization because, as a convicted sexual predator, he should no longer be a representative of the Catholic church or be allowed to continue in ministry. Former U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick was forced to resign last summer and was laicized in February after allegations that he sexually abused a 16-year-old boy in a confessional in New York more than 30 years ago.\nThe gag order in the case frustrated abuse victims and their advocates who were keenly interested in the outcome.\n\u201cSuppression of information is a tool of the powerful,\u201d Tim Lennon, president of the Survivors Network for those Abused by Priests (SNAP), told The Daily Beast. \u201cSuppression of information must not be a means for an accused criminal to avoid justice for other crimes.\u201d\nSteven Spaner, Australia coordinator for SNAP, told The Daily Beast he was \u201cjoyous\u201d at the news of Pell\u2019s conviction, which he said would be welcomed by survivors worldwide.\n\u201cThe fact that Pell was convicted in the first trial is an amazing accomplishment. He may be the winner in the contest for the highest-ranking prelate to go to jail,\u201d he said.\n\u201cVictims will see that justice is at long last coming to them. The survivors have always wanted their day in court and in Australia they finally had their day in court.\u201d",

(Saul Loeb / AFP / Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A bill that would ban most Tennessee women from obtaining abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected cleared a key hurdle Tuesday, advancing for a full House vote in the GOP-dominated legislature.</p>\n<p>The move comes amid a national movement by pro-life lawmakers and activists who hope that President Donald Trump&rsquo;s appointments to the Supreme Court will increase their chances of ending or severely restricting legal abortions.</p>\n<p>Tennessee is among several states with pending bills to ban most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, about six weeks into pregnancy.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"> <figure><video><source src=\"https://v.connatix.com/20eb57ac-eaee-41aa-9e1e-605fd4d84eb6/1_360_1.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source></video></figure></a>   </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/20eb57ac-eaee-41aa-9e1e-605fd4d84eb6/1.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=362&width=644\"></img></figure>\n<p>The goal is to trigger a legal challenge to the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established a nationwide right to abortion. Court rulings since then have determined states cannot place undue burdens on abortion before a fetus is viable &mdash; typically between 24 and 28 weeks.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is an issue that has been on my heart my whole life,&rdquo; Rep. Micah Van Huss, a Republican sponsoring the bill, said during Tuesday&rsquo;s hearing. &ldquo;I aim to save babies&rsquo; lives.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The House Health Committee voted 15-4 to send the legislation to the House floor for a full vote, sparking heavy applause from supporters. Only Democratic members voted in opposition.</p>\n<p>While the bill still has to clear the House floor and the Senate, it is expected to win support from Republicans. Furthermore, first-term Gov. Bill Lee has promised his support if the bill reaches his desk.</p>\n<p>Advocates on both sides of the issue packed the room to watch lawmakers spar over possible legal challenges and discuss hypothetical situations of women being forced to carry a baby to term even in cases of rape or incest.</p>\n<p>By the meeting&rsquo;s close, many were breaking out in cheers and jeers in response to lawmakers&rsquo; comments.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have three girls. I&rsquo;ve raised them to be independent so no boy tells them what to do. Well, except for me,&rdquo; said Democratic Rep. Darren Jernigan.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve also said they&rsquo;re in control of their bodies and it bothers me the government would tell them what to do and it bothers me the bill is likely unconstitutional.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When asked if it would be acceptable for a 15-year-old student who was raped by her coach to be barred from having an abortion if she was past the six-week viability marker because a fetal heartbeat was detected, Van Huss simply said &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He responded similarly when asked if he agreed that the same ban should be in place in cases of incest.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is not up to me to determine someone else&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; Van Huss said.</p>\n<p>Critics of the bill predict enactment would trigger an immediate legal challenge, warning that an Iowa judge struck down a similar law last month. In Mississippi, a federal judge declared banning abortion after 15 weeks was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;On the one hand, sensibly speaking, this is unconstitutional and it&rsquo;s going to cost taxpayers dollars.

                "text": "A bill that would ban most Tennessee women from obtaining abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected cleared a key hurdle Tuesday, advancing for a full House vote in the GOP-dominated legislature.\nThe move comes amid a national movement by pro-life lawmakers and activists who hope that President Donald Trump\u2019s appointments to the Supreme Court will increase their chances of ending or severely restricting legal abortions.\nTennessee is among several states with pending bills to ban most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, about six weeks into pregnancy.\nThe goal is to trigger a legal challenge to the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established a nationwide right to abortion. Court rulings since then have determined states cannot place undue burdens on abortion before a fetus is viable \u2014 typically between 24 and 28 weeks.\n\u201cThis is an issue that has been on my heart my whole life,\u201d Rep. Micah Van Huss, a Republican sponsoring the bill, said during Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cI aim to save babies\u2019 lives.\u201d\nThe House Health Committee voted 15-4 to send the legislation to the House floor for a full vote, sparking heavy applause from supporters. Only Democratic members voted in opposition.\nWhile the bill still has to clear the House floor and the Senate, it is expected to win support from Republicans. Furthermore, first-term Gov. Bill Lee has promised his support if the bill reaches his desk.\nAdvocates on both sides of the issue packed the room to watch lawmakers spar over possible legal challenges and discuss hypothetical situations of women being forced to carry a baby to term even in cases of rape or incest.\nBy the meeting\u2019s close, many were breaking out in cheers and jeers in response to lawmakers\u2019 comments.\n\u201cI have three girls. I\u2019ve raised them to be independent so no boy tells them what to do. Well, except for me,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Darren Jernigan.\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve also said they\u2019re in control of their bodies and it bothers me the government would tell them what to do and it bothers me the bill is likely unconstitutional.\u201d\nWhen asked if it would be acceptable for a 15-year-old student who was raped by her coach to be barred from having an abortion if she was past the six-week viability marker because a fetal heartbeat was detected, Van Huss simply said \u201cyes.\u201d\nHe responded similarly when asked if he agreed that the same ban should be in place in cases of incest.\n\u201cIt is not up to me to determine someone else\u2019s life,\u201d Van Huss said.\nCritics of the bill predict enactment would trigger an immediate legal challenge, warning that an Iowa judge struck down a similar law last month. In Mississippi, a federal judge declared banning abortion after 15 weeks was unconstitutional.\n\u201cOn the one hand, sensibly speaking, this is unconstitutional and it\u2019s going to cost taxpayers dollars. While on the other hand, litigation would most surely help to uphold Roe v. Wade as the continued law of the land for women\u2019s health and privacy protections,\u201d said Francie Hunt, executive director of Tennessee Advocates for Planned Parenthood.\nEven the state\u2019s top anti-abortion group, Tennessee Right to Life, has opposed the bill due to the surrounding legal concerns.\nIn 2017, the group testified before lawmakers that its opposition stemmed from Supreme Court rulings banning criminalizing abortion prior to viability. Right to Life has been more subdued in airing concerns surrounding this year\u2019s bill, arguing Tennessee should let other states fight the legal battle.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee has already vowed to fight the legislation in court.\n\u201cA woman should be able to make decisions about what is best for her health and her family in consultation with her doctor and her loved ones, without politicians interfering or trying to force her hand,\u201d Hedy Weinberg, the group\u2019s executive director, said in a statement.\n\u201cIf this bill passes, the ACLU of Tennessee stands ready to file a lawsuit immediately.\u201d\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

John Hickenlooper and others say they did, too.\nImpressive numbers, even if dwarfed by the $6 million or so reported by Bernie Sanders and now Beto O\u2019Rourke.\nThe seven-digit figures for the lesser-known Democratic hopefuls don\u2019t lie, but they don\u2019t tell the whole story either. Early bursts of donations don\u2019t happen by accident, especially for candidates with little national name recognition such as Inslee, who hit his target thanks in part to an email list of donors he\u2019s cultivated for months.\nHe\u2019s among a crowded field of more than a dozen Democrats who are feverishly trying to show they can raise big money and realistically challenge Republican President Donald Trump. With the first-quarter fundraising deadline looming, some are straining credulity to give the impression of a spontaneous groundswell of support.\nIn addition to Inslee and Hickenlooper, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and California Sen. Kamala Harris have boasted they raised $1 million or more in the hours and days after launching their campaigns.\nWhat that signifies is less clear.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange goal post for viability, and there are a lot of tricks you can use to come up with that number,\u201d said Tim Lim, a Democratic strategist who worked for Hillary Clinton\u2019s and Barack Obama\u2019s campaigns.

O\u2019Rourke announced on Monday that he edged Sanders by pulling in $6.1 million in the 24 hours after his launch.\nBut a wide range of tools are available to help the lesser-known White House hopefuls.\nThey include rented fundraisings email lists, targeted social media ads (which all candidates use) and revenue sharing agreements, which allow interest groups to raise money for their own causes while splitting it with a favorite candidate. Fundraising commitments are often lined up in advance, while creative accounting maneuvers can be used to pad the bottom line.\nSenators have a leg up. They can take money from existing federal campaign accounts, while governors are largely barred from doing the same with their state accounts.\nBefore his early March launch, Inslee spent months running targeted ads that asked Facebook users to fork over their email addresses to join his fight against climate change \u2014 now the signature issue of his campaign.

McCraw, vice president and deputy general counsel for The New York Times, which initiated the request for the documents, said he is hopeful Pauley will approve the release of additional materials in May after the government updates the judge on its investigation.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nThe Western Journal has not reviewed this Associated Press story prior to publication.

The Trump administration said the government should have the power to detain such immigrants anytime,\u201d the news outlet added.\nMony Preap, one of the lead plaintiffs in the class action suit against the government, is a lawful permanent resident who had two drug convictions, which were deportable offenses.\nHe completed his jail time for these crimes in 2006 but was detained by federal authorities in 2013 after being released from jail for non-deportable offenses.\nJustice Stephen Breyer said in the dissent \u2014 in which he was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 that the Constitution did not intend for people who have already served their sentence for crimes committed to be deprived of their liberty indefinitely.\n\u201cI would have thought that Congress meant to adhere to these values and did not intend to allow the Government to apprehend persons years after their release from prison and hold them indefinitely without a bail hearing,\u201d he said reading his dissent from the bench, the Washington Examiner reported.\nBreyer warned the \u201cgreater importance in the case lies in the power that the majority\u2019s interpretation grants to the government.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a power to detain persons who committed a minor crime many years before. And it is a power to hold those persons, perhaps for many months, without any opportunity to obtain bail,\u201d he said.\nCecilia Wang, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, who argued the case for the immigrants, said, \u201cthe Supreme Court has endorsed the most extreme interpretation of immigration detention statutes, allowing mass incarceration of people without any hearing, simply because they are defending themselves against a deportation charge.\u201d\nJudicial Watch president Tom Fitton applauded the decision, saying the Supreme Court upheld the rule of law.\nU.S. Supreme Court gives @RealDonaldTrump victory on immigration detention. Actually, court upholds rule of law on immigration in case dating back to Obama administration. https://t.co/zl5h7pH9yJ\n\u2014 Tom Fitton (@TomFitton) March 19, 2019\nHe tweeted, \u201cU.S. Supreme Court gives @RealDonaldTrump victory on immigration detention.

She&rsquo;s awfully fond of telling us that.</p>\n<p>If I know anything about Ocasio-Cortez, it&rsquo;s that a) she&rsquo;s the author of the Green New Deal, b) <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/way-works-james-woods-tweet-aoc-may-go-best-ever/\">she&rsquo;s the boss</a> and c) she&rsquo;s from the <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/fact-check-scorns-girl-bronx-socialist-icon-grew-up-8th-wealthiest-county/\">Bronx</a>.</p>\n<p>Except nobody really seems to have seen her there anytime lately, at least according to a report published Saturday by the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/02/23/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-nowhere-to-be-seen-near-bronx-home/\">New York Post</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She may be America&rsquo;s most famous freshman congresswoman, but in New York, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a virtual ghost,&rdquo; the Post reported.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She has no district office and no local phone number, unlike the state&rsquo;s three other freshman members.</p>\n<figure><video height=\"471\" src=\"https://mcd-fl.playbuzz.com/video/upload/v1490095101/landscape08524089-b844-4322-8e93-471fc2eb19ab_1580953117099.mp4\" width=\"836\"></video></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s unclear whether the 29-year-old lawmaker, who represents the Bronx and Queens, actually still lives in the Parkchester neighborhood that has been so closely tied to her rise &mdash; even though she won her upset victory over fellow Democrat Rep. Joe Crowley with accusations that his home in Virginia made him too Washington-focused to serve his district.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ocasio-Cortez had claimed her deceased father&rsquo;s condo in Parkchester as her residence since 2012, but the Post couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence she actually spent very much time there.</p>\n<p>Her next-door neighbor claims to have never laid eyes upon her, at least not in the building. Several local businesses, including the local supermarket, say they&rsquo;ve never seen her, either. People at a local taqueria actually say that they&rsquo;ve seen her &mdash; but only when she&rsquo;s taking photos for the press.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A postal worker who delivers mail to the building said that in the last 10 years, he has only seen Ocasio-Cortez intermittently, and that several months&rsquo; worth of mail regularly accumulates in the mailbox before anyone bothers to collect it. The worker said that Ocasio-Cortez and (boyfriend Riley) Roberts were the only ones getting mail at the address,&rdquo; the Post reported.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just because their names are on the box doesn&rsquo;t mean they live there,&rdquo; he told the Post.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/02/24/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-confirms-she-moved-to-new-bronx-apartment/\">follow-up story</a> published Sunday, the Post reported that Ocasio-Cortez spokesman Corbin Trent said she had moved to a new apartment &ldquo;a block and a half away.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He declined to give the address.</p>\n<p>In a Twitter post published Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez cited<a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/ap-feds-coast-guard-lieutenant-compiled-hit-list-of-lawmakers/\"> the arrest last week</a> of a Coast Guard lieutenant accused of compiling weapons and a &ldquo;hit list&rdquo; of prominent Democrats, including Ocasio-Cortez, as a reason to keep her location information under wraps.</p>\n<blockquote data-lang=\"en\"> <p>I still live in my hood and literally instagrammed from my apartment tonight.

Sorry!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Regardless, since Trent said the move took place earlier this month, it doesn&rsquo;t explain why Ocasio-Cortez alleged neighbors haven&rsquo;t seen her around for years.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time questions have arisen about the Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo; residency &mdash; she&rsquo;s apparently even had them herself. The Post noted that she had actually filed paperwork to run in the neighboring congressional district, New York District 15, before she got the right one. That&rsquo;s an error Joe Crowley probably wishes would have gone uncorrected.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s also the fact that Ocasio-Cortez has yet to open up a local district office, a fact that she blames on the landlord for her predecessor attempting to double the price of the lease.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s actually not much that can be done so long as Ocasio-Cortez actually lives in the state.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what the <a href=\"https://www.annenbergclassroom.org/article-i-section-2/\">Constitution</a> says about requirements for serving in the House of Representatives: &ldquo;No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, <strong>and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen</strong>.&rdquo; (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/04/21/at-least-20-members-of-the-house-are-registered-to-vote-outside-their-districts/?utm_term=.f4181fcbb876\">The Washington Post</a> reported in June 2017 that during the last Congress, it could find at least 21 representatives who were registered to vote outside their district.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s not entirely the point, though: <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/ocasio-cortez-plays-sexism-card-defending-motherf-er-comment/\">The Bronx</a> address has added to the Ocasio-Cortez mythos. She&rsquo;s a woman of the people, one of the Bronx&rsquo;s own. Until she&rsquo;s not, of course. And, according to the Post, she&rsquo;s gone to cartoonish lengths to conceal any information about where she might actually live when she&rsquo;s in New York.</p>\n<p>The Post contacted the representative&rsquo;s office with specific questions, including where she lived. Her staffers originally said they wouldn&rsquo;t be commenting, but they appeared to change their mind.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;On Saturday night, a staffer promised a Post reporter that Ocasio-Cortez would talk to him after a speaking event in Corona,&rdquo; the Post reported.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;During the event, two staffers were seen reading an early edition of this story on their phones.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Come downstairs, I have to take a picture quick,&rsquo; the congresswoman then told the reporter after the event, instructing him to wait for her. Twenty minutes later, she ducked out a back door, jumped into a chauffeured SUV, and zoomed off.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>To the Bronx, one presumes.</p>\n<p>We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

                "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is from the Bronx? Did you know that? She\u2019s awfully fond of telling us that.\nIf I know anything about Ocasio-Cortez, it\u2019s that a) she\u2019s the author of the Green New Deal, b) she\u2019s the boss and c) she\u2019s from the Bronx.\nExcept nobody really seems to have seen her there anytime lately, at least according to a report published Saturday by the New York Post.\n\u201cShe may be America\u2019s most famous freshman congresswoman, but in New York, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a virtual ghost,\u201d the Post reported.\n\u201cShe has no district office and no local phone number, unlike the state\u2019s three other freshman members.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s unclear whether the 29-year-old lawmaker, who represents the Bronx and Queens, actually still lives in the Parkchester neighborhood that has been so closely tied to her rise \u2014 even though she won her upset victory over fellow Democrat Rep. Joe Crowley with accusations that his home in Virginia made him too Washington-focused to serve his district.\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez had claimed her deceased father\u2019s condo in Parkchester as her residence since 2012, but the Post couldn\u2019t find any evidence she actually spent very much time there.\nHer next-door neighbor claims to have never laid eyes upon her, at least not in the building. Several local businesses, including the local supermarket, say they\u2019ve never seen her, either. People at a local taqueria actually say that they\u2019ve seen her \u2014 but only when she\u2019s taking photos for the press.\n\u201cA postal worker who delivers mail to the building said that in the last 10 years, he has only seen Ocasio-Cortez intermittently, and that several months\u2019 worth of mail regularly accumulates in the mailbox before anyone bothers to collect it. The worker said that Ocasio-Cortez and (boyfriend Riley) Roberts were the only ones getting mail at the address,\u201d the Post reported.\n\u201cJust because their names are on the box doesn\u2019t mean they live there,\u201d he told the Post.\nIn a follow-up story published Sunday, the Post reported that Ocasio-Cortez spokesman Corbin Trent said she had moved to a new apartment \u201ca block and a half away.\u201d\nHe declined to give the address.\nIn a Twitter post published Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez cited the arrest last week of a Coast Guard lieutenant accused of compiling weapons and a \u201chit list\u201d of prominent Democrats, including Ocasio-Cortez, as a reason to keep her location information under wraps.\nI still live in my hood and literally instagrammed from my apartment tonight. A man was just arrested last week with a stockpile of guns specifically trying to kill me & others, so yeah I\u2019m not gonna disclose my personal address or tell people when I move. Sorry!\n\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 25, 2019\n\u201cI still live in my hood and literally instagrammed from my apartment tonight,\u201d she wrote. \u201cA man was just arrested last week with a stockpile of guns specifically trying to kill me & others, so yeah I\u2019m not gonna disclose my personal address or tell people when I move. Sorry!\u201d\nRegardless, since Trent said the move took place earlier this month, it doesn\u2019t explain why Ocasio-Cortez alleged neighbors haven\u2019t seen her around for years.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time questions have arisen about the Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 residency \u2014 she\u2019s apparently even had them herself. The Post noted that she had actually filed paperwork to run in the neighboring congressional district, New York District 15, before she got the right one. That\u2019s an error Joe Crowley probably wishes would have gone uncorrected.\nThere\u2019s also the fact that Ocasio-Cortez has yet to open up a local district office, a fact that she blames on the landlord for her predecessor attempting to double the price of the lease.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s actually not much that can be done so long as Ocasio-Cortez actually lives in the state.\nHere\u2019s what the Constitution says about requirements for serving in the House of Representatives: \u201cNo Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nIn fact, The Washington Post reported in June 2017 that during the last Congress, it could find at least 21 representatives who were registered to vote outside their district.\nThat\u2019s not entirely the point, though: The Bronx address has added to the Ocasio-Cortez mythos. She\u2019s a woman of the people, one of the Bronx\u2019s own. Until she\u2019s not, of course. And, according to the Post, she\u2019s gone to cartoonish lengths to conceal any information about where she might actually live when she\u2019s in New York.\nThe Post contacted the representative\u2019s office with specific questions, including where she lived. Her staffers originally said they wouldn\u2019t be commenting, but they appeared to change their mind.\n\u201cOn Saturday night, a staffer promised a Post reporter that Ocasio-Cortez would talk to him after a speaking event in Corona,\u201d the Post reported.\n\u201cDuring the event, two staffers were seen reading an early edition of this story on their phones.\n\u201c\u2019Come downstairs, I have to take a picture quick,\u2019 the congresswoman then told the reporter after the event, instructing him to wait for her. Twenty minutes later, she ducked out a back door, jumped into a chauffeured SUV, and zoomed off.\u201d\nTo the Bronx, one presumes.\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

I believe in the cause. I believe in our president,&rdquo; said Kina Davis, a Maryland farm owner who donated the use of the horses ridden by the cowboys.</p>\n<p>Others donated as well. Some $18,000 was raised via GoFundMe to allow dozens of supporters to fly out from border states to make the symbolic ride on behalf of pro-Trump voices.</p>\n<p>One of them is Wolf Portugal, a Native American who told WTOP that he believes his ancestors would have supported a security wall as well.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I can safely say if the Native American Indian could build walls, they would have built them,&rdquo; he declared.</p>\n<p><strong>RELATED:</strong> <a data-type=\"Internal link\" data-type-location=\"in-content-related\" href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/midst-iowa-debacle-chris-matthews-thinks-even-adam-schiff-2020-nominee/\">In Midst of Iowa Debacle, Chris Matthews Thinks Even Adam Schiff Could Be 2020 Nominee</a></p>\n<p>Contrary to the frequent portrayal of Trump supporters in the media, organizers said they weren&rsquo;t anti-immigrant, but simply wanted the laws followed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We want to welcome immigrants to come into our country, but they have to go through the legal processes,&rdquo; said Griffin, who helped organize the event.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We rode through some pretty severe weather, as far as snow and ice.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump is known for his <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/hs-student-takes-bold-stand-school-wont-let-wear-maga-hat/\">now-iconic campaign hats</a>, and the &ldquo;Cowboys for Trump&rdquo; decided to bring him one with a unique design. One member of the group made a custom cowboy hat for the commander in chief, although they have not yet been able to give it to him personally.</p>\n<p>Whether Trump ultimately prevails in his emergency border declaration and inevitable court challenges remains to be seen, but the fact that supporters are so fired up over illegal immigration shows that the issue isn&rsquo;t going away any time soon.</p>\n<p>The president won largely by promising to fix the border crisis. That&rsquo;s proving to be easier said than done, but underestimating him or his grassroots supporters&rsquo; dedication to the wall would probably be a losing bet.</p>\n<p>We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

                "text": "Washington, D.C., may be a long way away from the Wild West, but two dozen real-life wranglers just brought the cowboy spirit to the nation\u2019s capital.\nIn a demonstration to show support for President Donald Trump and raise awareness for the border security issue, a group of conservatives completed a week-long horseback ride through winter weather to march \u2014 or is that clop? \u2014 to the White House from the historic Cumberland area of Maryland.\n\u201cFriday\u2019s arrival concluded an eight-day ride from Cumberland, Maryland, that began on Feb. 15, the same day President Donald Trump declared a national emergency along the U.S.-Mexico border,\u201d reported WTOP Radio in Washington.\n\u201cThe start day wasn\u2019t a coincidence for the group: They decided to depart the day of the announcement to support Trump\u2019s decision,\u201d the station explained.\nCarrying American flags and blue Trump banners, the riders covered about 25 miles per day along the C&O Canal towpath for much of their journey, braving cold temperatures to travel through a part of the country once surveyed by George Washington himself.\nThe aptly named \u201cCowboys for Trump\u201d was organized by Couy Griffin, a resident of New Mexico who says he\u2019s seen the problems with the unsecured southern border firsthand.\n\u201cWe\u2019re directly affected in New Mexico by the border situation,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe support the president through the actions that he\u2019s taken as far as securing our border.\u201d\nMany establishment media outlets and of course politicians on the left have insisted that Trump is low on support for his emergency declaration, which takes pre-appropriated funds and redirects them to boost security along U.S.-Mexico problem areas.\nBut the dedication of supporters like Griffin suggests that the president may have grassroots backing for his plan.\n\u201cI am just out here to support the Cowboys for Trump. I believe in the cause. I believe in our president,\u201d said Kina Davis, a Maryland farm owner who donated the use of the horses ridden by the cowboys.\nOthers donated as well. Some $18,000 was raised via GoFundMe to allow dozens of supporters to fly out from border states to make the symbolic ride on behalf of pro-Trump voices.\nOne of them is Wolf Portugal, a Native American who told WTOP that he believes his ancestors would have supported a security wall as well.\n\u201cI can safely say if the Native American Indian could build walls, they would have built them,\u201d he declared.\nRELATED: In Midst of Iowa Debacle, Chris Matthews Thinks Even Adam Schiff Could Be 2020 Nominee\nContrary to the frequent portrayal of Trump supporters in the media, organizers said they weren\u2019t anti-immigrant, but simply wanted the laws followed.\n\u201cWe want to welcome immigrants to come into our country, but they have to go through the legal processes,\u201d said Griffin, who helped organize the event.\n\u201cWe rode through some pretty severe weather, as far as snow and ice.\u201d\nTrump is known for his now-iconic campaign hats, and the \u201cCowboys for Trump\u201d decided to bring him one with a unique design. One member of the group made a custom cowboy hat for the commander in chief, although they have not yet been able to give it to him personally.\nWhether Trump ultimately prevails in his emergency border declaration and inevitable court challenges remains to be seen, but the fact that supporters are so fired up over illegal immigration shows that the issue isn\u2019t going away any time soon.\nThe president won largely by promising to fix the border crisis. That\u2019s proving to be easier said than done, but underestimating him or his grassroots supporters\u2019 dedication to the wall would probably be a losing bet.\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

Big crowd expected! #MAGA&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The rally in Wisconsin was scheduled to be held at the same time on the same date as the annual Correspondents&rsquo; Dinner, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-campaign-announces-wisconsin-rally-on-night-of-correspondents-dinner\">Fox News</a> reported.</p>\n<p>Michael Glassner, chief operating officer of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., said in a statement, &ldquo;President Trump looks forward to sharing the successes of his administration with the great people of Wisconsin.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Under President Trump&rsquo;s leadership, paychecks are now growing twice as fast for those in the bottom half of the income spectrum. Unemployment has hit generational lows, and the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will open Canadian dairy markets to farmers all across Wisconsin,&rdquo; Glassner added.</p>\n<p>Fox News pointed out that presidents usually attend the annual event &mdash; Trump had even attended in the past prior to his presidency &mdash; but Trump has bucked that tradition since being in office, in large part because of the <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/cbss-lara-logan-bravely-calls-establishment-media-bias-interview-professional-suicide/\">exceptional vitriol and biased hatefulness</a> so many in the liberal media have aimed his direction.</p>\n<p>Ironically, in light of assertions that the president is a billionaire elitist who is out of touch with the American people, Trump will be spending the evening of April 27 surrounded by regular working-class Americans while the elitist media and their billionaire enablers gather together in Washington D.C. to pat themselves on the back and grant each other <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/ny-press-club-throws-standards-window-laughable-honor-jim-acosta/\">awards for their fake news</a>.</p>\n<p>As for those attending the once-prestigious, now-pretentious dinner, they&rsquo;ll be fine without the attendance of the president, and will no doubt take plenty of shots at him in absentia.</p>\n<p>This time, however, the event will be hosted by an author and historian of journalism &mdash; rather than a <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/comedian-called-trump-nazi-wh-correspondents-dinner-cant-figure-isnt-going/\">crass comedian</a> &mdash; so hopefully, the current denizens of the biased liberal media can learn something about the glory days of journalism with integrity &hellip; though we won&rsquo;t be holding our breath in that regard.</p>\n<p>Highlighting the expected self-righteous sanctimony of the media that will be on display at the event, White House Correspondents&rsquo; Association president Olivier Knox <a href=\"  https://twitter.com/whca/status/1114194418846715904  \">said in a tweet</a> that his organization was &ldquo;looking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the First Amendment and great journalists past, present, and future.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote data-lang=\"en\"> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WHCA?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WHCA</a> President Olivier Knox on President Trump&rsquo;s decision not to attend the association&rsquo;s annual dinner April 27. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the First Amendment and great journalists past, present, and future.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OKnox\">@OKnox</a></p> <p>&mdash; WHCA (@whca) <a href=\"  https://twitter.com/whca/status/1114194418846715904  \">April 5, 2019</a></p> </blockquote>\n<p>As an aside, the choice of Wisconsin as the location for Trump&rsquo;s rally is something of a subtle dig at his failed 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her defenders in the media, as the defeated candidate lost in part because she failed to visit and rally sufficient support in many Midwestern states, Wisconsin in particular.</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that Democrats will make that same mistake again, so President Trump has gotten a jump-start in staking out that state as one he fully intends to win.</p>\n<p>Fox News noted that Trump has already visited Wisconsin no less than 18 times &mdash; Green Bay specifically three times &mdash; since June of 2018, and there will surely be plenty more visits to that state and others in the year and months leading up to the 2020 election.</p>\n<p>We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

                "text": "President Donald Trump revealed on April 5 that he would be skipping the upcoming annual White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner for the third year in a row since taking office and would hold a rally with supporters instead.\nThat decision wasn\u2019t particularly surprising, given the overtly hostile environment the annual dinner \u2014 which is little more than a self-congratulatory celebration of the establishment media by the media \u2014 has become with regard to him and his administration in recent years.\nIn dismissing the idea of attending this year\u2019s Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, Trump called the event \u201cboring\u201d and negative,\u201d and told reporters that he\u2019d rather be in a \u201cpositive\u201d setting, such as a rally with his supporters.\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 dinner was so boring this year- I guess that\u2019s because I didn\u2019t attend(even\u2026 http://t.co/8jD8GuFluU\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 29, 2013\nTrump finally revealed in a tweet on Tuesday where that rally would be and wrote, \u201cI will be in Green Bay, Wisconsin on Saturday, April 27th at the Resch Center \u2014 7:00 pm (CDT). Big crowd expected! #MAGA\u201d\nThe rally in Wisconsin was scheduled to be held at the same time on the same date as the annual Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, Fox News reported.\nMichael Glassner, chief operating officer of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., said in a statement, \u201cPresident Trump looks forward to sharing the successes of his administration with the great people of Wisconsin.\u201d\n\u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, paychecks are now growing twice as fast for those in the bottom half of the income spectrum. Unemployment has hit generational lows, and the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will open Canadian dairy markets to farmers all across Wisconsin,\u201d Glassner added.\nFox News pointed out that presidents usually attend the annual event \u2014 Trump had even attended in the past prior to his presidency \u2014 but Trump has bucked that tradition since being in office, in large part because of the exceptional vitriol and biased hatefulness so many in the liberal media have aimed his direction.\nIronically, in light of assertions that the president is a billionaire elitist who is out of touch with the American people, Trump will be spending the evening of April 27 surrounded by regular working-class Americans while the elitist media and their billionaire enablers gather together in Washington D.C. to pat themselves on the back and grant each other awards for their fake news.\nAs for those attending the once-prestigious, now-pretentious dinner, they\u2019ll be fine without the attendance of the president, and will no doubt take plenty of shots at him in absentia.\nThis time, however, the event will be hosted by an author and historian of journalism \u2014 rather than a crass comedian \u2014 so hopefully, the current denizens of the biased liberal media can learn something about the glory days of journalism with integrity \u2026 though we won\u2019t be holding our breath in that regard.\nHighlighting the expected self-righteous sanctimony of the media that will be on display at the event, White House Correspondents\u2019 Association president Olivier Knox said in a tweet that his organization was \u201clooking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the First Amendment and great journalists past, present, and future.\u201d\n#WHCA President Olivier Knox on President Trump\u2019s decision not to attend the association\u2019s annual dinner April 27. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the First Amendment and great journalists past, present, and future.\u201d @OKnox\n\u2014 WHCA (@whca) April 5, 2019\nAs an aside, the choice of Wisconsin as the location for Trump\u2019s rally is something of a subtle dig at his failed 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her defenders in the media, as the defeated candidate lost in part because she failed to visit and rally sufficient support in many Midwestern states, Wisconsin in particular.\nIt is unlikely that Democrats will make that same mistake again, so President Trump has gotten a jump-start in staking out that state as one he fully intends to win.\nFox News noted that Trump has already visited Wisconsin no less than 18 times \u2014 Green Bay specifically three times \u2014 since June of 2018, and there will surely be plenty more visits to that state and others in the year and months leading up to the 2020 election.\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

Jared Polis, a Democrat, said Sunday that he will sign a law passed by Colorado lawmakers that would add Colorado to the states pledging to award their electoral votes to the candidate with the highest popular vote total.\nPolis called the Electoral College an \u201cundemocratic relic\u201d of the past, The Hill reported.\nHis comment somewhat echoes criticism of the Electoral College leveled by Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.\n\u201cIt is well past time we eliminate the Electoral College, a shadow of slavery\u2019s power on America today that undermines our nation as a democratic republic,\u201d she tweeted last fall.\nTRENDING: O'Keefe Finds New Evidence That Sanders Is Paying Violent Communist, Twitter Bans Him for It\nIt is well past time we eliminate the Electoral College, a shadow of slavery\u2019s power on America today that undermines our nation as a democratic republic. https://t.co/00HZN3MI6F\n\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 6, 2018\nIn line with that thinking, Democrats have introduced a constitutional amendment that would abolish the Electoral College.\nPolis said the presidential election should be simple.\n\u201cI\u2019ve long supported electing the president by who gets the most votes,\u201d Polis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to move towards direct election of the president.\u201d\nRepublican state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg saw things differently and told NPR that candidates would flock to major media markets in New York and Los Angeles.\n\u201cYou drop us from nine (electoral) votes to 5.5 million people, all of sudden Colorado is irrelevant,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is all about making sure presidential candidates realize Colorado is important to the rest of the country.\u201d\nSo far, 11 other states have approved similar measures. Collectively, the states total 172 electoral votes.\nThe agreement among the states says that it takes effect when partner states have at least 270 electoral votes in all, the number needed to elect a president.\nRELATED: 'The View' Co-Host Navarro Says US Is Ready for a Woman President Because One's 'Already Been Elected'\nProponents of awarding the presidency based on the popular vote say that too much attention gets paid to swing states, and this would right the balance.\n\u201cUnder a national popular vote, the 38 non-battleground states long ignored by presidential campaigns will be powerful again, because no candidate can win 270 electoral votes and the White House without also winning the popular vote across all 50 states and the District of Columbia,\u201d said John Koza, chairman of National Popular Vote.\nPresident Donald Trump has said that the popular vote is actually simpler for a campaign than the current system.\n\u201cThe popular vote would be much easier to win if you were campaigning on it. You know, it\u2019s like running the 100-yard dash versus a 10-mile run. You train differently. Nobody explained that to Hillary Clinton, by the way,\u201d Trump told The Associated Press in October.\nCalls for changing how America votes have been debated off and on for years but gained new traction after the 2016 presidential election in which Democrat Hillary Clinton received 65,853,516 votes against 62,984,825 for Trump, according to the Federal Election Commission.\nThose totals gave Clinton roughly a 2.9 million popular vote edge.\nHowever, those totals mask the fact that two states \u2014 both of which support the national popular vote project \u2014 alone vastly increased Clinton\u2019s totals.\nIn California, Clinton topped Trump 8.75 million votes to 4.48 million votes, while in New York, Clinton received 4.55 million votes against 2.82 million for Trump.\nClinton\u2019s 4.27 million vote margin in California and her 1.73 million vote margin in New York gave her a 6 million vote margin over Trump in those two states.\nThus, Clinton trailed Trump in the other 48 states by 3.1 million popular votes.\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

It assigns states a given number of electors based on population.\nIn a presidential election, voters choose electors pledged to vote for one of the candidates.\nCalls to eliminate the Electoral College emerged after President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nClinton received 65,853,516 votes against 62,984,825 for Trump, according to the Federal Election Commission \u2014 roughly a 2.9 million popular vote edge.\nHowever, those totals mask the fact that two states alone vastly increased Clinton\u2019s totals. In California, Clinton topped Trump 8.75 million votes to 4.48 million votes. In New York, Clinton received 4.55 million votes against 2.82 million for Trump.\nHer 4.27 million vote margin in California and her 1.73 million vote margin in New York gave the former secretary of state a 6 million vote margin over Trump in those two states. That margin means that in the other 48 states, Clinton trailed Trump by 3.1 million votes.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has called for a \u201creassessment\u201d of the Electoral College, according to The Hill. High-profile leftists from Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to former ESPN host Jemele Hill have also trashed the Electoral College.\nNah. People who live in cities that truly represent the diversity of America should set the course. The electoral college is outdated, and was there to preserve slavery. We need to move on. https://t.co/vRykoYcPle\n\u2014 Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) March 18, 2019\nDemocratic-led states have been calling for changes in how presidents are elected, and 12 states are on board through the National Popular Vote effort.\n\u201cUnder a national popular vote, the 38 non-battleground states long ignored by presidential campaigns will be powerful again, because no candidate can win 270 electoral votes and the White House without also winning the popular vote across all 50 states and the District of Columbia,\u201d said John Koza, chairman of National Popular Vote, according to The Hill.\nTara Ross, author of \u201cThe Indispensable Electoral College: How the Founders\u2019 Plan Saves Our Country from Mob Rule,\u201d countered that argument in an Op-Ed for Inside Sources.\n\u201cFirst, small to mid-size states can never receive equal treatment under a national popular vote system,\u201d Ross wrote. \u201cHow can they? Candidates have limited time and resources. They will not work to build support across state and regional lines without an Electoral College to force the subject.\n\u201cConsider that Hillary Clinton won fully 20 percent of her individual votes from only two states: New York and California. The mistake cost her the election. But without the Electoral College, she would be rewarded for such behavior, and candidates would be sure to double down on the strategy. New Hampshire, Wyoming and other small-population states would easily be lost in the shuffle.\u201d\n\u201cAgain and again, the Founders went to great lengths to thwart blind majority rule, not wanting important national decisions to be driven by unbridled public emotion, populist demagoguery, or the passions of the mob \u201d https://t.co/fKsvNK43Es\n\u2014 Michael A. Maynard (@mmaynard119) March 19, 2019\nTrump has said he still would have beaten Clinton under a national popular vote system.\n\u201cThe popular vote would be much easier to win if you were campaigning on it,\u201d the president told The Associated Press in October. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s like running the 100-yard dash versus a 10-mile run. You train differently. Nobody explained that to Hillary Clinton, by the way.\u201d\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism. Read our editorial standards.",

We must respect our flag at ALL times.\u201d\nBoston WCVB-TV news anchor Doug Meehan was more direct, tweeting, \u201cHey \u2013 whoever is at the Boston marathon finish line \u2013 pick the American flag up off the ground!\u201d\nSeeing this American flag on the ground at the Boston Marathon yesterday is just terrible.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York failed to learn a key lesson from high school civics class: \u201cWe the people\u201d are the boss of Congress.\nThe Democratic lawmaker dismissed the detractors of her Green New Deal plan, while being interviewed at a \u201cGirls Who Code\u201d event in New York City on Friday, the Washington Examiner reported.\n\u201cThe power is in the person who\u2019s trying, regardless of the success,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying, you\u2019ve got all the power. You\u2019re driving the agenda.\u201d\nSocialist on an ego-trip. How long before she puts on a uniform with a dozen medals? pic.twitter.com/bpVisJRzZy\n\u2014 Jack Posobiec \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JackPosobiec) February 24, 2019\n\u201cLike I just introduced the Green New Deal two weeks ago, and it\u2019s creating all of this conversation. Why? Because no one else has even tried,\u201d she continued.\n\u201cSo people are like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s unrealistic. Oh, it\u2019s vague. Oh, it doesn\u2019t address this little minute thing,\u2019\u201d the congresswoman continued. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018You try. You do it. Cuz you\u2019re not. Cuz you\u2019re not. So, until you do it, I\u2019m the boss.\u2019 How about that?\u2019\u201d\nPearson responded in a video posted on Twitter, \u201cYou are no one\u2019s boss.\u201d\n\u201cAmerica is a government for the people and by the people,\u201d the young man explained. \u201cSo if anyone is the boss, it is we the people.\u201d\nHe went on to point out that the only reason she gets paid a salary and carries the title \u201ccongresswoman\u201d is because of the American taxpayer.\n\u201cAnd to listen to you, drunk on power, as you sat on that stage, was nothing more than an affront to the office that you hold and an affront to the role of public servant that you have in our society,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo citizen, no voter, none of us work for you,\u201d Pearson observed. \u201cYou are no one\u2019s boss. Okay?\u201d\n\u201cInstead of getting mad at people for trashing your bad ideas, here\u2019s an idea: come up with better ones.\u201d\nA few weeks, one of @AOC buddies in Congress said fhat I should be \u201cafraid of her\u201d. Now, @AOC is calling herself the \u201cboss\u201d.\nCongresswoman \u2013 here\u2019s a lesson you should have learned in HS civics: America is a nation for the people by the people.\nWE THE PEOPLE are YOUR boss. pic.twitter.com/oGFXxp05Qp\n\u2014 CJ Pearson (@thecjpearson) February 24, 2019\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s resolution, which she co-authored with Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, calls for \u201ca new national social, industrial and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal.\u201d\nIts stated goals include transitioning the United States to 100 percent renewable energy and guaranteeing economic security to all its citizens.\nTo achieve to net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2030, the Green New Deal mandates the replacement of airplanes with high-speed trains, the rebuilding or retrofitting of all buildings in the country to new green standards, and the elimination of all combustion-engine vehicles.\nOcasio-Cortez also included some of her favorite government social programs in the resolution such as free universal healthcare and college education, government guaranteed employment, and paid family and medical leave, among other programs.\nNoah Smith, writing for Bloomberg, tallied up the Green New Deal\u2019s costs \u2014 including its new proposed entitlement programs \u2014 to be about $6.6 trillion per year beyond the nation\u2019s current spending.\nBy way of comparison, the government is projected to spend $4.4 trillion total during the 2019 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\nEarlier this month, Pearson called out Ocasio-Cortez for talking throughout President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address.\n\u201c.@AOC has been talking this entire speech and the woman next to her keeps trying to look the other way,\u201d he tweeted.\nRep.

                "html": "<p>The conservative student organization Turning Point USA hosted the Young Latino Leadership Summit over the weekend in Phoenix, Arizona, promoting the values of free-market capitalism, American exceptionalism, and national sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Turning Point USA founder and president Charlie Kirk told <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK1n1psJpd8\">The Western Journal</a> that the event was the group&rsquo;s largest gathering of its type to date (it has previously hosted four such summits) and, to his knowledge, represented the largest gathering of conservative Latino students ever.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just the gathering itself is a success, but we want to make sure everyone leaves better connected and better trained,&rdquo; Kirk said of the 300 who attended. &ldquo;Better trained on how to debate their values and principles.&rdquo;</p>\n<p> <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"> <figure><video><source src=\"https://v.connatix.com/20eb57ac-eaee-41aa-9e1e-605fd4d84eb6/1_360_4.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=hevc\"></source></video></figure></a>   </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/20eb57ac-eaee-41aa-9e1e-605fd4d84eb6/1.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=362&width=644\"></img></figure>\n<p>Those values, he said, include the belief that &ldquo;America is the greatest country,&rdquo; as well as the importance of &ldquo;strong borders, national sovereignty, and the rule of law.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote data-lang=\"en\"> <p>They say we don&rsquo;t exist.</p> <p>They lied. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ylls2019?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ylls2019</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://t.co/0or53KU8ca\">pic.twitter.com/0or53KU8ca</a></p> <p>&mdash; Anna Paulina (@realannapaulina) <a href=\" https://twitter.com/realannapaulina/status/1099470549791592448 \">February 24, 2019</a></p> </blockquote>\n<p>Among the <a href=\"https://www.tpusa.com/ylls\">speakers</a> at the three-day event were former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle; investigative reporter and frequent guest on FNC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hannity&rdquo; Sara Carter; Steve Cortes, CNN commentator and member of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s Hispanic Advisory Council; Border Patrol spokesman Art Del Cueto; and My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell.</p>\n<blockquote data-lang=\"en\"> <p>Thank you for having me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TPUSA\">@TPUSA</a> at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/YLLS2019?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#YLLS2019</a></p> <p>This amazing group of young people is the future of this country! <a href=\"https://t.co/o0MJNmQQ3r\">pic.twitter.com/o0MJNmQQ3r</a></p> <p>&mdash; Sara A. Carter (@SaraCarterDC) <a href=\" https://twitter.com/SaraCarterDC/status/1099372307737276416 \">February 23, 2019</a></p> </blockquote>\n<p>David Basulto and Jesse Holguin, co-founders of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LEXITMovement/\">LEXIT Movement</a>, also spoke at the gathering, bringing the message that traditional Latino values &mdash; pro-life, pro-entrepreneurism, pro-freedom &mdash; are more aligned with conservatism and the Republican Party than modern liberalism.</p>\n<p>LEXIT stands for &ldquo;Latino exit&rdquo; from the Democrats ranks.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who better to reach Latinos than other Latinos?&rdquo; Basulto said to The Western Journal. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just regular Chicanos from the hood, and we support Trump. We want the wall.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Holguin said he used to be a Democrat, but after doing his homework, decided he could not remain in the party.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I put God first above all things, and so does the LEXIT Movement,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Holguin argued that, too often, Latinos have allowed their values to be shaped by biased Spanish-language media, such as Univision and Telemundo, which he said push a CNN-like anti-Trump, anti-conservative agenda.</p>\n<p>The activist also pointed to other influences like schools and universities and Hollywood celebrities all trying to push Hispanics in a liberal direction.</p>\n<p>Basulto agreed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Democrat Party has basically put every race and ethnic group in a little box, and told them, &lsquo;Anyone outside this box is against you and bad for you,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going in there and we&rsquo;re going to kick the door down on that box, and free our people and tell them, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re Americans and everybody in this country, we&rsquo;re all one.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Basulto further argued there is nothing inconsistent with being Latino and against illegal immigration.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You can be for legal immigration and against illegal immigration and not be a race traitor and care about your own people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can be conservative and still love your culture, love your ethnicity and still be for your people and still be a proud American.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Asked what two things he would like to see the conservative movement accomplish between now and the 2020 election, Kirk said that, first, he would like to improve black and Hispanic support, and, second, have conservatives unite behind Trump.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everyone says, &lsquo;most important election, most important election&rsquo;&hellip;this one&rsquo;s pretty important,&rdquo; he contended.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The left hates America,&rdquo; Kirk said. &ldquo;Not all the Democrats do, but the left hates America. And they want to destroy us from within. And if we allow people who hate our country to rule our country, I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll be able to recover from that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

                "text": "The conservative student organization Turning Point USA hosted the Young Latino Leadership Summit over the weekend in Phoenix, Arizona, promoting the values of free-market capitalism, American exceptionalism, and national sovereignty.\nTurning Point USA founder and president Charlie Kirk told The Western Journal that the event was the group\u2019s largest gathering of its type to date (it has previously hosted four such summits) and, to his knowledge, represented the largest gathering of conservative Latino students ever.\n\u201cJust the gathering itself is a success, but we want to make sure everyone leaves better connected and better trained,\u201d Kirk said of the 300 who attended. \u201cBetter trained on how to debate their values and principles.\u201d\nThose values, he said, include the belief that \u201cAmerica is the greatest country,\u201d as well as the importance of \u201cstrong borders, national sovereignty, and the rule of law.\u201d\nThey say we don\u2019t exist.\nThey lied. #ylls2019\npic.twitter.com/0or53KU8ca\n\u2014 Anna Paulina (@realannapaulina) February 24, 2019\nAmong the speakers at the three-day event were former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle; investigative reporter and frequent guest on FNC\u2019s \u201cHannity\u201d Sara Carter; Steve Cortes, CNN commentator and member of President Donald Trump\u2019s Hispanic Advisory Council; Border Patrol spokesman Art Del Cueto; and My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell.\nThank you for having me @TPUSA at the #YLLS2019\nThis amazing group of young people is the future of this country! pic.twitter.com/o0MJNmQQ3r\n\u2014 Sara A. Carter (@SaraCarterDC) February 23, 2019\nDavid Basulto and Jesse Holguin, co-founders of LEXIT Movement, also spoke at the gathering, bringing the message that traditional Latino values \u2014 pro-life, pro-entrepreneurism, pro-freedom \u2014 are more aligned with conservatism and the Republican Party than modern liberalism.\nLEXIT stands for \u201cLatino exit\u201d from the Democrats ranks.\n\u201cWho better to reach Latinos than other Latinos?\u201d Basulto said to The Western Journal. \u201cWe\u2019re just regular Chicanos from the hood, and we support Trump. We want the wall.\u201d\nHolguin said he used to be a Democrat, but after doing his homework, decided he could not remain in the party.\n\u201cI put God first above all things, and so does the LEXIT Movement,\u201d he said.\nHolguin argued that, too often, Latinos have allowed their values to be shaped by biased Spanish-language media, such as Univision and Telemundo, which he said push a CNN-like anti-Trump, anti-conservative agenda.\nThe activist also pointed to other influences like schools and universities and Hollywood celebrities all trying to push Hispanics in a liberal direction.\nBasulto agreed.\n\u201cThe Democrat Party has basically put every race and ethnic group in a little box, and told them, \u2018Anyone outside this box is against you and bad for you,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going in there and we\u2019re going to kick the door down on that box, and free our people and tell them, \u2018You\u2019re Americans and everybody in this country, we\u2019re all one.\u2019\u201d\nBasulto further argued there is nothing inconsistent with being Latino and against illegal immigration.\n\u201cYou can be for legal immigration and against illegal immigration and not be a race traitor and care about your own people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can be conservative and still love your culture, love your ethnicity and still be for your people and still be a proud American.\u201d\nAsked what two things he would like to see the conservative movement accomplish between now and the 2020 election, Kirk said that, first, he would like to improve black and Hispanic support, and, second, have conservatives unite behind Trump.\n\u201cEveryone says, \u2018most important election, most important election\u2019\u2026this one\u2019s pretty important,\u201d he contended.\n\u201cThe left hates America,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cNot all the Democrats do, but the left hates America. And they want to destroy us from within. And if we allow people who hate our country to rule our country, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to recover from that.\u201d\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

If I didn\u2019t do it there would be hell to pay from the FAKE NEWS MEDIA!\u201d he tweeted.\nWhile the press doesn\u2019t like writing about it, nor do I need them to, I donate my yearly Presidential salary of $400,000.00 to different agencies throughout the year, this to Homeland Security.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2019\nTRENDING: O'Keefe Finds New Evidence That Sanders Is Paying Violent Communist, Twitter Bans Him for It\nBefore this latest donation, Trump in January donated part of his 2018 salary to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Trump\u2019s older brother, Fred, suffered from alcohol-related problems and died in 1981 at the age of 43.\nIn the past, the president has donated parts of his salary to government departments including Education, Health and Human Services, Transportation and Veterans Affairs.\nTrump has also donated part of his salary to the National Park Service. That donation was used to help repair buildings and fences at the Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland, The Hill reported.\nMany on Twitter said the gesture shows the difference between Trump and others.\nCindy McCain is worth $100 million but still accepted a $174,000 \u201cdeath gratuity\u201d upon her husband\u2019s death (which we taxpayers bankroll).\nMeanwhile, Trump donated his $400,000 presidential salary to federal agencies. And Ivanka and Jared both forgo their six-figure WH salaries.\n\u2014 Samantha Chang (@samantha_chang) March 17, 2019\nSo @realDonaldTrump (a capitalist) donates his paycheck to DHS but loudmouth AOC (a socialist who wants to tax Americans at 70%) keeps her entire paycheck..\nMoney where your mouth is, babe?\n\u2014 Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) March 19, 2019\nLast fall, Trump donated part of his salary to the Small Business Administration, which said it will be used to help veterans.\n\u201cThis money is going to be used in our veterans program. We\u2019re going to establish a seven-month intensive training program called \u2018Emerging Leaders.\u2019 It\u2019s an adaptation of that program for our veterans, helping them transition from military life into private sector if they desire to start their own jobs and their own companies, and be entrepreneurs,\u201d SBA Administrator Linda McMahon said then, according to a transcript of an Oct. 3 White House briefing.\nIn May, acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie accepted Trump\u2019s donation to the department and said the gesture was a small part of a larger picture, according to a White House briefing transcript from May 17.\n\u201cThe president\u2019s gift underscores his promise to do all that he can for veterans, which includes supporting those who care for our veterans \u2014 not just those of us at VA, but the husbands, the wives, the families, and the community caregivers who are out there day in and day out making life easier for those who have borne the battle,\u201d Wilkie said.\nThe quarterly donations were not part of the initial donation plan, according to a BBC report from 2017.\nIn March 2017, then-White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a briefing that, \u201cThe President\u2019s intention right now is to donate his salary at the end of the year, and he has kindly asked that you all determine where that goes.\u201d\n\u201cIn all seriousness, I think his view is he made a pledge to the American people he wants to donate it to charity and he\u2019d love your help to determine where it should go,\u201d Spicer said then.\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.
