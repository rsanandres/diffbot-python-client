But that&rsquo;s exactly what one celebrity is doing &ndash; against the pro-life movement.</p>\n<p>Actress Alyssa Milano is <a href=\"https://townhall.com/columnists/katieyoder/2019/03/15/20-celebs-join-planned-parenthood-to-bash-trumps-title-x-n2543177\">no stranger</a> to supporting abortion. But, in a new video gone unnoticed by the media, the &lsquo;Charmed&rsquo; actress reveals more of her thoughts about those who oppose abortion: that &ldquo;everyone is f**king pro-life&rdquo; and that restricting abortion &ldquo;stems back to racism.&rdquo; Her comments came during a January interview with SHE Media CEO Samantha Skey at <a href=\"https://www.blogher.com/news/2018/11/8/alyssa-milano-joins-blogher-health-2019\">BlogHer Health 2019</a> &ndash; but the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Ebl-lms6Y\">footage</a> wasn&rsquo;t published online until February 28.</p>\n<p>From the beginning of the video, Milano urged, &ldquo;We can talk about anything.&rdquo; And that she did. When Skey asked her to name a &ldquo;health issue among women,&rdquo; Milano pointed to &ldquo;reproductive freedom,&rdquo; or, rather, abortion.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I refuse to call people that are anti-abortion &lsquo;pro-life,&rsquo; because everyone is f**king pro-life, okay?&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;What they come down to is they&rsquo;re anti-choice. They&rsquo;re taking away our choice.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In other words, abortion supporters&rsquo; labels are accurate, while pro-lifers&rsquo; are incorrect. But Milano&rsquo;s take is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the pro-life movement. Pro-lifers strive to protect and enable each person&rsquo;s choices. The difference is that they include the unborn in their definition of people.</p>\n<p>According to the actress, the abortion debate on the federal and state level was between &ldquo;two very separate belief systems&rdquo;: religion and science.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t separate the fact that they&rsquo;re trying to take away access to birth control and trying to take away access to safe abortions,&rdquo; she said of those who are religious, &ldquo;does that mean they want us to not have sex, are women not worthy of sexual pleasure? Like, what does that mean?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Milano didn&rsquo;t seem aware of groups like <a href=\"https://www.secularprolife.org/\">Secular Pro-Life</a> and <a href=\"https://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2014/03/11/yes-there-are-pro-life-atheists-out-there-heres-why-im-one-of-them/\">Pro-Life Humanists</a> that recognize abortion&rsquo;s violence even though they aren&rsquo;t religious. More generally, the pro-life movement sees science and religion as supporting one another, rather than as in conflict. The 2019 March for Life theme <a href=\"https://townhall.com/columnists/katieyoder/2019/01/18/the-march-for-life-is-also-a-womens-march-n2539246\">stressed</a> science&rsquo;s role in combating abortion, from unveiling the unborn baby&rsquo;s unique DNA at fertilization to its heartbeat at six weeks.</p>\n<p>And, when it comes to birth control, pro-lifers aren&rsquo;t all in agreement. The recent debate by Christians has tried to distinguish between allowing others&rsquo; contraceptive use and having to pay for others&rsquo; contraceptive use. Christian-owned companies like Hobby Lobby made headlines in 2014 because they <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/11/contraception-birth-control-abortion-abortifacients-ella-plan-b-iud-embryo-life/\">didn&rsquo;t want to provide</a> employees with certain kinds because they saw them acting as abortifacients.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the point of the pro-life movement isn&rsquo;t to ban sex &ndash; something sacred &ndash; with a resounding &ldquo;no.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the inherent dignity and life of an unborn baby.</p>\n<p><em><strong>SUPPORT LIFENEWS! To take o n the abortion industry, <a href=\"http://www.lifenews.com/donate/\">please help LifeNews.com with a donation</a>!</strong></em></p>\n<p>Milano overlooked that as she brought up what she called the &ldquo;race issue&rdquo; in abortion.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Rich, white people will always be able to afford and get safe abortion,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So the rights that they&rsquo;re &ndash; they&rsquo;re trying to strip away from us are going to hurt the marginalized and the women that are most at risk, that have very low income, that are not going to be able to, you know, travel to a different state to get a state &ndash; safe abortion.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to be hurt. They&rsquo;re going to try to get an abortion no matter how,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Unfortunately in this country, a lot of it stems back to racism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Milano failed to mention that the pro-life movement supports pregnancy centers that <a href=\"https://townhall.com/columnists/laurettabrown/2018/03/19/these-dc-pregnancy-centers-labeled-fake-by-abortion-groups-are-changing-womens-lives-n2462392\">provide free resources, from housing to education, to help pregnant women</a> in need. That includes Blacks or African-Americans, who accounted for 36 percent of abortions in 2015, according to the<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/ss/ss6713a1.htm\"> CDC</a>&rsquo;s most recent abortion surveillance report.</p>\n<p>But again, Milano&rsquo;s claim touches on another misunderstanding. Legislation restricting abortion isn&rsquo;t an evil plot to target low-income women who aren&rsquo;t white. It stems from acknowledging the intrinsic dignity and respect due to every human person, including minorities, from conception to natural death.</p>\n<p>Milano has a chance at comprehending the pro-life movement though &ndash; if she takes her own advice.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Often we get so caught up in this sort of tribal mentality that we all have to believe the same thing and say the same thing and it&rsquo;s okay to be, to want the same thing, but to go about it in a different way,&rdquo; she told Skey about advancing different movements.</p>\n<p>And, she added of feminism, &ldquo;As white women, if we&rsquo;re not fighting for every woman, we&rsquo;re not going to get this done. We&rsquo;re not going to achieve what we need to achieve.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The pro-life movement <a href=\"https://townhall.com/columnists/katieyoder/2019/01/18/the-march-for-life-is-also-a-womens-march-n2539246\">strives to support, protect, and empower women</a>. But to accomplish that, it cherishes women at every stage in life, including in the womb.</p>\n<p><em>LifeNews Note: Katie Yoder writes for Town Hall, where this column <a href=\"https://townhall.com/columnists/katieyoder/2019/03/19/actress-alyssa-milano-insists-everyone-is-fing-prolife-ok-n2543333\">originally appeared</a>. </em></p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://lifenews-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/alyssamilano2.png\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px\" src=\"https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/alyssamilano2.png\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/alyssamilano2.png 678w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/03/alyssamilano2-150x90.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/03/alyssamilano2-249x150.png 249w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/03/alyssamilano2-190x114.png 190w\"></img></a><figcaption>Share this story:</figcaption></figure>",

                "text": "One of the great tragedies of debate is when an argument is attacked for what others\u2019 think it is, rather than for what it actually represents. But that\u2019s exactly what one celebrity is doing \u2013 against the pro-life movement.\nActress Alyssa Milano is no stranger to supporting abortion. But, in a new video gone unnoticed by the media, the \u2018Charmed\u2019 actress reveals more of her thoughts about those who oppose abortion: that \u201ceveryone is f**king pro-life\u201d and that restricting abortion \u201cstems back to racism.\u201d Her comments came during a January interview with SHE Media CEO Samantha Skey at BlogHer Health 2019 \u2013 but the footage wasn\u2019t published online until February 28.\nFrom the beginning of the video, Milano urged, \u201cWe can talk about anything.\u201d And that she did. When Skey asked her to name a \u201chealth issue among women,\u201d Milano pointed to \u201creproductive freedom,\u201d or, rather, abortion.\n\u201cI refuse to call people that are anti-abortion \u2018pro-life,\u2019 because everyone is f**king pro-life, okay?\u201d she declared. \u201cWhat they come down to is they\u2019re anti-choice. They\u2019re taking away our choice.\u201d\nIn other words, abortion supporters\u2019 labels are accurate, while pro-lifers\u2019 are incorrect. But Milano\u2019s take is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the pro-life movement. Pro-lifers strive to protect and enable each person\u2019s choices. The difference is that they include the unborn in their definition of people.\nAccording to the actress, the abortion debate on the federal and state level was between \u201ctwo very separate belief systems\u201d: religion and science.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t separate the fact that they\u2019re trying to take away access to birth control and trying to take away access to safe abortions,\u201d she said of those who are religious, \u201cdoes that mean they want us to not have sex, are women not worthy of sexual pleasure? Like, what does that mean?\u201d\nMilano didn\u2019t seem aware of groups like Secular Pro-Life and Pro-Life Humanists that recognize abortion\u2019s violence even though they aren\u2019t religious. More generally, the pro-life movement sees science and religion as supporting one another, rather than as in conflict. The 2019 March for Life theme stressed science\u2019s role in combating abortion, from unveiling the unborn baby\u2019s unique DNA at fertilization to its heartbeat at six weeks.\nAnd, when it comes to birth control, pro-lifers aren\u2019t all in agreement. The recent debate by Christians has tried to distinguish between allowing others\u2019 contraceptive use and having to pay for others\u2019 contraceptive use. Christian-owned companies like Hobby Lobby made headlines in 2014 because they didn\u2019t want to provide employees with certain kinds because they saw them acting as abortifacients.\nRegardless, the point of the pro-life movement isn\u2019t to ban sex \u2013 something sacred \u2013 with a resounding \u201cno.\u201d It\u2019s to say \u201cyes\u201d to the inherent dignity and life of an unborn baby.\nSUPPORT LIFENEWS! To take o n the abortion industry, please help LifeNews.com with a donation!\nMilano overlooked that as she brought up what she called the \u201crace issue\u201d in abortion.\n\u201cRich, white people will always be able to afford and get safe abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the rights that they\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re trying to strip away from us are going to hurt the marginalized and the women that are most at risk, that have very low income, that are not going to be able to, you know, travel to a different state to get a state \u2013 safe abortion.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be hurt. They\u2019re going to try to get an abortion no matter how,\u201d she added. \u201cUnfortunately in this country, a lot of it stems back to racism.\u201d\nMilano failed to mention that the pro-life movement supports pregnancy centers that provide free resources, from housing to education, to help pregnant women in need. That includes Blacks or African-Americans, who accounted for 36 percent of abortions in 2015, according to the CDC\u2019s most recent abortion surveillance report.\nBut again, Milano\u2019s claim touches on another misunderstanding. Legislation restricting abortion isn\u2019t an evil plot to target low-income women who aren\u2019t white. It stems from acknowledging the intrinsic dignity and respect due to every human person, including minorities, from conception to natural death.\nMilano has a chance at comprehending the pro-life movement though \u2013 if she takes her own advice.\n\u201cOften we get so caught up in this sort of tribal mentality that we all have to believe the same thing and say the same thing and it\u2019s okay to be, to want the same thing, but to go about it in a different way,\u201d she told Skey about advancing different movements.\nAnd, she added of feminism, \u201cAs white women, if we\u2019re not fighting for every woman, we\u2019re not going to get this done. We\u2019re not going to achieve what we need to achieve.\u201d\nThe pro-life movement strives to support, protect, and empower women. But to accomplish that, it cherishes women at every stage in life, including in the womb.\nLifeNews Note: Katie Yoder writes for Town Hall, where this column originally appeared.",

It comes out in theaters nation-wide on March 29.\nAttendees described a packed theater Monday at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles where celebrities like singer Joy Villa, pro-life leaders including Lila Rose and Johnson herself, and conservative entrepreneur Mike Lindell had the opportunity to watch the film for the first time.\nSome said they were moved to tears by the film as it depicted Johnson\u2019s struggles through two abortions, her work at Planned Parenthood and her decision to leave and become pro-life.\nThe premier concluded with a standing ovation.\nJohnson, who spoke at the premier, tweeted a photo of her attending with her husband and oldest daughter:\nAt the red carpet premiere of @UnplannedMovie!!! I can\u2019t believe this is our life. It\u2019s all very surreal for this mama. pic.twitter.com/mG4n8emo0B\n\u2014 Abby Johnson (@AbbyJohnson) March 19, 2019\nMany in attendance were well-known pro-life leaders and conservative media personalities:\nStanding ovation for @UnplannedMovie.\nWell deserved! Congratulations to the cast and crew. Best movie released by @PureFlix. pic.twitter.com/Gr9A801lG0\n\u2014 Scooter Downey (@TrueLegendFilms) March 19, 2019\nJust watched Unplanned at its premiere. Highly recommend. I cried at least 4 times. It\u2019s a very moving story. Thank you @AbbyJohnson for sharing it with the world. I am proud to be pro-life.\n\u2014 Kassy Dillon (@KassyDillon) March 19, 2019\nWhat a night!\nHollywood rolled out the red carpet for the @UnplannedMovie!@AbbyJohnson, thank you for sharing your story with us.\nAnd @_AshleyBratcher, thank you for your powerful portrayal. pic.twitter.com/orrhUePt6W\n\u2014 Catherine Hadro (@CatSzeltner) March 19, 2019",

But, over the weekend, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O&rsquo;Rourke apologized for for writings he made as a teenager describing fantasies about running over children with a vehicle.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mortified to read it now, incredibly embarrassed, but I have to take ownership of my words,&rdquo; the Democratic presidential candidate said during a taping of the &ldquo;Political Party Live&rdquo; podcast in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. &ldquo;Whatever my intention was as a teenager doesn&rsquo;t matter, I have to look long and hard at my actions, at the language I have used, and I have to constantly try to do better.&rdquo;</p> <p>His comments come after a report Friday revealed O&rsquo;Rourke <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/03/15/beto-driving-over-kids/&source=gmail&ust=1552840586853000&usg=AFQjCNEWRUYekVzWXn8tkKRBvaoQAyQKKg\" href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/03/15/beto-driving-over-kids/\">wrote prose</a> when he was a teenager describing a scenario in which he would accelerate a car into a group of children while hearing them scream. The report also <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dailycaller.com/2019/03/15/beto-orourke-song-cow/&source=gmail&ust=1552840586853000&usg=AFQjCNFYkoy24UJnNegemT64Df73VwNuug\" href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/03/15/beto-orourke-song-cow/\">showed</a> he was a secret member of a hacking group called the &ldquo;Cult of the Dead Cow,&rdquo; which focused on showing people how to hack Microsoft computers.</p> <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not anything I&rsquo;m proud of today, and I mean, that&rsquo;s &mdash; that&rsquo;s the long and short of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All I can do is my best, which is what I&rsquo;m trying to do. I can&rsquo;t control anything I&rsquo;ve done in the past. I can only control what I do going forward and what I plan to do is give this my best.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;One day, as I was driving home from work, I noticed two children crossing the street. They were happy, happy to be free from their troubles&hellip;. This happiness was mine by right. I had earned it in my dreams,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Rourke wrote.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As I neared the young ones, I put all my weight on my right foot, keeping the accelerator pedal on the floor until I heard the crashing of the two children on the hood, and then the sharp cry of pain from one of the two. I was so fascinated for a moment, that when after I had stopped my vehicle, I just sat in a daze, sweet visions filling my head,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Rourke continued.</p>\n<p>The news is perhaps not surprising given that O&rsquo;Rourke supports abortions up to birth. That&rsquo;s a position he defended yesterday, as videoed during a campaign stop.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lifenews.com/2019/03/18/watch-beto-orourke-on-abortions-up-to-birth-that-should-be-a-decision-a-woman-makes-i-trust-her/\">O&rsquo;Rourke was captured on camera at a campaign event in Cleveland</a> responding to a question about third-trimester abortions and whether or not he supports abortions up to birth.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That should be a decision that the woman makes. I trust her,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Rourke says.</p>\n<p>Not only does O&rsquo;Rourke have a 100-percent pro-abortion voting record like the other Democrat presidential candidates, he also <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1322/cosponsors\">sponsored a radical pro-abortion bill</a> that would have legalized abortions for basically any reason up to birth.</p>\n<p>The so-called &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s Health Protection Act&rdquo; was introduced in Congress in 2017, with dozens of Democrat sponsors, including likely presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kristen Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lifenews.com/2018/01/23/what-if-pro-abortion-democrats-took-back-congress/\">Nicknamed the &ldquo;Abortion Without Limits Until Birth Act&rdquo;</a> by pro-life groups, the bill would have invalidated nearly all state and federal abortion regulations, including waiting periods, informed consent requirements, bans on late-term abortions and sex-selection abortions and more.</p>\n<p>The congressman has also failed to speak out against <a href=\"https://www.lifenews.com/2019/03/13/house-democrats-block-bill-to-stop-infanticide-for-17th-time-refuse-care-for-aborted-babies-born-alive/\">Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats blocking a request by Republicans to vote</a> on a similar bill to require medical care and treatment for babies who survive abortions.

The report also showed he was a secret member of a hacking group called the \u201cCult of the Dead Cow,\u201d which focused on showing people how to hack Microsoft computers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not anything I\u2019m proud of today, and I mean, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the long and short of it,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I can do is my best, which is what I\u2019m trying to do. I can\u2019t control anything I\u2019ve done in the past. I can only control what I do going forward and what I plan to do is give this my best.\u201d\n\u201cOne day, as I was driving home from work, I noticed two children crossing the street. They were happy, happy to be free from their troubles\u2026. This happiness was mine by right. I had earned it in my dreams,\u201d O\u2019Rourke wrote.\n\u201cAs I neared the young ones, I put all my weight on my right foot, keeping the accelerator pedal on the floor until I heard the crashing of the two children on the hood, and then the sharp cry of pain from one of the two. I was so fascinated for a moment, that when after I had stopped my vehicle, I just sat in a daze, sweet visions filling my head,\u201d O\u2019Rourke continued.\nThe news is perhaps not surprising given that O\u2019Rourke supports abortions up to birth. That\u2019s a position he defended yesterday, as videoed during a campaign stop.\nO\u2019Rourke was captured on camera at a campaign event in Cleveland responding to a question about third-trimester abortions and whether or not he supports abortions up to birth.\n\u201cThat should be a decision that the woman makes. I trust her,\u201d O\u2019Rourke says.\nNot only does O\u2019Rourke have a 100-percent pro-abortion voting record like the other Democrat presidential candidates, he also sponsored a radical pro-abortion bill that would have legalized abortions for basically any reason up to birth.\nThe so-called \u201cWomen\u2019s Health Protection Act\u201d was introduced in Congress in 2017, with dozens of Democrat sponsors, including likely presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kristen Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders.\nNicknamed the \u201cAbortion Without Limits Until Birth Act\u201d by pro-life groups, the bill would have invalidated nearly all state and federal abortion regulations, including waiting periods, informed consent requirements, bans on late-term abortions and sex-selection abortions and more.\nThe congressman has also failed to speak out against Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats blocking a request by Republicans to vote on a similar bill to require medical care and treatment for babies who survive abortions. That puts him on record supporting their decision to allow infanticide to continue unprosecuted.\nClick here to sign up for pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\nHere is his lengthy record supporting abortion, courtesy of Texas Right to Life.",

Moscatello has also written for <em>Glamour</em> and<em> GQ</em> magazines.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Films like <em>Unplanned </em>can radicalize people who are vulnerable to extremism and have the potential to become violent. It is films like <em>Unplanned</em> that could get more people killed,&rdquo; she claimed. Moscatello also tried to tie his murderer to pro-life groups and &ldquo;conservative media.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Moscatello also cast doubt on Johnson&rsquo;s first-hand knowledge of Planned Parenthood and suggested it could be designed to inspire such attacks. She wrote that the movie was promoted &ldquo;under the guise that this is a narrative based in fact rather than a dangerous call to action.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Her supposed evidence for such extreme claims was that the film has a &ldquo;familiar villain&rdquo; in Planned Parenthood, positive portrayal of &ldquo;Christian anti-abortion group&rdquo; Coalition for Life, and that it showed the actress playing Johnson telling other pro-lifers that many women will drive away from an abortion clinic if they see protesters praying outside.</p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://instagram.com/lifenewspics/\">Follow LifeNews.com on Instagram</a> for pro-life pictures and videos.</strong></em></p>\n<p>She denounced the film for inaccuracies, but even more for &ldquo;the true crux of the film &mdash; that abortion is unsafe.&rdquo; Well, it is always unsafe for the unborn and <a href=\"http://afterabortion.org/2012/abortion-risks-abortion-complications-abortion-dangers-abortion-side-effects/\">can also harm mothers</a> as well.</p>\n<p>For Moscatello and The Cut, it was ludicrous to portray Planned Parenthood as evil even though it&rsquo;s responsible for taking the life of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtgqxvaV-8U\">more than 300,000 unborn babies</a> each year, according to Live Action. She also grumbled about the movie showing &ldquo;Coalition for Life&rdquo; saying things like &ldquo;Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s sex-education program &lsquo;has a deadly influence on the youth of today.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Moscatello concluded with a creepy anecdote from when she watched <em>Unplanned </em>screening, recalling that a &ldquo;woman with white hair&rdquo; and a &ldquo;man in the third row&rdquo; were visibility nodding and gesticulating when the actress playing Abby Johnson called for more abortion clinic protests.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that I was witnessing something scary. Then the lights came on, and everyone looked perfectly nice,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>The only scary thing is how radically pro-abortion and pro-Planned Parenthood the liberal media are</p>\n<p><em>LifeNews Note: Gabriel Hays writes for <a href=\"https://newsbusters.org/\">Newsbusters</a>, where this <a href=\"https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/culture/gabriel-hays/2019/04/16/cut-unplanned-film-dangerous-could-radicalize-and-inspire\">originally appeared</a>.</em></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" src=\"https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/caitlinmoscatello.png\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/caitlinmoscatello.png 658w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/caitlinmoscatello-150x96.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/caitlinmoscatello-236x150.png 236w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/caitlinmoscatello-190x121.png 190w\"></img><figcaption>Share this story:</figcaption></figure>",

Moscatello has also written for Glamour and GQ magazines.\n\u201cFilms like Unplanned can radicalize people who are vulnerable to extremism and have the potential to become violent. It is films like Unplanned that could get more people killed,\u201d she claimed. Moscatello also tried to tie his murderer to pro-life groups and \u201cconservative media.\u201d\nMoscatello also cast doubt on Johnson\u2019s first-hand knowledge of Planned Parenthood and suggested it could be designed to inspire such attacks. She wrote that the movie was promoted \u201cunder the guise that this is a narrative based in fact rather than a dangerous call to action.\u201d\nHer supposed evidence for such extreme claims was that the film has a \u201cfamiliar villain\u201d in Planned Parenthood, positive portrayal of \u201cChristian anti-abortion group\u201d Coalition for Life, and that it showed the actress playing Johnson telling other pro-lifers that many women will drive away from an abortion clinic if they see protesters praying outside.\nFollow LifeNews.com on Instagram for pro-life pictures and videos.\nShe denounced the film for inaccuracies, but even more for \u201cthe true crux of the film \u2014 that abortion is unsafe.\u201d Well, it is always unsafe for the unborn and can also harm mothers as well.\nFor Moscatello and The Cut, it was ludicrous to portray Planned Parenthood as evil even though it\u2019s responsible for taking the life of more than 300,000 unborn babies each year, according to Live Action. She also grumbled about the movie showing \u201cCoalition for Life\u201d saying things like \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s sex-education program \u2018has a deadly influence on the youth of today.\u2019\u201d\nMoscatello concluded with a creepy anecdote from when she watched Unplanned screening, recalling that a \u201cwoman with white hair\u201d and a \u201cman in the third row\u201d were visibility nodding and gesticulating when the actress playing Abby Johnson called for more abortion clinic protests.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was witnessing something scary. Then the lights came on, and everyone looked perfectly nice,\u201d she said.\nThe only scary thing is how radically pro-abortion and pro-Planned Parenthood the liberal media are\nLifeNews Note: Gabriel Hays writes for Newsbusters, where this originally appeared.",

They should have been closed years ago,&rdquo; said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue. &ldquo;American Women&rsquo;s Services is the most dangerous and deceptive abortion chain that is still operating in this country. Every day they are open they are exploiting women and risking their lives by cutting corners and lying for the sake of profit without regard for their customer&rsquo;s lives and health.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>New Jersey law prohibits those who are not licensed from owning medical practices.</p>\n<p>The consent order gives Kaji sixty days to sell the abortion businesses to a &ldquo;licensed physician&rdquo; and submit copies of the sales contract and any management contracts to the Board for review.</p>\n<p>The abortion businesses originally were owned by disgraced abortionist Steven Chase Brigham, whose own medical license was <a href=\"http://abortiondocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Brigham-Nov-12-2014-Order-of-Revocation1.pdf\">revoked</a> in November 2014, transferred ownership of his New Jersey abortion clinics to Kaji, who served as his medical director, for no monetary exchange and <a href=\"https://www.operationrescue.org/archives/brighams-transfer-ownership-for-7-abortion-clinics-was-a-sham-says-new-jersey-attorney-generals-office/\">without Kaji being aware</a> that he was the new owner.</p>\n<p>Brigham continues to run the abortion businesses behind the scenes in an &ldquo;administrative&rdquo; capacity while using an aging and incompetent Kaji as his shill. Kaji suffered a stroke and impairment in his dominant right hand along with memory difficulties that made it impossible to properly conduct his duties as owner and medical director of seven busy abortion clinics.</p>\n<p>Operation Rescue <a href=\"http://www.operationrescue.org/archives/brigham-transfers-new-jersey-abortion-clinics-to-confirmed-sex-abuser/\">filed a formal complaint</a> with the New Jersey Attorney General&rsquo;s office detailing research that showed no record of the ownership &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; and evidence of Brigham&rsquo;s continued operation of the abortion chain.</p>\n<p>The New Jersey Attorney General&rsquo;s office <a href=\"https://www.operationrescue.org/archives/brighams-transfer-ownership-for-7-abortion-clinics-was-a-sham-says-new-jersey-attorney-generals-office/\">described the business transfer as a &ldquo;sham&rdquo;</a> and took steps to end Brigham&rsquo;s participation &ndash; steps that were put on hold for four years while Kaji&rsquo;s competence was under evaluation.</p>\n<p><em><strong>SUPPORT LIFENEWS! If you like this pro-life article, <a href=\"http://www.lifenews.com/donate/\">please help LifeNews.com with a donation</a>!</strong></em></p>\n<p>If Kaji can sell the second-rate abortion businesses &ndash; and that is a big &ldquo;if&rdquo; &ndash; it is hoped that Brigham will also be cut off from any further profit and control.</p>\n<p>It is possible that if Kaji cannot sell within 60 days, the state could order the abortion clinics to shut down. Those include American Women&rsquo;s Services clinics in the following New Jersey communities:</p>\n<ul> <li>Elizabeth</li> <li>Englewood</li> <li>Galloway</li> <li>Hamilton</li> <li>Phillipsburg,</li> <li>Voorhees</li> <li>Woodbridge</li> </ul>\n<p>The American Women&rsquo;s Services has been fraught with controversy and accusations of illegal activity over the years, which has resulted in the loss Brigham&rsquo;s medical license in six states.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Brigham was caught operating an <a href=\"http://www.operationrescue.org/archives/botched-abortion-nightmare-i-wish-i-never-heard-of-them/\">illegal bi-state late-term abortion scheme</a> similar to one that cost him his medical license <a href=\"http://abortiondocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/newyorkrevocation-brigham.pdf\">in New York</a> in 1994. He would begin abortions as late as 30 weeks or more at his unlicensed office in Voorhees, New Jersey, where he was legally permitted to conduct abortions up to 14 weeks.</p>\n<p>To avoid running afoul of New Jersey law, Brigham would induce the women into active labor then caravan them to a secret late-term abortion facility in Elkton, Maryland, where the abortions would be completed. Brigham, who was never licensed in Maryland, conducted abortions illegally in Elkton. He shielded his illicit activity by using the license of <a href=\"http://abortiondocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/MDBP-Interview-Shepard.pdf\">another elderly physician</a>, whose mental and physical abilities were also impaired, as a cover in a similar way that he used Kaji.</p>\n<p>However, that scheme fell apart after Brigham and his new trainee, Utah abortionist <a href=\"https://www.operationrescue.org/archives/troubled-abortionist-nicola-riley-admits-lying-to-gain-licensure-in-utah/\">Nicola Riley</a>, nearly killed an 18-year old woman during a seriously botched 22-week abortion. Complaints filed by the Union Hospital in Elkton and the Johns Hopkins surgeon who saved her life resulted in the legal (if not practical) end of Brigham&rsquo;s medical career.</p>\n<p>Kaji has had his own set of troubles in the past. He was <a href=\"http://operationrescue.org/brigham/Kaji,%20Vikram%20Hiralal%2093-49-03525%20OK.pdf\">convicted</a> by the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners in 1993 for having improper sexual contact with three patients. Kaji reportedly had sex with one young girl at his office during business hours and later plied her with drugs. He knew his victim was vulnerable to his advances because she had been a depressed victim of child sex abuse with a history of psychiatric hospitalization. Kaji was also accused of giving improper breast and rectal exams to two other women. The NJBME placed Kaji on a 1-year suspension and fined him $5,000 and ordered him to undergo psychological counseling.</p>\n<p>Brigham continues to operate abortion clinics in Florida, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Maryland, where a woman, <a href=\"https://www.operationrescue.org/archives/brigham-quietly-reopens-maryland-abortion-clinic-where-patient-died/\">Maria Santiago</a>, was killed during a botched abortion in 2013. These clinics are not expected to be impacted by any action in New Jersey.</p>\n<p>Pennsylvania permanently banned Brigham from practicing medicine or operating any medical facility in that state in 2010, but that didn&rsquo;t stop him from <a href=\"https://www.operationrescue.org/archives/pennsylvania-abortion-clinic-with-ties-to-brigham-ordered-to-close/\">surreptitiously opening an abortion business</a> in Philadelphia in 2012. Once his affiliation was found out and complaints were filed by pro-life groups, including Operation Rescue, it was forced to close in 2013.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Brigham has learned well how to evade the law from his decades of legal woes. It is likely that he may try to transfer ownership of the clinics to someone close to him that will allow him to continue exploiting women for financial gain with his sloppy and dangerous practices. Hopefully, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office has had enough dealings with him that they will see through any attempts to pull off another sham transfer deal,&rdquo; said Newman. &ldquo;Closing Brigham and Kaji&rsquo;s American Women&rsquo;s Services in New Jersey will be one of the best things the state has ever done to protect women.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px\" src=\"https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vikramkaji2.png\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vikramkaji2.png 575w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vikramkaji2-150x98.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vikramkaji2-229x150.png 229w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vikramkaji2-190x124.png 190w\"></img><figcaption>Share this story:</figcaption></figure>",

                "text": "Abortionist Vikram Kaji, 82, whose medical license was voluntarily surrendered earlier this year after he was found incompetent to practice medicine, entered into a consent agreement on April 10, 2019, with the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners that requires him to sell seven New Jersey abortion businesses that operate under the American Women\u2019s Services banner, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\u201cIt is our hope that no buyer will be found for these shoddy abortion shops, and that they will be forced to close. They should have been closed years ago,\u201d said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue. \u201cAmerican Women\u2019s Services is the most dangerous and deceptive abortion chain that is still operating in this country. Every day they are open they are exploiting women and risking their lives by cutting corners and lying for the sake of profit without regard for their customer\u2019s lives and health.\u201d\nNew Jersey law prohibits those who are not licensed from owning medical practices.\nThe consent order gives Kaji sixty days to sell the abortion businesses to a \u201clicensed physician\u201d and submit copies of the sales contract and any management contracts to the Board for review.\nThe abortion businesses originally were owned by disgraced abortionist Steven Chase Brigham, whose own medical license was revoked in November 2014, transferred ownership of his New Jersey abortion clinics to Kaji, who served as his medical director, for no monetary exchange and without Kaji being aware that he was the new owner.\nBrigham continues to run the abortion businesses behind the scenes in an \u201cadministrative\u201d capacity while using an aging and incompetent Kaji as his shill. Kaji suffered a stroke and impairment in his dominant right hand along with memory difficulties that made it impossible to properly conduct his duties as owner and medical director of seven busy abortion clinics.\nOperation Rescue filed a formal complaint with the New Jersey Attorney General\u2019s office detailing research that showed no record of the ownership \u201ctransfer\u201d and evidence of Brigham\u2019s continued operation of the abortion chain.\nThe New Jersey Attorney General\u2019s office described the business transfer as a \u201csham\u201d and took steps to end Brigham\u2019s participation \u2013 steps that were put on hold for four years while Kaji\u2019s competence was under evaluation.\nSUPPORT LIFENEWS! If you like this pro-life article, please help LifeNews.com with a donation!\nIf Kaji can sell the second-rate abortion businesses \u2013 and that is a big \u201cif\u201d \u2013 it is hoped that Brigham will also be cut off from any further profit and control.\nIt is possible that if Kaji cannot sell within 60 days, the state could order the abortion clinics to shut down. Those include American Women\u2019s Services clinics in the following New Jersey communities:\nElizabeth\nEnglewood\nGalloway\nHamilton\nPhillipsburg,\nVoorhees\nWoodbridge\nThe American Women\u2019s Services has been fraught with controversy and accusations of illegal activity over the years, which has resulted in the loss Brigham\u2019s medical license in six states.\nIn 2010, Brigham was caught operating an illegal bi-state late-term abortion scheme similar to one that cost him his medical license in New York in 1994. He would begin abortions as late as 30 weeks or more at his unlicensed office in Voorhees, New Jersey, where he was legally permitted to conduct abortions up to 14 weeks.\nTo avoid running afoul of New Jersey law, Brigham would induce the women into active labor then caravan them to a secret late-term abortion facility in Elkton, Maryland, where the abortions would be completed. Brigham, who was never licensed in Maryland, conducted abortions illegally in Elkton. He shielded his illicit activity by using the license of another elderly physician, whose mental and physical abilities were also impaired, as a cover in a similar way that he used Kaji.\nHowever, that scheme fell apart after Brigham and his new trainee, Utah abortionist Nicola Riley, nearly killed an 18-year old woman during a seriously botched 22-week abortion. Complaints filed by the Union Hospital in Elkton and the Johns Hopkins surgeon who saved her life resulted in the legal (if not practical) end of Brigham\u2019s medical career.\nKaji has had his own set of troubles in the past. He was convicted by the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners in 1993 for having improper sexual contact with three patients. Kaji reportedly had sex with one young girl at his office during business hours and later plied her with drugs. He knew his victim was vulnerable to his advances because she had been a depressed victim of child sex abuse with a history of psychiatric hospitalization. Kaji was also accused of giving improper breast and rectal exams to two other women. The NJBME placed Kaji on a 1-year suspension and fined him $5,000 and ordered him to undergo psychological counseling.\nBrigham continues to operate abortion clinics in Florida, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Maryland, where a woman, Maria Santiago, was killed during a botched abortion in 2013. These clinics are not expected to be impacted by any action in New Jersey.\nPennsylvania permanently banned Brigham from practicing medicine or operating any medical facility in that state in 2010, but that didn\u2019t stop him from surreptitiously opening an abortion business in Philadelphia in 2012. Once his affiliation was found out and complaints were filed by pro-life groups, including Operation Rescue, it was forced to close in 2013.\n\u201cBrigham has learned well how to evade the law from his decades of legal woes. It is likely that he may try to transfer ownership of the clinics to someone close to him that will allow him to continue exploiting women for financial gain with his sloppy and dangerous practices. Hopefully, the Attorney General\u2019s office has had enough dealings with him that they will see through any attempts to pull off another sham transfer deal,\u201d said Newman. \u201cClosing Brigham and Kaji\u2019s American Women\u2019s Services in New Jersey will be one of the best things the state has ever done to protect women.\u201d",

Terri Collins, R-Decatur, would make an abortion and attempted abortion a felony. Exceptions would be allowed if the mother&rsquo;s life is at risk. Mothers would not be punished for having an abortion under the legislation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.timesdaily.com/news/gop-lawmakers-abortion-ban-bill-worth-potential-fight/article_c6809e6f-5f55-5309-811c-1f1f4eeec923.html\">Collins told the Times Daily</a> that she expects a legal challenge, and hopes the U.S. Supreme Court will uphold protections for the unborn.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was about creating something that was meant to go all the way to the Supreme Court, and it also needed to have the most value when talking about a pro-life bill if you are going to try and pass it,&rdquo; Collins said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I believe the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision was based on a lack of information that the baby in a womb is a person,&rdquo; she added.</p>\n<p>A state House committee has a hearing on the bill scheduled for Wednesday, <a href=\"https://whnt.com/2019/04/16/bill-to-outlaw-most-abortions-in-alabama-to-get-hearing/\">the AP reports</a>. The state Senate Judiciary Committee also is expected to consider the companion bill (Senate Bill 211) sometime this week.</p>\n<p>If approved and enforced, the legislation could save thousands of unborn babies&rsquo; lives every year. The Alabama Department of Public Health reported 6,768 abortions in 2017.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Keep up with the latest pro-life news and information on Twitter. </strong></em><a data-show-count=\"false\" data-size=\"large\" href=\"https://twitter.com/LifeNewsHQ\">Follow @LifeNewsHQ</a></p>\n<p>However, the abortion industry is expected to sue to block the law in court.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They are trying to tee this up as an opportunity for the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade and its progeny. There are already cases in the pipeline that will get to the Supreme Court long before this does,&rdquo; said Randall Marshall, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama.</p>\n<p>He told the AP that the law would be struck down in court quickly if it passes. Marshall said it also could cost state taxpayers millions of dollars in legal fees and cited another case where Alabama taxpayers were forced to pay Planned Parenthood and the ACLU $1.7 million after a court struck down another pro-life state law.</p>\n<p>That is a concern for a number of pro-life leaders. Even some pro-life advocates express concerns about the strategy of such legislation, because when states lose these battles, taxpayers often are forced to pay pro-abortion groups&rsquo; legal fees.</p>\n<p>Abortion groups have succeeded in overturning similar laws in court. In 2012, <a href=\"https://www.lifenews.com/2012/05/01/oklahoma-court-personhood-amendment-unconstitutional/\">the Oklahoma Supreme Court struck down a personhood bill</a> as unconstitutional because it recognized unborn babies as human beings who deserve the right to life.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lifenews.com/2011/11/08/personhood-amendment-in-mississippi-likely-wont-ban-abortion/\">When considering a similar Missouri statute in 1989</a>, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist ruled that the statute was nothing more than a statement of position that had no bearing on banning abortions or even limiting them in any way.</p>\n<p>Missouri had approved a statute saying, &ldquo;the life of each human being begins at conception&rdquo; and &ldquo;unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being.&rdquo; The statute required that all Missouri state laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with rights equal to those enjoyed by other persons.</p>\n<p>There is more hope that the new conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court may consider an abortion ban, but it is difficult to say if it would for certain &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.lifenews.com/2019/02/07/supreme-court-stops-enforcement-of-pro-life-louisiana-law-after-roberts-joins-pro-abortion-minority/\">especially after Chief Justice John Roberts recently sided with the liberal justices on an abortion case</a>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/26weekunbornbaby2.jpg\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/26weekunbornbaby2.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/26weekunbornbaby2-150x102.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/26weekunbornbaby2-222x150.jpg 222w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/26weekunbornbaby2-190x129.jpg 190w\"></img><figcaption>Share this story:</figcaption></figure>",

                "text": "Alabama lawmakers are considering a bill this week that would ban all abortions in the state by making the killing of an unborn baby a felony.\nHearings on the legislation are slated in the state House and Senate this week, as lawmakers weigh the merits of the pro-life bill against a potentially expensive legal challenge that could put more money in the pockets of the abortion industry.\nState House Bill 314, sponsored by Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, would make an abortion and attempted abortion a felony. Exceptions would be allowed if the mother\u2019s life is at risk. Mothers would not be punished for having an abortion under the legislation.\nCollins told the Times Daily that she expects a legal challenge, and hopes the U.S. Supreme Court will uphold protections for the unborn.\n\u201cIt was about creating something that was meant to go all the way to the Supreme Court, and it also needed to have the most value when talking about a pro-life bill if you are going to try and pass it,\u201d Collins said.\n\u201cI believe the Roe v. Wade decision was based on a lack of information that the baby in a womb is a person,\u201d she added.\nA state House committee has a hearing on the bill scheduled for Wednesday, the AP reports. The state Senate Judiciary Committee also is expected to consider the companion bill (Senate Bill 211) sometime this week.\nIf approved and enforced, the legislation could save thousands of unborn babies\u2019 lives every year. The Alabama Department of Public Health reported 6,768 abortions in 2017.\nKeep up with the latest pro-life news and information on Twitter. Follow @LifeNewsHQ\nHowever, the abortion industry is expected to sue to block the law in court.\n\u201cThey are trying to tee this up as an opportunity for the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade and its progeny. There are already cases in the pipeline that will get to the Supreme Court long before this does,\u201d said Randall Marshall, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama.\nHe told the AP that the law would be struck down in court quickly if it passes. Marshall said it also could cost state taxpayers millions of dollars in legal fees and cited another case where Alabama taxpayers were forced to pay Planned Parenthood and the ACLU $1.7 million after a court struck down another pro-life state law.\nThat is a concern for a number of pro-life leaders. Even some pro-life advocates express concerns about the strategy of such legislation, because when states lose these battles, taxpayers often are forced to pay pro-abortion groups\u2019 legal fees.\nAbortion groups have succeeded in overturning similar laws in court. In 2012, the Oklahoma Supreme Court struck down a personhood bill as unconstitutional because it recognized unborn babies as human beings who deserve the right to life.\nWhen considering a similar Missouri statute in 1989, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist ruled that the statute was nothing more than a statement of position that had no bearing on banning abortions or even limiting them in any way.\nMissouri had approved a statute saying, \u201cthe life of each human being begins at conception\u201d and \u201cunborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being.\u201d The statute required that all Missouri state laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with rights equal to those enjoyed by other persons.\nThere is more hope that the new conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court may consider an abortion ban, but it is difficult to say if it would for certain \u2013 especially after Chief Justice John Roberts recently sided with the liberal justices on an abortion case.",

They are identical in text but differ slightly in their titles. The first, (HB 3320) is &ldquo;An Act removing obstacles and expanding access to women&rsquo;s reproductive health.&rdquo; The second, (SB 1209) is &ldquo;An Act to remove obstacles and expand abortion access.&rdquo; Combined they share the same acronym &mdash; ROE.</p>\n<p>The supporters of these bills argue the proposed changes to Massachusetts law are simply intended to protect a woman&rsquo;s right to an abortion in the event the United States Supreme Court overturns the 1973 decision in the case of Roe vs. Wade. However, in reality these bills would create a significant expansion of current Massachusetts state law. More specifically, ROE would:</p>\n<p>1. Allow abortions during the nine months of pregnancy for virtually any reason.</p>\n<p>2. Eliminate any requirements that abortions be performed in a hospital.</p>\n<p>3. Eliminate the requirement that provides medical care to a child who survives an abortion attempt.</p>\n<p>4. Eliminate the requirement that a minor under the age of 18 have the consent of a parent, guardian, or the courts.</p>\n<p>5. Provide state funding for women who cannot afford the procedure.</p>\n<p>In order to understand the serious moral questions raised concerning the protection of human life, the specific wording of the bills must be examined closely. For example, that examination is particularly significant while considering the language that would allow for an abortion in the third trimester of a pregnancy. The two bills state in part:</p>\n<p><em><strong>HELP LIFENEWS SAVE BABIES FROM ABORTION! <a href=\"http://www.lifenews.com/donate/\">Please help LifeNews.com with a donation</a>!</strong></em></p>\n<p>A physician, acting within their lawful scope of practice, may perform an abortion when, according to the physician&rsquo;s best medical judgment based on the facts of the patient&rsquo;s case, the patient is beyond 24 weeks from the commencement of pregnancy and the abortion is necessary to protect the patient&rsquo;s life or physical or mental health, or in cases of lethal fetal anomalies, or where the fetus is incompatible with sustained life outside the uterus. Medical judgement may be exercised in the light of all factors &mdash; physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the person&rsquo;s age &mdash; relevant to the well-being of the patient.</p>\n<p>In just these two sentences, the bills would make extreme changes to Massachusetts law. In addition to aborting infants with fetal anomalies or where the fetus is incompatible with sustained life outside of the uterus, it allows physicians to perform abortions up until birth for a myriad of undefined reasons (i.e.: physical, emotional, psychological, familial, age) to protect a woman&rsquo;s life, physical health or mental health. The result would become abortion on demand for the full term of pregnancy.</p>\n<p>The Catholic Church has always upheld the dignity of human life and spoken out against abortion at all stages of pregnancy. As bishops we are encouraged by the most recent statistics which clearly indicate that the rate of abortions in both this state and across the country has significantly decreased over the past 40 years. In fact, the rates today are 50% lower than the rates in 1980. However, at a time when the overall number of abortions have decreased, society cannot now accept such an egregious attack on human life as these bills would provide.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we, the Roman Catholic Bishops of the four dioceses of Massachusetts, call on our elected officials to carefully consider the consequences that these bills would bring to the lives of infants, parents, families and the citizens of the commonwealth. We urge all people of good will, regardless of what faith they practice, to vigorously oppose these extreme measures.</p>\n<p><em>LifeNews Note: His Eminence Sean P.

                "text": "The Massachusetts State Legislature will consider passing into law two deeply troubling bills this legislative session. They are identical in text but differ slightly in their titles. The first, (HB 3320) is \u201cAn Act removing obstacles and expanding access to women\u2019s reproductive health.\u201d The second, (SB 1209) is \u201cAn Act to remove obstacles and expand abortion access.\u201d Combined they share the same acronym \u2014 ROE.\nThe supporters of these bills argue the proposed changes to Massachusetts law are simply intended to protect a woman\u2019s right to an abortion in the event the United States Supreme Court overturns the 1973 decision in the case of Roe vs. Wade. However, in reality these bills would create a significant expansion of current Massachusetts state law. More specifically, ROE would:\n1. Allow abortions during the nine months of pregnancy for virtually any reason.\n2. Eliminate any requirements that abortions be performed in a hospital.\n3. Eliminate the requirement that provides medical care to a child who survives an abortion attempt.\n4. Eliminate the requirement that a minor under the age of 18 have the consent of a parent, guardian, or the courts.\n5. Provide state funding for women who cannot afford the procedure.\nIn order to understand the serious moral questions raised concerning the protection of human life, the specific wording of the bills must be examined closely. For example, that examination is particularly significant while considering the language that would allow for an abortion in the third trimester of a pregnancy. The two bills state in part:\nHELP LIFENEWS SAVE BABIES FROM ABORTION! Please help LifeNews.com with a donation!\nA physician, acting within their lawful scope of practice, may perform an abortion when, according to the physician\u2019s best medical judgment based on the facts of the patient\u2019s case, the patient is beyond 24 weeks from the commencement of pregnancy and the abortion is necessary to protect the patient\u2019s life or physical or mental health, or in cases of lethal fetal anomalies, or where the fetus is incompatible with sustained life outside the uterus. Medical judgement may be exercised in the light of all factors \u2014 physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the person\u2019s age \u2014 relevant to the well-being of the patient.\nIn just these two sentences, the bills would make extreme changes to Massachusetts law. In addition to aborting infants with fetal anomalies or where the fetus is incompatible with sustained life outside of the uterus, it allows physicians to perform abortions up until birth for a myriad of undefined reasons (i.e.: physical, emotional, psychological, familial, age) to protect a woman\u2019s life, physical health or mental health. The result would become abortion on demand for the full term of pregnancy.\nThe Catholic Church has always upheld the dignity of human life and spoken out against abortion at all stages of pregnancy. As bishops we are encouraged by the most recent statistics which clearly indicate that the rate of abortions in both this state and across the country has significantly decreased over the past 40 years. In fact, the rates today are 50% lower than the rates in 1980. However, at a time when the overall number of abortions have decreased, society cannot now accept such an egregious attack on human life as these bills would provide.\nTherefore, we, the Roman Catholic Bishops of the four dioceses of Massachusetts, call on our elected officials to carefully consider the consequences that these bills would bring to the lives of infants, parents, families and the citizens of the commonwealth. We urge all people of good will, regardless of what faith they practice, to vigorously oppose these extreme measures.\nLifeNews Note: His Eminence Sean P.

BlackRock BLK, +2.06% and Progressive PGR, +0.07% led the sector after each company reported solid quarterly results.\nQualcomm QCOM, -0.33% powered technology sector stocks higher, gaining 23.2% in its best day in 20 years, on news the chipmaker and Apple AAPL, +0.00% had settled their bitter legal dispute centered on some of the technology that enables iPhones to connect to the internet. The deal requires Apple to pay Qualcomm an undisclosed amount. It also includes a six-year licensing agreement that likely involves recurring payments to the mobile chip maker.\nCompanies that posted encouraging results helped put traders in a buying mood Tuesday.\nThe S&P 500 SPX, +0.33% rose 0.1% to 2,907.06. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.30% gained 0.3% to 26,452.66. The Nasdaq composite COMP, +0.67% added 0.3% to 8,000.23. The index had not closed above 8,000 points since October.\nBut analysts expect first-quarter results for S&P 500 companies overall to be the weakest in nearly three years.\n\u201cThe markets are prepared for this year-over-year decline that everyone is expecting in earnings,\u201d said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. \u201cUnless we have some significant misses, we should be doing OK.\u201d\nThe yield on the 10 year Treasury note rose to 2.59% from 2.55% late Monday. The 10 year Treasury yield has been climbing since late last month, when it fell to 2.37% amid a crescendo of worries that global economic growth was slowing.\nBenchmark U.S. crude oil US:CLK9 rose gained 28 cents to $64.33 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gained 1% to settle at $64.05 per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude UK:LCOM9 , the international standard, added 8 cents to $71.80 per barrel. It picked up 0.8% to close at $71.72 per barrel in London.\nMore from MarketWatch",

British parliamentarians voted last week against leaving the EU without a deal in place on Mah 29.</p>\n<p>Ministers expect the Prime Minister to ask for the planned Brexit date to be moved out to June 30, with an option of requesting a longer delay left on the table. If a long extension is agreed, the U.K. would have to take part in the European elections in May and continue its role in EU decision making.</p>\n<p>Michel Barnier, the EU&rsquo;s chief Brexit negotiator, raised concerns on Tuesday about the delay.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;An extension will be something that extends uncertainty and that uncertainty has a cost. We can&rsquo;t do it without having a good reason for it,&rdquo; Barnier said after a meeting of ministers in Brussels. &ldquo;EU leaders will need a concrete plan in order to be able to make an informed decision.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Barnier said any request from the Prime Minister for a longer extension would need to be based on &ldquo;a new political process&rdquo; in the U.K., the Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56d43374-4a61-11e9-bbc9-6917dce3dc62?emailId=5c91bd29621bab0004537a40&segmentId=22011ee7-896a-8c4c-22a0-7603348b7f22\">reported</a>. That could be interpreted as a reference to a general election, a second referendum or a new cross-party initiative.</p>\n<p>The Prime Minister canvassed opinion from cabinet on a Brexit delay on Tuesday evening, once again exposing the stark divisions within her senior leadership team. Eight Eurosceptic ministers argued that any extension should last no longer than June 30, according the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc6e4afe-4a46-11e9-bbc9-6917dce3dc62?emailId=5c91bd29621bab0004537a40&segmentId=22011ee7-896a-8c4c-22a0-7603348b7f22\">Financial Times</a>, adding that Britain should be prepared to leave the EU without a deal at this point.</p>\n<p>May sought to schedule a third vote on her revised Brexit deal this week, after it was rejected for a second time by 149 votes. However, Commons Speaker John Bercow scuppered those plans on Monday by announcing that she would not be able to hold a vote again <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/brexit-brief-commons-speaker-drops-hand-grenade-on-mays-third-brexit-vote-2019-03-19\">without making substantial changes to her preferred agreement</a>.</p>",

                "text": "U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will ask Brussels to delay Britain\u2019s scheduled exit from the European Union, despite senior EU officials casting doubts over whether an extension to the timetable can be agreed.\nMay will travel to the Belgian capital on Thursday with little to offer the other 27 EU countries, which must unanimously agree to postpone the U.K.\u2019s exit from the bloc. British parliamentarians voted last week against leaving the EU without a deal in place on Mah 29.\nMinisters expect the Prime Minister to ask for the planned Brexit date to be moved out to June 30, with an option of requesting a longer delay left on the table. If a long extension is agreed, the U.K. would have to take part in the European elections in May and continue its role in EU decision making.\nMichel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, raised concerns on Tuesday about the delay.\n\u201cAn extension will be something that extends uncertainty and that uncertainty has a cost. We can\u2019t do it without having a good reason for it,\u201d Barnier said after a meeting of ministers in Brussels. \u201cEU leaders will need a concrete plan in order to be able to make an informed decision.\u201d\nBarnier said any request from the Prime Minister for a longer extension would need to be based on \u201ca new political process\u201d in the U.K., the Financial Times reported. That could be interpreted as a reference to a general election, a second referendum or a new cross-party initiative.\nThe Prime Minister canvassed opinion from cabinet on a Brexit delay on Tuesday evening, once again exposing the stark divisions within her senior leadership team. Eight Eurosceptic ministers argued that any extension should last no longer than June 30, according the Financial Times, adding that Britain should be prepared to leave the EU without a deal at this point.\nMay sought to schedule a third vote on her revised Brexit deal this week, after it was rejected for a second time by 149 votes. However, Commons Speaker John Bercow scuppered those plans on Monday by announcing that she would not be able to hold a vote again without making substantial changes to her preferred agreement.",

Katie Porter is shown speaking in October.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A tense exchange at a Capitol Hill hearing on credit reporting was generating buzz on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>California Democratic Rep. Katie Porter kicked off the back-and-forth with the CEO of Equifax Inc., which is still engaged in legal battles tied to its <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-year-after-equifax-cybersecurity-is-still-seeking-its-holy-grail-2018-09-07\">2017 data breach</a> that affected about 148 million customers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My question for you is whether you would be willing to share today your social security, your birthdate and your address at this public hearing,&rdquo; the freshman lawmaker said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I would be a bit uncomfortable doing that, congresswoman. If you would so oblige me, I&rsquo;d prefer not to,&rdquo; said Equifax <a data-fancyid=\"XNYSStockEFX\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/efx?mod=MW_story_quote\">EFX, +0.05%</a> CEO Mark Begor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sensitive information that I like to protect, and I think consumers should protect theirs.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Porter, who is on leave from her job as a law professor at the University of California Irvine, then asked him what he&rsquo;s worried about.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be concerned about identity theft. I&rsquo;m actually a victim of identity theft. It happened three times in the last 10 years to me&rdquo; Begor said.</p>\n<p>Porter pounced: &ldquo;If you agree that exposing this kind of information &mdash; information like that that you have in your credit reports &mdash; creates harm, therefore you&rsquo;re unwilling to share it, why are your lawyers arguing in federal court that there was no injury and no harm created by your data breach?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Begor responded that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;hard for me to comment on what our lawyers are doing,&rdquo; but the congresswoman told him: &ldquo;You do employ those lawyers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The hearing was aimed at &ldquo;repairing the nation&rsquo;s broken credit reporting system and holding the major consumer credit bureaus accountable,&rdquo; said California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, who chairs the committee, in <a href=\"https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402368\">her prepared remarks</a>. She promised a fresh legislative push to reform the sector.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We need to ask whether the system is so beyond repair that we need to completely rebuild the entire consumer credit reporting sector to truly put consumers first,&rdquo; Waters said.</p>\n<p>Equifax&rsquo;s stock rose 0.5% on Tuesday, while TransUnion fell 1.3%, Experian&rsquo;s U.S.-listed shares shed 1%, and the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.1%.</p>\n<p><strong>More from MarketWatch</strong> </p>",

Katie Porter kicked off the back-and-forth with the CEO of Equifax Inc., which is still engaged in legal battles tied to its 2017 data breach that affected about 148 million customers.\n\u201cMy question for you is whether you would be willing to share today your social security, your birthdate and your address at this public hearing,\u201d the freshman lawmaker said.\n\u201cI would be a bit uncomfortable doing that, congresswoman. If you would so oblige me, I\u2019d prefer not to,\u201d said Equifax EFX, +0.05% CEO Mark Begor. \u201cIt\u2019s sensitive information that I like to protect, and I think consumers should protect theirs.\u201d\nPorter, who is on leave from her job as a law professor at the University of California Irvine, then asked him what he\u2019s worried about.\n\u201cI\u2019d be concerned about identity theft. I\u2019m actually a victim of identity theft. It happened three times in the last 10 years to me\u201d Begor said.\nPorter pounced: \u201cIf you agree that exposing this kind of information \u2014 information like that that you have in your credit reports \u2014 creates harm, therefore you\u2019re unwilling to share it, why are your lawyers arguing in federal court that there was no injury and no harm created by your data breach?\u201d\nBegor responded that it\u2019s \u201chard for me to comment on what our lawyers are doing,\u201d but the congresswoman told him: \u201cYou do employ those lawyers.\u201d\nThe hearing was aimed at \u201crepairing the nation\u2019s broken credit reporting system and holding the major consumer credit bureaus accountable,\u201d said California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, who chairs the committee, in her prepared remarks. She promised a fresh legislative push to reform the sector.\n\u201cWe need to ask whether the system is so beyond repair that we need to completely rebuild the entire consumer credit reporting sector to truly put consumers first,\u201d Waters said.\nEquifax\u2019s stock rose 0.5% on Tuesday, while TransUnion fell 1.3%, Experian\u2019s U.S.-listed shares shed 1%, and the S&P 500 dipped 0.1%.\nMore from MarketWatch",

Vice President Mike Pence used a lunch with Republican senators at the Capitol to try keeping them aboard, citing a dangerous crisis at the border, but there were no signs he&rsquo;d succeeded.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I personally couldn&rsquo;t handicap the outcome at this point,&rdquo; said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who&rsquo;s planning a vote within the next three weeks. He even said Republicans remained uncertain about the legality of Trump&rsquo;s move, telling reporters, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the process of weighing that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Senate passage would force Trump&rsquo;s first veto, which Congress would surely lack the votes to override. But the showdown was forcing Republicans to cast uncomfortable votes pitting their support for a president wildly popular with GOP voters against fears that his expansive use of emergency powers would invite future Democratic presidents to do likewise for their own pet policies.</p>\n<p>Underscoring their desire to avoid a tally suggesting that Trump&rsquo;s hold on lawmakers was weakening, House Republican leaders worked to keep the number of GOP supporters well below 53. That&rsquo;s how many would be needed to reach a two-thirds majority of 288 votes, assuming all Democrats vote &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; the margin required for a veto override.</p>\n<p>Thirteen House Republicans joined all voting Democrats Tuesday to support the Democratic resolution. They included moderates from competitive districts like Fred Upton of Michigan and libertarian-leaning conservatives like Thomas Massie from Kentucky.</p>\n<p>The White House wrote to lawmakers formally threatening to veto the legislation. The letter said blocking the emergency declaration would &ldquo;undermine the administration&rsquo;s ability to respond effectively to the ongoing crisis at the Southern Border.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Republicans said Democrats were driven by politics and a desire to oppose Trump at every turn, and said Trump had clear authority to declare an emergency to protect the country. They also defended the president&rsquo;s claims of a security crisis along the boundary with Mexico, which he has said is ravaged by drug smugglers, human traffickers and immigrants trying to sneak into the U.S. illegally.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are at war on the Southern border with the drug cartels,&rdquo; said Rep. Pete Olson, R-Texas.</p>\n<p>Trump has asserted that barriers would stop drugs from Mexico from entering the U.S. In fact, government figures show that 90 percent of drugs intercepted from Mexico are caught at ports of entry, not remote areas where barriers would be constructed.</p>\n<p>Democrats said Republicans repeatedly accused former President Barack Obama of flouting the Constitution, which gives Congress control over spending, but are ignoring Trump&rsquo;s effort to do the same.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Is your oath of office to Donald Trump, or is your oath of office to the Constitution?&rdquo; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., asked Republicans.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s push for the wall reflected a continuation of the anti-immigrant views that helped fuel his election, some Democrats said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Since when do we call human beings in need a national emergency?&rdquo; said Mexican-born Rep. Jesus &ldquo;Chuy&rdquo; Garcia, D-Ill. &ldquo;Is he running out of insults for people like me?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Democrats also said the crisis is a fiction manufactured by Trump to dance around Congress&rsquo; vote this month to provide less than $1.4 billion for barrier construction. That was well below the $5.7 billion Trump demanded as he futilely forced a record-setting 35-day federal shutdown.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The president does not get to override Congress in a raucous temper tantrum over his inability to broker a deal&rdquo; with lawmakers for more money, said Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, sponsor of the one-sentence measure blocking the declaration, called Trump&rsquo;s move &ldquo;constitutional vandalism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump used a 1976 law to declare a national emergency and ordered the shift of $3.6 billion from military construction projects to wall building. Citing other powers, he intends to shift another $3.1 billion from Defense Department anti-drug efforts and a fund that collects seized assets.</p>\n<p>The money would be used to build steel barriers up to 30 feet tall and other barriers and for &ldquo;law enforcement efforts,&rdquo; said a White House statement.</p>\n<p>In the Senate, three Republicans have said they will back Democrats&rsquo; drive to block the emergency declaration: Maine&rsquo;s Susan Collins, Alaska&rsquo;s Lisa Murkowski and North Carolina&rsquo;s Thom Tillis. One more GOP defection would provide enough votes to approve the Democratic measure, assuming all Democrats and their independent allies back it.</p>\n<p>Republicans said senators asked Pence numerous questions about which projects Trump would divert to pay for the wall, with Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., saying the discussion was &ldquo;hearty.&rdquo; Shelby, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, which controls spending, said his panel would quickly &ldquo;backfill&rdquo; money for military construction with other funds he did not identify.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That issue won&rsquo;t stay alive long,&rdquo; Shelby told reporters.</p>\n<p>Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the chief GOP vote counter, said there may be GOP attempts to amend the House measure, saying Republicans &ldquo;think they have amendments that would improve it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That suggests that McConnell may try finding a way to add language that could sink the Democratic resolution or, perhaps, make it more palatable for Republicans. The law requires the Senate to vote on a measure within 18 days of receiving it from the House.</p>\n<p>Though presidents have declared 58 emergencies under the law, this is the first aimed at acquiring money for an item Congress has explicitly refused to finance, according to Elizabeth Goitein, co-director for national security at New York University Law School&rsquo;s Brennan Center for Justice. This is also the first time Congress has cast votes on whether to annul an emergency declaration, she said.</p>\n<p>Even with Democrats&rsquo; effort near-certain to ultimately fail, several lawsuits have been filed aimed at blocking the money, including by Democratic state attorneys general, progressive and environmental groups. Those suits at the very least are likely to delay access to those funds for months or years.</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats ignored a veto threat and rammed legislation through the House Tuesday that would stymie President Donald Trump\u2019s bid for billions of extra dollars for his border wall, escalating a clash over whether he was abusing his powers to advance his paramount campaign pledge.\nThe House\u2019s 245-182 vote to block Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration throws the political hot potato to the Republican-run Senate, where there were already enough GOP defections to edge it to the cusp of passage. Vice President Mike Pence used a lunch with Republican senators at the Capitol to try keeping them aboard, citing a dangerous crisis at the border, but there were no signs he\u2019d succeeded.\n\u201cI personally couldn\u2019t handicap the outcome at this point,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who\u2019s planning a vote within the next three weeks. He even said Republicans remained uncertain about the legality of Trump\u2019s move, telling reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of weighing that.\u201d\nSenate passage would force Trump\u2019s first veto, which Congress would surely lack the votes to override. But the showdown was forcing Republicans to cast uncomfortable votes pitting their support for a president wildly popular with GOP voters against fears that his expansive use of emergency powers would invite future Democratic presidents to do likewise for their own pet policies.\nUnderscoring their desire to avoid a tally suggesting that Trump\u2019s hold on lawmakers was weakening, House Republican leaders worked to keep the number of GOP supporters well below 53. That\u2019s how many would be needed to reach a two-thirds majority of 288 votes, assuming all Democrats vote \u201cyes,\u201d the margin required for a veto override.\nThirteen House Republicans joined all voting Democrats Tuesday to support the Democratic resolution. They included moderates from competitive districts like Fred Upton of Michigan and libertarian-leaning conservatives like Thomas Massie from Kentucky.\nThe White House wrote to lawmakers formally threatening to veto the legislation. The letter said blocking the emergency declaration would \u201cundermine the administration\u2019s ability to respond effectively to the ongoing crisis at the Southern Border.\u201d\nRepublicans said Democrats were driven by politics and a desire to oppose Trump at every turn, and said Trump had clear authority to declare an emergency to protect the country. They also defended the president\u2019s claims of a security crisis along the boundary with Mexico, which he has said is ravaged by drug smugglers, human traffickers and immigrants trying to sneak into the U.S. illegally.\n\u201cWe are at war on the Southern border with the drug cartels,\u201d said Rep. Pete Olson, R-Texas.\nTrump has asserted that barriers would stop drugs from Mexico from entering the U.S. In fact, government figures show that 90 percent of drugs intercepted from Mexico are caught at ports of entry, not remote areas where barriers would be constructed.\nDemocrats said Republicans repeatedly accused former President Barack Obama of flouting the Constitution, which gives Congress control over spending, but are ignoring Trump\u2019s effort to do the same.\n\u201cIs your oath of office to Donald Trump, or is your oath of office to the Constitution?\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., asked Republicans.\nTrump\u2019s push for the wall reflected a continuation of the anti-immigrant views that helped fuel his election, some Democrats said.\n\u201cSince when do we call human beings in need a national emergency?\u201d said Mexican-born Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, D-Ill. \u201cIs he running out of insults for people like me?\u201d\nDemocrats also said the crisis is a fiction manufactured by Trump to dance around Congress\u2019 vote this month to provide less than $1.4 billion for barrier construction. That was well below the $5.7 billion Trump demanded as he futilely forced a record-setting 35-day federal shutdown.\n\u201cThe president does not get to override Congress in a raucous temper tantrum over his inability to broker a deal\u201d with lawmakers for more money, said Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, sponsor of the one-sentence measure blocking the declaration, called Trump\u2019s move \u201cconstitutional vandalism.\u201d\nTrump used a 1976 law to declare a national emergency and ordered the shift of $3.6 billion from military construction projects to wall building. Citing other powers, he intends to shift another $3.1 billion from Defense Department anti-drug efforts and a fund that collects seized assets.\nThe money would be used to build steel barriers up to 30 feet tall and other barriers and for \u201claw enforcement efforts,\u201d said a White House statement.\nIn the Senate, three Republicans have said they will back Democrats\u2019 drive to block the emergency declaration: Maine\u2019s Susan Collins, Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski and North Carolina\u2019s Thom Tillis. One more GOP defection would provide enough votes to approve the Democratic measure, assuming all Democrats and their independent allies back it.\nRepublicans said senators asked Pence numerous questions about which projects Trump would divert to pay for the wall, with Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., saying the discussion was \u201chearty.\u201d Shelby, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, which controls spending, said his panel would quickly \u201cbackfill\u201d money for military construction with other funds he did not identify.\n\u201cThat issue won\u2019t stay alive long,\u201d Shelby told reporters.\nSen. John Thune of South Dakota, the chief GOP vote counter, said there may be GOP attempts to amend the House measure, saying Republicans \u201cthink they have amendments that would improve it.\u201d\nThat suggests that McConnell may try finding a way to add language that could sink the Democratic resolution or, perhaps, make it more palatable for Republicans. The law requires the Senate to vote on a measure within 18 days of receiving it from the House.\nThough presidents have declared 58 emergencies under the law, this is the first aimed at acquiring money for an item Congress has explicitly refused to finance, according to Elizabeth Goitein, co-director for national security at New York University Law School\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. This is also the first time Congress has cast votes on whether to annul an emergency declaration, she said.\nEven with Democrats\u2019 effort near-certain to ultimately fail, several lawsuits have been filed aimed at blocking the money, including by Democratic state attorneys general, progressive and environmental groups. Those suits at the very least are likely to delay access to those funds for months or years.",

The streaming-entertainment company reported earnings of $344 million, or 76 cents a share, up from 64 cents a share a year ago. Revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, up from $3.7 billion in the same period last year.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To start off the year with over nine-and-a-half-million acquisitions, It&rsquo;s a phenomenal start,&rdquo; Chief Executive Reed Hastings said in a video earnings interview released Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>The company&rsquo;s forecast for the second quarter was lighter than expected, though, both in profit and new subscribers. Netflix projected second-quarter earnings of 55 cents a share, which would be down from 85 cents a share a year ago and well lower than analysts&rsquo; estimates of 99 cents a share. Netflix shares initially sank more than 5%, but settled at a loss of 0.8% by the end of the extended session.</p>\n<p>Netflix Inc.</p>\n<p>Analysts on average expected Netflix to report first-quarter earnings of 58 cents a share on sales of $4.5 billion, according to FactSet. Analysts projected 8.06 million new paying subscribers, after Netflix said it expected to add 8.9 million paying subscribers. Investors focus much more on Netflix&rsquo;s subscriber count than its financial performance, because it is more predictive of where Netflix&rsquo;s finances are going, and is especially important amid new competition.</p>\n<p>Netflix&rsquo;s report arrives after two high-profile debuts of new rival streaming services from companies accomplished at attracting consumer eyeballs (and dollars): Apple Inc. <a data-fancyid=\"XNASStockAAPL\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl?mod=MW_story_quote\">AAPL, +0.00%</a> and Walt Disney Co. <a data-fancyid=\"XNYSStockDIS\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dis?mod=MW_story_quote\">DIS, +0.94%</a> . In its previous earnings report, <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-thinks-fortnite-is-a-bigger-competitor-than-hbo-2019-01-17\">Netflix altered its quarterly view of the competition</a> to note that it competes with much more than just other streaming services, though, and on Tuesday executives again insisted there is plenty of growth available to multiple streaming services as more consumers move away from traditional television services.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a ton of competition out there,&rdquo; Hastings said in the video interview. &ldquo;Disney and Apple add a little bit more, but frankly I doubt it will be material because again there&rsquo;s already so many competitors for entertainment time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Netflix also provided select viewership metrics on select content, as it began doing in the previous quarter. Netflix said that more than 52 million subscribers watched &ldquo;Triple Frontier,&rdquo; a big-budget action movie starring Ben Affleck, in its first four weeks of availability, and that the series &ldquo;Umbrella Academy&rdquo; was watched by 45 million member households in its first four weeks.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Over the next several months, we&rsquo;re going to be rolling out more specific granular reporting &mdash; first to our producers, and then to our members and of course to the press over time &mdash; and be more fully transparent about what people are watching on Netflix around the world,&rdquo; Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in Tuesday&rsquo;s video interview.</p>\n<p>Netflix expects 5 million new paying subscribers in the second quarter, while analysts were projecting 5.3 million on average, but Netflix executives said they &ldquo;expect another year of record annual paid net adds in 2019,&rdquo; which means topping 2018&rsquo;s total of 28.6 million new paying subscribers.</p>\n<p>The biggest deficit in Netflix&rsquo;s forecast was in U.S. subscribers &mdash; Netflix expects only 300,000 new paying subscribers in the U.S., while analysts were expecting more than double that total. Netflix is increasing prices in the U.S., and noted in its letter that price increases can lead to &ldquo;some modest short-term churn effect.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Some of the costs of running the business were shifted to later in the year as well, and there seems to be more potential concerns about costs for the rest of 2019.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Operating margin of 10.2% exceeded our beginning-of-quarter expectation as some spending was shifted from Q1 to later in the year,&rdquo; Netflix explained in the letter to investors, while maintaining a goal of a 13% operating margin for the full year.</p>\n<p>Netflix increased its estimate for how much money it will spend this year, saying that it now expects its free-cash flow deficit to be around $3.5 billion, as it continues to pay for new content. Executives cited &ldquo;higher cash taxes related to the change in our corporate structure and additional investments in real estate and other infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Netflix said it expects a higher effective tax rate this year, including a 48% rate in the second quarter, &ldquo;due to one-time discrete events.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Netflix shares closed 3% higher Tuesday, at $359.46. The stock has increased 16.8% in the past year, as the S&amp;P 500 index <a data-fancyid=\"SPUSIndexSPX\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote\">SPX, +0.33%</a> has gained 8.6%.</p>",

                "text": "Netflix Inc. attracted a record number of paying subscribers in the first quarter of 2019, a fact that would usually coincide with huge gains for its stock, but concerns about the rest of the year actually damaged shares Tuesday afternoon.\nNetflix NFLX, -0.74% on Tuesday reported first-quarter earnings, including the addition of 9.6 million new paying subscribers in the first three months of the year, a record for a single quarter. The streaming-entertainment company reported earnings of $344 million, or 76 cents a share, up from 64 cents a share a year ago. Revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, up from $3.7 billion in the same period last year.\n\u201cTo start off the year with over nine-and-a-half-million acquisitions, It\u2019s a phenomenal start,\u201d Chief Executive Reed Hastings said in a video earnings interview released Tuesday afternoon.\nThe company\u2019s forecast for the second quarter was lighter than expected, though, both in profit and new subscribers. Netflix projected second-quarter earnings of 55 cents a share, which would be down from 85 cents a share a year ago and well lower than analysts\u2019 estimates of 99 cents a share. Netflix shares initially sank more than 5%, but settled at a loss of 0.8% by the end of the extended session.\nNetflix Inc.\nAnalysts on average expected Netflix to report first-quarter earnings of 58 cents a share on sales of $4.5 billion, according to FactSet. Analysts projected 8.06 million new paying subscribers, after Netflix said it expected to add 8.9 million paying subscribers. Investors focus much more on Netflix\u2019s subscriber count than its financial performance, because it is more predictive of where Netflix\u2019s finances are going, and is especially important amid new competition.\nNetflix\u2019s report arrives after two high-profile debuts of new rival streaming services from companies accomplished at attracting consumer eyeballs (and dollars): Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.00% and Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.94% . In its previous earnings report, Netflix altered its quarterly view of the competition to note that it competes with much more than just other streaming services, though, and on Tuesday executives again insisted there is plenty of growth available to multiple streaming services as more consumers move away from traditional television services.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of competition out there,\u201d Hastings said in the video interview. \u201cDisney and Apple add a little bit more, but frankly I doubt it will be material because again there\u2019s already so many competitors for entertainment time.\u201d\nNetflix also provided select viewership metrics on select content, as it began doing in the previous quarter. Netflix said that more than 52 million subscribers watched \u201cTriple Frontier,\u201d a big-budget action movie starring Ben Affleck, in its first four weeks of availability, and that the series \u201cUmbrella Academy\u201d was watched by 45 million member households in its first four weeks.\n\u201cOver the next several months, we\u2019re going to be rolling out more specific granular reporting \u2014 first to our producers, and then to our members and of course to the press over time \u2014 and be more fully transparent about what people are watching on Netflix around the world,\u201d Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in Tuesday\u2019s video interview.\nNetflix expects 5 million new paying subscribers in the second quarter, while analysts were projecting 5.3 million on average, but Netflix executives said they \u201cexpect another year of record annual paid net adds in 2019,\u201d which means topping 2018\u2019s total of 28.6 million new paying subscribers.\nThe biggest deficit in Netflix\u2019s forecast was in U.S. subscribers \u2014 Netflix expects only 300,000 new paying subscribers in the U.S., while analysts were expecting more than double that total. Netflix is increasing prices in the U.S., and noted in its letter that price increases can lead to \u201csome modest short-term churn effect.\u201d\nSome of the costs of running the business were shifted to later in the year as well, and there seems to be more potential concerns about costs for the rest of 2019.\n\u201cOperating margin of 10.2% exceeded our beginning-of-quarter expectation as some spending was shifted from Q1 to later in the year,\u201d Netflix explained in the letter to investors, while maintaining a goal of a 13% operating margin for the full year.\nNetflix increased its estimate for how much money it will spend this year, saying that it now expects its free-cash flow deficit to be around $3.5 billion, as it continues to pay for new content. Executives cited \u201chigher cash taxes related to the change in our corporate structure and additional investments in real estate and other infrastructure.\u201d\nNetflix said it expects a higher effective tax rate this year, including a 48% rate in the second quarter, \u201cdue to one-time discrete events.\u201d\nNetflix shares closed 3% higher Tuesday, at $359.46. The stock has increased 16.8% in the past year, as the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.33% has gained 8.6%.",

Monetary impressionists may not be seeing the forest for the trees, to mix up the metaphor.</p>\n<p>The Fed began issuing its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for the next three years and longer run back in 2007, specifically with the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc_historical.htm\">October 30-31, 2007</a> Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting materials. Included in the SEP is the dot plot, which reflects each participant&rsquo;s view of the appropriate federal funds rate trajectory &ldquo;in the scenario that he or she sees as most likely,&rdquo; according to Powell. The scenarios outline participants&rsquo; outlooks for the U.S. unemployment rate, the pace of real GDP growth, and the inflation rate.</p>\n<p>Looking at Figure 2 in the FOMC&rsquo;s most recent SEP, from <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20181219.pdf\">Dec. 19, 2018</a>, we see the median forecast for the federal funds rate envisioned would rise to 2.90% this year and 3.10% in 2020. The precision of these (median) point estimates in the dot plot is at odds with repeated warnings by Fed officials that the outlook is highly uncertain and that incoming data will dictate the appropriate policy response. We take Powell&rsquo;s impressionist interpretation to mean that the Fed hasn&rsquo;t had a clear enough view of what lies ahead to put much faith in the latest dots. Indeed, he seems to be questioning the usefulness of the entire exercise, and may be signaling its demise. Consider the following:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Collateral confusion:</strong> This is not the first time that a Fed chair has provided Fed watchers with an art class on interpreting the Fed&rsquo;s dot-based pictures of monetary policy. In his speech, Powell reviewed two previous instances. In 2014, the dots caused &ldquo;collateral confusion,&rdquo; according to the then Fed Chair Janet Yellen, when the markets misread the Fed&rsquo;s intentions. She stated that what matters more than the dots is what is said in the FOMC Statement released after each meeting.</p>\n<p>Similarly, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke once said that the &ldquo;dots&rdquo; are merely inputs to the Fed&rsquo;s policy decision-making; they don&rsquo;t account for &ldquo;all the risks, the uncertainties, all the things that inform our collective judgement.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>2. Bullard&rsquo;s missing dot: </strong> Powell didn&rsquo;t specifically mention him, but St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, a current voter on the FOMC, has questioned the usefulness of the dots for some time. Since 2016, Bullard has opted out of providing longer-run projections, the only participant to do so. He explained why in a <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/files/pdfs/bullard/papers/regime-switching-forecasts-17june2016.pdf\">paper</a>, contending that switches among monetary policy &ldquo;regimes&rdquo;&mdash; and the possible future macroeconomic outcomes they may lead to &mdash; are not forecastable beyond 2.5 years</p>\n<p><strong>3. FOMC&rsquo;s flexible course: </strong> Perhaps Bullard led the FOMC participants in an impromptu discussion about the dots during the January 29-30 meeting? According to the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20190130.pdf\">Minutes</a>: &ldquo;A few participants expressed concerns that in the current environment of increased uncertainty, the policy rate projections prepared as part of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) do not accurately convey the Committee&rsquo;s policy outlook.&rdquo; It was the first time that the minutes suggested that this subject had been discussed in a FOMC meeting.</p>\n<p>These unnamed participants were concerned that &ldquo;the public had misinterpreted the median or central tendency of those projections as representing the consensus view of the Committee or as suggesting that policy was on a preset course.&rdquo; In other words: The public doesn&rsquo;t understand impressionistic art, so let&rsquo;s stop showing it to them.</p>\n<p><strong>4. A suggestion:</strong> We are not fans of the dot plot. We think that a data-dependent approach is the most sensible way to run monetary policy. Nevertheless, the SEP does provide some useful insights into the heads of the Fed heads.</p>\n<p>While the words of Fed officials along with the FOMC Statement and the Minutes help to paint the larger picture of monetary policy, it would also be helpful if the estimated probability of occurrence associated with each of the participants&rsquo; projections was indicated within the SEP.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Spot off: </strong> Barring an unexpected inflation surprise, we are fairly certain that the Fed will continue to be patient and not raise rates until at least the end of the year. One thing we are absolutely sure of: We won&rsquo;t be gazing at the Fed&rsquo;s upcoming release of the dot plot for the March 19-20 FOMC <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm\">meeting</a> for long. We&rsquo;ll take Powell&rsquo;s advice and view it with a cursory glance and from a few steps back.</p>\n<p>In any case, given that the dot plot hasn&rsquo;t been spot-on in a very long time, we won&rsquo;t be upset if the Fed deletes the dots in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Melissa Tagg is a senior economist at Yardeni Research, Inc.

                "text": "Don\u2019t look too closely at the Fed\u2019s \u201cdot plot\u201d or you might miss the larger monetary policy picture.\nThat was Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s admonition in a March 8 speech titled \u201cMonetary Policy: Normalization and the Road Ahead.\u201d To make his point, he showed two unusual images: an unrecognizable close-up of a bouquet of flowers from impressionist painter Georges Seurat\u2019s \u201cA Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\u201d and a highly recognizable image of the full painting. Monetary impressionists may not be seeing the forest for the trees, to mix up the metaphor.\nThe Fed began issuing its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for the next three years and longer run back in 2007, specifically with the October 30-31, 2007 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting materials. Included in the SEP is the dot plot, which reflects each participant\u2019s view of the appropriate federal funds rate trajectory \u201cin the scenario that he or she sees as most likely,\u201d according to Powell. The scenarios outline participants\u2019 outlooks for the U.S. unemployment rate, the pace of real GDP growth, and the inflation rate.\nLooking at Figure 2 in the FOMC\u2019s most recent SEP, from Dec. 19, 2018, we see the median forecast for the federal funds rate envisioned would rise to 2.90% this year and 3.10% in 2020. The precision of these (median) point estimates in the dot plot is at odds with repeated warnings by Fed officials that the outlook is highly uncertain and that incoming data will dictate the appropriate policy response. We take Powell\u2019s impressionist interpretation to mean that the Fed hasn\u2019t had a clear enough view of what lies ahead to put much faith in the latest dots. Indeed, he seems to be questioning the usefulness of the entire exercise, and may be signaling its demise. Consider the following:\n1. Collateral confusion: This is not the first time that a Fed chair has provided Fed watchers with an art class on interpreting the Fed\u2019s dot-based pictures of monetary policy. In his speech, Powell reviewed two previous instances. In 2014, the dots caused \u201ccollateral confusion,\u201d according to the then Fed Chair Janet Yellen, when the markets misread the Fed\u2019s intentions. She stated that what matters more than the dots is what is said in the FOMC Statement released after each meeting.\nSimilarly, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke once said that the \u201cdots\u201d are merely inputs to the Fed\u2019s policy decision-making; they don\u2019t account for \u201call the risks, the uncertainties, all the things that inform our collective judgement.\u201d\n2. Bullard\u2019s missing dot: Powell didn\u2019t specifically mention him, but St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, a current voter on the FOMC, has questioned the usefulness of the dots for some time. Since 2016, Bullard has opted out of providing longer-run projections, the only participant to do so. He explained why in a paper, contending that switches among monetary policy \u201cregimes\u201d\u2014 and the possible future macroeconomic outcomes they may lead to \u2014 are not forecastable beyond 2.5 years\n3. FOMC\u2019s flexible course: Perhaps Bullard led the FOMC participants in an impromptu discussion about the dots during the January 29-30 meeting? According to the Minutes: \u201cA few participants expressed concerns that in the current environment of increased uncertainty, the policy rate projections prepared as part of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) do not accurately convey the Committee\u2019s policy outlook.\u201d It was the first time that the minutes suggested that this subject had been discussed in a FOMC meeting.\nThese unnamed participants were concerned that \u201cthe public had misinterpreted the median or central tendency of those projections as representing the consensus view of the Committee or as suggesting that policy was on a preset course.\u201d In other words: The public doesn\u2019t understand impressionistic art, so let\u2019s stop showing it to them.\n4. A suggestion: We are not fans of the dot plot. We think that a data-dependent approach is the most sensible way to run monetary policy. Nevertheless, the SEP does provide some useful insights into the heads of the Fed heads.\nWhile the words of Fed officials along with the FOMC Statement and the Minutes help to paint the larger picture of monetary policy, it would also be helpful if the estimated probability of occurrence associated with each of the participants\u2019 projections was indicated within the SEP.\n5. Spot off: Barring an unexpected inflation surprise, we are fairly certain that the Fed will continue to be patient and not raise rates until at least the end of the year. One thing we are absolutely sure of: We won\u2019t be gazing at the Fed\u2019s upcoming release of the dot plot for the March 19-20 FOMC meeting for long. We\u2019ll take Powell\u2019s advice and view it with a cursory glance and from a few steps back.\nIn any case, given that the dot plot hasn\u2019t been spot-on in a very long time, we won\u2019t be upset if the Fed deletes the dots in the future.\nMelissa Tagg is a senior economist at Yardeni Research, Inc.

Qualcomm <a data-fancyid=\"XNASStockQCOM\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/qcom?mod=MW_story_quote\">QCOM, +2.23%</a> did add a slide to the news release that it sent reporters and analysts to indicate that it expects an additional $2 a share in profit. Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers estimated, based on that statement, that Qualcomm expects about $2.4 billion as product shipments begin to ramp.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-surges-as-apple-agrees-to-settlement-2019-04-16\">Qualcomm&rsquo;s shares soared more than 20% in regular trading</a> as the news filtered out. Apple <a data-fancyid=\"XNASStockAAPL\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl?mod=MW_story_quote\">AAPL, +0.82%</a> shares were pretty much flat on the news, since the company will be shelling out possibly several billion dollars in catch-up payments to Qualcomm, plus attorney&rsquo;s fees, for litigation that has now gone on a little more than two years.</p>\n<p>Qualcomm Inc.</p>\n<p>As part of their agreement, Apple will license future products from Qualcomm directly, instead of having its original equipment manufacturers license chips from the San Diego-based chip maker. Apple signed a six-year licensing agreement, with a two-year option to extend the deal.</p>\n<p>The big loser in the deal may be neither of the two companies involved. Shares of Intel Corp. <a data-fancyid=\"XNASStockINTC\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/intc?mod=MW_story_quote\">INTC, +2.87%</a>, Apple&rsquo;s current provider of communications chips for the iPhone, slipped in immediate after-hours trading on thoughts that Apple made the deal to avoid solely counting on Intel to make it to 5G. Qualcomm&rsquo;s first-generation 5G chip platform is expected to power the first 5G phones later this year, and its second-generation 5G chip will sample with customers next quarter and be in products in the first half of 2020.</p>\n<p>Pat Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, said Apple was &ldquo;motivated to negotiate,&rdquo; as it has fallen behind in adopting the next generation of mobile technology. &ldquo;They benefit from an accelerated 5G schedule, a lower-risk 5G schedule,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p><strong>More from Therese: <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/salesforcecom-buys-salesforceorg-and-thats-the-only-straightforward-part-2019-04-15\">Salesforce.com buys Salesforce.org, and that&rsquo;s the only straightforward part</a></strong></p>\n<p>Intel made it official later Tuesday afternoon, when it issued a statement that <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/intel-drops-out-of-5g-modem-business-after-apple-qualcomm-settlement-2019-04-16\">it was exiting the 5G modem business,</a> noting that Bob Swan, its new CEO, was reviewing its businesses and &ldquo;that it has become apparent that there is no clear path to profitability and positive returns.&rdquo; Intel said it is still excited about the opportunity for 5G and the &ldquo;cloudification&rdquo; of the network. Intel shares shot up more than 4% in after-hours trading following the announcement.</p>\n<p>Several analysts speculated on Twitter that Intel&rsquo;s plans to exit 5G modems may have propelled Apple&rsquo;s settlement with Qualcomm. Moorhead said it was a positive move for Intel, because it will let the company focus on other, more important, product areas.</p>\n<p>Apple was Intel&rsquo;s biggest customer for wireless communications chips, and Intel&rsquo;s delay in 5G had put additional pressure on Apple, which is already dealing with slower growth in its once-exploding iPhone business. Many of its rivals are launching 5G smartphones, which were all the talk of the latest Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but some of the recent unveilings lacked a date as to when the product would reach consumers. And in this transition to a new network, <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/5g-hype-rollout-delays-slow-51551279545\">5G phones are coming out ahead of the network itself</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, Apple doesn&rsquo;t want to risk being too far behind its rivals. So it wisely decided it was time to use up a portion of its massive cash pile to settle all of the mounting litigation with Qualcomm &mdash; plus it will get a write-down.</p>\n<p>The settlement ends litigation that <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-beef-is-all-qualcomm-can-talk-about-2017-04-19\">began in 2017, when Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion</a>, contending that it was demanding onerous terms for use of its patent licenses.<a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-hits-back-at-apple-in-legal-battle-2017-04-11\"> Qualcomm countersued for payments that Apple </a>withheld, leading to lawsuits around the world, as well as battles involving the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not clear what will happen with FTC case, but Moorhead speculated that the FTC will reach a settlement agreement with Qualcomm.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With Apple as the prime complainant to the FTC and with them settling, I think the FTC, as a whole, their case is a lot weaker,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>The big winner is obviously Qualcomm, which many analysts expect to see boosted by an additional windfall of billions dollars from Apple in payments for all the missed royalty revenue. Moody&rsquo;s analyst Richard Lane said in an email that in addition to the future royalty revenue stream, &ldquo;Qualcomm is also likely to receive a significant portion of an estimated $8 billion in catch-up royalty payments, adding yet another favorable boost to the company&rsquo;s bottom line.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Apple will lose some money, but it can afford it with $45 billion in net cash sitting on its books. It also gets to avoid the tedious day-to-day coverage of a jury trial that was hearing opening statements when the settlement was announced. That was probably another factor for the famously secretive Apple, which likely was hoping to avoid another long, costly legal fight like the one it had with Samsung Electronics that ended in its favor in 2018.</p>\n<p>Whenever it was made, the decision by Intel, which wasn&rsquo;t even an actual party in this heavyweight legal battle, should be making Qualcomm an even happier winner.</p>\n<p><em>This article was updated after Intel announced it was getting out of the 5G modem business.</em></p>",

                "text": "Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s surprise settlement agreement Tuesday will result in a huge cash windfall for Qualcomm, and puts Apple on a faster path to 5G for the iPhone.\nThe companies issued a terse joint press release Tuesday that did not disclose any financial terms of a settlement that includes a six-year deal with options for more and payments from Apple. Qualcomm QCOM, +2.23% did add a slide to the news release that it sent reporters and analysts to indicate that it expects an additional $2 a share in profit. Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers estimated, based on that statement, that Qualcomm expects about $2.4 billion as product shipments begin to ramp.\nQualcomm\u2019s shares soared more than 20% in regular trading as the news filtered out. Apple AAPL, +0.82% shares were pretty much flat on the news, since the company will be shelling out possibly several billion dollars in catch-up payments to Qualcomm, plus attorney\u2019s fees, for litigation that has now gone on a little more than two years.\nQualcomm Inc.\nAs part of their agreement, Apple will license future products from Qualcomm directly, instead of having its original equipment manufacturers license chips from the San Diego-based chip maker. Apple signed a six-year licensing agreement, with a two-year option to extend the deal.\nThe big loser in the deal may be neither of the two companies involved. Shares of Intel Corp. INTC, +2.87%, Apple\u2019s current provider of communications chips for the iPhone, slipped in immediate after-hours trading on thoughts that Apple made the deal to avoid solely counting on Intel to make it to 5G. Qualcomm\u2019s first-generation 5G chip platform is expected to power the first 5G phones later this year, and its second-generation 5G chip will sample with customers next quarter and be in products in the first half of 2020.\nPat Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said Apple was \u201cmotivated to negotiate,\u201d as it has fallen behind in adopting the next generation of mobile technology. \u201cThey benefit from an accelerated 5G schedule, a lower-risk 5G schedule,\u201d he said.\nMore from Therese: Salesforce.com buys Salesforce.org, and that\u2019s the only straightforward part\nIntel made it official later Tuesday afternoon, when it issued a statement that it was exiting the 5G modem business, noting that Bob Swan, its new CEO, was reviewing its businesses and \u201cthat it has become apparent that there is no clear path to profitability and positive returns.\u201d Intel said it is still excited about the opportunity for 5G and the \u201ccloudification\u201d of the network. Intel shares shot up more than 4% in after-hours trading following the announcement.\nSeveral analysts speculated on Twitter that Intel\u2019s plans to exit 5G modems may have propelled Apple\u2019s settlement with Qualcomm. Moorhead said it was a positive move for Intel, because it will let the company focus on other, more important, product areas.\nApple was Intel\u2019s biggest customer for wireless communications chips, and Intel\u2019s delay in 5G had put additional pressure on Apple, which is already dealing with slower growth in its once-exploding iPhone business. Many of its rivals are launching 5G smartphones, which were all the talk of the latest Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but some of the recent unveilings lacked a date as to when the product would reach consumers. And in this transition to a new network, 5G phones are coming out ahead of the network itself.\nStill, Apple doesn\u2019t want to risk being too far behind its rivals. So it wisely decided it was time to use up a portion of its massive cash pile to settle all of the mounting litigation with Qualcomm \u2014 plus it will get a write-down.\nThe settlement ends litigation that began in 2017, when Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion, contending that it was demanding onerous terms for use of its patent licenses. Qualcomm countersued for payments that Apple withheld, leading to lawsuits around the world, as well as battles involving the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\nIt\u2019s not clear what will happen with FTC case, but Moorhead speculated that the FTC will reach a settlement agreement with Qualcomm.\n\u201cWith Apple as the prime complainant to the FTC and with them settling, I think the FTC, as a whole, their case is a lot weaker,\u201d he said.\nThe big winner is obviously Qualcomm, which many analysts expect to see boosted by an additional windfall of billions dollars from Apple in payments for all the missed royalty revenue. Moody\u2019s analyst Richard Lane said in an email that in addition to the future royalty revenue stream, \u201cQualcomm is also likely to receive a significant portion of an estimated $8 billion in catch-up royalty payments, adding yet another favorable boost to the company\u2019s bottom line.\u201d\nApple will lose some money, but it can afford it with $45 billion in net cash sitting on its books. It also gets to avoid the tedious day-to-day coverage of a jury trial that was hearing opening statements when the settlement was announced. That was probably another factor for the famously secretive Apple, which likely was hoping to avoid another long, costly legal fight like the one it had with Samsung Electronics that ended in its favor in 2018.\nWhenever it was made, the decision by Intel, which wasn\u2019t even an actual party in this heavyweight legal battle, should be making Qualcomm an even happier winner.\nThis article was updated after Intel announced it was getting out of the 5G modem business.",

The gauge rose 0.2% in December vs. November and 4.2% from year ago &mdash; the slowest pace of annual growth since 2014.</p>\n<p>Smith said that bursting bubbles tend to follow a symmetrical reversal in terms of time durations and magnitudes of their initial rise.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If the bubble took four years to inflate and rose by X, the retrace tends to take about the same length of time and tends to retrace much or all of X,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>\n<p>He used this chart of the Case-Shiller Housing Index as an example:</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2019/02/26/Photos/NS/MW-HE600_CaseSh_20190226110901_NS.png?uuid=d4c49eae-39e0-11e9-8839-ac162d7bc1f7\"></img>    </figure>\n<p>Smith explained that the Fed, by dropping interest rates to near-zero and buying mortgage-backed securities, didn&rsquo;t allow the first bubble on the chart to run its course. This time around, however, there are &ldquo;no more saves in the Fed&rsquo;s locker,&rdquo; he warned, adding that this decline will start this year and end around 2025.</p>\n<p>But which path will it take?</p>\n<p>Smith said the more realistic analysts out there would at least agree that <em>some</em> declines in prices is a possibility, and that it would look like the milder scenario.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s now how he sees it though.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is a good case for Scenario 2, in which price plummets below the 2012 lows and keeps on going, ultimately retracing the entire housing bubble gains from 2003,&rdquo; he said, laying out several factors, such as massive student debt, insufficient income to support nosebleed prices, the exit of Chinese buyers, etc.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The economy has changed, and the sacrifices required to buy a house in hot markets at today&rsquo;s prices make no sense,&rdquo; Smith concluded. &ldquo;The only question of any real interest is how low prices will drop by 2025. We&rsquo;re so accustomed to being surprised on the upside that we&rsquo;ve forgotten we can surprised on the downside as well.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.mktw.net/_newsimages/2014_dreds/shawnLanglois_480.png\"></img><figcaption>Shawn Langlois is an editor and writer for MarketWatch in Los Angeles.

The gauge rose 0.2% in December vs. November and 4.2% from year ago \u2014 the slowest pace of annual growth since 2014.\nSmith said that bursting bubbles tend to follow a symmetrical reversal in terms of time durations and magnitudes of their initial rise.\n\u201cIf the bubble took four years to inflate and rose by X, the retrace tends to take about the same length of time and tends to retrace much or all of X,\u201d he wrote.\nHe used this chart of the Case-Shiller Housing Index as an example:\nSmith explained that the Fed, by dropping interest rates to near-zero and buying mortgage-backed securities, didn\u2019t allow the first bubble on the chart to run its course. This time around, however, there are \u201cno more saves in the Fed\u2019s locker,\u201d he warned, adding that this decline will start this year and end around 2025.\nBut which path will it take?\nSmith said the more realistic analysts out there would at least agree that some declines in prices is a possibility, and that it would look like the milder scenario.\nThat\u2019s now how he sees it though.\n\u201cThere is a good case for Scenario 2, in which price plummets below the 2012 lows and keeps on going, ultimately retracing the entire housing bubble gains from 2003,\u201d he said, laying out several factors, such as massive student debt, insufficient income to support nosebleed prices, the exit of Chinese buyers, etc.\n\u201cThe economy has changed, and the sacrifices required to buy a house in hot markets at today\u2019s prices make no sense,\u201d Smith concluded. \u201cThe only question of any real interest is how low prices will drop by 2025. We\u2019re so accustomed to being surprised on the upside that we\u2019ve forgotten we can surprised on the downside as well.\u201d",

But does that mean the Fed will come off the sidelines later this year, and hurt stock investors the same way it did in late 2018?</p>\n<p>Those are the two provocative questions posed by Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Ian Shepherdson, arguing that the stock market is getting too complacent about the idea that the central bank will let the economy run hot because forces pushing the U.S toward a slowdown are so strong.</p>\n<p>There really are two questions. First, is the economy running hot, or will it soon? Only then can you answer the second: What should you (the reader) do about it?</p>\n<blockquote data-share-hover=\"true\" data-share-modprefix=\"mw_pullquote_\" data-share-text=\"The economic slowdown looks like a hiccup \u2014 but then what?\"> &ldquo;The scene is set for a much more difficult second half of the year for markets, which are very happy with the idea that the Fed is never raising rates again.&rdquo;  </blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I buy the idea that the market seems to like,&rdquo; said Shepherdson, a two-time winner of the Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s annual forecasting competition. &ldquo;The scene is set for a much more difficult second half of the year for markets, which are very happy with the idea that the Fed is never raising rates again.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of dispute &mdash; about the markets, the Fed and the economy itself.</p>\n<p>75% chance the Fed is on hold</p>\n<p>CME FedWatch says futures prices project 75% odds that Fed won&rsquo;t raise rates through December. Goldman Sachs lowered its estimate of first-quarter economic growth to an annualized rate of 0.4% last week &mdash; way below the 2.9% annual rate for 2018 President Donald Trump bragged about on Twitter this weekend, when he wasn&rsquo;t ranting about 12 &ldquo;Jexodus&rdquo; pilgrims, 11 Fox News hosts, 10 General Motors factories, nine climate changes, eight John McCains, seven &ldquo;emergencies&rdquo; at the border, six Robert Mueller rumors...</p>\n<p>FIVE DOSS-I-ERS!!!</p>\n<p>Four union leaders, three states with flooding, two mosques full of Muslims shot dead by a nutcase who, like the president, thinks immigrants are invaders&hellip;.</p>\n<p>And a rerun of Saturday Night Live!</p>\n<p>Or something. Whatever. <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-today-president-attacks-biden-pressures-gm-as-tweeting-slows-following-frantic-weekend-2019-03-18\">It was Trump</a>, so it didn&rsquo;t make sense. And it didn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>\n<p>But this is not a column about Trump. It&rsquo;s about reality, so his name shan&rsquo;t appear again.</p>\n<p>Shaky manufacturing numbers</p>\n<p>Goldman&rsquo;s point was primarily about manufacturing, and was prompted by a weak reading on Empire State manufacturing index &mdash; the latest of a series of shaky numbers about manufacturing, accompanied by a handful about consumer spending, including a 1.6% drop in December retail sales that raised some concern that the government shutdown might have broken some of the economy&rsquo;s momentum.</p>\n<p>Pair that with surveys showing a rising share of business economists <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/graphics/econsurvey/\">expect a growth slowdown this year,</a> and many think a 2020 recession is even possible, and you can see why <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html\">the markets expect the Fed t</a>o be out of the business of raising interest rates well beyond the meeting that begins today and wraps up Wednesday with an announcement at 2 p.m. Eastern and a press conference by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30.</p>\n<p>But Shepherdson makes a strong case that the factors behind the slowdown are transitory, and that the consumer part of the economy is still on a trajectory for growth in the 2% to 2.5% range, about a third slower than in mid-2018. Mid-2018&rsquo;s spending growth was driven by the 2017 tax cut, the effects of which have already faded, and a drop in gasoline prices that have begun to move in the other direction, he argues.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to look bad for a while, but it&rsquo;s dangerous to extrapolate,&rdquo; Shepherdson said. With incomes growing about 2.5%, that&rsquo;s a good pace for consumer spending to grow, he says. &ldquo;The consumer is pretty much back to where they were before the tax cut.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Similarly, Shepherdson sees manufacturing growth normalizing, if not surging, as the U.S. and China defuse trade tensions and a Chinese stimulus takes root by midyear, stabilizing demand for U.S. exports hurt by both the threat of new tariffs and China&rsquo;s recent growth slowdown.</p>\n<p>With both major forces that have been slowing U.S. growth set to dissipate, Shepherdson reasons, that means tightening labor markets should be forcing wage growth to levels the Fed finds uncomfortable by later this year.</p>\n<p>Watch out for the Fed</p>\n<p>Does that put everyone back in late-2018&rsquo;s soup &mdash; after a quarter in which the S&amp;P 500 <a data-fancyid=\"SPUSIndexSPX\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote\">SPX, +1.13%</a> lost 14% of its value?</p>\n<p>Maybe, says Shepherdson &mdash; it&rsquo;s a risk big enough to watch out for.</p>\n<p>Or, maybe not &mdash; if the Fed is steely enough to wait for inflation to begin rising tangibly past the central bank&rsquo;s 2% annual target before raising rates.</p>\n<p>Plenty of big banks&rsquo; economists and strategists think Shepherdson is off base.</p>\n<p>Credit Suisse just raised its 2019 price target for the S&amp;P to predict a 20% gain this year, saying the risks that tanked the markets are now receding &mdash; which is Shepherdson&rsquo;s point, minus the part about the Fed.</p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley said the recent rise in the Dow Jones Industrials <a data-fancyid=\"DowJonesGlobalIndexDJIA\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote\">DJIA, +1.68%</a> and other averages has markets appropriately valued again.

                "text": "The recent blip toward economic slowdown \u2014 which assured the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t raise interest rates this week \u2014 won\u2019t last. But does that mean the Fed will come off the sidelines later this year, and hurt stock investors the same way it did in late 2018?\nThose are the two provocative questions posed by Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Ian Shepherdson, arguing that the stock market is getting too complacent about the idea that the central bank will let the economy run hot because forces pushing the U.S toward a slowdown are so strong.\nThere really are two questions. First, is the economy running hot, or will it soon? Only then can you answer the second: What should you (the reader) do about it?\n\u201cThe scene is set for a much more difficult second half of the year for markets, which are very happy with the idea that the Fed is never raising rates again.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I buy the idea that the market seems to like,\u201d said Shepherdson, a two-time winner of the Wall Street Journal\u2019s annual forecasting competition. \u201cThe scene is set for a much more difficult second half of the year for markets, which are very happy with the idea that the Fed is never raising rates again.\u201d\nThere\u2019s plenty of dispute \u2014 about the markets, the Fed and the economy itself.\n75% chance the Fed is on hold\nCME FedWatch says futures prices project 75% odds that Fed won\u2019t raise rates through December. Goldman Sachs lowered its estimate of first-quarter economic growth to an annualized rate of 0.4% last week \u2014 way below the 2.9% annual rate for 2018 President Donald Trump bragged about on Twitter this weekend, when he wasn\u2019t ranting about 12 \u201cJexodus\u201d pilgrims, 11 Fox News hosts, 10 General Motors factories, nine climate changes, eight John McCains, seven \u201cemergencies\u201d at the border, six Robert Mueller rumors...\nFIVE DOSS-I-ERS!!!\nFour union leaders, three states with flooding, two mosques full of Muslims shot dead by a nutcase who, like the president, thinks immigrants are invaders\u2026.\nAnd a rerun of Saturday Night Live!\nOr something. Whatever. It was Trump, so it didn\u2019t make sense. And it didn\u2019t really matter.\nBut this is not a column about Trump. It\u2019s about reality, so his name shan\u2019t appear again.\nShaky manufacturing numbers\nGoldman\u2019s point was primarily about manufacturing, and was prompted by a weak reading on Empire State manufacturing index \u2014 the latest of a series of shaky numbers about manufacturing, accompanied by a handful about consumer spending, including a 1.6% drop in December retail sales that raised some concern that the government shutdown might have broken some of the economy\u2019s momentum.\nPair that with surveys showing a rising share of business economists expect a growth slowdown this year, and many think a 2020 recession is even possible, and you can see why the markets expect the Fed to be out of the business of raising interest rates well beyond the meeting that begins today and wraps up Wednesday with an announcement at 2 p.m. Eastern and a press conference by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30.\nBut Shepherdson makes a strong case that the factors behind the slowdown are transitory, and that the consumer part of the economy is still on a trajectory for growth in the 2% to 2.5% range, about a third slower than in mid-2018. Mid-2018\u2019s spending growth was driven by the 2017 tax cut, the effects of which have already faded, and a drop in gasoline prices that have begun to move in the other direction, he argues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to look bad for a while, but it\u2019s dangerous to extrapolate,\u201d Shepherdson said. With incomes growing about 2.5%, that\u2019s a good pace for consumer spending to grow, he says. \u201cThe consumer is pretty much back to where they were before the tax cut.\u201d\nSimilarly, Shepherdson sees manufacturing growth normalizing, if not surging, as the U.S. and China defuse trade tensions and a Chinese stimulus takes root by midyear, stabilizing demand for U.S. exports hurt by both the threat of new tariffs and China\u2019s recent growth slowdown.\nWith both major forces that have been slowing U.S. growth set to dissipate, Shepherdson reasons, that means tightening labor markets should be forcing wage growth to levels the Fed finds uncomfortable by later this year.\nWatch out for the Fed\nDoes that put everyone back in late-2018\u2019s soup \u2014 after a quarter in which the S&P 500 SPX, +1.13% lost 14% of its value?\nMaybe, says Shepherdson \u2014 it\u2019s a risk big enough to watch out for.\nOr, maybe not \u2014 if the Fed is steely enough to wait for inflation to begin rising tangibly past the central bank\u2019s 2% annual target before raising rates.\nPlenty of big banks\u2019 economists and strategists think Shepherdson is off base.\nCredit Suisse just raised its 2019 price target for the S&P to predict a 20% gain this year, saying the risks that tanked the markets are now receding \u2014 which is Shepherdson\u2019s point, minus the part about the Fed.\nMorgan Stanley said the recent rise in the Dow Jones Industrials DJIA, +1.68% and other averages has markets appropriately valued again. And asset manager BlackRock wants more proof of China\u2019s rebound before endorsing that part of the story.\nSo if today\u2019s Fed meeting seems boring \u2014 they\u2019re not going to raise rates, says nearly everybody \u2014 don\u2019t get lulled to sleep.\nThe stakes will be rising again soon enough.",

Members of Congress have expressed concern about the thousands of civilians killed in coalition airstrikes since the conflict began in 2014. The fighting in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country also has left millions suffering from food and medical care shortages and has pushed the country to the brink of famine.\nHouse approval of the resolution came earlier this month on a 247-175 vote. The Senate vote last month was 54-46.\nDemocratic Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, voted to end U.S. military assistance to the war, saying the humanitarian crisis in Yemen triggered \u201cdemands moral leadership.\u201d\nThe top Republican on the committee, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, acknowledged the dire situation in Yemen for civilians, but spoke out in opposition to the bill. McCaul said it was an abuse of the War Powers Resolution and predicted it could disrupt U.S. security cooperation agreements with more than 100 countries.\nTrump issued his first veto last month on legislation related to immigration. Trump had declared a national emergency so he could use more money to construct a border wall. Congress voted to block the emergency declaration and Trump vetoed that measure.",

The budget airline&rsquo;s entrance into the market could lead fares to the state to decrease by 30% across all carriers, an analysis published by Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani found.</p>\n<p>The airline has said it will start offering low-cost flights to the islands by the end of 2019. It plans to open up flights at four airports there: Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu (HNL), Kahului Airport on Maui (OGG), Lihue Airport on Kauai (LIH), and Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport at Keahole (KOA) on the leeward side of The Island of Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Southwest <a data-fancyid=\"XNYSStockLUV\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/luv?mod=MW_story_quote\">LUV, +1.35%</a> did not respond to request for comment, but confirmed the <a href=\"https://www.swamedia.com/releases/release-bc94d941a090ea44998912da1f36c353-southwest-airlines-completes-first-validation-flight-to-hawaii\">first test touchdown at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport</a> in a press release on Feb. 5. One-way fares to Hawaii currently hover around $200, the Morgan Stanley report said, but Southwest has hinted at entry-level fares of $100-140 from California. This could have major effects on other carriers there, including Alaska <a data-fancyid=\"XNYSStockALK\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/alk?mod=MW_story_quote\">ALK, -3.48%</a> and Hawaiian <a data-fancyid=\"XNASStockHA\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ha?mod=MW_story_quote\">HA, -3.97%</a> airlines, the report said.</p>\n<p>The market in Hawaii is complicated, said Christopher Elliott, airline expert and consumer advocate at Elliott.org, and it&rsquo;s difficult to say if these new flights will bring down all costs. Costs of inter-island flights will likely be more significantly affected than those between the continental U.S. and Hawaii, he said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The flights within the islands will be more competitive, as they are more expensive historically,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I would expect prices in some markets will go down but not in all of them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hawaii is historically a tricky market to enter, Elliott said. Allegiant Air <a data-fancyid=\"XNASStockALGT\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/algt?mod=MW_story_quote\">ALGT, -2.31%</a> previously tried to expand to the area in 2012 but started phasing out the flights by 2015 and ended the route entirely by 2017. The <a href=\"https://beatofhawaii.com/goodbye-allegiant-air-hawaii/\">long flight over the Pacific Ocean</a> requires additional maintenance of planes and flying between islands to small airports can be complicated as well, he said.</p>\n<p>Southwest will be adding 17 planes over the next 12 to 18 months, the Morgan Stanley report said, and price reductions are expected by mid to late 2020.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When it comes to Hawaii, Southwest is in a unique position as the disruptor,&rdquo; the report said.</p>\n<p>Shares of Southwest were down 7.7% over the past 12 months as of Wednesday, compared to a 2.4% increase for the Dow Jones Industrial Average <a data-fancyid=\"DowJonesGlobalIndexDJIA\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote\">DJIA, +0.30%</a> and a 1.82% increase for the S&amp;P 500 <a data-fancyid=\"SPUSIndexSPX\" data-track-mod=\"MW_story_quote\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote\">SPX, +0.33%</a> .</p>",

                "text": "Traveling to the Hawaiian islands could soon be easier \u2014 and less expensive.\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Aviation Administration granted approval to Southwest Airlines to expand routes there. The budget airline\u2019s entrance into the market could lead fares to the state to decrease by 30% across all carriers, an analysis published by Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani found.\nThe airline has said it will start offering low-cost flights to the islands by the end of 2019. It plans to open up flights at four airports there: Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu (HNL), Kahului Airport on Maui (OGG), Lihue Airport on Kauai (LIH), and Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport at Keahole (KOA) on the leeward side of The Island of Hawaii.\nSouthwest LUV, +1.35% did not respond to request for comment, but confirmed the first test touchdown at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in a press release on Feb. 5. One-way fares to Hawaii currently hover around $200, the Morgan Stanley report said, but Southwest has hinted at entry-level fares of $100-140 from California. This could have major effects on other carriers there, including Alaska ALK, -3.48% and Hawaiian HA, -3.97% airlines, the report said.\nThe market in Hawaii is complicated, said Christopher Elliott, airline expert and consumer advocate at Elliott.org, and it\u2019s difficult to say if these new flights will bring down all costs. Costs of inter-island flights will likely be more significantly affected than those between the continental U.S. and Hawaii, he said.\n\u201cThe flights within the islands will be more competitive, as they are more expensive historically,\u201d he said. \u201cI would expect prices in some markets will go down but not in all of them.\u201d\nHawaii is historically a tricky market to enter, Elliott said. Allegiant Air ALGT, -2.31% previously tried to expand to the area in 2012 but started phasing out the flights by 2015 and ended the route entirely by 2017. The long flight over the Pacific Ocean requires additional maintenance of planes and flying between islands to small airports can be complicated as well, he said.\nSouthwest will be adding 17 planes over the next 12 to 18 months, the Morgan Stanley report said, and price reductions are expected by mid to late 2020.\n\u201cWhen it comes to Hawaii, Southwest is in a unique position as the disruptor,\u201d the report said.\nShares of Southwest were down 7.7% over the past 12 months as of Wednesday, compared to a 2.4% increase for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.30% and a 1.82% increase for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.33% .",

Or perhaps not all, but a lot.</p>\n<p>Now a confessed felon who will soon reside in a federal prison, Cohen spent a decade as Trump&rsquo;s consigliere and attack-dog defender. He famously once proclaimed he would take a bullet for his patron. Yet now Cohen has traded the tough-guy pose for contrition, explaining that he lost his way during his years with Trump. (Cohen, according to federal prosecutors, acted &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/07/government-implicates-trump-trump-campaign-federal-campaign-finance-law-violations/?utm_term=.4b83ff523c66\">in coordination with and at the direction of</a>&rdquo; Trump, when he violated campaign finance laws by making hush money payments to a <em>Playboy</em> model and a porn star who each claimed to have had an extramarital affair with Trump.) And as part of his penance, he wants to <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michael-cohen-plans-give-america-peek-trump-tower/story?id=61106078\">share</a> with the world his intimate knowledge of Trump and his immoral and dishonest conduct.</p>\n<p>There is practically a bottomless pit of questions that members of the committee can hurl at Cohen. His lawyer, Lanny Davis, says that Cohen will not address Russian matters. But it&rsquo;s not clear how tight that restraint will be. And, of course, the legislators are free to ask whatever they want. (It&rsquo;s a good bet at least one of the Democratic lawmakers will raise with Cohen the allegation he secretly met with Russian officials in Prague in the summer of 2016&mdash;which he has steadfastly denied.) Even with that limit in place, Cohen can be grilled on a host of subjects related to Trump&rsquo;s business dealings going back years. There remain many unanswered questions about the president&rsquo;s finances and his endeavors around the globe. And there likely are schemes and ventures still unknown to the public that warrant scrutiny. So of course, Cohen should be asked big, open-ended questions, such as this one: During your time with Trump, did you witness any criminal or improper activity by Trump, his relatives, or employees of his company? But here is a <em>partial</em> list of specific queries for Cohen that members of the oversight panel may want to pose. They cover some of the known mysteries and puzzles of Trumpland. No doubt, there are plenty of questions that could be added to this compendium. Yet getting straight answers to these would be a very good start.</p>\n<h3><strong>Trump&rsquo;s Finances</strong></h3>\n<p>Have Trump&rsquo;s taxes really been under <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-taxreturns/as-democrats-target-trumps-tax-returns-audit-claims-loom-large-idUSKCN1PP314\">audit, as he has repeatedly claimed?</a> If so, which years?

If so, what did he say about that?</p>\n<p>In your private conversations with Trump, how did he refer to Vladimir Putin and what did he say about him? Can you explain Trump&rsquo;s long record of making positive statements about Putin?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/donald-trump-russia-sergei-millian/\">Sergei Millian</a>, a somewhat mysterious real estate developer, has <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/miami-beach/article82336357.html\">claimed</a> he <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mysterious-key-figure-russia-probe-sought-trump-team/story?id=57458553\">worked</a> with the Trump Organization, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Russian-Roulette-Inside-America-Election-ebook/dp/B075WVX3MS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=thedaical-20&linkId=f97270a1e53154a88f81dc3bed1f4b7c\">he was an unwitting</a> source for salacious allegations in the Steele dossier. You have publicly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sergei-millian-identified-as-an-unwitting-source-for-the-steele-dossier-sought-proximity-to-trumps-world-in-2016/2019/02/06/c7465a52-ec19-11e8-8679-934a2b33be52_story.html?utm_term=.40c765c31adf\">said</a> he is a &ldquo;total phony.&rdquo; Is that true? Or did he have a connection to Trump and his circle?</p>\n<p>Donald Trump Jr. has said that Russian money was an important revenue stream for the Trump Organization. How so? How much money has the Trump Organization gotten from real estate deals with Russians?</p>\n<p>Which Trump projects have received the most money from Russians?</p>\n<p>What was the general attitude in the Trump Organization toward obtaining Russian money or buyers?</p>\n<p>Eric Trump reportedly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/eric-trump-russia-investment-golf-course\">told</a> a sports writer that the Trump Organization financed its golf course with Russian money. Is that accurate? If so, what Russian money?</p>\n<p>When Trump purchased his golf courses in Scotland, he <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/10/new-filing-trumps-scottish-golf-course-lost-4-5-million-last-year/\">broke</a> from his usual course of action of financing big acquisitions with debt. He bought them with cash. Where did the cash come from?</p>\n<h3><strong>Trump Tower Moscow</strong></h3>\n<p>Why did Trump in December 2015 <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/09/how-donald-trump-lied-to-conceal-his-moscow-business-partner/\">lie</a> about his relationship with Felix Sater, a real estate developer with a felony conviction? <a href=\"https://apnews.com/29c255c0b69a48258ecae69a61612537\">Asked</a> by a reporter about Sater, Trump <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/06/trump-felix-sater-andrew-weissman/\">said,</a> &ldquo;Felix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it. I&rsquo;m not that familiar with him.&rdquo; Yet at the time, Sater was <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/11/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-discussed-business-deal-with-putins-office/\">working</a> with you to develop a Trump tower in Moscow, and Trump had <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/trump-moscow-micheal-cohen-felix-sater-campaign#.svxNggnj7\">signed</a> a letter of intent in October 2015 regarding the project. Was Trump trying to hide this project from the public as he was campaigning for president?</p>\n<p>Did Trump ever discuss with you the need to keep this project secret? Or the need to hide his relationship with Sater, who had previously worked with the Trump Organization on the Trump SoHo project and other prospective projects?</p>\n<p>When did work on the Trump tower Moscow project officially cease? And why did it come to an end?</p>\n<p>How aware were Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump of this venture? Did you brief them on the project?</p>\n<p>Did you know that IC Expert, the Russian company in this deal, was <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Tzc3DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT98&lpg=PT98&dq=three+offshore+companies+ic+expert+moscow&source=bl&ots=fXEQCDpLJw&sig=ACfU3U32uK9W-OJJYlpd-Ie_PS3LL3as1A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjL_dKh8NfgAhVHGt8KHXAqCD8Q6AEwBHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=three%20offshore%20companies%20ic%20expert%20moscow&f=false\">owned</a> by three offshore companies, with one controlled by a Cypriot lawyer deeply involved in Russian finance? Do you know who ultimately controlled IC Expert?</p>\n<p>One of the now-famous memos written by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele alleged that the Russians attempted to cultivate and co-opt Trump by dangling business opportunities in front of him. Do you think that is true?</p>\n<h3><strong>Saudi Arabia/United Arab Emirates</strong></h3>\n<p>How <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/10/donald-trump-has-a-serious-saudi-arabian-conflict-of-interest/\">much</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-and-saudi-arabia-deep-business-ties-spark-new-scrutiny/\">business</a> has the Trump Organization done with Saudi Arabian entities?</p>\n<p>Has Trump conducted (or tried to conduct) any business with the Saudi royal family?</p>\n<p>Who was Trump&rsquo;s partner on the Trump Organization <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danielwagner/trumps-saudi-business\">plan</a> to open a hotel in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia?</p>\n<p>Does Trump or his family own or control any property in Dubai or elsewhere in the United Arab Emirates?</p>\n<h3><strong>China</strong></h3>\n<p>Can you describe what you know, if anything, about the 2017 deal in which a woman with apparent ties to Chinese military intelligence <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/exclusive-donald-trump-penthouse-buyer-has-ties-group-chinese-military-intelligence/\">bought</a> a $16 million condo in New York City from Trump&rsquo;s company? Was Trump aware of this transaction?</p>\n<p>Were you aware of Trump Organization efforts to do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/08/china-approves-trump-trademarks-businesses\">business</a> in China? What happened with these attempts?</p>\n<h3><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong></h3>\n<p>Trump has borrowed at least <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/donald-trump-and-deutsche-bank/\">$364 million</a> from Deutsche Bank. Can you explain his <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/trumps-conflict-interest-big-overseas-bank-getting-worse-minute/\">relationship</a> with this bank?</p>\n<p>How much money has he borrowed from this institution?</p>\n<p>The funds for these loans come from the private side of the German bank&mdash;that is, a division of the bank that caters to high-net-worth clients, for instance, by offering them riskier loans than the bank would usually allow. Do you know the ultimate source of the money? Is there any connection between these borrowed funds and Russian or other foreign interests?</p>\n<p>During the 2016 campaign, Trump asked Deutsche Bank for a new loan and was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/business/trump-deutsche-bank.html\">rejected</a>. Did he approach any other banks for money?</p>\n<p>Does Trump have any other major loans from overseas banks and sources? Has he ever?</p>\n<h3><strong>Trump SoHo</strong></h3>\n<p>Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump were <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-ivanka-trump-and-donald-trump-jr-avoided-a-criminal-indictment\">accused</a> of misleading prospective buyers about sales in the Trump SoHo hotel and condominium project. Do you know if they did provide false information to possible buyers?</p>\n<p>The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., dropped the case. Was this move related to campaign donations received by the DA?</p>\n<p>One lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/us/politics/donald-trump-soho-settlement.html\">claimed</a> Trump SoHo was developed with the undisclosed help of convicted felons and was financed by shady sources in Kazakhstan and Russia. Is this true?</p>\n<p>Do you know of any examples of improper financing of that project or if any financing for it came from sources related to Russia or organized crime?</p>\n<p>Do you know of any examples when Trump, his relatives, the Trump Organization, or the firm&rsquo;s associates sought financing from questionable sources or sources linked to corrupt foreign officials or criminal activity?</p>\n<h3><strong>Ukraine Peace Plans and Russian Sanctions</strong></h3>\n<p>Before or after the election, did you ever talk with Trump about lifting the economic sanctions imposed on Russia? Was this ever part of any quid pro quo?</p>\n<p>Was the so-called Ukrainian peace plan <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html\">you shared</a> with then national security adviser Michael Flynn in the early days of the Trump administration related to the plan Paul Manafort reportedly discussed with Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime Manafort business associate?</p>\n<p>Did you receive any business rewards or other gains for passing along this Ukraine plan?</p>\n<p>Were you or Trump aware of Manafort&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/emails-suggest-manafort-sought-approval-from-putin-ally-deripaska/541677/\">relationship</a> with Oleg Deripaska and Manafort&rsquo;s interactions with Kilimnik, an alleged Russian intelligence associate, during the campaign?</p>\n<h3><strong>The Post-election Swamp</strong></h3>\n<p>After Trump&rsquo;s election, you set up a lobbying and consulting business. Was Trump aware of your activities? Did he help you secure any of the lucrative contracts you obtained? Did you have or discuss with him any financial agreement under which he would receive a portion of your earnings? Did he offer to repay any debts to you by helping you secure business?</p>\n<p>Was Trump aware of your <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/russian-billionaire-viktor-vekselberg-met-with-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-days-before-the-inauguration/2018/05/25/ab18eadc-602a-11e8-9ee3-49d6d4814c4c_story.html?utm_term=.5836cea63583\">work</a> with Columbus Nova, an American firm linked to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg? Did you ever introduce Vekselberg to Trump or convey to Trump any message from him?</p>\n<p>Did you <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/02/a-swamp-story-trump-encouraged-a-foreign-official-to-back-a-donors-business-deal/\">discuss</a> with Trump the effort of Franklin Haney, a Republican donor, to secure funding for a nuclear power plant project from the Qatar Investment Authority? Did Trump help you <a href=\"https://dailymemphian.com/article/1174/POWER-BROKER\">secure</a> a contract with Haney to help Haney seek Qatari funding?</p>\n<h3><strong>Finally</strong></h3>\n<p>Where <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/421229-swalwell-michael-cohen-knows-where-all-the-bodies-are-buried\">are</a> the bodies buried?</p>",

                "text": "On Wednesday, Michael Cohen, the once influential lawyer and fixer for Donald Trump, will testify in public before the House Oversight Committee and tell all. Or perhaps not all, but a lot.\nNow a confessed felon who will soon reside in a federal prison, Cohen spent a decade as Trump\u2019s consigliere and attack-dog defender. He famously once proclaimed he would take a bullet for his patron. Yet now Cohen has traded the tough-guy pose for contrition, explaining that he lost his way during his years with Trump. (Cohen, according to federal prosecutors, acted \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of\u201d Trump, when he violated campaign finance laws by making hush money payments to a Playboy model and a porn star who each claimed to have had an extramarital affair with Trump.) And as part of his penance, he wants to share with the world his intimate knowledge of Trump and his immoral and dishonest conduct.\nThere is practically a bottomless pit of questions that members of the committee can hurl at Cohen. His lawyer, Lanny Davis, says that Cohen will not address Russian matters. But it\u2019s not clear how tight that restraint will be. And, of course, the legislators are free to ask whatever they want. (It\u2019s a good bet at least one of the Democratic lawmakers will raise with Cohen the allegation he secretly met with Russian officials in Prague in the summer of 2016\u2014which he has steadfastly denied.) Even with that limit in place, Cohen can be grilled on a host of subjects related to Trump\u2019s business dealings going back years. There remain many unanswered questions about the president\u2019s finances and his endeavors around the globe. And there likely are schemes and ventures still unknown to the public that warrant scrutiny. So of course, Cohen should be asked big, open-ended questions, such as this one: During your time with Trump, did you witness any criminal or improper activity by Trump, his relatives, or employees of his company? But here is a partial list of specific queries for Cohen that members of the oversight panel may want to pose. They cover some of the known mysteries and puzzles of Trumpland. No doubt, there are plenty of questions that could be added to this compendium. Yet getting straight answers to these would be a very good start.\nTrump\u2019s Finances\nHave Trump\u2019s taxes really been under audit, as he has repeatedly claimed? If so, which years? Is that really why he has not released them? Have you ever talked to him about releasing his taxes? Are there any particular reasons he does not want the public to see his returns?\nThe New York Times reported that Trump and his family engaged in tax avoidance schemes and outright fraud in the 1990s to avoid paying hundreds of millions of dollars of taxes. Have you ever discussed these or similar schemes with him? Do you know anything about this conduct?\nHas Donald Trump lied about his net worth? Any idea what it is?\nHas the Trump Organization engaged in hiding assets in offshore companies? Has it used limited liability corporations (LLCs) in the United States to hide liabilities or assets?\nAre you familiar with the workings of the Trump Foundation? Did Trump or any members of his family use the foundation improperly? For personal gain?\nDid you ever have any conversations with Trump about how he could use his campaign to make money for the Trump Organization and his family (or you)?\nDid you ever have any conversations with Trump about how he could use the presidency to make money for the Trump Organization and his family (or you)?\nIt was recently reported that you gave information to federal prosecutors about possible irregularities related to insurance claims filed by the Trump Organization. Can you explain what material you provided?\nOn a financial disclosure form, Trump stated that he owed an entity called \u201cChicago Unit Acquisition LLC\u201d $50 million. On the same form, he listed this LLC as an asset he owned but claimed it had no value\u2014which seemed odd. So what is the story behind this mysterious loan?\nTrump Skullduggery\nWere you involved in any other hush money payments beyond those for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels?\nHas Trump ever been the target of extortion or blackmail from individuals or foreign entities?\nDo you know if he ever engaged in behavior while traveling abroad, including in Russia, that would leave him vulnerable to blackmail?\nDo you know if the Trump Organization ever violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?\nDid Trump\u2019s company meet its obligation to perform due diligence on its local partners on foreign ventures, including its Azerbaijan licensing deal?\nDid you have any conversations with Trump, Trump campaign officials, or Trump Organization executives about trying to locate Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails?\nProsecutors are investigating whether the Trump campaign received illegal donations from foreign donors. Around the time of the inauguration, you negotiated lucrative deals to help secure access to the new president\u2019s administration for foreign nationals, including some now suspected of secretly funneling money to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. You were also involved in communication among Trump staffers about alleged overspending by the committee (including Ivanka Trump\u2019s apparent role in steering inaugural dollars to Trump\u2019s Washington hotel). So what do you know about donations to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee? Did any money come from foreign sources? Were any donations made to seek influence with Trump and his administration?\nHave you ever discussed with Trump his links to organized crime figures?\nRussia\nWere you aware of the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016? And do you know if Trump was aware of it after or before it occurred?\nWere you ever informed that the Kremlin or other Russian entities wanted to secretly help the Trump campaign?\nDid you ever talk to Trump about denying Russian intervention in the 2016 campaign? If so, what did he say about that?\nIn your private conversations with Trump, how did he refer to Vladimir Putin and what did he say about him? Can you explain Trump\u2019s long record of making positive statements about Putin?\nSergei Millian, a somewhat mysterious real estate developer, has claimed he worked with the Trump Organization, and he was an unwitting source for salacious allegations in the Steele dossier. You have publicly said he is a \u201ctotal phony.\u201d Is that true? Or did he have a connection to Trump and his circle?\nDonald Trump Jr. has said that Russian money was an important revenue stream for the Trump Organization. How so? How much money has the Trump Organization gotten from real estate deals with Russians?\nWhich Trump projects have received the most money from Russians?\nWhat was the general attitude in the Trump Organization toward obtaining Russian money or buyers?\nEric Trump reportedly told a sports writer that the Trump Organization financed its golf course with Russian money. Is that accurate? If so, what Russian money?\nWhen Trump purchased his golf courses in Scotland, he broke from his usual course of action of financing big acquisitions with debt. He bought them with cash. Where did the cash come from?\nTrump Tower Moscow\nWhy did Trump in December 2015 lie about his relationship with Felix Sater, a real estate developer with a felony conviction? Asked by a reporter about Sater, Trump said, \u201cFelix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it. I\u2019m not that familiar with him.\u201d Yet at the time, Sater was working with you to develop a Trump tower in Moscow, and Trump had signed a letter of intent in October 2015 regarding the project. Was Trump trying to hide this project from the public as he was campaigning for president?\nDid Trump ever discuss with you the need to keep this project secret? Or the need to hide his relationship with Sater, who had previously worked with the Trump Organization on the Trump SoHo project and other prospective projects?\nWhen did work on the Trump tower Moscow project officially cease? And why did it come to an end?\nHow aware were Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump of this venture? Did you brief them on the project?\nDid you know that IC Expert, the Russian company in this deal, was owned by three offshore companies, with one controlled by a Cypriot lawyer deeply involved in Russian finance? Do you know who ultimately controlled IC Expert?\nOne of the now-famous memos written by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele alleged that the Russians attempted to cultivate and co-opt Trump by dangling business opportunities in front of him. Do you think that is true?\nSaudi Arabia/United Arab Emirates\nHow much business has the Trump Organization done with Saudi Arabian entities?\nHas Trump conducted (or tried to conduct) any business with the Saudi royal family?\nWho was Trump\u2019s partner on the Trump Organization plan to open a hotel in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia?\nDoes Trump or his family own or control any property in Dubai or elsewhere in the United Arab Emirates?\nChina\nCan you describe what you know, if anything, about the 2017 deal in which a woman with apparent ties to Chinese military intelligence bought a $16 million condo in New York City from Trump\u2019s company? Was Trump aware of this transaction?\nWere you aware of Trump Organization efforts to do business in China? What happened with these attempts?\nDeutsche Bank\nTrump has borrowed at least $364 million from Deutsche Bank. Can you explain his relationship with this bank?\nHow much money has he borrowed from this institution?\nThe funds for these loans come from the private side of the German bank\u2014that is, a division of the bank that caters to high-net-worth clients, for instance, by offering them riskier loans than the bank would usually allow. Do you know the ultimate source of the money? Is there any connection between these borrowed funds and Russian or other foreign interests?\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump asked Deutsche Bank for a new loan and was rejected. Did he approach any other banks for money?\nDoes Trump have any other major loans from overseas banks and sources? Has he ever?\nTrump SoHo\nDonald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump were accused of misleading prospective buyers about sales in the Trump SoHo hotel and condominium project. Do you know if they did provide false information to possible buyers?\nThe Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., dropped the case. Was this move related to campaign donations received by the DA?\nOne lawsuit claimed Trump SoHo was developed with the undisclosed help of convicted felons and was financed by shady sources in Kazakhstan and Russia. Is this true?\nDo you know of any examples of improper financing of that project or if any financing for it came from sources related to Russia or organized crime?\nDo you know of any examples when Trump, his relatives, the Trump Organization, or the firm\u2019s associates sought financing from questionable sources or sources linked to corrupt foreign officials or criminal activity?\nUkraine Peace Plans and Russian Sanctions\nBefore or after the election, did you ever talk with Trump about lifting the economic sanctions imposed on Russia? Was this ever part of any quid pro quo?\nWas the so-called Ukrainian peace plan you shared with then national security adviser Michael Flynn in the early days of the Trump administration related to the plan Paul Manafort reportedly discussed with Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime Manafort business associate?\nDid you receive any business rewards or other gains for passing along this Ukraine plan?\nWere you or Trump aware of Manafort\u2019s relationship with Oleg Deripaska and Manafort\u2019s interactions with Kilimnik, an alleged Russian intelligence associate, during the campaign?\nThe Post-election Swamp\nAfter Trump\u2019s election, you set up a lobbying and consulting business. Was Trump aware of your activities? Did he help you secure any of the lucrative contracts you obtained? Did you have or discuss with him any financial agreement under which he would receive a portion of your earnings? Did he offer to repay any debts to you by helping you secure business?\nWas Trump aware of your work with Columbus Nova, an American firm linked to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg? Did you ever introduce Vekselberg to Trump or convey to Trump any message from him?\nDid you discuss with Trump the effort of Franklin Haney, a Republican donor, to secure funding for a nuclear power plant project from the Qatar Investment Authority? Did Trump help you secure a contract with Haney to help Haney seek Qatari funding?\nFinally\nWhere are the bodies buried?",

Twitter said he had violated several of the company&rsquo;s rules, including creating and operating fake accounts that he used to spread misinformation and shape conversations about the 2020 elections.</p>\n<p>A Twitter spokesperson did not specify the accounts in question, but did note that they were linked to Wohl&rsquo;s own account. The spokesperson also noted that Wohl&rsquo;s comments expressing intentions to create fake accounts, made in a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/02/26/jacob-wohl-spread-twitter-lies-mueller-rbg-2020-election/2917226002/\"><em>USA Today</em> article published</a> earlier Tuesday, had prompted the company to review accounts related to Wohl&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>Wohl told the newspaper that he planned to create &ldquo;enormous left-wing online properties,&rdquo; make Facebook and Twitter accounts for them, and then &ldquo;use those to steer the left-wing votes in the primaries to what we feel are weaker candidates compared with Trump.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>According to Twitter, the company found that Wohl had already created fake accounts and tried to use them to spread misinformation about the 2020 election.</p>\n<p>While Wohl has not responded to a request for comment about Twitter&rsquo;s suspension of his accounts, in an interview with <em>Mother Jones</em> that took place before the company&rsquo;s actions on Tuesday, he both downplayed and defended his plans for 2020 as captured in <em>USA Today</em>&lsquo;s story.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a little bit out of context with the quote,&rdquo; Wohl said of the article. &ldquo;Basically for the 2020 cycle, I just want to be in the left-wing editorial business as well. And part of that&rsquo;s going to be online properties, and I&rsquo;m going to use those properties to influence the outcomes of US politics.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Wohl said he didn&rsquo;t believe it would violate Twitter&rsquo;s rules to create accounts espousing leftist perspectives and disagreed that such an effort would be deceptive even though he isn&rsquo;t a leftist. &ldquo;I think maybe &lsquo;disingenuous&rsquo; would be a better word,&rdquo; Wohl said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with me running left-wing properties,&rdquo; he said, citing what he identifies as his First Amendment right to do so. Wohl said the &ldquo;mechanics of&rdquo; such a venture were &ldquo;still taking shape,&rdquo; but suggested a potential business model could include &ldquo;investing in talented leftists who will do my bidding and run blogs.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I would never, ever violate the terms of service of anything that I use, whether it be Twitter or my utility company,&rdquo; Wohl told <em>Mother Jones</em>.</p>",

                "text": "Right-wing Twitter provocateur Jacob Wohl was suspended from the social-media platform on Tuesday after he boasted about plans to manipulate online political discussion in a high-profile newspaper interview. Twitter said he had violated several of the company\u2019s rules, including creating and operating fake accounts that he used to spread misinformation and shape conversations about the 2020 elections.\nA Twitter spokesperson did not specify the accounts in question, but did note that they were linked to Wohl\u2019s own account. The spokesperson also noted that Wohl\u2019s comments expressing intentions to create fake accounts, made in a USA Today article published earlier Tuesday, had prompted the company to review accounts related to Wohl\u2019s.\nWohl told the newspaper that he planned to create \u201cenormous left-wing online properties,\u201d make Facebook and Twitter accounts for them, and then \u201cuse those to steer the left-wing votes in the primaries to what we feel are weaker candidates compared with Trump.\u201d\nAccording to Twitter, the company found that Wohl had already created fake accounts and tried to use them to spread misinformation about the 2020 election.\nWhile Wohl has not responded to a request for comment about Twitter\u2019s suspension of his accounts, in an interview with Mother Jones that took place before the company\u2019s actions on Tuesday, he both downplayed and defended his plans for 2020 as captured in USA Today\u2018s story.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a little bit out of context with the quote,\u201d Wohl said of the article. \u201cBasically for the 2020 cycle, I just want to be in the left-wing editorial business as well. And part of that\u2019s going to be online properties, and I\u2019m going to use those properties to influence the outcomes of US politics.\u201d\nWohl said he didn\u2019t believe it would violate Twitter\u2019s rules to create accounts espousing leftist perspectives and disagreed that such an effort would be deceptive even though he isn\u2019t a leftist. \u201cI think maybe \u2018disingenuous\u2019 would be a better word,\u201d Wohl said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me running left-wing properties,\u201d he said, citing what he identifies as his First Amendment right to do so. Wohl said the \u201cmechanics of\u201d such a venture were \u201cstill taking shape,\u201d but suggested a potential business model could include \u201cinvesting in talented leftists who will do my bidding and run blogs.\u201d\n\u201cI would never, ever violate the terms of service of anything that I use, whether it be Twitter or my utility company,\u201d Wohl told Mother Jones.",

Instead, he has publicly endorsed little-known Union County Commissioner Stony Rushing, who has made some controversial remarks about Confederate symbols in the past.</p>\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/12/republicans-finally-have-a-voter-fraud-scandal-and-none-of-them-want-to-talk-about-it/\">election fraud</a> probe, Rushing publicly supported Harris, calling the North Carolina Election Board&rsquo;s investigation a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stony.rushing/posts/10213206740631938\">political coup</a>&rdquo; in a Facebook post and claiming, via meme, that Democratic candidate Dan McCready threw &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10213551817298639&set=a.1115325692194&type=3&theater\">ALL of Our Ballots In The Trash</a>!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After Harris led the race in NC-09 by 905 votes out of more than 280,000 cast, the state election board refused to certify the results in the wake of allegations that one of Harris&rsquo; political consultants tampered with absentee ballots in Bladen County.

Rushing, who was vice commissioner at the time, is quoted in the story proposing that the county make the courthouse into a museum in order to allow the Confederate flag to fly there.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a problem with the flag or our history,&rdquo; he told the paper.</p>\n<p>He also criticized the debate surrounding Confederate symbols as a distraction from the way the city of Charleston came together in the wake of the massacre.</p>\n<p>Rushing, who owns a <a href=\"https://takeaimtrainingrange.wildapricot.org/\">firing range</a> on the North Carolina border, is a proud member of the National Rifle Association and a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Take-Aim-Training-Show--New-shooting-range-to-serve-Union-and-surrounding-counties.html?soid=1103767661916&aid=juKwS2YALOg\">Top Ten Recruit of 2009 &amp; 2010</a>,&rdquo; according to a newsletter from the range, which was regularly sent out between 2011 and <a href=\"https://app.robly.com/archive?id=52ea2ab36fd98c2a3b959ab18de609cd&v=true\">November 2018</a> to promote his business, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/takeaimtraining?lang=en\">Take Aim Training</a>.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"> <p>This is the guy Mark Harris just endorsed to be the Republican nominee in North Carolina's 9th district <a href=\"https://t.co/qc9bw8aRGt\">pic.twitter.com/qc9bw8aRGt</a></p> <p>&mdash; Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1100481952342294528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 26, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2012, the newsletter <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190226200943/https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Take-Aim-Training-Show--Zombie-in-Florida-.html?soid=1103767661916&aid=F_8uGx250Sg\">joked</a> about the death of a black man in Florida named Rudy Eugene, who was killed by a police officer while high on bath salts and was dubbed &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/special-reports/causeway-attack/article1941239.html\">the Miami zombie</a>&rdquo; in certain corners of the internet.

Instead, he has publicly endorsed little-known Union County Commissioner Stony Rushing, who has made some controversial remarks about Confederate symbols in the past.\nDuring the election fraud probe, Rushing publicly supported Harris, calling the North Carolina Election Board\u2019s investigation a \u201cpolitical coup\u201d in a Facebook post and claiming, via meme, that Democratic candidate Dan McCready threw \u201cALL of Our Ballots In The Trash!\u201d\nAfter Harris led the race in NC-09 by 905 votes out of more than 280,000 cast, the state election board refused to certify the results in the wake of allegations that one of Harris\u2019 political consultants tampered with absentee ballots in Bladen County. Last week, the board voted unanimously to throw out the November results and hold a new contest for the open seat.\nOn his way out, @MarkHarrisNC9 endorsed Union County commissioner @StonyRushing.\nRushing suggested on Facebook that the #NC09 investigation was \"a political coup by the State Board and the Democrat leaders on that board.\"\nThe board's Republicans voted for a new election. #ncpol pic.twitter.com/BDbcdHIik0\n\u2014 Andy Specht (@AndySpecht) February 26, 2019\nRushing is a political unknown; his position as Union County commissioner is the highest-ranking office he has held. But he made news locally in 2015 when he defended Confederate symbols barely a week after nine congregants were murdered in their church by a 21-year-old white supremacist.\nAccording to the Charlotte Observer, small Confederate flags appeared at the base of a monument at the Old County Courthouse as outrage over Confederate symbolism in the South mounted once more in the days after the shooting; the flags were soon removed by county officials. Rushing, who was vice commissioner at the time, is quoted in the story proposing that the county make the courthouse into a museum in order to allow the Confederate flag to fly there.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with the flag or our history,\u201d he told the paper.\nHe also criticized the debate surrounding Confederate symbols as a distraction from the way the city of Charleston came together in the wake of the massacre.\nRushing, who owns a firing range on the North Carolina border, is a proud member of the National Rifle Association and a \u201cTop Ten Recruit of 2009 & 2010,\u201d according to a newsletter from the range, which was regularly sent out between 2011 and November 2018 to promote his business, Take Aim Training.\nThis is the guy Mark Harris just endorsed to be the Republican nominee in North Carolina's 9th district pic.twitter.com/qc9bw8aRGt\n\u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) February 26, 2019\nIn 2012, the newsletter joked about the death of a black man in Florida named Rudy Eugene, who was killed by a police officer while high on bath salts and was dubbed \u201cthe Miami zombie\u201d in certain corners of the internet. Photoshopped images of Al Sharpton and Barack Obama as zombies appear in the newsletter above a fake quote that echoes Obama\u2019s famous statement that if he had a son, that child would look like Trayvon Martin: \u201cIf I had a flesh eating zombie son he would look like Rudy.\u201d",

House Democrats <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/us/politics/national-emergency-pelosi.html\">have already introduced a bill</a> to reverse his declaration, and a lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/us/politics/national-emergency-lawsuits-trump.html\">filed by 16 states has challenged</a> Trump&rsquo;s constitutional authority to fund the wall. Then there&rsquo;s the question of whether Trump can even successfully divert the funds he identified in the first place.</p>\n<p>The White House is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-border-wall-emergency-funds.html\">planning to steer</a> $3.6 billion from unused military construction projects, $600 million from the Treasury Department&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-02-15/trump-taps-civil-asset-forfeiture-to-fund-border-wall\">asset forfeiture unit</a>, and $2.5 billion from a Pentagon <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-border-wall-emergency-funds.html\">counter-drug program</a> toward the wall&rsquo;s construction. Those plans hit a roadblock last week when <em>Roll Call </em>reported that less than 1 percent of the money Trump intends to take from the counter-narcotics program <a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/congress-block-big-chunk-trumps-emergency-wall-money\">is still available</a>. (A House Democratic staffer confirmed to <em>Mother Jones </em>that roughly $80 million remains in this designated fund. A Defense Department spokesperson said &ldquo;no decisions have been made yet&rdquo; about replacing the missing cash.)</p>\n<p>To make up the difference, the House Democratic source said the Pentagon is expected to draw upon its military construction budget. This pool of funds, which includes money for base repairs and the housing of military families, among <a href=\"https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/documents/defbudget/FY2019/FY2019_c1.pdf\">other line items</a>, is a convenient choice because most construction projects are funded through multiyear appropriations&mdash;as opposed to the drug prevention funding, which expires this fall at the end of the fiscal year.</p>\n<p>Delaying billions of construction projects could invite its own host of problems. For one thing, these projects include the <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/those-porky-pentagon-earmarks-never-really-went-away/\">textbook, job-creating pork-barrel spending</a> that lawmakers use to reward the folks back home in their districts. &ldquo;There is probably no part of the defense budget that is more directly and concretely linked to the interests of a member of Congress than the MILCON [military construction] budget,&rdquo; says Gordon Adams, who oversaw national security and foreign policy budgets in the Clinton White House and is now a fellow at the nonpartisan Stimson Center. &ldquo;These are specific projects in specific districts.&rdquo; Lawmakers who championed these projects will almost certainly not be inclined to give them up easily. Once senior Pentagon officials sort out which projects will and will not be prioritized, the politically unwelcome task of defending those choices will fall to Pat Shanahan, the acting defense secretary.</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;There is probably no part of the defense budget that is more directly and concretely linked to the interests of a member of Congress than the MILCON budget.&rdquo;</aside>\n<p>Even though he&rsquo;s the likely favorite to replace retired general Jim Mattis in a permanent capacity, Shanahan is not exactly beloved by Trump&rsquo;s top Republican allies on Capitol Hill. Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), who chairs the powerful Senate Armed Services panel, bluntly said earlier this month that Shanahan lacks humility, while Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump adviser, lashed out at him <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/20/inside-patrick-shanahans-clash-with-congress-munich-over-syria/?utm_term=.686e28c12ee1\">during a meeting last week in Munich</a>. Josh Rogin of the <em>Washington Post </em>reported that Graham mocked Shanahan&rsquo;s plan to withdraw all US troops from Syria by the end of April, calling it the &ldquo;dumbest f&mdash;ing idea I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&rdquo; If Shanahan followed through on that order, Graham reportedly told him, &ldquo;I am now your adversary, not your friend.&rdquo; (Trump recently agreed to keep <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/world/middleeast/trump-troops-syria-.html\">about 20 percent</a> of the original contingent there.)</p>\n<p>Shanahan will need all the Republican support he can get, because Democrats have already begun to turn on him. Even after dozens of Democratic senators <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00162\">voted for his confirmation</a> as deputy secretary, Shanahan has clashed repeatedly in recent weeks with their counterparts in the House. Climate change has emerged as a particularly fraught point of division between the Pentagon and Capitol Hill. Weeks after taking over, Shanahan <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/01/the-pentagons-new-climate-change-report-is-missing-some-important-details/\">was scolded</a> by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) for submitting a climate report that was &ldquo;half-baked&rdquo; and &ldquo;inadequate.&rdquo; Lawmakers will certainly be watching to see whether any military construction funds related to climate resilience <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060121555\">will be affected</a> by Trump&rsquo;s emergency declaration. These projects tend not to be explicitly about climate change but targeted in a way that addresses its impacts&mdash;for example, sprucing up a base that is vulnerable to flooding. Among the military&rsquo;s top priorities will be to protect projects connected to &ldquo;health and safety and new missions,&rdquo; says Mark Cancian, a former Pentagon official with experience in the Office of Management and Budget.</p>\n<p>Should they follow through on this, programs with an environmental focus will be vulnerable to delays or cuts. At the same time as Trump is planning to dip into the military construction budget, top military officials <a href=\"https://news.usni.org/2019/02/17/neller-marines-need-3-5-billion-camp-lejeune-repairs-despite-milcon-cuts-border-spending\">are calling on Congress</a> to allocate even more money after a brutal hurricane season&mdash;and not for a border wall. Camp Lejeune, the largest Marine Corps base on the East Coast, requires more than $3 billion in repairs beyond what Congress appropriated after Hurricane Florence devastated the North Carolina installation. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have money for that,&rdquo; Marine Corps commandant General Robert Neller <a href=\"https://news.usni.org/2019/02/17/neller-marines-need-3-5-billion-camp-lejeune-repairs-despite-milcon-cuts-border-spending\">said at a recent conference</a> hosted by the US Naval Institute. &ldquo;If we have to pay that ourselves, it&rsquo;ll take the MILCON budget of the Marine Corps for probably the next four years.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The ugly politics aside, Trump and Shanahan still have a practical problem. To reprogram funds from one division of DOD, like military construction, to another pot requires direct approval from senior lawmakers of both parties. Traditionally, the leadership of the four committees that oversee defense appropriations need to sign off on a reprogramming request, which will almost certainly be required if Trump hopes to make up for the counter-drug funds that have already been obligated. Given Democrats&rsquo; opposition to Trump&rsquo;s emergency declaration, that request would almost certainly be refused. Trump could do an end run around Congress and scrounge up funds from other dusty corners of the Pentagon&rsquo;s budget, but he&rsquo;ll still need to reckon with the unsavory prospect of depriving some Republican allies of signature projects in their districts.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The politics of this are much more lethal than one thinks,&rdquo; Adams says.</p>",

                "text": "By his own admission, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border to turbocharge the construction of a border wall that Congress refused to fund. \u201cI could do the wall over a longer period of time,\u201d he told reporters earlier this month. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to do this, but I\u2019d rather do it much faster.\u201d\nBut in the rush to build his \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d wall, Trump may have actually invited more backlash and oversight from Congress and the states. House Democrats have already introduced a bill to reverse his declaration, and a lawsuit filed by 16 states has challenged Trump\u2019s constitutional authority to fund the wall. Then there\u2019s the question of whether Trump can even successfully divert the funds he identified in the first place.\nThe White House is reportedly planning to steer $3.6 billion from unused military construction projects, $600 million from the Treasury Department\u2019s asset forfeiture unit, and $2.5 billion from a Pentagon counter-drug program toward the wall\u2019s construction. Those plans hit a roadblock last week when Roll Call reported that less than 1 percent of the money Trump intends to take from the counter-narcotics program is still available. (A House Democratic staffer confirmed to Mother Jones that roughly $80 million remains in this designated fund. A Defense Department spokesperson said \u201cno decisions have been made yet\u201d about replacing the missing cash.)\nTo make up the difference, the House Democratic source said the Pentagon is expected to draw upon its military construction budget. This pool of funds, which includes money for base repairs and the housing of military families, among other line items, is a convenient choice because most construction projects are funded through multiyear appropriations\u2014as opposed to the drug prevention funding, which expires this fall at the end of the fiscal year.\nDelaying billions of construction projects could invite its own host of problems. For one thing, these projects include the textbook, job-creating pork-barrel spending that lawmakers use to reward the folks back home in their districts. \u201cThere is probably no part of the defense budget that is more directly and concretely linked to the interests of a member of Congress than the MILCON [military construction] budget,\u201d says Gordon Adams, who oversaw national security and foreign policy budgets in the Clinton White House and is now a fellow at the nonpartisan Stimson Center. \u201cThese are specific projects in specific districts.\u201d Lawmakers who championed these projects will almost certainly not be inclined to give them up easily. Once senior Pentagon officials sort out which projects will and will not be prioritized, the politically unwelcome task of defending those choices will fall to Pat Shanahan, the acting defense secretary.\n\u201cThere is probably no part of the defense budget that is more directly and concretely linked to the interests of a member of Congress than the MILCON budget.\u201d\nEven though he\u2019s the likely favorite to replace retired general Jim Mattis in a permanent capacity, Shanahan is not exactly beloved by Trump\u2019s top Republican allies on Capitol Hill. Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), who chairs the powerful Senate Armed Services panel, bluntly said earlier this month that Shanahan lacks humility, while Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump adviser, lashed out at him during a meeting last week in Munich. Josh Rogin of the Washington Post reported that Graham mocked Shanahan\u2019s plan to withdraw all US troops from Syria by the end of April, calling it the \u201cdumbest f\u2014ing idea I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d If Shanahan followed through on that order, Graham reportedly told him, \u201cI am now your adversary, not your friend.\u201d (Trump recently agreed to keep about 20 percent of the original contingent there.)\nShanahan will need all the Republican support he can get, because Democrats have already begun to turn on him. Even after dozens of Democratic senators voted for his confirmation as deputy secretary, Shanahan has clashed repeatedly in recent weeks with their counterparts in the House. Climate change has emerged as a particularly fraught point of division between the Pentagon and Capitol Hill. Weeks after taking over, Shanahan was scolded by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) for submitting a climate report that was \u201chalf-baked\u201d and \u201cinadequate.\u201d Lawmakers will certainly be watching to see whether any military construction funds related to climate resilience will be affected by Trump\u2019s emergency declaration. These projects tend not to be explicitly about climate change but targeted in a way that addresses its impacts\u2014for example, sprucing up a base that is vulnerable to flooding. Among the military\u2019s top priorities will be to protect projects connected to \u201chealth and safety and new missions,\u201d says Mark Cancian, a former Pentagon official with experience in the Office of Management and Budget.\nShould they follow through on this, programs with an environmental focus will be vulnerable to delays or cuts. At the same time as Trump is planning to dip into the military construction budget, top military officials are calling on Congress to allocate even more money after a brutal hurricane season\u2014and not for a border wall. Camp Lejeune, the largest Marine Corps base on the East Coast, requires more than $3 billion in repairs beyond what Congress appropriated after Hurricane Florence devastated the North Carolina installation. \u201cWe don\u2019t have money for that,\u201d Marine Corps commandant General Robert Neller said at a recent conference hosted by the US Naval Institute. \u201cIf we have to pay that ourselves, it\u2019ll take the MILCON budget of the Marine Corps for probably the next four years.\u201d\nThe ugly politics aside, Trump and Shanahan still have a practical problem. To reprogram funds from one division of DOD, like military construction, to another pot requires direct approval from senior lawmakers of both parties. Traditionally, the leadership of the four committees that oversee defense appropriations need to sign off on a reprogramming request, which will almost certainly be required if Trump hopes to make up for the counter-drug funds that have already been obligated. Given Democrats\u2019 opposition to Trump\u2019s emergency declaration, that request would almost certainly be refused. Trump could do an end run around Congress and scrounge up funds from other dusty corners of the Pentagon\u2019s budget, but he\u2019ll still need to reckon with the unsavory prospect of depriving some Republican allies of signature projects in their districts.\n\u201cThe politics of this are much more lethal than one thinks,\u201d Adams says.",

Never before had a sitting US president met face-to-face with the leader of North Korea, a country that once <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-korea-claims-it-could-wipe-out-manhattan-with-a-hydrogen-bomb/2016/03/13/3834cd54-e919-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html?utm_term=.0f5fcb16caea\">threatened to burn Manhattan</a> &ldquo;down to ashes&rdquo; with a hydrogen bomb. The event was perfect for a president who <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/08/18/trump-albany-rally-winning-sot.cnn\">loves to reduce</a> even the thorniest political issues down to &ldquo;winning&rdquo; or &ldquo;losing.&rdquo; By meeting Kim, Trump could claim an achievement that had eluded all of his predecessors, free from the pressure of a perfect first summit. As Tod Lindberg, a fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, put it, &ldquo;You only get one first date.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>During this next go-around in Vietnam, Trump and his negotiating team face a more daunting task: extracting some specific concessions from an isolated regime with virtually no track record of cooperating with the West. Perhaps anticipating this difficulty, Trump has tried to dramatically reduce the expectations for this encore meeting.</p>\n<p>After proclaiming the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1006837823469735936?lang=en\">end of North Korea as a nuclear threat</a> after last year&rsquo;s Singapore summit, Trump recently said he is in &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/no-rush-trump-redefines-success-ahead-of-second-summit-with-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un/2019/02/23/ca8bb810-36b0-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html?utm_term=.1065d2bf4014\">no rush</a>&rdquo; for Kim to give up his nuclear weapons. &ldquo;I have no pressing timetable,&rdquo; he said. A senior administration official, who spoke with reporters in a conference call last week on the condition of anonymity, was similarly vague: &ldquo;We believe there&rsquo;s a possibility that North Korea can make a choice to fully denuclearize.&rdquo; So far, Kim&rsquo;s actions belie that possibility. Despite <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/joint-statement-president-donald-j-trump-united-states-america-chairman-kim-jong-un-democratic-peoples-republic-korea-singapore-summit/\">pledging</a> to &ldquo;work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula&rdquo; in Singapore, North Korea has spent the last several months <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korea-keeping-up-work-on-missile-sites-report-says-1542039838\">producing more ballistic missiles</a> and improving its <a href=\"https://www.38north.org/2018/06/yongbyon062618/?mod=article_inline\">signature nuclear research facility</a>.</p>\n<p>This lack of progress poses a vexing problem for Trump, whose current diplomatic approach bears little resemblance to the &ldquo;maximum pressure&rdquo; he placed on Kim two years ago. &ldquo;No regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea,&rdquo; he said during his <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trumps-state-union-address/\">first State of the Union address</a> last year. Melania Trump&rsquo;s guests for that speech <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/trump-north-korea-summit-vietnam-human-rights-1185308?nname=playbook&nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&nrid=00000156-a3cf-d3ed-ad5f-f3ef07940001&nlid=630318\">included</a> North Korean defector Ji Seong-ho and the parents of Otto Warmbier, the college student who was imprisoned in North Korea for more than a year. The treatment of Warmbier, who died upon returning to the United States in June 2017 with severe brain damage, became a cornerstone of Trump&rsquo;s public campaign against Kim. &ldquo;Otto was tortured beyond belief by North Korea,&rdquo; Trump said at the time <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/912636538156146688\">on Twitter</a>. The two leaders embarked on a war of words that autumn. After Trump mockingly called his North Korean counterpart &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/world/trump-un-north-korea-iran.html?module=inline\">Rocket Man</a>&rdquo; in a speech at the United Nations and threatened to &ldquo;totally destroy&rdquo; his regime, Kim <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/world/asia/trump-north-korea-dotard.html\">slimed Trump</a> as a &ldquo;mentally deranged U.S. dotard.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ever since their meeting in Singapore, though, Trump has had nothing but nice things to say about his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/948355557022420992?lang=en\">onetime sparring partner</a>.

                "text": "The first summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un last June was historic. Never before had a sitting US president met face-to-face with the leader of North Korea, a country that once threatened to burn Manhattan \u201cdown to ashes\u201d with a hydrogen bomb. The event was perfect for a president who loves to reduce even the thorniest political issues down to \u201cwinning\u201d or \u201closing.\u201d By meeting Kim, Trump could claim an achievement that had eluded all of his predecessors, free from the pressure of a perfect first summit. As Tod Lindberg, a fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, put it, \u201cYou only get one first date.\u201d\nDuring this next go-around in Vietnam, Trump and his negotiating team face a more daunting task: extracting some specific concessions from an isolated regime with virtually no track record of cooperating with the West. Perhaps anticipating this difficulty, Trump has tried to dramatically reduce the expectations for this encore meeting.\nAfter proclaiming the end of North Korea as a nuclear threat after last year\u2019s Singapore summit, Trump recently said he is in \u201cno rush\u201d for Kim to give up his nuclear weapons. \u201cI have no pressing timetable,\u201d he said. A senior administration official, who spoke with reporters in a conference call last week on the condition of anonymity, was similarly vague: \u201cWe believe there\u2019s a possibility that North Korea can make a choice to fully denuclearize.\u201d So far, Kim\u2019s actions belie that possibility. Despite pledging to \u201cwork toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\u201d in Singapore, North Korea has spent the last several months producing more ballistic missiles and improving its signature nuclear research facility.\nThis lack of progress poses a vexing problem for Trump, whose current diplomatic approach bears little resemblance to the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d he placed on Kim two years ago. \u201cNo regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea,\u201d he said during his first State of the Union address last year. Melania Trump\u2019s guests for that speech included North Korean defector Ji Seong-ho and the parents of Otto Warmbier, the college student who was imprisoned in North Korea for more than a year. The treatment of Warmbier, who died upon returning to the United States in June 2017 with severe brain damage, became a cornerstone of Trump\u2019s public campaign against Kim. \u201cOtto was tortured beyond belief by North Korea,\u201d Trump said at the time on Twitter. The two leaders embarked on a war of words that autumn. After Trump mockingly called his North Korean counterpart \u201cRocket Man\u201d in a speech at the United Nations and threatened to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d his regime, Kim slimed Trump as a \u201cmentally deranged U.S. dotard.\u201d\nEver since their meeting in Singapore, though, Trump has had nothing but nice things to say about his onetime sparring partner. Kim \u201cloves his people,\u201d Trump claimed, even as the UN has accused the thirtysomething dictator of \u201csystematic, widespread and gross human rights violations.\u201d The United States has a long bipartisan tradition of allying itself with authoritarian leaders under the right circumstance, but Trump\u2019s about-face on Kim was stark both for its suddenness and how little Trump seemed to be getting in return for his flattery.\nNorth Korea has not conducted a missile test in more than a year, but even Trump\u2019s own intelligence advisers have rejected the claim that Kim is moving toward denuclearization. This difference of opinion became obvious when Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats submitted the annual worldwide threat assessment to Congress last month. \u201cNorth Korea retains its WMD capabilities, and the [intelligence community] continues to assess that it is unlikely to give up all of its WMD stockpiles, delivery systems, and production capabilities,\u201d the report states.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, a former human rights lawyer, has also barely mentioned Kim\u2019s horrific human rights record as dialogue has picked up between the North and South. But Moon has not lionized Kim to the same degree as Trump, who famously said last fall on the campaign trail that he and the North Korean dictator \u201cfell in love.\u201d These kind of statements, even if directed toward some strategic purpose, are unnerving to most seasoned watchers of Pyongyang-Washington relations. \u201cI\u2019m appalled by some of the ways the language has been used,\u201d says Kathleen Stephens, the former US ambassador to South Korea who now leads the Korea Economic Institute of America. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to building the relationship.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m appalled by some of the ways the language has been used. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to building the relationship.\u201d\nSupporters of Trump\u2019s approach believe it is pragmatic to focus on denuclearization at the expense of human rights. During a speech last month at Stanford University, Stephen Biegun, Trump\u2019s envoy to North Korea, identified the administration\u2019s top priority as \u201cthe final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea.\u201d That strategy has won over converts like Lindberg, who praised Biegun\u2019s approach in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed (which the White House promptly blasted out in an email to reporters). \u201cThe North Korean government is truly monstrous,\u201d Lindberg wrote, \u201cbut the most dangerous problem it poses comes from its nuclear-weapons programs, and US diplomacy must concentrate there.\u201d\nDenuclearization makes for an aggressive goal, but North Korea could deny Trump an apparent foreign policy victory by continuing to stonewall. Trump\u2019s frank admission that he is in \u201cno rush\u201d seems to anticipate this possibility, as has the inclusion of a whole host of other issues that American negotiators are reportedly planning to bring up in Vietnam. In addition to a request for North Korea to shut down production at its Yongbyon nuclear facility, Trump is expected to push for Kim to return more remains of American troops killed during the Korean War, Vox reported this week.

The repatriation of more US service members would be an achievement for Trump, but not exactly a novel one.

If the agreement Trump crafts with Kim in Vietnam is just a reprise of the statement both leaders signed in Singapore, it leaves open the question of whether these months of flattery have been for naught.\nAndrei Lankov, a North Korea expert who teaches at Kookmin University in Seoul, has one theory. In the run-up to a fierce reelection fight next year, Trump \u201chopes to win a Nobel Prize, and \u2018success\u2019 in dealing with North Korea could be seen as a very good justification for this award,\u201d Lankov wrote earlier this month for the independent media outlet NK News. Days after Lankov\u2019s article was published, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported that Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, had nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize at the US government\u2019s request. Trump offered his own explanation for the nomination at a White House press conference. \u201cHe had missiles flying over Japan. They had alarms going off,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, all of a sudden they feel good. They feel safe. I did that.\u201d\nWhile Trump cannot claim to have denuclearized the peninsula yet, he has undoubtedly created an opportunity for serious diplomacy with North Korea. The meeting will reveal if he will be able to extract the concessions needed to push the negotiations forward, or will just spin another stalemate as a victory.",

Penn suggested subtly drawing attention to Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;lack of American roots&rdquo; by, among other things, using &ldquo;our logo to make some flags we can give out&rdquo;:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong> <u>Lack of American Roots</u></strong></p> <p>All of these articles about his boyhood in Indonesia and his life in Hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse, multicultural and putting that in a new light.</p> <p>Save it for 2050.</p> <p>It also exposes a very strong weakness for him&mdash;his roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited.

Just two months earlier, in January 2007, <em>Insight </em>magazine&mdash;a publication affiliated with the conservative <em>Washington Times</em>&mdash;had <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070203060531/insightmag.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=5D3B38F8A2584DB5A77BA05660C6045C&nm=Free+Access&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&tier=4&id=B85E731B7602454BBFE7451111C6C4EC\">reported</a> that &ldquo;researchers connected to&rdquo; Clinton had discovered that as a child in Indonesia, Obama had attended a madrassa that may have indoctrinated him with radical Islam. The tale ricocheted across the internet and quickly found its way to Fox News. &ldquo;This is huge!&rdquo; <em>Fox &amp; Friends&rsquo; </em>Steve Doocy famously declared.</p>\n<p>The story was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/22/obama.madrassa/\">completely false</a>. The schools Obama attended in Indonesia were not madrassas. The Clinton campaign flatly denied having anything to do with the smear, telling CNN that it was &ldquo;an obvious right-wing hit job.&rdquo; No evidence to the contrary ever emerged. But <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2007/04/12/courics-notebook-rehashed-debunked-obama-rumors/138596\">rumors</a> about Obama&rsquo;s upbringing and religion persisted, eventually morphing into the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/donald-trump-birther/index.html\">birther conspiracy theories</a> that Trump himself would embrace.</p>\n<p>Twelve years later, as the most diverse group of candidates ever prepares to embark on another presidential campaign, Democrats look a whole lot more like the party of Barack Obama than the party of Mark Penn.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My views haven&rsquo;t changed at all,&rdquo; Penn <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/08/31/mark-penn-clinton-strategist-mueller-investigation-donald-trump-219622\">told <em>Politico</em></a> last year. &ldquo;The party&rsquo;s changed.&rdquo; Indeed.</p>",

Just two months earlier, in January 2007, Insight magazine\u2014a publication affiliated with the conservative Washington Times\u2014had reported that \u201cresearchers connected to\u201d Clinton had discovered that as a child in Indonesia, Obama had attended a madrassa that may have indoctrinated him with radical Islam. The tale ricocheted across the internet and quickly found its way to Fox News. \u201cThis is huge!\u201d Fox & Friends\u2019 Steve Doocy famously declared.\nThe story was completely false. The schools Obama attended in Indonesia were not madrassas. The Clinton campaign flatly denied having anything to do with the smear, telling CNN that it was \u201can obvious right-wing hit job.\u201d No evidence to the contrary ever emerged. But rumors about Obama\u2019s upbringing and religion persisted, eventually morphing into the birther conspiracy theories that Trump himself would embrace.\nTwelve years later, as the most diverse group of candidates ever prepares to embark on another presidential campaign, Democrats look a whole lot more like the party of Barack Obama than the party of Mark Penn.\n\u201cMy views haven\u2019t changed at all,\u201d Penn told Politico last year. \u201cThe party\u2019s changed.\u201d Indeed.",
