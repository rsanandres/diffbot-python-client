On the obstruction question, Barr said Mueller had declined to make a &quot;traditional prosecutorial judgment&quot; and deferred from drawing a conclusion, one way or another.</p>\n<p>But Barr, in consultation with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, concluded there was not enough evidence to charge Trump with an obstruction offense.

Those concerns stem in large part from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/william-barr-memo-mueller-investigation-legally-insupportable-2018-12/\">a controversial memo Barr sent</a> to the Justice Department and the White House last year, in which he argued that Mueller's obstruction probe was &quot;legally insupportable&quot; and should not be sanctioned by the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>Democrats contend that Barr's memo proves he is inherently biased against a key thread in Mueller's investigation, and therefore his &quot;principal conclusion&quot; that Trump did not obstruct justice is not an objective legal assessment.</p>\n<p>House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler, House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, and other Democrats are pushing hard for an un-redacted version of the report. Democrats argue that it is necessary for Congress to have all the information to properly perform its oversight functions.</p>\n<p>They also say Mueller's decision not to prosecute Trump does not necessarily mean he did not commit impeachable offenses.</p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/washington-waits-in-suspense-for-mueller-report-11555193798?utm_source=CNN+Media%3A+Reliable+Sources&utm_campaign=12ffacfe54-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_09_11_04_47_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_e95cdc16a9-12ffacfe54-100811713\">reported</a> that once they get a redacted version of the report, House Judiciary Committee lawyers and aides plan to comb through the document and determine whether there is a large gap between what they requested from the Justice Department and what the redacted copy of the report provides.</p>\n<p>Based on their findings, The Journal reported, the committee will decide whether to subpoena the department for a full version of the report, as well as its underlying evidence.</p>\n<h2>How are Republicans reacting to the report's upcoming release?</h2>\n<figure data-e2e-name=\"image-figure-image\" data-media-container=\"image\" data-type=\"img\"> <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ae330a019ee8640008b45d3?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp\"></img>  <figcaption data-e2e-name=\"image-caption\"> House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. </figcaption>  Thomson Reuters </figure>\n<p>Republicans are increasing calls for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/william-barr-doj-fbi-bias-misconduct-trump-report-2019-4\">an investigation into the roots</a> of the Russia investigation.</p>\n<p>Trump and his Republican allies in Congress, like House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, have long claimed that senior FBI and Justice Department officials acted on anti-Trump bias and launched the Russia probe to undermine his presidency.</p>\n<p>Republicans also falsely claim that the FBI illegally &quot;spied&quot; on the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. During a hearing before Congress last week, Barr told lawmakers he had put together a team to investigate whether any &quot;unauthorized surveillance&quot; of the campaign occurred, but he acknowledged there was no evidence to date suggesting it had.</p>\n<p>Still, Trump and his loyalists seized on Barr's remarks ahead of the report's release, saying it proved the origins of the Russia probe were corrupt.</p>\n<p>Last week, Nunes told Fox News' Sean Hannity he was privately pushing Barr to launch criminal investigations into at least eight former FBI and Justice Department officials involved in probing Trump's ties to Russia.</p>\n<p>He added that he plans to meet with Barr and discuss the criminal referrals &quot;when appropriate.&quot;</p>\n<p>Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham has also signaled an interest in investigating the DOJ's oversight of the Russia investigation.</p>\n<p>&quot;Once we put the Mueller report to bed, once Barr comes to the committee and takes questions about his findings and his actions, and we get to see the Mueller report, consistent with law, then we are going to turn to finding out how this got off the rails,&quot; Graham told Fox News last month.</p>\n<h2>How are Trump and his legal team reacting to the report's upcoming release?</h2>\n<figure data-e2e-name=\"image-figure-image\" data-media-container=\"image\" data-type=\"img\"> <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5c4816542bdd7f4d5825d6c2?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp\"></img>   (Photo by Anthony Devlin/Getty Images)  </figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-responds-to-muellers-report-russia-investigation-2019-3\">Trump celebrated</a> when Barr released his initial review of Mueller's findings, claiming that they represented a &quot;complete and total exoneration&quot; of him (even though Mueller's team specified in their report that their findings did not exonerate Trump).</p>\n<p>The president also supported releasing an un-redacted copy of the report at first. But his tune changed as Democrats began calling for the same, and Trump later said the report should not be released at all.</p>\n<p>Two people with knowledge of the matter told INSIDER on Thursday that Trump's legal team is not concerned about the redacted report being released because they don't believe it will shift public opinion against the president.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Rudy Giuliani, Trump's lead defense lawyer, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-robert-mueller-investigation-attacks-may-be-working-2018-5\">told INSIDER last year</a> that &quot;our jury is the American people.&quot; He added that if Trump and his allies sowed enough doubt about the legitimacy of the Russia investigation, the public would not trust Mueller's findings, regardless of how damaging they were, and Trump would not be impeached.</p>\n<h2>How is the Mueller team reacting to the report's upcoming release?</h2>\n<figure data-e2e-name=\"image-figure-image\" data-media-container=\"image\" data-type=\"img\"> <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5c965c607563b02a3e7f3b15?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp\"></img>   Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP  </figure>\n<p>Contrary to the Trump legal team's belief, some prosecutors on Mueller's team reportedly believe their findings are more dangerous to the president than Barr indicated in his initial review.</p>\n<p>People familiar with the matter <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/limited-information-barr-has-shared-about-russia-investigation-frustrated-some-on-muellers-team/2019/04/03/c98e8a02-567a-11e9-814f-e2f46684196e_story.html?utm_term=.0ecb3f574d64\">told The Washington Post</a> some on Mueller's team believed Barr's letter on the final report downplayed the fact that &quot;the evidence they gathered on obstruction was alarming and significant.&quot;</p>\n<p>Also, according to The New York Times, Mueller's investigators <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mueller-team-final-report-trump-barr-summary-2019-4\">wrote multiple summaries</a> of their report, and some of them believe Barr should have included more of their material in the initial four-page letter he sent to Congress laying out his principal conclusions.</p>\n<p>For the past two years, Mueller ran the tightest ship in Washington, DC.

                "text": "AP/Cliff Owen\nThe Justice Department will release a redacted version of the special counsel Robert Mueller's final report in the Russia probe on Thursday.\nFor the last two years, Mueller spearheaded a tight ship as he and his team of prosecutors conducted one of the most politically sensitive investigations in modern US history.\nWe've put together a running list of everything you need to know about the highly anticipated report ahead of its release, and how Washington's political factions are bracing for its impact.\nThe Justice Department announced will release a redacted version of the special counsel Robert Mueller's final report in the Russia investigation on Thursday at roughly 11:00 am ET.\nThe report's release will cap nearly two years of frenzied speculation about the most politically sensitive investigation in modern US history.\nHere's everything we know about the highly anticipated report so far:\nWhen will the Mueller report be delivered to Congress?\nAssociated Press\nCongress will get the report sometime between 11 a.m. ET and noon on Thursday. Before that, Attorney General William Barr will hold a press conference at 9:30 a.m. ET to brief reporters on an \"overview\" of the document and to answer questions about the redaction process and more.\nWhat was Mueller investigating?\nAnn Heisenfelt/Getty Images\nMueller was appointed special counsel in May 2017, after President Donald Trump fired then-FBI director James Comey. According to a memo by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein outlining the scope of Mueller's appointment, he was tasked with investigating the following:\n\"Any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.\"\n\"Any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\"\n\"Any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4(a).\" This federal statute authorizes the special counsel to investigate federal crimes \"committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere\" with the investigation, such as perjury and obstruction of justice.\nThroughout the course of the investigation, the public learned through media reports and legal disclosures by the special counsel's office that Mueller was investigating several threads, including: Trump's business ties to Russia; his campaign associates' links to Russia; the contacts and meetings between his advisers and those linked to the Russian government; Trump aides' involvement in foreign lobbying activities; Trump's decision to fire Comey and any other attempts to hamper the investigation; the Trump Organization's push to build a Trump Tower in Moscow; why several Trump associates lied to Congress, the FBI, or the public about their involvement in episodes being investigated; and more.\nWhat format will the report be in?\nReuters\nThe report will be delivered to Congress on a CD-ROM. It's unclear whether the document will be in an easily readable format \u2014 like a PDF document that allows you to search for keywords \u2014 or if it will be a paper copy scanned and uploaded.\nHow long is the report?\nAssociated Press\nBarr said the final report is nearly 400 pages.\nWhat do we know about it so far?\nReuters\nBroadly, the report will cover two lines of inquiry: did the Trump campaign conspire with the Russian government during the 2016 election? And did the president try to hamper the investigation after Comey confirmed its existence during a congressional hearing in March 2017?\nIn a letter to Congress last month, Barr said Mueller's team did not find sufficient evidence to bring a conspiracy charge against Trump or anyone associated with his campaign. On the obstruction question, Barr said Mueller had declined to make a \"traditional prosecutorial judgment\" and deferred from drawing a conclusion, one way or another.\nBut Barr, in consultation with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, concluded there was not enough evidence to charge Trump with an obstruction offense. Barr said current Justice Department policy saying that a sitting president cannot be indicted was not a factor in his decision.\nRead more: House Democrats authorize subpoena for the Mueller report, teeing up an unprecedented legal battle with the DOJ\nWhat new information could we learn?\nREUTERS/Lucas Jackson\nAllies of the president took a victory lap after Barr released his \"principal conclusions\" to Congress. But legal experts and national-security veterans say their celebration may be premature.\nSpecifically, they emphasized that the prosecutorial standard for proving conspiracy is higher than the counterintelligence standard used by agencies like the CIA.\nFor that reason, they believe Mueller's final report includes details that, while they may not rise to the level of criminal conduct, go far beyond those included in the cursory summary Barr sent to Congress.\nIntelligence veterans say the information Barr did not include from Mueller's report could go a long way in answering many of the lingering questions the public has about the myriad contacts, meetings, and interactions between Trump associates and those associated with the Russian government.\nRead more: House Democrats are preparing for a fierce fight with the Justice Department over some of the most sensitive parts of the Mueller report\nWhat will be redacted?\nAP Photo/Carolyn Kaster\nBarr stirred up some controversy on the Hill when he told Congress that he would be redacting certain categories of information from the final report. The categories that will be blocked out in the public report are:\nInformation that went before a grand jury but did not result in criminal charges\nInformation that could compromise intelligence sources and methods\nInformation that could pertain to other ongoing investigative matters\nInformation that would \"unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.\"\nLast week, Barr told Congress that he will include color-coded notes for each redaction that will explain why that piece of information was left out of the version of the report delivered to Congress and the public.\nIn March, Barr also revealed that nearly every page of the report contains at least some information that needs to be redacted.\nPrevious special prosecutors \u2014 like Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr and Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski \u2014 went to court to get a judge's permission to release as much information to Congress and the public as they could. But Barr said he will not do the same and will work according to current Justice Department policy and legal guidelines.\nHow are Democrats reacting to the report's upcoming release?\nGetty Images\nHouse and Senate Democrats have amped up calls for the attorney general to release to Congress a full, unredacted version of Mueller's report.\nDemocratic lawmakers were apoplectic about Barr's decision to hold a press conference over an hour before making the report available and said the move was designed to craft a narrative about the report that favors the president.\nThe attorney general appears to be waging a media campaign on behalf of President Trump,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a hastily arranged press conference Wednesday evening.\nDemocratic lawmakers expressed concerns about Barr's oversight of the Mueller probe from the start. Those concerns stem in large part from a controversial memo Barr sent to the Justice Department and the White House last year, in which he argued that Mueller's obstruction probe was \"legally insupportable\" and should not be sanctioned by the Justice Department.\nDemocrats contend that Barr's memo proves he is inherently biased against a key thread in Mueller's investigation, and therefore his \"principal conclusion\" that Trump did not obstruct justice is not an objective legal assessment.\nHouse Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler, House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, and other Democrats are pushing hard for an un-redacted version of the report. Democrats argue that it is necessary for Congress to have all the information to properly perform its oversight functions.\nThey also say Mueller's decision not to prosecute Trump does not necessarily mean he did not commit impeachable offenses.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that once they get a redacted version of the report, House Judiciary Committee lawyers and aides plan to comb through the document and determine whether there is a large gap between what they requested from the Justice Department and what the redacted copy of the report provides.\nBased on their findings, The Journal reported, the committee will decide whether to subpoena the department for a full version of the report, as well as its underlying evidence.\nHow are Republicans reacting to the report's upcoming release?\nThomson Reuters\nRepublicans are increasing calls for an investigation into the roots of the Russia investigation.\nTrump and his Republican allies in Congress, like House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, have long claimed that senior FBI and Justice Department officials acted on anti-Trump bias and launched the Russia probe to undermine his presidency.\nRepublicans also falsely claim that the FBI illegally \"spied\" on the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. During a hearing before Congress last week, Barr told lawmakers he had put together a team to investigate whether any \"unauthorized surveillance\" of the campaign occurred, but he acknowledged there was no evidence to date suggesting it had.\nStill, Trump and his loyalists seized on Barr's remarks ahead of the report's release, saying it proved the origins of the Russia probe were corrupt.\nLast week, Nunes told Fox News' Sean Hannity he was privately pushing Barr to launch criminal investigations into at least eight former FBI and Justice Department officials involved in probing Trump's ties to Russia.\nHe added that he plans to meet with Barr and discuss the criminal referrals \"when appropriate.\"\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham has also signaled an interest in investigating the DOJ's oversight of the Russia investigation.\n\"Once we put the Mueller report to bed, once Barr comes to the committee and takes questions about his findings and his actions, and we get to see the Mueller report, consistent with law, then we are going to turn to finding out how this got off the rails,\" Graham told Fox News last month.\nHow are Trump and his legal team reacting to the report's upcoming release?\n(Photo by Anthony Devlin/Getty Images)\nTrump celebrated when Barr released his initial review of Mueller's findings, claiming that they represented a \"complete and total exoneration\" of him (even though Mueller's team specified in their report that their findings did not exonerate Trump).\nThe president also supported releasing an un-redacted copy of the report at first. But his tune changed as Democrats began calling for the same, and Trump later said the report should not be released at all.\nTwo people with knowledge of the matter told INSIDER on Thursday that Trump's legal team is not concerned about the redacted report being released because they don't believe it will shift public opinion against the president.\nIndeed, Rudy Giuliani, Trump's lead defense lawyer, told INSIDER last year that \"our jury is the American people.\" He added that if Trump and his allies sowed enough doubt about the legitimacy of the Russia investigation, the public would not trust Mueller's findings, regardless of how damaging they were, and Trump would not be impeached.\nHow is the Mueller team reacting to the report's upcoming release?\nManuel Balce Ceneta/AP\nContrary to the Trump legal team's belief, some prosecutors on Mueller's team reportedly believe their findings are more dangerous to the president than Barr indicated in his initial review.\nPeople familiar with the matter told The Washington Post some on Mueller's team believed Barr's letter on the final report downplayed the fact that \"the evidence they gathered on obstruction was alarming and significant.\"\nAlso, according to The New York Times, Mueller's investigators wrote multiple summaries of their report, and some of them believe Barr should have included more of their material in the initial four-page letter he sent to Congress laying out his principal conclusions.\nFor the past two years, Mueller ran the tightest ship in Washington, DC. His office publicly broke its silence just twice during the investigation.\nOne former White House official who was previously involved in the Mueller investigation told INSIDER the public should take prosecutors' decision to express their frustration about Barr seriously, given what's at stake.\n\"If prosecutors are concerned that their conclusions may be obscured or misrepresented \u2014 and if they're worried enough that they're talking about it to other people \u2014 that's something everyone needs to take seriously, regardless of whose side you're on,\" the former official added.",

                "text": "Farah Abdi Warsameh/AP\nThe US government could be guilty of war crimes in Somalia after evidence of civilian casualties was uncovered in an investigation led by Amnesty International.\nThe investigation found that US airstrikes from both drones and manned aircraft killed at least 14 civilians and injured eight more people in just five of more than 100 strikes in the past two years.\n\"The public needs to understand that the US government really doesn't do a very good job of investigating who it's killed. We've seen this repeatedly now,\" an expert at Amnesty International told INSIDER.\n\"The attacks appear to have violated international humanitarian law, and some may amount to war crimes,\" the Amnesty International report said.\nThe US military could be guilty of war crimes in Somalia, according to a new report that challenges what the government has said about civilian casualties from its bombing campaign against al-Shabab \u2014 an al-Qaida affiliate \u2014 in the African nation.\nThe investigation, conducted by Amnesty International, found that US airstrikes from both drones and manned aircraft killed at least 14 civilians and injured eight more people in just five of more than 100 strikes in the past two years.\n\"The attacks appear to have violated international humanitarian law, and some may amount to war crimes,\" the Amnesty International report said.\nThe US Africa Command, or Africom, one of the Pentagon's 10 combatant command centers worldwide, \"repeated its denial that any civilians have been killed in its operations in Somalia\" when presented with Amnesty International's findings.\nRead more: Trump inherited Obama's drone war, and he's significantly expanded it in countries where the US is not technically at war\nAmnesty International conducted more than 150 interviews with \"eyewitnesses, relatives, persons displaced by the fighting, and expert sources,\" while \"rigorously\" analyzing \"satellite imagery, munition fragments, and photos from the aftermath of air strikes.\"\nAmnesty could not sufficiently corroborate reports of civilian casualties in each one of the dozens of strikes in Somalia that it examined, but it said in its report that the \"civilian death toll may well be much higher.\"\nThe Department of Defense and US government \"have not been honest about civilian casualties from its operations in Somalia,\" Daphne Eviatar, Amnesty International USA's director of security with human rights, told INSIDER.\nThe US has conducted dozens of strikes in Somalia under President Donald Trump, and it's not clear which were done under the Pentagon versus the CIA. Most drone strikes conducted by the Pentagon are required to be disclosed publicly, but the US intelligence community does not operate under the same rules.\n\"Africom has consistently said, despite dozens of airstrikes every year, that there have been zero civilian casualties\" in Somalia, Eviatar said, adding that this assertion is \"just not credible.\"\nAmnesty International was \"very suspicious\" of the military's consistent claims it wasn't killing any civilians in airstrikes, Eviatar said.\nRead more: Trump quietly rewrote the rules of drone warfare, which means the US can now kill civilians in secret\n\"We'd been getting some reports from the ground that this wasn't the case,\" she added. \"But we didn't know for sure until we went there and interviewed witnesses, looked at a ton of evidence, and realized that, in fact, there are children, farmers, and well-diggers being killed \u2014 people who are clearly not al-Shabab fighters.\"\nThe US government \"needs to acknowledge\" these civilian casualties, Eviatar said, adding that it looks like the military is engaging in what are known as \"signature strikes\" \u2014 strikes that target military-age males, even if the US isn't certain they have ties to militant or extremist groups. \"That's completely unlawful,\" Eviatar said, adding that criticism on this practice led President Barack Obama to establish new rules designed to protect civilians.\nRead more: US military says it killed roughly 60 'terrorists' in Somalia airstrike, the deadliest in a year\nTrump has rolled back Obama-era rules on covert drone strikes and has overseen a drastic increase in the number of strikes in Somalia, expanding the shadow wars that began under Obama. Under Trump, the US conducted more drone strikes in Somalia in 2017 alone than the total number conducted in the African nation during Obama's entire tenure.\nAmnesty's investigation comes on the heels of a decision from Trump to end an Obama-era rule for the US government to publicly report on civilian casualties from drone strikes. The reversal of that rule indicates there will be even less transparency on a program that was already virtually entirely out of the public eye.\nRead more: America's year in war: All the places US armed forces took or gave fire in 2018\n\"The public needs to understand that the US government really doesn't do a very good job of investigating who it's killed. We've seen this repeatedly now,\" Eviatar said. \"We saw it in Iraq, we saw it in Syria, and now we're seeing it in Somalia.\"\nResponding to Amnesty's report, a senior White House official on Wednesday told INSIDER: \"The United States Government is fully committed to complying with its obligations under the law of armed conflict; to minimizing, to the greatest extent possible, civilian causalities; and to taking appropriate action when civilian casualties unfortunately occur during military operations.\"\n\"In fact, the US government often imposes heightened policy standards that are more protective of civilians than the requirements of the law of armed conflict,\" the official added.\nExperts have pointed to civilian casualties from drone strikes as a catalyst and recruiting tool for terrorism, which underscores why this is an issue that strongly influences the public, even though it might have little knowledge about it because of the secrecy surrounding these strikes.\nIn 2010, a man named Faisal Shahzad attempted to bomb Times Square in New York City. Shahzad cited drone strikes as his inspiration.",

                "text": "AP Photo/Andrew Harnik\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday issued the second veto of his presidency on a war-powers resolution ending US support for the Saudi-led coalition in the Yemen conflict.\nThe resolution was in many ways a rebuke of Trump's response to the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nThe passage of this resolution also highlights growing anti-interventionist sentiments in Congress, particularly among Democrats.\nSen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna, who led the charge on the resolution, slammed Trump over his veto.\n\"This is very sad and a missed opportunity by the president to stand up for the Constitution,\" Khanna told INSIDER. \"He ignored the views of his allies like Rand Paul, Mark Meadows, and Matt Gaetz, all of whom voted against endless war and these interventions.\"\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday issued the second veto of his presidency after Congress in April passed a resolution defying his stance on US support for the Saudi-led coalition in the Yemen conflict.\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who led the charge on this resolution, slammed Trump for his decision.\n\"The people of Yemen desperately need humanitarian help, not more bombs,\" Sanders said in a tweet Tuesday night. \"I am disappointed, but not surprised, that Trump has rejected the bi-partisan resolution to end U.S. involvement in the horrific war in Yemen.\"\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who spearheaded efforts on the resolution in the House, told INSIDER, \"This is very sad and a missed opportunity by the president to stand up for the Constitution. He ignored the views of his allies like Rand Paul, Mark Meadows, and Matt Gaetz, all of whom voted against endless war and these interventions.\"\nAfter the resolution passed in the House, Khanna and a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers wrote a letter urging Trump to sign the resolution.\nSen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement:\n\"This is a huge mistake. The civil war in Yemen is a humanitarian crisis, and we have no business still being a part of it. Republicans and Democrats in Congress voted overwhelmingly to get out and send a strong message to the Saudi government that they can no longer take our alliance for granted.\"\nMurphy added: \"I've been calling on the United States to get out of the civil war in Yemen for the last four years, and this veto won't stop me.\"\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of the Saudi-led war in Yemen, \"this conflict must end, now. The House of Representatives calls on the President to put peace before politics, and work with us to advance an enduring solution to end this crisis and save lives.\"\nRead more: Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul, Ro Khanna, and a bipartisan group of lawmakers sent a letter to Trump imploring him to end US support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen\nIn terms of what can be done next, Khanna added, \"The most urgent task now is for the United States to call on the Saudis to lift the blockade in Yemen so 14 million civilians don't face famine.\"\nThe president justified his veto by describing the Yemen resolution as a \"dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities.\"\nTrump's first veto came after Congress rebuked him and voted to block his national-emergency declaration to obtain funding for a border wall.\nThe resolution, sponsored by Sanders, passed in the Senate in March, and the House followed suit earlier this month.\n\"Today we took a clear stand against war and famine and for Congress' war powers by voting to end our complicity in the war in Yemen,\" Sanders said in a tweet after the vote. \"This is just the beginning of a national debate over when and where we go to war and Congress' authority over those interventions.\"\nThe push for the US to end its support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen gained significant momentum after the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.\nKhashoggi, a Saudi journalist who moved to the US and wrote columns for The Washington Post, was brutally killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. His death sparked outrage worldwide and inspired many US lawmakers to champion a reevaluation of the US-Saudi relations.\nThe CIA reportedly concluded Khashoggi's death was ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the kingdom. Trump has stood by Crown Prince Mohammed and the Saudi government in the wake of Khashoggi's killing, and has largely ignored pressure from lawmakers, including top Republicans, to do more.\nThe passage of the Yemen resolution on Thursday stands as a rebuke of Trump's foreign policy, particularly his controversial reaction to Khashoggi's killing.\nRead more: House passes resolution ending US support for Saudi Arabia in the Yemen war, setting up just the 2nd veto of Trump's presidency\nThe resolution passed by a 247-175 vote, primarily along party lines. It marked the first time in history a resolution invoking the War Powers Act of 1973 was passed in both chambers of Congress.\nResponding to the resolution's success in the House in early April, Khanna in a tweet said, \"Today, the House of Representatives took a clear stand against war and famine by voting to end our complicity in the war in Yemen. This is the first time in the history of this nation that a War Powers Resolution has passed the House and Senate & made it to the President's desk.\"\nRead more: US senators furious with Saudi Arabia after classified briefing with CIA Director Gina Haspel\nThe passage of this resolution highlights growing anti-interventionist sentiments in Congress, particularly among Democrats. It also represents Congress reasserting its war powers and comes as many lawmakers question the broad authority that's been granted to presidents in the post-9/11 world when it comes to armed conflict.\nThe Yemen conflict has generated the worst humanitarian crisis. Approximately 14 million people are facing starvation because of the conflict, which just entered its fifth year, and it's estimated to have killed about 60,000 people.",

He issued his second-ever veto on the resolution Tuesday.\nPresident Donald Trump believes Congress' efforts to strip US military aid for the Saudi-led war in Yemen was meant to be a rebuke for his response to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to anonymous White House officials and congressional aides cited in a Washington Post report published Tuesday.\nKhashoggi, a Saudi journalist who worked for The Post, was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Turkey in October 2018. US intelligence officials reportedly concluded that Saudi Arabia, which Khashoggi criticized in his columns, ordered the assassination of the journalist.\nThe Trump administration's response following Khashoggi's death was tepid, despite the intelligence from US and Turkish agencies. Although the US eventually sanctioned 17 Saudis connected to Khashoggi's death, the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who allegedly sanctioned the act, emerged unscathed.\nCritics have also scrutinized the Trump administration's friendly relationship with Saudi Arabia. The Saudi kingdom is the largest weapons customer, as noted by the Conversation, for the US and spent billions of dollars on missiles \u2014 some of which were used to kill hundreds of Yemeni civilians, The Washington Post reported in March.\nRepublicans and Democrats have criticized the US's military aid to Saudi Arabia. In recent weeks, the House and Senate approved a resolution to end the military aid by invoking the War Powers Act of 1973 for the first time.\nTrump encouraged lawmakers not to vote for the resolution, according to The Post.\nScreenshot/C-Span\nRead more: Bernie Sanders and Ro Khanna slam Trump for refusing to end the 'horrific war in Yemen' with second veto of his presidency\n\"We're helping a foreign power bomb its adversaries in what is undoubtedly, irrefutably, a war,\" Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, a sponsor of the resolution, said last month, according to Reuters.\nTrump issued his second veto during his presidency to shoot down the resolution on Tuesday.\n\"This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,\" Trump said in a statement.\nLawmakers appear to lack the two-thirds vote to override Trump's veto. The original resolution was approved after a 247-175 vote in the House and a 54-46 vote in the Senate.\nFollowing the decision, Democrats urged Trump to reconsider and \"put peace before politics.\"\n\"The conflict in Yemen is a horrific humanitarian crisis that challenges the conscience of the entire world,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. \"Yet the President has cynically chosen to contravene a bipartisan, bicameral vote of the Congress and perpetuate America's shameful involvement in this heartbreaking crisis.\"",

In the wake of their deaths the border agency said it would review its policies on the care and custody of children under 10 and start conducting secondary medical checks on all kids in their custody.\nThe Mexican national who died this week had been apprehended by Border Patrol agents early Sunday near the Bridge of the Americas in El Paso.

That&rsquo;s well on track to exceed 2014&rsquo;s record of 667 cases, the highest number recorded since the disease was declared domestically eradicated in 2000.</p>\n<p>All of the new US outbreaks originally derived from infections transmitted by travelers &mdash; either visitors from overseas, or US residents who went abroad. &ldquo;Every case we have now is associated with travel,&rdquo; Thomas Clark, deputy director of the CDC's viral diseases division, told BuzzFeed News. And with measles cases now surging outside of the US too &mdash; seeing a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/immunization/newsroom/measles-data-2019/en/\">300% global increase</a> this year compared to last &mdash; we are likely to see more cases here, public health experts say.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is unfortunately the new normal,&rdquo; Harvard Medical School epidemiologist John Brownstein told BuzzFeed News. And the booming anti-vaccine movement in the US and across the world is making it harder to keep it in check, he said.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the World Health Organization reported that 170 countries have confirmed more than 112,000 cases so far in 2019. That&rsquo;s probably an underestimate, as only about 1 in 10 actual cases is reported to the WHO. Severe outbreaks in countries such as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/0cd4deb8141742b5903fbef3cb0e8afa\">Madagascar</a>, the Philippines, and Ukraine, among others, are, &ldquo;causing many deaths &mdash; mostly among young children,&rdquo; according to the health agency. Those epidemics are leading to outbreaks even in countries with good overall vaccination rates, such as Israel, Thailand, and the US.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Absolutely what we are seeing is that under-vaccinated areas in the US are the kindling and the huge numbers of infections overseas are the spark that ignites outbreaks here,&rdquo; Baylor College of Medicine infectious disease expert Peter Hotez told BuzzFeed News.</p>\n<p>Measles is largely preventable by <a href=\"http://sites.nationalacademies.org/BasedOnScience/vaccines-are-safe/index.htm?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=BOSVac&utm_content=1\">vaccination</a>, which stops transmission of the disease after a second dose in 97% of cases and lessens its severity in rare cases that slip through. But the virus is highly contagious: If exposed to someone with the virus, 9 out of 10 unvaccinated people will get sick themselves.

That\u2019s well on track to exceed 2014\u2019s record of 667 cases, the highest number recorded since the disease was declared domestically eradicated in 2000.\nAll of the new US outbreaks originally derived from infections transmitted by travelers \u2014 either visitors from overseas, or US residents who went abroad. \u201cEvery case we have now is associated with travel,\u201d Thomas Clark, deputy director of the CDC's viral diseases division, told BuzzFeed News. And with measles cases now surging outside of the US too \u2014 seeing a 300% global increase this year compared to last \u2014 we are likely to see more cases here, public health experts say.\n\u201cIt is unfortunately the new normal,\u201d Harvard Medical School epidemiologist John Brownstein told BuzzFeed News. And the booming anti-vaccine movement in the US and across the world is making it harder to keep it in check, he said.\nOn Monday, the World Health Organization reported that 170 countries have confirmed more than 112,000 cases so far in 2019. That\u2019s probably an underestimate, as only about 1 in 10 actual cases is reported to the WHO. Severe outbreaks in countries such as Madagascar, the Philippines, and Ukraine, among others, are, \u201ccausing many deaths \u2014 mostly among young children,\u201d according to the health agency. Those epidemics are leading to outbreaks even in countries with good overall vaccination rates, such as Israel, Thailand, and the US.\n\u201cAbsolutely what we are seeing is that under-vaccinated areas in the US are the kindling and the huge numbers of infections overseas are the spark that ignites outbreaks here,\u201d Baylor College of Medicine infectious disease expert Peter Hotez told BuzzFeed News.\nMeasles is largely preventable by vaccination, which stops transmission of the disease after a second dose in 97% of cases and lessens its severity in rare cases that slip through. But the virus is highly contagious: If exposed to someone with the virus, 9 out of 10 unvaccinated people will get sick themselves. That means communities need to have a high rate of overall vaccination, around 95%, to provide \u201cherd immunity\" to the disease.\nAbout half of the US outbreaks have happened in close-knit religious or ethnic communities, said Clark, \u201cthat can be insular or, for whatever reason, resistant to vaccination.\u201d\nThe biggest US outbreak, nearly 300 reported cases in New York City, has largely struck the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn, for example, and traces to an outbreak in Israel. That Brooklyn community and another Jewish group in Rockland County, New York, where 180 cases have been reported, were targeted by anti-vaccination propaganda efforts, according to local public health officials, another growing factor in the outbreaks.\nMeasles kills about 2 in 1,000 of its victims, and leads to pneumonia in about 6% of cases. It can cause miscarriages and is especially dangerous to infants too young for a vaccination. The jab has prevented an estimated 936,000 deaths from 1994 to 2018, and overall, more than 91% of US kids are vaccinated against measles. There is no evidence linking vaccination to autism, as some vaccine critics claim, most recently debunked in a study of 657,000 Danish children.\nHotez says that online merchants such as Amazon, which tops its search categories for books about vaccines with ones making bogus claims about their dangers, and social media networks such as Facebook are spurring measles outbreaks by promoting anti-vax propaganda. (A book he wrote about his daughter\u2019s autism, Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism: My Journey as a Vaccine Scientist, Pediatrician, and Autism Dad, is ranked below 20 anti-vaccine books in the vaccine category on Amazon, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I know. What author doesn\u2019t check his Amazon rank?\u201d)\n\u201cWe need these online outfits to take steps, for more than just show or the optics, to stop this anti-vaccination propaganda that is making people sick,\u201d he said.\nLast year, Hotez and colleagues reported that 15 US cities, mainly in Western states, have communities with a high number of unvaccinated kindergartners. \u201cWe are seeing outbreaks in eight of those now,\u201d he said.\nGiven the higher risks of measles outbreaks, he said, it\u2019s time to end nonmedical or religious exemptions for vaccination, allowed in most states.\n\u201cWe have found that the easier it is to get an exemption, the lower the vaccination rate,\u201d said Clark of the CDC. But public health agencies have to walk a line in reaching out to communities that are resistant to vaccination, he added. During an outbreak, increased public attention \u2014 such as New York\u2019s new $1,000 fines for failing to vaccinate in certain zip codes \u2014 can boost rates.\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t come in as outsiders and tell people what to do and build trust with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat requires a lot more careful, long-term work with people in their own community.\u201d",

The case is one of four in which judges issued nationwide injunctions that blocked the policy from being implemented. Courts had lifted three of the injunctions while all of the legal challenges continue &mdash; though the status of this fourth injunction in the DC court was disputed.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department argued that when the DC Court of Appeals vacated the injunction in January, it ceased to exist and the Pentagon was free to instate a ban. LGBT advocacy lawyers countered that the appellate court still hadn&rsquo;t issued a mandate to lift the injunction, because a series of procedural steps had to first be undertaken while the plaintiffs decide to request a rehearing.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration issued its memo to set up the ban anyway.</p>\n<p>That led to Tuesday&rsquo;s decision from Kollar-Kotelly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;On October 30, 2017, this Court ordered Defendants to maintain the status quo as it relates to the accession and retention of transgender individuals in the military,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That preliminary injunction remains in place until the D.C. Circuit issues its mandate vacating the preliminary injunction.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs in the DC court have until March 29 to request a rehearing before the full bench of judges at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Doing so could extend the timeline for the injunction to remain in place.</p>\n<p>In June 2016, the Obama administration lifted a decadeslong ban on transgender people serving in the armed forces after finding they wouldn't harm the military. Trump reversed that decision in 2017, saying that transgender people would render the military &ldquo;burdened with medical costs and disruption.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump formalized his policy in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-secretary-defense-secretary-homeland-security/\">memorandum</a> that August &mdash; but courts issued preliminary injunctions putting Trump&rsquo;s ambitions on hold. In an effort to bypass those injunctions, Trump&rsquo;s policy evolved in February 2018, when former defense secretary James Mattis recommended banning most transgender personnel but allowing those who&rsquo;d already joined and transitioned to remain in the ranks, which was the blueprint for the ban released this month.</p>",

Matt Gaetz, a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexislevinson/matt-gaetz-ultimate-trump-defender-is-happy-being-notorious\">Trump loyalist</a> who has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-investigations.html\">spearheaded</a> efforts to undermine the investigations into Russian election interference, went on Twitter to accuse Cohen, without evidence, of having an extramarital affair.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do your wife &amp; father-in-law know about your girlfriends?&rdquo; Gaetz <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/mattgaetz/status/1100503846386835456\">tweeted</a> at Cohen. &ldquo;Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she&rsquo;ll remain faithful when you&rsquo;re in prison. She&rsquo;s about to learn a lot&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gaetz sent the tweet as Cohen was nearing his seventh hour of testimony behind closed doors to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is leading the congressional Russia investigations, and the day before he is slated to testify in public before the House Oversight Committee.</p>\n<figure>  <picture> <source media=\"(min-width: 52rem)\" srcset=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-02/26/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/sub-buzz-6022-1551218091-1.png?crop=662%3A291%3B3%2C6&downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto 1600w\"></source> <source srcset=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-02/26/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/sub-buzz-6022-1551218091-1.png?crop=662%3A291%3B3%2C6&downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto 800w\"></source> <img alt=\"\" data-bfa=\"@o:{ignore:[bfaBinder]};\" src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-02/26/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/sub-buzz-6022-1551218091-1.png?crop=662%3A291%3B3%2C6&downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&downsize=360:*\"></img> </picture>  <figcaption>Rep.

I'm sorry.&quot;</p>\n<figure> <blockquote>   <p>Speaker, I want to get the truth too. While it is important 2 create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen, it was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did.

I&rsquo;m sorry. https://t.co/Rdbw3sTQJD</p>    </blockquote> </figure>\n<p>Cohen, who pleaded guilty last year to lying to the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2017 about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the presidential campaign, is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s Russia investigation and has pledged to tell Congress the truth in a series of hearings this week.</p>\n<p>Reports Tuesday suggested Cohen <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1100459136381317121\">was telling</a> investigators about his previous lies to them. BuzzFeed News <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">reported</a> in January that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress about when the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations ended in order to obscure his own involvement. Mueller&rsquo;s office later issued a statement disputing unspecified elements of that report. BuzzFeed News stands by its story and the two law enforcement sources who informed it.</p>\n<figure>   <img alt=\"\" data-bfa=\"@o:{ignore:[bfaBinder]};\" data-crop=\"77.92\" data-mobile-crop=\"77.98\" data-mobile-src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-02/26/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/sub-buzz-25288-1551217191-1.jpg?resize=990:772\" data-span=\"1\" data-src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-02/26/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/sub-buzz-25288-1551217191-1.jpg\" src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-02/26/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/sub-buzz-25288-1551217191-1.jpg?resize=990:772\"></img>    Mark Wilson / Getty Images    <figcaption>MIchael Cohen testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday, the first of three days of congressional testimony on Capitol Hill this week.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Lanny Davis, one of Cohen&rsquo;s attorneys, called Gaetz&rsquo;s tweet a &ldquo;new low&rdquo; in a statement. &ldquo;We will not respond to Mr. Gaetz&rsquo;s despicable lies and personal smears except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House, both Republicans and Democrats, will repudiate his words,&rdquo; Davis said.</p>\n<p>Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about when discussions related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal ended. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, noted that Cohen&rsquo;s false claim that the project discussions concluded in January 2016 was an attempt to &ldquo;minimize links between the Moscow Project and Individual 1&rdquo; &mdash; widely understood to be Trump &mdash; &ldquo;in hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He apologized,&rdquo; Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic member of the committee, said of Cohen on Tuesday. &ldquo;He said he&rsquo;s going away, he understands, and I think he made efforts to be absolutely truthful. But I think if you don&rsquo;t know what the truth is, it&rsquo;s not so easy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cohen is scheduled to testify before two more committees this week: On Wednesday, he&rsquo;ll appear publicly before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, and is <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/michael-cohen-will-give-congress-evidence-trump-criminal-conduct-source-n976046\">reportedly</a> expected to accuse Trump of criminal conduct, racism, and more during that hearing. On Thursday, Cohen will appear privately before the House Intelligence Committee, which &mdash; like its Senate counterpart &mdash; is investigating Russian election meddling.</p>\n<p>Gaetz, though not a member of the Oversight Committee, had suggested on Tuesday that there would be &ldquo;fireworks&rdquo; related to his allegations against Cohen at the Wednesday hearing.</p>\n<figure> <blockquote>   <p>My short text convo with @mattgaetz just now: Me: Congressman, Any chance you have a few minutes to discuss what you implied with your tweet to Michael Cohen? Perhaps a preview? Gaetz: Watch tomorrow. Me: Will do -- anything I should be prepared for? Gaetz: Fireworks https://t.co/g1bwYcjvrg</p>    </blockquote> </figure>\n<p>Gaetz denied in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-ally-rep-matt-gaetz-insists-hes-not-threatening-michael-cohen-by-suggesting-his-wife-will-leave-him/?via=twitter_page\">the Daily Beast</a> Tuesday afternoon that he was threatening Cohen, saying his tweet was &ldquo;challenging the veracity and character of a witness. We do it everyday. We typically do it during people&rsquo;s testimony.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is what it looks like to compete in the marketplace of ideas,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>A Gaetz spokesperson told BuzzFeed News Tuesday evening the congressman's tweet spoke for itself.</p>\n<p>Democrats have already accused Trump of trying to intimidate Cohen before his testimony to Congress. Cohen canceled his first scheduled public appearance before the Oversight Committee because of what Davis described as &ldquo;threats against [Cohen&rsquo;s] family.&rdquo; The cancellation followed a tweet from Trump accusing Cohen of lying to get a reduced sentence. &ldquo;Watch father-in-law!&rdquo; Trump added. Trump has also previously <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1074313153679450113\">called</a> Cohen a &ldquo;rat&rdquo; &mdash; a common mob term &mdash; for cooperating with Mueller&rsquo;s probe.</p>\n<p>Cohen eventually rescheduled the public hearing for this week, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1098378159685337090\">warned</a> that &ldquo;any efforts to intimidate family members or pressure witnesses will not be tolerated.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure> <blockquote>   <p>Michael Cohen will come before the @OversightDems &amp;amp; @HouseIntel Committees next week. Congress has an independent duty under the Constitution to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch, and any efforts to intimidate family members or pressure witnesses will not be tolerated. https://t.co/VDc6zE6lwH</p>    </blockquote> </figure>\n<p>On Tuesday, a spokesperson for Pelosi referred BuzzFeed News to her previous tweet. &ldquo;Looking into whether this is some violation of sorts,&rdquo; the spokesperson added.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1100545912697511938\">tweeted</a> statement Tuesday night, Pelosi said that all members should &ldquo;be mindful that comments made on social media or in the press can adversely affect the ability of House Committees to obtain the truthful and complete information necessary to fulfill their duties&rdquo; and that the House Ethics Committee, which can punish members of Congress, &ldquo;should vigilantly monitor these types of statements.&rdquo; She did not mention Gaetz by name.</p>\n<p>Asked about Gaetz&rsquo;s tweet, Rep. Elijah Cummings, who chairs the Oversight Committee, said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m focused on making sure that the American people hear what Mr. Cohen has to say. I have razor focus on that. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cummings also said he hadn&rsquo;t spoken to Gaetz about the tweet, adding, &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for Twitter, which can suspend accounts for threatening behavior, said its rules likely wouldn&rsquo;t apply here because the tweet didn&rsquo;t contain a violent threat. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that we would consider it a threat given that there&rsquo;s no threat of violence. If it&rsquo;s tampering, it&rsquo;s something for Congress and the courts to decide,&rdquo; the spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the special counsel&rsquo;s office declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Cohen, who was sentenced to three years in prison in December for a range of federal charges, is set to report to prison May 9.</p>\n<p><i>Lissandra Villa, Ryan Mac, Nidhi Prakash, and Zoe Tillman contributed reporting to this story.</i></p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A Republican member of Congress and close ally of President Donald Trump accused Michael Cohen of infidelity on Tuesday, raising questions about witness intimidation as Trump\u2019s former personal attorney and fixer testifies before Congress this week.\nFlorida Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Trump loyalist who has spearheaded efforts to undermine the investigations into Russian election interference, went on Twitter to accuse Cohen, without evidence, of having an extramarital affair.\n\u201cDo your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends?\u201d Gaetz tweeted at Cohen. \u201cMaybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she\u2019ll remain faithful when you\u2019re in prison. She\u2019s about to learn a lot\u2026\u201d\nGaetz sent the tweet as Cohen was nearing his seventh hour of testimony behind closed doors to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is leading the congressional Russia investigations, and the day before he is slated to testify in public before the House Oversight Committee.\nAfter defending his statement earlier Tuesday, saying it wasn't meant as a threat, Gaetz deleted his tweet and apologized, saying, \"I should have chosen words that better showed my intent. I'm sorry.\"\nSpeaker, I want to get the truth too. While it is important 2 create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen, it was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did. I\u2019m deleting the tweet &amp; I should have chosen words that better showed my intent. I\u2019m sorry. https://t.co/Rdbw3sTQJD\nCohen, who pleaded guilty last year to lying to the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2017 about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the presidential campaign, is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and has pledged to tell Congress the truth in a series of hearings this week.\nReports Tuesday suggested Cohen was telling investigators about his previous lies to them. BuzzFeed News reported in January that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress about when the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations ended in order to obscure his own involvement. Mueller\u2019s office later issued a statement disputing unspecified elements of that report. BuzzFeed News stands by its story and the two law enforcement sources who informed it.\nLanny Davis, one of Cohen\u2019s attorneys, called Gaetz\u2019s tweet a \u201cnew low\u201d in a statement. \u201cWe will not respond to Mr. Gaetz\u2019s despicable lies and personal smears except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House, both Republicans and Democrats, will repudiate his words,\u201d Davis said.\nCohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about when discussions related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal ended. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, noted that Cohen\u2019s false claim that the project discussions concluded in January 2016 was an attempt to \u201cminimize links between the Moscow Project and Individual 1\u201d \u2014 widely understood to be Trump \u2014 \u201cin hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations.\u201d\n\u201cHe apologized,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic member of the committee, said of Cohen on Tuesday. \u201cHe said he\u2019s going away, he understands, and I think he made efforts to be absolutely truthful. But I think if you don\u2019t know what the truth is, it\u2019s not so easy.\u201d\nCohen is scheduled to testify before two more committees this week: On Wednesday, he\u2019ll appear publicly before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, and is reportedly expected to accuse Trump of criminal conduct, racism, and more during that hearing. On Thursday, Cohen will appear privately before the House Intelligence Committee, which \u2014 like its Senate counterpart \u2014 is investigating Russian election meddling.\nGaetz, though not a member of the Oversight Committee, had suggested on Tuesday that there would be \u201cfireworks\u201d related to his allegations against Cohen at the Wednesday hearing.\nMy short text convo with @mattgaetz just now: Me: Congressman, Any chance you have a few minutes to discuss what you implied with your tweet to Michael Cohen? Perhaps a preview? Gaetz: Watch tomorrow. Me: Will do -- anything I should be prepared for? Gaetz: Fireworks https://t.co/g1bwYcjvrg\nGaetz denied in an interview with the Daily Beast Tuesday afternoon that he was threatening Cohen, saying his tweet was \u201cchallenging the veracity and character of a witness. We do it everyday. We typically do it during people\u2019s testimony.\u201d\n\u201cThis is what it looks like to compete in the marketplace of ideas,\u201d he said.\nA Gaetz spokesperson told BuzzFeed News Tuesday evening the congressman's tweet spoke for itself.\nDemocrats have already accused Trump of trying to intimidate Cohen before his testimony to Congress. Cohen canceled his first scheduled public appearance before the Oversight Committee because of what Davis described as \u201cthreats against [Cohen\u2019s] family.\u201d The cancellation followed a tweet from Trump accusing Cohen of lying to get a reduced sentence. \u201cWatch father-in-law!\u201d Trump added. Trump has also previously called Cohen a \u201crat\u201d \u2014 a common mob term \u2014 for cooperating with Mueller\u2019s probe.\nCohen eventually rescheduled the public hearing for this week, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned that \u201cany efforts to intimidate family members or pressure witnesses will not be tolerated.\u201d\nMichael Cohen will come before the @OversightDems &amp; @HouseIntel Committees next week. Congress has an independent duty under the Constitution to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch, and any efforts to intimidate family members or pressure witnesses will not be tolerated. https://t.co/VDc6zE6lwH\nOn Tuesday, a spokesperson for Pelosi referred BuzzFeed News to her previous tweet. \u201cLooking into whether this is some violation of sorts,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nIn a tweeted statement Tuesday night, Pelosi said that all members should \u201cbe mindful that comments made on social media or in the press can adversely affect the ability of House Committees to obtain the truthful and complete information necessary to fulfill their duties\u201d and that the House Ethics Committee, which can punish members of Congress, \u201cshould vigilantly monitor these types of statements.\u201d She did not mention Gaetz by name.\nAsked about Gaetz\u2019s tweet, Rep. Elijah Cummings, who chairs the Oversight Committee, said, \u201cI\u2019m focused on making sure that the American people hear what Mr. Cohen has to say. I have razor focus on that. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nCummings also said he hadn\u2019t spoken to Gaetz about the tweet, adding, \u201cFor what?\u201d\nA spokesperson for Twitter, which can suspend accounts for threatening behavior, said its rules likely wouldn\u2019t apply here because the tweet didn\u2019t contain a violent threat. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we would consider it a threat given that there\u2019s no threat of violence. If it\u2019s tampering, it\u2019s something for Congress and the courts to decide,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nA spokesperson for the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment.\nCohen, who was sentenced to three years in prison in December for a range of federal charges, is set to report to prison May 9.\nLissandra Villa, Ryan Mac, Nidhi Prakash, and Zoe Tillman contributed reporting to this story.",

We do everything by family meetings, because no man or woman has a right to run for high public office without it being a family decision. And from being pushed &mdash; pushed, prodded &mdash; by my son Hunter, and my wife Jill, and my daughter, there is &hellip; we just had a family meeting with all the grandkids, too. And there&rsquo;s a consensus that, I should, they want &mdash; <i>they</i>, the most important people in my life &mdash; want me to run.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Though Biden is confident his family is on board, &ldquo;the second piece,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that I don&rsquo;t want this to be a fool&rsquo;s errand. And I want to make sure, if we do this &mdash; and we&rsquo;re very close to getting to a decision &mdash; that I am fully prepared to do it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Biden, 76, would join a large field of Democrats looking to challenge President Donald Trump. More than a half dozen prominent candidates have already launched campaigns or exploratory committees. Others are likely to join the race soon.</p>\n<p>The Democratic Party, and the political environment at large, has changed since Biden was vice president under Barack Obama. &ldquo;For example,&rdquo; Biden noted Tuesday, &ldquo;from the last time Barack and I ran &hellip; the whole issue of social media and the use of social media has fundamentally changed. And so we&rsquo;ve been getting briefings from the most advanced people in the country who run these major platforms.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Funding a campaign &ldquo;on my conditions&rdquo; is another challenge, Biden said. Long a fixture of the Democratic establishment, he said to applause Tuesday that he will &ldquo;not be a part of a super PAC&rdquo; and indicated he would not accept money from such organizations &mdash; a progressive stance adopted by many candidates already in the race. He added that he&rsquo;s received offers from Democratic donors and some Republicans.</p>\n<p>The exchange came near the end of a 90-minute forum with Meacham, who was at the inaugural Biden School event to promote his book, <i>The Soul of America</i>. Biden, ostensibly, was supposed to interview Meacham, but Meacham, a journalist, at several points tried to steer the conversation to Biden&rsquo;s future plans.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I would be remiss in not asking this,&rdquo; Meacham finally ventured. &ldquo;There are a number of people in this room and around this country who would very much like to see your character back in the arena. So what are you confident&mdash; what are you able to tell us at this point about your thinking?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Biden appeared to speak off the cuff and had one long pause as he began his long and winding answer. At one point, Biden, who has made two previous presidential bids and nearly ran in 2016, said he could &ldquo;die a happy man never having lived in the White House&rdquo; and that he would not want to waste people&rsquo;s time if he doesn&rsquo;t have a clear shot at the nomination.</p>\n<p>A moment later, a member of the audience shouted &ldquo;Just say yes!&rdquo; Others joined in applause.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not there yet,&rdquo; Biden said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to mislead you. I&rsquo;m being straight-forward. Look, no one&rsquo;s ever doubted I mean what I say. The problem is I sometimes say all that I mean. And so this has to be &mdash; we&rsquo;re in the final stages of that decision. But it would, you know, be the greatest honor of my life to be president of the United States, but also it&rsquo;s something that I have to make sure that I could run a first-rate effort to do this, and make clear where I think the country should go and how to get there. That&rsquo;s the process going on right now. That&rsquo;s as straightforward as I can be. I have not made the final decision, but don&rsquo;t be surprised.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside data-bfa=\"@l:Related-Links\"> <h2>More on Joe Biden</h2>  </aside>",

                "text": "Joe Biden indicated Tuesday that he has cleared a significant hurdle as he decides whether to run for president in 2020.\nThe former vice president \u2014 in a freewheeling discussion with author Jon Meacham at the newly christened Biden School of Public Policy and Administration at the University of Delaware \u2014 said there\u2019s a \u201cconsensus\u201d among his family that he should join the Democratic primary race.\n\u201cI\u2019ll just tell you straight up,\u201d Biden said, responding to a question from Meacham during the livestreamed event. \u201cI know the people of Delaware may not be surprised by this, but others might. We do everything by family meetings, because no man or woman has a right to run for high public office without it being a family decision. And from being pushed \u2014 pushed, prodded \u2014 by my son Hunter, and my wife Jill, and my daughter, there is \u2026 we just had a family meeting with all the grandkids, too. And there\u2019s a consensus that, I should, they want \u2014 they, the most important people in my life \u2014 want me to run.\u201d\nThough Biden is confident his family is on board, \u201cthe second piece,\u201d he said, \u201cis that I don\u2019t want this to be a fool\u2019s errand. And I want to make sure, if we do this \u2014 and we\u2019re very close to getting to a decision \u2014 that I am fully prepared to do it.\u201d\nBiden, 76, would join a large field of Democrats looking to challenge President Donald Trump. More than a half dozen prominent candidates have already launched campaigns or exploratory committees. Others are likely to join the race soon.\nThe Democratic Party, and the political environment at large, has changed since Biden was vice president under Barack Obama. \u201cFor example,\u201d Biden noted Tuesday, \u201cfrom the last time Barack and I ran \u2026 the whole issue of social media and the use of social media has fundamentally changed. And so we\u2019ve been getting briefings from the most advanced people in the country who run these major platforms.\u201d\nFunding a campaign \u201con my conditions\u201d is another challenge, Biden said. Long a fixture of the Democratic establishment, he said to applause Tuesday that he will \u201cnot be a part of a super PAC\u201d and indicated he would not accept money from such organizations \u2014 a progressive stance adopted by many candidates already in the race. He added that he\u2019s received offers from Democratic donors and some Republicans.\nThe exchange came near the end of a 90-minute forum with Meacham, who was at the inaugural Biden School event to promote his book, The Soul of America. Biden, ostensibly, was supposed to interview Meacham, but Meacham, a journalist, at several points tried to steer the conversation to Biden\u2019s future plans.\n\u201cI would be remiss in not asking this,\u201d Meacham finally ventured. \u201cThere are a number of people in this room and around this country who would very much like to see your character back in the arena. So what are you confident\u2014 what are you able to tell us at this point about your thinking?\u201d\nBiden appeared to speak off the cuff and had one long pause as he began his long and winding answer. At one point, Biden, who has made two previous presidential bids and nearly ran in 2016, said he could \u201cdie a happy man never having lived in the White House\u201d and that he would not want to waste people\u2019s time if he doesn\u2019t have a clear shot at the nomination.\nA moment later, a member of the audience shouted \u201cJust say yes!\u201d Others joined in applause.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not there yet,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to mislead you. I\u2019m being straight-forward. Look, no one\u2019s ever doubted I mean what I say. The problem is I sometimes say all that I mean. And so this has to be \u2014 we\u2019re in the final stages of that decision. But it would, you know, be the greatest honor of my life to be president of the United States, but also it\u2019s something that I have to make sure that I could run a first-rate effort to do this, and make clear where I think the country should go and how to get there. That\u2019s the process going on right now. That\u2019s as straightforward as I can be. I have not made the final decision, but don\u2019t be surprised.\u201d\nMore on Joe Biden",

Jack Cera &mdash; who, like Brown, is a Democrat &mdash; introduced the bill this week.</p>\n<p>In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Cera said he believes March primaries, which in Ohio only occur during presidential years, are an unfair burden on local elections administrators and candidates who have a narrower window to prepare for the next election.</p>\n<p>Cera has not discussed his bill with Brown and said it is not his intention to hurt his chances. Brown, who is weighing a campaign, would join a large field and could benefit from a strong Ohio showing early on the primary calendar. A May contest could be too late for Brown. One state that could be positioned to benefit a native candidate: California, where Sen. Kamala Harris could clean up on Super Tuesday, March 3.</p>\n<p>Under <a href=\"http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3513\">current Ohio law</a>, the state&rsquo;s 2020 primary would be March 10. Primaries are set for early May every other year.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my last term,&rdquo; Cera joked, &ldquo;so I figured I&rsquo;d stir up as much shit as I can.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Brown has been preparing a presidential campaign for months, and this weekend he will wrap up a tour of early-voting states with a trip to South Carolina. He is expected to announce his decision next month. Representatives from his political team did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Another Ohio Democrat, Rep. Tim Ryan from the Youngstown area, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/henrygomez/rep-tim-ryan-is-heading-to-iowa-and-new-hampshire-as-he\">also is considering a run</a>. He&rsquo;s kept a lower profile than Brown but recently visited New Hampshire, the first primary state, and is expected to visit Iowa, the first caucus state, in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>The Cera bill is at the mercy of a Republican-controlled legislature, where lawmakers might factor in political integrity and the possibility of messing with one of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s potential Democratic rivals. But one top state Republican told BuzzFeed News such a move was not on the party&rsquo;s radar and wasn&rsquo;t sure it would be a priority.</p>\n<p>Ohio has been holding March presidential primaries &mdash; often in the Super Tuesday mix with other states &mdash; since 1996. Four years ago, Ohio Republicans successfully pushed the primary back a week in March, a move that enabled John Kasich, then the state&rsquo;s governor, to collect all the delegates up for grabs there that day. It was the only primary Kasich won. He lasted in the race until May, the last candidate to drop out against Trump.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It never seems to work it the way they they think it will,&rdquo; Cera said of Ohio's March primaries and candidates.</p>\n<p>But Cera, a veteran Ohio lawmaker, also remembers 1984, the last time the state had a top-tier Democratic presidential candidate: then-senator John Glenn. &ldquo;I still have my Glenn &lsquo;84 badge,&rdquo; Cera said.</p>\n<p>Glenn struggled in Iowa and New Hampshire that year and was out of the race after a poor Super Tuesday showing. Ohio&rsquo;s primary wasn&rsquo;t until May.</p>\n<aside data-bfa=\"@l:Related-Links\"> <h2>More on Sherrod Brown</h2>  </aside>",

                "text": "Ohio lawmakers could soon consider legislation that would move the state\u2019s 2020 primary from March to May and potentially weaken a presidential bid by the state\u2019s senior senator, Sherrod Brown.\nState Rep. Jack Cera \u2014 who, like Brown, is a Democrat \u2014 introduced the bill this week.\nIn an interview with BuzzFeed News, Cera said he believes March primaries, which in Ohio only occur during presidential years, are an unfair burden on local elections administrators and candidates who have a narrower window to prepare for the next election.\nCera has not discussed his bill with Brown and said it is not his intention to hurt his chances. Brown, who is weighing a campaign, would join a large field and could benefit from a strong Ohio showing early on the primary calendar. A May contest could be too late for Brown. One state that could be positioned to benefit a native candidate: California, where Sen. Kamala Harris could clean up on Super Tuesday, March 3.\nUnder current Ohio law, the state\u2019s 2020 primary would be March 10. Primaries are set for early May every other year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my last term,\u201d Cera joked, \u201cso I figured I\u2019d stir up as much shit as I can.\u201d\nBrown has been preparing a presidential campaign for months, and this weekend he will wrap up a tour of early-voting states with a trip to South Carolina. He is expected to announce his decision next month. Representatives from his political team did not respond to a request for comment.\nAnother Ohio Democrat, Rep. Tim Ryan from the Youngstown area, also is considering a run. He\u2019s kept a lower profile than Brown but recently visited New Hampshire, the first primary state, and is expected to visit Iowa, the first caucus state, in the coming weeks.\nThe Cera bill is at the mercy of a Republican-controlled legislature, where lawmakers might factor in political integrity and the possibility of messing with one of President Donald Trump\u2019s potential Democratic rivals. But one top state Republican told BuzzFeed News such a move was not on the party\u2019s radar and wasn\u2019t sure it would be a priority.\nOhio has been holding March presidential primaries \u2014 often in the Super Tuesday mix with other states \u2014 since 1996. Four years ago, Ohio Republicans successfully pushed the primary back a week in March, a move that enabled John Kasich, then the state\u2019s governor, to collect all the delegates up for grabs there that day. It was the only primary Kasich won. He lasted in the race until May, the last candidate to drop out against Trump.\n\u201cIt never seems to work it the way they they think it will,\u201d Cera said of Ohio's March primaries and candidates.\nBut Cera, a veteran Ohio lawmaker, also remembers 1984, the last time the state had a top-tier Democratic presidential candidate: then-senator John Glenn. \u201cI still have my Glenn \u201884 badge,\u201d Cera said.\nGlenn struggled in Iowa and New Hampshire that year and was out of the race after a poor Super Tuesday showing. Ohio\u2019s primary wasn\u2019t until May.\nMore on Sherrod Brown",

Now, for brands that are a part of Instagram&rsquo;s initial invite-only beta test, you&rsquo;ll be able to tap a product tag on a post and then buy the item within the app. Previously, tapping on a product tag directed users to an external website.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works: After clicking on a product tag from a brand partnering with Instagram, you&rsquo;ll see an option to &ldquo;Checkout on Instagram&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll be able to select a color and size, if applicable. Then, you&rsquo;ll enter an email address, delivery information, and input credit card details or link a PayPal account, which Instagram will save for future orders. If you want, you can add a PIN for purchases to make your Instagram account more secure.</p>\n<figure>  <picture> <source media=\"(min-width: 52rem)\" srcset=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-03/18/20/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-17267-1552954398-1.png?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto 1600w\"></source> <source srcset=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-03/18/20/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-17267-1552954398-1.png?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto 800w\"></source> <img alt=\"\" data-bfa=\"@o:{ignore:[bfaBinder]};\" src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-03/18/20/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-17267-1552954398-1.png?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&downsize=360:*\"></img> </picture>  <figcaption>Instagram / Zara</figcaption></figure>\n<p>An Instagram spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that for now, users can only purchase one item at a time on Instagram, but the team is &ldquo;actively exploring ways&rdquo; to improve the experience, including adding a multi-item shopping cart. Currently, the experience is limited to mobile, and does not work on the desktop version of Instagram. Instagram plans to eventually expand the checkout beta test, which will run through the end of the year, to include more retailers. The spokesperson also said that posts with product tags are not given more visibility in users&rsquo; feeds, and will be &ldquo;treated like any other post.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Instagram is charging the brands a selling fee (which it won&rsquo;t disclose) to cover services such as its <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/300557977301126/?ref=learn_more\">purchase protection policy</a>. That means if something you order through the app is damaged in transit, or is different than as described, and the merchant won&rsquo;t refund you, Instagram will issue a refund for the full purchase price and shipping costs.</p>\n<figure>   <img alt=\"\" data-bfa=\"@o:{ignore:[bfaBinder]};\" data-crop=\"177.92\" data-loaded=\"1\" data-mobile-crop=\"177.87\" data-mobile-src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-03/18/20/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-17631-1552954722-1.png\" data-pin-media=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-03/18/20/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-17631-1552954722-1.png?downsize=400:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto\" data-span=\"1\" data-src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-03/18/20/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-17631-1552954722-1.png\" src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-03/18/20/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-02/sub-buzz-17631-1552954722-1.png?downsize=400:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto\"></img>  <figcaption>Instagram / Huda Beauty</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The feature could potentially boost sales for smaller, independent brands or sellers in other marketplaces, like Etsy, who have protested <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/leticiamiranda/sellers-are-threatening-to-leave-etsy-after-it-raised-fees\">increased transaction fees</a> on the marketplaces where they sell. However, for now, Instagram checkout is aimed at larger, more established companies.</p>\n<p>Instagram has become increasingly important to the bottom line of its parent company Facebook. Some analysts expect Instagram to <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/10/9/17938356/facebook-instagram-future-revenue-growth-kevin-systrom\">drive the majority</a> of Facebook&rsquo;s ad revenue growth by 2020.</p>\n<p>The move to develop a robust shopping experience signals the social network&rsquo;s interest in cashing in on purchases inspired by its content, but transacted elsewhere. Instagram has long been a sort of shopping <a href=\"https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/on-instagram-a-bazaar-where-you-least-expect-it/\">bazaar</a> for <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-26/new-breed-of-shoppers-races-to-instagram-to-buy-vintage-clothes\">vintage pieces</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/instagram-etsy-vintage-shopping?verso=true\">other items of carefully curated clothing</a>. The way the informal marketplace worked historically was low tech: Users could &ldquo;claim&rdquo; items by commenting on a post with their PayPal-linked email first, or they could purchase the items through a link in the account&rsquo;s bio.</p>\n<p>Since then, Instagram has become a critical marketing tool for online-only, direct-to-consumer products, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nitashatiku/inside-glossier-the-beauty-startup-that-just-happens-to-sell\">makeup</a> to <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/leticiamiranda/online-only-casper-just-opened-physical-store-nyc\">mattresses</a> &mdash; and more people are buying from these brands. A recent RetailDive study found that <a href=\"https://www.retaildive.com/news/81-of-consumers-plan-to-shop-direct-to-consumer-brands/539087/\">81% of Americans</a> said that they&rsquo;ll make at least one purchase from a direct-to-consumer company in the next five years. The activewear outfitter Outdoor Voices, one of Instagram&rsquo;s first checkout partners, is one such brand that makes the majority of its sales online. This new checkout feature is just Instagram&rsquo;s latest effort to bring more shopping to the platform. Over the past year, the app has added shopping to <a href=\"https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/06/12/shopping-in-instagram-stories/\">stories</a>, a channel dedicated to Shopping in the app&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/09/17/new-ways-to-shop-on-instagram/\">explore tab</a>, and a <a href=\"https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/11/15/introducing-more-ways-to-shop-on-instagram/\">new profile view</a> showcasing only products from shopping posts.</p>\n<p>And with the added ability to check out on Instagram, the company can now collect data on not just what you&rsquo;re interested in, but what you actually spend your money on.</p>\n<p>The full list of brands launching with Instagram&rsquo;s new checkout feature includes: Adidas, Anastasia Beverly Hills, Balmain, Burberry, ColourPop, Dior, Huda Beauty, H&amp;M, KKW Beauty, MAC Cosmetics, Michael Kors, NARS, Nike, Oscar de la Renta, Outdoor Voices, Ouai Hair, Prada, Revolve, Uniqlo, Warby Parker, and Zara.</p>",

                "text": "Starting today, people in the US can purchase items directly on Instagram\u2019s app from over 20 different brands, including Zara, H&M, Outdoor Voices, and Uniqlo. Now, for brands that are a part of Instagram\u2019s initial invite-only beta test, you\u2019ll be able to tap a product tag on a post and then buy the item within the app. Previously, tapping on a product tag directed users to an external website.\nHere\u2019s how it works: After clicking on a product tag from a brand partnering with Instagram, you\u2019ll see an option to \u201cCheckout on Instagram\u201d and you\u2019ll be able to select a color and size, if applicable. Then, you\u2019ll enter an email address, delivery information, and input credit card details or link a PayPal account, which Instagram will save for future orders. If you want, you can add a PIN for purchases to make your Instagram account more secure.\nAn Instagram spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that for now, users can only purchase one item at a time on Instagram, but the team is \u201cactively exploring ways\u201d to improve the experience, including adding a multi-item shopping cart. Currently, the experience is limited to mobile, and does not work on the desktop version of Instagram. Instagram plans to eventually expand the checkout beta test, which will run through the end of the year, to include more retailers. The spokesperson also said that posts with product tags are not given more visibility in users\u2019 feeds, and will be \u201ctreated like any other post.\u201d\nInstagram is charging the brands a selling fee (which it won\u2019t disclose) to cover services such as its purchase protection policy. That means if something you order through the app is damaged in transit, or is different than as described, and the merchant won\u2019t refund you, Instagram will issue a refund for the full purchase price and shipping costs.\nThe feature could potentially boost sales for smaller, independent brands or sellers in other marketplaces, like Etsy, who have protested increased transaction fees on the marketplaces where they sell. However, for now, Instagram checkout is aimed at larger, more established companies.\nInstagram has become increasingly important to the bottom line of its parent company Facebook. Some analysts expect Instagram to drive the majority of Facebook\u2019s ad revenue growth by 2020.\nThe move to develop a robust shopping experience signals the social network\u2019s interest in cashing in on purchases inspired by its content, but transacted elsewhere. Instagram has long been a sort of shopping bazaar for vintage pieces and other items of carefully curated clothing. The way the informal marketplace worked historically was low tech: Users could \u201cclaim\u201d items by commenting on a post with their PayPal-linked email first, or they could purchase the items through a link in the account\u2019s bio.\nSince then, Instagram has become a critical marketing tool for online-only, direct-to-consumer products, ranging from makeup to mattresses \u2014 and more people are buying from these brands. A recent RetailDive study found that 81% of Americans said that they\u2019ll make at least one purchase from a direct-to-consumer company in the next five years. The activewear outfitter Outdoor Voices, one of Instagram\u2019s first checkout partners, is one such brand that makes the majority of its sales online. This new checkout feature is just Instagram\u2019s latest effort to bring more shopping to the platform. Over the past year, the app has added shopping to stories, a channel dedicated to Shopping in the app\u2019s explore tab, and a new profile view showcasing only products from shopping posts.\nAnd with the added ability to check out on Instagram, the company can now collect data on not just what you\u2019re interested in, but what you actually spend your money on.\nThe full list of brands launching with Instagram\u2019s new checkout feature includes: Adidas, Anastasia Beverly Hills, Balmain, Burberry, ColourPop, Dior, Huda Beauty, H&M, KKW Beauty, MAC Cosmetics, Michael Kors, NARS, Nike, Oscar de la Renta, Outdoor Voices, Ouai Hair, Prada, Revolve, Uniqlo, Warby Parker, and Zara.",

Typically, last-minute amendments from the minority party are voted down, but 26 Democratic members voted with Republicans to pass the amendment.</p>\n<p>It was a rare and embarrassing loss for the Democratic majority and appeared to be unexpected, as party leaders huddled over what to do next. The party ended up voting for the bill to pass it despite the amendment.</p>\n<p>On Thursday the House voted 228-198 to close the so-called Charleston loophole that allows a gun sale to go through if a background check is not completed within three days. Three Republicans voted with Democrats. Taken together, these two pieces of legislation would be the most significant gun control reforms in many years.</p>\n<p>But the bills are expected to stall in the Senate. Senate Judiciary Committee chair Lindsey Graham has already said he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/26/senate-gun-control-bills-1186732\">will not hold hearings</a> on the background check legislation. President Trump has also said <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/c1f392e8f34541e0bad6a0195795a12e\">he would veto the bills</a> because they impose unreasonable requirements on gun owners.</p>\n<p>There have been several attempts to take up gun control in Congress in recent years as a string of shootings across the country, at <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/parkland\">schools</a>, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jimdalrympleii/shooting-erupts-in-downtown-charleston-south-carolina\">churches</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/badge/vegasshooting\">concerts</a>, focused public attention on the issue. Congress ultimately did not pass any new gun restrictions, but in 2018 did <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/trumps-gun-laws-strengthen-the-background-check-registry\">pass a bill</a> to improve data entry to the national background checks system.</p>\n<p>The House bill passed Wednesday would expand mandatory background checks to nearly all gun sales. Currently, federally licensed firearm dealers must perform background checks on a customer before selling a firearm, but about one in five gun sales are exempt from background checks. These are private sales, online sales from nonlicensed dealers, and sales at gun shows through what&rsquo;s known as the gun show loophole.</p>\n<p>The bill would expand background check requirements to most private sales, though firearm transfers between immediate family members would still be exempt.</p>\n<p>The bill to be voted on Thursday would give authorities more time to perform background checks. It is inspired by the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina, shooting where white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine people inside a black Methodist church.</p>\n<p>Roof had been arrested for possession of narcotics and should not have been able to purchase the .45-caliber handgun he used in the attack. But <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-comey-regarding-dylann-roof-gun-purchase\">the background check system was rife with data problems</a> and could not be immediately completed. After three days, the background check remained incomplete and the dealer transferred the gun to Roof, as is legally allowed.</p>\n<p>Federal laws still allow firearm dealers to adopt this &ldquo;default proceed&rdquo; policy, whereby the sale goes through if the background check is not completed within three days.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/2017-nics-operations-report.pdf/view\">FBI data</a> show that in 2017, 1 in 10 background checks were hit with a delay. There were 6,000 cases where investigators realized only after the three-day window that the buyer should have been rejected from purchasing a firearm. This includes over 1,000 successful gun sales to people convicted of domestic violence offenses, 500 gun sales to people who were fugitives, and 120 gun sales to people currently under a restraining order for domestic violence.</p>\n<p>While Graham is so far refusing to pick up either bill at the Senate Judiciary Committee, he has said the committee will study &ldquo;red flag&rdquo; laws that allow law enforcement to seize an individual&rsquo;s guns if they are deemed to be an imminent threat. Several states have passed red flag laws in recent years.</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The House of Representatives passed two bills this week that would vastly expand background checks, but they will likely be blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate and President Trump.\nOn Wednesday the House voted 240-190 to require background checks for private gun sales, with eight Republicans joining most Democrats to support it.\nBefore the vote, Republicans proposed an amendment to the bill to require Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials be notified any time an undocumented immigrant attempted to purchase a firearm. Typically, last-minute amendments from the minority party are voted down, but 26 Democratic members voted with Republicans to pass the amendment.\nIt was a rare and embarrassing loss for the Democratic majority and appeared to be unexpected, as party leaders huddled over what to do next. The party ended up voting for the bill to pass it despite the amendment.\nOn Thursday the House voted 228-198 to close the so-called Charleston loophole that allows a gun sale to go through if a background check is not completed within three days. Three Republicans voted with Democrats. Taken together, these two pieces of legislation would be the most significant gun control reforms in many years.\nBut the bills are expected to stall in the Senate. Senate Judiciary Committee chair Lindsey Graham has already said he will not hold hearings on the background check legislation. President Trump has also said he would veto the bills because they impose unreasonable requirements on gun owners.\nThere have been several attempts to take up gun control in Congress in recent years as a string of shootings across the country, at schools, churches, and concerts, focused public attention on the issue. Congress ultimately did not pass any new gun restrictions, but in 2018 did pass a bill to improve data entry to the national background checks system.\nThe House bill passed Wednesday would expand mandatory background checks to nearly all gun sales. Currently, federally licensed firearm dealers must perform background checks on a customer before selling a firearm, but about one in five gun sales are exempt from background checks. These are private sales, online sales from nonlicensed dealers, and sales at gun shows through what\u2019s known as the gun show loophole.\nThe bill would expand background check requirements to most private sales, though firearm transfers between immediate family members would still be exempt.\nThe bill to be voted on Thursday would give authorities more time to perform background checks. It is inspired by the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina, shooting where white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine people inside a black Methodist church.\nRoof had been arrested for possession of narcotics and should not have been able to purchase the .45-caliber handgun he used in the attack. But the background check system was rife with data problems and could not be immediately completed. After three days, the background check remained incomplete and the dealer transferred the gun to Roof, as is legally allowed.\nFederal laws still allow firearm dealers to adopt this \u201cdefault proceed\u201d policy, whereby the sale goes through if the background check is not completed within three days.\nFBI data show that in 2017, 1 in 10 background checks were hit with a delay. There were 6,000 cases where investigators realized only after the three-day window that the buyer should have been rejected from purchasing a firearm. This includes over 1,000 successful gun sales to people convicted of domestic violence offenses, 500 gun sales to people who were fugitives, and 120 gun sales to people currently under a restraining order for domestic violence.\nWhile Graham is so far refusing to pick up either bill at the Senate Judiciary Committee, he has said the committee will study \u201cred flag\u201d laws that allow law enforcement to seize an individual\u2019s guns if they are deemed to be an imminent threat. Several states have passed red flag laws in recent years.",

He and his attorney told BuzzFeed News they still have no idea why.</p>\n<p>The deportation caught Gonzalez Carranza by surprise. He&rsquo;d entered the US illegally when he was 15, but had been offered a reprieve and his immigration case was closed after his wife, Army Private First Class Barbara Vieyra, was killed during a tour in Afghanistan in 2010.</p>\n<p>But on April 8, Gonzalez Carranza was pulled over at 5 a.m. while on his way to work in Apache Junction by officers that he said were wearing bulletproof vests, helmets, and military gear.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I had seven or eight cops yelling at me and pointing guns at me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When they took me in, I asked them, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; and they said nothing, only that I have an order to be arrested.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until he arrived at a detention facility in Phoenix that he learned they were immigration officers. By April 10, Gonzalez Carranza had been deported and was in Nogales.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez Carranza stayed in Nogales the entire time, and although he had no idea when or if he&rsquo;d be allowed to return, he had no plans on leaving either.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t going to leave Nogales,&rdquo; Gonzalez Carranza&rsquo;s attorney, Ezequiel Hernandez, told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lived here his entire life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While in Mexico, the case was <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2019/04/15/ice-deports-gonzalez-spouse-u-s-soldier-killed-afghanistan/3477332002/\">reported by the Arizona Republic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/16/ice-deported-widow-soldier-killed-afghanistan-attorney-says/?utm_term=.5970942af944\">national news outlets</a>, drawing increased public attention to the widower of a US vet who had been separated from his daughter, a US citizen.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everything that they asked him to do, we did,&rdquo; Hernandez said. &ldquo;There was no reason for him to be deported.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Then on Monday, Hernandez said he got a call from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials who told him that if Gonzalez Carranza could make his way to the port of entry in Tucson, Arizona, they would allow him back into the US.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, ICE officials said Gonzalez Carranza was allowed to return to the US, &quot;pending adjudication of his immigration proceedings,&quot; but an agency spokesperson did not answer questions from BuzzFeed News on why the deportation decision was reversed.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, an immigration judge with the Executive Office for Immigration Review will determine if proceedings should be reopened, and whether Gonzalez-Carranza has legal basis to remain in the US, an ICE spokeswoman said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Originally from Veracruz, Mexico, Hernandez said Gonzalez Carranza&rsquo;s only trouble with the law was when he was pulled over for a DUI when he was 17 or 18 years old.</p>\n<figure>  <picture> <source media=\"(min-width: 52rem)\" srcset=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-04/16/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/sub-buzz-28396-1555456733-1.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto 1600w\"></source> <source srcset=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-04/16/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/sub-buzz-28396-1555456733-1.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto 800w\"></source> <img alt=\"\" data-bfa=\"@o:{ignore:[bfaBinder]};\" src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-04/16/19/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-05/sub-buzz-28396-1555456733-1.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&downsize=360:*\"></img> </picture>  <figcaption>Courtesy of Jose Gonzalez Carranza</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Then when he was 19, he <a href=\"http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/news/years-later-a-mesa-family-still-mourns-fallen-hero/article_47681e72-616a-11e8-9b17-2f502c0b2a53.html\">married Barbara Vieyra</a>, who gave birth to the couple&rsquo;s daughter before enlisting in the Army.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez Carranza said his late wife wanted a better life for her and her family, but on Sept. 18, 2010, she was killed when her unit was attacked near Kabul with IEDs and rocket-propelled grenades.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez Carranza was granted parole under a provision that allows undocumented relatives of military members to stay in the US. Hernandez said his client&rsquo;s deportation order was then canceled and his case closed.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez Carranza obtained a work permit for a job as a welder, sharing custody of his now 12-year-old daughter with his former in-laws.</p>\n<p>Hernandez said ICE later moved to have Gonzalez Carranza deported earlier this year, unbeknownst to his client.</p>\n<p>Hernandez said he does not know why the case was refiled, but that Gonzalez Carranza was never notified about an immigration hearing, where he was ordered removed.</p>\n<p>Hernandez said he believes it was the public attention that pushed US officials to reverse their decision; however, ICE has offered no explanation. He also doesn&rsquo;t know why his client was allowed back in.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t give us a why or anything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All I cared about at that time was for him to get back home.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "The husband of a US soldier killed in Afghanistan was deported last week until, just as his case began to catch national attention, immigration officials suddenly reversed their decision and allowed him back in.\n\u201cYou end up traumatized,\u201d Jose Gonzalez Carranza told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview Tuesday from Phoenix. \u201cYou end up in limbo.\u201d\nFor five days, Gonzalez Carranza stayed in Nogales, Mexico, as close to the border as he could so his cellphone could still pick up a signal and reach his attorney, not knowing if or when he\u2019d be able to get back to his 12-year-old daughter in Phoenix.\nThen, just as unexpectedly as he had been deported, the 30-year-old was allowed back into the US on Monday. He and his attorney told BuzzFeed News they still have no idea why.\nThe deportation caught Gonzalez Carranza by surprise. He\u2019d entered the US illegally when he was 15, but had been offered a reprieve and his immigration case was closed after his wife, Army Private First Class Barbara Vieyra, was killed during a tour in Afghanistan in 2010.\nBut on April 8, Gonzalez Carranza was pulled over at 5 a.m. while on his way to work in Apache Junction by officers that he said were wearing bulletproof vests, helmets, and military gear.\n\u201cI had seven or eight cops yelling at me and pointing guns at me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they took me in, I asked them, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 and they said nothing, only that I have an order to be arrested.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t until he arrived at a detention facility in Phoenix that he learned they were immigration officers. By April 10, Gonzalez Carranza had been deported and was in Nogales.\nGonzalez Carranza stayed in Nogales the entire time, and although he had no idea when or if he\u2019d be allowed to return, he had no plans on leaving either.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to leave Nogales,\u201d Gonzalez Carranza\u2019s attorney, Ezequiel Hernandez, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cHe\u2019s lived here his entire life.\u201d\nWhile in Mexico, the case was reported by the Arizona Republic and national news outlets, drawing increased public attention to the widower of a US vet who had been separated from his daughter, a US citizen.\n\u201cEverything that they asked him to do, we did,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThere was no reason for him to be deported.\u201d\nThen on Monday, Hernandez said he got a call from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials who told him that if Gonzalez Carranza could make his way to the port of entry in Tucson, Arizona, they would allow him back into the US.\nOn Tuesday, ICE officials said Gonzalez Carranza was allowed to return to the US, \"pending adjudication of his immigration proceedings,\" but an agency spokesperson did not answer questions from BuzzFeed News on why the deportation decision was reversed.\nMeanwhile, an immigration judge with the Executive Office for Immigration Review will determine if proceedings should be reopened, and whether Gonzalez-Carranza has legal basis to remain in the US, an ICE spokeswoman said in a statement.\nOriginally from Veracruz, Mexico, Hernandez said Gonzalez Carranza\u2019s only trouble with the law was when he was pulled over for a DUI when he was 17 or 18 years old.\nThen when he was 19, he married Barbara Vieyra, who gave birth to the couple\u2019s daughter before enlisting in the Army.\nGonzalez Carranza said his late wife wanted a better life for her and her family, but on Sept. 18, 2010, she was killed when her unit was attacked near Kabul with IEDs and rocket-propelled grenades.\nGonzalez Carranza was granted parole under a provision that allows undocumented relatives of military members to stay in the US. Hernandez said his client\u2019s deportation order was then canceled and his case closed.\nGonzalez Carranza obtained a work permit for a job as a welder, sharing custody of his now 12-year-old daughter with his former in-laws.\nHernandez said ICE later moved to have Gonzalez Carranza deported earlier this year, unbeknownst to his client.\nHernandez said he does not know why the case was refiled, but that Gonzalez Carranza was never notified about an immigration hearing, where he was ordered removed.\nHernandez said he believes it was the public attention that pushed US officials to reverse their decision; however, ICE has offered no explanation. He also doesn\u2019t know why his client was allowed back in.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t give us a why or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I cared about at that time was for him to get back home.\u201d",

Within minutes, parishioners and tourists emptied the cathedral, leaving just staff behind.\nWhen he left the building about 20 minutes later, Vexo said there was still no evidence of a fire, adding that he thought it was a false alarm.\nMonsignor Patrick Chauvet, the rector of Notre Dame, told French radio station France Inter that the cathedral has fire supervisors who go up to the attic to examine the frame three times a day.\n\"In terms of security, I doubt we could have done more,\" Chauvet said.\nHeitz said there were no indications that the blaze was started deliberately. Investigators plan to interview representatives from the companies that were renovating the structure at the time of the fire.\nMeanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to rebuild the cathedral as billionaires and corporations step forward to pledge financial donations to support that effort.",

                "text": "Danielle Cohn, 15, amassed armies of both fans and haters when she became one of the most popular Musical.ly stars before the app was folded into TikTok.\nCohn has since translated her following into a successful YouTube account (1.2 million subscribers) and even bigger Instagram account (3.5 million followers).\nThe young social media influencer has now drawn droves of heated reactions after she led fans to believe she was married to her 16-year-old boyfriend Mikey Tua \u2014 and was pregnant with his child.\nIn a monetized YouTube video posted over the weekend, Cohn and Tua filmed themselves in a wedding ceremony officiated by an Elvis impersonator and claimed throughout that they were in Vegas \u201cto get married.\u201d The video already has over 2.5 million views.\nIn Nevada, anyone under the age of 16 needs a court order authorizing a marriage license to be issued. According to online court records for Las Vegas, no marriage license has been issued for Cohn or Tua.\nDays earlier, Cohn created pregnancy rumors after she posted a cryptic photo showing Tua kissing her stomach. The photo was followed by a tweet from Tua that read, \u201cExpecting 08/14/19 #manibaby.\u201d She followed it with a tweet of her own with the same date.\nCohn\u2019s mother, Jennifer, who also manages her accounts and career, told BuzzFeed News her daughter did not actually legally marry Tua. \u201cIt was a YouTube video like most YouTube people do for clickbait,\u201d she said.\n\u201cShe committed to her best friend in Vegas ... legally they can\u2019t get married,\u201d Jennifer said.\nJennifer did not address claims that her daughter is pregnant and did not immediately respond to multiple inquiries from BuzzFeed News about the subject.\nCohn\u2019s mom also categorically denied that the marriage claims were \u201cdone for a stunt,\u201d stating that the two teens \u201care YouTubers [who] did something ... they made a promise.\u201d\nAround the same time Cohn published her marriage video, Tua dropped a YouTube video titled \u201cWe Are Expecting...\u201d where they filmed themselves sharing news of a pregnancy with friends and family. His video has over 3.1 million views currently. At no point in the video do they reveal whether or not they\u2019re serious.\nPeople online did not interpret the whole situation as just YouTube fodder \u2014 they were distressed.\nMany commenters said the young couple are inadequate \u201crole models\u201d and aren\u2019t examples of how maturity and relationships should be seen.\nSome worried that equally young, if not younger, followers will be inspired by their actions \u2014 whether the ceremony was faked or not.\n\u201cGirl you are a CHILD TF YOU DOIN,\u201d a fan tweeted.\nSome couldn\u2019t help but make jokes about the marriage and/or pregnancy that they believed to be true.\n\u201c*Dr.phill has joined the chat*,\u201d a top comment read.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be doing your homework,\u201d another said.\nA majority of the comments took the rumors seriously. \u201cOpen the Bible not your legs,\u201d someone wrote.\nSome comments took their criticisms too far and harassed the couple.\nAmong a list of \u201cthings danielle cohn should have done,\u201d one user wrote, \u201cbeen aborted.\u201d\nJennifer told BuzzFeed News that she finds it \u201cpretty sad that this has become such a huge deal\u201d in response to the range of backlash her daughter is receiving.\n\u201cPeople prank and do all kinds of stuff on the internet,\u201d she added.\nMany people \u2014 at least on social media and who are observing the actions of social media\u2013famous subjects \u2014 were not amused.",

Approximately 170 donors gave more than $200 to both Harris&rsquo;s and Pete Buttigieg&rsquo;s campaigns, and roughly 166 gave to both Cory Booker&rsquo;s and Harris&rsquo;s campaigns, according to a BuzzFeed News analysis of the latest presidential fundraising numbers, which were filed with the Federal Election Commission on Monday and cover the first three months of this year.</p>\n<p>The data, along with interviews with some of the donors, reflects an engaged Democratic base that is keeping an early and close eye on the 2020 race, and suggests that voters are not too concerned about a drawn-out primary.</p>\n<p>There was also significant overlap between donors who gave to both Beto O&rsquo;Rourke and Buttigieg and those who gave to both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, according to the analysis.</p>\n<p>And although Sanders had the largest number of disclosed donors in the first quarter, only roughly 300 of them overlapped with any other campaign. That&rsquo;s about the same number as Booker, who reported one-third as many donors.</p>\n<p>The data and analysis do not include the smallest-dollar donors; campaigns are not required to report contributors who have given a total of $200 or less. And because Joe Biden is not yet a declared presidential candidate and has not officially raised any money, he wasn&rsquo;t included in the analysis. (For the data, code, and methodology supporting the analysis, <a href=\"https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2019-04-democratic-candidate-codonors\">click here</a>.)</p>\n<p>Approximately 44 donors gave to the campaigns of three or more women candidates in an election cycle that has seen the most diverse presidential field in history.</p>\n<p>Ellen Burns of Wellesley, Massachusetts, gave to four women &mdash; Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, Harris, and Warren &mdash; even though she already has a favorite.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all in on Kirsten Gillibrand. I think she has the potential to go toe-to-toe with [President Donald] Trump in a way that will be effective,&rdquo; Burns said, adding that she still wants American voters to get used to hearing from more women candidates. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little disappointed that the female candidates are just not getting the support they deserve.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Some crossover donors were eager to see several candidates make it to at least the debate stage this summer. Candidates need to meet a donor threshold to qualify for the debates.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I want to make sure we have people on the debate stage who have good ideas and that they aren&rsquo;t drowned out by the same people who have been around,&rdquo; said Jonathan Dana, a Washington, DC&ndash;based lawyer, who has given to Jay Inslee, Klobuchar, Gillibrand, and Buttigieg.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too early right now to have a robust debate and see someone who is very young like Mayor Pete compete with someone like Biden.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dana said he supported Sanders in 2016, but now he believes the party needs a new voice. &ldquo;His time has come and gone, but yet, he&rsquo;s sucking up a lot of the money.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With nearly 10 months to go before the Iowa caucuses, donors said they were in no rush to whittle down the expanding Democratic field.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think they are all credible candidates,&rdquo; said Robert Brady of Riverside, Connecticut, who has given to four candidates so far: Warren, Harris, Buttigieg, and Gillibrand.</p>\n<p>Brady said he has different reasons for supporting each of the four, but overall, believes their values line up with his.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They are all smart, principled people, and they stand up for their values &mdash; every one of them,&rdquo; Brady said. &ldquo;The general election campaign is going to be brutal and is going to require somebody of inordinate toughness to stand up to the shouting and screaming, and they all have that resilience.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Brady is one of roughly 270 donors who gave more than $200 to three or more Democratic candidates between January and March. About a dozen of those donors have given to five or more candidates. They include Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes and his husband Sean Eldridge, a former House candidate and now a political activist; Hollywood producer Andrew Mellett; and entrepreneur Pedro Torres-Mackie.</p>\n<p>Sara Garcia, a California-based lawyer, gave $500 each to Harris, Warren, and Buttigieg in the first quarter. &ldquo;The batch of candidates varies so greatly in their backgrounds, life experiences and level political office experience,&rdquo; Garcia said. &ldquo;Diversity is our strength as a party, and I want to see the best woman or man for the job get the nomination, which to me means hearing from everyone. So I support multiple candidates to do my small part to contribute to their resources to get their message heard.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Many of the donors who have given to multiple campaigns have also not yet reached the maximum contribution of $2,800 for each of the candidates they are supporting. And some said they were still debating backing more candidates.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t finished writing checks,&rdquo; Brady said, &ldquo;I don't think.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside data-bfa=\"@l:Related-Links\"> <h2>More on the 2020 campaign</h2>  </aside>",

                "text": "About 1,600 donors have given more than $200 to multiple Democratic presidential candidates this year, with the largest overlap existing among donors who gave to both Kamala Harris and at least one other campaign.\nIn all, more than 700 donors gave to Harris\u2019s campaign and at least one other. Approximately 170 donors gave more than $200 to both Harris\u2019s and Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaigns, and roughly 166 gave to both Cory Booker\u2019s and Harris\u2019s campaigns, according to a BuzzFeed News analysis of the latest presidential fundraising numbers, which were filed with the Federal Election Commission on Monday and cover the first three months of this year.\nThe data, along with interviews with some of the donors, reflects an engaged Democratic base that is keeping an early and close eye on the 2020 race, and suggests that voters are not too concerned about a drawn-out primary.\nThere was also significant overlap between donors who gave to both Beto O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg and those who gave to both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, according to the analysis.\nAnd although Sanders had the largest number of disclosed donors in the first quarter, only roughly 300 of them overlapped with any other campaign. That\u2019s about the same number as Booker, who reported one-third as many donors.\nThe data and analysis do not include the smallest-dollar donors; campaigns are not required to report contributors who have given a total of $200 or less. And because Joe Biden is not yet a declared presidential candidate and has not officially raised any money, he wasn\u2019t included in the analysis. (For the data, code, and methodology supporting the analysis, click here.)\nApproximately 44 donors gave to the campaigns of three or more women candidates in an election cycle that has seen the most diverse presidential field in history.\nEllen Burns of Wellesley, Massachusetts, gave to four women \u2014 Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, Harris, and Warren \u2014 even though she already has a favorite.\n\u201cI\u2019m all in on Kirsten Gillibrand. I think she has the potential to go toe-to-toe with [President Donald] Trump in a way that will be effective,\u201d Burns said, adding that she still wants American voters to get used to hearing from more women candidates. \u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed that the female candidates are just not getting the support they deserve.\u201d\nSome crossover donors were eager to see several candidates make it to at least the debate stage this summer. Candidates need to meet a donor threshold to qualify for the debates.\n\u201cI want to make sure we have people on the debate stage who have good ideas and that they aren\u2019t drowned out by the same people who have been around,\u201d said Jonathan Dana, a Washington, DC\u2013based lawyer, who has given to Jay Inslee, Klobuchar, Gillibrand, and Buttigieg.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too early right now to have a robust debate and see someone who is very young like Mayor Pete compete with someone like Biden.\u201d\nDana said he supported Sanders in 2016, but now he believes the party needs a new voice. \u201cHis time has come and gone, but yet, he\u2019s sucking up a lot of the money.\u201d\nWith nearly 10 months to go before the Iowa caucuses, donors said they were in no rush to whittle down the expanding Democratic field.\n\u201cI think they are all credible candidates,\u201d said Robert Brady of Riverside, Connecticut, who has given to four candidates so far: Warren, Harris, Buttigieg, and Gillibrand.\nBrady said he has different reasons for supporting each of the four, but overall, believes their values line up with his.\n\u201cThey are all smart, principled people, and they stand up for their values \u2014 every one of them,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe general election campaign is going to be brutal and is going to require somebody of inordinate toughness to stand up to the shouting and screaming, and they all have that resilience.\u201d\nBrady is one of roughly 270 donors who gave more than $200 to three or more Democratic candidates between January and March. About a dozen of those donors have given to five or more candidates. They include Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes and his husband Sean Eldridge, a former House candidate and now a political activist; Hollywood producer Andrew Mellett; and entrepreneur Pedro Torres-Mackie.\nSara Garcia, a California-based lawyer, gave $500 each to Harris, Warren, and Buttigieg in the first quarter. \u201cThe batch of candidates varies so greatly in their backgrounds, life experiences and level political office experience,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cDiversity is our strength as a party, and I want to see the best woman or man for the job get the nomination, which to me means hearing from everyone. So I support multiple candidates to do my small part to contribute to their resources to get their message heard.\u201d\nMany of the donors who have given to multiple campaigns have also not yet reached the maximum contribution of $2,800 for each of the candidates they are supporting. And some said they were still debating backing more candidates.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t finished writing checks,\u201d Brady said, \u201cI don't think.\u201d\nMore on the 2020 campaign",

The three-judge panel unanimously upheld a lower court judge&rsquo;s order finding Miller in civil contempt, a ruling that could put him behind bars if he still refuses to testify.</p>\n<p>In an opinion written by Judge Judith Rogers, the court concluded that Mueller was an &ldquo;inferior officer,&rdquo; which meant he could be legally appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein; Rosenstein appointed Mueller to run the Russia investigation in May 2017. Miller had argued that Mueller was a &ldquo;principal officer&rdquo; who had to be confirmed by the US Senate.</p>\n<p>Rogers wrote that an official in Mueller&rsquo;s position didn&rsquo;t hold enough power on his own to qualify as a &ldquo;principal officer.&rdquo; The attorney general &mdash; or Rosenstein, who was overseeing Mueller&rsquo;s work until recently in light of former attorney general Jeff Sessions&rsquo; recusal from the Russia probe &mdash; could withdraw the regulations that gave Mueller what authority he did have, and that dictated the conditions for when Mueller could be removed, the court noted.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In either event, Special Counsel Mueller effectively serves at the pleasure of an Executive Branch officer who was appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate,&rdquo; Rogers wrote.</p>\n<p>Miller could petition the entire DC Circuit to reconsider his case, or he could petition the US Supreme Court. If Tuesday&rsquo;s opinion stands, Miller will be jailed if he continues to refuse to comply with the grand jury subpoena. His lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the special counsel&rsquo;s office declined to comment.</p>\n<p>The DC Circuit <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/robert-mueller-special-counsel-challenge-miller\">heard arguments</a> in early November. Amid reports this month that the special counsel&rsquo;s office was finishing up its work, the fact that Miller&rsquo;s case and his legal challenge to Mueller&rsquo;s appointment were pending raised questions about how much work prosecutors on Mueller&rsquo;s team had left to do, especially now that they&rsquo;ve filed charges against Roger Stone.</p>\n<p>During arguments, special counsel lawyer Michael Dreeben insisted that there were limits to Mueller&rsquo;s power, pointing to rules that required him to submit &ldquo;urgent reports&rdquo; on major events in the investigation and the fact that whatever official was in charge of the investigation &mdash; currently newly confirmed Attorney General Bill Barr &mdash; could intervene if Mueller was going to do something &ldquo;inappropriate or unwarranted.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mueller isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;off wandering in some free-floating environment,&rdquo; Dreeben said at the time.</p>\n<p>Miller was subpoenaed last summer to testify before the grand jury. US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell found him in contempt in August when he refused to do so, and Miller appealed. Howell <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4852426/8-10-18-Miller-Contempt-Order.pdf\">ordered</a> him jailed until he testifies, but the order was put on hold for as long as he was pursuing an appeal.</p>\n<p>The DC Circuit rejected Miller&rsquo;s other arguments against Mueller&rsquo;s appointment, finding that the US Supreme Court had held that Congress gave the attorney general power to appoint a special counsel. The court also found that Rosenstein was properly serving as acting attorney general and therefore had the power to appoint Mueller, since Sessions&rsquo; recusal was a &ldquo;disability&rdquo; that created a vacancy Rosenstein could fill.</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that special counsel Robert Mueller was \u201cproperly appointed,\u201d becoming the first higher court to weigh in on the lawfulness of Mueller\u2019s appointment and come out in his favor.\nThe US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit rejected arguments challenging Mueller\u2019s appointment raised by former Roger Stone associate Andrew Miller, who had refused to comply with a grand jury subpoena last year. The three-judge panel unanimously upheld a lower court judge\u2019s order finding Miller in civil contempt, a ruling that could put him behind bars if he still refuses to testify.\nIn an opinion written by Judge Judith Rogers, the court concluded that Mueller was an \u201cinferior officer,\u201d which meant he could be legally appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein; Rosenstein appointed Mueller to run the Russia investigation in May 2017. Miller had argued that Mueller was a \u201cprincipal officer\u201d who had to be confirmed by the US Senate.\nRogers wrote that an official in Mueller\u2019s position didn\u2019t hold enough power on his own to qualify as a \u201cprincipal officer.\u201d The attorney general \u2014 or Rosenstein, who was overseeing Mueller\u2019s work until recently in light of former attorney general Jeff Sessions\u2019 recusal from the Russia probe \u2014 could withdraw the regulations that gave Mueller what authority he did have, and that dictated the conditions for when Mueller could be removed, the court noted.\n\u201cIn either event, Special Counsel Mueller effectively serves at the pleasure of an Executive Branch officer who was appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate,\u201d Rogers wrote.\nMiller could petition the entire DC Circuit to reconsider his case, or he could petition the US Supreme Court. If Tuesday\u2019s opinion stands, Miller will be jailed if he continues to refuse to comply with the grand jury subpoena. His lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment.\nA spokesperson for the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment.\nThe DC Circuit heard arguments in early November. Amid reports this month that the special counsel\u2019s office was finishing up its work, the fact that Miller\u2019s case and his legal challenge to Mueller\u2019s appointment were pending raised questions about how much work prosecutors on Mueller\u2019s team had left to do, especially now that they\u2019ve filed charges against Roger Stone.\nDuring arguments, special counsel lawyer Michael Dreeben insisted that there were limits to Mueller\u2019s power, pointing to rules that required him to submit \u201curgent reports\u201d on major events in the investigation and the fact that whatever official was in charge of the investigation \u2014 currently newly confirmed Attorney General Bill Barr \u2014 could intervene if Mueller was going to do something \u201cinappropriate or unwarranted.\u201d\nMueller isn\u2019t \u201coff wandering in some free-floating environment,\u201d Dreeben said at the time.\nMiller was subpoenaed last summer to testify before the grand jury. US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell found him in contempt in August when he refused to do so, and Miller appealed. Howell ordered him jailed until he testifies, but the order was put on hold for as long as he was pursuing an appeal.\nThe DC Circuit rejected Miller\u2019s other arguments against Mueller\u2019s appointment, finding that the US Supreme Court had held that Congress gave the attorney general power to appoint a special counsel. The court also found that Rosenstein was properly serving as acting attorney general and therefore had the power to appoint Mueller, since Sessions\u2019 recusal was a \u201cdisability\u201d that created a vacancy Rosenstein could fill.",

To date, a federal judge in Maryland has repeatedly ruled against Trump.</p>\n<p>But the three-judge 4th Circuit panel expressed deep skepticism Tuesday about DC's and Maryland's positions on a host of issues, including what exactly they wanted a judge to order Trump to do, whether claims that Trump's hotel had an unfair competitive advantage were too speculative, and whether DC and Maryland &mdash; or anyone, for that matter &mdash; could bring a lawsuit against a president under the emoluments clauses.</p>\n<p>The attorney general offices in DC and Maryland sued Trump in June 2017, arguing that when foreign, state, or local officials patronize Trump&rsquo;s businesses, the president profits and receives a prohibited &ldquo;emolument.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;emolument&rdquo; is generally defined as a financial benefit, but the definition is one of the major issues in dispute. The judge in Maryland, US District Judge Peter Messitte, agreed with DC and Maryland&rsquo;s broad interpretation, and rejected the Justice Department&rsquo;s position that it should only cover money that a public official received in exchange for official acts or an employer/employee arrangement.</p>\n<p>The 4th Circuit &mdash; which is based in Richmond, Virginia, but covers federal courts in Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, and West &mdash; could order the case dismissed entirely, but there are other possible outcomes that would still represent a win for Trump. At a minimum, the Justice Department is arguing the 4th Circuit should allow an appeal to go forward on earlier rulings from Messitte, which would delay DC's and Maryland's efforts to pursue <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/dc-maryland-subpoena-trump-organization-dc-hotel\">dozens of subpoenas</a> they've issued against Trump's businesses. Messitte declined to give approval for an appeal at this stage, and allowed the subpoenas to go out.</p>\n<p>Justice Department attorney Hashim Mooppan focused his arguments Tuesday on urging the court to toss the case outright, arguing there was no legal authority for anyone to sue the president under the emoluments clauses.</p>\n<p>If no one could sue the president for accepting prohibited emoluments, Judge Dennis Shedd asked: &quot;Where's the check on the president?&quot; Mooppan replied that any sort of action against the president at least had to be authorized by Congress, and that had not happened. Mooppan also argued that the president presented a special situation, and left open the question of whether someone could file this type of lawsuit against a lower-ranking public official.</p>\n<p>Loren AliKhan, DC's solicitor general, argued first for DC and Maryland. Judge Paul Niemeyer pressed AliKhan to explain what official action by Trump was at issue. He said Trump had scaled back his involvement in his business empire and turned over management to his sons and asked if that meant Trump was only passively holding the financial interests at issue. AliKhan replied that Trump made a decision to keep his business holdings, which offered a way for foreign governments to offer emoluments and for the president to accept them.</p>\n<p>Shedd and Niemeyer grew frustrated that AliKhan would not provide a definite answer on what type of injunction they wanted a judge to impose on Trump &mdash; AliKhan said that an order requiring him to divest in the hotel would be one possible outcome, but it was too early to say what would be appropriate, and they wanted to leave it up to the lower court judge.</p>\n<p>Shedd and Niemeyer asked if having Trump put his assets in a blind trust would be appropriate, and when AliKhan replied that it could be, the two judges pushed back, questioning how it could satisfy DC and Maryland if Trump were still getting any profit from his businesses.</p>\n<p>&quot;You seem to be ducking the question,&quot; Niemeyer said.</p>\n<p>AliKhan said DC and Maryland would also be satisfied with a declaration from a judge saying that the president was in violation of the clauses, leaving it open how exactly he could come into compliance. Shedd mused whether such a declaration would be grounds for impeachment.</p>\n<p>The judges questioned the broad interpretation of &quot;emolument&quot; adopted by DC and Maryland. Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr. asked if a public official who had a bank account insured by the US government would violate the emoluments clauses, since they were receiving a benefit in the form of protected assets. Shedd posed the same question about an official who held US Treasury bills. AliKhan said the emoluments clauses covered profits and advantages, not financial instruments where an official didn't exercise discretion over the benefits they received.</p>\n<p>AliKhan said it crossed the line when the president received profits and actively solicited business from foreign governments. Shedd asked if DC and Maryland's interpretation would only protect career politicians. AliKhan replied that public officials who come in with certain types of assets were generally instructed to place them into a blind trust, which prompted a whole new round of questions from the judges about how a blind trust would satisfy DC and Maryland.</p>\n<p>Shedd asked if a court could order that no person associated with a foreign government could stay at a Trump property. AliKhan said it would depend on the wording. Shedd then wondered if that scenario was similar to Trump's executive actions banning people from certain countries &mdash; predominantly majority-Muslim nations &mdash; from coming to the United States. Shedd asked: If Trump said no foreigners could stay at his hotel, how quickly would Maryland sue for discrimination? AliKhan replied that the case wasn't about foreigners but about foreign governments.</p>\n<p>The court heard arguments first on DC's and Maryland's claims against Trump in his official capacity as president. The lawsuit was later updated to add a claim against Trump in his individual capacity, but DC and Maryland decided not to press it. However, Trump's personal lawyers were in court Tuesday to argue that the 4th Circuit should issue an order barring DC and Maryland from trying to sue Trump individually in the future. William Consovoy, Trump's personal attorney, argued that the president on an individual basis should be completely immune from this sort of lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Niemeyer questioned whether the court should get into the substance of Consovoy's arguments at all if DC and Maryland were dropping the claim. However, the judges got into a tense back-and-forth with Maryland Assistant Attorney General Leah Tulin about whether there was a chance DC and Maryland might try to sue Trump individually in the future. Tulin said they did not plan on it, but she argued they weren't required to commit to never bringing it again.</p>\n<p>Shedd said Trump probably felt there was a risk that he would be sued personally in the future, which Shedd said he understood and asked Tulin why DC and Maryland wouldn't take it off the table. Tulin repeated that there was no requirement under the rules, and that the judge was asking her to answer a question about internal litigation strategy.</p>\n<p>Tulin said that if DC and Maryland tried to bring individual claims against Trump in the future, Trump could raise various challenges that a judge would have to address first. Shedd, who throughout the hearing questioned how Messitte had handled the case and whether he'd tried to dictate how DC and Maryland pursued it, said to Consovoy, &quot;You don't think you would win.&quot; Consovoy replied that he was an optimist.</p>\n<p>Consovoy argued that DC and Maryland's claims &mdash; that Trump's hotel had an unfair advantage and hurt other local hotels and venues &mdash; were too speculative. In response, Shedd wondered whether the fact that Trump inspired so many protests against him in DC had, in fact, helped other hotels in the region. It wasn't speculation to say that people coming to protest Trump weren't booking rooms at Trump's hotel, the judge quipped.</p>\n<p>At the end of arguments, as is tradition in the 4th Circuit, the judges came down from the bench to shake hands with the lawyers. As Shedd shook Tulin's hand, he asked, &quot;Was it fun?&quot; He then laughed and answered his own question for her: &quot;Not so much!&quot;</p>",

                "text": "RICHMOND, Virginia \u2014 President Donald Trump's personal lawyers and attorneys from the Justice Department argued Tuesday that no one should be able to sue Trump for profiting from his businesses while he's in office \u2014 and for the first time in more than a year, things went well for the president in the case.\nThe US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit heard arguments in a lawsuit brought by Maryland and the District of Columbia accusing Trump of violating the foreign and domestic emoluments clauses of the US Constitution by refusing to give up his interest in the Trump International Hotel in Washington. To date, a federal judge in Maryland has repeatedly ruled against Trump.\nBut the three-judge 4th Circuit panel expressed deep skepticism Tuesday about DC's and Maryland's positions on a host of issues, including what exactly they wanted a judge to order Trump to do, whether claims that Trump's hotel had an unfair competitive advantage were too speculative, and whether DC and Maryland \u2014 or anyone, for that matter \u2014 could bring a lawsuit against a president under the emoluments clauses.\nThe attorney general offices in DC and Maryland sued Trump in June 2017, arguing that when foreign, state, or local officials patronize Trump\u2019s businesses, the president profits and receives a prohibited \u201cemolument.\u201d The word \u201cemolument\u201d is generally defined as a financial benefit, but the definition is one of the major issues in dispute. The judge in Maryland, US District Judge Peter Messitte, agreed with DC and Maryland\u2019s broad interpretation, and rejected the Justice Department\u2019s position that it should only cover money that a public official received in exchange for official acts or an employer/employee arrangement.\nThe 4th Circuit \u2014 which is based in Richmond, Virginia, but covers federal courts in Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, and West \u2014 could order the case dismissed entirely, but there are other possible outcomes that would still represent a win for Trump. At a minimum, the Justice Department is arguing the 4th Circuit should allow an appeal to go forward on earlier rulings from Messitte, which would delay DC's and Maryland's efforts to pursue dozens of subpoenas they've issued against Trump's businesses. Messitte declined to give approval for an appeal at this stage, and allowed the subpoenas to go out.\nJustice Department attorney Hashim Mooppan focused his arguments Tuesday on urging the court to toss the case outright, arguing there was no legal authority for anyone to sue the president under the emoluments clauses.\nIf no one could sue the president for accepting prohibited emoluments, Judge Dennis Shedd asked: \"Where's the check on the president?\" Mooppan replied that any sort of action against the president at least had to be authorized by Congress, and that had not happened. Mooppan also argued that the president presented a special situation, and left open the question of whether someone could file this type of lawsuit against a lower-ranking public official.\nLoren AliKhan, DC's solicitor general, argued first for DC and Maryland. Judge Paul Niemeyer pressed AliKhan to explain what official action by Trump was at issue. He said Trump had scaled back his involvement in his business empire and turned over management to his sons and asked if that meant Trump was only passively holding the financial interests at issue. AliKhan replied that Trump made a decision to keep his business holdings, which offered a way for foreign governments to offer emoluments and for the president to accept them.\nShedd and Niemeyer grew frustrated that AliKhan would not provide a definite answer on what type of injunction they wanted a judge to impose on Trump \u2014 AliKhan said that an order requiring him to divest in the hotel would be one possible outcome, but it was too early to say what would be appropriate, and they wanted to leave it up to the lower court judge.\nShedd and Niemeyer asked if having Trump put his assets in a blind trust would be appropriate, and when AliKhan replied that it could be, the two judges pushed back, questioning how it could satisfy DC and Maryland if Trump were still getting any profit from his businesses.\n\"You seem to be ducking the question,\" Niemeyer said.\nAliKhan said DC and Maryland would also be satisfied with a declaration from a judge saying that the president was in violation of the clauses, leaving it open how exactly he could come into compliance. Shedd mused whether such a declaration would be grounds for impeachment.\nThe judges questioned the broad interpretation of \"emolument\" adopted by DC and Maryland. Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr. asked if a public official who had a bank account insured by the US government would violate the emoluments clauses, since they were receiving a benefit in the form of protected assets. Shedd posed the same question about an official who held US Treasury bills. AliKhan said the emoluments clauses covered profits and advantages, not financial instruments where an official didn't exercise discretion over the benefits they received.\nAliKhan said it crossed the line when the president received profits and actively solicited business from foreign governments. Shedd asked if DC and Maryland's interpretation would only protect career politicians. AliKhan replied that public officials who come in with certain types of assets were generally instructed to place them into a blind trust, which prompted a whole new round of questions from the judges about how a blind trust would satisfy DC and Maryland.\nShedd asked if a court could order that no person associated with a foreign government could stay at a Trump property. AliKhan said it would depend on the wording. Shedd then wondered if that scenario was similar to Trump's executive actions banning people from certain countries \u2014 predominantly majority-Muslim nations \u2014 from coming to the United States. Shedd asked: If Trump said no foreigners could stay at his hotel, how quickly would Maryland sue for discrimination? AliKhan replied that the case wasn't about foreigners but about foreign governments.\nThe court heard arguments first on DC's and Maryland's claims against Trump in his official capacity as president. The lawsuit was later updated to add a claim against Trump in his individual capacity, but DC and Maryland decided not to press it. However, Trump's personal lawyers were in court Tuesday to argue that the 4th Circuit should issue an order barring DC and Maryland from trying to sue Trump individually in the future. William Consovoy, Trump's personal attorney, argued that the president on an individual basis should be completely immune from this sort of lawsuit.\nNiemeyer questioned whether the court should get into the substance of Consovoy's arguments at all if DC and Maryland were dropping the claim. However, the judges got into a tense back-and-forth with Maryland Assistant Attorney General Leah Tulin about whether there was a chance DC and Maryland might try to sue Trump individually in the future. Tulin said they did not plan on it, but she argued they weren't required to commit to never bringing it again.\nShedd said Trump probably felt there was a risk that he would be sued personally in the future, which Shedd said he understood and asked Tulin why DC and Maryland wouldn't take it off the table. Tulin repeated that there was no requirement under the rules, and that the judge was asking her to answer a question about internal litigation strategy.\nTulin said that if DC and Maryland tried to bring individual claims against Trump in the future, Trump could raise various challenges that a judge would have to address first. Shedd, who throughout the hearing questioned how Messitte had handled the case and whether he'd tried to dictate how DC and Maryland pursued it, said to Consovoy, \"You don't think you would win.\" Consovoy replied that he was an optimist.\nConsovoy argued that DC and Maryland's claims \u2014 that Trump's hotel had an unfair advantage and hurt other local hotels and venues \u2014 were too speculative. In response, Shedd wondered whether the fact that Trump inspired so many protests against him in DC had, in fact, helped other hotels in the region. It wasn't speculation to say that people coming to protest Trump weren't booking rooms at Trump's hotel, the judge quipped.\nAt the end of arguments, as is tradition in the 4th Circuit, the judges came down from the bench to shake hands with the lawyers. As Shedd shook Tulin's hand, he asked, \"Was it fun?\" He then laughed and answered his own question for her: \"Not so much!\"",

Kevin McAleenan says in the interview airing Sunday that he regrets the way the policy was carried out.\n\"The enforcement of the law against parents who violated our border laws and brought children with them was effective,\" Kevin McAleenan tells correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, \"It reduced the flow, but it didn't work in the sense that we lost the public trust in the implementation of that initiative.\nPresident Trump named McAleenan as acting head of the department following the resignation of Kirstjen Nielsen. McAleenan was the former head of Customs and Border Protection.\nIn the 60 Minutes report, Alfonsi shows border patrol stations overwhelmed with families the secretary says DHS is trying to house.\n\"We just had a bipartisan report from the Homeland Security Advisory Council that looked at the situation we're facing on the border and said, 'You need additional facilities,'\" McAleenan tells Alfonsi. \"You need to be able to take families and children out of a Border Patrol station, which is a police station, it's built for single adults who have violated laws. And you need them in a better setting.\"\nAlfonsi said in an interview with the CBS Evening News that tent cities will be utilized to house families.\n\"We have learned that DHS actually did start building two tent cities along the border in Texas,\" Alfonsi said. \"And we're told that they're supposed to be completed next week.\"\nThe full 60 Minutes report airs Sunday, April 28 at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.",

He was very charismatic,&quot; former local reporter Liz Dykes said. Dykes interviewed the 90-year-old former engineer about his time in World War II, his missionary work in Haiti, and most of all, his huge collection of artifacts from around the world.</p>\n<p>&quot;The entire house is a museum. There are things everywhere,&quot; Dykes recounted. &quot;It was just mind-blowing.&quot;</p>\n<p>Miller willingly showed his collection to reporters, residents, and even local Boy Scout troops, so when the FBI came calling, she said, &quot;I wanted to know what they were looking for... There had to have been something.&quot;</p>\n<p>There was: something the FBI hasn't talked about&mdash;until now.<br>\n&quot;When I first went into his house and saw the size of the collection, it was unlike anything we'd ever seen,&quot; Tim Carpenter, who heads the FBI's art crime unit, told CBS News correspondent Anna Werner. &quot;Not only me, but I don't think anybody on the art crime team.&quot;</p>\n<p>FBI photos &ndash; never before shown publicly &ndash; give a glimpse of the collection: some 42,000 items, including pre-Colombian pottery, an Italian mosaic, and items from China, some that Miller labeled &quot;Chinese Jewelry&quot; from 500 BC.</p>\n<p>&quot;Roughly half of the collection was Native American, and the other half of the collection was from every corner of the globe,&quot; Carpenter said.</p>\n<p>But the problem? Carpenter said a lot of it had been illegally obtained. Miller admitted he'd gone on digging expeditions in foreign countries and around the United States for decades in violation of antiquities laws.<br>\n&quot;Did he understand that he had obtained some things illegally?&quot; Werner asked.</p>\n<p>&quot;He did,&quot; Carpenter said, adding that Miller admitted to it.</p>\n<figure data-ads=\"{\"extraWordCount\":50}\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/02/26/e2760168-9f41-4e58-b6f8-01f49904d77b/resize/620x/7db34bab6ff069bb5ed25cbc6383428a/miller-2.png\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/02/26/e2760168-9f41-4e58-b6f8-01f49904d77b/resize/620x/7db34bab6ff069bb5ed25cbc6383428a/miller-2.png 1x\"></img></figure>\n<p>Miller eventually agreed to let the FBI seize some 5,000 artifacts so they could be returned to their countries of origin. But Carpenter said all the FBI's careful planning couldn't prepare them for another, more disturbing discovery.</p>\n<p>&quot;About 2,000 human bones,&quot; Carpenter said. &quot;To the best of our knowledge right now, those 2,000 bones represent about 500 human beings.&quot;</p>\n<p>Nearly all of those human remains, he said, were also dug up from ancient Native American burial sites.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's very staggering,&quot; Carpenter said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Why would anybody have that many human bones?&quot; Werner asked.</p>\n<p>&quot;I don't know. I truly don't know,&quot; Carpenter said.</p>\n<p>Native American burial sites dating back thousands of years have been a source of fascination for archeologists for decades. One old government film showed the excavation of an ancient Native American village in Alabama. Over time, many other sites have been looted by people seeking artifacts and even skeletons.<br>\n&quot;This comes down to a basic human right,&quot; said Holly Cusack-McVeigh, a professor of archaeology brought in by the FBI on the Miller case. <br>\n&quot;We have to think about the context of: Who has been the target of grave robbing for centuries?

                "text": "When the FBI showed up at Don Miller's home in rural Indiana in 2014 to seize part of his vast personal collection of artifacts, it was a shock for people who knew him.\n\"He was very beloved. He was very charismatic,\" former local reporter Liz Dykes said. Dykes interviewed the 90-year-old former engineer about his time in World War II, his missionary work in Haiti, and most of all, his huge collection of artifacts from around the world.\n\"The entire house is a museum. There are things everywhere,\" Dykes recounted. \"It was just mind-blowing.\"\nMiller willingly showed his collection to reporters, residents, and even local Boy Scout troops, so when the FBI came calling, she said, \"I wanted to know what they were looking for... There had to have been something.\"\nThere was: something the FBI hasn't talked about\u2014until now.\n\"When I first went into his house and saw the size of the collection, it was unlike anything we'd ever seen,\" Tim Carpenter, who heads the FBI's art crime unit, told CBS News correspondent Anna Werner. \"Not only me, but I don't think anybody on the art crime team.\"\nFBI photos \u2013 never before shown publicly \u2013 give a glimpse of the collection: some 42,000 items, including pre-Colombian pottery, an Italian mosaic, and items from China, some that Miller labeled \"Chinese Jewelry\" from 500 BC.\n\"Roughly half of the collection was Native American, and the other half of the collection was from every corner of the globe,\" Carpenter said.\nBut the problem? Carpenter said a lot of it had been illegally obtained. Miller admitted he'd gone on digging expeditions in foreign countries and around the United States for decades in violation of antiquities laws.\n\"Did he understand that he had obtained some things illegally?\" Werner asked.\n\"He did,\" Carpenter said, adding that Miller admitted to it.\nMiller eventually agreed to let the FBI seize some 5,000 artifacts so they could be returned to their countries of origin. But Carpenter said all the FBI's careful planning couldn't prepare them for another, more disturbing discovery.\n\"About 2,000 human bones,\" Carpenter said. \"To the best of our knowledge right now, those 2,000 bones represent about 500 human beings.\"\nNearly all of those human remains, he said, were also dug up from ancient Native American burial sites.\n\"It's very staggering,\" Carpenter said.\n\"Why would anybody have that many human bones?\" Werner asked.\n\"I don't know. I truly don't know,\" Carpenter said.\nNative American burial sites dating back thousands of years have been a source of fascination for archeologists for decades. One old government film showed the excavation of an ancient Native American village in Alabama. Over time, many other sites have been looted by people seeking artifacts and even skeletons.\n\"This comes down to a basic human right,\" said Holly Cusack-McVeigh, a professor of archaeology brought in by the FBI on the Miller case.\n\"We have to think about the context of: Who has been the target of grave robbing for centuries? Whose ancestors have been collected for hobby?\" Cusack-McVeigh said. \"And this comes down to racism. They aren't digging white graves.\"\nExperts determined the remains found at Miller's residence likely came from Native American tribes including the Arikara. In North Dakota, tribal official Pete Coffey is working with the FBI to bring them home.\n\"All too often here we have been treated as curiosities rather than a people here,\" Coffey said. \"They could very well be my own great, great, great, great grandfather, or grandmother, you know, that had been \u2013 I characterize it as being ripped out of the earth, you know.\"\nMiller died in 2015.

These are human beings and people. It matters. It has meaning to people today, it has meaning to our children and their children,\" Carpenter said.\nSo far, the FBI has already returned items from Miller's collection to several countries, including Cambodia, Canada, Colombia, and Mexico. A Chinese delegation will go to Indianapolis this week to claim artifacts. They have already returned some Native American ancestral remains to tribes in the South Dakota region and are planning a large-scale repatriation of remains to other tribes in the coming months.",

According to court documents, her assailant got a key to her room from hotel staff without any security checks.</p>\n<p>Marchionda thought she did everything right to protect herself in that hotel, including using the safety bolt, but there were some things that came as a surprise to her in the wake of the attack &ndash; things that may be a surprise to many. While staying at an Embassy Suites in Des Moines, Iowa, Marchionda said she felt safe in large part because she believed in the brand, Hilton.</p>\n<p>&quot;You walk in and you see the name and you're trusting within the name. And through this process, I learned that it's not. There's owners, operators, franchisees,&quot; Marchionda told CBS News' Dana Jacobson. &quot;I think that's something that has to be more recognizable.&quot;</p>\n<p>In fact, many of these big brand hotels are franchises, meaning the owners and managers operate independently. Peter Villari, Marchionda's attorney, said that even though the Embassy Suites where she stayed was branded a Hilton, the management company John Q. Hammons and owner Atrium Hospitality were ultimately responsible for giving Christopher LaPointe access to Marchionda's room, where he sexually assaulted and raped her in the middle of the night.</p>\n<p>&quot;The court ultimately ruled that as the guest room key control, Embassy Suites and Hilton did not have ultimate responsibility,&quot; Villari said. &quot;I think within the industry we learned that it's quite common. I've had other cases like this &hellip; things get made by different people even though there's labels on them, you could be wearing a jacket by a name brand and it's made in China or anywhere in the world by some other company. So it works similarly in the hotel industry.&quot;</p>\n<p>Women's rights attorney Gloria Allred has represented several hotel assault victims, including Kayla Snipe who was raped in her hotel room in 2015. Snipe's attacker was given a key to her room without an ID check at an Embassy Suites in South Carolina. The case settled out of court.</p>\n<p>&quot;Even the hotels that have the best names in terms of the brand may present a risk of harm to you,&quot; Allred said. &quot;Every precaution should be taken by someone checking into a hotel that no one else is authorized to be in that room to be given a key.&quot;</p>\n<p>Attorney and professor of hospitality law Stephen Barth said travelers should be proactive about their safety. He recommends avoiding saying your name out loud at the front desk, requesting a different room if the desk agent says your room number aloud and ensuring nobody is looking at your ID when you hand it over during check in.</p>\n<p>&quot;When you sign off on the guest check, if you're billing it to the room ... hand that receipt with your information back to the server so that you know it's in the custody and control of the hotel and not some random person,&quot; Barth said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Businesses need to recognize they're asking people to go out and do things on their behalf and that they need to take an active role in teaching and training them about how to be safe and secure when they travel,&quot; Barth said.</p>\n<p>As for Cheri Marchionda, she's found her own way to feel a little safer again while on the road.</p>\n<p>&quot;I have a lock that I found and I use that everywhere I go. In fact, I carry two ... I always request no connecting doors but I always carry two, just in case I get that,&quot; Marchionda said.</p>\n<p>Portable door locks are easily available online, or even a simple rubber doorstop can help secure a hotel door. A few other things to keep in mind: When you're in the elevator, don't push your floor number first and someone gets out on your floor, let them go ahead of you. Also, request only one room key so you always know where it is.</p>\n<p>Hilton was not involved in Marchionda's lawsuit, but the company told us it maintains &quot;rigorous safety standards for Hilton-managed properties&quot; and expects the same of its franchised hotels.</p>",

                "text": "Cheri Marchionda, a mother of three, was sexually assaulted in her hotel room while traveling for work in 2014. According to court documents, her assailant got a key to her room from hotel staff without any security checks.\nMarchionda thought she did everything right to protect herself in that hotel, including using the safety bolt, but there were some things that came as a surprise to her in the wake of the attack \u2013 things that may be a surprise to many. While staying at an Embassy Suites in Des Moines, Iowa, Marchionda said she felt safe in large part because she believed in the brand, Hilton.\n\"You walk in and you see the name and you're trusting within the name. And through this process, I learned that it's not. There's owners, operators, franchisees,\" Marchionda told CBS News' Dana Jacobson. \"I think that's something that has to be more recognizable.\"\nIn fact, many of these big brand hotels are franchises, meaning the owners and managers operate independently. Peter Villari, Marchionda's attorney, said that even though the Embassy Suites where she stayed was branded a Hilton, the management company John Q. Hammons and owner Atrium Hospitality were ultimately responsible for giving Christopher LaPointe access to Marchionda's room, where he sexually assaulted and raped her in the middle of the night.\n\"The court ultimately ruled that as the guest room key control, Embassy Suites and Hilton did not have ultimate responsibility,\" Villari said. \"I think within the industry we learned that it's quite common. I've had other cases like this \u2026 things get made by different people even though there's labels on them, you could be wearing a jacket by a name brand and it's made in China or anywhere in the world by some other company. So it works similarly in the hotel industry.\"\nWomen's rights attorney Gloria Allred has represented several hotel assault victims, including Kayla Snipe who was raped in her hotel room in 2015. Snipe's attacker was given a key to her room without an ID check at an Embassy Suites in South Carolina. The case settled out of court.\n\"Even the hotels that have the best names in terms of the brand may present a risk of harm to you,\" Allred said. \"Every precaution should be taken by someone checking into a hotel that no one else is authorized to be in that room to be given a key.\"\nAttorney and professor of hospitality law Stephen Barth said travelers should be proactive about their safety. He recommends avoiding saying your name out loud at the front desk, requesting a different room if the desk agent says your room number aloud and ensuring nobody is looking at your ID when you hand it over during check in.\n\"When you sign off on the guest check, if you're billing it to the room ... hand that receipt with your information back to the server so that you know it's in the custody and control of the hotel and not some random person,\" Barth said.\n\"Businesses need to recognize they're asking people to go out and do things on their behalf and that they need to take an active role in teaching and training them about how to be safe and secure when they travel,\" Barth said.\nAs for Cheri Marchionda, she's found her own way to feel a little safer again while on the road.\n\"I have a lock that I found and I use that everywhere I go. In fact, I carry two ... I always request no connecting doors but I always carry two, just in case I get that,\" Marchionda said.\nPortable door locks are easily available online, or even a simple rubber doorstop can help secure a hotel door. A few other things to keep in mind: When you're in the elevator, don't push your floor number first and someone gets out on your floor, let them go ahead of you. Also, request only one room key so you always know where it is.\nHilton was not involved in Marchionda's lawsuit, but the company told us it maintains \"rigorous safety standards for Hilton-managed properties\" and expects the same of its franchised hotels.",

Cohen's hearing is related to hush money payments to women who alleged to have affairs with Mr. Trump in the months leading up to the election.</p>\n<p>According to a source familiar with the matter, Cohen will provide documents, prepared by Mr. Trump's accountant, that will show the president may have engaged in tax fraud, CBS News correspondent Paula Reid reports. This could be the basis for lawmakers or investigators to pursue Trump's tax returns. The source confirms that Cohen will also accuse the president of using racist language. His comments are described as &quot;chilling&quot; - this language was allegedly used in a series of personal conversations between Mr. Trump and Cohen.</p>\n<p>Cohen is <a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heres-who-has-been-charged-in-robert-muellers-probe/\">set to serve time in prison </a>for lying to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees in 2017. Some Republican lawmakers will likely use that fact to blunt the impact the allegations Cohen has made against the president during Wednesday's appearance before the House Oversight Committee.</p>\n<p>White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement following the release of details of Cohen's testimony, &quot;Disgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements. Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same,&quot;</p>\n<p>Sanders added, &quot;It's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.&quot;</p>\n<p>During a closed-door hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that could last hours, investigators from the Senate Intelligence Committee are expected to grill Cohen about his involvement in plans to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow and whether the president directed him to lie to Congress.</p>\n<p>Cohen's closed session testimony, which is hailed as one of the last bastions of bipartisanship in Congress, is part of a series of open and closed-door appearances he is scheduled to make on Capitol Hill this week. The president's former lawyer, who will start his <a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-grants-cohens-request-to-delay-prison-sentence/\">3-year prison sentence in early May</a> for violating campaign finance law, will likely face fierce questioning by committee staff and senators during Tuesday's hearing, which could last more than 10 hours.</p>\n<p>&quot;We will be extremely thorough,&quot; Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the committee's chairman, told reporters Tuesday evening, adding that he expects to hear the &quot;truth&quot; from Cohen.</p>\n<p>Cohen's appearing before the House panel comes after a delay to his initial testimony citing &quot;<a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-cohen-postpones-house-testimony/\">threats&quot; to his family by Mr. Trump</a> and the president's attorney Rudy Giuliani.

                "text": "President Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen will publicly accuse the president of criminal conduct and racism during his public hearing on Wednesday, CBS News has confirmed. Cohen's hearing is related to hush money payments to women who alleged to have affairs with Mr. Trump in the months leading up to the election.\nAccording to a source familiar with the matter, Cohen will provide documents, prepared by Mr. Trump's accountant, that will show the president may have engaged in tax fraud, CBS News correspondent Paula Reid reports. This could be the basis for lawmakers or investigators to pursue Trump's tax returns. The source confirms that Cohen will also accuse the president of using racist language. His comments are described as \"chilling\" - this language was allegedly used in a series of personal conversations between Mr. Trump and Cohen.\nCohen is set to serve time in prison for lying to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees in 2017. Some Republican lawmakers will likely use that fact to blunt the impact the allegations Cohen has made against the president during Wednesday's appearance before the House Oversight Committee.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement following the release of details of Cohen's testimony, \"Disgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements. Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same,\"\nSanders added, \"It's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.\"\nDuring a closed-door hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that could last hours, investigators from the Senate Intelligence Committee are expected to grill Cohen about his involvement in plans to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow and whether the president directed him to lie to Congress.\nCohen's closed session testimony, which is hailed as one of the last bastions of bipartisanship in Congress, is part of a series of open and closed-door appearances he is scheduled to make on Capitol Hill this week. The president's former lawyer, who will start his 3-year prison sentence in early May for violating campaign finance law, will likely face fierce questioning by committee staff and senators during Tuesday's hearing, which could last more than 10 hours.\n\"We will be extremely thorough,\" Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the committee's chairman, told reporters Tuesday evening, adding that he expects to hear the \"truth\" from Cohen.\nCohen's appearing before the House panel comes after a delay to his initial testimony citing \"threats\" to his family by Mr. Trump and the president's attorney Rudy Giuliani. Cohen now cooperating with Manhattan prosecutors on alleged financial crimes and questions about the Trump inaugural committee.",

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has vowed to reform her country's gun laws in response to the <a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/new-zealand-mosque-shooting-christchurch-video-livestream-latest-updates-2019-03-15/\">worst mass shooting</a> in the country's modern history. <a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-zealand-shooting-victims-foreigners-among-those-killed-wounded-deadly-attacks-2019-03-15/\">Fifty people were killed</a> when a gunman opened fire Friday at two different mosques in Christchurch. The 28-year-old suspect allegedly targeted Muslims because of his white nationalist and anti-immigrant views.</p>\n<p>Thirty-one people remained hospitalized on Monday, including nine in critical condition.</p>\n<p>&quot;To make our communities safer, the time to act is now,&quot; Ardern said, adding that the government had agreed on new gun laws to be implemented within the next 10 days -- swift action in response to the mass shooting, but with very few details, reported CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy.</p>\n<p>&quot;When Australia found itself tragically in a similar position to what we find ourselves now, they took 12 days to make their decision. We have taken 72 hours,&quot; Ardern said.</p>\n<p>She was alluding to Australia's reaction in 1996 after a mass shooting there left 35 people dead. A government-funded gun buyback and a virtual ban on owning semi-automatic rifles cut private gun ownership by almost a third. Australia now has one of the lowest gun murder rates in the world.</p>\n<p>The FBI is assisting what New Zealand police have called their largest-ever criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>All five guns used in Friday's rampage were purchased legally in New Zealand, including two semi-automatic rifles. A gun shop owner said the attacker purchased four guns from him through a &quot;police-verified online mail order process,&quot; but it was unclear whether any of those firearms were used in the shootings.</p>\n<p>The alleged shooter was formally charged with murder over the weekend. By law, his face was blurred in images broadcast of him standing in the courtroom. Authorities said the Australian native acted alone and was not on any terrorist watch lists.</p>\n<p>On Monday, police searched two homes in Australia near where he once lived.</p>\n<p>Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed was inside the Linwood mosque during the shooting on Friday. He lost seven of his close friends.</p>\n<p>&quot;I can't put it to words,&quot; Ahmed told CBS News. &quot;It's a very closely knitted community so, yeah, it's like we lost all the good people there.&quot;</p>\n<p>The two mosques where the shootings took place were still closed on Monday, but police hoped to have them open by the end of the week.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the alleged shooter has apparently fired his lawyer and plans to represent himself. The fear is that he will use his trial as a platform for his white nationalist beliefs.</p>\n<p>The world was also learning more on Monday about some of the people killed in the attack. The <a data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-zealand-mosque-shootings-victim-mucaad-ibrahim-mourned-christchurch-2019-03-17/\">youngest was just three years old</a>.</p>\n<p>A makeshift memorial has become a focal point for the Christchurch community, which remained in shock three days after the attack. Tracy said he saw many people stand there with tears in their eyes, wondering how something like this could happen in New Zealand, one of the safest countries in the world.</p>\n<figure data-ads=\"{\"extraWordCount\":50}\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/06/12/e6e6111c-747a-4835-8bf7-3a6b6131a360/resize/620x/6d2d1c9e184676243113a2dff8c6786c/ap16164449929875.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/06/12/e6e6111c-747a-4835-8bf7-3a6b6131a360/resize/620x/6d2d1c9e184676243113a2dff8c6786c/ap16164449929875.jpg 1x\"></img><figcaption>&copy; 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

                "text": "New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has vowed to reform her country's gun laws in response to the worst mass shooting in the country's modern history. Fifty people were killed when a gunman opened fire Friday at two different mosques in Christchurch. The 28-year-old suspect allegedly targeted Muslims because of his white nationalist and anti-immigrant views.\nThirty-one people remained hospitalized on Monday, including nine in critical condition.\n\"To make our communities safer, the time to act is now,\" Ardern said, adding that the government had agreed on new gun laws to be implemented within the next 10 days -- swift action in response to the mass shooting, but with very few details, reported CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy.\n\"When Australia found itself tragically in a similar position to what we find ourselves now, they took 12 days to make their decision. We have taken 72 hours,\" Ardern said.\nShe was alluding to Australia's reaction in 1996 after a mass shooting there left 35 people dead. A government-funded gun buyback and a virtual ban on owning semi-automatic rifles cut private gun ownership by almost a third. Australia now has one of the lowest gun murder rates in the world.\nThe FBI is assisting what New Zealand police have called their largest-ever criminal investigation.\nAll five guns used in Friday's rampage were purchased legally in New Zealand, including two semi-automatic rifles. A gun shop owner said the attacker purchased four guns from him through a \"police-verified online mail order process,\" but it was unclear whether any of those firearms were used in the shootings.\nThe alleged shooter was formally charged with murder over the weekend. By law, his face was blurred in images broadcast of him standing in the courtroom. Authorities said the Australian native acted alone and was not on any terrorist watch lists.\nOn Monday, police searched two homes in Australia near where he once lived.\nMazharuddin Syed Ahmed was inside the Linwood mosque during the shooting on Friday. He lost seven of his close friends.\n\"I can't put it to words,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"It's a very closely knitted community so, yeah, it's like we lost all the good people there.\"\nThe two mosques where the shootings took place were still closed on Monday, but police hoped to have them open by the end of the week.\nMeanwhile, the alleged shooter has apparently fired his lawyer and plans to represent himself. The fear is that he will use his trial as a platform for his white nationalist beliefs.\nThe world was also learning more on Monday about some of the people killed in the attack. The youngest was just three years old.\nA makeshift memorial has become a focal point for the Christchurch community, which remained in shock three days after the attack. Tracy said he saw many people stand there with tears in their eyes, wondering how something like this could happen in New Zealand, one of the safest countries in the world.",

According to CBS affiliate WJAX-TV, officials at the Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens said the female zookeeper came into contact with Archie, a 50-year-old male southern white rhino, during a routine training session.\nThe zoo's executive director, Tony Vecchio, said he does not know the zookeeper's condition, but said she was alert and talking with EMTs.\nVecchio described training as \"hands on,\" but there are safety barriers in place. Archie, who is on display with other rhinos, was never out of his space or a threat to the public.\n\"Archie has a clean personnel file, he's never done anything out of the ordinary,\" Vecchio said.\nThe zoo's safety and security chief and curator will now conduct an investigation and make recommendations on how to improve safety.\nIn October, WJAX reported another zookeeper at the Jacksonville zoo was shocked by an electric fence. It happened when the zoo said a lion got too close to an employee. But they were not seriously injured, and said the situation was under control in minutes.",
