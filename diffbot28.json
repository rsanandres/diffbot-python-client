The First Circuit Court of Hawaii <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2011/12/20/lesbian-couple-sues-hawaiian-bb-discrimination\">ruled in their favor</a> in 2013 and ordered Young to cease discriminating against same-sex couples. The state&rsquo;s Intermediate Court of Appeals <a href=\"http://https://www.advocate.com/business/2018/2/27/court-rules-hawaii-bb-owner-discriminated-against-lesbian-couple\">upheld that ruling</a> in February 2018, and in July the Hawaii Supreme Court <a href=\"http://https://www.advocate.com/business/2018/7/11/hawaii-court-sides-lesbian-couple-barred-bed-breakfast\">declined to hear a further appeal</a> from the B&amp;B.</p>\n<p>But in October, Aloha B&amp;B filed a petition for review with the U.S. Supreme Court, &ldquo;citing a First Amendment right to refuse service to same-sex couples for religious reasons,&rdquo; the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/2019/03/18/supreme-court-rebuffs-hawaii-bb-seeking-to-deny-boarding-to-same-sex-couples/\"><em>Washington Blade</em></a> reports. The business also claimed it was denied due process under the Fourteenth Amendment because Young wasn&rsquo;t didn&rsquo;t receive sufficient notice that the civil rights law would apply to her operation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Commission officially labeled her religious beliefs unlawful &lsquo;discrimination&rsquo; despite the fact that Mrs. Young declines to rent bedrooms in her family home to any romantic partners other than a married man and women &mdash; Hawaii&rsquo;s only recognized form of marriage in 2007,&rdquo; said the petition. &ldquo;For this &lsquo;crime&rsquo; of being a faithful Catholic, the Commission sought punitive damages and statutory penalties that could cause Mrs. Young to lose her home.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The high court <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/031819zor_c07d.pdf\">denied the petition Monday</a> without saying why it was doing so, as is usually the case.</p>\n<p>Peter Renn, a lawyer in Lambda Legal&rsquo;s Western Regional Office, said the denial represents a victory for nondiscrimination laws. &ldquo;The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision to let the lower court ruling stand reaffirms that the freedom of religion does not give businesses a right to violate nondiscrimination laws that protect all individuals from harm, whether on the basis of race, gender or sexual orientation,&rdquo; he told the <em>Blade.</em> &ldquo;The Supreme Court declined to consider carving out an exception from this basic principle when a business discriminates based on the sexual orientation of its customers. LGBT people deserve an equal right to go about their everyday life without the fear that discrimination waits for them around the corner.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been almost a year since the Supreme Court ruled in another &ldquo;license to discriminate&rdquo; case, <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission.</em> Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips had refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, saying it would conflict with his Christian beliefs. The commission found he had violated state antidiscrimination law, and Colorado courts agreed, but the <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/business/2018/6/04/supreme-court-sides-against-same-sex-couples\">Supreme Court ruled in his favor</a> because, the majority of justices said, the commission had shown insufficient respect for his beliefs. It vacated the commission&rsquo;s ruling but did not create a broad license to discriminate. Several <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/politics/2018/12/31/2019-supreme-court-preview-danger-ahead\">similar cases</a> are being appealed to the court, and it remains to be seen if it will decide to hear them.</p>\n<p>The anti-LGBTQ Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented Phillips, had represented Young and Aloha B&amp;B during some of the legal proceedings, but a private lawyer, James Hochberg, filed the Hawaii business&rsquo;s petition to the Supreme Court. The <em>Blade </em>sought comment from him, but he had not responded by press time.</p>",

Three Alabama members of the U.S. House trailed him &mdash; Mo Brooks with 18 percent, Bradley Byrne with 13 percent, and Gary Palmer with 11 percent. State Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh had 4 percent, and businessman Tim Jones had 2 percent. A quarter of respondents were undecided.</p>\n<p>Moore is well-known for his anti-LGBTQ stances. As chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, he fought marriage equality, claiming that the state didn&rsquo;t have to obey the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling on the matter. In 2017 he was removed from the state&rsquo;s high court for good, due to ethics violations related to his efforts against equal marriage rights. He then ran in a special election for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, ultimately <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/politics/2017/12/12/breaking-doug-jones-defeats-homophobe-roy-moore-alabama\">losing to Democrat Doug Jones.</a> The race was marked by accusations by several women of pedophilia and other sexual misconduct on Moore&rsquo;s part.</p>\n<p>Jones&rsquo;s term is up in 2020, and in the poll, 40 percent of respondents said they would vote to reelect him, 50 percent would replace him with a Republican, and 10 percent were undecided.</p>\n<p>Byrne is the only Republican who has formally declared his candidacy so far, but Moore has said he is thinking about another Senate run. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m seriously considering it,&rdquo; he told American Family Radio host Bryan Fischer, whose homophobia matches Moore&rsquo;s, last month.</p>\n<p>Moore&rsquo;s poll results reflect the fact that he has greater name recognition than others in the Republican field, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roy-moore-leads-in-alabama-senate-race-poll/\">CBS News</a> reports. But his extremism and the accusations will likely put off many voters, the network notes. &ldquo;The national Democrats would be happy to have such a controversial candidate opposing Jones,&rdquo; according to CBS. &ldquo;Jones might not beat a traditional Republican candidate in 2020 &mdash; but Democrats know that he has already beaten Roy Moore once.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Prominent homophobe Roy Moore, who\u2019s threatening to run for U.S. senator from Alabama again, leads other potential Republican candidates in a new poll.\nIn the survey released today by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy, 27 percent of respondents said they\u2019d support Moore if the Republican primary were held now. Three Alabama members of the U.S. House trailed him \u2014 Mo Brooks with 18 percent, Bradley Byrne with 13 percent, and Gary Palmer with 11 percent. State Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh had 4 percent, and businessman Tim Jones had 2 percent. A quarter of respondents were undecided.\nMoore is well-known for his anti-LGBTQ stances. As chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, he fought marriage equality, claiming that the state didn\u2019t have to obey the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the matter. In 2017 he was removed from the state\u2019s high court for good, due to ethics violations related to his efforts against equal marriage rights. He then ran in a special election for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, ultimately losing to Democrat Doug Jones. The race was marked by accusations by several women of pedophilia and other sexual misconduct on Moore\u2019s part.\nJones\u2019s term is up in 2020, and in the poll, 40 percent of respondents said they would vote to reelect him, 50 percent would replace him with a Republican, and 10 percent were undecided.\nByrne is the only Republican who has formally declared his candidacy so far, but Moore has said he is thinking about another Senate run. \u201cI\u2019m seriously considering it,\u201d he told American Family Radio host Bryan Fischer, whose homophobia matches Moore\u2019s, last month.\nMoore\u2019s poll results reflect the fact that he has greater name recognition than others in the Republican field, CBS News reports. But his extremism and the accusations will likely put off many voters, the network notes. \u201cThe national Democrats would be happy to have such a controversial candidate opposing Jones,\u201d according to CBS. \u201cJones might not beat a traditional Republican candidate in 2020 \u2014 but Democrats know that he has already beaten Roy Moore once.\u201d",

Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, co-chair of the <a href=\"https://lgbt-cicilline.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-lgbt-caucus-announces-largest-membership-in-caucus-history-with\">growing</a> Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, <a href=\"https://seanmaloney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/maloney-introduces-legislation-to-ban-use-of-taxpayer-dollars-for\">filed legislation</a> last month to crack down on any use of Medicaid funds for &quot;conversion therapy.&quot;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Conversion practices are discredited, harmful and not therapy,&rdquo; Maloney said. &ldquo;Fundamentally, conversion tactics are based on the idea that a person&rsquo;s gender identity or sexual orientation are diseases to be cured.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Maloney, the first out congressman <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/politics/election/2012/11/07/openly-gay-congressional-winner-makes-history-new-york\">elected in New York</a>, said questionable billing techniques actually get the government to foot the bill on such debunked and hurtful services.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Until we can just ban conversion &lsquo;therapy&rsquo; all together, we must ensure taxpayer dollars aren&rsquo;t funding a fraudulent practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community. That&rsquo;s exactly what my bill would do,&rdquo; Maloney said.</p>\n<p>The problem is that while Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income Americans, gets funded by federal taxpayer dollars, states largely decide how money gets spent. Since the bulk of state legislatures have no problem letting &ldquo;therapists&rdquo; sell counseling to suppress gay, bi, and trans identity, illegitimate practices like &ldquo;reparative&rdquo; therapy get covered by public funds in many places. Typically, the services get filed as &ldquo;mental and behavioral health services.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Maloney&rsquo;s bill would establish a definition for what constitutes therapy and put federal parameters in place that disallow any federal dollars being funneled toward the questionable practice, while still ensuring Medicaid can support legitimate services provided to LGBTQ patients.</p>\n<p>His bill out of the gate enjoyed 63 co-sponsors. The list includes other out representatives like Mark Takano, David Cicilline, Mark Pocan, Angie Craig, and Chris Pappas. With a new Democratic majority, the bill could be bound for passage.</p>\n<p>Advocates for LGBTQ youth say it&rsquo;s critical for the federal government to defund &ldquo;conversion therapy.&rdquo; The Trevor Project, which is pushing for <a href=\"https://www.thetrevorproject.org/get-involved/trevor-advocacy/50-bills-50-states/\">bans on the practice in every state</a>, applauded the legislation.</p>\n<p>&quot;The Trevor Project hears from youth harmed by the dangerous and discredited practice of conversion therapy every week. By limiting the means by which licensed mental health professionals can be reimbursed for their horrific practice, the Prohibition of Medicaid Funding for Conversion Therapy Act will make clear that conversion therapy is far outside the mainstream,&quot; Sam Brinton, Head of Advocacy and Government Affairs for The Trevor Project, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Education professionals also rallied around the bill. Marc Negan, spokesperson for the National Education Association, praised Maloney&rsquo;s legislation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Many organizations, including the American College of Physicians, have discredited any programs that attempt to change a person&rsquo;s sexual orientation or gender identity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These dangerous practices damage physical, mental, and emotional well-being. As educators, NEA members strive to connect with and support all students, which means recognizing their right to be exactly who they are and opposing all practices that deny this right.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://service.qfie.com/HERE/clsOUTNewOrdForm.asp?straspreason=210&pubcode=out&trackcode=JPOX9F\"><img alt=\"Out Magazine\" src=\"https://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/out_subbanner_750x211_3.jpg\"></img></a></figure>",

                "text": "Selling so-called conversion therapy services to minors remains legal in most U.S. states, but new legislation threatens any federal funding going to the practice.\nRep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, co-chair of the growing Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, filed legislation last month to crack down on any use of Medicaid funds for \"conversion therapy.\"\n\u201cConversion practices are discredited, harmful and not therapy,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cFundamentally, conversion tactics are based on the idea that a person\u2019s gender identity or sexual orientation are diseases to be cured.\u201d\nMaloney, the first out congressman elected in New York, said questionable billing techniques actually get the government to foot the bill on such debunked and hurtful services.\n\u201cUntil we can just ban conversion \u2018therapy\u2019 all together, we must ensure taxpayer dollars aren\u2019t funding a fraudulent practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community. That\u2019s exactly what my bill would do,\u201d Maloney said.\nThe problem is that while Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income Americans, gets funded by federal taxpayer dollars, states largely decide how money gets spent. Since the bulk of state legislatures have no problem letting \u201ctherapists\u201d sell counseling to suppress gay, bi, and trans identity, illegitimate practices like \u201creparative\u201d therapy get covered by public funds in many places. Typically, the services get filed as \u201cmental and behavioral health services.\u201d\nMaloney\u2019s bill would establish a definition for what constitutes therapy and put federal parameters in place that disallow any federal dollars being funneled toward the questionable practice, while still ensuring Medicaid can support legitimate services provided to LGBTQ patients.\nHis bill out of the gate enjoyed 63 co-sponsors. The list includes other out representatives like Mark Takano, David Cicilline, Mark Pocan, Angie Craig, and Chris Pappas. With a new Democratic majority, the bill could be bound for passage.\nAdvocates for LGBTQ youth say it\u2019s critical for the federal government to defund \u201cconversion therapy.\u201d The Trevor Project, which is pushing for bans on the practice in every state, applauded the legislation.\n\"The Trevor Project hears from youth harmed by the dangerous and discredited practice of conversion therapy every week. By limiting the means by which licensed mental health professionals can be reimbursed for their horrific practice, the Prohibition of Medicaid Funding for Conversion Therapy Act will make clear that conversion therapy is far outside the mainstream,\" Sam Brinton, Head of Advocacy and Government Affairs for The Trevor Project, said in a statement.\nEducation professionals also rallied around the bill. Marc Negan, spokesperson for the National Education Association, praised Maloney\u2019s legislation.\n\u201cMany organizations, including the American College of Physicians, have discredited any programs that attempt to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d he said. \u201cThese dangerous practices damage physical, mental, and emotional well-being. As educators, NEA members strive to connect with and support all students, which means recognizing their right to be exactly who they are and opposing all practices that deny this right.\u201d",

Another contender for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, had a town hall Monday on Fox News.</p>\n<p>Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/news/2019/4/12/pete-buttigieg-has-officially-announced-his-run-president\">formally announced</a> his presidential campaign over the weekend, after having <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/politics/2019/1/23/mayor-pete-buttigieg-nation-ready-gay-millennial-president\">formed an exploratory committee</a> in January. He <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/politics/2019/4/01/pete-buttigieg-has-already-raised-historic-7m-supporters\">raised $7 million</a> in campaign funds in the first quarter of the year, and he has raised <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/politics/2019/4/15/pete-buttigieg-raised-over-million-dollars-after-announcing-run\">another $1 million</a> since his official announcement. He&rsquo;s polling ahead of several other hopefuls and has become something of a media star.</p>\n<p>The Democratic Party isn&rsquo;t fond of Fox News &ndash; Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez announced this year that the party wouldn&rsquo;t have any debates on Fox, due to its coziness with Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration. Buttigieg is so far the only Democratic hopeful to appear on <em>Fox News Sunday</em> this year.</p>\n<p>Buttigieg also <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/james-murdoch-makes-donation-to-pete-buttigiegs-2020-presidential-campaign/\">recently received a $2,800 donation</a> from James Murdoch, a member of the family that controls Fox News. Murdoch, who has no role in the revamped Fox Corp. that emerged after many Fox assets were sold to the Walt Disney Co., is known as one of the more liberal members of the generally conservative family. His brother Lachlan heads Fox Corp., and their father, Rupert Murdoch, was long at the helm of the Fox empire. Other celebrity donors to Buttigieg include Ellen DeGeneres, Ryan Reynolds, and Mandy Moore.</p>",

                "text": "UPDATE (April, 23rd): Mayor Pete Buttigieg will host his Fox News town hall on May 19th with Chris Wallace hosting.\nHe will be the first openly gay candidate allowed into this forum on the notoriously conservative network.\n***\nDespite the Fox News Channel\u2019s general unfriendliness to LGBTQ causes, gay Democratic presidential aspirant Pete Buttigieg is negotiating to do a town hall on the outlet.\n\u201cReaching out to the Fox audience is something we intend to do,\u201d a spokesperson for Buttigieg\u2019s campaign told The Hill today. Another contender for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, had a town hall Monday on Fox News.\nButtigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., formally announced his presidential campaign over the weekend, after having formed an exploratory committee in January. He raised $7 million in campaign funds in the first quarter of the year, and he has raised another $1 million since his official announcement. He\u2019s polling ahead of several other hopefuls and has become something of a media star.\nThe Democratic Party isn\u2019t fond of Fox News \u2013 Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez announced this year that the party wouldn\u2019t have any debates on Fox, due to its coziness with Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Buttigieg is so far the only Democratic hopeful to appear on Fox News Sunday this year.\nButtigieg also recently received a $2,800 donation from James Murdoch, a member of the family that controls Fox News. Murdoch, who has no role in the revamped Fox Corp. that emerged after many Fox assets were sold to the Walt Disney Co., is known as one of the more liberal members of the generally conservative family. His brother Lachlan heads Fox Corp., and their father, Rupert Murdoch, was long at the helm of the Fox empire. Other celebrity donors to Buttigieg include Ellen DeGeneres, Ryan Reynolds, and Mandy Moore.",

ADF famously represented Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop, who refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, in a case that went to the Supreme Court in 2017. A ruling in Phillips&rsquo;s favor <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/business/2018/6/04/supreme-court-sides-against-same-sex-couples\">came down last year,</a> although the court did not recognize a broad right to discriminate.</p>\n<p>The Family Research Council, whose president, Tony Perkins, has <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2017/11/09/right-wing-now-controls-west-wing-heres-their-ultimate-goal\">close ties to Donald Trump</a> and has <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/election/2016/7/11/republican-platform-takes-stands-against-restroom-access-ex-gay-therapy\">advised the Republican Party on its national platform,</a> received more than $5.3 million during the three years covered by the report.</p>\n<p>Those two groups &ldquo;spread vicious propaganda and disinformation, othering and maligning members of the LGBTQ community, which is a key reason they are rightly considered hate groups,&rdquo; Chris Stroop, a journalist and former evangelical Christian, told <em>Sludge.</em></p>\n<p>&ldquo;In terms of aggressively pushing an anti-LGBTQ and anti-abortion, &lsquo;pro-family&rsquo; agenda, it makes sense to me that [the foundation] would invest heavily in Alliance Defending Freedom and Family Research Council,&rdquo; Stroop added. &ldquo;Those outfits are at the very heart of the Christian right lobby; they&rsquo;re well-connected, well-heeled, and effective.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The amount of funding coming through the National Christian Foundation is stunning, Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC&rsquo;s Intelligence Project, told the site. &ldquo;I certainly don&rsquo;t know of any public disclosures of funds to hate groups at levels anywhere near this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty astounding and certainly concerning.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While the identities of donors to the foundation are not automatically made public, some are known, according to <em>Sludge.</em> They include David Green, the founder of Hobby Lobby; major Republican funder Foster Friess; and several other foundations.</p>\n<p>The National Christian Foundation, which is the fourth-largest donor-advised fund in the nation, has funneled donors&rsquo; money to anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant organizations as well as anti-LGBTQ ones, <em>Sludge</em> reports. Most such funds have no policies concerning donations to identified hate groups, saying any nonprofit organization that has been granted 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status by the IRS is eligible.</p>\n<p>One of the few that has a policy restricting donations is the Amalgamated Foundation, which states that it prohibits money from going to &ldquo;hateful activities &hellip; targeting an individual or group based on their actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Aaron Dorfman, president and CEO of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, said more donor-advised funds should adopt such policies. &ldquo;With the dramatic escalation of violence and intimidation by white nationalists and right-wing extremists, it&rsquo;s way past due for sponsors of donor-advised funds to cut off any dollars flowing to hate groups,&rdquo; he told <em>Sludge.</em> &ldquo;They have every right to exercise discretion by refusing a donor&rsquo;s request to fund a hate group. Just as companies have come under pressure to deny those groups financial and technology platforms following Charlottesville, the Tree of Life massacre, and now New Zealand, foundations should similarly deny them philanthropic services. It&rsquo;s more than just a best practice, it&rsquo;s common decency.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://service.qfie.com/HERE/clsOUTNewOrdForm.asp?straspreason=210&pubcode=out&trackcode=JPOX9F\"><img alt=\"Out Magazine\" src=\"https://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/out_subbanner_750x211_3.jpg\"></img></a></figure>\n<h2> From our Sponsors </h2>",

                "text": "The National Christian Foundation, the eighth-largest public charity in the U.S., has been funneling millions of dollars to anti-LGBTQ hate groups, including the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council.\nThe donations, disclosed in the foundation\u2019s tax filings, were reported today by Sludge, an investigative journalism site.\nThe foundation is a donor-advised fund. \u201cSuch funds offer individual accounts to their clients, allowing clients to get immediate tax breaks on donations to these accounts and to direct NCF to disperse the money to the nonprofits of their choice, mostly churches and other Christian nonprofits, at their own pace,\u201d Sludge reports. \u201cClients donate through donor-advised funds anonymously, so even the Internal Revenue Service won\u2019t know their identities.\u201d\nIts three most recent IRS filings \u2014 for 2015 through 2017 \u2014 show it dispersed $56.1 million in client funds to organizations designated as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center, according to Sludge.\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal group that represents many anti-LGBTQ and anti-abortion clients, received $49.2 million over that period, $46.3 million of it in its 2016 fiscal year \u2014 July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016. ADF famously represented Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop, who refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, in a case that went to the Supreme Court in 2017. A ruling in Phillips\u2019s favor came down last year, although the court did not recognize a broad right to discriminate.\nThe Family Research Council, whose president, Tony Perkins, has close ties to Donald Trump and has advised the Republican Party on its national platform, received more than $5.3 million during the three years covered by the report.\nThose two groups \u201cspread vicious propaganda and disinformation, othering and maligning members of the LGBTQ community, which is a key reason they are rightly considered hate groups,\u201d Chris Stroop, a journalist and former evangelical Christian, told Sludge.\n\u201cIn terms of aggressively pushing an anti-LGBTQ and anti-abortion, \u2018pro-family\u2019 agenda, it makes sense to me that [the foundation] would invest heavily in Alliance Defending Freedom and Family Research Council,\u201d Stroop added. \u201cThose outfits are at the very heart of the Christian right lobby; they\u2019re well-connected, well-heeled, and effective.\u201d\nThe amount of funding coming through the National Christian Foundation is stunning, Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC\u2019s Intelligence Project, told the site. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t know of any public disclosures of funds to hate groups at levels anywhere near this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty astounding and certainly concerning.\u201d\nWhile the identities of donors to the foundation are not automatically made public, some are known, according to Sludge. They include David Green, the founder of Hobby Lobby; major Republican funder Foster Friess; and several other foundations.\nThe National Christian Foundation, which is the fourth-largest donor-advised fund in the nation, has funneled donors\u2019 money to anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant organizations as well as anti-LGBTQ ones, Sludge reports. Most such funds have no policies concerning donations to identified hate groups, saying any nonprofit organization that has been granted 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status by the IRS is eligible.\nOne of the few that has a policy restricting donations is the Amalgamated Foundation, which states that it prohibits money from going to \u201chateful activities \u2026 targeting an individual or group based on their actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability.\u201d\nAaron Dorfman, president and CEO of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, said more donor-advised funds should adopt such policies. \u201cWith the dramatic escalation of violence and intimidation by white nationalists and right-wing extremists, it\u2019s way past due for sponsors of donor-advised funds to cut off any dollars flowing to hate groups,\u201d he told Sludge. \u201cThey have every right to exercise discretion by refusing a donor\u2019s request to fund a hate group. Just as companies have come under pressure to deny those groups financial and technology platforms following Charlottesville, the Tree of Life massacre, and now New Zealand, foundations should similarly deny them philanthropic services. It\u2019s more than just a best practice, it\u2019s common decency.\u201d\nFrom our Sponsors",

The thinking goes that because the U.S. and China are such large powers, a failure of the bilateral relationship would have catastrophic consequences for both the economy and global security.</p>\n<p>This logic encouraged the American establishment to <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/sifting-through-interdependence/\">assume</a> that economic interdependence between the two powers would promote stability. Both parties, they reasoned, would fear the consequences of discord and thus moderate their behavior. For many years, this assumption held up. But given China&rsquo;s increasingly unrestrained and threatening behavior since Xi Jinping assumed power, American leaders have <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/02/establishment-adopts-trump-views-china-military-threat-trade/\">grown uncertain</a> as to whether economic interdependence with China is beneficial for the U.S.</p>\n<p>But even if deep economic ties with China are a net positive for the U.S., should they ever really grow &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo;? That phrase is a curious one, given the nasty reputation it&rsquo;s developed since the 2008 financial meltdown. It is most commonly used to describe the problem of moral hazard risk during financial crises, which provides a surprisingly useful analogy for the U.S.-China political-economic relationship. Economists have argued that the 2008 crisis was worsened by the fact that financial institutions, well aware of their systemic importance to the American economy, engaged in risky behavior because they knew they would likely be bailed out in the event of a crisis. Most importantly, those institutions believed that American lawmakers understood that it was not in their political interest to allow the banks to collapse.</p>\n<p>An analogous problem arises from China&rsquo;s extensive economic ties with the U.S. (and other countries). If the Chinese government is aware that the relationship is perceived in Washington as &ldquo;too big to fail,&rdquo; it might reason that it can get away with all sorts of egregious acts without suffering serious consequences. Deep economic ties with China increase the likelihood that American politicians will be unable or unwilling to let the relationship fail. In fact, this logic led China to incorrectly <a href=\"http://opinion.huanqiu.com/editorial/2018-04/11766841.html?agt=50/xh\">assume</a> that President Donald Trump&rsquo;s trade war threats were merely bluffs. Beijing understood, for example, that a collapse in Chinese soybean purchases would directly harm the pocketbooks of Trump&rsquo;s base. It also knew that Fortune 500 companies would be extremely displeased. It therefore believed that it wasn&rsquo;t in Trump&rsquo;s political interest to risk the economic relationship.</p>\n<p>In this way, economic engagement with China can be destabilizing, not to mention threatening to a variety of American interests, when it emboldens the worst tendencies of China&rsquo;s &ldquo;president for life.&rdquo; Of course, there have been times when Chinese and American actions have been restrained. For instance, China&rsquo;s military hawks have <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/feb/10/chinese-see-us-debt-as-weapon/\">advocated</a>, unsuccessfully, for Beijing to dump massive quantities of U.S. treasuries in response to American naval actions in China&rsquo;s backyard. Because the two nations are so economically interdependent, such a move would have caused too much damage to the Chinese economy.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, differences in domestic institutions have made this logic untenable under many circumstances. As an autocracy, the Chinese Communist Party is never beholden to domestic interest groups in the way that U.S. politicians typically are. For example, when China <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html\">halted</a> exports of rare earth minerals to Japan in 2010 following a dispute over the East China Sea, the Chinese Communist Party did not risk being voted out of office by its mining industry. But for the Japanese government, allowing the tech sector to come to a grinding halt as a result of losing that mineral supply would have been political suicide. Because economic independence constrained the Japanese government and not the Chinese government, Beijing prevailed. As China&rsquo;s economic relations with other nations grow, this problem will only get worse.</p>\n<p>While Trump&rsquo;s trade war may help course-correct the economic relationship, it will not eliminate this inherent vulnerability if it doesn&rsquo;t reduce economic ties between the two countries. If China&rsquo;s domestic institutions remain unchanged, the U.S. will be far more constrained by the relationship than China will ever be. Therefore, allowing &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo; is unsafe for American interests.</p>\n<p>To be sure, just because the U.S. should be concerned about a &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo; problem doesn&rsquo;t mean it should let the relationship with China fail entirely or sever economic ties. That would be disastrous for all parties. But making it clear to China that the U.S. <em>can</em> reduce ties if necessary is a critical part of developing a healthier bilateral relationship. And given the nature of democratic institutions, the only way to reduce this vulnerability is to pursue more limited economic engagement with China.</p>\n<p>New Zealand provides a disturbing example. As China&rsquo;s economic ties with New Zealand have expanded, Chinese behavior has grown more menacing. A 2018 <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/csis-scrs/documents/publications/CSIS-Academic-Outreach-China-report-May-2018-en.pdf\">report</a> from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service details China&rsquo;s elaborate strategy in New Zealand to &ldquo;influence political decision-making, pursue unfair advantages in trade and business, suppress criticism of China, facilitate espionage opportunities, and influence overseas Chinese communities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>These programs have a long history in China. But President Xi Jinping, presiding over an era of unprecedented national economic prowess, has taken them to new extremes. For example, Anne-Marie Brady, a Chinese politics professor at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, was subjected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/23/im-being-watched-anne-marie-brady-the-china-critic-living-in-fear-of-beijing\">a year-long intimidation campaign</a> that she said was orchestrated by the Chinese government. After publishing her research on Chinese influence operations abroad, her house was burglarized, her office was broken into twice, and her family car was sabotaged. She also received threatening letters and numerous phone calls in the middle of the night on her unlisted number. New Zealand has done little to counter these threats, likely due to fear of economic retaliation from the Chinese government. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/18/jacinda-ardern-disputes-reports-of-diplomatic-tensions-with-china\">called</a> her country&rsquo;s relationship with China &ldquo;robust and mature.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>China&rsquo;s response to other nations&rsquo; restrictions on Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, may foreshadow this. Beijing recently banned Australian coal imports, a move that was <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/02/21/china-australia-coal-imports/\">likely retaliation</a> for Australia banning Huawei from its 5G networks. Similarly, after New Zealand restricted the use of Huawei equipment in its national 5G network, Beijing rescinded its invitation for Ardern to visit Beijing and <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-19/china-tourists-punishing-new-zealand-over-huawei-decision/10825340\">called off</a> the China-New Zealand Year of Tourism program.</p>\n<p>The predatory nature of China&rsquo;s global economic ambitions should necessitate that the U.S. stop considering its relationship &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo; and encourage its allies to pursue more limited economic engagement. The Trump administration&rsquo;s inclination to insult our allies while showing bitter contempt for multilateralism will likely make this task more difficult, if not impossible for the foreseeable future. But if the U.S. fails, China&rsquo;s behavior is certain to get only worse in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Nick Taber is an analyst of Chinese public policy.

                "text": "In an interview with CNBC in January, Myron Brilliant of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce described the American-Chinese relationship as \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d In recent years, a number of commentators and public figures have used that same phrase. The thinking goes that because the U.S. and China are such large powers, a failure of the bilateral relationship would have catastrophic consequences for both the economy and global security.\nThis logic encouraged the American establishment to assume that economic interdependence between the two powers would promote stability. Both parties, they reasoned, would fear the consequences of discord and thus moderate their behavior. For many years, this assumption held up. But given China\u2019s increasingly unrestrained and threatening behavior since Xi Jinping assumed power, American leaders have grown uncertain as to whether economic interdependence with China is beneficial for the U.S.\nBut even if deep economic ties with China are a net positive for the U.S., should they ever really grow \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d? That phrase is a curious one, given the nasty reputation it\u2019s developed since the 2008 financial meltdown. It is most commonly used to describe the problem of moral hazard risk during financial crises, which provides a surprisingly useful analogy for the U.S.-China political-economic relationship. Economists have argued that the 2008 crisis was worsened by the fact that financial institutions, well aware of their systemic importance to the American economy, engaged in risky behavior because they knew they would likely be bailed out in the event of a crisis. Most importantly, those institutions believed that American lawmakers understood that it was not in their political interest to allow the banks to collapse.\nAn analogous problem arises from China\u2019s extensive economic ties with the U.S. (and other countries). If the Chinese government is aware that the relationship is perceived in Washington as \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d it might reason that it can get away with all sorts of egregious acts without suffering serious consequences. Deep economic ties with China increase the likelihood that American politicians will be unable or unwilling to let the relationship fail. In fact, this logic led China to incorrectly assume that President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war threats were merely bluffs. Beijing understood, for example, that a collapse in Chinese soybean purchases would directly harm the pocketbooks of Trump\u2019s base. It also knew that Fortune 500 companies would be extremely displeased. It therefore believed that it wasn\u2019t in Trump\u2019s political interest to risk the economic relationship.\nIn this way, economic engagement with China can be destabilizing, not to mention threatening to a variety of American interests, when it emboldens the worst tendencies of China\u2019s \u201cpresident for life.\u201d Of course, there have been times when Chinese and American actions have been restrained. For instance, China\u2019s military hawks have advocated, unsuccessfully, for Beijing to dump massive quantities of U.S. treasuries in response to American naval actions in China\u2019s backyard. Because the two nations are so economically interdependent, such a move would have caused too much damage to the Chinese economy.\nNonetheless, differences in domestic institutions have made this logic untenable under many circumstances. As an autocracy, the Chinese Communist Party is never beholden to domestic interest groups in the way that U.S. politicians typically are. For example, when China halted exports of rare earth minerals to Japan in 2010 following a dispute over the East China Sea, the Chinese Communist Party did not risk being voted out of office by its mining industry. But for the Japanese government, allowing the tech sector to come to a grinding halt as a result of losing that mineral supply would have been political suicide. Because economic independence constrained the Japanese government and not the Chinese government, Beijing prevailed. As China\u2019s economic relations with other nations grow, this problem will only get worse.\nWhile Trump\u2019s trade war may help course-correct the economic relationship, it will not eliminate this inherent vulnerability if it doesn\u2019t reduce economic ties between the two countries. If China\u2019s domestic institutions remain unchanged, the U.S. will be far more constrained by the relationship than China will ever be. Therefore, allowing \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d is unsafe for American interests.\nTo be sure, just because the U.S. should be concerned about a \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem doesn\u2019t mean it should let the relationship with China fail entirely or sever economic ties. That would be disastrous for all parties. But making it clear to China that the U.S. can reduce ties if necessary is a critical part of developing a healthier bilateral relationship. And given the nature of democratic institutions, the only way to reduce this vulnerability is to pursue more limited economic engagement with China.\nNew Zealand provides a disturbing example. As China\u2019s economic ties with New Zealand have expanded, Chinese behavior has grown more menacing. A 2018 report from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service details China\u2019s elaborate strategy in New Zealand to \u201cinfluence political decision-making, pursue unfair advantages in trade and business, suppress criticism of China, facilitate espionage opportunities, and influence overseas Chinese communities.\u201d\nThese programs have a long history in China. But President Xi Jinping, presiding over an era of unprecedented national economic prowess, has taken them to new extremes. For example, Anne-Marie Brady, a Chinese politics professor at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, was subjected to a year-long intimidation campaign that she said was orchestrated by the Chinese government. After publishing her research on Chinese influence operations abroad, her house was burglarized, her office was broken into twice, and her family car was sabotaged. She also received threatening letters and numerous phone calls in the middle of the night on her unlisted number. New Zealand has done little to counter these threats, likely due to fear of economic retaliation from the Chinese government. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern recently called her country\u2019s relationship with China \u201crobust and mature.\u201d\nChina\u2019s response to other nations\u2019 restrictions on Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, may foreshadow this. Beijing recently banned Australian coal imports, a move that was likely retaliation for Australia banning Huawei from its 5G networks. Similarly, after New Zealand restricted the use of Huawei equipment in its national 5G network, Beijing rescinded its invitation for Ardern to visit Beijing and called off the China-New Zealand Year of Tourism program.\nThe predatory nature of China\u2019s global economic ambitions should necessitate that the U.S. stop considering its relationship \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and encourage its allies to pursue more limited economic engagement. The Trump administration\u2019s inclination to insult our allies while showing bitter contempt for multilateralism will likely make this task more difficult, if not impossible for the foreseeable future. But if the U.S. fails, China\u2019s behavior is certain to get only worse in the future.\nNick Taber is an analyst of Chinese public policy.

That&rsquo;s made this author, at least, look excessively dismissive.</p>\n<p>What happened? First, Yang appeared on the <em>Joe Rogan Experience</em>. Other candidates might covet appearances on <i>The View </i>or profiles in <i>Vanity Fair </i>but the kickboxer cum stand-up comedian cum actor cum UFC commentator cum cheerful DMT evangelist&rsquo;s podcast rivals the reach of talk shows and dwarfs that of magazines. After Yang&rsquo;s appearance, interest in his campaign picked up.</p>\n<p>Yang had already gained admirers in the so-called Intellectual Dark Web for his focus on technological solutions for economic ills. He&rsquo;d been <a href=\"https://quillette.com/2018/10/06/a-new-kind-of-economy-an-interview-with-andrew-yang/\">interviewed by</a>, and had <a href=\"https://quillette.com/2018/12/14/video-games-and-the-male-meaning-of-life/\">written for</a>, the online magazine Quillette before his <em>Joe Rogan Experience</em> appearance. It was the podcast, however, that brought him to the attention of &ldquo;Frog Twitter.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>To steal a line from Christopher Hitchens, I risk immersing myself in a bog of embarrassment by trying to define Frog Twitter. Its inhabitants tend to be young, male, white, and nationalistic, but also less fixated on race than the alt-right and more cynical, literary, esoteric, and mischievous. They love to walk the line between satire and seriousness, to get a reaction as with other trolls, but also to deconstruct what they see as artificial forms of social meaning.</p>\n<p>Somehow, the frogs discovered a tweet in which Yang <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewYangVFA/status/1096442292527874048?s=19\">discussed</a> &ldquo;low birth rates and white men dying from substance abuse and suicide.&rdquo; It pleased them that a politician was discussing the troubles of white communities, and it tickled them that it was an Asian-American Democrat. &ldquo;How come <i>this guy</i> is talking about our issues and Trump isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; they asked among themselves.</p>\n<p>Many of those who energetically created pro-Trump memes in 2016 have since turned on their man. He has not built the wall, he is too attached to Israel, and it was more fun to support a rebel candidate than it has been to defend a sitting president. Depressed by the thought that even their supposedly radical outsider has become, in most substantive terms, a generic Republican, they have become more explicitly anti-political.</p>\n<p>Yang&rsquo;s campaign was built on his concern that increasing automation will eliminate jobs and drive Americans out of their economic and social spheres of life. He fears that if unemployment and underemployment spread, people will</p>\n<blockquote><p>degenerate into self-destructive and antisocial behaviors. You can see that in the surge of suicides among middle-aged Americans around the country that have brought down our country&rsquo;s life expectancy over the last two years&mdash;and the fact that eight Americans are dying of opiates every hour. </p></blockquote>\n<p>One of Yang&rsquo;s proposals to avert these trends is a &ldquo;Freedom Dividend&rdquo;&mdash;or what is more commonly referred to as Universal Basic Income&mdash;of a guaranteed $1,000 a month to every American. This policy proposal is what has truly excited the phenomenon known as the &ldquo;Yang Gang.&rdquo; If America is destined to decline, they&rsquo;ve concluded in a fit of cynical exuberance, they <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PressResetEarth/status/1106299016206270465?s=19\">might</a> as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YangGangGabu/status/1105712102784684032?s=19\">well</a> at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1103873831662309377\">least</a> get some money out of it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/practnational/status/1104127779879047168?s=19\">Some</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/practnational/status/1104128567548436481\">them</a> are a little more calculated, seeing the potential to take their thousand a month and spend more time on creative and social endeavors with less of a need to work. But most enjoy it as a funny, irreverent meme, raising a middle finger to the political establishment.</p>\n<p>Yang&rsquo;s face soon began to blossom across Twitter: new, warm, innocent, and, yes, generous. In my first article on Yang, I wrote that his campaign would suffer because he is uncharismatic. It is this lack of charisma that has made #yanggang memes so entertaining. The idea of this mild-mannered software nerd dancing with stacks of hundred dollar bills on the &ldquo;Yang Yacht&rdquo; is so absurd that it is genuinely funny. As other Democratic hopefuls play up their love of rap or youthful fondness for marijuana in a desperate attempt to get some cool kid credibility, casting Yang as some sort of playboy works, consciously or otherwise, as a satire on modern electoral campaigning.</p>\n<p>The idea that online memes got Trump elected was always an exaggeration. He had name recognition with the general public and a base that was hungry for his promises. Yang has neither, and thus his chances, while not nonexistent, remain minimal. Still, few though his admirers might be, their energy and creativity have thrust him onto the national stage. His campaign has earned enough <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewYangVFA/status/1106929319022977024\">donations</a>, seemingly overnight, for him to join seasoned candidates in the televised debates. &ldquo;You have to admit,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1105190523432779776\">tweeted</a> liberal pundit Matthew Yglesias, &ldquo;that &lsquo;Yang Gang&rsquo; is fun to say and write.&rdquo; Yang might not get elected, and his new fans might not end up happy even if he is, but their memes have changed the landscape of yet another election, creating a fresh platform for surreal and cynical humor.</p>\n<p>The irony is that as much as the success of #yanggang is predicated on anti-political satire, Yang&rsquo;s presence among the Democratic hopefuls might bring more political substance to the debates. Yang, who has pulled off a fairly nimble balancing act by embracing his newfound prominence while denouncing the racists among his admirers, has more interesting ideas than a Kamala Harris-esque cog in the D.C. machine or an astroturfed nonentity like Beto O&rsquo;Rourke. If he can direct Democratic discourse away from facile we&rsquo;re-not-Trumpism and towards more significant themes like automation and opioid deaths, that will itself be an achievement.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s staff, meanwhile, should be concerned about the loss of some of their more energetic and imaginative online supporters. No, Frog Twitter did not swing the 2016 presidential election. It is not as though Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh have hopped aboard the Yang Yacht. Still, the ability of young, scornful online memesters to sway media narratives, out of proportion with their numbers, had at least <i>some</i> effect in elevating and energizing Trump&rsquo;s campaign. Now, many of the same people are contrasting the old, slow, rusted Trump Train with the sleek, shiny, welcoming Yang Yacht. Quite apart from anything else, it&rsquo;s a chance to make newer, fresher jokes.

                "text": "The first time I wrote about 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, I said he \u201chas about as much chance of becoming the Democrat nominee as this author does of becoming the UFC Heavyweight Champion.\u201d And while Yang\u2019s chances of facing President Donald Trump in the general election are still slim, the betting lines have the tech millionaire and political newcomer ahead of Kirsten Gillibrand and just behind Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren. That\u2019s made this author, at least, look excessively dismissive.\nWhat happened? First, Yang appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience. Other candidates might covet appearances on The View or profiles in Vanity Fair but the kickboxer cum stand-up comedian cum actor cum UFC commentator cum cheerful DMT evangelist\u2019s podcast rivals the reach of talk shows and dwarfs that of magazines. After Yang\u2019s appearance, interest in his campaign picked up.\nYang had already gained admirers in the so-called Intellectual Dark Web for his focus on technological solutions for economic ills. He\u2019d been interviewed by, and had written for, the online magazine Quillette before his Joe Rogan Experience appearance. It was the podcast, however, that brought him to the attention of \u201cFrog Twitter.\u201d\nTo steal a line from Christopher Hitchens, I risk immersing myself in a bog of embarrassment by trying to define Frog Twitter. Its inhabitants tend to be young, male, white, and nationalistic, but also less fixated on race than the alt-right and more cynical, literary, esoteric, and mischievous. They love to walk the line between satire and seriousness, to get a reaction as with other trolls, but also to deconstruct what they see as artificial forms of social meaning.\nSomehow, the frogs discovered a tweet in which Yang discussed \u201clow birth rates and white men dying from substance abuse and suicide.\u201d It pleased them that a politician was discussing the troubles of white communities, and it tickled them that it was an Asian-American Democrat. \u201cHow come this guy is talking about our issues and Trump isn\u2019t?\u201d they asked among themselves.\nMany of those who energetically created pro-Trump memes in 2016 have since turned on their man. He has not built the wall, he is too attached to Israel, and it was more fun to support a rebel candidate than it has been to defend a sitting president. Depressed by the thought that even their supposedly radical outsider has become, in most substantive terms, a generic Republican, they have become more explicitly anti-political.\nYang\u2019s campaign was built on his concern that increasing automation will eliminate jobs and drive Americans out of their economic and social spheres of life. He fears that if unemployment and underemployment spread, people will\ndegenerate into self-destructive and antisocial behaviors. You can see that in the surge of suicides among middle-aged Americans around the country that have brought down our country\u2019s life expectancy over the last two years\u2014and the fact that eight Americans are dying of opiates every hour.\nOne of Yang\u2019s proposals to avert these trends is a \u201cFreedom Dividend\u201d\u2014or what is more commonly referred to as Universal Basic Income\u2014of a guaranteed $1,000 a month to every American. This policy proposal is what has truly excited the phenomenon known as the \u201cYang Gang.\u201d If America is destined to decline, they\u2019ve concluded in a fit of cynical exuberance, they might as well at least get some money out of it. Some of them are a little more calculated, seeing the potential to take their thousand a month and spend more time on creative and social endeavors with less of a need to work. But most enjoy it as a funny, irreverent meme, raising a middle finger to the political establishment.\nYang\u2019s face soon began to blossom across Twitter: new, warm, innocent, and, yes, generous. In my first article on Yang, I wrote that his campaign would suffer because he is uncharismatic. It is this lack of charisma that has made #yanggang memes so entertaining. The idea of this mild-mannered software nerd dancing with stacks of hundred dollar bills on the \u201cYang Yacht\u201d is so absurd that it is genuinely funny. As other Democratic hopefuls play up their love of rap or youthful fondness for marijuana in a desperate attempt to get some cool kid credibility, casting Yang as some sort of playboy works, consciously or otherwise, as a satire on modern electoral campaigning.\nThe idea that online memes got Trump elected was always an exaggeration. He had name recognition with the general public and a base that was hungry for his promises. Yang has neither, and thus his chances, while not nonexistent, remain minimal. Still, few though his admirers might be, their energy and creativity have thrust him onto the national stage. His campaign has earned enough donations, seemingly overnight, for him to join seasoned candidates in the televised debates. \u201cYou have to admit,\u201d tweeted liberal pundit Matthew Yglesias, \u201cthat \u2018Yang Gang\u2019 is fun to say and write.\u201d Yang might not get elected, and his new fans might not end up happy even if he is, but their memes have changed the landscape of yet another election, creating a fresh platform for surreal and cynical humor.\nThe irony is that as much as the success of #yanggang is predicated on anti-political satire, Yang\u2019s presence among the Democratic hopefuls might bring more political substance to the debates. Yang, who has pulled off a fairly nimble balancing act by embracing his newfound prominence while denouncing the racists among his admirers, has more interesting ideas than a Kamala Harris-esque cog in the D.C. machine or an astroturfed nonentity like Beto O\u2019Rourke. If he can direct Democratic discourse away from facile we\u2019re-not-Trumpism and towards more significant themes like automation and opioid deaths, that will itself be an achievement.\nDonald Trump\u2019s staff, meanwhile, should be concerned about the loss of some of their more energetic and imaginative online supporters. No, Frog Twitter did not swing the 2016 presidential election. It is not as though Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh have hopped aboard the Yang Yacht. Still, the ability of young, scornful online memesters to sway media narratives, out of proportion with their numbers, had at least some effect in elevating and energizing Trump\u2019s campaign. Now, many of the same people are contrasting the old, slow, rusted Trump Train with the sleek, shiny, welcoming Yang Yacht. Quite apart from anything else, it\u2019s a chance to make newer, fresher jokes. Old memes get stale, and Trump, who is still barking about witch hunts, binge-watching Fox News, and getting little done, should realize that he is in danger of becoming one.\nBen Sixsmith is a British writer living in Poland who has written for Quillette, the Spectator USA, the Catholic Herald, Public Discourse, and Unherd.\nLatest Articles",

Instead, the happy adulterous couple managed to find a spineless wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing of an evangelical pastor to whitewash their sepulcher for them by declaring their marriage to be &ldquo;God&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I was aghast. The marriage service, perhaps due to the officiant&rsquo;s awareness that significant &ldquo;impediments&rdquo; did exist, provided no opportunity for objections, but I had several. I knew, of course, that what 21st-century secular society calls marriage bears little resemblance to the Christian form of the institution, but never before had I seen such abject cowardice and accommodation on the part of a church.</p>\n<p>I thought immediately of Rod Dreher&rsquo;s <em>Benedict Option</em>, in which I&rsquo;d read that orthodox Christians have &ldquo;lost the public square.&rdquo; In post-<em>Obergefell </em>America, Dreher argues, those who would preserve Christian marriage must circle the wagons. There is no sense in continuing to wage a legal and cultural war over gay marriage when one wing of our army has defected to the enemy and the other has, through its lax attitude toward divorce, left its flank exposed.</p>\n<p>In light of such distortions and compromises, it becomes easy to look back with nostalgia on the 1940s and &rsquo;50s, when Christianity and its idea of marriage permeated secular society far more fully and sex had not yet been severed from reproduction by the birth control pill or reduced to a mere means of self-actualization by the Sexual Revolution.</p>\n<p>Yet even in 1943, in a radio broadcast that would later become a chapter in <em>Mere Christianity</em>, C.S. Lewis freely acknowledged the loss of the public square, especially on the subject of marriage. &ldquo;A great many people seem to think that if you are a Christian, you should try to make divorce very difficult for every one. I do not think that,&rdquo; he said, adding, &ldquo;My own view is that the Churches should frankly recognize that the majority of the British people are not Christians and, therefore, cannot be expected to live Christian lives.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dreher also acknowledges the futility of using state authority to cudgel non-believers into accepting Christian ethical standards with which they disagree. &ldquo;Political power,&rdquo; Dreher writes, &ldquo;is not a moral disinfectant.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lewis and Dreher also share, despite the temporal (and perhaps exaggerated) cultural gulf that separates them, a common strategy for the preservation of Christian marriage, with Lewis anticipating the Benedict Option by over half a century.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There ought to be,&rdquo; Lewis argues, &ldquo;two distinct kinds of marriage: one governed by the State with rules enforced on all citizens, the other governed by the Church with rules <em>enforced by her on her own members</em>.&rdquo; So far, so good. Dreher agrees and even praises a Baptist congregation that excommunicated a couple who insisted on divorcing. But although Lewis held no illusions about living in a Christian nation, he failed to foresee that the churches themselves would soon cease to be a safe harbor for Christian marriage. Lewis tells his audience that all major denominations &ldquo;regard divorce as something like cutting up a living body&rdquo; and that the main differences between denominations is that some (like the Roman Catholic Church in the days before its American branch <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/the-vaticans-new-policy-on-annulments-the-first-hint-of-shake-ups-to-come/404182/\">handed out annulments like candy</a>) say that &ldquo;it cannot be done at all&rdquo; while others &ldquo;admit it as a desperate remedy in extreme cases.&rdquo; He failed to foresee a world in which, even in his own Church of England, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/how-the-church-of-england-has-evolved-on-divorce-from-henry-viii-to-meghan-markle/2018/05/15/85ca3388-4d6c-11e8-85c1-9326c4511033_story.html?utm_term=.b812a6a22e71\">&ldquo;[t]he exceptional is now routine.&rdquo;</a> Today, as the wedding my fianc&eacute;e and I attended illustrates, no couple will have any trouble finding a minister to endorse the view that marriage is nothing more than what Lewis calls a &ldquo;simple readjustment of partners.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Of gay marriage, Lewis says nothing because such a concept was still largely unthinkable in his day. If half a century ago, the churches had taken his advice and maintained a more or less united front on the topic of divorce even in the teeth of liberalized family laws, we would, perhaps, never have been driven to the extremity of defending our churches, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-religion-lgbt-united-methodist/united-methodist-church-strengthens-ban-on-same-sex-marriage-lgbt-clergy-idUSKCN1QG022\">as the United Methodists were recently forced to do</a>, against the consecration of gay marriage. Appeasement will get us nowhere. When we fail to stand fast on the beaches and the landing grounds, we will be forced to fight in the streets, at which point the enemy will have penetrated so far into our territory that we would better serve our cause by taking to the hills to regroup.</p>\n<p>It may be tempting, especially for embattled Christians attempting to preserve their faith in a thoroughly post-Christian society, to look with rose-colored glasses on everything before the 1960s as an era of simple, universal piety. This attitude is evident in the creepy fetishization of the 1950s common in some Catholic Facebook groups. As Lewis reminds us, however, those decades were far from prelapsarian. Even in 1943, less than a decade after a firm defense of Christian marriage forced King Edward VIII from his throne and 75 years before the Archbishop of Canterbury would <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/royalwedding\">openly marry a royal prince to a divorc&eacute;e</a>, Lewis already perceived that Christians would soon lose control of the public sphere and would have to fortify themselves if they were to survive.</p>\n<p>Imagine if, instead of fighting a long and futile culture war that did lasting damage to the reputation of the Church, we had instead spent the latter half of the 20th century implementing the Dreher-Lewis vision of the Benedict Option. The flood might have come sooner, but our ark would not have been nearly as leaky as it is today.</p>\n<p><em>Grayson Quay is a freelance writer and M.A. student at Georgetown University.</em></p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://tempest.services.disqus.com/ads-iframe/google/?position=top&shortname=tac1&experiment=network_default&variant=fallthrough&service=dynamic&anchorColor=%23001c5e&colorScheme=light&sourceUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theamericanconservative.com%2Farticles%2Fc-s-lewiss-benedict-option%2F&typeface=sans-serif&canonicalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theamericanconservative.com%2Farticles%2Fc-s-lewiss-benedict-option%2F&disqus_version=b016541\"></iframe></figure>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=tac1&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theamericanconservative.com%2Farticles%2Fc-s-lewiss-benedict-option%2F&t_d=C.S.%20Lewis's%20Benedict%20Option%20%7C%20The%20American%20Conservative&t_t=C.S.%20Lewis's%20Benedict%20Option%20%7C%20The%20American%20Conservative&s_o=default#version=c9a88830014e14db1a266eb16c7bc97b\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "A few weeks ago, my fianc\u00e9e and I attended, against our will, the second wedding of a relative who had callously moved in with his much younger mistress while his abandoned wife grieved over a devastating family tragedy.\nAs a traditionalist Christian, I was obviously not excited about this wedding, but so long as they were married by a friend or justice of the peace, I figured I would have no problem keeping my mouth shut and enjoying the party. Instead, the happy adulterous couple managed to find a spineless wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing of an evangelical pastor to whitewash their sepulcher for them by declaring their marriage to be \u201cGod\u2019s will.\u201d\nI was aghast. The marriage service, perhaps due to the officiant\u2019s awareness that significant \u201cimpediments\u201d did exist, provided no opportunity for objections, but I had several. I knew, of course, that what 21st-century secular society calls marriage bears little resemblance to the Christian form of the institution, but never before had I seen such abject cowardice and accommodation on the part of a church.\nI thought immediately of Rod Dreher\u2019s Benedict Option, in which I\u2019d read that orthodox Christians have \u201clost the public square.\u201d In post-Obergefell America, Dreher argues, those who would preserve Christian marriage must circle the wagons. There is no sense in continuing to wage a legal and cultural war over gay marriage when one wing of our army has defected to the enemy and the other has, through its lax attitude toward divorce, left its flank exposed.\nIn light of such distortions and compromises, it becomes easy to look back with nostalgia on the 1940s and \u201950s, when Christianity and its idea of marriage permeated secular society far more fully and sex had not yet been severed from reproduction by the birth control pill or reduced to a mere means of self-actualization by the Sexual Revolution.\nYet even in 1943, in a radio broadcast that would later become a chapter in Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis freely acknowledged the loss of the public square, especially on the subject of marriage. \u201cA great many people seem to think that if you are a Christian, you should try to make divorce very difficult for every one. I do not think that,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMy own view is that the Churches should frankly recognize that the majority of the British people are not Christians and, therefore, cannot be expected to live Christian lives.\u201d\nDreher also acknowledges the futility of using state authority to cudgel non-believers into accepting Christian ethical standards with which they disagree. \u201cPolitical power,\u201d Dreher writes, \u201cis not a moral disinfectant.\u201d\nLewis and Dreher also share, despite the temporal (and perhaps exaggerated) cultural gulf that separates them, a common strategy for the preservation of Christian marriage, with Lewis anticipating the Benedict Option by over half a century.\n\u201cThere ought to be,\u201d Lewis argues, \u201ctwo distinct kinds of marriage: one governed by the State with rules enforced on all citizens, the other governed by the Church with rules enforced by her on her own members.\u201d So far, so good. Dreher agrees and even praises a Baptist congregation that excommunicated a couple who insisted on divorcing. But although Lewis held no illusions about living in a Christian nation, he failed to foresee that the churches themselves would soon cease to be a safe harbor for Christian marriage. Lewis tells his audience that all major denominations \u201cregard divorce as something like cutting up a living body\u201d and that the main differences between denominations is that some (like the Roman Catholic Church in the days before its American branch handed out annulments like candy) say that \u201cit cannot be done at all\u201d while others \u201cadmit it as a desperate remedy in extreme cases.\u201d He failed to foresee a world in which, even in his own Church of England, \u201c[t]he exceptional is now routine.\u201d Today, as the wedding my fianc\u00e9e and I attended illustrates, no couple will have any trouble finding a minister to endorse the view that marriage is nothing more than what Lewis calls a \u201csimple readjustment of partners.\u201d\nOf gay marriage, Lewis says nothing because such a concept was still largely unthinkable in his day. If half a century ago, the churches had taken his advice and maintained a more or less united front on the topic of divorce even in the teeth of liberalized family laws, we would, perhaps, never have been driven to the extremity of defending our churches, as the United Methodists were recently forced to do, against the consecration of gay marriage. Appeasement will get us nowhere. When we fail to stand fast on the beaches and the landing grounds, we will be forced to fight in the streets, at which point the enemy will have penetrated so far into our territory that we would better serve our cause by taking to the hills to regroup.\nIt may be tempting, especially for embattled Christians attempting to preserve their faith in a thoroughly post-Christian society, to look with rose-colored glasses on everything before the 1960s as an era of simple, universal piety. This attitude is evident in the creepy fetishization of the 1950s common in some Catholic Facebook groups. As Lewis reminds us, however, those decades were far from prelapsarian. Even in 1943, less than a decade after a firm defense of Christian marriage forced King Edward VIII from his throne and 75 years before the Archbishop of Canterbury would openly marry a royal prince to a divorc\u00e9e, Lewis already perceived that Christians would soon lose control of the public sphere and would have to fortify themselves if they were to survive.\nImagine if, instead of fighting a long and futile culture war that did lasting damage to the reputation of the Church, we had instead spent the latter half of the 20th century implementing the Dreher-Lewis vision of the Benedict Option. The flood might have come sooner, but our ark would not have been nearly as leaky as it is today.\nGrayson Quay is a freelance writer and M.A. student at Georgetown University.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Tucker Carlson. If one of those names on a list of examples of ascendant socialism strikes you as out of place, you may have missed weeks of debate on the Right over a reasonable comment made by the popular Fox News host.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster,&rdquo; Carlson said. &ldquo;Any economic system that weakens and destroys families isn&rsquo;t worth having.&rdquo; Does this observation make Tucker a socialist? Hardly. As is often the case, <i>TAC</i> founding editor Patrick J. Buchanan was more than a decade ahead of the curve.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To me, the country comes before the economy; and the economy exists for the people,&rdquo; Buchanan said in a 1998 speech to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. &ldquo;I believe in free markets, but I do not worship them. In the proper hierarchy of things, it is the market that must be harnessed to work for man&mdash;and not the other way around.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In practice, conservatives often have worshiped free markets. As John Zmirak argued in these pages in 2003, the need to come up with a universal ideology that could compete with Marxism led some Cold War conservatives to lose the plot. The early neoconservatives and their forebears, he writes, &ldquo;brought with them vast talents, literary learning, and serious moral concern for universal issues of human rights. But they also carried a strong tendency towards pure abstraction, towards viewing national questions purely in ideological terms.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The end result was they often &ldquo;defended America bravely during the Cold War&mdash;but they did so not as our homeland, as the particular place where a people and their treasured institutions took root, but rather as the (almost accidental) spot where certain ideas had taken hold.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Similarly, the &ldquo;fusionist&rdquo; conception of conservatism propounded by <i>National Review</i> senior editor Frank Meyer sought to use libertarian means to achieve traditionalist ends. Some conservatives have misconstrued that as a decree that libertarian means will <i>necessarily</i> achieve traditionalist ends.</p>\n<p>We know that to not be the case. Free markets can be corrosive of other values or priorities that are important to authentic conservatives: family, faith, and community. We see major corporations promoting social and cultural liberalism, social media monopolies&mdash;all privately owned&mdash;de-platforming conservatives and suppressing their ideas, big business and big government working hand in hand against religion and tradition.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In states such as Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky, countless children are growing up with parents in jail, incapacitated, or underground,&rdquo; writes J.D. Vance in Meyer&rsquo;s publication. &ldquo;Yes, they live in a country with a higher GDP than a generation ago, and they&rsquo;re undoubtedly able to buy cheaper consumer goods, but to paraphrase Reagan: Are they better off than they were 20 years ago?&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px\" src=\"https://2qkhyt1u78lw1ll02a1kxrzq-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/this-article-appears-Mar_Apr-2019.png\" srcset=\"https://2qkhyt1u78lw1ll02a1kxrzq-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/this-article-appears-Mar_Apr-2019.png 184w, https://2qkhyt1u78lw1ll02a1kxrzq-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/this-article-appears-Mar_Apr-2019-46x70.png 46w\"></img></figure>\n<p>Among conservatives, there has been a course correction. Since the election of Donald Trump, a Republican president who divides conservatives, more people on the Right speak of the United States as a homeland rather than a mere abstraction. The global economy and mass immigration are being subjected to cost-benefit analysis, as champions of the marketplace should have it. There is more of a willingness to contest the idea that what&rsquo;s good for General Motors is good for conservatives&mdash;or America.</p>\n<p>Maybe conservatives will overcorrect, putting too much faith in government, even at the local level, at the expense of free markets. But fusionists once understood that liberty and virtue, individualism and tradition, are to some extent in tension. Efforts to manage that balance are necessary but will not always produce a perfect synthesis, a straight line from low marginal tax rates to intact families.</p>\n<p>The periodic electoral successes conservatives have enjoyed since the 1980s have caused us to lose sight of an important question: what is it that we are trying to conserve? The search for answers is finally ready for primetime.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://tempest.services.disqus.com/ads-iframe/google/?position=top&shortname=tac1&experiment=network_default&variant=fallthrough&service=dynamic&anchorColor=%23001c5e&colorScheme=light&sourceUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theamericanconservative.com%2Farticles%2Fcapitalist-tool%2F&typeface=sans-serif&canonicalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theamericanconservative.com%2Farticles%2Fcapitalist-tool%2F&disqus_version=b016541\"></iframe></figure>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=tac1&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theamericanconservative.com%2Farticles%2Fcapitalist-tool%2F&t_d=Capitalist%20Tool%20%7C%20The%20American%20Conservative&t_t=Capitalist%20Tool%20%7C%20The%20American%20Conservative&s_o=default#version=c9a88830014e14db1a266eb16c7bc97b\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This editorial was published in the March/April issue of the magazine.\nBernie Sanders. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Tucker Carlson. If one of those names on a list of examples of ascendant socialism strikes you as out of place, you may have missed weeks of debate on the Right over a reasonable comment made by the popular Fox News host.\n\u201cMarket capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cAny economic system that weakens and destroys families isn\u2019t worth having.\u201d Does this observation make Tucker a socialist? Hardly. As is often the case, TAC founding editor Patrick J. Buchanan was more than a decade ahead of the curve.\n\u201cTo me, the country comes before the economy; and the economy exists for the people,\u201d Buchanan said in a 1998 speech to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cI believe in free markets, but I do not worship them. In the proper hierarchy of things, it is the market that must be harnessed to work for man\u2014and not the other way around.\u201d\nIn practice, conservatives often have worshiped free markets. As John Zmirak argued in these pages in 2003, the need to come up with a universal ideology that could compete with Marxism led some Cold War conservatives to lose the plot. The early neoconservatives and their forebears, he writes, \u201cbrought with them vast talents, literary learning, and serious moral concern for universal issues of human rights. But they also carried a strong tendency towards pure abstraction, towards viewing national questions purely in ideological terms.\u201d\nThe end result was they often \u201cdefended America bravely during the Cold War\u2014but they did so not as our homeland, as the particular place where a people and their treasured institutions took root, but rather as the (almost accidental) spot where certain ideas had taken hold.\u201d\nSimilarly, the \u201cfusionist\u201d conception of conservatism propounded by National Review senior editor Frank Meyer sought to use libertarian means to achieve traditionalist ends. Some conservatives have misconstrued that as a decree that libertarian means will necessarily achieve traditionalist ends.\nWe know that to not be the case. Free markets can be corrosive of other values or priorities that are important to authentic conservatives: family, faith, and community. We see major corporations promoting social and cultural liberalism, social media monopolies\u2014all privately owned\u2014de-platforming conservatives and suppressing their ideas, big business and big government working hand in hand against religion and tradition.\n\u201cIn states such as Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky, countless children are growing up with parents in jail, incapacitated, or underground,\u201d writes J.D. Vance in Meyer\u2019s publication. \u201cYes, they live in a country with a higher GDP than a generation ago, and they\u2019re undoubtedly able to buy cheaper consumer goods, but to paraphrase Reagan: Are they better off than they were 20 years ago?\u201d\nAmong conservatives, there has been a course correction. Since the election of Donald Trump, a Republican president who divides conservatives, more people on the Right speak of the United States as a homeland rather than a mere abstraction. The global economy and mass immigration are being subjected to cost-benefit analysis, as champions of the marketplace should have it. There is more of a willingness to contest the idea that what\u2019s good for General Motors is good for conservatives\u2014or America.\nMaybe conservatives will overcorrect, putting too much faith in government, even at the local level, at the expense of free markets. But fusionists once understood that liberty and virtue, individualism and tradition, are to some extent in tension. Efforts to manage that balance are necessary but will not always produce a perfect synthesis, a straight line from low marginal tax rates to intact families.\nThe periodic electoral successes conservatives have enjoyed since the 1980s have caused us to lose sight of an important question: what is it that we are trying to conserve? The search for answers is finally ready for primetime.",

But his court-packing scheme proved a nightmare. His bill never received a Senate vote. Democrats lost seats during the 1938 midterms. His popularity plunged. The plan was correctly perceived by the American people as undermining an independent judiciary, a cornerstone of the separation of powers.

Popular opinion ultimately had its way.</p>\n<p>Despite the lamp of experience, however, Democrats are absurdly crusading for court-packing to alter decisions rendered and anticipated by the Supreme Court under the stewardship of Chief Justice John Roberts. Court-packing would transform constitutional law into a jumble of political calculations with ulterior motives. It would shake public confidence in the administration of justice and cripple separation of powers&mdash;a structural Bill of Rights&mdash;by making the Supreme Court an appendage of the political branches. Moreover, the public is unconvinced of the wisdom of court-packing. At present, it holds the Supreme Court in higher regard than either the presidency or Congress.</p>\n<p>The Constitution is silent on the number of Supreme Court justices. The Judiciary Act of 1789 fixed the number at six. As the nation expanded, the number climbed by statute to 10 under President Abraham Lincoln. The Radical Reconstruction Congress lowered the number to seven to foreclose any appointments by President Andrew Johnson. In 1869, Congress jumped the number to nine under Johnson&rsquo;s successor, President Ulysses S. Grant, to reverse a decision adverse to legal tender laws. The number nine has remained unchanged for 150 years, which crowns it with quasi-constitutional status.</p>\n<p>Democrats are losing the Supreme Court because their ideas are unpopular, not because of the number of justices. Should they prevail with the public, the Supreme Court won&rsquo;t be far behind. Peter Finley Dunne&rsquo;s Mr. Dooley presciently observed more than a century ago regarding a fighting issue of that day, &ldquo;No matther whether th&rsquo; constitution follows h&rsquo; flag or not, th&rsquo; Supreme Coort follows th&rsquo; election returns.&rdquo; He was right.</p>\n<p><i>Bruce Fein was associate deputy attorney general and general counsel of the Federal Communications Commission under President Reagan and counsel to the Joint Congressional Committee on Covert Arms Sales to Iran.

Should they prevail with the public, the Supreme Court won\u2019t be far behind. Peter Finley Dunne\u2019s Mr. Dooley presciently observed more than a century ago regarding a fighting issue of that day, \u201cNo matther whether th\u2019 constitution follows h\u2019 flag or not, th\u2019 Supreme Coort follows th\u2019 election returns.\u201d He was right.\nBruce Fein was associate deputy attorney general and general counsel of the Federal Communications Commission under President Reagan and counsel to the Joint Congressional Committee on Covert Arms Sales to Iran. He is a partner in the law firm of Fein & DelValle PLLC.",

The idea is that the American people simply aren&rsquo;t prepared to follow the Democrats into the leftist territory that seems to be their nesting place these days. Ergo, the party is in the process of ceding the White House to the incumbent Republicans, meaning a likely Trump reelection triumph.</p>\n<p>This may be comforting to conservatives, but it is based on faulty political analysis. There is a strong prospect that 2020 will see the emergence of a new leftist president who represents democratic socialism of the European style&mdash;a brand of politics eschewed by America since at least the end of World War II.</p>\n<p>This perception is based on four broad political axioms worth exploring as the 2020 presidential spectacle gets under way.</p>\n<p><b>Axiom 1: Presidential elections are largely referendums on the incumbent or incumbent party. </b>In my 2012 book, <i>Where They Stand: The American Presidents in the Eyes of Voters and Historians</i>, I posited that if the incumbent&rsquo;s record is adjudged by the electorate to be exemplary, it doesn&rsquo;t matter much who the challenger is or what he or she says or does. The incumbent will win. If that record is perceived as unacceptable, then again it doesn&rsquo;t much matter who the challenger is or what he or she says or does. The incumbent or incumbent party will lose.</p>\n<p>Of course, referendum politics shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed as the be-all end-all of every presidential election. Other factors come into play&mdash;the character of the candidates, the record of the challenger, the issues being joined, the relative likability of the combatants. But incumbency performance is by far the most compelling factor. In <i>Where They Stand</i>, I noted the analytical framework for predicting presidential elections laid down by Allan J. Lichtman and Ken DeCell in their 1990 book, <i>The 13 Keys to the Presidency.</i> I also used that framework in the summer of 2016 in suggesting that, contrary to nearly all conventional wisdom at the time, Trump&rsquo;s chances were being underestimated. &ldquo;Trump,&rdquo; I wrote, &ldquo;actually can win.&rdquo; I based that on what I adjudged to be Barack Obama&rsquo;s failed second term, characterized by &ldquo;a stalled domestic program, Mideast chaos, the ISIS threat, growing Islamist terrorism at home, intraparty frictions, and a lingering scandal&rdquo; involving former secretary of state Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s private email server. Based on how the electorate had reacted to such lapses through history, I concluded that the Lichtman-DeCell keys pointed to a Trump victory.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the 2020 fate of Trump and his party will be driven far more by the president&rsquo;s performance than by the advocacy&mdash;even very liberal advocacy&mdash;of the challenger.</p>\n<p><b>Axiom 2: In politically unsettled times, such as we&rsquo;re experiencing today, the nation often opts for experimentation</b>.</p>\n<p>If Trump&rsquo;s presidency is the product of referendum politics, then it also is a product of the country&rsquo;s willingness to try new things when the political class screws up. Hardly anyone thought Trump could be elected because few analysts sufficiently took into account the degree of ennui and anxiety in the land. But to many Americans, that ennui and anxiety rendered thinkable the prospect of a Trump presidency, whereas in normal times his boorishness and repellent traits would have made him entirely unthinkable as a president.</p>\n<p>The campaign of 1980 was also waged in unsettled times, with raging inflation mixed with economic stagnation, sky-high interest rates, and fears of Soviet expansionism. Yet the conventional wisdom was that incumbent Jimmy Carter would likely win reelection because challenger Ronald Reagan was just too erratic, too extreme in his conservative views, and too much of a lightweight. But Reagan won big, not because the electorate suddenly turned conservative in its collective political outlook, but because the incumbent had squandered his claim to the job and because unsettled times called for trying new things, meaning a new president.</p>\n<p>Or consider the 1850s, when the slavery issue roiled the nation and raised questions as to whether the matter could be settled short of war (of course it couldn&rsquo;t be). During those turbulent times, the country witnessed the demise of the previously powerful Whig Party, the emergence of the replacement Republicans, a seemingly hopeless split within the Democratic Party, and the 1860 victory of Abraham Lincoln under the banner of a party that hadn&rsquo;t existed eight years before. None of this was even remotely predictable. Similarly, during the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt captured the presidency for the Democrats after the GOP had maintained a hold on the office for 56 of the previous 72 years. One of FDR&rsquo;s recurrent campaign themes was the need for governmental experimentation in a time of economic crisis. This represented a case study in referendum politics mixed with a widespread national desire for change.</p>\n<p><b>Axiom 3: Socialism is on the rise in America</b>.</p>\n<p>Much has been written of late about rising &ldquo;inequality&rdquo; in the country. A lot of it has been tendentious, but there is a growing perception that the country&rsquo;s elites have fostered policies from which they have massively benefitted while leaving the middle class in a state of economic decline. This perception happens to be correct, and it is the single largest factor driving American politics today. It elevated Trump to the White House.</p>\n<p>But if Trump fails (a distinct possibility, based on what we see of his governing style), the resulting increase in civic anxiety and a natural desire for experimentation could drive the country to the left. That is precisely what Democrats are banking on.</p>\n<p>They note, for example, the recent SurveyMonkey poll conducted for <i>The New York Times</i>, which indicated that 62 percent of respondents want the government to take actions to reduce the wealth gap. As two<i> Times </i>reporters put it, &ldquo;Nearly two-thirds of Democrats say it is immoral to have an economic system where some people have billions of dollars while others have very little.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The poll also indicated significant support for Democratic policies that many conservatives consider beyond the political pale. Fully 61 percent, for example, support a 2 percent tax on net wealth above $50 million (advocated by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren) and a 70 percent marginal rate on annual incomes above $10 million (hobby horse of fledgling phenom Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). The poll didn&rsquo;t ask about the so-called Green New Deal, another massive governmental expansion proposal put forth by Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, but no doubt there is substantial support for it on the left.</p>\n<p>Much has been written also about the political outlook of the Millennial generation, those born between 1981 and 1996. The Pew Research Center, after extensive surveys of these younger Americans, characterized their outlook as &ldquo;distinct&mdash;and increasingly liberal.&rdquo; Among them, Trump&rsquo;s approval rating, according to a poll conducted last year, was only 27 percent.</p>\n<p>All this suggests that we shouldn&rsquo;t discount the possibility of a national lurch to the left, particularly in light of the final axiom.</p>\n<p><b>Axiom 4: In today&rsquo;s divided America, political decision making resides on a knife&rsquo;s edge of parity. </b></p>\n<p>Trump won the presidency in 2016 by collecting just enough votes in just the right states to cadge an Electoral College victory. That means we&rsquo;re operating these days on the margin of politics. Even quite small swings in just a few states could turn the next election against him. And Trump, with his lack of success so far in expanding his base beyond his current 39 to 43 percent approval level, doesn&rsquo;t project the kind of political force that would make him a strong reelection candidate.</p>\n<p>None of this is a prediction. A lot could happen over the next two years. But the idea that the Democrats are killing their prospects for 2020 by lurching leftward isn&rsquo;t based on sound analytical thinking. The four axioms above suggest that the dynamics of American politics are more complex than that.</p>\n<p>So it&rsquo;s possible that the country could get, for the first time in its history, an experiment in socialist governance, mixed with a far-left push on high-voltage social issues such as immigration, political correctness, and racial politics. That would be a recipe for failure, leaving the country even more desperate for political leadership to restore stability.</p>\n<p><i>Robert W.

                "text": "Lately we have seen numerous conservative commentators posit the thesis that the Democrats are disqualifying themselves from a 2020 presidential victory by lurching too far left on key economic and social issues. The idea is that the American people simply aren\u2019t prepared to follow the Democrats into the leftist territory that seems to be their nesting place these days. Ergo, the party is in the process of ceding the White House to the incumbent Republicans, meaning a likely Trump reelection triumph.\nThis may be comforting to conservatives, but it is based on faulty political analysis. There is a strong prospect that 2020 will see the emergence of a new leftist president who represents democratic socialism of the European style\u2014a brand of politics eschewed by America since at least the end of World War II.\nThis perception is based on four broad political axioms worth exploring as the 2020 presidential spectacle gets under way.\nAxiom 1: Presidential elections are largely referendums on the incumbent or incumbent party. In my 2012 book, Where They Stand: The American Presidents in the Eyes of Voters and Historians, I posited that if the incumbent\u2019s record is adjudged by the electorate to be exemplary, it doesn\u2019t matter much who the challenger is or what he or she says or does. The incumbent will win. If that record is perceived as unacceptable, then again it doesn\u2019t much matter who the challenger is or what he or she says or does. The incumbent or incumbent party will lose.\nOf course, referendum politics shouldn\u2019t be viewed as the be-all end-all of every presidential election. Other factors come into play\u2014the character of the candidates, the record of the challenger, the issues being joined, the relative likability of the combatants. But incumbency performance is by far the most compelling factor. In Where They Stand, I noted the analytical framework for predicting presidential elections laid down by Allan J. Lichtman and Ken DeCell in their 1990 book, The 13 Keys to the Presidency. I also used that framework in the summer of 2016 in suggesting that, contrary to nearly all conventional wisdom at the time, Trump\u2019s chances were being underestimated. \u201cTrump,\u201d I wrote, \u201cactually can win.\u201d I based that on what I adjudged to be Barack Obama\u2019s failed second term, characterized by \u201ca stalled domestic program, Mideast chaos, the ISIS threat, growing Islamist terrorism at home, intraparty frictions, and a lingering scandal\u201d involving former secretary of state Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. Based on how the electorate had reacted to such lapses through history, I concluded that the Lichtman-DeCell keys pointed to a Trump victory.\nSimilarly, the 2020 fate of Trump and his party will be driven far more by the president\u2019s performance than by the advocacy\u2014even very liberal advocacy\u2014of the challenger.\nAxiom 2: In politically unsettled times, such as we\u2019re experiencing today, the nation often opts for experimentation.\nIf Trump\u2019s presidency is the product of referendum politics, then it also is a product of the country\u2019s willingness to try new things when the political class screws up. Hardly anyone thought Trump could be elected because few analysts sufficiently took into account the degree of ennui and anxiety in the land. But to many Americans, that ennui and anxiety rendered thinkable the prospect of a Trump presidency, whereas in normal times his boorishness and repellent traits would have made him entirely unthinkable as a president.\nThe campaign of 1980 was also waged in unsettled times, with raging inflation mixed with economic stagnation, sky-high interest rates, and fears of Soviet expansionism. Yet the conventional wisdom was that incumbent Jimmy Carter would likely win reelection because challenger Ronald Reagan was just too erratic, too extreme in his conservative views, and too much of a lightweight. But Reagan won big, not because the electorate suddenly turned conservative in its collective political outlook, but because the incumbent had squandered his claim to the job and because unsettled times called for trying new things, meaning a new president.\nOr consider the 1850s, when the slavery issue roiled the nation and raised questions as to whether the matter could be settled short of war (of course it couldn\u2019t be). During those turbulent times, the country witnessed the demise of the previously powerful Whig Party, the emergence of the replacement Republicans, a seemingly hopeless split within the Democratic Party, and the 1860 victory of Abraham Lincoln under the banner of a party that hadn\u2019t existed eight years before. None of this was even remotely predictable. Similarly, during the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt captured the presidency for the Democrats after the GOP had maintained a hold on the office for 56 of the previous 72 years. One of FDR\u2019s recurrent campaign themes was the need for governmental experimentation in a time of economic crisis. This represented a case study in referendum politics mixed with a widespread national desire for change.\nAxiom 3: Socialism is on the rise in America.\nMuch has been written of late about rising \u201cinequality\u201d in the country. A lot of it has been tendentious, but there is a growing perception that the country\u2019s elites have fostered policies from which they have massively benefitted while leaving the middle class in a state of economic decline. This perception happens to be correct, and it is the single largest factor driving American politics today. It elevated Trump to the White House.\nBut if Trump fails (a distinct possibility, based on what we see of his governing style), the resulting increase in civic anxiety and a natural desire for experimentation could drive the country to the left. That is precisely what Democrats are banking on.\nThey note, for example, the recent SurveyMonkey poll conducted for The New York Times, which indicated that 62 percent of respondents want the government to take actions to reduce the wealth gap. As two Times reporters put it, \u201cNearly two-thirds of Democrats say it is immoral to have an economic system where some people have billions of dollars while others have very little.\u201d\nThe poll also indicated significant support for Democratic policies that many conservatives consider beyond the political pale. Fully 61 percent, for example, support a 2 percent tax on net wealth above $50 million (advocated by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren) and a 70 percent marginal rate on annual incomes above $10 million (hobby horse of fledgling phenom Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). The poll didn\u2019t ask about the so-called Green New Deal, another massive governmental expansion proposal put forth by Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, but no doubt there is substantial support for it on the left.\nMuch has been written also about the political outlook of the Millennial generation, those born between 1981 and 1996. The Pew Research Center, after extensive surveys of these younger Americans, characterized their outlook as \u201cdistinct\u2014and increasingly liberal.\u201d Among them, Trump\u2019s approval rating, according to a poll conducted last year, was only 27 percent.\nAll this suggests that we shouldn\u2019t discount the possibility of a national lurch to the left, particularly in light of the final axiom.\nAxiom 4: In today\u2019s divided America, political decision making resides on a knife\u2019s edge of parity.\nTrump won the presidency in 2016 by collecting just enough votes in just the right states to cadge an Electoral College victory. That means we\u2019re operating these days on the margin of politics. Even quite small swings in just a few states could turn the next election against him. And Trump, with his lack of success so far in expanding his base beyond his current 39 to 43 percent approval level, doesn\u2019t project the kind of political force that would make him a strong reelection candidate.\nNone of this is a prediction. A lot could happen over the next two years. But the idea that the Democrats are killing their prospects for 2020 by lurching leftward isn\u2019t based on sound analytical thinking. The four axioms above suggest that the dynamics of American politics are more complex than that.\nSo it\u2019s possible that the country could get, for the first time in its history, an experiment in socialist governance, mixed with a far-left push on high-voltage social issues such as immigration, political correctness, and racial politics. That would be a recipe for failure, leaving the country even more desperate for political leadership to restore stability.\nRobert W.

His world-weary answer: &ldquo;Events, dear boy, events.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s some question as to whether or not Macmillan really said those words, but there&rsquo;s no question that he&mdash;and everyone else, in politics or not, who has ever had a plan&mdash;knows the feeling. <em>As much as we hope to ride events, events have a way of riding us. </em></p>\n<p>Today, unforeseen events are once again in the saddle, and the Democrats&rsquo; plan for the orderly defenestration of President Donald Trump has been disordered. They&rsquo;d hoped for a campaign based on defending Obamacare (now a <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/obama_and_democrats_health_care_plan-1130.html\">positive</a> for them), prosecuting the Russia connection (such as it might prove to be), and scourging Trump himself (his aggregated <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html\">approval rating</a>, while up in recent weeks, is still well below 50 percent).</p>\n<p>Then came&hellip;events. Events, that is, that threatened the Democrats&rsquo; ascendance.</p>\n<p>The first event was the rise of democratic socialism, including its lefty offshoots, Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. These positions have been boosted by the hipster glamor of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, yet upon inspection, they&rsquo;ve proven unpopular with those drab folks in the middle. Indeed, mindful of the danger that such radical ideas pose to the Democrats&rsquo; chances in 2020, establishmentarian Dems, urged on by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have worked assiduously and effectively to torpedo <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/02/pelosi-medicare-for-all-131116\">both</a> of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/07/politics/pelosi-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal/index.html\">them</a>.</p>\n<p>The second event has proven, at least so far, to be less manageable. That&rsquo;s the sudden prominence of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, the newbie lawmaker from Somalia by way of Minneapolis. Her words&mdash;from &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2019/02/26/ilhan-omar-deletes-israel-tweets-that-drew-charges-of-anti-semitism/2989404002/\">it&rsquo;s all about the Benjamins, baby</a>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSTNnKNFS0o&feature=youtu.be\">some people did something</a>&ldquo;&mdash;are now riding roughshod over Democrats&rsquo; 2020 plan.</p>\n<p>Once again, Pelosi has been doing her best to get the party back on track. On Sunday night&rsquo;s edition of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/speaker-of-the-house-nancy-pelosi-the-2019-60-minutes-interview-2019-04-14/\"><em>60 Minutes</em></a>, the House speaker again minimized the new lefties, dismissing AOC, Omar, et al., with a terse, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like five people.&rdquo; Mindful of her Democratic colleagues seeking to win in red and purple districts next year, Pelosi added, &ldquo;We have to hold the center&hellip;we have to&hellip;go down the mainstream.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s some valiant spin, but the White House wasn&rsquo;t having it. The next morning, <em>The New York</em> Times&rsquo;s Maggie Haberman, perhaps the Fourth Estate&rsquo;s leading Trumpologist, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/us/politics/ilhan-omar-trump-muslims-2020.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">reported</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s advisers describe Ms. Omar as his ideal foil. Her remarks about the power of the pro-Israel lobby in the United States, combined with her role in a progressive contingent of freshman House Democrats who have sparked intraparty battles, have been treated as a gift by Republicans.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In fact, within hours, Trump himself had vindicated Haberman&rsquo;s reporting. Never one to leave a flame unfanned&mdash;and eager to burn Pelosi, too&mdash;Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1117782316557000704\">tweeted</a>:</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p>Before Nancy, who has lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done, decides to defend her leader, Rep. Omar, she should look at the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements Omar has made. She is out of control, except for her control of Nancy!</p><p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1117782316557000704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 15, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>So now, with Trump in the mosh pit, it&rsquo;s a free-for-all, as partisan pugilists on both sides have gone diving in. Pelosi blasted Trump for supposedly threatening Omar, suggesting that the embattled lawmaker would soon be receiving <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1117499876328267787\">protection</a> from the Capitol Police. In point of fact, Trump didn&rsquo;t do anything more than quote Omar, but now Pelosi has now set up a predicate of blame in case something does happen.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, in the midst of the melee, rogue Republican David Frum&mdash;who never lost his pragmatic perspective, even as he went to the far end of Never Trumpism&mdash;warned his new allies on the Left to cool it. The <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/trumps-attack-ilhan-omar-trap-democrats/587128/\">headline</a> atop his <em>Atlantic </em>piece reads, &ldquo;Democrats Are Falling Into the Ilhan Omar Trap: By rushing to stand with the controversial congresswoman, the 2020 contenders are allowing Trump to transform her into the face of their party.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Heeding such warnings, many Democrats would obviously rather <em>not</em> be talking about Omar, 9/11, and all that. As another <em>Times</em> reporter, Astead Herndon, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/us/politics/trump-ilhan-omar-911.html\">explained</a>, the more cautious 2020 presidential hopefuls are trying to stay in the safe zone: &ldquo;Candidates who have tried to position themselves as pragmatic options to a party lurching to the left&hellip;tried to refocus the incident to highlight the need to unify the country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Yet Trump and Trumpy Republicans, hoping for a replay of GOP successes in the 2002 and 2004 elections, are determined to keep the focus on Omar&mdash;and to pin every Democrat to her.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, reporters and other diggers will be going through everything she has ever said or done, even as they pump her for her latest hot-take opinions. Will Omar be able to resist the temptation to tell her side of the story? And to share her perspective on world events? After all, she&rsquo;s now a hero in some circles, having raised an <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ilhan-omar-raises-nearly-1m-anti-semitic-controversies-beats-progressive-dems-like-ocasio-cortez-tlaib\">astonishing amount of money</a> for a freshman. And it&rsquo;s the rare politician who consistently declines to comment on heartfelt concerns.</p>\n<p>Yet for the larger sake of their party, Democrats will need an <em>event</em> of their own making. You know, like the 1992 Sister Souljah Moment.</p>\n<p>Back in May 1992, a rapper named Sister Souljah offered an opinion that understandably upset Middle America: &ldquo;If black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?&rdquo; A few weeks later, <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4460582/sister-souljah-moment\">Bill Clinton</a>, on his way to the Democratic presidential nomination&mdash;and seeking votes in the heartland&mdash;criticized Ms. Souljah at a meeting of Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s Rainbow Coalition. &ldquo;If you took the words &lsquo;white&rsquo; and &lsquo;black&rsquo; and reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech,&rdquo; Clinton said. &ldquo;We have an obligation, all of us, to call attention to prejudice whenever we see it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Clinton had a point, of course, and yet the impact of a white man criticizing a black woman at a black event was thunderous. He had indeed demonstrated that he was a different kind of Democrat. Later that year, columnist <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1992-10-28-9204070622-story.html\">Clarence Page</a> called Clinton&rsquo;s words &ldquo;the most important moment in the 1992 presidential race.&rdquo; Clinton won the &rsquo;92 election by a wide margin, thereby snapping the Democrats&rsquo; string of three consecutive landslide losses.</p>\n<p>As a political stroke, the &ldquo;Sister Souljah Moment,&rdquo; defined as confounding the stereotype of one&rsquo;s own party&mdash;whether out of courage, calculation, or both&mdash;is so effective that it even has its own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Souljah_moment\">Wikipedia</a> page.</p>\n<p>So will the Democrats do it again? Will they give Omar the &ldquo;Sister Souljah&rdquo; treatment? If she keeps talking, they&rsquo;ll have to&mdash;if they want to hold any hope of winning next year.</p>\n<p>In the short run, it&rsquo;s unlikely that any presidential Democrat will dare to attack Omar, because none of the White House wannabes wish to incur the wrath of the &ldquo;woke&rdquo; primary electorate. Indeed, even Clinton made his move only after he had secured the Democratic nomination, when left-wing activists mattered less.</p>\n<p>Yet the 2020 general election is a long way away. Assuming that Omar is still in the news, there will be plenty of time for the party&rsquo;s eventual nominee to make it clear that Omar doesn&rsquo;t speak for him, or her.</p>\n<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that even then the Democratic nominee will take on Omar. Nor is there a guarantee that the nominee will deliver the message as effectively as Clinton did&mdash;or that the media will play along, as it did back in &rsquo;92.</p>\n<p>But if the Democrats can&rsquo;t find a way to do this distancing, then put it in the bank: Trump and his helpers will force an event of their own. They&rsquo;ll make it appear that Omar, along with her ideology, is on the Democrats&rsquo; national ticket.</p>\n<p><em>James P.

                "text": "Former British prime minister Harold Macmillan was once asked what could happen that might change the direction of his government. His world-weary answer: \u201cEvents, dear boy, events.\u201d\nActually, there\u2019s some question as to whether or not Macmillan really said those words, but there\u2019s no question that he\u2014and everyone else, in politics or not, who has ever had a plan\u2014knows the feeling. As much as we hope to ride events, events have a way of riding us.\nToday, unforeseen events are once again in the saddle, and the Democrats\u2019 plan for the orderly defenestration of President Donald Trump has been disordered. They\u2019d hoped for a campaign based on defending Obamacare (now a positive for them), prosecuting the Russia connection (such as it might prove to be), and scourging Trump himself (his aggregated approval rating, while up in recent weeks, is still well below 50 percent).\nThen came\u2026events. Events, that is, that threatened the Democrats\u2019 ascendance.\nThe first event was the rise of democratic socialism, including its lefty offshoots, Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. These positions have been boosted by the hipster glamor of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, yet upon inspection, they\u2019ve proven unpopular with those drab folks in the middle. Indeed, mindful of the danger that such radical ideas pose to the Democrats\u2019 chances in 2020, establishmentarian Dems, urged on by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have worked assiduously and effectively to torpedo both of them.\nThe second event has proven, at least so far, to be less manageable. That\u2019s the sudden prominence of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, the newbie lawmaker from Somalia by way of Minneapolis. Her words\u2014from \u201cit\u2019s all about the Benjamins, baby\u201d to \u201csome people did something\u201c\u2014are now riding roughshod over Democrats\u2019 2020 plan.\nOnce again, Pelosi has been doing her best to get the party back on track. On Sunday night\u2019s edition of 60 Minutes, the House speaker again minimized the new lefties, dismissing AOC, Omar, et al., with a terse, \u201cThat\u2019s like five people.\u201d Mindful of her Democratic colleagues seeking to win in red and purple districts next year, Pelosi added, \u201cWe have to hold the center\u2026we have to\u2026go down the mainstream.\u201d\nThat\u2019s some valiant spin, but the White House wasn\u2019t having it. The next morning, The New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman, perhaps the Fourth Estate\u2019s leading Trumpologist, reported:\nMr. Trump\u2019s advisers describe Ms. Omar as his ideal foil. Her remarks about the power of the pro-Israel lobby in the United States, combined with her role in a progressive contingent of freshman House Democrats who have sparked intraparty battles, have been treated as a gift by Republicans.\nIn fact, within hours, Trump himself had vindicated Haberman\u2019s reporting. Never one to leave a flame unfanned\u2014and eager to burn Pelosi, too\u2014Trump tweeted:\nBefore Nancy, who has lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done, decides to defend her leader, Rep. Omar, she should look at the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements Omar has made. She is out of control, except for her control of Nancy!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019\nSo now, with Trump in the mosh pit, it\u2019s a free-for-all, as partisan pugilists on both sides have gone diving in. Pelosi blasted Trump for supposedly threatening Omar, suggesting that the embattled lawmaker would soon be receiving protection from the Capitol Police. In point of fact, Trump didn\u2019t do anything more than quote Omar, but now Pelosi has now set up a predicate of blame in case something does happen.\nInterestingly, in the midst of the melee, rogue Republican David Frum\u2014who never lost his pragmatic perspective, even as he went to the far end of Never Trumpism\u2014warned his new allies on the Left to cool it. The headline atop his Atlantic piece reads, \u201cDemocrats Are Falling Into the Ilhan Omar Trap: By rushing to stand with the controversial congresswoman, the 2020 contenders are allowing Trump to transform her into the face of their party.\u201d\nHeeding such warnings, many Democrats would obviously rather not be talking about Omar, 9/11, and all that. As another Times reporter, Astead Herndon, explained, the more cautious 2020 presidential hopefuls are trying to stay in the safe zone: \u201cCandidates who have tried to position themselves as pragmatic options to a party lurching to the left\u2026tried to refocus the incident to highlight the need to unify the country.\u201d\nYet Trump and Trumpy Republicans, hoping for a replay of GOP successes in the 2002 and 2004 elections, are determined to keep the focus on Omar\u2014and to pin every Democrat to her.\nIn the meantime, reporters and other diggers will be going through everything she has ever said or done, even as they pump her for her latest hot-take opinions. Will Omar be able to resist the temptation to tell her side of the story? And to share her perspective on world events? After all, she\u2019s now a hero in some circles, having raised an astonishing amount of money for a freshman. And it\u2019s the rare politician who consistently declines to comment on heartfelt concerns.\nYet for the larger sake of their party, Democrats will need an event of their own making. You know, like the 1992 Sister Souljah Moment.\nBack in May 1992, a rapper named Sister Souljah offered an opinion that understandably upset Middle America: \u201cIf black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?\u201d A few weeks later, Bill Clinton, on his way to the Democratic presidential nomination\u2014and seeking votes in the heartland\u2014criticized Ms. Souljah at a meeting of Jesse Jackson\u2019s Rainbow Coalition. \u201cIf you took the words \u2018white\u2019 and \u2018black\u2019 and reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe have an obligation, all of us, to call attention to prejudice whenever we see it.\u201d\nClinton had a point, of course, and yet the impact of a white man criticizing a black woman at a black event was thunderous. He had indeed demonstrated that he was a different kind of Democrat. Later that year, columnist Clarence Page called Clinton\u2019s words \u201cthe most important moment in the 1992 presidential race.\u201d Clinton won the \u201992 election by a wide margin, thereby snapping the Democrats\u2019 string of three consecutive landslide losses.\nAs a political stroke, the \u201cSister Souljah Moment,\u201d defined as confounding the stereotype of one\u2019s own party\u2014whether out of courage, calculation, or both\u2014is so effective that it even has its own Wikipedia page.\nSo will the Democrats do it again? Will they give Omar the \u201cSister Souljah\u201d treatment? If she keeps talking, they\u2019ll have to\u2014if they want to hold any hope of winning next year.\nIn the short run, it\u2019s unlikely that any presidential Democrat will dare to attack Omar, because none of the White House wannabes wish to incur the wrath of the \u201cwoke\u201d primary electorate. Indeed, even Clinton made his move only after he had secured the Democratic nomination, when left-wing activists mattered less.\nYet the 2020 general election is a long way away. Assuming that Omar is still in the news, there will be plenty of time for the party\u2019s eventual nominee to make it clear that Omar doesn\u2019t speak for him, or her.\nOf course, there\u2019s no guarantee that even then the Democratic nominee will take on Omar. Nor is there a guarantee that the nominee will deliver the message as effectively as Clinton did\u2014or that the media will play along, as it did back in \u201992.\nBut if the Democrats can\u2019t find a way to do this distancing, then put it in the bank: Trump and his helpers will force an event of their own. They\u2019ll make it appear that Omar, along with her ideology, is on the Democrats\u2019 national ticket.\nJames P. Pinkerton is an author and contributing editor at The American Conservative.

(The Oscars/ABC/YouTube Screenshot)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As everyone (and especially every conservative) knows, the Oscars of the last few years have been notable for their #Resistance moments. These have ranged from Meryl Streep&rsquo;s mild rebuke of President Trump to the ugly and very inconvenient truths revealed by #MeToo to Frances McDormand&rsquo;s and Patricia Arquette&rsquo;s demands for &ldquo;inclusion riders&rdquo; and gender equality.</p>\n<p>For the most part, however, this year&rsquo;s Oscars chose to let the awards speak for themselves. A film about the private lesbian world of Queen Anne, another about an out gay male rock singer who died of AIDS, plus an African superhero, a neorealist Mexican dramedy, a movie about a &ldquo;Black Klansman,&rdquo; another about a black classical pianist and his downscale white buddy, and even &ldquo;a film about menstruation&rdquo; all won big prizes last night. While critics made fun of &ldquo;Oscar So White&rdquo; a couple years ago, of all the major acting and directing categories, only one award went to a white person (Olivia Colman) this go-round. Carrying the rest were Regina King, Mahershala Ali, Rami Malek, and Alfonso Cuaron, along with plenty of big wins for African-American behind-the-scenes artists. (And at long last, the great Cicely Tyson won her more-than-deserved honorary Oscar, which she was awarded at a special ceremony last November.)</p>\n<p>Before I get pulled over by the Tone Police, I want to say that this is not in any way a criticism, at least not from me. Just this morning, I spoke with a man whom I deeply respect and with whom I&rsquo;ve worked for almost seven years in indie film distribution. While he&rsquo;s in my age group and is as much a film fanatic as I am, he told me that he never really envisioned being up on the Oscar stage&mdash;until this year. As the late great Carmen McRae might have put it, in the past, nominations for black, Latino, and Middle Eastern artists used to be here or there, but they were never everywhere. On Sunday, that changed.</p>\n<p>While most of the wins for the major categories went to the odds-on faves, the first of the evening&rsquo;s two biggest surprises came when British actress Olivia Colman beat out Glenn Close for Best Actress. Colman&rsquo;s stunning acceptance speech was hands-down the classiest act of the evening, and capped with her giving a personal dedication to 10-time nominee Close that recalled the night in 1998 when Ving Rhames gave his Golden Globe to his acting idol and fellow nominee Jack Lemmon.</p>\n<p>Her Best Actor male counterpart, Rami Malek, was the clear frontrunner for his embodiment of the late Queen singer Freddie Mercury. The fact that the two top feature film nominees came mainly from the world of &ldquo;peak TV&rdquo; (USA&rsquo;s prestige flagship <em>Mr. Robot</em> in Malek&rsquo;s case; Netflix&rsquo;s <em>The Crown</em> in Colman&rsquo;s) was certainly a sign of today&rsquo;s digital-era fluidity in film storytelling and multi-platform content.</p>\n<p>And that was only a hint of Oscar&rsquo;s storylines this year.</p>\n<p>In the grand showbiz tradition, the real stunner came with the big finish&mdash;and while there wasn&rsquo;t an envelope malfunction like there was two years ago, critics and viewers alike were just as shocked at the verdict. While most people were essentially wondering whether it would be <em>Black Panther</em> or <em>Roma</em> to take best picture (with a few contrarians rooting for <em>A Star is Born</em> or<em> Bohemian Rhapsody</em>), the comparatively little-known and little-buzzed-about <em>Green Book </em>nailed the night&rsquo;s top honor in the biggest upset of the evening.</p>\n<p><em>Green Book </em>tells the story of the unlikely real-life friendship between an educated black classical pianist on tour in the American South during the end of Jim Crow (played by Mahershala Ali) and the tough, white working class driver and bodyguard he hires for the trip (Viggo Mortensen). The film&rsquo;s title comes from the Auto Club-like guide that was a staple of African-American homes during the segregation era, which listed what restaurants and hotels were willing to serve traveling people of color.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/25/entertainment/green-book-politics/index.html\">As Lisa Respers France of CNN put it</a>, <em>Green Book</em>&rsquo;s Oscar win &ldquo;is so our country right now.&rdquo; She goes on to say that the film has &ldquo;caused a divide&rdquo; between those who see it as an uplifting celebration of interracial friendship &ldquo;and those who see it as racist.&rdquo; (Needless to say, it also perfectly runs down today&rsquo;s political divide between the sympathies of merely <em>liberal</em> older people and downright <em>leftist</em> younger activists.)</p>\n<p>The main controversy over <em>Green Book </em>isn&rsquo;t that it glorifies racism or white supremacy (even its harshest critics recognize it does anything but). The criticism was that it was a throwback to the self-congratulatory days of harmless, uplifting cozies like <em>Driving Miss Daisy</em> and <em>Forrest Gump, </em>as it &ldquo;centered&rdquo; the white male lead and <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2019/02/25/oscars-congressman-john-lewis-green-book-presentation-left-some-viewers-grumbling/23677527/\">reduced the black man to a supporting character</a> in what was largely his story. (The family of the late pianist, Doctor Don Shirley, called the film a &ldquo;symphony of lies.&rdquo;)</p>\n<p>The Obama era saw an unprecedented number of films that centered almost exclusively on characters of color. These demanded that white viewers be able to put themselves in the characters&rsquo; shoes without an audience surrogate to make things safer for them. Even films like <em>Precious </em>and<em> For Colored Girls, </em>which didn&rsquo;t flinch at indulging in negative stereotypes, had their heroines pull themselves and/or each other out of the hole at the end rather than being rescued by a handy &ldquo;white savior&rdquo; who felt empathy for them.</p>\n<p>Likewise, <em>Black Panther</em> was the proudly Afro-centric story of a tough, elegant black superhero who could save the day all by himself. And <em>BlacKkKlansman</em>&rsquo;s story and topic almost speaks for itself. Of course, its director, Spike Lee, won the &ldquo;Oscar&rdquo; for Woke Moment of the Night with his thinly veiled attack on Trump and his warning to &ldquo;do the right thing&rdquo; in the 2020 election. (While prepping this article, I read a headline that said something like &ldquo;Spike Lee Gets Political at the Oscars,&rdquo; and laughed out loud. Saying there&rsquo;s a political component to Spike Lee&rsquo;s art and persona is like saying there&rsquo;s a basketball component to the Lakers.)</p>\n<p>Lee was reportedly so furious at <em>Green Book</em>&rsquo;s surprise win that he <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/02/spike-lee-green-book-storms-out-oscars-blackkklansman-jordan-peele-1202564402/\">turned his back to the camera</a> during the end of the mill-around. Seth Meyers, even before <em>Green Book</em> actually took the top prize, did a <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/02/22/green-book-seth-meyers-white-savior-movie/\">brutal satire of &ldquo;white savior&rdquo; films</a>. And Richard Brody went full-on Terminator against the whole night&rsquo;s awards ceremony in his almost self-parodically <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/2019-oscars-a-spike-lee-win-notwithstanding-hollywoods-dinosaurs-prevailed\">radical-chic takedown in <em>The New Yorker</em></a><em>.</em> Even civil rights legend Congressman John Lewis, who introduced <em>Green Book, </em>alongside Amandla Stenberg, the star of another civil rights-themed picture, <em>The Hate U Give, </em>was not immune to the Twitter backlash.</p>\n<p>The other big-picture takeaway is that, with all of the many platforms for movies these days, and with the Academy under pressure to take films from outside the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, and Paris seriously, of the Best Picture nominees, only <em>Black Panther, A Star is Born, </em>and <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> (and maybe <em>Vice </em>if you&rsquo;re being generous) could be called &ldquo;blockbuster hits.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Because of the exponential growth in independent film, the Oscars already expanded their Best Picture category from a maximum of five to a maximum of 10 selections a decade ago. As content and platforms have only continued to expand and explode, with major &ldquo;studio films&rdquo; more and more dependent on comics and actioners to pay the bills, the Best Picture nominees have only gotten more avant-garde, with magical realist films from diverse directors (<em>Birdman</em>,<em> Roma</em>,<em> The Shape of Water</em>) and intimate, indie-flavored character studies (<em>Lady Bird</em>,<em> Boyhood, Moonlight</em>,<em> Call Me By Your Name)</em> ruling the roost. Meanwhile, as this year&rsquo;s secondary wins for <em>Black Panther</em> and others illustrate, comic book and action films are being taken more and more seriously.</p>\n<p>In some ways, while I was personally against the idea before it happened, having a &ldquo;host-less Oscars&rdquo; seems an apt metaphor for the entire night. The days of five film studios or three or four networks having a near-monopoly on all the &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;important&rdquo; works are long gone. While the explosion of content and of possibilities is a good thing, the drawback is that there seems to be no more unifying center to our current popular culture.</p>\n<p>Except, perhaps, for the Oscars themselves.</p>\n<p><i>Telly Davidson is the author of a new book, </i><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Culture-War-Made-Today-Whether/dp/1476666199/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=theamericonse-20&linkId=08485f784446899f116de03a9866b0fb\">Culture War<i>: </i>How the 90&rsquo;s Made Us Who We Are Today (Like it Or Not)</a><i>.

                "text": "As everyone (and especially every conservative) knows, the Oscars of the last few years have been notable for their #Resistance moments. These have ranged from Meryl Streep\u2019s mild rebuke of President Trump to the ugly and very inconvenient truths revealed by #MeToo to Frances McDormand\u2019s and Patricia Arquette\u2019s demands for \u201cinclusion riders\u201d and gender equality.\nFor the most part, however, this year\u2019s Oscars chose to let the awards speak for themselves. A film about the private lesbian world of Queen Anne, another about an out gay male rock singer who died of AIDS, plus an African superhero, a neorealist Mexican dramedy, a movie about a \u201cBlack Klansman,\u201d another about a black classical pianist and his downscale white buddy, and even \u201ca film about menstruation\u201d all won big prizes last night. While critics made fun of \u201cOscar So White\u201d a couple years ago, of all the major acting and directing categories, only one award went to a white person (Olivia Colman) this go-round. Carrying the rest were Regina King, Mahershala Ali, Rami Malek, and Alfonso Cuaron, along with plenty of big wins for African-American behind-the-scenes artists. (And at long last, the great Cicely Tyson won her more-than-deserved honorary Oscar, which she was awarded at a special ceremony last November.)\nBefore I get pulled over by the Tone Police, I want to say that this is not in any way a criticism, at least not from me. Just this morning, I spoke with a man whom I deeply respect and with whom I\u2019ve worked for almost seven years in indie film distribution. While he\u2019s in my age group and is as much a film fanatic as I am, he told me that he never really envisioned being up on the Oscar stage\u2014until this year. As the late great Carmen McRae might have put it, in the past, nominations for black, Latino, and Middle Eastern artists used to be here or there, but they were never everywhere. On Sunday, that changed.\nWhile most of the wins for the major categories went to the odds-on faves, the first of the evening\u2019s two biggest surprises came when British actress Olivia Colman beat out Glenn Close for Best Actress. Colman\u2019s stunning acceptance speech was hands-down the classiest act of the evening, and capped with her giving a personal dedication to 10-time nominee Close that recalled the night in 1998 when Ving Rhames gave his Golden Globe to his acting idol and fellow nominee Jack Lemmon.\nHer Best Actor male counterpart, Rami Malek, was the clear frontrunner for his embodiment of the late Queen singer Freddie Mercury. The fact that the two top feature film nominees came mainly from the world of \u201cpeak TV\u201d (USA\u2019s prestige flagship Mr. Robot in Malek\u2019s case; Netflix\u2019s The Crown in Colman\u2019s) was certainly a sign of today\u2019s digital-era fluidity in film storytelling and multi-platform content.\nAnd that was only a hint of Oscar\u2019s storylines this year.\nIn the grand showbiz tradition, the real stunner came with the big finish\u2014and while there wasn\u2019t an envelope malfunction like there was two years ago, critics and viewers alike were just as shocked at the verdict. While most people were essentially wondering whether it would be Black Panther or Roma to take best picture (with a few contrarians rooting for A Star is Born or Bohemian Rhapsody), the comparatively little-known and little-buzzed-about Green Book nailed the night\u2019s top honor in the biggest upset of the evening.\nGreen Book tells the story of the unlikely real-life friendship between an educated black classical pianist on tour in the American South during the end of Jim Crow (played by Mahershala Ali) and the tough, white working class driver and bodyguard he hires for the trip (Viggo Mortensen). The film\u2019s title comes from the Auto Club-like guide that was a staple of African-American homes during the segregation era, which listed what restaurants and hotels were willing to serve traveling people of color.\nAs Lisa Respers France of CNN put it, Green Book\u2019s Oscar win \u201cis so our country right now.\u201d She goes on to say that the film has \u201ccaused a divide\u201d between those who see it as an uplifting celebration of interracial friendship \u201cand those who see it as racist.\u201d (Needless to say, it also perfectly runs down today\u2019s political divide between the sympathies of merely liberal older people and downright leftist younger activists.)\nThe main controversy over Green Book isn\u2019t that it glorifies racism or white supremacy (even its harshest critics recognize it does anything but). The criticism was that it was a throwback to the self-congratulatory days of harmless, uplifting cozies like Driving Miss Daisy and Forrest Gump, as it \u201ccentered\u201d the white male lead and reduced the black man to a supporting character in what was largely his story. (The family of the late pianist, Doctor Don Shirley, called the film a \u201csymphony of lies.\u201d)\nThe Obama era saw an unprecedented number of films that centered almost exclusively on characters of color. These demanded that white viewers be able to put themselves in the characters\u2019 shoes without an audience surrogate to make things safer for them. Even films like Precious and For Colored Girls, which didn\u2019t flinch at indulging in negative stereotypes, had their heroines pull themselves and/or each other out of the hole at the end rather than being rescued by a handy \u201cwhite savior\u201d who felt empathy for them.\nLikewise, Black Panther was the proudly Afro-centric story of a tough, elegant black superhero who could save the day all by himself. And BlacKkKlansman\u2019s story and topic almost speaks for itself. Of course, its director, Spike Lee, won the \u201cOscar\u201d for Woke Moment of the Night with his thinly veiled attack on Trump and his warning to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d in the 2020 election. (While prepping this article, I read a headline that said something like \u201cSpike Lee Gets Political at the Oscars,\u201d and laughed out loud. Saying there\u2019s a political component to Spike Lee\u2019s art and persona is like saying there\u2019s a basketball component to the Lakers.)\nLee was reportedly so furious at Green Book\u2019s surprise win that he turned his back to the camera during the end of the mill-around. Seth Meyers, even before Green Book actually took the top prize, did a brutal satire of \u201cwhite savior\u201d films. And Richard Brody went full-on Terminator against the whole night\u2019s awards ceremony in his almost self-parodically radical-chic takedown in The New Yorker. Even civil rights legend Congressman John Lewis, who introduced Green Book, alongside Amandla Stenberg, the star of another civil rights-themed picture, The Hate U Give, was not immune to the Twitter backlash.\nThe other big-picture takeaway is that, with all of the many platforms for movies these days, and with the Academy under pressure to take films from outside the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, and Paris seriously, of the Best Picture nominees, only Black Panther, A Star is Born, and Bohemian Rhapsody (and maybe Vice if you\u2019re being generous) could be called \u201cblockbuster hits.\u201d\nBecause of the exponential growth in independent film, the Oscars already expanded their Best Picture category from a maximum of five to a maximum of 10 selections a decade ago. As content and platforms have only continued to expand and explode, with major \u201cstudio films\u201d more and more dependent on comics and actioners to pay the bills, the Best Picture nominees have only gotten more avant-garde, with magical realist films from diverse directors (Birdman, Roma, The Shape of Water) and intimate, indie-flavored character studies (Lady Bird, Boyhood, Moonlight, Call Me By Your Name) ruling the roost. Meanwhile, as this year\u2019s secondary wins for Black Panther and others illustrate, comic book and action films are being taken more and more seriously.\nIn some ways, while I was personally against the idea before it happened, having a \u201chost-less Oscars\u201d seems an apt metaphor for the entire night. The days of five film studios or three or four networks having a near-monopoly on all the \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cimportant\u201d works are long gone. While the explosion of content and of possibilities is a good thing, the drawback is that there seems to be no more unifying center to our current popular culture.\nExcept, perhaps, for the Oscars themselves.\nTelly Davidson is the author of a new book, Culture War: How the 90\u2019s Made Us Who We Are Today (Like it Or Not).

Vance thread</a>, I mentioned that reader Sam M., who lives in western Pennsylvania, has written in this space, and privately to me, that the employers in his area who offer good manufacturing jobs cannot fill them. Sam adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes. It&rsquo;s a weird thing around here. I graduated high school in 1991, and I consider my class &ldquo;the last of the optimists.&rdquo; The schools and the community and our parents were definitely telling us, get out of here, go to college, there will be nothing for you.&rdquo; But some really smart kids still did it. They tended to stop a few years after that.</p><p>Well, the kids listened, and a lot of the highest performing students left and never came back. A lot of that was because they entered fields that offer few jobs in our area. Any kid with a head on his shoulders who DID take a job in a plant or enter a trade was told repeatedly that he was doing the wrong thing, or wasting his talents.</p><p>Well, now we are in trouble. Try to find an electrician around here. The ones who DID go to the trades can write their own ticket. They generally make more money than I do, with my Ivy League degree, whether they work on their own or bounce from plant to plant demanding higher rates.</p><p>Problem is, the plants all see the crisis looming. In the next 10-20 years, about half their skilled workforce is going to retire, and there is nobody behind those people. They all left. Right now, they figure that even if every single local high school graduate went to work in local factories, we would not be able to keep up with demand. Despite constant automation and improved efficiencies.</p><p>Most of the plants here are on mandatory overtime. They do not have enough workers to fill the jobs. Despite recent efforts to ramp up starting pay dramatically.</p><p>And yet&hellip; if you go downtown on a Wednesday afternoon, you will see quite a few 20-40 guys in pajama pants pushing umbrella strollers. These are not third shift guys helping out their wives. These are dudes who are not working. And not married.</p><p>You can attribute that to a lot of things. Not all of them are as charitable as they should be. But I can tell you that the working class guys I know have more animosity toward the pajama pant guys than they EVER had toward anybody based on race, sexual orientation or any of the other prejudices.</p><p>I think that IS different than when I was a kid. We always had town drunks. But the town drunks could always seem to find work. And even the lowest paying work (sawmills, generally) would be enough to support a family of four with a stay at home mom. And a large degree of dignity.</p><p>Now it isn&rsquo;t. And as best I can tell, it&rsquo;s harder to hold down a job as a meth addict than it is to hold down a job as a drunk, even a whiskey drunk.</p><p>PS: The guys who get in trouble with the law almost always start with DUIs. When I was a kid, you could basically drive drunk all you wanted. Not saying that was a good thing at all. But 40 years ago, the town drunk wasn&rsquo;t getting tossed into jail three times a year for drunk driving. Now he is.</p><p>The dignity afforded to that guy on the bottom rung is less than it was. Partly due to systematic forces. And partly due to a culture that values work and dignity far less than it used to.</p><p>It&rsquo;s both/and.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is about culture. I was just telling a reader today, in correspondence, about how a family doctor friend of mine is seeing the rise of &ldquo;failsons&rdquo; in his middle and upper middle class patients. These are young men with all the educational advantages of their class, but they just have no desire to work, or to do anything but sit around. You can&rsquo;t blame it on poverty or deprivation. So what is it?</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>A reader writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Re: Good Jobs&hellip;But No Workers. I grew up in Western PA in the 80s and 90s and can certainly attest that most of us with talent departed the area. I can further attest that opportunities abound for young men who remain that have a modicum of initiative and work ethic, yet sadly many of those opportunities go unclaimed. During one of my most recent trips to my hometown, I snapped this remarkable photo from the placemat of our favorite local pizza joint. Companies are basically pleading with young men to learn and perform skilled labor for great money (and no student loan debt burdens) yet have precious few takers. Just unbelievably sad seeing this torpor of malaise strangling the young men in our culture.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://2qkhyt1u78lw1ll02a1kxrzq-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/unnamed-e1551209821248.jpg\"></img></figure>\n<p><strong>UPDATE.2: </strong>Sam M. responds:</p>\n<blockquote><p> Well, I will stand by my assessment that it&rsquo;s both/and.</p><p>I know I talked about this before, but in the summer of 1993, home from college, I worked at a brake factory. Guys my age, straight out of high school with no developed skills, were making $14.40 an hour. If you were greedy and worked second or third shift for the differential, you got $15.84. You went UP from there.</p><p>FWIW, accounting for inflation, those guys were making the 2019 equivalent of about $28 an hour. I busted my hump that summer, and cleared enough that I could have bought a brand new Ford Ford F-150, with money to spare. I knew guys who were making 75-80k. It was brutal work. You can&rsquo;t even imagine. But those guys were making a ton of money.</p><p>Even the best jobs don&rsquo;t pay that anymore. Especially unskilled. Which I am sure someone will say, well, that&rsquo;s how it goes. But it&rsquo;s impossible for people who didn&rsquo;t live it to really understand the dignity that was afforded those guys. They had more than money. They had cultural capital. They could afford a decent truck, to keep their wife happy if she chose to stay at home, to pay for Catholic school if they wanted that for their kids. They could afford to send their kids to Penn State or Pitt. A guy who simply worked hard.</p><p>That is still possible, but it&rsquo;s way, way harder. And the kids going off to college seem to have more of an advantage. And the kids who stay suffer more of a stigma.</p><p>The culture and the economics can&rsquo;t really be separated. You can&rsquo;t just say, well, it&rsquo;s one or the other.</p><p>Thing is, we made choices to make it that way. Look, lots of people are better off. We made brakes. Now we don&rsquo;t. The plant is closed. I have no doubt that your brakes cost less in real dollars than they used to. So does your spark plug and your table and your Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle underwear and your Spongebob silverware. And it&rsquo;s cheapter to get to the beach and the Internet is nice. And all that cheapness makes a real material difference in your life and in mine. It&rsquo;s impossible to deniy that. Yes. My brakes are cheaper than they would be if they were still made here in Ridgway. Just like my underwear is cheaper now that it&rsquo;s made in Bangladesh instead of North Carolina. And the Bandladeshi guy making the underwear is (I hope) better off. But there are a few people worse off. We transferred money and dignity from one guy to the other. And the people doing the transferring had someone else take it on the chin for them. Me. My social class. I did the transferring.</p><p>So I try to be careful about just saying hey, it&rsquo;s culture, straighten up.</p><p>If I had gotten a girl pregnant or flunked out of college or made some other dramatic life error, I could have simply recovered by going to work at the brake factory. I would have been fine.</p><p>Until I wouldn&rsquo;t have been. And some people got caught in that exact situation. And all our complaining about lazy pajama pants guy doesn&rsquo;t change that.</p><p>Still, that guy in the pajama pants. It is STILL true that if he sobered up, straightened up and showed up at a factory for more than two weeks in a row, he&rsquo;d be making a family sustaining wage in a few months, tops. And all the griping about country club republicans and limousine liberals does not change that fact.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>about the author</h2>\n<p>Rod Dreher is a senior editor at <i>The American Conservative</i>.

                "text": "In yesterday\u2019s J.D. Vance thread, I mentioned that reader Sam M., who lives in western Pennsylvania, has written in this space, and privately to me, that the employers in his area who offer good manufacturing jobs cannot fill them. Sam adds:\nYes. It\u2019s a weird thing around here. I graduated high school in 1991, and I consider my class \u201cthe last of the optimists.\u201d The schools and the community and our parents were definitely telling us, get out of here, go to college, there will be nothing for you.\u201d But some really smart kids still did it. They tended to stop a few years after that.\nWell, the kids listened, and a lot of the highest performing students left and never came back. A lot of that was because they entered fields that offer few jobs in our area. Any kid with a head on his shoulders who DID take a job in a plant or enter a trade was told repeatedly that he was doing the wrong thing, or wasting his talents.\nWell, now we are in trouble. Try to find an electrician around here. The ones who DID go to the trades can write their own ticket. They generally make more money than I do, with my Ivy League degree, whether they work on their own or bounce from plant to plant demanding higher rates.\nProblem is, the plants all see the crisis looming. In the next 10-20 years, about half their skilled workforce is going to retire, and there is nobody behind those people. They all left. Right now, they figure that even if every single local high school graduate went to work in local factories, we would not be able to keep up with demand. Despite constant automation and improved efficiencies.\nMost of the plants here are on mandatory overtime. They do not have enough workers to fill the jobs. Despite recent efforts to ramp up starting pay dramatically.\nAnd yet\u2026 if you go downtown on a Wednesday afternoon, you will see quite a few 20-40 guys in pajama pants pushing umbrella strollers. These are not third shift guys helping out their wives. These are dudes who are not working. And not married.\nYou can attribute that to a lot of things. Not all of them are as charitable as they should be. But I can tell you that the working class guys I know have more animosity toward the pajama pant guys than they EVER had toward anybody based on race, sexual orientation or any of the other prejudices.\nI think that IS different than when I was a kid. We always had town drunks. But the town drunks could always seem to find work. And even the lowest paying work (sawmills, generally) would be enough to support a family of four with a stay at home mom. And a large degree of dignity.\nNow it isn\u2019t. And as best I can tell, it\u2019s harder to hold down a job as a meth addict than it is to hold down a job as a drunk, even a whiskey drunk.\nPS: The guys who get in trouble with the law almost always start with DUIs. When I was a kid, you could basically drive drunk all you wanted. Not saying that was a good thing at all. But 40 years ago, the town drunk wasn\u2019t getting tossed into jail three times a year for drunk driving. Now he is.\nThe dignity afforded to that guy on the bottom rung is less than it was. Partly due to systematic forces. And partly due to a culture that values work and dignity far less than it used to.\nIt\u2019s both/and.\nThis is about culture. I was just telling a reader today, in correspondence, about how a family doctor friend of mine is seeing the rise of \u201cfailsons\u201d in his middle and upper middle class patients. These are young men with all the educational advantages of their class, but they just have no desire to work, or to do anything but sit around. You can\u2019t blame it on poverty or deprivation. So what is it?\nUPDATE: A reader writes:\nRe: Good Jobs\u2026But No Workers. I grew up in Western PA in the 80s and 90s and can certainly attest that most of us with talent departed the area. I can further attest that opportunities abound for young men who remain that have a modicum of initiative and work ethic, yet sadly many of those opportunities go unclaimed. During one of my most recent trips to my hometown, I snapped this remarkable photo from the placemat of our favorite local pizza joint. Companies are basically pleading with young men to learn and perform skilled labor for great money (and no student loan debt burdens) yet have precious few takers. Just unbelievably sad seeing this torpor of malaise strangling the young men in our culture.\nUPDATE.2: Sam M. responds:\nWell, I will stand by my assessment that it\u2019s both/and.\nI know I talked about this before, but in the summer of 1993, home from college, I worked at a brake factory. Guys my age, straight out of high school with no developed skills, were making $14.40 an hour. If you were greedy and worked second or third shift for the differential, you got $15.84. You went UP from there.\nFWIW, accounting for inflation, those guys were making the 2019 equivalent of about $28 an hour. I busted my hump that summer, and cleared enough that I could have bought a brand new Ford Ford F-150, with money to spare. I knew guys who were making 75-80k. It was brutal work. You can\u2019t even imagine. But those guys were making a ton of money.\nEven the best jobs don\u2019t pay that anymore. Especially unskilled. Which I am sure someone will say, well, that\u2019s how it goes. But it\u2019s impossible for people who didn\u2019t live it to really understand the dignity that was afforded those guys. They had more than money. They had cultural capital. They could afford a decent truck, to keep their wife happy if she chose to stay at home, to pay for Catholic school if they wanted that for their kids. They could afford to send their kids to Penn State or Pitt. A guy who simply worked hard.\nThat is still possible, but it\u2019s way, way harder. And the kids going off to college seem to have more of an advantage. And the kids who stay suffer more of a stigma.\nThe culture and the economics can\u2019t really be separated. You can\u2019t just say, well, it\u2019s one or the other.\nThing is, we made choices to make it that way. Look, lots of people are better off. We made brakes. Now we don\u2019t. The plant is closed. I have no doubt that your brakes cost less in real dollars than they used to. So does your spark plug and your table and your Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle underwear and your Spongebob silverware. And it\u2019s cheapter to get to the beach and the Internet is nice. And all that cheapness makes a real material difference in your life and in mine. It\u2019s impossible to deniy that. Yes. My brakes are cheaper than they would be if they were still made here in Ridgway. Just like my underwear is cheaper now that it\u2019s made in Bangladesh instead of North Carolina. And the Bandladeshi guy making the underwear is (I hope) better off. But there are a few people worse off. We transferred money and dignity from one guy to the other. And the people doing the transferring had someone else take it on the chin for them. Me. My social class. I did the transferring.\nSo I try to be careful about just saying hey, it\u2019s culture, straighten up.\nIf I had gotten a girl pregnant or flunked out of college or made some other dramatic life error, I could have simply recovered by going to work at the brake factory. I would have been fine.\nUntil I wouldn\u2019t have been. And some people got caught in that exact situation. And all our complaining about lazy pajama pants guy doesn\u2019t change that.\nStill, that guy in the pajama pants. It is STILL true that if he sobered up, straightened up and showed up at a factory for more than two weeks in a row, he\u2019d be making a family sustaining wage in a few months, tops. And all the griping about country club republicans and limousine liberals does not change that fact.\nabout the author\nRod Dreher is a senior editor at The American Conservative.

The administration very much wants to have things both ways. On the one hand, they will say that the U.S. isn&rsquo;t a party to the conflict and therefore the resolution isn&rsquo;t needed, but then they&rsquo;ll insist that U.S. involvement in the conflict must continue for the sake of the Saudi relationship, weapons sales, and so on. Supporters of the war are desperate to claim at the same time that U.S. involvement is so meager that it doesn&rsquo;t amount to hostilities but also so vitally important that it must not be ended. Of course, if the U.S. role were really as small as they sometimes claim, there would be no danger in ending it, and if it is as significant as they say at other times it is absolutely appropriate for Congress to shut it down because Congress never authorized it.</p>\n<p>Much of the rest of the statement is the same tedious propaganda they have been reciting for years:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The joint resolution would also harm the foreign policy of the United States. Its efforts to curtail certain forms of military support would harm our bilateral relationships, negatively affect our ongoing efforts to prevent civilian casualties and prevent the spread of terrorist organizations such as al-Qa&rsquo;ida in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS, and embolden Iran&rsquo;s malign activities in Yemen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The &ldquo;ongoing efforts to prevent civilian casualties&rdquo; have been famously unsuccessful because Saudi coalition pilots so frequently attack civilian targets on purpose. If the U.S. is giving them the right advice on how to avoid causing civilian casualties, the coalition forces are either incapable or unwilling to follow it. That means that the U.S. is enabling more civilian casualties by continuing to provide support for the bombing campaign. The Saudi coalition war has strengthened AQAP and the local ISIS affiliate in two ways: it has distracted from and interfered with combating these groups and that has allowed them to become more powerful, and the coalition has taken to <a href=\"https://theamericanconservative.com/larison/the-u-s-is-on-the-side-of-terrorists-and-war-criminals-in-yemen/\">arming</a>, <a href=\"https://theamericanconservative.com/larison/how-the-war-on-yemen-helps-al-qaeda/\">recruiting</a>, and funding AQAP members and their allies when it suits them. The Saudis and UAE have been <a href=\"https://theamericanconservative.com/larison/report-saudi-coalition-diverting-weapons-to-yemeni-militias/\">providing</a> known terrorists with access to weapons sold to them by the U.S. and other arms suppliers in violation of the agreements they signed. Continuing to back the war means backing the allies of AQAP. The Saudi coalition governments are not reliable or trustworthy partners, and if curtailing assistance to them damages relations with them in the near term that is not such a great price to pay for ending our complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>\n<p>Trump absurdly claims that aiding and abetting Saudi coalition war crimes has something to do with protecting Americans in Gulf countries, but there would be no threat to those countries if the bombing campaign were halted. The continued bombing of Yemen&rsquo;s cities and villages is what puts coalition countries at risk of retaliation. Trump&rsquo;s determination to keep assisting this bombing campaign is what&rsquo;s truly dangerous.</p>\n<p>At one point, Trump unwittingly provides an argument against his own position:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In addition, the conflict in Yemen represents a &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; and inexpensive way for Iran to cause trouble for the United States and for our ally, Saudi Arabia.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To the extent that Iran is involved at all, it is the continuation of the war that gives Iran this opportunity to cause trouble. The longer that the U.S. supports the Saudi coalition and keeps the war going, the better things are for Iran. Iran&rsquo;s involvement in Yemen has always been very limited, but it has increased because of the war and the best way to make sure that it doesn&rsquo;t continue to increase is to pressure the Saudis and Emiratis to bring the war to an end. Otherwise, the Saudis and the UAE will remain bogged down in a quagmire of their own choosing, and the U.S. will continue to be implicated in their many crimes because of the support Trump refuses to end.</p>\n<p>The war on Yemen is indefensible, so it is no surprise that the arguments offered in support of it are always so weak and riddled with falsehoods.

                "text": "The full White House statement on Trump\u2019s shameful Yemen veto is full of the usual obfuscations and lies that the administration has used to defend involvement in the war for the last two years:\nThis joint resolution is unnecessary because, apart from counterterrorism operations against al-Qa\u2019ida in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS, the United States is not engaged in hostilities in or affecting Yemen.\nAs long as the U.S. is providing logistical and intelligence support to the Saudi coalition, deploying troops to the Saudi border with Yemen, and assisting in the enforcement of the naval blockade, it is a party to the conflict and engaged in hostilities.When the president and other officials claim otherwise, they are not telling the truth. The administration very much wants to have things both ways. On the one hand, they will say that the U.S. isn\u2019t a party to the conflict and therefore the resolution isn\u2019t needed, but then they\u2019ll insist that U.S. involvement in the conflict must continue for the sake of the Saudi relationship, weapons sales, and so on. Supporters of the war are desperate to claim at the same time that U.S. involvement is so meager that it doesn\u2019t amount to hostilities but also so vitally important that it must not be ended. Of course, if the U.S. role were really as small as they sometimes claim, there would be no danger in ending it, and if it is as significant as they say at other times it is absolutely appropriate for Congress to shut it down because Congress never authorized it.\nMuch of the rest of the statement is the same tedious propaganda they have been reciting for years:\nThe joint resolution would also harm the foreign policy of the United States. Its efforts to curtail certain forms of military support would harm our bilateral relationships, negatively affect our ongoing efforts to prevent civilian casualties and prevent the spread of terrorist organizations such as al-Qa\u2019ida in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS, and embolden Iran\u2019s malign activities in Yemen.\nThe \u201congoing efforts to prevent civilian casualties\u201d have been famously unsuccessful because Saudi coalition pilots so frequently attack civilian targets on purpose. If the U.S. is giving them the right advice on how to avoid causing civilian casualties, the coalition forces are either incapable or unwilling to follow it. That means that the U.S. is enabling more civilian casualties by continuing to provide support for the bombing campaign. The Saudi coalition war has strengthened AQAP and the local ISIS affiliate in two ways: it has distracted from and interfered with combating these groups and that has allowed them to become more powerful, and the coalition has taken to arming, recruiting, and funding AQAP members and their allies when it suits them. The Saudis and UAE have been providing known terrorists with access to weapons sold to them by the U.S. and other arms suppliers in violation of the agreements they signed. Continuing to back the war means backing the allies of AQAP. The Saudi coalition governments are not reliable or trustworthy partners, and if curtailing assistance to them damages relations with them in the near term that is not such a great price to pay for ending our complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nTrump absurdly claims that aiding and abetting Saudi coalition war crimes has something to do with protecting Americans in Gulf countries, but there would be no threat to those countries if the bombing campaign were halted. The continued bombing of Yemen\u2019s cities and villages is what puts coalition countries at risk of retaliation. Trump\u2019s determination to keep assisting this bombing campaign is what\u2019s truly dangerous.\nAt one point, Trump unwittingly provides an argument against his own position:\nIn addition, the conflict in Yemen represents a \u201ccheap\u201d and inexpensive way for Iran to cause trouble for the United States and for our ally, Saudi Arabia.\nTo the extent that Iran is involved at all, it is the continuation of the war that gives Iran this opportunity to cause trouble. The longer that the U.S. supports the Saudi coalition and keeps the war going, the better things are for Iran. Iran\u2019s involvement in Yemen has always been very limited, but it has increased because of the war and the best way to make sure that it doesn\u2019t continue to increase is to pressure the Saudis and Emiratis to bring the war to an end. Otherwise, the Saudis and the UAE will remain bogged down in a quagmire of their own choosing, and the U.S. will continue to be implicated in their many crimes because of the support Trump refuses to end.\nThe war on Yemen is indefensible, so it is no surprise that the arguments offered in support of it are always so weak and riddled with falsehoods. Trump\u2019s statement in defense of his indefensible veto is exceptionally weak and dishonest, and members of Congress should treat his message with the contempt it deserves.\nabout the author\nDaniel Larison is a senior editor at TAC, where he also keeps a solo blog.

He inherited this indefensible policy from Obama, but unlike many other Obama policies that he couldn&rsquo;t wait to undo he continued and expanded on this one. His embrace of the Saudis and their war has been a major part of his foreign policy, and with this veto he has defined his presidency with his abject subservience to Riyadh and his complete indifference to the world&rsquo;s worst humanitarian crisis. Trump has spent the last two years covering up for the Saudi coalition and their war crimes, and today he has used his veto to shield them from the consequences of their action one more time.</p>\n<p>Withdrawing U.S. support from the Saudi coalition endangers no Americans, and it is another one of his scurrilous lies for Trump to say so. Reining in a lawless executive has been long overdue, but it is no surprise that the lawless occupant of the White House refuses to accept limitations on what he can do. It falls back to Congress again to use every means at their disposal to shut off all military assistance to the Saudi coalition governments and to cut off all funding to U.S. operations that provide them with support. Trump&rsquo;s continued enabling of the atrocious war on Yemen should be made into a major issue in the presidential election, and he should be forced to defend his disgusting actions to the voting public. Congress must continue to do all they can to force an end to our government&rsquo;s illegal, unauthorized involvement in this war.</p>\n<p>Following the House passage of S.J.Res. 7, Oxfam&rsquo;s Scott Paul <a href=\"https://www.oxfamamerica.org/press/in-advance-of-the-house-passage-of-the-war-powers-resolution-oxfam-americas-humanitarian-policy-lead-scott-paul-said/\">said</a> this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A veto from President Trump would send its own sobering message to Yemeni families caught in the daily hell of war: our administration simply does not care. The people of Yemen and the parties to the conflict are watching closely and the messages US leaders send have the power to save lives. With a veto, they lose faith in the United States and see the end to their suffering a little further out of reach. Congress must act to keep up the pressure, and not let President Trump&rsquo;s cynical, transactional and heartless brand of politics define America&rsquo;s role in the world. Now Congress must act to end arms sales to all parties fighting in this brutal conflict.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Today Trump has proven once more to the people of Yemen just how cynical he and the other supporters of the war are. Support for the war on Yemen is the most disgraceful U.S. policy today, and it is one of the most despicable policies of the last fifty years. That is what Trump chooses to continue and defend. He has chosen again and again to cater to and indulge some of the worst governments on earth, and he has done so for the basest reasons of protecting future weapons sales. If we knew nothing else about him, this would tell us all we need to know about his contempt for the law, his cruelty, and his disregard for innocent life.</p>\n<h2>about the author</h2>\n<p>Daniel Larison is a senior editor at <i>TAC</i>, where he also keeps a solo <a href=\"https://theamericanconservative.com/larison\">blog</a>.

He concludes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But in this case, the social, economic, and security costs of intervening far outweigh the benefits. Whether the United States launched limited air strikes or a full ground invasion, it would almost certainly get sucked in to a long, difficult campaign to stabilize Venezuela after the initial fighting was over. Such an engagement would cost American lives and money and hurt the United States&rsquo; standing in Latin America. An extended occupation would reignite anti-Americanism in the region, particularly if U.S. soldiers committed real or perceived abuses, and it would damage U.S. relations with countries outside the region, too. Finally, a war-weary American public is unlikely to stand for yet another extended military campaign.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to being a prolonged, costly undertaking, intervention in Venezuela would be illegal as well as unwise. Congress won&rsquo;t authorize an air war or an invasion, and the president has no authority to initiate a war against another country on his own. A U.S. war against the Venezuelan government would rightly be considered a violation of the U.N. Charter by most U.N. members, and there would obviously be no Security Council resolution authorizing such action. Venezuela&rsquo;s neighbors do not support military intervention and would not participate in it, and they would be the ones to suffer from the destabilizing effects of any war. The U.S. would be stuck with the burden of stabilizing the country and it would take most or all of the blame for continued violence and disorder, and it is doubtful that the U.S. could commit enough forces to do a proper job of providing security in a country as large as Venezuela. Above all, the war would be completely unnecessary and not make the United States the slightest bit more secure. There is no excuse for incurring the expense and losses of yet another war of choice for regime change.</p>\n<p>Given all of the likely costs and dangers of a Venezuelan war, how can military action still be considered a legitimate and acceptable policy option? Every other government in the region has correctly ruled out military intervention as the wrong thing to do, and there is no good reason why the U.S. shouldn&rsquo;t do the same. Congress and the public need to make clear that they don&rsquo;t support and won&rsquo;t tolerate war with Venezuela.</p>\n<h2>about the author</h2>\n<p>Daniel Larison is a senior editor at <i>TAC</i>, where he also keeps a solo <a href=\"https://theamericanconservative.com/larison\">blog</a>.

                "text": "Frank Mora does a fine job considering the risks and potential pitfalls of different kinds of U.S. military intervention in Venezuela. He concludes:\nBut in this case, the social, economic, and security costs of intervening far outweigh the benefits. Whether the United States launched limited air strikes or a full ground invasion, it would almost certainly get sucked in to a long, difficult campaign to stabilize Venezuela after the initial fighting was over. Such an engagement would cost American lives and money and hurt the United States\u2019 standing in Latin America. An extended occupation would reignite anti-Americanism in the region, particularly if U.S. soldiers committed real or perceived abuses, and it would damage U.S. relations with countries outside the region, too. Finally, a war-weary American public is unlikely to stand for yet another extended military campaign.\nIn addition to being a prolonged, costly undertaking, intervention in Venezuela would be illegal as well as unwise. Congress won\u2019t authorize an air war or an invasion, and the president has no authority to initiate a war against another country on his own. A U.S. war against the Venezuelan government would rightly be considered a violation of the U.N. Charter by most U.N. members, and there would obviously be no Security Council resolution authorizing such action. Venezuela\u2019s neighbors do not support military intervention and would not participate in it, and they would be the ones to suffer from the destabilizing effects of any war. The U.S. would be stuck with the burden of stabilizing the country and it would take most or all of the blame for continued violence and disorder, and it is doubtful that the U.S. could commit enough forces to do a proper job of providing security in a country as large as Venezuela. Above all, the war would be completely unnecessary and not make the United States the slightest bit more secure. There is no excuse for incurring the expense and losses of yet another war of choice for regime change.\nGiven all of the likely costs and dangers of a Venezuelan war, how can military action still be considered a legitimate and acceptable policy option? Every other government in the region has correctly ruled out military intervention as the wrong thing to do, and there is no good reason why the U.S. shouldn\u2019t do the same. Congress and the public need to make clear that they don\u2019t support and won\u2019t tolerate war with Venezuela.\nabout the author\nDaniel Larison is a senior editor at TAC, where he also keeps a solo blog.

Juli&aacute;n Castro has signaled support for it as well. Elizabeth Warren has pushed, for years, for &ldquo;debt-free&rdquo; college. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand have signed on to legislation that could make college debt-free. Even Amy Klobuchar, <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-amy-klobuchar-is-a-no-on-free-college-tuition\">who notably</a> shirked &ldquo;free college for all&rdquo; during a CNN town hall in February, <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/press-releases/americas-college-promise\">signed on to</a> a metered free-college proposal last year.</p>\n<p>All together, the field seems to have converged on a consensus: A free-college proposal&mdash;or an answer about why they don&rsquo;t have one&mdash;is something of a prerequisite for Democratic candidates hoping to challenge Donald Trump in the 2020 election.</p>\n<p>The <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/09/where-did-americas-dream-of-free-college-go/569770/\">consensus is long</a> in the making: In 2008, the last time there was a large field of Democratic hopefuls, the proposals were more piecemeal. Many candidates <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/06/obamas_remarks_on_college_affo.html\">pushed tax credits to offset college costs and suggested expanding grants</a> for low-income students. Hillary Clinton suggested a national service program that would allow students to earn up to $10,000, which could be used toward education.</p>\n<p>Over time, the ideas grew in ambition. By 2015, in his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'\" href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/education/higher-education\">was saying</a> that he wanted two years of community college to be &ldquo;as free and universal in America as high school is today.&rdquo; And in the last presidential election, in 2016, Hillary Clinton, who had originally said she believed &ldquo;in affordable college, but [not] in free college,&rdquo; was pushed by her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, to embrace tuition-free college. Her ultimate acceptance of a free-college model ensured that it would be a feature of future Democratic platforms.</p>\n<p>For Democratic candidates now, the question is not so much whether to support a plan to make college more affordable, but what the right approach is for doing so. The details&mdash;whether there is an income cap for eligibility; whether the government covers tuition costs up front before grants; whether there are merit or GPA requirements&mdash;will determine who will benefit the most, and who will pay for such a plan.</p>\n<p>A subtle tweak from Kamala Harris this past January encapsulates the coming debate over the scope of the party&rsquo;s proposals. The senator from California, while making formal what many had suspected&mdash;that she would be running for president&mdash;tweaked her language in a slight but potentially significant way. She was supporting free college, but not just any free college: She was pushing for debt-free college. &ldquo;I am running to declare education is a fundamental right,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and we will guarantee that right with universal pre-K and debt-free college.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What was the difference? <em>Free college </em>is a catchall term for a range of college-affordability plans. There are &ldquo;tuition-free&rdquo; programs, where the government&mdash;or an institution&mdash;covers tuition but not the other expenses, such as books, housing, or food; then there are debt-free college plans, which aim to address all those other costs. Harris was getting specific; and she was doing so with the kind of free-college idea&mdash;debt-free&mdash;that equity advocates tend to prefer.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, tuition-free models are &ldquo;last dollar,&rdquo; which means that the government covers tuition after all other grant aid&mdash;such as Pell Grants, which are federal grants for low-income students&mdash;is applied. Oftentimes those grants cover the full tuition at community colleges, and students aren&rsquo;t able to use that money for things like books, housing, or food. These are things that they may ultimately have to take on debt to afford. &ldquo;Progressive candidates need to be talking about debt-free college instead of just free college, and going beyond tuition for low-income students,&rdquo; Tiffany Jones, the director of higher-education policy at the Education Trust, an advocacy group for low-income students, told me.</p>\n<p>Harris&rsquo;s declaration was a departure from her language in 2016, when she first introduced a plan, <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article102937257.html\">toward the end</a> of her Senate campaign, to make community college tuition-free for all, and four-year college tuition-free for families making less than $140,000 a year; it was even a departure from <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'\" href=\"https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1084520202908418049\">weeks prior</a>, when she pushed for tuition-free college. Her development signaled, perhaps above all, how the Democratic Party has evolved on college affordability.</p>\n<p>The United States has a long history of college-access and -affordability policies&mdash;the first Morrill Act, the GI Bill, etc.&mdash;that did not provide equitable access or universal affordability, particularly for minorities. Advocates hope that a similar mistake won&rsquo;t be made with a potential national free-college policy, and that debt-free college becomes the new gold standard.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the beauty of debt-free college programs: There is a lot of flexibility in there on policy design,&rdquo; Mark Huelsman, a policy director at Demos, a liberal think tank, told me. A candidate could, for example, propose massively expanding access to the Pell Grant program so that more working- and middle-class students were eligible, and then subsidize education at HBCUs or private institutions that serve large shares of low-income students. A policy could, as Senator Brian Schatz&rsquo;s Debt-Free College Act does, incentivize states to invest more in free-college programs by providing a one-to-one federal match on state spending.</p>\n<p>In recent years, in the absence of ambitious federal efforts to deal with college costs, states, both red and blue, have been introducing their own college-affordability plans. &ldquo;Anybody who wanted to do anything big or bold on college affordability had to do it at the state level,&rdquo; Huelsman told me. More than 20 states have adopted free-college models since 2005. New Jersey, West Virginia, and Virginia look to be the next three states to implement free-college plans, Martha Kanter, the executive director of the College Promise Campaign, told me&mdash;none of which are debt-free plans.</p>\n<p>Debt-free college plans are, by nature, expensive, and states have to run a balanced budget. The federal government doesn&rsquo;t, which means that it can take on debt to pay for a free-college plan. Some hopefuls, such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have proposed taxes to help offset the cost of their plans. Others have been much less specific about how they plan to pay for their proposals. Still, candidates will be hard-pressed to convince Americans that the answer to the college-affordability crisis is for taxpayers to just eat the debt.</p>\n<p>That said, a free-college plan is only part of the solution. As Natalia Abrams, the executive director of Student Debt Crisis, an advocacy organization, put it, &ldquo;While free college is needed and will help curb future college costs and future student debt, it will do nothing to help the 45 million people that are suffering with it right now.&rdquo; After all, <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-25/millennials-face-1-trillion-debt-as-student-loans-pile-up\">Millennials alone</a> hold more than a trillion dollars in student debt.</p>\n<p>Candidates have offered some solutions. Bernie Sanders&rsquo;s 2017 <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/collegeforallsummary/?inline=file\">College for All Act</a>, for example, would have lowered interest rates for student loans and allowed current borrowers to refinance their loans at that lower rate. Warren, Harris, and Gillibrand were among the bill&rsquo;s co-sponsors.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Abrams told me, there is an acute need for consumer protections: Free-college plans should strengthen the repayment programs that are currently available, such as income-based repayment, which allows borrowers to pay a lower, more affordable amount for their loans; and there should be active enforcement of policies like borrower defense to repayment, which allows students to have their loans discharged if they&rsquo;ve been defrauded and their school was closed.</p>\n<p>Whatever the details of the plan, the motive for action is obvious: College has become a prerequisite for most high-paying jobs, and yet college itself is unaffordable for millions. &ldquo;What happens when you don&rsquo;t have the full cost of attendance covered?&rdquo; Jones asked rhetorically. &ldquo;Students stopping out. Students working more hours. These are things that the research suggests decrease their likelihood of actually completing,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;We know that has disproportionate impact on low-income students and students of color. Black students in particular.&rdquo; As a result, many feel&mdash;and indeed are&mdash;shut out of America&rsquo;s prosperity.</p>\n<p>We want to hear what you think about this article. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/contact/letters/\">Submit a letter</a> to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.</p>",

                "text": "Bernie Sanders has called for tuition-free college. Juli\u00e1n Castro has signaled support for it as well. Elizabeth Warren has pushed, for years, for \u201cdebt-free\u201d college. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand have signed on to legislation that could make college debt-free. Even Amy Klobuchar, who notably shirked \u201cfree college for all\u201d during a CNN town hall in February, signed on to a metered free-college proposal last year.\nAll together, the field seems to have converged on a consensus: A free-college proposal\u2014or an answer about why they don\u2019t have one\u2014is something of a prerequisite for Democratic candidates hoping to challenge Donald Trump in the 2020 election.\nThe consensus is long in the making: In 2008, the last time there was a large field of Democratic hopefuls, the proposals were more piecemeal. Many candidates pushed tax credits to offset college costs and suggested expanding grants for low-income students. Hillary Clinton suggested a national service program that would allow students to earn up to $10,000, which could be used toward education.\nOver time, the ideas grew in ambition. By 2015, in his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama was saying that he wanted two years of community college to be \u201cas free and universal in America as high school is today.\u201d And in the last presidential election, in 2016, Hillary Clinton, who had originally said she believed \u201cin affordable college, but [not] in free college,\u201d was pushed by her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, to embrace tuition-free college. Her ultimate acceptance of a free-college model ensured that it would be a feature of future Democratic platforms.\nFor Democratic candidates now, the question is not so much whether to support a plan to make college more affordable, but what the right approach is for doing so. The details\u2014whether there is an income cap for eligibility; whether the government covers tuition costs up front before grants; whether there are merit or GPA requirements\u2014will determine who will benefit the most, and who will pay for such a plan.\nA subtle tweak from Kamala Harris this past January encapsulates the coming debate over the scope of the party\u2019s proposals. The senator from California, while making formal what many had suspected\u2014that she would be running for president\u2014tweaked her language in a slight but potentially significant way. She was supporting free college, but not just any free college: She was pushing for debt-free college. \u201cI am running to declare education is a fundamental right,\u201d she said, \u201cand we will guarantee that right with universal pre-K and debt-free college.\u201d\nWhat was the difference? Free college is a catchall term for a range of college-affordability plans. There are \u201ctuition-free\u201d programs, where the government\u2014or an institution\u2014covers tuition but not the other expenses, such as books, housing, or food; then there are debt-free college plans, which aim to address all those other costs. Harris was getting specific; and she was doing so with the kind of free-college idea\u2014debt-free\u2014that equity advocates tend to prefer.\nOftentimes, tuition-free models are \u201clast dollar,\u201d which means that the government covers tuition after all other grant aid\u2014such as Pell Grants, which are federal grants for low-income students\u2014is applied. Oftentimes those grants cover the full tuition at community colleges, and students aren\u2019t able to use that money for things like books, housing, or food. These are things that they may ultimately have to take on debt to afford. \u201cProgressive candidates need to be talking about debt-free college instead of just free college, and going beyond tuition for low-income students,\u201d Tiffany Jones, the director of higher-education policy at the Education Trust, an advocacy group for low-income students, told me.\nHarris\u2019s declaration was a departure from her language in 2016, when she first introduced a plan, toward the end of her Senate campaign, to make community college tuition-free for all, and four-year college tuition-free for families making less than $140,000 a year; it was even a departure from weeks prior, when she pushed for tuition-free college. Her development signaled, perhaps above all, how the Democratic Party has evolved on college affordability.\nThe United States has a long history of college-access and -affordability policies\u2014the first Morrill Act, the GI Bill, etc.\u2014that did not provide equitable access or universal affordability, particularly for minorities. Advocates hope that a similar mistake won\u2019t be made with a potential national free-college policy, and that debt-free college becomes the new gold standard.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of debt-free college programs: There is a lot of flexibility in there on policy design,\u201d Mark Huelsman, a policy director at Demos, a liberal think tank, told me. A candidate could, for example, propose massively expanding access to the Pell Grant program so that more working- and middle-class students were eligible, and then subsidize education at HBCUs or private institutions that serve large shares of low-income students. A policy could, as Senator Brian Schatz\u2019s Debt-Free College Act does, incentivize states to invest more in free-college programs by providing a one-to-one federal match on state spending.\nIn recent years, in the absence of ambitious federal efforts to deal with college costs, states, both red and blue, have been introducing their own college-affordability plans. \u201cAnybody who wanted to do anything big or bold on college affordability had to do it at the state level,\u201d Huelsman told me. More than 20 states have adopted free-college models since 2005. New Jersey, West Virginia, and Virginia look to be the next three states to implement free-college plans, Martha Kanter, the executive director of the College Promise Campaign, told me\u2014none of which are debt-free plans.\nDebt-free college plans are, by nature, expensive, and states have to run a balanced budget. The federal government doesn\u2019t, which means that it can take on debt to pay for a free-college plan. Some hopefuls, such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have proposed taxes to help offset the cost of their plans. Others have been much less specific about how they plan to pay for their proposals. Still, candidates will be hard-pressed to convince Americans that the answer to the college-affordability crisis is for taxpayers to just eat the debt.\nThat said, a free-college plan is only part of the solution. As Natalia Abrams, the executive director of Student Debt Crisis, an advocacy organization, put it, \u201cWhile free college is needed and will help curb future college costs and future student debt, it will do nothing to help the 45 million people that are suffering with it right now.\u201d After all, Millennials alone hold more than a trillion dollars in student debt.\nCandidates have offered some solutions. Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2017 College for All Act, for example, would have lowered interest rates for student loans and allowed current borrowers to refinance their loans at that lower rate. Warren, Harris, and Gillibrand were among the bill\u2019s co-sponsors.\nAdditionally, Abrams told me, there is an acute need for consumer protections: Free-college plans should strengthen the repayment programs that are currently available, such as income-based repayment, which allows borrowers to pay a lower, more affordable amount for their loans; and there should be active enforcement of policies like borrower defense to repayment, which allows students to have their loans discharged if they\u2019ve been defrauded and their school was closed.\nWhatever the details of the plan, the motive for action is obvious: College has become a prerequisite for most high-paying jobs, and yet college itself is unaffordable for millions. \u201cWhat happens when you don\u2019t have the full cost of attendance covered?\u201d Jones asked rhetorically. \u201cStudents stopping out. Students working more hours. These are things that the research suggests decrease their likelihood of actually completing,\u201d she answered. \u201cWe know that has disproportionate impact on low-income students and students of color. Black students in particular.\u201d As a result, many feel\u2014and indeed are\u2014shut out of America\u2019s prosperity.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

For many young boys, there continues to be a very small space that they can occupy to be considered traditionally &ldquo;masculine,&rdquo; and that small space can be restricting, forcing boys to lose what doesn&rsquo;t fit inside it.</p>\n<p>In his new book, <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Raise-Boy-Power-Connection/dp/0143133209\"><em>How to Raise a Boy</em></a>, Michael Reichert calls that space the &ldquo;man box.&rdquo; Reichert is a psychologist who specializes in boys and men, and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Boys&rsquo; and Girls&rsquo; Lives at the University of Pennsylvania. His book is written as a guide to parents who want to create more space for their boys to express themselves. The key, he writes is &ldquo;a relationship in which a boy can tell that he matters &hellip; A young man&rsquo;s self confidence is not accidental or serendipitous but derives from experiences of being accurately understood, loved, and supported.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I spoke with Reichert about how parents, teachers, and other adults can strengthen their relationships with boys, even when those boys act out, and in so doing help them create a broader expression of masculinity for themselves. An edited and condensed transcript of our conversation follows.</p>\n<p><strong>Julie Beck:</strong> You write that &ldquo;boys&rsquo; first disconnection is from themselves.&rdquo; What do you mean by that?</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Reichert:</strong> I use a quote in my book from a George Orwell story called <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'\" href=\"http://orwell.ru/library/articles/elephant/english/e_eleph\">&ldquo;Shooting an Elephant.&rdquo;</a> He is a colonial policeman in Burma being asked to kill an elephant running amok in a village, and he is expected to do it without any show of hesitation or regret. The sentence he used to describe what that policeman experienced was: &ldquo;He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Requiring boys to differentiate what they show the world and what they feel inside happens really young. I have a two-and-a-half-year-old grandson who is already learning what's okay to show and what he has to keep to himself. A boy grows into that mask to the point where the mask becomes how he thinks of himself. He becomes cut off from his heart.</p>\n<p>The first component of emotional intelligence is emotional awareness. But the rules of society mean that boys have to censor what they express, and sometimes the only way to do that is to convince yourself that you&rsquo;re not feeling what you&rsquo;re feeling. To become numb and detached. And if I&rsquo;ve cut myself off from my own feelings, I&rsquo;m going to be less perceptive about what you&rsquo;re feeling, which means I&rsquo;m going to behave in a relationship with less skill and deftness.</p>\n<p><strong>Beck: </strong>These norms of masculinity have been entrenched in the culture for so long that it seems unlikely they would go completely away within a generation. But in the book, you&rsquo;re saying that positive relationships with parents or other mentors can be kind of a safe harbor for boys from all the madness swirling around out there, even if we can't get rid of the madness entirely. How does that work in practice?</p>\n<p><strong>Reichert:</strong> I think you're at the heart of it. I would say it a little differently: There are lots of signs that these cultural norms are shifting. I think this generation of boys is having a different experience and responding to a different set of opportunities than any prior generation. I teach this course in emotional literacy at a boys&rsquo; high school and I've been teaching it for 25 years. From what it was like when we started to what it&rsquo;s like now is a sea change. There used to be a lot of resistance, particularly on the part of the guys who subscribed more fully to the masculine norms&mdash;athletes, leaders. Now we have football players and actors and student leaders voluntarily coming to [the class] during their lunchtime. The present generation of boys understands and accepts their need to be savvy with their emotional lives.</p>\n<p>The power of a strong relationship with an ally like a mother, father, or teacher is that it strengthens the boy&rsquo;s core sense of who he is and therefore empowers him to resist the pressures of a culture that is trying to fit him into a box. Boys are picking these messages up. Sometimes they&rsquo;re being pulled in a direction that is unhealthy. For a boy to resist the pull of a peer culture trying to get him to go along with, for example, sexually objectifying girls and women&mdash;it helps to have a relational anchor. Someone really rooting him to a sense that he&rsquo;s known and loved.</p>\n<p><strong>Beck:</strong> You have two sons&mdash; what was on your mind when they were born and you were looking forward to raising them? Were you already having some of these concerns about boyhood at that time?</p>\n<p><strong>Reichert:</strong> I was. Back in the late &rsquo;70s and &rsquo;80s I was beginning to connect with the men&rsquo;s movement in the country. I was quite conscious of the fact that whatever was going on in male development wasn&rsquo;t working. I had a fundamental commitment with my first son to prioritize attachment parenting. It was important to me and my wife to make sure he had the strongest relationship with both his mom and his dad that we could manage. We spent a lot of special time with him, did a lot of strengthening of his emotional voice, making sure he expressed what he needed to. We wanted a boy who had his own mind, who was picking up that who he was mattered to us, that we were going to get to know <em>him</em> rather than merely requiring him to fit into what we expected a boy to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Beck: </strong>How do you think that went? Your sons are adults now, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Reichert:</strong> I think both of my sons benefited from that kind of parenting. They still have really strong connections with both of us. And they evidence a strong capacity to love other people and to establish intimate relationships. My son is the father of a two-and-a-half-year-old boy and he is a wonderful father. When my grandson says <em>Daddy</em>, the way he says the word, you can just tell it's coming from his heart. It resonates with real connection and delight.</p>\n<p><strong>Beck:</strong> Were there ever moments when your kids were growing up where you felt yourself falling into some of traps you&rsquo;d hoped to avoid? How did you work past them?</p>\n<p><strong>Reichert:</strong> Yeah, all the time. Ideas that I was unconscious of that resided in the back of my mind would pop out in these odd moments. One story is: My son had an early experience with bullying and got chased from the playground. I initially tried to build his self-confidence by sending him back to the playground to stand up for himself, and not settle for being driven from something he loved to do. One day when he came back home from the playground, defeated once again, I simply said, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come in. You have to go back and figure this out.&rdquo; And he had a huge emotional reaction. I wouldn&rsquo;t let him retreat, I didn&rsquo;t offer him safe harbor, I was making him go back and contend with these mean boys.</p>\n<p>On a conscious level, I was thinking, <em>You&rsquo;re doing the right thing; you're teaching him to stand up for himself; you&rsquo;re saying he doesn't have to let a defeat define his possibilities</em>. But I realized, when I reflected, that I was actually coming from a place where I was scared for him. I had these dire imaginings of a young man who was not going to be able to fend for himself in the dog-eat-dog world of boys&rsquo; peer culture. I was essentially trying to toughen my son up by passing along a lesson I had learned, and that my father had learned, and probably his father before him. Unconsciously, I was passing along a narrow vision that was about fitting into the peer culture rather than transcending it.</p>\n<p><strong>Beck:</strong> Once boys get to school, there is a lot more about their lives that parents can&rsquo;t control, and friends are one of those things. Obviously kids&rsquo; friends can be a positive or negative influence on them regardless of gender, but do you think that works in a different way for boys than for girls?</p>\n<p><strong>Reichert:</strong> Friendship is a critical influence on what boys are learning about cultural norms and permission to be yourself. Because of the way children are separated by gender beginning in elementary school, boys&rsquo; first friendships are often with other boys. They learn to practice skills of sharing and intimacy and connection with other boys well before they do it with girls. And we know from research that boys&rsquo; friendships can be rich and deep and life-sustaining. Boys will say, &ldquo;Without my friends I think I&rsquo;d die.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So there&rsquo;s a very positive side to male friendships that unfortunately becomes harder to maintain as boys get older and pick up cultural messages that they shouldn&rsquo;t be close to another boy because of homophobia. A lot of boys lose their friends in later adolescence, to their detriment. I know a lot of adult men who don&rsquo;t have any friends at all.</p>\n<p>But the downside of male friendships is really important to keep in mind, too. Norms that boys pick up in the peer group become a part of their normal. Whether it&rsquo;s substance use or misogyny or risk-taking, I think that hypermasculine peer-group norms can be a danger, particularly if the young man doesn&rsquo;t have some kind of mentor or parental figure grounding him in a connection, serving as a moral compass, almost.</p>\n<p><strong>Beck:</strong> In the book, you talk about how a bad reaction when boys act up or test authority can make them even more disconnected from their caretakers. What&rsquo;s a bad way to react, and what would a better way be?</p>\n<p><strong>Reichert:</strong> I&rsquo;ll speak first about schools. Boys in classroom settings are more willing to misbehave, to be defiant and disruptive, if they&rsquo;re not into the lesson, and girls in those classroom settings tend to be quieter or more willing to go along. And most discipline&mdash;detention, suspensions, expulsions&mdash;most of those are directed towards boys. When a boy is rejecting a teacher or challenging their authority, what the teacher feels is very negative. Instead of remembering that the boy is a child and the adult&rsquo;s job is to cultivate a connection with the boy, what teachers often do instead is suppress the boy; they exercise force and power for punishment.</p>\n<p>This is also true of parents. I have an awful lot of parents who seem to shut down or withdraw. I had a mom tell me today that her son is saying to her, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just so annoying, Mom,&rdquo; now that he&rsquo;s 12 years old. The mom begins to question herself:<em> Am I annoying? What&rsquo;s wrong with the way I'm approaching my son? Maybe I just don&rsquo;t get boys.</em> That kind of self-questioning causes parents to withdraw and even to give up&mdash;to come to believe that what the boy needs isn&rsquo;t connection, or at least not connection with me; maybe he needs his friends or he needs his coach. The outcome of that is the boy winds up alone.</p>\n<p>What I&rsquo;ve been training teachers to understand is that absent a relational connection, a boy is going to be disengaged from learning.

                "text": "In recent years, some of society\u2019s gender norms have begun to stretch and soften, while others cling fast. For many young boys, there continues to be a very small space that they can occupy to be considered traditionally \u201cmasculine,\u201d and that small space can be restricting, forcing boys to lose what doesn\u2019t fit inside it.\nIn his new book, How to Raise a Boy, Michael Reichert calls that space the \u201cman box.\u201d Reichert is a psychologist who specializes in boys and men, and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Lives at the University of Pennsylvania. His book is written as a guide to parents who want to create more space for their boys to express themselves. The key, he writes is \u201ca relationship in which a boy can tell that he matters \u2026 A young man\u2019s self confidence is not accidental or serendipitous but derives from experiences of being accurately understood, loved, and supported.\u201d\nI spoke with Reichert about how parents, teachers, and other adults can strengthen their relationships with boys, even when those boys act out, and in so doing help them create a broader expression of masculinity for themselves. An edited and condensed transcript of our conversation follows.\nJulie Beck: You write that \u201cboys\u2019 first disconnection is from themselves.\u201d What do you mean by that?\nMichael Reichert: I use a quote in my book from a George Orwell story called \u201cShooting an Elephant.\u201d He is a colonial policeman in Burma being asked to kill an elephant running amok in a village, and he is expected to do it without any show of hesitation or regret. The sentence he used to describe what that policeman experienced was: \u201cHe wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it.\u201d\nRequiring boys to differentiate what they show the world and what they feel inside happens really young. I have a two-and-a-half-year-old grandson who is already learning what's okay to show and what he has to keep to himself. A boy grows into that mask to the point where the mask becomes how he thinks of himself. He becomes cut off from his heart.\nThe first component of emotional intelligence is emotional awareness. But the rules of society mean that boys have to censor what they express, and sometimes the only way to do that is to convince yourself that you\u2019re not feeling what you\u2019re feeling. To become numb and detached. And if I\u2019ve cut myself off from my own feelings, I\u2019m going to be less perceptive about what you\u2019re feeling, which means I\u2019m going to behave in a relationship with less skill and deftness.\nBeck: These norms of masculinity have been entrenched in the culture for so long that it seems unlikely they would go completely away within a generation. But in the book, you\u2019re saying that positive relationships with parents or other mentors can be kind of a safe harbor for boys from all the madness swirling around out there, even if we can't get rid of the madness entirely. How does that work in practice?\nReichert: I think you're at the heart of it. I would say it a little differently: There are lots of signs that these cultural norms are shifting. I think this generation of boys is having a different experience and responding to a different set of opportunities than any prior generation. I teach this course in emotional literacy at a boys\u2019 high school and I've been teaching it for 25 years. From what it was like when we started to what it\u2019s like now is a sea change. There used to be a lot of resistance, particularly on the part of the guys who subscribed more fully to the masculine norms\u2014athletes, leaders. Now we have football players and actors and student leaders voluntarily coming to [the class] during their lunchtime. The present generation of boys understands and accepts their need to be savvy with their emotional lives.\nThe power of a strong relationship with an ally like a mother, father, or teacher is that it strengthens the boy\u2019s core sense of who he is and therefore empowers him to resist the pressures of a culture that is trying to fit him into a box. Boys are picking these messages up. Sometimes they\u2019re being pulled in a direction that is unhealthy. For a boy to resist the pull of a peer culture trying to get him to go along with, for example, sexually objectifying girls and women\u2014it helps to have a relational anchor. Someone really rooting him to a sense that he\u2019s known and loved.\nBeck: You have two sons\u2014 what was on your mind when they were born and you were looking forward to raising them? Were you already having some of these concerns about boyhood at that time?\nReichert: I was. Back in the late \u201970s and \u201980s I was beginning to connect with the men\u2019s movement in the country. I was quite conscious of the fact that whatever was going on in male development wasn\u2019t working. I had a fundamental commitment with my first son to prioritize attachment parenting. It was important to me and my wife to make sure he had the strongest relationship with both his mom and his dad that we could manage. We spent a lot of special time with him, did a lot of strengthening of his emotional voice, making sure he expressed what he needed to. We wanted a boy who had his own mind, who was picking up that who he was mattered to us, that we were going to get to know him rather than merely requiring him to fit into what we expected a boy to be.\nBeck: How do you think that went? Your sons are adults now, right?\nReichert: I think both of my sons benefited from that kind of parenting. They still have really strong connections with both of us. And they evidence a strong capacity to love other people and to establish intimate relationships. My son is the father of a two-and-a-half-year-old boy and he is a wonderful father. When my grandson says Daddy, the way he says the word, you can just tell it's coming from his heart. It resonates with real connection and delight.\nBeck: Were there ever moments when your kids were growing up where you felt yourself falling into some of traps you\u2019d hoped to avoid? How did you work past them?\nReichert: Yeah, all the time. Ideas that I was unconscious of that resided in the back of my mind would pop out in these odd moments. One story is: My son had an early experience with bullying and got chased from the playground. I initially tried to build his self-confidence by sending him back to the playground to stand up for himself, and not settle for being driven from something he loved to do. One day when he came back home from the playground, defeated once again, I simply said, \u201cYou can\u2019t come in. You have to go back and figure this out.\u201d And he had a huge emotional reaction. I wouldn\u2019t let him retreat, I didn\u2019t offer him safe harbor, I was making him go back and contend with these mean boys.\nOn a conscious level, I was thinking, You\u2019re doing the right thing; you're teaching him to stand up for himself; you\u2019re saying he doesn't have to let a defeat define his possibilities. But I realized, when I reflected, that I was actually coming from a place where I was scared for him. I had these dire imaginings of a young man who was not going to be able to fend for himself in the dog-eat-dog world of boys\u2019 peer culture. I was essentially trying to toughen my son up by passing along a lesson I had learned, and that my father had learned, and probably his father before him. Unconsciously, I was passing along a narrow vision that was about fitting into the peer culture rather than transcending it.\nBeck: Once boys get to school, there is a lot more about their lives that parents can\u2019t control, and friends are one of those things. Obviously kids\u2019 friends can be a positive or negative influence on them regardless of gender, but do you think that works in a different way for boys than for girls?\nReichert: Friendship is a critical influence on what boys are learning about cultural norms and permission to be yourself. Because of the way children are separated by gender beginning in elementary school, boys\u2019 first friendships are often with other boys. They learn to practice skills of sharing and intimacy and connection with other boys well before they do it with girls. And we know from research that boys\u2019 friendships can be rich and deep and life-sustaining. Boys will say, \u201cWithout my friends I think I\u2019d die.\u201d\nSo there\u2019s a very positive side to male friendships that unfortunately becomes harder to maintain as boys get older and pick up cultural messages that they shouldn\u2019t be close to another boy because of homophobia. A lot of boys lose their friends in later adolescence, to their detriment. I know a lot of adult men who don\u2019t have any friends at all.\nBut the downside of male friendships is really important to keep in mind, too. Norms that boys pick up in the peer group become a part of their normal. Whether it\u2019s substance use or misogyny or risk-taking, I think that hypermasculine peer-group norms can be a danger, particularly if the young man doesn\u2019t have some kind of mentor or parental figure grounding him in a connection, serving as a moral compass, almost.\nBeck: In the book, you talk about how a bad reaction when boys act up or test authority can make them even more disconnected from their caretakers. What\u2019s a bad way to react, and what would a better way be?\nReichert: I\u2019ll speak first about schools. Boys in classroom settings are more willing to misbehave, to be defiant and disruptive, if they\u2019re not into the lesson, and girls in those classroom settings tend to be quieter or more willing to go along. And most discipline\u2014detention, suspensions, expulsions\u2014most of those are directed towards boys. When a boy is rejecting a teacher or challenging their authority, what the teacher feels is very negative. Instead of remembering that the boy is a child and the adult\u2019s job is to cultivate a connection with the boy, what teachers often do instead is suppress the boy; they exercise force and power for punishment.\nThis is also true of parents. I have an awful lot of parents who seem to shut down or withdraw. I had a mom tell me today that her son is saying to her, \u201cYou\u2019re just so annoying, Mom,\u201d now that he\u2019s 12 years old. The mom begins to question herself: Am I annoying? What\u2019s wrong with the way I'm approaching my son? Maybe I just don\u2019t get boys. That kind of self-questioning causes parents to withdraw and even to give up\u2014to come to believe that what the boy needs isn\u2019t connection, or at least not connection with me; maybe he needs his friends or he needs his coach. The outcome of that is the boy winds up alone.\nWhat I\u2019ve been training teachers to understand is that absent a relational connection, a boy is going to be disengaged from learning. If you notice that a relationship has become weakened or broken between you and a student, your job as the relationship manager is to repair the breakdown. That job falls to the adult, not the child.\nSo when it comes to parents, I reiterate the same thing. You have the goods, you have what that boy needs. If he seems to be pushing you away at every turn, or critiquing your parenting, your job is not to buy it. You are not required to be perfect, but your job is to keep reaching for your son even when he\u2019s not giving you any indication you\u2019re on the right track. When a boy is misbehaving in some way, your job is to intervene, not for the sake of suppressing his misbehavior or punishing him, but to require him to face whatever emotional energy might be driving him off course.\nI know a lot of boys who push against their parents because they know that their parents\u2019 unconditional love means they can afford to display how angry or scared they feel with something else in their lives. They can\u2019t take it out against their teacher or peer group but they can show their parent.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

When I took over as chairman of the committee in January, there was no shortage of topics that would be obvious candidates for the committee to focus on&mdash;China&rsquo;s growing might, Russian interference in our election, Turkey&rsquo;s drift, or countless other threats. Our first hearing will not be on any of those topics, but rather on an issue that may surpass them all in importance, and yet underlies each: the rise of authoritarianism and the threat to liberal democracy around the world.</p>\n<p>Ronald Reagan once called America the &ldquo;shining city upon a hill.&rdquo; Today, our light of freedom is shining less brightly. Across the globe, democracies are mired in an ugly brand of populism often directed against &ldquo;the other,&rdquo; and are displaying a troubling receptivity to autocracy as an alternative model of governance. If these trends continue, it will be a tragedy for humankind and a disaster for our national security.</p>\n<p>The fight for freedom and democracy has been a long and arduous one. The blood of millions was spilled in the 20th century for the cause of democratic governance and respect for fundamental human rights. Out of the ashes of two world wars and the grinding decades of the Cold War, America looked across the globe and saw a world that seemed to be slowly, but irreversibly, becoming freer and more democratic. The world, it appeared, might finally become &ldquo;safe for democracy,&rdquo; in the words of President Woodrow Wilson.</p>\n<p>Our optimism was once again misplaced. The past decade has demonstrated that democratic change is not inevitable, but must be doggedly pursued by free societies. At present, democracies are backsliding the world over, with threats to the rule of law, freedom of the press, and independent civil society growing ever more severe. The unipolar moment of the 1990s has given way to an emboldened Russia headed by Vladimir Putin and an increasingly assertive China led by Xi Jinping, both bent on promoting their own brand of authoritarian rule through a combination of military might, cyber&ndash;informational warfare and theft, and the skillful use of economic leverage.</p>\n<p>In Caracas, Ankara, Budapest, Manila, Bras&iacute;lia, and elsewhere, strongmen have firmly grasped power. Rulers such as Viktor Orb&aacute;n and Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power through democratic means, but moved swiftly and brutally to centralize power and stamp out opposition. They have attacked the independent judiciary, the media, and the opposition political parties in their countries, waging campaigns of harassment, imprisonment, and violence. The Trump administration does not fully grasp the threat these trends portend to our national interest or what it means when treaty allies such as Hungary, Turkey, and the Philippines see their interests more closely aligned with those of our global adversaries in Moscow or Beijing than with those of the United States.</p>\n<p>There is no single cause for democratic retrenchment, but tectonic shifts in the global economy, the advent of the internet and new modes of communication, and the refugee crisis have helped fuel populist backlashes that empower autocratic rulers. These enormously disruptive societal changes&mdash;imagine the invention of the printing press and the Industrial Revolution taking place simultaneously&mdash;have tested the capacity of representative government, which by design moves with deliberation and trends toward moderation.</p>\n<p>At last week&rsquo;s national-security conference in Munich, our allies questioned America&rsquo;s commitment to our transatlantic alliance and our ideals. We must respond, clearly and without equivocation, in defense of our values and our democratic allies. We must be clear-eyed about these threats and recognize that human progress is not an inevitability, but will have to be won anew by each generation. Our diplomats, military, and intelligence agencies must have the support and resources they need to help America lead the free world, and to anticipate and respond when Russia, China, and others seek to extend their reach and undermine democratic societies.</p>\n<p>In his resignation letter as secretary of defense, James Mattis defined the stakes, writing that it was &ldquo;clear that China and Russia want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model.&rdquo; He also issued what, for the famously stolid Mattis, amounts to a cri de coeur<em>, </em>writing that &ldquo;while the U.S. remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It is this call that Americans&mdash;Democrats and Republicans&mdash;must answer.</p>\n<p>We want to hear what you think about this article. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/contact/letters/\">Submit a letter</a> to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.</p>",

                "text": "This week, the House Intelligence Committee will hold its first open hearing under the new Democratic majority. When I took over as chairman of the committee in January, there was no shortage of topics that would be obvious candidates for the committee to focus on\u2014China\u2019s growing might, Russian interference in our election, Turkey\u2019s drift, or countless other threats. Our first hearing will not be on any of those topics, but rather on an issue that may surpass them all in importance, and yet underlies each: the rise of authoritarianism and the threat to liberal democracy around the world.\nRonald Reagan once called America the \u201cshining city upon a hill.\u201d Today, our light of freedom is shining less brightly. Across the globe, democracies are mired in an ugly brand of populism often directed against \u201cthe other,\u201d and are displaying a troubling receptivity to autocracy as an alternative model of governance. If these trends continue, it will be a tragedy for humankind and a disaster for our national security.\nThe fight for freedom and democracy has been a long and arduous one. The blood of millions was spilled in the 20th century for the cause of democratic governance and respect for fundamental human rights. Out of the ashes of two world wars and the grinding decades of the Cold War, America looked across the globe and saw a world that seemed to be slowly, but irreversibly, becoming freer and more democratic. The world, it appeared, might finally become \u201csafe for democracy,\u201d in the words of President Woodrow Wilson.\nOur optimism was once again misplaced. The past decade has demonstrated that democratic change is not inevitable, but must be doggedly pursued by free societies. At present, democracies are backsliding the world over, with threats to the rule of law, freedom of the press, and independent civil society growing ever more severe. The unipolar moment of the 1990s has given way to an emboldened Russia headed by Vladimir Putin and an increasingly assertive China led by Xi Jinping, both bent on promoting their own brand of authoritarian rule through a combination of military might, cyber\u2013informational warfare and theft, and the skillful use of economic leverage.\nIn Caracas, Ankara, Budapest, Manila, Bras\u00edlia, and elsewhere, strongmen have firmly grasped power. Rulers such as Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power through democratic means, but moved swiftly and brutally to centralize power and stamp out opposition. They have attacked the independent judiciary, the media, and the opposition political parties in their countries, waging campaigns of harassment, imprisonment, and violence. The Trump administration does not fully grasp the threat these trends portend to our national interest or what it means when treaty allies such as Hungary, Turkey, and the Philippines see their interests more closely aligned with those of our global adversaries in Moscow or Beijing than with those of the United States.\nThere is no single cause for democratic retrenchment, but tectonic shifts in the global economy, the advent of the internet and new modes of communication, and the refugee crisis have helped fuel populist backlashes that empower autocratic rulers. These enormously disruptive societal changes\u2014imagine the invention of the printing press and the Industrial Revolution taking place simultaneously\u2014have tested the capacity of representative government, which by design moves with deliberation and trends toward moderation.\nAt last week\u2019s national-security conference in Munich, our allies questioned America\u2019s commitment to our transatlantic alliance and our ideals. We must respond, clearly and without equivocation, in defense of our values and our democratic allies. We must be clear-eyed about these threats and recognize that human progress is not an inevitability, but will have to be won anew by each generation. Our diplomats, military, and intelligence agencies must have the support and resources they need to help America lead the free world, and to anticipate and respond when Russia, China, and others seek to extend their reach and undermine democratic societies.\nIn his resignation letter as secretary of defense, James Mattis defined the stakes, writing that it was \u201cclear that China and Russia want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model.\u201d He also issued what, for the famously stolid Mattis, amounts to a cri de coeur, writing that \u201cwhile the U.S. remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies.\u201d\nIt is this call that Americans\u2014Democrats and Republicans\u2014must answer.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

The dream of a comprehensive federal program that would liberate working parents from having to scrap for a seat in a safe, clean child-care facility that will provide for their little ones for a full day, and all for a price so low as to be negligible, has obvious appeal across the Democratic Party&rsquo;s class divide. But it&rsquo;s also an object lesson in the unseriousness of how we think about social policy. Instead of just helping working families, her proposal risks increasing the federal deficit, driving up the cost of child care, and squeezing stay-at-home parents. And that last risk is one Warren should understand particularly well because she made her reputation as a public intellectual by warning against it.</p>\n<p>There is no question that a lack of affordable child care is a thorny problem facing almost all working parents, especially those who can&rsquo;t rely on extended family members or other informal arrangements to meet their needs. This is true not only for low-income families, for whom access to affordable child care can be a matter of economic survival, but also for a not-inconsiderable number of affluent professionals, not least those residing in high-cost cities, where well-intentioned licensing and training requirements can combine with labor and land costs to render even rather spartan day-care options prohibitively expensive.</p>\n<p>With this bleak landscape very much in mind, Warren proposes that households earning 200 percent of the federal poverty line would pay absolutely nothing for child care, and that those earning more than that would have their fees limited to no more than 7 percent of their income. Given that many high-income households pay many multiples of that amount for child care now, this would be nothing short of a bonanza for them, assuming the child care in question is as high-quality as advertised.</p>\n<p>Yet this is where our brows should start furrowing. If costs are capped at 7 percent of household income for better-off families, what reason would they have to shop around, and what reason would the new day-care facilities that would surely spring up to take advantage of this new federal program have to contain their costs? As far as their customers are concerned, any expenditures that push the underlying cost of providing day care above the 7 percent of their income they&rsquo;d be obliged to pay would be of no interest&mdash;indeed, they&rsquo;re to be encouraged, insofar as they contribute to a more salubrious day-care experience for their kids.</p>\n<p>One assumes that the federal government would eventually seek to impose various cost-control mechanisms to keep its spending on the program from spiraling upward, as it has in <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'\" href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/02/22/medicare-for-all-cost-m4a-debt-bernie\">the case of Medicare</a>. In principle, the federal government could do some good by, say, voiding burdensome state and local regulations that contribute to high and rising child-care costs, though of course the federal government could presumably take such bold action now if lawmakers were so inclined, and at minimal budgetary cost.</p>\n<p>But if we&rsquo;ve learned anything from efforts to control rising Medicare expenditures, it is that <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-cost-of-hospital-protectionism\">providers that come to depend on government largesse can do an awfully good job of extracting more of it over time</a>, especially when the populations they&rsquo;re serving are sympathetic. Lawmakers are notably reluctant to strip benefits from the elderly population served by Medicare, and it&rsquo;s not a stretch to assume that they&rsquo;d feel much the same way about the small children who&rsquo;ve been signed up for federally subsidized day care, and more precisely, about their loving parents.</p>\n<p>In fairness, Warren claims that her child-care plan could easily be paid for by her proposed &ldquo;<a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'\" href=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-plan-for-universal-child-care-762535e6c20a\">ultra-millionaire tax</a>.&rdquo; Leaving aside the fact that this new federal wealth tax is <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'\" href=\"https://medium.com/whatever-source-derived/how-to-tax-wealth-constitutionally-863ce992ac7e\">very unlikely to pass constitutional muster</a>&mdash;this is where the new enthusiasm for <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/progressive-activists-pack-supreme-court-1182792\">court packing</a> would come in, I assume&mdash;Warren expects it to raise $2.75 trillion in new federal revenue over the next 10 years, a truly impressive-sounding sum. To put this number in context, consider that federal deficits are expected to exceed $2 trillion per annum by the end of the next decade, and that <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'\" href=\"http://www.crfb.org/papers/analysis-cbos-january-2019-budget-and-economic-outlook\">debt held by the public is expected to increase by $12.5 trillion over the next 10 years under current law</a>.</p>\n<p>Spending on social-insurance programs will increase sharply as the U.S. population ages, longevity increases, and expensive new medical therapies continue to emerge. Closing future federal deficits with a wealth tax would require importing a slew of new ultra-millionaires from another dimension and then taxing them with abandon, and that&rsquo;s before we start contemplating Medicare for all or a Green New Deal, let alone a new federal child-care program.</p>\n<p>But imagine for a moment that Warren&rsquo;s federal child-care program could indeed be paid for, and that fretting over cost control is a hateful exercise. Even then, there would still be reason to tread lightly. In the late 1990s, the Canadian province of Quebec embarked on an eerily familiar experiment. To better the lives of parents and children alike, its government offered heavily subsidized child care at an out-of-pocket price of $5 a day. In short order, Quebec families flocked to the new program, including many who had previously relied on more informal child-care arrangements.</p>\n<p>The results were, on one level, a great success. Labor-force participation surged among mothers in the province, which was one of the Quebec policy&rsquo;s chief objectives. As the <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w21571\">economists Michael Baker, Jonathan Gruber, and Kevin Milligan have found</a>, however, the outcomes for the children enrolled in the program were less encouraging. In a 2015 working paper, they reported that the Quebec policy appeared to have had &ldquo;a lasting negative impact on the non-cognitive skills of exposed children,&rdquo; one that was particularly pronounced among boys. Needless to say, the findings of Baker et al. are hardly the last word on the subject, and it is certainly possible that a federal child-care program in the United States would yield far superior results, perhaps by drawing on some of the lessons of the Quebec experience. But we can&rsquo;t dismiss the results of the Quebec policy as the result of negligence or incompetence.

                "text": "Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s call for a new federal child-care program is nothing if not shrewd. The dream of a comprehensive federal program that would liberate working parents from having to scrap for a seat in a safe, clean child-care facility that will provide for their little ones for a full day, and all for a price so low as to be negligible, has obvious appeal across the Democratic Party\u2019s class divide. But it\u2019s also an object lesson in the unseriousness of how we think about social policy. Instead of just helping working families, her proposal risks increasing the federal deficit, driving up the cost of child care, and squeezing stay-at-home parents. And that last risk is one Warren should understand particularly well because she made her reputation as a public intellectual by warning against it.\nThere is no question that a lack of affordable child care is a thorny problem facing almost all working parents, especially those who can\u2019t rely on extended family members or other informal arrangements to meet their needs. This is true not only for low-income families, for whom access to affordable child care can be a matter of economic survival, but also for a not-inconsiderable number of affluent professionals, not least those residing in high-cost cities, where well-intentioned licensing and training requirements can combine with labor and land costs to render even rather spartan day-care options prohibitively expensive.\nWith this bleak landscape very much in mind, Warren proposes that households earning 200 percent of the federal poverty line would pay absolutely nothing for child care, and that those earning more than that would have their fees limited to no more than 7 percent of their income. Given that many high-income households pay many multiples of that amount for child care now, this would be nothing short of a bonanza for them, assuming the child care in question is as high-quality as advertised.\nYet this is where our brows should start furrowing. If costs are capped at 7 percent of household income for better-off families, what reason would they have to shop around, and what reason would the new day-care facilities that would surely spring up to take advantage of this new federal program have to contain their costs? As far as their customers are concerned, any expenditures that push the underlying cost of providing day care above the 7 percent of their income they\u2019d be obliged to pay would be of no interest\u2014indeed, they\u2019re to be encouraged, insofar as they contribute to a more salubrious day-care experience for their kids.\nOne assumes that the federal government would eventually seek to impose various cost-control mechanisms to keep its spending on the program from spiraling upward, as it has in the case of Medicare. In principle, the federal government could do some good by, say, voiding burdensome state and local regulations that contribute to high and rising child-care costs, though of course the federal government could presumably take such bold action now if lawmakers were so inclined, and at minimal budgetary cost.\nBut if we\u2019ve learned anything from efforts to control rising Medicare expenditures, it is that providers that come to depend on government largesse can do an awfully good job of extracting more of it over time, especially when the populations they\u2019re serving are sympathetic. Lawmakers are notably reluctant to strip benefits from the elderly population served by Medicare, and it\u2019s not a stretch to assume that they\u2019d feel much the same way about the small children who\u2019ve been signed up for federally subsidized day care, and more precisely, about their loving parents.\nIn fairness, Warren claims that her child-care plan could easily be paid for by her proposed \u201cultra-millionaire tax.\u201d Leaving aside the fact that this new federal wealth tax is very unlikely to pass constitutional muster\u2014this is where the new enthusiasm for court packing would come in, I assume\u2014Warren expects it to raise $2.75 trillion in new federal revenue over the next 10 years, a truly impressive-sounding sum. To put this number in context, consider that federal deficits are expected to exceed $2 trillion per annum by the end of the next decade, and that debt held by the public is expected to increase by $12.5 trillion over the next 10 years under current law.\nSpending on social-insurance programs will increase sharply as the U.S. population ages, longevity increases, and expensive new medical therapies continue to emerge. Closing future federal deficits with a wealth tax would require importing a slew of new ultra-millionaires from another dimension and then taxing them with abandon, and that\u2019s before we start contemplating Medicare for all or a Green New Deal, let alone a new federal child-care program.\nBut imagine for a moment that Warren\u2019s federal child-care program could indeed be paid for, and that fretting over cost control is a hateful exercise. Even then, there would still be reason to tread lightly. In the late 1990s, the Canadian province of Quebec embarked on an eerily familiar experiment. To better the lives of parents and children alike, its government offered heavily subsidized child care at an out-of-pocket price of $5 a day. In short order, Quebec families flocked to the new program, including many who had previously relied on more informal child-care arrangements.\nThe results were, on one level, a great success. Labor-force participation surged among mothers in the province, which was one of the Quebec policy\u2019s chief objectives. As the economists Michael Baker, Jonathan Gruber, and Kevin Milligan have found, however, the outcomes for the children enrolled in the program were less encouraging. In a 2015 working paper, they reported that the Quebec policy appeared to have had \u201ca lasting negative impact on the non-cognitive skills of exposed children,\u201d one that was particularly pronounced among boys. Needless to say, the findings of Baker et al. are hardly the last word on the subject, and it is certainly possible that a federal child-care program in the United States would yield far superior results, perhaps by drawing on some of the lessons of the Quebec experience. But we can\u2019t dismiss the results of the Quebec policy as the result of negligence or incompetence. Its designers were serious, thoughtful people who wanted to do right by Quebec families, yet their experiment had decidedly mixed results. It would be foolish to discount the possibility that the same might happen south of the border.\nThen there is the fact that, as Patrick Brown observes in the latest issue of National Review, a large number of parents would much prefer to care for their children at home than to enroll them in day care. A 2015 Gallup survey found that 56 percent of mothers with children under the age of 18 reported that they would \u201cideally like to stay home and care for their house and family,\u201d a number that might well be higher for the parents of young children.\nWarren\u2019s proposed federal child-care program would do nothing for stay-at-home mothers and fathers. Indeed, the sheer size of the benefit is such that it would nudge many parents who\u2019d otherwise prefer to devote all of their time and energy to raising their children into the workforce. Apart from the fact that this would mean privileging one normative conception of family life over another, a controversial proposition in itself, another danger lurks. By boosting parental labor-force participation, a federal child-care program along these lines could boost household incomes (a good thing), which in turn could drive up home prices in neighborhoods with high-quality schools (a less good thing), thereby setting off a series of \u201cfrenzied bidding wars\u201d that compel all two-parent families to become two-earner families, whether they want to or not. Or at least that\u2019s what Warren and her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, argued in their provocative book The Two-Income Trap, published in 2003. At the time, Warren was a professor at Harvard Law School known for her deep interest in the financial fragility of middle-income families and, unusually for academics of her stature, for her heterodox political sensibilities, which blended economic populism with a culturally conservative streak. Judging by her child-care proposal, that Warren has been replaced by someone else entirely.\nNone of this is to suggest that there\u2019s no room to improve federal child-care policy. One can imagine other approaches that could do more good at a lower cost. In 2017, Grover J. Whitehurst, formerly of the Brookings Institution, proposed a new child-care-and-education savings account (CESA) that would be financed by repurposing existing federal funds devoted to child care and by trimming tax expenditures. Targeted at low-income households, Whitehurst\u2019s CESA has a carryover provision that would encourage families to spend their child-care dollars wisely while not leaving stay-at-home parents out in the cold. It is the opposite of a one-size-fits-all policy, and it is one that could command broad support across the political spectrum. Overshadowed by chimerical promises of free lunches for all, CESA deserves a long look from Warren\u2019s rivals, and from all those who want a federal child-care policy that is fiscally sustainable and fair to all families.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

She was born in New Jersey and raised in Alabama, where she was studying for a business degree. Her father <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/gone-girl-an-interview-with-an-american-in-isis#.yieV4BvpKQ\">described her</a> as religious, but worried that she might be surreptitiously talking to boys. That&rsquo;s why few would have predicted that she would withdraw from the University of Alabama in 2014 and make her way to ISIS-controlled territory in Syria.</p>\n<p>Now, with ISIS confined to a tiny pocket of Syria, Muthana says that she wants to return to the United States with her 18-month-old son.

Stripping someone of U.S. citizenship is not uncommon: The government has &ldquo;denaturalized,&rdquo; or revoked the citizenship of, hundreds of former Nazis for lying on application forms about their political affiliations, as well as other people who have committed immigration fraud. What is different in Muthana&rsquo;s case is that the government has, in effect, retroactively stripped her of recognition as a citizen.</p>\n<p>&quot;That should be incredibly terrifying,&quot; Swift told me. &quot;If they can do this to Hoda, they can do it to anyone.&quot;</p>\n<p>This is a striking demonstration of the U.S. government&rsquo;s ability to determine citizenship and its rights. Immigrants have prized American citizenship because, among other things, it accords their U.S.-born children the same rights and opportunities as other native-born Americans. It also offers the protection of the rule of law that their home countries sometimes lack. Muthana&rsquo;s case illustrates how illusory those protections could be.</p>\n<p>This is hardly the first such case in recent years. Since the start of the War on Terror in 2001, civil-liberties groups have complained about government actions against Americans that appear to deprive them of their rights. President George W. Bush&rsquo;s administration was criticized for holding Jos&eacute; Padilla, an American citizen, as an enemy combatant for three and a half years without trial. President Barack Obama was condemned over the mass surveillance of citizens, and excoriated for the drone strike in 2011 that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born radical preacher. His teenage son, also an American citizen, was killed two weeks later in another strike.</p>\n<p>Muthana&rsquo;s case bears some similarities to that of Shamima Begum, who traveled to ISIS-controlled Syria with two friends. She too is now in a camp. She too has a child. And she can't return to her family either. The British government stripped Begum of her citizenship, saying that she possessed Bangladeshi nationality as well, though the Bangladeshi government says that it will not admit her because she has never been a citizen. Begum&rsquo;s and Muthanna&rsquo;s cases might appear isolated, but they represent a political dilemma for Western nations that are grappling with what to do with their citizens who joined ISIS or moved to the group&rsquo;s territory: Bring them back and try them for their actions while inflaming political debate at home, or strip them of their citizenship and be seen as weakening the rule of law.</p>\n<p>In Muthana&rsquo;s case, the consequences extend further still. The government&rsquo;s position, that she was never eligible for citizenship, is a contentious one because, on the face of it, the facts surrounding her case aren&rsquo;t controversial. Muthana was born on October 28, 1994, in Hackensack, New Jersey, to Ahmed Ali Muthana and his wife.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration&rsquo;s move centers on Muthana&rsquo;s father. A former Yemeni diplomat, his position ended on September 1, 1994, more than a month before Hoda was born (the children of diplomats posted to the United States are ineligible for birthright citizenship).</p>\n<p>According to the government, though, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations wasn&rsquo;t officially notified that Ahmed Ali Muthana had left his diplomatic position until February 6, 1995, more than three months after his daughter was born. According to the lawsuit, the government maintained that this means he wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;within the jurisdiction of the United States,&rdquo; and so his daughter was not an American citizen. In other words, the case against Muthana appears to hinge on a filing delay.</p>\n<p>The date of the government&rsquo;s letter, January 15, 2016, suggests it was issued in the final days of Obama&rsquo;s presidency. The Trump administration appears to be following the Obama administration&rsquo;s legal justification for denying Muthana citizenship.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit filed on behalf of Muthana&rsquo;s father against President Trump, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Attorney General William Barr says that the government&rsquo;s rationale &ldquo;contradicts [the government&rsquo;s] prior interpretations of the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations that diplomatic immunity terminates at the time the diplomat&rsquo;s position is terminated.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has not publicly disclosed its legal logic for saying Muthana isn&rsquo;t a citizen. The State Department did not respond to an email seeking comment about its position. Last week, Pompeo said in a statement that Muthana &ldquo;does not have any legal basis, no valid U.S. passport, no right to a passport, nor any visa to travel to the United States.&rdquo; Yet according to the lawsuit, she was issued passports twice: in 2005 and in 2014.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government has in the past rendered people ineligible for citizenship because of a parent&rsquo;s diplomatic work, Steve Vladeck, a professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law, told me. In one such case, <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2512708/raya-v-clinton/\">the daughter of an Egyptian diplomat</a> sued Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, in 2010 over the State Department's refusal to issue her a passport. A lower court sided with the State Department because the woman's father had been a diplomat at the time of her birth in 1981.</p>\n<p>The impact of Muthana&rsquo;s case rests on how the government responds to the latest lawsuit: If the White House bases its argument on Ahmed Ali Muthana&rsquo;s diplomatic status, then the dispute&rsquo;s impact will be limited. But if the case becomes a referendum on whether a citizen can be denied reentry into the United States, then it can have major repercussions. Swift, the lawyer, told me that the administration&rsquo;s position would essentially allow Muthana to escape the legal consequences of her actions. Muthana herself has <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/islamic-state-american-women.html\">told the<em> Times</em></a> that she knows what she faces if she is allowed to enter the United States.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I ruined my life,&rdquo; she told the paper. &ldquo;I ruined my future.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/02/hoda-muthana-isis-american-citizenship/583645/\">*</a> This article originally stated that 59 American men went to fight for ISIS, and that nearly all of them had been repatriated.</p>\n<p>We want to hear what you think about this article. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/contact/letters/\">Submit a letter</a> to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.</p>",

                "text": "Updated at 4:20 a.m. ET on February 28, 2019.\nHoda Muthana\u2019s story is not unlike that of other children of immigrants. She was born in New Jersey and raised in Alabama, where she was studying for a business degree. Her father described her as religious, but worried that she might be surreptitiously talking to boys. That\u2019s why few would have predicted that she would withdraw from the University of Alabama in 2014 and make her way to ISIS-controlled territory in Syria.\nNow, with ISIS confined to a tiny pocket of Syria, Muthana says that she wants to return to the United States with her 18-month-old son. In doing so, she has triggered a dispute that could have far-reaching implications for American citizens the world over.\nMuthana, who now lives in a displaced-persons camp in Syria, says she is prepared to face justice for her actions, which include sending tweets that exhorted Americans to commit acts of violence. The Trump administration argues, however, that not only is Muthana not an American citizen, but she was never eligible to be one, and so she cannot enter the United States. A lawsuit filed last week by Muthana\u2019s father on her behalf at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenges that assertion, setting up a legal battle.\nMuthana\u2019s case raises broad questions about the protections Americans enjoy under the law, and whether a certain class of immigrants has a higher burden of citizenship. By no means are these questions new: They have been debated since well before the internment of Japanese American citizens during World War II. But the potential return of hundreds of citizens who joined ISIS or went to live in its self-proclaimed caliphate is forcing Western governments to reexamine their citizenship laws\u2014partly because they have few legal avenues to deal with those who are returning. (A similar case in Britain is prompting an analogous debate there.)\nThe New York Times notes that nearly all of the captured American men who went to fight for ISIS have been repatriated, but at least 13 American women and children have not\u2014including Muthana, whose case is compounded by the fact that the Trump administration is denying the citizenship of someone the government had previously recognized as a citizen.*\nThe United States is among a small number of countries that offer what is known as birthright citizenship, and Charles Swift, Muthana\u2019s lawyer and the director of the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America, contends that by virtue of her birth in New Jersey, Muthana is an American citizen. Stripping someone of U.S. citizenship is not uncommon: The government has \u201cdenaturalized,\u201d or revoked the citizenship of, hundreds of former Nazis for lying on application forms about their political affiliations, as well as other people who have committed immigration fraud. What is different in Muthana\u2019s case is that the government has, in effect, retroactively stripped her of recognition as a citizen.\n\"That should be incredibly terrifying,\" Swift told me. \"If they can do this to Hoda, they can do it to anyone.\"\nThis is a striking demonstration of the U.S. government\u2019s ability to determine citizenship and its rights. Immigrants have prized American citizenship because, among other things, it accords their U.S.-born children the same rights and opportunities as other native-born Americans. It also offers the protection of the rule of law that their home countries sometimes lack. Muthana\u2019s case illustrates how illusory those protections could be.\nThis is hardly the first such case in recent years. Since the start of the War on Terror in 2001, civil-liberties groups have complained about government actions against Americans that appear to deprive them of their rights. President George W. Bush\u2019s administration was criticized for holding Jos\u00e9 Padilla, an American citizen, as an enemy combatant for three and a half years without trial. President Barack Obama was condemned over the mass surveillance of citizens, and excoriated for the drone strike in 2011 that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born radical preacher. His teenage son, also an American citizen, was killed two weeks later in another strike.\nMuthana\u2019s case bears some similarities to that of Shamima Begum, who traveled to ISIS-controlled Syria with two friends. She too is now in a camp. She too has a child. And she can't return to her family either. The British government stripped Begum of her citizenship, saying that she possessed Bangladeshi nationality as well, though the Bangladeshi government says that it will not admit her because she has never been a citizen. Begum\u2019s and Muthanna\u2019s cases might appear isolated, but they represent a political dilemma for Western nations that are grappling with what to do with their citizens who joined ISIS or moved to the group\u2019s territory: Bring them back and try them for their actions while inflaming political debate at home, or strip them of their citizenship and be seen as weakening the rule of law.\nIn Muthana\u2019s case, the consequences extend further still. The government\u2019s position, that she was never eligible for citizenship, is a contentious one because, on the face of it, the facts surrounding her case aren\u2019t controversial. Muthana was born on October 28, 1994, in Hackensack, New Jersey, to Ahmed Ali Muthana and his wife.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s move centers on Muthana\u2019s father. A former Yemeni diplomat, his position ended on September 1, 1994, more than a month before Hoda was born (the children of diplomats posted to the United States are ineligible for birthright citizenship).\nAccording to the government, though, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations wasn\u2019t officially notified that Ahmed Ali Muthana had left his diplomatic position until February 6, 1995, more than three months after his daughter was born. According to the lawsuit, the government maintained that this means he wasn\u2019t \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d and so his daughter was not an American citizen. In other words, the case against Muthana appears to hinge on a filing delay.\nThe date of the government\u2019s letter, January 15, 2016, suggests it was issued in the final days of Obama\u2019s presidency. The Trump administration appears to be following the Obama administration\u2019s legal justification for denying Muthana citizenship.\nThe lawsuit filed on behalf of Muthana\u2019s father against President Trump, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Attorney General William Barr says that the government\u2019s rationale \u201ccontradicts [the government\u2019s] prior interpretations of the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations that diplomatic immunity terminates at the time the diplomat\u2019s position is terminated.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has not publicly disclosed its legal logic for saying Muthana isn\u2019t a citizen. The State Department did not respond to an email seeking comment about its position. Last week, Pompeo said in a statement that Muthana \u201cdoes not have any legal basis, no valid U.S. passport, no right to a passport, nor any visa to travel to the United States.\u201d Yet according to the lawsuit, she was issued passports twice: in 2005 and in 2014.\nThe U.S. government has in the past rendered people ineligible for citizenship because of a parent\u2019s diplomatic work, Steve Vladeck, a professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law, told me. In one such case, the daughter of an Egyptian diplomat sued Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, in 2010 over the State Department's refusal to issue her a passport. A lower court sided with the State Department because the woman's father had been a diplomat at the time of her birth in 1981.\nThe impact of Muthana\u2019s case rests on how the government responds to the latest lawsuit: If the White House bases its argument on Ahmed Ali Muthana\u2019s diplomatic status, then the dispute\u2019s impact will be limited. But if the case becomes a referendum on whether a citizen can be denied reentry into the United States, then it can have major repercussions. Swift, the lawyer, told me that the administration\u2019s position would essentially allow Muthana to escape the legal consequences of her actions. Muthana herself has told the Times that she knows what she faces if she is allowed to enter the United States.\n\u201cI ruined my life,\u201d she told the paper. \u201cI ruined my future.\u201d\n* This article originally stated that 59 American men went to fight for ISIS, and that nearly all of them had been repatriated.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

It was from a stranger claiming to be her half sibling. She assumed the message was some kind of scam; her parents had never told her she might have siblings. But the message contained one detail that spooked her. The sender mentioned a doctor, Donald Cline. Woock knew that name; her mother had gone to Cline for fertility treatments before she was born. Had this person somehow gotten her mother&rsquo;s medical history?</p>\n<p><i>To hear more feature stories, <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'583249'\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/audio-articles/?utm_source=audioarticleembed\">see our full list</a> or <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'583249'\" href=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=soundcloud&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=atlantic&utm_content=fertility_secret\">get the Audm iPhone app.</a> </i></p>\n<p>Her mom said not to worry. So Woock, who is 33 and lives just outside Indianapolis, flew to the West Coast for her vacation. She got a couple more messages from other supposed half siblings while she was away. Their persistence was strange. But then her phone broke, and she spent the next week and a half outdoors in Seattle and Vancouver, blissfully disconnected.</p>\n<p>It was only when she got home and replaced her phone that she saw the barrage of messages from even more half siblings. They had found her on Facebook, she realized, after searching for the username linked to her Ancestry.com account. Her husband had given her a DNA test for Christmas because she was interested in genealogy. Her heritage turned out to be exactly what she had thought&mdash;Scottish, with English, Irish, and Scandinavian mixed in&mdash;and she never bothered to click on the link that would show whether anyone on the site shared her DNA.</p>\n<p>Apparently she did have relatives on Ancestry.com&mdash;and not just distant cousins. The people now sending her messages said they were Cline&rsquo;s secret biological children. They said their parents had also been treated by Cline. They said that decades ago, without ever telling his patients, Cline had used his own sperm to impregnate women who came to him for artificial insemination.</p>\n<p>According to her DNA, Woock, too, was one of his children.</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_HeatherWoock1/cb7f677de.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_HeatherWoock1/cb7f677de.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_HeatherWoock1/cb7f677de.jpg\"></img></picture><figcaption>Heather Woock came back from vacation to find a barrage of messages from her half siblings. (Alyssa Schukar)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the time since Woock&rsquo;s half siblings got in touch with her, they have broken the news dozens more times. The children Cline fathered with his patients now number at least 50, confirmed by DNA tests from 23andMe or Ancestry.com.<a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'583249'\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/fertility-doctor-donald-cline-secret-children/583249/\">*</a> (Several have a twin or other siblings who likely share the same biological father but haven&rsquo;t been tested.) They keep in touch through a Facebook group. New siblings pop up in waves, timed perversely after holidays like Christmas or Mother&rsquo;s Day or Father&rsquo;s Day, when DNA tests are given as well-intentioned gifts.</p>\n<p>Like Woock, many of her new siblings learned that they were donor-conceived from a DNA test. (Woock&rsquo;s parents eventually told her they&rsquo;d gone to Cline for donor insemination, but they&rsquo;d had no idea <i>he </i>was the donor.) And in their shock, many also thought the initial messages explaining the situation were part of a scam. But eventually they found news clips laying out that, yes, this doctor deceived his patients, and yes, he used his own sperm, and yes, <i>this is really happening</i>.</p>\n<p>At least those finding out now have the benefit of clarity. They won&rsquo;t have to wander through a thicket of confusion, half-truths, and lies. They won&rsquo;t have to sit across from Cline, as some of the others did, and listen to him quote Bible verses. They won&rsquo;t be accused of libel.</p>\n<p>Jacoba Ballard was one of the first to piece everything together, and it had taken a long time. She&rsquo;d known she was donor-conceived since the age of 10, and in 2014, when she was 33, she began looking for half siblings who shared her donor. &ldquo;I was thinking one, or two at the most,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, finding her first half siblings was too easy. She signed up for an online forum for adoptees and donor-conceived children, and quickly met another woman whose mother had also been treated by Cline. She looked the woman up on Facebook and saw her photos. &ldquo;I was like, <i>Oh my goodness, I think that is my sister</i>, &rdquo; Ballard says. That woman knew another woman whose mother had also gone to Cline, and she had a sister. They all decided to take 23andMe tests. DNA confirmed that they were half sisters and revealed four more matches, bringing the number of half siblings to eight.</p>\n<p>A story began to emerge from the DNA, but it contradicted the one Cline had told his patients. He&rsquo;d said the donors he used were medical residents. He&rsquo;d said he used each donor for only three successful pregnancies. But 23andMe showed that he&rsquo;d used one donor at least eight times, and the birth years of the resulting children ranged from 1979 to 1986. Medical residencies last only a few years. What resident would be around to donate sperm for that entire seven-year period?</p>\n<p>The answer, Ballard and her half siblings assumed, was in their DNA. No one in the 23andMe database shared enough DNA with them to be their father, but they found dozens of more distant genetic matches. By combing through public records and social-media profiles, and some times simply asking genetic matches about their families, they could build a giant family tree that, they hoped, would eventually lead to their father. Thousands of adoptees and donor-conceived children have used this method to find their biological parents, and forensic genealogists now use it to investigate cold cases like that of the Golden State Killer.</p>\n<aside>Jacoba Ballard struggled with what it meant, existentially, to have inherited the DNA of a man who would lie to his patients. Whatever made him do it, was that inside her, too?</aside>\n<p>As Ballard and her half siblings researched their family tree, one suspiciously familiar name kept coming up: Cline. Finally, a woman who shared some of their DNA told them she had a cousin named Donald Cline who was a doctor in Indianapolis.</p>\n<p>Even then, Ballard says, they weren&rsquo;t sure Cline was their father. Maybe he had a brother or another male relative who&rsquo;d served as the donor. Four of the eight siblings decided to file complaints with Indiana&rsquo;s attorney general, saying they suspected that Cline had used his own sperm in patients and asking for an investigation. Ballard contacted a reporter for a local TV station, Fox59, which aired a segment about the unusually high number of kids from one sperm donor but stopped short of naming Cline as that donor.</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_Jacoba/a8b809fa6.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_Jacoba/a8b809fa6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_Jacoba/a8b809fa6.jpg\"></img></picture><figcaption>Jacoba Ballard was part of the original group that figured out what Donald Cline had done. (Alyssa Schukar)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For months, nothing much happened. Then one of Ballard&rsquo;s half sisters went for it. She found Cline&rsquo;s children&mdash;those he raised with his wife&mdash;and his adult grandchildren on Facebook and sent them a group message. A granddaughter replied, saying she didn&rsquo;t know anything and couldn&rsquo;t help.</p>\n<p>But then, Ballard says, she got a message from Cline&rsquo;s son. He had been looking through her Facebook photos and recognized her priest&mdash;he said he was Catholic too. He helped broker a meeting between his father and six of the siblings at a restaurant. Cline, who was then in his late 70s, walked in with a cane.</p>\n<p>Ballard remembers this first family reunion of sorts as oddly matter-of-fact. Cline admitted to using his own sperm but said the records had been destroyed years ago. He asked each of the siblings what they did and where they lived. He read them Bible verses from a notepad. Ballard saw this as a misguided attempt to comfort her, and she snapped at him: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to use my religion.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Here was her biological father, but he radiated no paternal warmth. Ballard struggled with what it meant, existentially, to have inherited the DNA of a man who would lie to his patients and abuse his position as a doctor. Whatever made him do it, was that inside her, too? She knew the thought wasn&rsquo;t entirely rational, but she couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that a dark impulse might be lurking deep within her.</p>\n<p>And what <i>did</i> make him do it? The half siblings turned the question over in their minds. Was it a religious thing? A sexual one?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A need to implement this master race or something?&rdquo; one speculated.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just this science experiment to him,&rdquo; another suggested.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He wanted to have control over, I don&rsquo;t know, Indiana?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He had to maintain his business.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know. I have no clue.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;God complex.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Maybe he really thought he was helping people. Maybe he&rsquo;s that delusional.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When Donald Cline opened his clinic in 1979, infertility was a relatively new medical specialty. There were no big sperm banks yet, no catalogs of donors to select by eye color or hobby. Doctors usually found donors themselves, often among medical trainees, who had the advantage of being readily available in hospitals and had reputations as successful young men. (In those days, medical students were nearly all men.)</p>\n<p>Sperm donation was shrouded in secrecy from the beginning. In 1884, a doctor named William Pancoast found himself unable to cure a wealthy man in Philadelphia who was struggling with infertility. Not one to give up, Pancoast tried something new. After sedating the man&rsquo;s wife with chloroform, he injected her with semen from his best-looking medical student. This was the first documented case of successful donor insemination. Pancoast told the husband only afterwards, and the man agreed to never tell his wife. The end justified the means. The healthy baby justified the lie.</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_Clinic/67eaf5f25.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_Clinic/67eaf5f25.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_Clinic/67eaf5f25.jpg\"></img></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_Dr-2/f4236d195.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_Dr-2/f4236d195.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_Dr-2/f4236d195.jpg\"></img></picture><figcaption>Donald Cline opened his clinic (top) in 1979, when fertility was a relatively new specialty. (Alyssa Schukar)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>By the 1970s, hundreds of doctors were performing donor insemination across the U.S., but secrecy still prevailed. Doctors advised parents not to tell their children. A 1977 survey found that more than half of the doctors did not even keep records, so as to leave no paper trail connecting donor and child. The secrecy sprang in part from uncertainty over who would be the legal father of a donor-conceived child, a question that hadn&rsquo;t yet been resolved in the laws of many states. But it also came from fear of doing psychological harm. &ldquo;The child might feel rejected, the sterile husband might feel humiliated, and the wife might be condemned as an adultress,&rdquo; Kara Swanson, a professor at the Northeastern University School of Law, recounts in her book, <i>Banking on the Body</i>.</p>\n<p>When Liz White walked into Donald Cline&rsquo;s office with her husband in 1981, she carried the weight of all this inside her. She spoke of their infertility troubles with almost no one else. It was only 35 years later&mdash;when Cline was in the news&mdash;that she and her best friend realized they had both gone to him. He was <i>the</i> fertility specialist in Indianapolis at the time. His patients saw him as a kind, gentle man. His office was decorated with photos of babies he&rsquo;d helped conceive&mdash;a mundane detail that seems unsettling in retrospect.</p>\n<p>White and her husband had been trying to conceive for two and a half years by the time they sought Cline&rsquo;s help. They&rsquo;d already seen another doctor, who&rsquo;d attempted insemination with frozen donor sperm. When that didn&rsquo;t work, the doctor recommended Cline, who used fresh sperm, which at the time had higher success rates. Cline said he would find a medical resident whose appearance and blood type matched White&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s. He also said not to tell anyone, not even their future child, about the sperm donation.</p>\n<p>White is 66 now, and when I met her this past fall, she greeted me at the door of her home barefoot and with her white hair pulled into a neat updo. Her house, in Zionsville, a town just outside of Indianapolis, was meticulously ordered, and her words were meticulously chosen. She told me Cline had inseminated her 15 times over five months. &ldquo;I went October, November, December of &rsquo;81; January of &rsquo;82, and February,&rdquo; she said, nodding her head as she ticked off the dates. She went to his office on the three days she was ovulating each month. Ovulation cycles cannot be changed for convenience&rsquo;s sake, so she went in even on weekends. She remembers lying there alone in a gown, the clinic otherwise empty, and now she wonders what he was doing when he went next door to get the sample.</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_LizWhite/faeb0d89c.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_LizWhite/faeb0d89c.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_LizWhite/faeb0d89c.jpg\"></img></picture><figcaption>Liz White was one of Donald Cline&rsquo;s patients. (Alyssa Schukar)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Until very recently in human history, reproduction always required an act of sexual intimacy. We elide this fact now, with consent forms and dense clinical language and gynecological tools that look brutishly utilitarian. But artificial insemination still requires an exchange of bodily fluids that can be procured only through sexual stimulation. (Consider: the stereotypical drawer of porn magazines at the fertility doctor&rsquo;s office.) To have your doctor masturbate in his office and then to have that same doctor sit between your legs, injecting his sperm inside you&mdash;the edifice separating the clinical and the sexual breaks down completely.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to say exactly what went on inside Cline&rsquo;s mind then. (I went to his house to interview him, but he said his lawyers had advised him not to talk. His attorneys did not respond to a request for comment.) Some of his donor children told me their mothers did not think of Cline&rsquo;s actions as sexual when they found out the truth. Some mothers did not think about it much at all.</p>\n<aside> <figure><a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r' ',d,'relatedmag',r' ',r'201904'\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2019/04/\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/issues/2019/03/13/0419_Cover/420.jpg?1552502125\"></img></a> </figure><p>Subscribe to <i>The Atlantic</i> and support 160 years of independent journalism</p> </aside>\n<p>But White replayed the sequence of events in her mind. She thought of him masturbating in his office. She is a clinical social worker, and she slipped into clinical language to describe what she thought: &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s mind following ejaculation&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot of dopamine, a lot of serotonin and norepinephrine. All of those are mood enhancers that bring about wonderful feelings for them.&rdquo; She continued: &ldquo;We came in for a medical procedure.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>More than three decades later, she now says, &ldquo;I feel like I was raped 15 times.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In those same three decades, the mores around sex, assisted reproduction, and medical authority have changed, too. When the news about Cline came out, the medical community denounced his actions. &ldquo;It was a breach of trust between a physician and his patient. One could say immoral,&rdquo; says Robert Colver, an Indiana fertility specialist who knew Cline. &ldquo;All of us were shocked.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Would it have been as shocking 30 years ago? In 1987, a national survey of fertility doctors found that 2 percent had used their own sperm in patients. On one hand, it was clearly not the norm. On the other, it couldn&rsquo;t have been so beyond the pale if it was presented as an option in a multiple-choice survey. The survey did not ask, however, whether the patients in those cases were aware that their doctor was also their sperm donor.</p>\n<p>I asked Colver, who has been practicing since the 1980s, how such a deception could even occur to a doctor. He had trouble answering, but he noted that procuring sperm was a much more tedious and time-sensitive process back then. Cline has said he inseminated within the hour to maximize a sample&rsquo;s viability. That would have meant coordinating the schedule of the sperm donor with the appointment of the ovulating patient several days a month, every month. Cline was a top fertility doctor in Indianapolis; he had a lot of patients.</p>\n<p>Based on the birth dates of his youngest known donor children, Cline stopped using his own sperm in the late 1980s, when sperm banks became more common. (The whole industry started relying on frozen sperm then, because doctors had discovered that HIV could be transmitted through fresh sperm.) When Cline later got into legal trouble, his friends and family members wrote letters to the judge about how difficult it must have been for him to disappoint patients when a donor couldn&rsquo;t be found. A friend whose wife was a patient of Cline&rsquo;s&mdash;but did not have children through donor insemination&mdash;wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>Dr. Cline&rsquo;s always put his patients first. Empathetic and full of compassion, he sought ways to help families through this most tender period when both husband and wife feel helpless &hellip; We can also empathize with the couple waiting expectantly because the time is right, and can understand the devastation that would wash upon them if there would be no viable sperm donor at that critical moment.</blockquote>\n<p>If his friends saw this as an exculpatory explanation, those angry with Cline saw something uglier. They saw not selflessness but selfishness. They saw a doctor who cared more about his professional success than his patients&rsquo; well-being. They saw a man too comfortable in his power. If he truly believed he was doing nothing wrong, why did he deceive his patients?</p>\n<p>Colver was more measured. He said he understood the reluctance to disappoint a patient. &ldquo;Is it sad that month to say, &lsquo;Unfortunately, Mrs. Jones, [the donor] couldn&rsquo;t come because of an emergency. So sorry, we&rsquo;re going to have to wait until next month&rsquo;?&rdquo; Of course it is. But consider the alternative: &ldquo;To tell Mrs. Jones versus 30 years later having it come out like this. There&rsquo;s really no comparison between the two.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Liz White carries around a photo of herself in 1982, beaming in a hospital bed with a baby boy in her arms. She named him Matthew, &ldquo;gift from God,&rdquo; because she thought of the sperm donation as a gift then. She is 30 in the photo. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how young I was,&rdquo; she told me, which I took to mean: <i>I know you see an old woman now, but I was young and vulnerable and alone with the man</i>.</p>\n<p>Matt figured it out before his mom did. After four of the half siblings filed their complaints with the Indiana attorney general, the Fox59 reporter, Angela Ganote, asked the local prosecutor about Cline. Her inquiry led to a criminal investigation. In September 2016, Ganote broke the news that Cline had been charged with two counts of felony obstruction of justice, and Matt&mdash;along with the rest of the public&mdash;learned what Cline had done.</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_LizWhiteBabyPhoto/5bff3cb94.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_LizWhiteBabyPhoto/5bff3cb94.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_LizWhiteBabyPhoto/5bff3cb94.jpg\"></img></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_MattWhite/dbeeaef95.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_MattWhite/dbeeaef95.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_MattWhite/dbeeaef95.jpg\"></img></picture><figcaption>Matt White was born in 1982. His mother chose his name because it means &ldquo;gift from God,&rdquo; and that was how she thought of the sperm donation at the time. (Alyssa Schukar)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Matt already knew he was donor-conceived. Back in high-school biology class, he&rsquo;d realized that his blood type didn&rsquo;t match his parents&rsquo;. They sat him down and told him about the sperm donor, and no one really thought too hard about how Cline had promised that the donor&rsquo;s blood type would match Matt&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s. White remembers feeling bad for his dad then, but the revelation provoked no deep identity crisis. His mother would sometimes point out a building when they drove down 86th Street in Indianapolis: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I got pregnant with you.&rdquo; She thought of it as a joyous place. After Matt saw Cline in the news, he looked up the address. It was Cline&rsquo;s old office. A DNA test confirmed what he already knew deep down. The resemblance between Matt and a young Cline is uncanny. They could be the same person.</p>\n<p>Over the next year, Matt and his newfound half siblings watched the criminal case against Cline unfold. He wasn&rsquo;t charged with rape. He wasn&rsquo;t charged with battery with bodily waste&mdash;Indiana considers that a crime only if it&rsquo;s done &ldquo;in a rude, insolent, or angry manner.&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t charged with criminal deception&mdash;any records were long gone. In fact, Cline wasn&rsquo;t charged for anything he did almost four decades ago. No law in Indiana&mdash;or in most other states, for that matter&mdash;specifically forbids a doctor from using his own sperm in his patients.</p>\n<aside>Cline violated the trust of his patients, but did he also wrong their children, who wouldn&rsquo;t exist if not for his deception?</aside>\n<p>Prosecutors charged Cline with two counts of obstruction of justice: He had received letters from the attorney general&rsquo;s office notifying him of the investigation, and had written back at least twice saying he&rsquo;d never used his own sperm and that any woman who said otherwise was &ldquo;guilty of slander and/or libel.&rdquo; This was easy to disprove. Investigators showed up at Cline&rsquo;s house with a search warrant for his DNA. They swabbed his mouth, and that was that.</p>\n<p>In the 1980s, before anyone dreamed up mail-in DNA tests and internet genealogy sites, Cline must have thought no one would ever find out. As he faced the consequences now, he seemed to believe that he could make the whole mess go away by denying it with the full force of his being. Tim DeLaney, the prosecutor in this case, told me he saw the original wrong as a transgression by a person in power. When Cline was accused, DeLaney said, &ldquo;he went to that same position of power and basically said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a doctor. These people are lying. They have defamed me.&rsquo; It wasn&rsquo;t the reaction of a scared, powerless person. It was the reaction of a person used to being powerful.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What particularly galled some of the siblings was how Cline used his faith as deflection. By all accounts, he is a very religious man&mdash;for his sentencing, several elders from his evangelical church wrote letters attesting to his character. After the restaurant meeting, Cline called Ballard to say her digging up the past was destroying his marriage: His wife considered his actions adultery. In the call, which Ballard recorded, Cline told her he regretted what he&rsquo;d done&mdash;though he admitted to using his own sperm only nine or 10 times&mdash;and quoted Jeremiah 1:5, in which God lays out his plan for the prophet: &ldquo;Before I formed you in your mother&rsquo;s womb, I knew you.&rdquo; Again, Ballard felt he was using her faith to try to manipulate her.</p>\n<p>Cline was ultimately fined $500 and given a year of probation. He lost his medical license, but he&rsquo;d been retired since 2009. If he hadn&rsquo;t replied to the attorney general&rsquo;s letters&mdash;which he had been under no obligation to do&mdash;he might have gotten off entirely. (Several of the donor-conceived children and their mothers have also filed civil lawsuits against Cline.)</p>\n<p>DeLaney knows that some of the half siblings were angry that he only charged Cline with obstruction of justice, but he didn&rsquo;t think he could prove any other crime in court. He still thinks about the case often. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s by far the most philosophically interesting of any case I ever had,&rdquo; he said. Cline violated the trust of his patients, but did he also wrong their children, who wouldn&rsquo;t exist if not for Cline&rsquo;s deception?</p>\n<p>For Matt White, watching all this play out awoke a sense of purpose. He&rsquo;d dealt with infertility himself; his own two kids were conceived through sperm donation&mdash;the modern version, with online catalogs and donors&rsquo; baby photos. That gave him a sense of what his mother had gone through to have him. He understood why she felt violated.</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_MattAndLiz/142218afc.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_MattAndLiz/142218afc.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_MattAndLiz/142218afc.jpg\"></img></picture><figcaption>Matt and Liz White review documents related to Cline&rsquo;s case; they have been advocating for a state law that would make actions like his illegal. (Alyssa Schukar)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I met White, now 36, at a bakery in Indianapolis last November, the morning after the first storm of the season had shellacked the roads in ice. The day before, he and his mother and several of his half siblings had had a meeting with the president pro tempore of the Indiana Senate, Rodric Bray. The senator had introduced a fertility-fraud bill inspired by Cline&rsquo;s case the previous session, but it had died without a vote. Now the siblings were trying to revive the bill, which would make it illegal for doctors to use reproductive material improperly, and White had become the group&rsquo;s unofficial leader. It helped that his office was two blocks from the statehouse. He could pop over for meetings.</p>\n<p>White knows that many people may see Cline&rsquo;s case as a one-off, just the strange behavior of a lone doctor out in Indiana. But a handful of other doctors have also been accused of secretly using their own sperm&mdash;in Connecticut, Virginia, Idaho, Vermont, and Canada. CeCe Moore, a genealogist who has helped adoptees and donor-conceived children find family, told me she&rsquo;s come across enough cases of fertility doctors using their own sperm that &ldquo;when I see these large groups of half siblings, it&rsquo;s actually the first thing I think about now.&rdquo; Many of the sibling groups have chosen to stay private, and their reactions run the gamut. Some siblings &ldquo;think very highly of their donor father, his &lsquo;contributions&rsquo; to their mothers,&rdquo; Moore said. &ldquo;Some are horrified by it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>White was among those horrified, obviously. His mother contacted Jody Madeira, a law professor at Indiana University at Bloomington who has studied bioethics and reproductive medicine. Madeira took an interest in the case and helped write the fertility-fraud bill. &ldquo;When you talk to people about the Cline case, it&rsquo;s a physiological reaction of disgust, the sense that it&rsquo;s deeply, morally wrong,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Is it legally wrong? It should be.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Many of the children Cline fathered still live in Indianapolis, and they find themselves accidentally running into his family. At the bakery where we met, White pointed straight ahead. Cline, he said, &ldquo;lives down the street over there. I live down the street over there, and my mom lives in town here.&rdquo; Cline&rsquo;s daughter-in-law is an ob-gyn at the practice White&rsquo;s wife goes to. He thinks he saw Cline&rsquo;s daughter, a nurse who worked in Cline&rsquo;s practice, at Subway once. He got sick to his stomach and walked out. His mom saw the same daughter at a nail salon; she was getting a pedicure and couldn&rsquo;t get up to walk away.</p>\n<p>The donor children have begun cataloging the ways their own paths have crossed, too. White went to Purdue at the same time as one of his half brothers. One sibling sold another a wagon at a garage sale. Two of them lived on the same street. Two had kids on the same softball team. They&rsquo;re worried that their children are getting old enough to date soon. &ldquo;Did you not consider we all live in a relatively close area?&rdquo; one sister said she has wondered about Cline. &ldquo;Did you really think &hellip; that we wouldn&rsquo;t meet? That we wouldn&rsquo;t maybe date? That we wouldn&rsquo;t have kids who might date? Did you never consider that?&rdquo; Cline now looms over their kids&rsquo; every innocent crush, their every prom date.</p>\n<p>Cline has admitted to using his own sperm about 50 times, which is about the number of children who have been identified through DNA. More may be out there, though&mdash;DNA testing is common but nowhere near ubiquitous. During the time I corresponded with his donor children, every few weeks one of them would tell me that another sibling had been found. In the fall, they started sending letters to Indiana legislators urging them to support the fertility-fraud bill. (It was introduced in the general assembly, and seemed to be gaining momentum.) In early January, White texted me to say he had sealed a batch of letters to legislators the night before, only to find two more siblings. He was going to add a note on the envelopes.</p>\n<p>White&rsquo;s updates about new siblings always seemed to come with a mix of anger and sadness: anger at the growing scope of Cline&rsquo;s misdeeds, sadness for each additional family being turned upside down by a decades-old secret. But each new half sibling has dealt with the revelation in his or her own way.</p>\n<p>The same Christmas Heather Woock got her DNA test, she&rsquo;d made her father a book tracing his genealogy, all the way up to Scottish royalty. Losing the genetic connection with her father meant losing the story she had literally written about who she was and how she came to be. It&rsquo;s this identity crisis&mdash;more than Cline&rsquo;s inexplicable actions&mdash;that she&rsquo;s still working through. The hardest part, she says, is &ldquo;processing that my parents outright lied to me throughout my childhood.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Kylene Gott, a 38-year-old teacher from Indianapolis, was in the car with her mom when she revealed that Cline was her biological father. Her mother&rsquo;s response: &ldquo;Well, good.&rdquo; <i>Well, good?</i> &ldquo;If it was going to be anyone, I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s him.&rdquo; Gott says her mom later talked about having seen pictures of Cline&rsquo;s kids on the wall and how pretty they were, and how intelligent. She had wanted kids like that. But her response upset Gott, who believed her origin story explained the dislocation she&rsquo;d felt her whole life in jobs and in social situations. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t really known who I am; that&rsquo;s why I haven&rsquo;t been able to figure out what I&rsquo;m supposed to do in the world,&rdquo; she says. She was thrilled to have new half siblings, and she dissected their lives for similarities, from favorite McDonald&rsquo;s orders to the bouquets in their wedding photos.</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_Sisters/9c3321501.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_Sisters/9c3321501.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/WEL_Zhang_Sisters/9c3321501.jpg\"></img></picture><figcaption>Three more of Cline&rsquo;s biological children (from left to right): Julie Harmon, Kylene Gott, and Amber Stafford. (Alyssa Schukar)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another woman in Indianapolis, whom I&rsquo;ll call Amy, told me her mother was strangely calm when she heard about Cline. (Some of the donor children asked me not to use their real names, because they hadn&rsquo;t told everyone in their lives about their paternity.) Her mom&rsquo;s reaction was especially unnerving because Amy thought Cline was supposed to have used her father&rsquo;s sperm, not a donor&rsquo;s, and this deception struck her as even more grotesque. A few weeks after we spoke, Amy emailed to say we had to talk. She had confronted her mother, who revealed that she&rsquo;d always known it was a donor, if not Cline himself. When Amy was conceived, her parents had promised never to tell&mdash;a promise her mom had kept even though Amy&rsquo;s father died years ago. Amy wishes she&rsquo;d never learned the truth. &ldquo;Ignorance is bliss,&rdquo; she told me, wistfully drawing out the last word.</p>\n<p>A man I&rsquo;ll call Tyler, who is a construction manager in Washington, D.C., told me that his mother, too, said she&rsquo;d thought Cline had used her husband&rsquo;s sperm. But, oddly, she didn&rsquo;t seem angry at Cline so much as angry at being found out. She made Tyler swear never to tell his dad. &ldquo;You and I gotta take it to the grave,&rdquo; she said. Tyler now wonders whether she knew all along that the sperm came from a donor, even if she didn&rsquo;t know that donor was Cline. He still hasn&rsquo;t talked with his dad about it.</p>\n<p>Joseph (not his real name) has a twin brother, but they look nothing alike. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taller than him. He outweighs me by 30 pounds,&rdquo; he says. They have different personalities, too. When Joseph took a DNA test in 2017 and discovered his paternity, he and his twin briefly wondered whether they had different fathers, because Cline had told their mother he&rsquo;d mixed a donor&rsquo;s sperm with her husband&rsquo;s. But no: They both had Cline&rsquo;s DNA. True to their different personalities, they reacted in opposite ways. Joseph has been very involved with the Facebook group, while his twin wants nothing to do with it. Strangest of all, Joseph met a half brother who looks exactly like him&mdash;much more so than his actual twin.</p>\n<aside data-omni-click=\"r'article',r' ',d,r'related',#data-omni-index,@data-article-id\"> <figure><a data-article-id=\"2380414\" data-omni-click=\"inherit\" data-omni-index=\"0\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/12/donor-sibling-network-alumni/577294/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/12/GettyImages_698786324/thumb_wide_medium.jpg?1543941449\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/12/donor-sibling-network-alumni/577294/\">The Changing Norms Around Donor-Sibling Networks</a></figcaption></figure> </aside>\n<p>They are just a few of the many people forging connections after the initial shock of a DNA surprise. Adoptees have reunited with their birth families. Donor-conceived children have found their biological fathers. And half siblings have met one another, creating new iterations of family entirely different from the traditional family unit their parents were seeking when they went to a fertility doctor.</p>\n<p>In June of last year, on Father&rsquo;s Day weekend, the siblings gathered in Indiana for their second annual picnic. They&rsquo;d been getting together in smaller groups, for holidays, girls&rsquo; nights, lunches, and meetings with state legislators. But this was the big shebang. Tyler flew in for the day from Washington. Spouses and children came too. Matt rented out a picnic pavilion, and brought name tags because many of the siblings were meeting for the first time. Their numbers had almost tripled since the previous year.</p>\n<p>Everyone pitched in a little. One sibling brought a birthday cake, which was becoming a tradition. Kylene brought chips and salsa. Amy made pasta salad. Heather thought to bring much-needed packs of bottled water. Matt brought chicken wings, and he sweated over the grill cooking them. It was a hot day. Their kids ran through sprinklers. They climbed trees and got sticky with sap. From afar, it must have looked like any family reunion.</p>\n<p><i>This article appears in the April 2019 print edition with the headline &ldquo;The Fertility Doctor&rsquo;s Secret.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p><i><a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'583249'\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/fertility-doctor-donald-cline-secret-children/583249/\">*</a>This article has been updated to reflect the fact that, as of March 18, 2019, two more half siblings have been confirmed by DNA testing.</i></p>",

                "text": "Updated at 5:23 p.m. ET on March 18, 2019.\nThe first Facebook message arrived when Heather Woock was packing for vacation, in August 2017. It was from a stranger claiming to be her half sibling. She assumed the message was some kind of scam; her parents had never told her she might have siblings. But the message contained one detail that spooked her. The sender mentioned a doctor, Donald Cline. Woock knew that name; her mother had gone to Cline for fertility treatments before she was born. Had this person somehow gotten her mother\u2019s medical history?\nTo hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app.\nHer mom said not to worry. So Woock, who is 33 and lives just outside Indianapolis, flew to the West Coast for her vacation. She got a couple more messages from other supposed half siblings while she was away. Their persistence was strange. But then her phone broke, and she spent the next week and a half outdoors in Seattle and Vancouver, blissfully disconnected.\nIt was only when she got home and replaced her phone that she saw the barrage of messages from even more half siblings. They had found her on Facebook, she realized, after searching for the username linked to her Ancestry.com account. Her husband had given her a DNA test for Christmas because she was interested in genealogy. Her heritage turned out to be exactly what she had thought\u2014Scottish, with English, Irish, and Scandinavian mixed in\u2014and she never bothered to click on the link that would show whether anyone on the site shared her DNA.\nApparently she did have relatives on Ancestry.com\u2014and not just distant cousins. The people now sending her messages said they were Cline\u2019s secret biological children. They said their parents had also been treated by Cline. They said that decades ago, without ever telling his patients, Cline had used his own sperm to impregnate women who came to him for artificial insemination.\nAccording to her DNA, Woock, too, was one of his children.\nIn the time since Woock\u2019s half siblings got in touch with her, they have broken the news dozens more times. The children Cline fathered with his patients now number at least 50, confirmed by DNA tests from 23andMe or Ancestry.com.* (Several have a twin or other siblings who likely share the same biological father but haven\u2019t been tested.) They keep in touch through a Facebook group. New siblings pop up in waves, timed perversely after holidays like Christmas or Mother\u2019s Day or Father\u2019s Day, when DNA tests are given as well-intentioned gifts.\nLike Woock, many of her new siblings learned that they were donor-conceived from a DNA test. (Woock\u2019s parents eventually told her they\u2019d gone to Cline for donor insemination, but they\u2019d had no idea he was the donor.) And in their shock, many also thought the initial messages explaining the situation were part of a scam. But eventually they found news clips laying out that, yes, this doctor deceived his patients, and yes, he used his own sperm, and yes, this is really happening.\nAt least those finding out now have the benefit of clarity. They won\u2019t have to wander through a thicket of confusion, half-truths, and lies. They won\u2019t have to sit across from Cline, as some of the others did, and listen to him quote Bible verses. They won\u2019t be accused of libel.\nJacoba Ballard was one of the first to piece everything together, and it had taken a long time. She\u2019d known she was donor-conceived since the age of 10, and in 2014, when she was 33, she began looking for half siblings who shared her donor. \u201cI was thinking one, or two at the most,\u201d she says.\nIn retrospect, finding her first half siblings was too easy. She signed up for an online forum for adoptees and donor-conceived children, and quickly met another woman whose mother had also been treated by Cline. She looked the woman up on Facebook and saw her photos. \u201cI was like, Oh my goodness, I think that is my sister, \u201d Ballard says. That woman knew another woman whose mother had also gone to Cline, and she had a sister. They all decided to take 23andMe tests. DNA confirmed that they were half sisters and revealed four more matches, bringing the number of half siblings to eight.\nA story began to emerge from the DNA, but it contradicted the one Cline had told his patients. He\u2019d said the donors he used were medical residents. He\u2019d said he used each donor for only three successful pregnancies. But 23andMe showed that he\u2019d used one donor at least eight times, and the birth years of the resulting children ranged from 1979 to 1986. Medical residencies last only a few years. What resident would be around to donate sperm for that entire seven-year period?\nThe answer, Ballard and her half siblings assumed, was in their DNA. No one in the 23andMe database shared enough DNA with them to be their father, but they found dozens of more distant genetic matches. By combing through public records and social-media profiles, and some times simply asking genetic matches about their families, they could build a giant family tree that, they hoped, would eventually lead to their father. Thousands of adoptees and donor-conceived children have used this method to find their biological parents, and forensic genealogists now use it to investigate cold cases like that of the Golden State Killer.\nJacoba Ballard struggled with what it meant, existentially, to have inherited the DNA of a man who would lie to his patients. Whatever made him do it, was that inside her, too?\nAs Ballard and her half siblings researched their family tree, one suspiciously familiar name kept coming up: Cline. Finally, a woman who shared some of their DNA told them she had a cousin named Donald Cline who was a doctor in Indianapolis.\nEven then, Ballard says, they weren\u2019t sure Cline was their father. Maybe he had a brother or another male relative who\u2019d served as the donor. Four of the eight siblings decided to file complaints with Indiana\u2019s attorney general, saying they suspected that Cline had used his own sperm in patients and asking for an investigation. Ballard contacted a reporter for a local TV station, Fox59, which aired a segment about the unusually high number of kids from one sperm donor but stopped short of naming Cline as that donor.\nFor months, nothing much happened. Then one of Ballard\u2019s half sisters went for it. She found Cline\u2019s children\u2014those he raised with his wife\u2014and his adult grandchildren on Facebook and sent them a group message. A granddaughter replied, saying she didn\u2019t know anything and couldn\u2019t help.\nBut then, Ballard says, she got a message from Cline\u2019s son. He had been looking through her Facebook photos and recognized her priest\u2014he said he was Catholic too. He helped broker a meeting between his father and six of the siblings at a restaurant. Cline, who was then in his late 70s, walked in with a cane.\nBallard remembers this first family reunion of sorts as oddly matter-of-fact. Cline admitted to using his own sperm but said the records had been destroyed years ago. He asked each of the siblings what they did and where they lived. He read them Bible verses from a notepad. Ballard saw this as a misguided attempt to comfort her, and she snapped at him: \u201cDon\u2019t try to use my religion.\u201d\nHere was her biological father, but he radiated no paternal warmth. Ballard struggled with what it meant, existentially, to have inherited the DNA of a man who would lie to his patients and abuse his position as a doctor. Whatever made him do it, was that inside her, too? She knew the thought wasn\u2019t entirely rational, but she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that a dark impulse might be lurking deep within her.\nAnd what did make him do it? The half siblings turned the question over in their minds. Was it a religious thing? A sexual one?\n\u201cA need to implement this master race or something?\u201d one speculated.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just this science experiment to him,\u201d another suggested.\n\u201cHe wanted to have control over, I don\u2019t know, Indiana?\u201d\n\u201cHe had to maintain his business.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know. I have no clue.\u201d\n\u201cGod complex.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he really thought he was helping people. Maybe he\u2019s that delusional.\u201d\nWhen Donald Cline opened his clinic in 1979, infertility was a relatively new medical specialty. There were no big sperm banks yet, no catalogs of donors to select by eye color or hobby. Doctors usually found donors themselves, often among medical trainees, who had the advantage of being readily available in hospitals and had reputations as successful young men. (In those days, medical students were nearly all men.)\nSperm donation was shrouded in secrecy from the beginning. In 1884, a doctor named William Pancoast found himself unable to cure a wealthy man in Philadelphia who was struggling with infertility. Not one to give up, Pancoast tried something new. After sedating the man\u2019s wife with chloroform, he injected her with semen from his best-looking medical student. This was the first documented case of successful donor insemination. Pancoast told the husband only afterwards, and the man agreed to never tell his wife. The end justified the means. The healthy baby justified the lie.\nBy the 1970s, hundreds of doctors were performing donor insemination across the U.S., but secrecy still prevailed. Doctors advised parents not to tell their children. A 1977 survey found that more than half of the doctors did not even keep records, so as to leave no paper trail connecting donor and child. The secrecy sprang in part from uncertainty over who would be the legal father of a donor-conceived child, a question that hadn\u2019t yet been resolved in the laws of many states. But it also came from fear of doing psychological harm. \u201cThe child might feel rejected, the sterile husband might feel humiliated, and the wife might be condemned as an adultress,\u201d Kara Swanson, a professor at the Northeastern University School of Law, recounts in her book, Banking on the Body.\nWhen Liz White walked into Donald Cline\u2019s office with her husband in 1981, she carried the weight of all this inside her. She spoke of their infertility troubles with almost no one else. It was only 35 years later\u2014when Cline was in the news\u2014that she and her best friend realized they had both gone to him. He was the fertility specialist in Indianapolis at the time. His patients saw him as a kind, gentle man. His office was decorated with photos of babies he\u2019d helped conceive\u2014a mundane detail that seems unsettling in retrospect.\nWhite and her husband had been trying to conceive for two and a half years by the time they sought Cline\u2019s help. They\u2019d already seen another doctor, who\u2019d attempted insemination with frozen donor sperm. When that didn\u2019t work, the doctor recommended Cline, who used fresh sperm, which at the time had higher success rates. Cline said he would find a medical resident whose appearance and blood type matched White\u2019s husband\u2019s. He also said not to tell anyone, not even their future child, about the sperm donation.\nWhite is 66 now, and when I met her this past fall, she greeted me at the door of her home barefoot and with her white hair pulled into a neat updo. Her house, in Zionsville, a town just outside of Indianapolis, was meticulously ordered, and her words were meticulously chosen. She told me Cline had inseminated her 15 times over five months. \u201cI went October, November, December of \u201981; January of \u201982, and February,\u201d she said, nodding her head as she ticked off the dates. She went to his office on the three days she was ovulating each month. Ovulation cycles cannot be changed for convenience\u2019s sake, so she went in even on weekends. She remembers lying there alone in a gown, the clinic otherwise empty, and now she wonders what he was doing when he went next door to get the sample.\nUntil very recently in human history, reproduction always required an act of sexual intimacy. We elide this fact now, with consent forms and dense clinical language and gynecological tools that look brutishly utilitarian. But artificial insemination still requires an exchange of bodily fluids that can be procured only through sexual stimulation. (Consider: the stereotypical drawer of porn magazines at the fertility doctor\u2019s office.) To have your doctor masturbate in his office and then to have that same doctor sit between your legs, injecting his sperm inside you\u2014the edifice separating the clinical and the sexual breaks down completely.\nIt\u2019s impossible to say exactly what went on inside Cline\u2019s mind then. (I went to his house to interview him, but he said his lawyers had advised him not to talk. His attorneys did not respond to a request for comment.) Some of his donor children told me their mothers did not think of Cline\u2019s actions as sexual when they found out the truth. Some mothers did not think about it much at all.\nSubscribe to The Atlantic and support 160 years of independent journalism\nBut White replayed the sequence of events in her mind. She thought of him masturbating in his office. She is a clinical social worker, and she slipped into clinical language to describe what she thought: \u201cA man\u2019s mind following ejaculation\u2014there\u2019s a lot of dopamine, a lot of serotonin and norepinephrine. All of those are mood enhancers that bring about wonderful feelings for them.\u201d She continued: \u201cWe came in for a medical procedure.\u201d\nMore than three decades later, she now says, \u201cI feel like I was raped 15 times.\u201d\nIn those same three decades, the mores around sex, assisted reproduction, and medical authority have changed, too. When the news about Cline came out, the medical community denounced his actions. \u201cIt was a breach of trust between a physician and his patient. One could say immoral,\u201d says Robert Colver, an Indiana fertility specialist who knew Cline. \u201cAll of us were shocked.\u201d\nWould it have been as shocking 30 years ago? In 1987, a national survey of fertility doctors found that 2 percent had used their own sperm in patients. On one hand, it was clearly not the norm. On the other, it couldn\u2019t have been so beyond the pale if it was presented as an option in a multiple-choice survey. The survey did not ask, however, whether the patients in those cases were aware that their doctor was also their sperm donor.\nI asked Colver, who has been practicing since the 1980s, how such a deception could even occur to a doctor. He had trouble answering, but he noted that procuring sperm was a much more tedious and time-sensitive process back then. Cline has said he inseminated within the hour to maximize a sample\u2019s viability. That would have meant coordinating the schedule of the sperm donor with the appointment of the ovulating patient several days a month, every month. Cline was a top fertility doctor in Indianapolis; he had a lot of patients.\nBased on the birth dates of his youngest known donor children, Cline stopped using his own sperm in the late 1980s, when sperm banks became more common. (The whole industry started relying on frozen sperm then, because doctors had discovered that HIV could be transmitted through fresh sperm.) When Cline later got into legal trouble, his friends and family members wrote letters to the judge about how difficult it must have been for him to disappoint patients when a donor couldn\u2019t be found. A friend whose wife was a patient of Cline\u2019s\u2014but did not have children through donor insemination\u2014wrote:\nDr. Cline\u2019s always put his patients first. Empathetic and full of compassion, he sought ways to help families through this most tender period when both husband and wife feel helpless \u2026 We can also empathize with the couple waiting expectantly because the time is right, and can understand the devastation that would wash upon them if there would be no viable sperm donor at that critical moment.\nIf his friends saw this as an exculpatory explanation, those angry with Cline saw something uglier. They saw not selflessness but selfishness. They saw a doctor who cared more about his professional success than his patients\u2019 well-being. They saw a man too comfortable in his power. If he truly believed he was doing nothing wrong, why did he deceive his patients?\nColver was more measured. He said he understood the reluctance to disappoint a patient. \u201cIs it sad that month to say, \u2018Unfortunately, Mrs. Jones, [the donor] couldn\u2019t come because of an emergency. So sorry, we\u2019re going to have to wait until next month\u2019?\u201d Of course it is. But consider the alternative: \u201cTo tell Mrs. Jones versus 30 years later having it come out like this. There\u2019s really no comparison between the two.\u201d\nLiz White carries around a photo of herself in 1982, beaming in a hospital bed with a baby boy in her arms. She named him Matthew, \u201cgift from God,\u201d because she thought of the sperm donation as a gift then. She is 30 in the photo. \u201cThat\u2019s how young I was,\u201d she told me, which I took to mean: I know you see an old woman now, but I was young and vulnerable and alone with the man.\nMatt figured it out before his mom did. After four of the half siblings filed their complaints with the Indiana attorney general, the Fox59 reporter, Angela Ganote, asked the local prosecutor about Cline. Her inquiry led to a criminal investigation. In September 2016, Ganote broke the news that Cline had been charged with two counts of felony obstruction of justice, and Matt\u2014along with the rest of the public\u2014learned what Cline had done.\nMatt already knew he was donor-conceived. Back in high-school biology class, he\u2019d realized that his blood type didn\u2019t match his parents\u2019. They sat him down and told him about the sperm donor, and no one really thought too hard about how Cline had promised that the donor\u2019s blood type would match Matt\u2019s father\u2019s. White remembers feeling bad for his dad then, but the revelation provoked no deep identity crisis. His mother would sometimes point out a building when they drove down 86th Street in Indianapolis: \u201cThat\u2019s where I got pregnant with you.\u201d She thought of it as a joyous place. After Matt saw Cline in the news, he looked up the address. It was Cline\u2019s old office. A DNA test confirmed what he already knew deep down. The resemblance between Matt and a young Cline is uncanny. They could be the same person.\nOver the next year, Matt and his newfound half siblings watched the criminal case against Cline unfold. He wasn\u2019t charged with rape. He wasn\u2019t charged with battery with bodily waste\u2014Indiana considers that a crime only if it\u2019s done \u201cin a rude, insolent, or angry manner.\u201d He wasn\u2019t charged with criminal deception\u2014any records were long gone. In fact, Cline wasn\u2019t charged for anything he did almost four decades ago. No law in Indiana\u2014or in most other states, for that matter\u2014specifically forbids a doctor from using his own sperm in his patients.\nCline violated the trust of his patients, but did he also wrong their children, who wouldn\u2019t exist if not for his deception?\nProsecutors charged Cline with two counts of obstruction of justice: He had received letters from the attorney general\u2019s office notifying him of the investigation, and had written back at least twice saying he\u2019d never used his own sperm and that any woman who said otherwise was \u201cguilty of slander and/or libel.\u201d This was easy to disprove. Investigators showed up at Cline\u2019s house with a search warrant for his DNA. They swabbed his mouth, and that was that.\nIn the 1980s, before anyone dreamed up mail-in DNA tests and internet genealogy sites, Cline must have thought no one would ever find out. As he faced the consequences now, he seemed to believe that he could make the whole mess go away by denying it with the full force of his being. Tim DeLaney, the prosecutor in this case, told me he saw the original wrong as a transgression by a person in power. When Cline was accused, DeLaney said, \u201che went to that same position of power and basically said, \u2018I\u2019m a doctor. These people are lying. They have defamed me.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t the reaction of a scared, powerless person. It was the reaction of a person used to being powerful.\u201d\nWhat particularly galled some of the siblings was how Cline used his faith as deflection. By all accounts, he is a very religious man\u2014for his sentencing, several elders from his evangelical church wrote letters attesting to his character. After the restaurant meeting, Cline called Ballard to say her digging up the past was destroying his marriage: His wife considered his actions adultery. In the call, which Ballard recorded, Cline told her he regretted what he\u2019d done\u2014though he admitted to using his own sperm only nine or 10 times\u2014and quoted Jeremiah 1:5, in which God lays out his plan for the prophet: \u201cBefore I formed you in your mother\u2019s womb, I knew you.\u201d Again, Ballard felt he was using her faith to try to manipulate her.\nCline was ultimately fined $500 and given a year of probation. He lost his medical license, but he\u2019d been retired since 2009. If he hadn\u2019t replied to the attorney general\u2019s letters\u2014which he had been under no obligation to do\u2014he might have gotten off entirely. (Several of the donor-conceived children and their mothers have also filed civil lawsuits against Cline.)\nDeLaney knows that some of the half siblings were angry that he only charged Cline with obstruction of justice, but he didn\u2019t think he could prove any other crime in court. He still thinks about the case often. \u201cIt\u2019s by far the most philosophically interesting of any case I ever had,\u201d he said. Cline violated the trust of his patients, but did he also wrong their children, who wouldn\u2019t exist if not for Cline\u2019s deception?\nFor Matt White, watching all this play out awoke a sense of purpose. He\u2019d dealt with infertility himself; his own two kids were conceived through sperm donation\u2014the modern version, with online catalogs and donors\u2019 baby photos. That gave him a sense of what his mother had gone through to have him. He understood why she felt violated.\nI met White, now 36, at a bakery in Indianapolis last November, the morning after the first storm of the season had shellacked the roads in ice. The day before, he and his mother and several of his half siblings had had a meeting with the president pro tempore of the Indiana Senate, Rodric Bray. The senator had introduced a fertility-fraud bill inspired by Cline\u2019s case the previous session, but it had died without a vote. Now the siblings were trying to revive the bill, which would make it illegal for doctors to use reproductive material improperly, and White had become the group\u2019s unofficial leader. It helped that his office was two blocks from the statehouse. He could pop over for meetings.\nWhite knows that many people may see Cline\u2019s case as a one-off, just the strange behavior of a lone doctor out in Indiana. But a handful of other doctors have also been accused of secretly using their own sperm\u2014in Connecticut, Virginia, Idaho, Vermont, and Canada. CeCe Moore, a genealogist who has helped adoptees and donor-conceived children find family, told me she\u2019s come across enough cases of fertility doctors using their own sperm that \u201cwhen I see these large groups of half siblings, it\u2019s actually the first thing I think about now.\u201d Many of the sibling groups have chosen to stay private, and their reactions run the gamut. Some siblings \u201cthink very highly of their donor father, his \u2018contributions\u2019 to their mothers,\u201d Moore said. \u201cSome are horrified by it.\u201d\nWhite was among those horrified, obviously. His mother contacted Jody Madeira, a law professor at Indiana University at Bloomington who has studied bioethics and reproductive medicine. Madeira took an interest in the case and helped write the fertility-fraud bill. \u201cWhen you talk to people about the Cline case, it\u2019s a physiological reaction of disgust, the sense that it\u2019s deeply, morally wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cIs it legally wrong? It should be.\u201d\nMany of the children Cline fathered still live in Indianapolis, and they find themselves accidentally running into his family. At the bakery where we met, White pointed straight ahead. Cline, he said, \u201clives down the street over there. I live down the street over there, and my mom lives in town here.\u201d Cline\u2019s daughter-in-law is an ob-gyn at the practice White\u2019s wife goes to. He thinks he saw Cline\u2019s daughter, a nurse who worked in Cline\u2019s practice, at Subway once. He got sick to his stomach and walked out. His mom saw the same daughter at a nail salon; she was getting a pedicure and couldn\u2019t get up to walk away.\nThe donor children have begun cataloging the ways their own paths have crossed, too. White went to Purdue at the same time as one of his half brothers. One sibling sold another a wagon at a garage sale. Two of them lived on the same street. Two had kids on the same softball team. They\u2019re worried that their children are getting old enough to date soon. \u201cDid you not consider we all live in a relatively close area?\u201d one sister said she has wondered about Cline. \u201cDid you really think \u2026 that we wouldn\u2019t meet? That we wouldn\u2019t maybe date? That we wouldn\u2019t have kids who might date? Did you never consider that?\u201d Cline now looms over their kids\u2019 every innocent crush, their every prom date.\nCline has admitted to using his own sperm about 50 times, which is about the number of children who have been identified through DNA. More may be out there, though\u2014DNA testing is common but nowhere near ubiquitous. During the time I corresponded with his donor children, every few weeks one of them would tell me that another sibling had been found. In the fall, they started sending letters to Indiana legislators urging them to support the fertility-fraud bill. (It was introduced in the general assembly, and seemed to be gaining momentum.) In early January, White texted me to say he had sealed a batch of letters to legislators the night before, only to find two more siblings. He was going to add a note on the envelopes.\nWhite\u2019s updates about new siblings always seemed to come with a mix of anger and sadness: anger at the growing scope of Cline\u2019s misdeeds, sadness for each additional family being turned upside down by a decades-old secret. But each new half sibling has dealt with the revelation in his or her own way.\nThe same Christmas Heather Woock got her DNA test, she\u2019d made her father a book tracing his genealogy, all the way up to Scottish royalty. Losing the genetic connection with her father meant losing the story she had literally written about who she was and how she came to be. It\u2019s this identity crisis\u2014more than Cline\u2019s inexplicable actions\u2014that she\u2019s still working through. The hardest part, she says, is \u201cprocessing that my parents outright lied to me throughout my childhood.\u201d\nKylene Gott, a 38-year-old teacher from Indianapolis, was in the car with her mom when she revealed that Cline was her biological father. Her mother\u2019s response: \u201cWell, good.\u201d Well, good? \u201cIf it was going to be anyone, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s him.\u201d Gott says her mom later talked about having seen pictures of Cline\u2019s kids on the wall and how pretty they were, and how intelligent. She had wanted kids like that. But her response upset Gott, who believed her origin story explained the dislocation she\u2019d felt her whole life in jobs and in social situations. \u201cI haven\u2019t really known who I am; that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t been able to figure out what I\u2019m supposed to do in the world,\u201d she says. She was thrilled to have new half siblings, and she dissected their lives for similarities, from favorite McDonald\u2019s orders to the bouquets in their wedding photos.\nAnother woman in Indianapolis, whom I\u2019ll call Amy, told me her mother was strangely calm when she heard about Cline. (Some of the donor children asked me not to use their real names, because they hadn\u2019t told everyone in their lives about their paternity.) Her mom\u2019s reaction was especially unnerving because Amy thought Cline was supposed to have used her father\u2019s sperm, not a donor\u2019s, and this deception struck her as even more grotesque. A few weeks after we spoke, Amy emailed to say we had to talk. She had confronted her mother, who revealed that she\u2019d always known it was a donor, if not Cline himself. When Amy was conceived, her parents had promised never to tell\u2014a promise her mom had kept even though Amy\u2019s father died years ago. Amy wishes she\u2019d never learned the truth. \u201cIgnorance is bliss,\u201d she told me, wistfully drawing out the last word.\nA man I\u2019ll call Tyler, who is a construction manager in Washington, D.C., told me that his mother, too, said she\u2019d thought Cline had used her husband\u2019s sperm. But, oddly, she didn\u2019t seem angry at Cline so much as angry at being found out. She made Tyler swear never to tell his dad. \u201cYou and I gotta take it to the grave,\u201d she said. Tyler now wonders whether she knew all along that the sperm came from a donor, even if she didn\u2019t know that donor was Cline. He still hasn\u2019t talked with his dad about it.\nJoseph (not his real name) has a twin brother, but they look nothing alike. \u201cI\u2019m taller than him. He outweighs me by 30 pounds,\u201d he says. They have different personalities, too. When Joseph took a DNA test in 2017 and discovered his paternity, he and his twin briefly wondered whether they had different fathers, because Cline had told their mother he\u2019d mixed a donor\u2019s sperm with her husband\u2019s. But no: They both had Cline\u2019s DNA. True to their different personalities, they reacted in opposite ways. Joseph has been very involved with the Facebook group, while his twin wants nothing to do with it. Strangest of all, Joseph met a half brother who looks exactly like him\u2014much more so than his actual twin.\nThey are just a few of the many people forging connections after the initial shock of a DNA surprise. Adoptees have reunited with their birth families. Donor-conceived children have found their biological fathers. And half siblings have met one another, creating new iterations of family entirely different from the traditional family unit their parents were seeking when they went to a fertility doctor.\nIn June of last year, on Father\u2019s Day weekend, the siblings gathered in Indiana for their second annual picnic. They\u2019d been getting together in smaller groups, for holidays, girls\u2019 nights, lunches, and meetings with state legislators. But this was the big shebang. Tyler flew in for the day from Washington. Spouses and children came too. Matt rented out a picnic pavilion, and brought name tags because many of the siblings were meeting for the first time. Their numbers had almost tripled since the previous year.\nEveryone pitched in a little. One sibling brought a birthday cake, which was becoming a tradition. Kylene brought chips and salsa. Amy made pasta salad. Heather thought to bring much-needed packs of bottled water. Matt brought chicken wings, and he sweated over the grill cooking them. It was a hot day. Their kids ran through sprinklers. They climbed trees and got sticky with sap. From afar, it must have looked like any family reunion.\nThis article appears in the April 2019 print edition with the headline \u201cThe Fertility Doctor\u2019s Secret.\u201d\n*This article has been updated to reflect the fact that, as of March 18, 2019, two more half siblings have been confirmed by DNA testing.",

For a while, Mitchell, an electrician in his 50s, stopped seeking dental care altogether. But when one of his wisdom teeth began to ache, he started looking for someone new. An acquaintance recommended John Roger Lund, whose practice was a convenient 10-minute walk from Mitchell&rsquo;s home, in San Jose, California. Lund&rsquo;s practice was situated in a one-story building with clay roof tiles that housed several dental offices. The interior was a little dated, but not dingy. The waiting room was small and the decor minimal: some plants and photos, no fish. Lund was a good-looking middle-aged guy with arched eyebrows, round glasses, and graying hair that framed a youthful face. He was charming, chatty, and upbeat. At the time, Mitchell and Lund both owned Chevrolet Chevelles, and they bonded over their mutual love of classic cars.</p>\n<p><i>To hear more feature stories, <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'586039'\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/audio-articles/?utm_source=audioarticleembed\">see our full list</a> or <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'586039'\" href=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=soundcloud&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=atlantic&utm_content=trouble_with_dentistry\">get the Audm iPhone app.</a> </i></p>\n<p>Lund extracted the wisdom tooth with no complications, and Mitchell began seeing him regularly. He never had any pain or new complaints, but Lund encouraged many additional treatments nonetheless. A typical person might get one or two root canals in a lifetime. In the space of seven years, Lund gave Mitchell nine root canals and just as many crowns. Mitchell&rsquo;s insurance covered only a small portion of each procedure, so he paid a total of about $50,000 out of pocket. The number and cost of the treatments did not trouble him. He had no idea that it was <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'586039'\" href=\"https://www.aae.org/patients/root-canal-treatment/what-is-a-root-canal/root-canal-explained/\">unusual to undergo so many root canals</a>&mdash;he thought they were just as common as fillings. The payments were spread out over a relatively long period of time. And he trusted Lund completely. He figured that if he needed the treatments, then he might as well get them before things grew worse.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, another of Lund&rsquo;s patients was going through a similar experience. Joyce Cordi, a businesswoman in her 50s, had learned of Lund through 1-800-DENTIST. She remembers the service giving him an excellent rating. When she visited Lund for the first time, in 1999, she had never had so much as a cavity. To the best of her knowledge her teeth were perfectly healthy, although she&rsquo;d had a small dental bridge installed to fix a rare congenital anomaly (she was born with one tooth trapped inside another and had had them extracted). Within a year, Lund was questioning the resilience of her bridge and telling her she needed root canals and crowns.</p>\n<p>Cordi was somewhat perplexed. Why the sudden need for so many procedures after decades of good dental health? When she expressed uncertainty, she says, Lund always had an answer ready. The cavity on this tooth was in the wrong position to treat with a typical filling, he told her on one occasion. Her gums were receding, which had resulted in tooth decay, he explained during another visit. Clearly she had been grinding her teeth. And, after all, she was getting older. As a doctor&rsquo;s daughter, Cordi had been raised with an especially respectful view of medical professionals. Lund was insistent, so she agreed to the procedures. Over the course of a decade, Lund gave Cordi 10 root canals and 10 crowns. He also chiseled out her bridge, replacing it with two new ones that left a conspicuous gap in her front teeth. Altogether, the work cost her about $70,000.</p>\n<aside>A masked figure looms over your recumbent body, wielding power tools and sharp metal instruments, doing things to your mouth you cannot see.</aside>\n<p>In early 2012, Lund retired. Brendon Zeidler, a young dentist looking to expand his business, bought Lund&rsquo;s practice and assumed responsibility for his patients. Within a few months, Zeidler began to suspect that something was amiss. Financial records indicated that Lund had been spectacularly successful, but Zeidler was making only 10 to 25 percent of Lund&rsquo;s reported earnings each month. As Zeidler met more of Lund&rsquo;s former patients, he noticed a disquieting trend: Many of them had undergone extensive dental work&mdash;a much larger proportion than he would have expected. When Zeidler told them, after routine exams or cleanings, that they didn&rsquo;t need any additional procedures at that time, they tended to react with surprise and concern: Was he sure? Nothing at all? Had he checked thoroughly?</p>\n<p>In the summer, Zeidler decided to take a closer look at Lund&rsquo;s career. He gathered years&rsquo; worth of dental records and bills for Lund&rsquo;s patients and began to scrutinize them, one by one. The process took him months to complete. What he uncovered was appalling.</p>\n<p>We have a fraught relationship with dentists as authority figures. In casual conversation we often dismiss them as &ldquo;not real doctors,&rdquo; regarding them more as mechanics for the mouth. But that disdain is tempered by fear. For more than a century, dentistry has been half-jokingly compared to torture. Surveys suggest that up to 61 percent of people are apprehensive about seeing the dentist, perhaps 15 percent are so anxious that they avoid the dentist almost entirely, and a smaller percentage have <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'586039'\" href=\"https://metdental.ecepartners.com/courses/1828%2FPDF%2FMngmnt_of_the_Anxious_Fearful_Phobic_Dntl_Ptnt.pdf\">a genuine phobia</a> requiring psychiatric intervention.</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re in the dentist&rsquo;s chair, the power imbalance between practitioner and patient becomes palpable. A masked figure looms over your recumbent body, wielding power tools and sharp metal instruments, doing things to your mouth you cannot see, asking you questions you cannot properly answer, and judging you all the while. The experience simultaneously invokes physical danger, emotional vulnerability, and mental limpness. A cavity or receding gum line can suddenly feel like a personal failure. When a dentist declares that there is a problem, that something must be done before it&rsquo;s too late, who has the courage or expertise to disagree? When he points at spectral smudges on an X-ray, how are we to know what&rsquo;s true? In other medical contexts, such as a visit to a general practitioner or a cardiologist, we are fairly accustomed to seeking a second opinion before agreeing to surgery or an expensive regimen of pills with harsh side effects. But in the dentist&rsquo;s office&mdash;perhaps because we both dread dental procedures and belittle their medical significance&mdash;the impulse is to comply without much consideration, to get the whole thing over with as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>The uneasy relationship between dentist and patient is further complicated by an unfortunate reality: Common dental procedures are not always as safe, effective, or durable as we are meant to believe. As a profession, dentistry has not yet applied the same level of self-scrutiny as medicine, or embraced as sweeping an emphasis on scientific evidence. &ldquo;We are isolated from the larger health-care system. So when evidence-based policies are being made, dentistry is often left out of the equation,&rdquo; says Jane Gillette, a dentist in Bozeman, Montana, who works closely with the <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'586039'\" href=\"https://www.ada.org/en/about-the-ada/ada-positions-policies-and-statements/policy-on-evidence-based-dentistry\">American Dental Association&rsquo;s Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry</a>, which was established in 2007. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re kind of behind the times, but increasingly we are trying to move the needle forward.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Consider the maxim that everyone should visit the dentist twice a year for cleanings. We hear it so often, and from such a young age, that we&rsquo;ve internalized it as truth. But this supposed commandment of oral health has no scientific grounding. Scholars have traced its origins to a few potential sources, including a toothpaste advertisement from the 1930s and an illustrated pamphlet from 1849 that follows the travails of a man with a severe toothache. Today, an increasing number of dentists acknowledge that adults with good oral hygiene need to see a dentist only once every 12 to 16 months.</p>\n<p>Many standard dental treatments&mdash;to say nothing of all the recent innovations and cosmetic extravagances&mdash;are likewise not well substantiated by research. Many have never been tested in meticulous clinical trials. And the data that are available are not always reassuring.</p>\n<p><a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'586039'\" href=\"https://oralhealth.cochrane.org/oral-health-evidence\">The Cochrane organization</a>, a highly respected arbiter of evidence-based medicine, has conducted systematic reviews of oral-health studies since 1999. In these reviews, researchers analyze the scientific literature on a particular dental intervention, focusing on the most rigorous and well-designed studies. In some cases, the findings clearly justify a given procedure. For example, dental sealants&mdash;liquid plastics painted onto the pits and grooves of teeth like nail polish&mdash;reduce tooth decay in children and have no known risks. (Despite this, they are not widely used, possibly because they are too simple and inexpensive to earn dentists much money.) But most of the Cochrane reviews reach one of two disheartening conclusions: Either the available evidence fails to confirm the purported benefits of a given dental intervention, or there is simply not enough research to say anything substantive one way or another.</p>\n<p>Fluoridation of drinking water seems to help reduce tooth decay in children, but there is insufficient evidence that it does the same for adults. Some data suggest that regular flossing, in addition to brushing, mitigates gum disease, but there is only &ldquo;weak, very unreliable&rdquo; evidence that it combats plaque. As for common but invasive dental procedures, an increasing number of dentists question the tradition of prophylactic wisdom-teeth removal; often, the safer choice is to monitor unproblematic teeth for any worrying developments. Little medical evidence justifies the substitution of tooth-colored resins for typical metal amalgams to fill cavities. And what limited data we have don&rsquo;t clearly indicate whether it&rsquo;s better to repair a root-canaled tooth with a crown or a filling. When Cochrane researchers tried to determine whether faulty metal fillings should be repaired or replaced, they could not find a single study that met their standards.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The body of evidence for dentistry is disappointing,&rdquo; says <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'586039'\" href=\"https://dentistry.dundee.ac.uk/staff-member/mr-derek-richards\">Derek Richards</a>, the director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Dentistry at the University of Dundee, in Scotland. &ldquo;Dentists tend to want to treat or intervene. They are more akin to surgeons than they are to physicians. We suffer a little from that. Everybody keeps fiddling with stuff, trying out the newest thing, but they don&rsquo;t test them properly in a good-quality trial.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The general dearth of rigorous research on dental interventions gives dentists even more leverage over their patients. Should a patient somehow muster the gumption to question an initial diagnosis and consult the scientific literature, she would probably not find much to help her. When we submit to a dentist&rsquo;s examination, we are putting a great deal of trust in that dentist&rsquo;s experience and intuition&mdash;and, of course, integrity.</p>\n<p>When Zeidler purchased Lund&rsquo;spractice, in February 2012, he inherited a massive collection of patients&rsquo; dental histories and bills, a mix of electronic documents, handwritten charts, and X\u2011rays. By August, Zeidler had decided that if anything could explain the alarmingly abundant dental work in the mouths of Lund&rsquo;s patients, he would find it in those records. He spent every weekend for the next nine months examining the charts of hundreds of patients treated in the preceding five years. In a giant Excel spreadsheet, he logged every single procedure Lund had performed, so he could carry out some basic statistical analyses.</p>\n<p>The numbers spoke for themselves. Year after year, Lund had performed certain procedures at extraordinarily high rates. Whereas a typical dentist might perform root canals on previously crowned teeth in only 3 to 7 percent of cases, Lund was performing them in 90 percent of cases. As Zeidler later alleged in court documents, Lund had performed invasive, costly, and seemingly unnecessary procedures on dozens and dozens of patients, some of whom he had been seeing for decades. Terry Mitchell and Joyce Cordi were far from alone. In fact, they had not even endured the worst of it.</p>\n<aside>Whereas medicine has reckoned with some of its own tendencies toward excessive and misguided treatment, dentistry has lagged behind.</aside>\n<p>Dental crowns were one of Lund&rsquo;s most frequent treatments. A crown is a metal or ceramic cap that completely encases an injured or decayed tooth, which is first shaved to a peg so its new shell will fit. <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'586039'\" href=\"https://www.aspendental.com/dental-services/dental-crowns\">Crowns</a> typically last 10 to 15 years. Lund not only gave his patients superfluous crowns; he also tended to replace them every five years&mdash;the minimum interval of time before insurance companies will cover the procedure again.</p>\n<p>More than 50 of Lund&rsquo;s patients also had ludicrously high numbers of root canals: 15, 20, 24. (A typical adult mouth has 32 teeth.) According to one lawsuit that has since been settled, a woman in her late 50s came to Lund with only 10 natural teeth; from 2003 to 2010, he gave her nine root canals and 12 crowns. The American Association of Endodontists claims that a root canal is a &ldquo;quick, comfortable procedure&rdquo; that is &ldquo;very similar to a routine filling.&rdquo; In truth, a root canal is a much more radical operation than a filling. It takes longer, can cause significant discomfort, and may require multiple trips to a dentist or specialist. It&rsquo;s also much more costly.</p>\n<p>Root canals are typically used to treat infections of the pulp&mdash;the soft living core of a tooth. A dentist drills a hole through a tooth in order to access the root canals: long, narrow channels containing nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue. The dentist then repeatedly twists skinny metal files in and out of the canals to scrape away all the living tissue, irrigates the canals with disinfectant, and packs them with a rubberlike material. The whole process usually takes one to two hours. Afterward, sometimes at a second visit, the dentist will strengthen the tooth with a filling or crown. In the rare case that infection returns, the patient must go through the whole ordeal again or consider more advanced surgery.</p>\n<p>Zeidler noticed that nearly every time Lund gave someone a root canal, he also charged for an incision and drainage, known as an I&amp;D. During an I&amp;D, a dentist lances an abscess in the mouth and drains the exudate, all while the patient is awake. In some cases the dentist slips a small rubber tube into the wound, which continues to drain fluids and remains in place for a few days. I&amp;Ds are not routine adjuncts to root canals. They should be used only to treat severe infections, which occur in a minority of cases. Yet they were extremely common in Lund&rsquo;s practice. In 2009, for example, Lund billed his patients for 109 I&amp;Ds. Zeidler asked many of those patients about the treatments, but none of them recalled what would almost certainly have been a memorable experience.</p>\n<p>In addition to performing scores of seemingly unnecessary procedures that could result in chronic pain, medical complications, and further operations, Lund had apparently billed patients for treatments he had never administered. Zeidler was alarmed and distressed. &ldquo;We go into this profession to care for patients,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;That is why we become doctors. To find, I felt, someone was doing the exact opposite of that&mdash;it was very hard, very hard to accept that someone was willing to do that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Zeidler knew what he had to do next. As a dental professional, he had certain ethical obligations. He needed to confront Lund directly and give him the chance to account for all the anomalies. Even more daunting, in the absence of a credible explanation, he would have to divulge his discoveries to the patients Lund had bequeathed to him. He would have to tell them that the man to whom they had entrusted their care&mdash;some of them for two decades&mdash;had apparently deceived them for his own profit.</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/WEL_Jabr_DentistsSpot1/1ae18c251.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/WEL_Jabr_DentistsSpot1/1ae18c251.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/WEL_Jabr_DentistsSpot1/1ae18c251.jpg\"></img></picture><figcaption>Arsh Raziuddin</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The idea of the dentist as potential charlatan has a long and rich history. In medieval Europe, barbers didn&rsquo;t just trim hair and shave beards; they were also surgeons, performing a range of minor operations including bloodletting, the administration of enemas, and tooth extraction. <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'586039'\" href=\"http://broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/barbersurgeons\">Barber surgeons</a>, and the more specialized &ldquo;tooth drawers,&rdquo; would wrench, smash, and knock teeth out of people&rsquo;s mouths with an intimidating metal instrument called a <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'586039'\" href=\"https://georgianera.wordpress.com/2015/02/05/18th-century-dentistry/\">dental key</a>: Imagine a chimera of a hook, a hammer, and forceps. Sometimes the results were disastrous. In the 1700s, Thomas Berdmore, King George III&rsquo;s &ldquo;Operator for the Teeth,&rdquo; <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'586039'\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2taAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=thomas+berdmore+walnut+jawbone&source=bl&ots=mQHKLFfZWN&sig=okZy8Dx6SYw7CJm9cDOGEabcyq8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjeg_es8p7aAhVIsVQKHQUED7EQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q=thomas%20berdmore%20walnut%20j&f=false\">described one woman</a> who lost &ldquo;a piece of jawbone as big as a walnut and three neighbouring molars&rdquo; at the hands of a local barber.</p>\n<p>Barber surgeons came to America as early as 1636. By the 18th century, dentistry was firmly established in the colonies as a trade akin to blacksmithing (<a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'586039'\" href=\"https://www.ada.org/~/media/ADA/Education%20and%20Careers/Files/faq_dentistry.pdf?la=en\">Paul Revere</a> was an early American craftsman of artisanal dentures). Itinerant dentists moved from town to town by carriage with carts of dreaded tools in tow, temporarily setting up shop in a tavern or town square. They yanked teeth or bored into them with hand drills, filling cavities with mercury, tin, gold, or molten lead. For anesthetic, they used arsenic, nutgalls, mustard seed, leeches. Mixed in with the honest tradesmen&mdash;who genuinely believed in the therapeutic power of bloodsucking worms&mdash;were swindlers who urged their customers to have numerous teeth removed in a single sitting or charged them extra to stuff their pitted molars with homemade gunk of dubious benefit.</p>\n<p>In the mid-19th century, a pair of American dentists began to elevate their trade to the level of a profession. From 1839 to 1840, <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'586039'\" href=\"https://www.fauchard.org/publications/12-dr-chapin-a-harris\">Horace Hayden and Chapin Harris</a> established dentistry&rsquo;s first college, scientific journal, and national association. Some historical accounts claim that Hayden and Harris approached the University of Maryland&rsquo;s School of Medicine about adding dental instruction to the curriculum, only to be rebuffed by the resident physicians, who declared that dentistry was of little consequence. But no definitive proof of this encounter has ever surfaced.</p>\n<p>Whatever happened, from that point on, &ldquo;the professions of dentistry and medicine would develop along separate paths,&rdquo; writes Mary Otto, a health journalist, in her recent book, <i>Teeth</i>. Becoming a practicing physician requires four years of medical school followed by a three-to-seven-year residency program, depending on the specialty. Dentists earn a degree in four years and, in most states, can immediately take the national board exams, get a license, and begin treating patients. (Some choose to continue training in a specialty, such as orthodontics or oral and maxillofacial surgery.) When physicians complete their residency, they typically work for a hospital, university, or large health-care organization with substantial oversight, strict ethical codes, and standardized treatment regimens. By contrast, about 80 percent of the nation&rsquo;s 200,000 active dentists have individual practices, and although they are bound by a code of ethics, they typically don&rsquo;t have the same level of oversight.</p>\n<p>Throughout history, many physicians have lamented the segregation of dentistry and medicine. Acting as though oral health is somehow divorced from one&rsquo;s overall well-being is absurd; the two are inextricably linked. Oral bacteria and the toxins they produce can migrate through the bloodstream and airways, potentially damaging the heart and lungs. Poor oral health is associated with narrowing arteries, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and respiratory disease, possibly due to a complex interplay of oral microbes and the immune system. And some research suggests that gum disease can be an early sign of diabetes, indicating a relationship between sugar, oral bacteria, and chronic inflammation.</p>\n<p>Dentistry&rsquo;s academic and professional isolation has been especially detrimental to its own scientific inquiry. Most major medical associations around the world have long endorsed evidence-based medicine. The idea is to shift focus away from intuition, anecdote, and received wisdom, and toward the conclusions of rigorous clinical research. Although the phrase <i>evidence-based medicine</i> was coined in 1991, the concept began taking shape in the 1960s, if not earlier (some scholars trace its origins all the way back to the 17th century). In contrast, the dental community did not begin having similar conversations until the mid-1990s. There are dozens of journals and organizations devoted to evidence-based medicine, but only a handful devoted to evidence-based dentistry.</p>\n<p>In the past decade, a small cohort of dentists has worked diligently to promote evidence-based dentistry, hosting workshops, publishing clinical-practice guidelines based on systematic reviews of research, and creating websites that curate useful resources. But its adoption &ldquo;has been a relatively slow process,&rdquo; as a <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'15',r'586039'\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5004537/\">2016 commentary</a> in the <i>Contemporary Clinical Dentistry </i>journal put it. Part of the problem is funding: Because dentistry is often sidelined from medicine at large, it simply does not receive as much money from the government and industry to tackle these issues. &ldquo;At a recent conference, very few practitioners were even aware of the existence of evidence-based clinical guidelines,&rdquo; says Elliot Abt, a professor of oral medicine at the University of Illinois. &ldquo;You can publish a guideline in a journal, but passive dissemination of information is clearly not adequate for real change.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Among other problems, dentistry&rsquo;s struggle to embrace scientific inquiry has left dentists with considerable latitude to advise unnecessary procedures&mdash;whether intentionally or not. The standard euphemism for this proclivity is <i>overtreatment</i>. Favored procedures, many of which are elaborate and steeply priced, include root canals, the application of crowns and veneers, teeth whitening and filing, deep cleaning, gum grafts, fillings for &ldquo;microcavities&rdquo;&mdash;incipient lesions that do not require immediate treatment&mdash;and superfluous restorations and replacements, such as swapping old metal fillings for modern resin ones. Whereas medicine has made progress in reckoning with at least some of its own tendencies toward excessive and misguided treatment, dentistry is lagging behind. It remains &ldquo;largely focused upon surgical procedures to treat the symptoms of disease,&rdquo; Mary Otto writes. &ldquo;America&rsquo;s dental care system continues to reward those surgical procedures far more than it does prevention.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Excessive diagnosis and treatment are endemic,&rdquo; says Jeffrey H. Camm, a dentist of more than 35 years who wryly described his peers&rsquo; penchant for &ldquo;<a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'16',r'586039'\" href=\"https://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/viewpoint/my-view/2013/october/creative-diagnosis\">creative diagnosis</a>&rdquo; in a 2013 commentary published by the American Dental Association. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be damning. I think the majority of dentists are pretty good.&rdquo; But many have &ldquo;this attitude of &lsquo;Oh, here&rsquo;s a spot, I&rsquo;ve got to do something.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been contacted by all kinds of practitioners who are upset because patients come in and they already have three crowns, or 12 fillings, or another dentist told them that their 2-year-old child has several cavities and needs to be sedated for the procedure.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trish Walraven, who worked as a dental hygienist for 25 years and now manages a dental-software company with her husband in Texas, recalls many troubling cases: &ldquo;We would see patients seeking a second opinion, and they had treatment plans telling them they need eight fillings in virgin teeth. We would look at X-rays and say, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me.&rsquo; It was blatantly overtreatment&mdash;drilling into teeth that did not need it whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside>Joyce Cordi&rsquo;s new dentist says her X-rays resemble those of someone who had reconstructive facial surgery following a car crash.</aside>\n<p>Studies that explicitly focus on overtreatment in dentistry are rare, but a recent field experiment provides some clues about its pervasiveness. A team of researchers at ETH Zurich, a Swiss university, asked a volunteer patient with three tiny, shallow cavities to visit 180 randomly selected dentists in Zurich. The Swiss Dental Guidelines state that such minor cavities do not require fillings; rather, the dentist should monitor the decay and encourage the patient to brush regularly, which can reverse the damage. Despite this, 50 of the 180 dentists suggested unnecessary treatment. Their recommendations were incongruous: Collectively, the overzealous dentists singled out 13 different teeth for drilling; each advised one to six fillings. Similarly, <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'17',r'586039'\" href=\"https://www.dentistat.com/ReaderDigestArticle.pdf\">in an investigation for <i>Reader&rsquo;s Digest</i></a>, the writer William Ecenbarger visited 50 dentists in 28 states in the U.S. and received prescriptions ranging from a single crown to a full-mouth reconstruction, with the price tag starting at about $500 and going up to nearly $30,000.</p>\n<p>A multitude of factors has conspired to create both the opportunity and the motive for widespread overtreatment in dentistry. In addition to dentistry&rsquo;s seclusion from the greater medical community, its traditional emphasis on procedure rather than prevention, and its lack of rigorous self-evaluation, there are economic explanations. The financial burden of entering the profession is high and rising. In the U.S., the average debt of a dental-school graduate is more than $200,000. And then there&rsquo;s the expense of finding an office, buying new equipment, and hiring staff to set up a private practice. A dentist&rsquo;s income is entirely dependent on the number and type of procedures he or she performs; a routine cleaning and examination earns only a baseline fee of about $200.</p>\n<p>In parallel with the rising cost of dental school, the amount of tooth decay in many countries&rsquo; populations has declined dramatically over the past four decades, mostly thanks to the introduction of mass-produced fluoridated toothpaste in the 1950s and &rsquo;60s. In the 1980s, with fewer genuine problems to treat, some practitioners turned to the newly flourishing industry of cosmetic dentistry, promoting elective procedures such as bleaching, teeth filing and straightening, gum lifts, and veneers. It&rsquo;s easy to see how dentists, hoping to buoy their income, would be tempted to recommend frequent exams and proactive treatments&mdash;a small filling here, a new crown there&mdash;even when waiting and watching would be better. It&rsquo;s equally easy to imagine how that behavior might escalate.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If I were to sum it up, I really think the majority of dentists are great. But for some reason we seem to drift toward this attitude of &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got tools so I&rsquo;ve got to fix something&rsquo; much too often,&rdquo; says Jeffrey Camm. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s greed, or paying off debt, or maybe it&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s training. It&rsquo;s easy to lose sight of the fact that even something that seems minor, like a filling, involves removal of a human body part. It just adds to the whole idea that you go to a physician feeling bad and you walk out feeling better, but you go to a dentist feeling good and you walk out feeling bad.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/WEL_Jabr_DentistsSpot2/7884554f6.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/WEL_Jabr_DentistsSpot2/7884554f6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/WEL_Jabr_DentistsSpot2/7884554f6.jpg\"></img></picture><figcaption>Arsh Raziuddin</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the summer of 2013, Zeidlerasked several other dentists to review Lund&rsquo;s records. They all agreed with his conclusions. The likelihood that Lund&rsquo;s patients genuinely needed that many treatments was extremely low. And there was no medical evidence to justify many of Lund&rsquo;s decisions or to explain the phantom procedures. Zeidler confronted Lund about his discoveries in several face-to-face meetings. When I asked Zeidler how those meetings went, he offered a single sentence&mdash;&ldquo;I decided shortly thereafter to take legal action&rdquo;&mdash;and declined to comment further. (Repeated attempts were made to contact Lund and his lawyer for this story, but neither responded.)</p>\n<p>One by one, Zeidler began to write, call, or sit down with patients who had previously been in Lund&rsquo;s care, explaining what he had uncovered. They were shocked and angry. Lund had been charismatic and professional. They had assumed that his diagnoses and treatments were meant to keep them healthy. Isn&rsquo;t that what doctors do? &ldquo;It makes you feel like you have been violated,&rdquo; Terry Mitchell says&mdash;&ldquo;somebody performing stuff on your body that doesn&rsquo;t need to be done.&rdquo; Joyce Cordi recalls a &ldquo;moment of absolute fury&rdquo; when she first learned of Lund&rsquo;s deceit. On top of all the needless operations, &ldquo;there were all kinds of drains and things that I paid for and the insurance company paid for that never happened,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t read the dentalese.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of them felt, <i>How can I be so stupid?</i> Or <i>Why didn&rsquo;t I go elsewhere?</i>&rdquo; Zeidler says. &ldquo;But this is not about intellect. It&rsquo;s about betrayal of trust.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In October 2013, Zeidler sued Lund for misrepresenting his practice and breaching their contract. In the lawsuit, Zeidler and his lawyers argued that Lund&rsquo;s reported practice income of $729,000 to $988,000 a year was &ldquo;a result of fraudulent billing activity, billing for treatment that was unnecessary and billing for treatment which was never performed.&rdquo; The suit was settled for a confidential amount. From 2014 to 2017, 10 of Lund&rsquo;s former patients, including Mitchell and Cordi, sued him for a mix of fraud, deceit, battery, financial elder abuse, and dental malpractice. They collectively reached a nearly $3 million settlement, paid out by Lund&rsquo;s insurance company. (Lund did not admit to any wrongdoing.)</p>\n<p>Lund was arrested in May 2016 and released on $250,000 bail. The Santa Clara County district attorney&rsquo;s office is <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'18',r'586039'\" href=\"https://www.sccgov.org/sites/da/newsroom/newsreleases/Pages/NRA2016/Dental-Fraud---Soares.aspx\">prosecuting a criminal case against him</a> based on 26 counts of insurance fraud. At the time of his arraignment, he said he was innocent of all charges. The Dental Board of California is seeking to revoke or suspend Lund&rsquo;s license, which is currently inactive.</p>\n<p>Many of Lund&rsquo;s former patients worry about their future health. A root canal is not a permanent fix. It requires maintenance and, in the long run, may need to be replaced with a dental implant. One of Mitchell&rsquo;s root canals has already failed: The tooth fractured, and an infection developed. He said that in order to treat the infection, the tooth was extracted and he underwent a multistage procedure involving a bone graft and months of healing before an implant and a crown were fixed in place. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much these root canals are going to cost me down the line,&rdquo; Mitchell says. &ldquo;Six thousand dollars a pop for an implant&mdash;it adds up pretty quick.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Joyce Cordi&rsquo;s new dentist says her X\u2011rays resemble those of someone who had reconstructive facial surgery following a car crash. Because Lund installed her new dental bridges improperly, one of her teeth is continually damaged by everyday chewing. &ldquo;It hurts like hell,&rdquo; she says. She has to wear a mouth guard every night.</p>\n<p>What some of Lund&rsquo;s former patients regret most are the psychological repercussions of his alleged duplicity: the erosion of the covenant between practitioner and patient, the germ of doubt that infects the mind. &ldquo;You lose your trust,&rdquo; Mitchell says. &ldquo;You become cynical. I have become more that way, and I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He damaged the trust I need to have in the people who take care of me,&rdquo; Cordi says. &ldquo;He damaged my trust in mankind. That&rsquo;s an unforgivable crime.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>This article appears in the May 2019 print edition with the headline &ldquo;The Trouble With Dentistry.&rdquo;</em></p>",

                "text": "In the early 2000s Terry Mitchell\u2019s dentist retired. For a while, Mitchell, an electrician in his 50s, stopped seeking dental care altogether. But when one of his wisdom teeth began to ache, he started looking for someone new. An acquaintance recommended John Roger Lund, whose practice was a convenient 10-minute walk from Mitchell\u2019s home, in San Jose, California. Lund\u2019s practice was situated in a one-story building with clay roof tiles that housed several dental offices. The interior was a little dated, but not dingy. The waiting room was small and the decor minimal: some plants and photos, no fish. Lund was a good-looking middle-aged guy with arched eyebrows, round glasses, and graying hair that framed a youthful face. He was charming, chatty, and upbeat. At the time, Mitchell and Lund both owned Chevrolet Chevelles, and they bonded over their mutual love of classic cars.\nTo hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app.\nLund extracted the wisdom tooth with no complications, and Mitchell began seeing him regularly. He never had any pain or new complaints, but Lund encouraged many additional treatments nonetheless. A typical person might get one or two root canals in a lifetime. In the space of seven years, Lund gave Mitchell nine root canals and just as many crowns. Mitchell\u2019s insurance covered only a small portion of each procedure, so he paid a total of about $50,000 out of pocket. The number and cost of the treatments did not trouble him. He had no idea that it was unusual to undergo so many root canals\u2014he thought they were just as common as fillings. The payments were spread out over a relatively long period of time. And he trusted Lund completely. He figured that if he needed the treatments, then he might as well get them before things grew worse.\nMeanwhile, another of Lund\u2019s patients was going through a similar experience. Joyce Cordi, a businesswoman in her 50s, had learned of Lund through 1-800-DENTIST. She remembers the service giving him an excellent rating. When she visited Lund for the first time, in 1999, she had never had so much as a cavity. To the best of her knowledge her teeth were perfectly healthy, although she\u2019d had a small dental bridge installed to fix a rare congenital anomaly (she was born with one tooth trapped inside another and had had them extracted). Within a year, Lund was questioning the resilience of her bridge and telling her she needed root canals and crowns.\nCordi was somewhat perplexed. Why the sudden need for so many procedures after decades of good dental health? When she expressed uncertainty, she says, Lund always had an answer ready. The cavity on this tooth was in the wrong position to treat with a typical filling, he told her on one occasion. Her gums were receding, which had resulted in tooth decay, he explained during another visit. Clearly she had been grinding her teeth. And, after all, she was getting older. As a doctor\u2019s daughter, Cordi had been raised with an especially respectful view of medical professionals. Lund was insistent, so she agreed to the procedures. Over the course of a decade, Lund gave Cordi 10 root canals and 10 crowns. He also chiseled out her bridge, replacing it with two new ones that left a conspicuous gap in her front teeth. Altogether, the work cost her about $70,000.\nA masked figure looms over your recumbent body, wielding power tools and sharp metal instruments, doing things to your mouth you cannot see.\nIn early 2012, Lund retired. Brendon Zeidler, a young dentist looking to expand his business, bought Lund\u2019s practice and assumed responsibility for his patients. Within a few months, Zeidler began to suspect that something was amiss. Financial records indicated that Lund had been spectacularly successful, but Zeidler was making only 10 to 25 percent of Lund\u2019s reported earnings each month. As Zeidler met more of Lund\u2019s former patients, he noticed a disquieting trend: Many of them had undergone extensive dental work\u2014a much larger proportion than he would have expected. When Zeidler told them, after routine exams or cleanings, that they didn\u2019t need any additional procedures at that time, they tended to react with surprise and concern: Was he sure? Nothing at all? Had he checked thoroughly?\nIn the summer, Zeidler decided to take a closer look at Lund\u2019s career. He gathered years\u2019 worth of dental records and bills for Lund\u2019s patients and began to scrutinize them, one by one. The process took him months to complete. What he uncovered was appalling.\nWe have a fraught relationship with dentists as authority figures. In casual conversation we often dismiss them as \u201cnot real doctors,\u201d regarding them more as mechanics for the mouth. But that disdain is tempered by fear. For more than a century, dentistry has been half-jokingly compared to torture. Surveys suggest that up to 61 percent of people are apprehensive about seeing the dentist, perhaps 15 percent are so anxious that they avoid the dentist almost entirely, and a smaller percentage have a genuine phobia requiring psychiatric intervention.\nWhen you\u2019re in the dentist\u2019s chair, the power imbalance between practitioner and patient becomes palpable. A masked figure looms over your recumbent body, wielding power tools and sharp metal instruments, doing things to your mouth you cannot see, asking you questions you cannot properly answer, and judging you all the while. The experience simultaneously invokes physical danger, emotional vulnerability, and mental limpness. A cavity or receding gum line can suddenly feel like a personal failure. When a dentist declares that there is a problem, that something must be done before it\u2019s too late, who has the courage or expertise to disagree? When he points at spectral smudges on an X-ray, how are we to know what\u2019s true? In other medical contexts, such as a visit to a general practitioner or a cardiologist, we are fairly accustomed to seeking a second opinion before agreeing to surgery or an expensive regimen of pills with harsh side effects. But in the dentist\u2019s office\u2014perhaps because we both dread dental procedures and belittle their medical significance\u2014the impulse is to comply without much consideration, to get the whole thing over with as quickly as possible.\nThe uneasy relationship between dentist and patient is further complicated by an unfortunate reality: Common dental procedures are not always as safe, effective, or durable as we are meant to believe. As a profession, dentistry has not yet applied the same level of self-scrutiny as medicine, or embraced as sweeping an emphasis on scientific evidence. \u201cWe are isolated from the larger health-care system. So when evidence-based policies are being made, dentistry is often left out of the equation,\u201d says Jane Gillette, a dentist in Bozeman, Montana, who works closely with the American Dental Association\u2019s Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry, which was established in 2007. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of behind the times, but increasingly we are trying to move the needle forward.\u201d\nConsider the maxim that everyone should visit the dentist twice a year for cleanings. We hear it so often, and from such a young age, that we\u2019ve internalized it as truth. But this supposed commandment of oral health has no scientific grounding. Scholars have traced its origins to a few potential sources, including a toothpaste advertisement from the 1930s and an illustrated pamphlet from 1849 that follows the travails of a man with a severe toothache. Today, an increasing number of dentists acknowledge that adults with good oral hygiene need to see a dentist only once every 12 to 16 months.\nMany standard dental treatments\u2014to say nothing of all the recent innovations and cosmetic extravagances\u2014are likewise not well substantiated by research. Many have never been tested in meticulous clinical trials. And the data that are available are not always reassuring.\nThe Cochrane organization, a highly respected arbiter of evidence-based medicine, has conducted systematic reviews of oral-health studies since 1999. In these reviews, researchers analyze the scientific literature on a particular dental intervention, focusing on the most rigorous and well-designed studies. In some cases, the findings clearly justify a given procedure. For example, dental sealants\u2014liquid plastics painted onto the pits and grooves of teeth like nail polish\u2014reduce tooth decay in children and have no known risks. (Despite this, they are not widely used, possibly because they are too simple and inexpensive to earn dentists much money.) But most of the Cochrane reviews reach one of two disheartening conclusions: Either the available evidence fails to confirm the purported benefits of a given dental intervention, or there is simply not enough research to say anything substantive one way or another.\nFluoridation of drinking water seems to help reduce tooth decay in children, but there is insufficient evidence that it does the same for adults. Some data suggest that regular flossing, in addition to brushing, mitigates gum disease, but there is only \u201cweak, very unreliable\u201d evidence that it combats plaque. As for common but invasive dental procedures, an increasing number of dentists question the tradition of prophylactic wisdom-teeth removal; often, the safer choice is to monitor unproblematic teeth for any worrying developments. Little medical evidence justifies the substitution of tooth-colored resins for typical metal amalgams to fill cavities. And what limited data we have don\u2019t clearly indicate whether it\u2019s better to repair a root-canaled tooth with a crown or a filling. When Cochrane researchers tried to determine whether faulty metal fillings should be repaired or replaced, they could not find a single study that met their standards.\n\u201cThe body of evidence for dentistry is disappointing,\u201d says Derek Richards, the director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Dentistry at the University of Dundee, in Scotland. \u201cDentists tend to want to treat or intervene. They are more akin to surgeons than they are to physicians. We suffer a little from that. Everybody keeps fiddling with stuff, trying out the newest thing, but they don\u2019t test them properly in a good-quality trial.\u201d\nThe general dearth of rigorous research on dental interventions gives dentists even more leverage over their patients. Should a patient somehow muster the gumption to question an initial diagnosis and consult the scientific literature, she would probably not find much to help her. When we submit to a dentist\u2019s examination, we are putting a great deal of trust in that dentist\u2019s experience and intuition\u2014and, of course, integrity.\nWhen Zeidler purchased Lund\u2019spractice, in February 2012, he inherited a massive collection of patients\u2019 dental histories and bills, a mix of electronic documents, handwritten charts, and X\u2011rays. By August, Zeidler had decided that if anything could explain the alarmingly abundant dental work in the mouths of Lund\u2019s patients, he would find it in those records. He spent every weekend for the next nine months examining the charts of hundreds of patients treated in the preceding five years. In a giant Excel spreadsheet, he logged every single procedure Lund had performed, so he could carry out some basic statistical analyses.\nThe numbers spoke for themselves. Year after year, Lund had performed certain procedures at extraordinarily high rates. Whereas a typical dentist might perform root canals on previously crowned teeth in only 3 to 7 percent of cases, Lund was performing them in 90 percent of cases. As Zeidler later alleged in court documents, Lund had performed invasive, costly, and seemingly unnecessary procedures on dozens and dozens of patients, some of whom he had been seeing for decades. Terry Mitchell and Joyce Cordi were far from alone. In fact, they had not even endured the worst of it.\nWhereas medicine has reckoned with some of its own tendencies toward excessive and misguided treatment, dentistry has lagged behind.\nDental crowns were one of Lund\u2019s most frequent treatments. A crown is a metal or ceramic cap that completely encases an injured or decayed tooth, which is first shaved to a peg so its new shell will fit. Crowns typically last 10 to 15 years. Lund not only gave his patients superfluous crowns; he also tended to replace them every five years\u2014the minimum interval of time before insurance companies will cover the procedure again.\nMore than 50 of Lund\u2019s patients also had ludicrously high numbers of root canals: 15, 20, 24. (A typical adult mouth has 32 teeth.) According to one lawsuit that has since been settled, a woman in her late 50s came to Lund with only 10 natural teeth; from 2003 to 2010, he gave her nine root canals and 12 crowns. The American Association of Endodontists claims that a root canal is a \u201cquick, comfortable procedure\u201d that is \u201cvery similar to a routine filling.\u201d In truth, a root canal is a much more radical operation than a filling. It takes longer, can cause significant discomfort, and may require multiple trips to a dentist or specialist. It\u2019s also much more costly.\nRoot canals are typically used to treat infections of the pulp\u2014the soft living core of a tooth. A dentist drills a hole through a tooth in order to access the root canals: long, narrow channels containing nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue. The dentist then repeatedly twists skinny metal files in and out of the canals to scrape away all the living tissue, irrigates the canals with disinfectant, and packs them with a rubberlike material. The whole process usually takes one to two hours. Afterward, sometimes at a second visit, the dentist will strengthen the tooth with a filling or crown. In the rare case that infection returns, the patient must go through the whole ordeal again or consider more advanced surgery.\nZeidler noticed that nearly every time Lund gave someone a root canal, he also charged for an incision and drainage, known as an I&D. During an I&D, a dentist lances an abscess in the mouth and drains the exudate, all while the patient is awake. In some cases the dentist slips a small rubber tube into the wound, which continues to drain fluids and remains in place for a few days. I&Ds are not routine adjuncts to root canals. They should be used only to treat severe infections, which occur in a minority of cases. Yet they were extremely common in Lund\u2019s practice. In 2009, for example, Lund billed his patients for 109 I&Ds. Zeidler asked many of those patients about the treatments, but none of them recalled what would almost certainly have been a memorable experience.\nIn addition to performing scores of seemingly unnecessary procedures that could result in chronic pain, medical complications, and further operations, Lund had apparently billed patients for treatments he had never administered. Zeidler was alarmed and distressed. \u201cWe go into this profession to care for patients,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat is why we become doctors. To find, I felt, someone was doing the exact opposite of that\u2014it was very hard, very hard to accept that someone was willing to do that.\u201d\nZeidler knew what he had to do next. As a dental professional, he had certain ethical obligations. He needed to confront Lund directly and give him the chance to account for all the anomalies. Even more daunting, in the absence of a credible explanation, he would have to divulge his discoveries to the patients Lund had bequeathed to him. He would have to tell them that the man to whom they had entrusted their care\u2014some of them for two decades\u2014had apparently deceived them for his own profit.\nThe idea of the dentist as potential charlatan has a long and rich history. In medieval Europe, barbers didn\u2019t just trim hair and shave beards; they were also surgeons, performing a range of minor operations including bloodletting, the administration of enemas, and tooth extraction. Barber surgeons, and the more specialized \u201ctooth drawers,\u201d would wrench, smash, and knock teeth out of people\u2019s mouths with an intimidating metal instrument called a dental key: Imagine a chimera of a hook, a hammer, and forceps. Sometimes the results were disastrous. In the 1700s, Thomas Berdmore, King George III\u2019s \u201cOperator for the Teeth,\u201d described one woman who lost \u201ca piece of jawbone as big as a walnut and three neighbouring molars\u201d at the hands of a local barber.\nBarber surgeons came to America as early as 1636. By the 18th century, dentistry was firmly established in the colonies as a trade akin to blacksmithing (Paul Revere was an early American craftsman of artisanal dentures). Itinerant dentists moved from town to town by carriage with carts of dreaded tools in tow, temporarily setting up shop in a tavern or town square. They yanked teeth or bored into them with hand drills, filling cavities with mercury, tin, gold, or molten lead. For anesthetic, they used arsenic, nutgalls, mustard seed, leeches. Mixed in with the honest tradesmen\u2014who genuinely believed in the therapeutic power of bloodsucking worms\u2014were swindlers who urged their customers to have numerous teeth removed in a single sitting or charged them extra to stuff their pitted molars with homemade gunk of dubious benefit.\nIn the mid-19th century, a pair of American dentists began to elevate their trade to the level of a profession. From 1839 to 1840, Horace Hayden and Chapin Harris established dentistry\u2019s first college, scientific journal, and national association. Some historical accounts claim that Hayden and Harris approached the University of Maryland\u2019s School of Medicine about adding dental instruction to the curriculum, only to be rebuffed by the resident physicians, who declared that dentistry was of little consequence. But no definitive proof of this encounter has ever surfaced.\nWhatever happened, from that point on, \u201cthe professions of dentistry and medicine would develop along separate paths,\u201d writes Mary Otto, a health journalist, in her recent book, Teeth. Becoming a practicing physician requires four years of medical school followed by a three-to-seven-year residency program, depending on the specialty. Dentists earn a degree in four years and, in most states, can immediately take the national board exams, get a license, and begin treating patients. (Some choose to continue training in a specialty, such as orthodontics or oral and maxillofacial surgery.) When physicians complete their residency, they typically work for a hospital, university, or large health-care organization with substantial oversight, strict ethical codes, and standardized treatment regimens. By contrast, about 80 percent of the nation\u2019s 200,000 active dentists have individual practices, and although they are bound by a code of ethics, they typically don\u2019t have the same level of oversight.\nThroughout history, many physicians have lamented the segregation of dentistry and medicine. Acting as though oral health is somehow divorced from one\u2019s overall well-being is absurd; the two are inextricably linked. Oral bacteria and the toxins they produce can migrate through the bloodstream and airways, potentially damaging the heart and lungs. Poor oral health is associated with narrowing arteries, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and respiratory disease, possibly due to a complex interplay of oral microbes and the immune system. And some research suggests that gum disease can be an early sign of diabetes, indicating a relationship between sugar, oral bacteria, and chronic inflammation.\nDentistry\u2019s academic and professional isolation has been especially detrimental to its own scientific inquiry. Most major medical associations around the world have long endorsed evidence-based medicine. The idea is to shift focus away from intuition, anecdote, and received wisdom, and toward the conclusions of rigorous clinical research. Although the phrase evidence-based medicine was coined in 1991, the concept began taking shape in the 1960s, if not earlier (some scholars trace its origins all the way back to the 17th century). In contrast, the dental community did not begin having similar conversations until the mid-1990s. There are dozens of journals and organizations devoted to evidence-based medicine, but only a handful devoted to evidence-based dentistry.\nIn the past decade, a small cohort of dentists has worked diligently to promote evidence-based dentistry, hosting workshops, publishing clinical-practice guidelines based on systematic reviews of research, and creating websites that curate useful resources. But its adoption \u201chas been a relatively slow process,\u201d as a 2016 commentary in the Contemporary Clinical Dentistry journal put it. Part of the problem is funding: Because dentistry is often sidelined from medicine at large, it simply does not receive as much money from the government and industry to tackle these issues. \u201cAt a recent conference, very few practitioners were even aware of the existence of evidence-based clinical guidelines,\u201d says Elliot Abt, a professor of oral medicine at the University of Illinois. \u201cYou can publish a guideline in a journal, but passive dissemination of information is clearly not adequate for real change.\u201d\nAmong other problems, dentistry\u2019s struggle to embrace scientific inquiry has left dentists with considerable latitude to advise unnecessary procedures\u2014whether intentionally or not. The standard euphemism for this proclivity is overtreatment. Favored procedures, many of which are elaborate and steeply priced, include root canals, the application of crowns and veneers, teeth whitening and filing, deep cleaning, gum grafts, fillings for \u201cmicrocavities\u201d\u2014incipient lesions that do not require immediate treatment\u2014and superfluous restorations and replacements, such as swapping old metal fillings for modern resin ones. Whereas medicine has made progress in reckoning with at least some of its own tendencies toward excessive and misguided treatment, dentistry is lagging behind. It remains \u201clargely focused upon surgical procedures to treat the symptoms of disease,\u201d Mary Otto writes. \u201cAmerica\u2019s dental care system continues to reward those surgical procedures far more than it does prevention.\u201d\n\u201cExcessive diagnosis and treatment are endemic,\u201d says Jeffrey H. Camm, a dentist of more than 35 years who wryly described his peers\u2019 penchant for \u201ccreative diagnosis\u201d in a 2013 commentary published by the American Dental Association. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be damning. I think the majority of dentists are pretty good.\u201d But many have \u201cthis attitude of \u2018Oh, here\u2019s a spot, I\u2019ve got to do something.\u2019 I\u2019ve been contacted by all kinds of practitioners who are upset because patients come in and they already have three crowns, or 12 fillings, or another dentist told them that their 2-year-old child has several cavities and needs to be sedated for the procedure.\u201d\nTrish Walraven, who worked as a dental hygienist for 25 years and now manages a dental-software company with her husband in Texas, recalls many troubling cases: \u201cWe would see patients seeking a second opinion, and they had treatment plans telling them they need eight fillings in virgin teeth. We would look at X-rays and say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u2019 It was blatantly overtreatment\u2014drilling into teeth that did not need it whatsoever.\u201d\nJoyce Cordi\u2019s new dentist says her X-rays resemble those of someone who had reconstructive facial surgery following a car crash.\nStudies that explicitly focus on overtreatment in dentistry are rare, but a recent field experiment provides some clues about its pervasiveness. A team of researchers at ETH Zurich, a Swiss university, asked a volunteer patient with three tiny, shallow cavities to visit 180 randomly selected dentists in Zurich. The Swiss Dental Guidelines state that such minor cavities do not require fillings; rather, the dentist should monitor the decay and encourage the patient to brush regularly, which can reverse the damage. Despite this, 50 of the 180 dentists suggested unnecessary treatment. Their recommendations were incongruous: Collectively, the overzealous dentists singled out 13 different teeth for drilling; each advised one to six fillings. Similarly, in an investigation for Reader\u2019s Digest, the writer William Ecenbarger visited 50 dentists in 28 states in the U.S. and received prescriptions ranging from a single crown to a full-mouth reconstruction, with the price tag starting at about $500 and going up to nearly $30,000.\nA multitude of factors has conspired to create both the opportunity and the motive for widespread overtreatment in dentistry. In addition to dentistry\u2019s seclusion from the greater medical community, its traditional emphasis on procedure rather than prevention, and its lack of rigorous self-evaluation, there are economic explanations. The financial burden of entering the profession is high and rising. In the U.S., the average debt of a dental-school graduate is more than $200,000. And then there\u2019s the expense of finding an office, buying new equipment, and hiring staff to set up a private practice. A dentist\u2019s income is entirely dependent on the number and type of procedures he or she performs; a routine cleaning and examination earns only a baseline fee of about $200.\nIn parallel with the rising cost of dental school, the amount of tooth decay in many countries\u2019 populations has declined dramatically over the past four decades, mostly thanks to the introduction of mass-produced fluoridated toothpaste in the 1950s and \u201960s. In the 1980s, with fewer genuine problems to treat, some practitioners turned to the newly flourishing industry of cosmetic dentistry, promoting elective procedures such as bleaching, teeth filing and straightening, gum lifts, and veneers. It\u2019s easy to see how dentists, hoping to buoy their income, would be tempted to recommend frequent exams and proactive treatments\u2014a small filling here, a new crown there\u2014even when waiting and watching would be better. It\u2019s equally easy to imagine how that behavior might escalate.\n\u201cIf I were to sum it up, I really think the majority of dentists are great. But for some reason we seem to drift toward this attitude of \u2018I\u2019ve got tools so I\u2019ve got to fix something\u2019 much too often,\u201d says Jeffrey Camm. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s greed, or paying off debt, or maybe it\u2019s someone\u2019s training. It\u2019s easy to lose sight of the fact that even something that seems minor, like a filling, involves removal of a human body part. It just adds to the whole idea that you go to a physician feeling bad and you walk out feeling better, but you go to a dentist feeling good and you walk out feeling bad.\u201d\nIn the summer of 2013, Zeidlerasked several other dentists to review Lund\u2019s records. They all agreed with his conclusions. The likelihood that Lund\u2019s patients genuinely needed that many treatments was extremely low. And there was no medical evidence to justify many of Lund\u2019s decisions or to explain the phantom procedures. Zeidler confronted Lund about his discoveries in several face-to-face meetings. When I asked Zeidler how those meetings went, he offered a single sentence\u2014\u201cI decided shortly thereafter to take legal action\u201d\u2014and declined to comment further. (Repeated attempts were made to contact Lund and his lawyer for this story, but neither responded.)\nOne by one, Zeidler began to write, call, or sit down with patients who had previously been in Lund\u2019s care, explaining what he had uncovered. They were shocked and angry. Lund had been charismatic and professional. They had assumed that his diagnoses and treatments were meant to keep them healthy. Isn\u2019t that what doctors do? \u201cIt makes you feel like you have been violated,\u201d Terry Mitchell says\u2014\u201csomebody performing stuff on your body that doesn\u2019t need to be done.\u201d Joyce Cordi recalls a \u201cmoment of absolute fury\u201d when she first learned of Lund\u2019s deceit. On top of all the needless operations, \u201cthere were all kinds of drains and things that I paid for and the insurance company paid for that never happened,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you can\u2019t read the dentalese.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of them felt, How can I be so stupid? Or Why didn\u2019t I go elsewhere?\u201d Zeidler says. \u201cBut this is not about intellect. It\u2019s about betrayal of trust.\u201d\nIn October 2013, Zeidler sued Lund for misrepresenting his practice and breaching their contract. In the lawsuit, Zeidler and his lawyers argued that Lund\u2019s reported practice income of $729,000 to $988,000 a year was \u201ca result of fraudulent billing activity, billing for treatment that was unnecessary and billing for treatment which was never performed.\u201d The suit was settled for a confidential amount. From 2014 to 2017, 10 of Lund\u2019s former patients, including Mitchell and Cordi, sued him for a mix of fraud, deceit, battery, financial elder abuse, and dental malpractice. They collectively reached a nearly $3 million settlement, paid out by Lund\u2019s insurance company. (Lund did not admit to any wrongdoing.)\nLund was arrested in May 2016 and released on $250,000 bail. The Santa Clara County district attorney\u2019s office is prosecuting a criminal case against him based on 26 counts of insurance fraud. At the time of his arraignment, he said he was innocent of all charges. The Dental Board of California is seeking to revoke or suspend Lund\u2019s license, which is currently inactive.\nMany of Lund\u2019s former patients worry about their future health. A root canal is not a permanent fix. It requires maintenance and, in the long run, may need to be replaced with a dental implant. One of Mitchell\u2019s root canals has already failed: The tooth fractured, and an infection developed. He said that in order to treat the infection, the tooth was extracted and he underwent a multistage procedure involving a bone graft and months of healing before an implant and a crown were fixed in place. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much these root canals are going to cost me down the line,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cSix thousand dollars a pop for an implant\u2014it adds up pretty quick.\u201d\nJoyce Cordi\u2019s new dentist says her X\u2011rays resemble those of someone who had reconstructive facial surgery following a car crash. Because Lund installed her new dental bridges improperly, one of her teeth is continually damaged by everyday chewing. \u201cIt hurts like hell,\u201d she says. She has to wear a mouth guard every night.\nWhat some of Lund\u2019s former patients regret most are the psychological repercussions of his alleged duplicity: the erosion of the covenant between practitioner and patient, the germ of doubt that infects the mind. \u201cYou lose your trust,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cYou become cynical. I have become more that way, and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\u201cHe damaged the trust I need to have in the people who take care of me,\u201d Cordi says. \u201cHe damaged my trust in mankind. That\u2019s an unforgivable crime.\u201d\nThis article appears in the May 2019 print edition with the headline \u201cThe Trouble With Dentistry.\u201d",

None of them came with him here for the weekend.</p>\n<p>The why-not-me stage of the Democratic presidential primaries keeps getting extended every time yet another politician asks the question and buys a plane ticket here, and the mayor of New York City wants in.</p>\n<p>So talking to 40 people here in a union hall on a Sunday afternoon was worth it, even if that meant&mdash;again&mdash;annoying an actual candidate he&rsquo;d spent years building a relationship with. He can&rsquo;t seem to resist.</p>\n<p>Four years ago, it was Hillary Clinton. He&rsquo;d managed her 2000 Senate campaign and made a big show of inviting Bill Clinton to administer his first oath of office as mayor in 2014.</p>\n<p>But then, as the presidential race stepped up in 2015, he insisted that he wasn&rsquo;t sure Hillary Clinton was progressive enough, and that since he had to stay neutral for the sake of a candidate forum (which he never actually made happen), he couldn&rsquo;t endorse. When he did finally back her, the only people who cared were the Clinton aides who were mad that it had taken him so long.</p>\n<p>This time around, it&rsquo;s Bernie Sanders he&rsquo;s rebuffing. In 2018, he asked Sanders to administer the oath of office for his second term and repeatedly gushed about him, and even attended a gathering of the Sanders Institute last November in Burlington, Vermont. His response to Sanders announcing his second run last week: scrambling a trip of his own to Sioux City and Des Moines.</p>\n<p>De Blasio could have been prepping to introduce Sanders as a favorite son in Brooklyn on Saturday for what will be the kickoff rally of the second campaign, not far from where the senator grew up and near the neighborhood the mayor used to represent on the city council. The senator&rsquo;s campaign probably would have been open to that and to the buzz it would have produced about the strength of his 2020 campaign. Or he could be looking to horse-trade his endorsement with one of the many other candidates seeking to prove their own progressive credentials, and build up his power that way.</p>\n<p>Instead, de Blasio ducked behind the doorway, just out of sight, until he could make his entrance in the union hall where those 40 people had come to see him on Sunday afternoon. He&rsquo;d spent the morning doing a photo-op meeting with Tom Vilsack, the former governor and part-time Democratic gatekeeper and elder statesman, and another with Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie, who later pointed out that New York City is bigger than 41 states and that the mayor comes with an &ldquo;everyday perspective&rdquo; of how government affects people&rsquo;s lives.</p>\n<p>He waited for his big introduction, piping up &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready!&rdquo; at one point, and then walked in from the back of the room.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very personal reality,&rdquo; de Blasio explained to reporters about his decision to come to Iowa on Saturday. He didn&rsquo;t have a timetable for deciding whether he would run, he added on Sunday. He has to talk to his family.</p>\n<p>He urged the people who came to the event hosted by the Asian &amp; Latino PAC to invest in wind power (there are turbines all over the state), told them to stop talking about Donald Trump (most Democrats running haven&rsquo;t been mentioning the president much at all), and recommended that Democrats reach out to farmers (other Democratic presidential hopefuls have been doing events at farms).</p>\n<p>It was a New Yorker&rsquo;s view of what&rsquo;s happening in Iowa and the rest of the country, and his insistent sense that he knows what to do about it from the people he&rsquo;s talking to more than a thousand miles away.</p>\n<p>He drew the biggest applause when he said Democrats need to get smarter about being bolder, for the sake of their politics and their values. Tax the rich, he said. Don&rsquo;t let Republicans make Democrats out as the party of the elites.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is plenty of money in this world, there is plenty of money in this country&mdash;it&rsquo;s just in the wrong hands,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>He stressed that Democrats need &ldquo;a positive vision,&rdquo; in a way that made him seem mostly unaware of what&rsquo;s been said on the ground by the other Democratic presidential hopefuls; five others hit events across Iowa the same weekend, all but one on a repeat trip to the state. He talked up his record of progressive governance in New York, including establishing universal prekindergarten, though he spoke mostly about proposals he&rsquo;s made that haven&rsquo;t become law, including one that would give everyone in the city health care.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in a position to compare [myself] against the rest of the field, because I am not a candidate at this moment. I can only say what I hope for my party,&rdquo; he said after the event, when asked what he was actually proposing that other candidates haven&rsquo;t. &ldquo;We have to have a progressive as our nominee. We have to be able to speak to working people across our whole country. We also have to have a nominee who is believable as a leader in such an important position.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Every 18 months or so since he won the mayor&rsquo;s race in 2013, de Blasio has made a flashy play for headlines about national politics, talking like he might just be up to something. His current Fairness PAC is the latest pot of money he&rsquo;s put together to support his political efforts. In December 2017, the last time he was in Des Moines, he insisted that his appearance as the featured speaker of the Progress Iowa holiday party was absolutely not about running for president, and he wasn&rsquo;t running for president. He ended a press conference by asking reporters to watch him take out a piece of gum and begin chewing it as he walked out of the room, to show he could be mayor and involved in national politics at the same time. On Sunday, he used the line again, though this time the chewing, or maybe the walking, was actively teasing that he might run.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everyone who looks at the facts understands New York is moving in the right direction. But I feel very strongly that there&rsquo;s a lot we have to fix in our country too, for New Yorkers and for everyone,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s team was annoyed with this kind of behavior four years ago, and still hasn&rsquo;t forgiven him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was transparently obvious that he was dragging out his endorsement of HRC to make it look as if he was forcing progressive concessions from her to aid his own standing, and it didn&rsquo;t help him, and his eventual endorsement of her was a nonevent,&rdquo; an adviser said on Sunday afternoon.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s not like the approach impressed Sanders and his team, who saw de Blasio as playing games around what always seemed obvious to them would eventually be a Clinton endorsement. They aren&rsquo;t much impressed with how he&rsquo;s handling things this time, though the senator&rsquo;s aides declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Flying to Iowa for the weekend is a lot easier than putting together an actual campaign, even if this trip did get partially sidelined by a blizzard that temporarily shut down the interstates. But de Blasio wants in on this part, when all it takes is a few plane tickets and hotel rooms to play at presidential speculation&mdash;and on seeming like he&rsquo;s implicitly rebuffing what Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, his clearest ideological allies, have put forward.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Each candidate has strengths,&rdquo; he said when asked about those two. &ldquo;I have a lot of respect for all of those folks, but I&rsquo;m simply saying our party has to get a couple things right. We have to have a clear progressive message, we have to be unapologetic about it, we have to show people we can produce results for them.&rdquo; First, he&rsquo;ll have to see whether he can actually produce a presidential campaign for himself.</p>\n<p>We want to hear what you think about this article. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/contact/letters/\">Submit a letter</a> to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.</p>",

                "text": "DES MOINES\u2014Bill de Blasio\u2019s friends, allies, and top aides think his flirtation with running for president is ridiculous. None of them came with him here for the weekend.\nThe why-not-me stage of the Democratic presidential primaries keeps getting extended every time yet another politician asks the question and buys a plane ticket here, and the mayor of New York City wants in.\nSo talking to 40 people here in a union hall on a Sunday afternoon was worth it, even if that meant\u2014again\u2014annoying an actual candidate he\u2019d spent years building a relationship with. He can\u2019t seem to resist.\nFour years ago, it was Hillary Clinton. He\u2019d managed her 2000 Senate campaign and made a big show of inviting Bill Clinton to administer his first oath of office as mayor in 2014.\nBut then, as the presidential race stepped up in 2015, he insisted that he wasn\u2019t sure Hillary Clinton was progressive enough, and that since he had to stay neutral for the sake of a candidate forum (which he never actually made happen), he couldn\u2019t endorse. When he did finally back her, the only people who cared were the Clinton aides who were mad that it had taken him so long.\nThis time around, it\u2019s Bernie Sanders he\u2019s rebuffing. In 2018, he asked Sanders to administer the oath of office for his second term and repeatedly gushed about him, and even attended a gathering of the Sanders Institute last November in Burlington, Vermont. His response to Sanders announcing his second run last week: scrambling a trip of his own to Sioux City and Des Moines.\nDe Blasio could have been prepping to introduce Sanders as a favorite son in Brooklyn on Saturday for what will be the kickoff rally of the second campaign, not far from where the senator grew up and near the neighborhood the mayor used to represent on the city council. The senator\u2019s campaign probably would have been open to that and to the buzz it would have produced about the strength of his 2020 campaign. Or he could be looking to horse-trade his endorsement with one of the many other candidates seeking to prove their own progressive credentials, and build up his power that way.\nInstead, de Blasio ducked behind the doorway, just out of sight, until he could make his entrance in the union hall where those 40 people had come to see him on Sunday afternoon. He\u2019d spent the morning doing a photo-op meeting with Tom Vilsack, the former governor and part-time Democratic gatekeeper and elder statesman, and another with Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie, who later pointed out that New York City is bigger than 41 states and that the mayor comes with an \u201ceveryday perspective\u201d of how government affects people\u2019s lives.\nHe waited for his big introduction, piping up \u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d at one point, and then walked in from the back of the room.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very personal reality,\u201d de Blasio explained to reporters about his decision to come to Iowa on Saturday. He didn\u2019t have a timetable for deciding whether he would run, he added on Sunday. He has to talk to his family.\nHe urged the people who came to the event hosted by the Asian & Latino PAC to invest in wind power (there are turbines all over the state), told them to stop talking about Donald Trump (most Democrats running haven\u2019t been mentioning the president much at all), and recommended that Democrats reach out to farmers (other Democratic presidential hopefuls have been doing events at farms).\nIt was a New Yorker\u2019s view of what\u2019s happening in Iowa and the rest of the country, and his insistent sense that he knows what to do about it from the people he\u2019s talking to more than a thousand miles away.\nHe drew the biggest applause when he said Democrats need to get smarter about being bolder, for the sake of their politics and their values. Tax the rich, he said. Don\u2019t let Republicans make Democrats out as the party of the elites.\n\u201cThere is plenty of money in this world, there is plenty of money in this country\u2014it\u2019s just in the wrong hands,\u201d he said.\nHe stressed that Democrats need \u201ca positive vision,\u201d in a way that made him seem mostly unaware of what\u2019s been said on the ground by the other Democratic presidential hopefuls; five others hit events across Iowa the same weekend, all but one on a repeat trip to the state. He talked up his record of progressive governance in New York, including establishing universal prekindergarten, though he spoke mostly about proposals he\u2019s made that haven\u2019t become law, including one that would give everyone in the city health care.\n\u201cI\u2019m not in a position to compare [myself] against the rest of the field, because I am not a candidate at this moment. I can only say what I hope for my party,\u201d he said after the event, when asked what he was actually proposing that other candidates haven\u2019t. \u201cWe have to have a progressive as our nominee. We have to be able to speak to working people across our whole country. We also have to have a nominee who is believable as a leader in such an important position.\u201d\nEvery 18 months or so since he won the mayor\u2019s race in 2013, de Blasio has made a flashy play for headlines about national politics, talking like he might just be up to something. His current Fairness PAC is the latest pot of money he\u2019s put together to support his political efforts. In December 2017, the last time he was in Des Moines, he insisted that his appearance as the featured speaker of the Progress Iowa holiday party was absolutely not about running for president, and he wasn\u2019t running for president. He ended a press conference by asking reporters to watch him take out a piece of gum and begin chewing it as he walked out of the room, to show he could be mayor and involved in national politics at the same time. On Sunday, he used the line again, though this time the chewing, or maybe the walking, was actively teasing that he might run.\n\u201cEveryone who looks at the facts understands New York is moving in the right direction. But I feel very strongly that there\u2019s a lot we have to fix in our country too, for New Yorkers and for everyone,\u201d he said.\nClinton\u2019s team was annoyed with this kind of behavior four years ago, and still hasn\u2019t forgiven him.\n\u201cIt was transparently obvious that he was dragging out his endorsement of HRC to make it look as if he was forcing progressive concessions from her to aid his own standing, and it didn\u2019t help him, and his eventual endorsement of her was a nonevent,\u201d an adviser said on Sunday afternoon.\nAnd it\u2019s not like the approach impressed Sanders and his team, who saw de Blasio as playing games around what always seemed obvious to them would eventually be a Clinton endorsement. They aren\u2019t much impressed with how he\u2019s handling things this time, though the senator\u2019s aides declined to comment.\nFlying to Iowa for the weekend is a lot easier than putting together an actual campaign, even if this trip did get partially sidelined by a blizzard that temporarily shut down the interstates. But de Blasio wants in on this part, when all it takes is a few plane tickets and hotel rooms to play at presidential speculation\u2014and on seeming like he\u2019s implicitly rebuffing what Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, his clearest ideological allies, have put forward.\n\u201cEach candidate has strengths,\u201d he said when asked about those two. \u201cI have a lot of respect for all of those folks, but I\u2019m simply saying our party has to get a couple things right. We have to have a clear progressive message, we have to be unapologetic about it, we have to show people we can produce results for them.\u201d First, he\u2019ll have to see whether he can actually produce a presidential campaign for himself.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

I want to be clear that I condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What he didn&rsquo;t include was that one of the people already advising him and helping him write those launch speeches is one of his most famously aggressive supporters online.</p>\n<p>Since December, David Sirota has, on Twitter, on the website <em>Capital &amp; Main</em>, and in columns in <em>The Guardian</em>, been trashing most of Sanders&rsquo;s Democratic opponents&mdash;all without disclosing his work with Sanders&mdash;and has been pushing back on critics by saying that he was criticizing the other Democrats as a journalist.<a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/sanders-promised-civility-hired-twitter-attack-dog/585259/\">*</a> He centered many of his attacks on Beto O&rsquo;Rourke, but he also bashed Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Joe Biden, Kirsten Gillibrand, Michael Bennet, John Hickenlooper, Mike Bloomberg, and even Andrew Cuomo.</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/Pasted_image_at_2019_03_19_3_09_PM/01cb330ac.png\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/Pasted_image_at_2019_03_19_3_09_PM/01cb330ac.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/Pasted_image_at_2019_03_19_3_09_PM/01cb330ac.png\"></img></picture><figcaption>A screenshot of one of the more than 20,000 tweets that Sirota deleted yesterday.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for The Guardian, Deepal Patadia, said that Sirota informed the newspaper that he was in conversations with the Sanders team starting in January, and did not file a column forward from that point. Patadia did not address if this account was based on anything other than Sirota&rsquo;s characterizations, and whether The Guardian was aware of conversations that Sirota was having with Sanders aides through 2018, as people with direct knowledge say he was. Sirota himself would not address this on the record.</p>\n<p>Sirota&rsquo;s hiring as a senior adviser and speechwriter was announced by the Sanders campaign on Tuesday morning after <em>The Atlantic</em> contacted the campaign and inquired about the undisclosed role Sirota held while attacking other Democrats.</p>\n<p>Faiz Shakir, Sanders&rsquo;s campaign manager, confirmed in an interview on Tuesday afternoon that Sirota had been in an advisory role prior to his hiring on March 11. &ldquo;He was advising beforehand,&rdquo; Shakir said, explaining that Sirota&rsquo;s informal work for Sanders goes back months, and was meant to be a trial period to see how the senator, who famously likes to write every word that he says himself, would work with a speechwriter.</p>\n<p>The online fury of Sanders&rsquo;s supporters was one of the most defining characteristics of his 2016 campaign. Sanders himself has said he is sensitive to that, as well as to accusations that he created divisions within the Democratic Party during his 2016 run against Hillary Clinton. &ldquo;Negative attacks on Democratic candidates,&rdquo; Sanders said in 2018, criticizing the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for putting out damaging information about an opponent to a favored candidate in a primary, &ldquo;just continues the process of debasing the Democratic system in this country, and is why so many people are disgusted with politics.&quot;</p>\n<p>When people have questioned his tactics, Sirota has called them &ldquo;mentally incapacitated.&rdquo; Responding in mid-January to those who criticized him online for preemptively railing against the record of O&rsquo;Rourke, who had not yet entered the race but had been a huge source of concern for Sanders allies since talk of O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s potential presidential run picked up last year, Sirota tweeted, &ldquo;The screaming temper tantrums by Democratic Party operatives whenever reporters scrutinize a lawmaker&rsquo;s voting record is something to behold. These people quite literally hate democracy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At another point, he said his critics &ldquo;are deranged and/or running a deliberate disinfo campaign.&rdquo; &ldquo;Positively unhinged,&rdquo; he wrote about them a separate time.</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/Image_from_iOS/0188d6e0a.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/Image_from_iOS/0188d6e0a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/Image_from_iOS/0188d6e0a.jpg\"></img></picture><figcaption>This tweet was sent on December 27, though the screenshot was taken contemporaneously.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Read those comments, Shakir paused. &ldquo;He used those exact words?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he regrets the tone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>None of those comments can be found online anymore. On Monday night, after being contacted for a second time by <em>The Atlantic</em> with a list of specific questions about his undisclosed work for Sanders, Sirota did not respond to the email but deleted more than 20,000 tweets. He left fewer than 200 online.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday morning, minutes after his position was announced by the Sanders campaign in a long list of new hires, Sirota said he hadn&rsquo;t been able to respond to my initial inquiries because he&rsquo;d been caring for his sick child. He did post a photo on Twitter of himself bowling on Monday evening, wearing a turkey hat.</p>\n<p>In a brief emailed response, Sirota attributed the scrubbing of his account to having an &ldquo;autodeleter that periodically and automatically deletes tweets. I started doing this many months ago.&rdquo; He did not respond when asked if it was a coincidence that the tweets were deleted hours after I contacted him and the morning before he was announced as a Sanders employee. He did not respond to other questions about why he had not disclosed his role with Sanders either on Twitter or on the website <em>Capital &amp; Main</em>, a left-leaning nonprofit news site.<a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/sanders-promised-civility-hired-twitter-attack-dog/585259/\">*</a> (After the publication of this piece, <em>Capital &amp; Main&rsquo;s </em>publisher said in a statement to <em>The Atlantic</em> that &ldquo;<em>Capital &amp; Main </em>did not, and would never, knowingly allow Mr. Sirota or any reporter to use our site to advocate for or against a political candidate.&rdquo;) Sirota&rsquo;s ties to Sanders go back 20 years, to when he was Sanders&rsquo;s press secretary in the House of Representatives. He has always portrayed that role as a past association and nothing more, despite his continuing affinity for Sanders.</p>\n<p>Screenshots taken before the mass Twitter deletion preserve the role that Sirota was playing to his 125,000 followers, trying to turn the early online conversation about the 2020 primary race against other candidates, all while unofficially advising Sanders.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s accused Harris of giving in to big donors and changing her stance on health care, and questioned how she will defend and define being &ldquo;tough on crime.&rdquo; He responded to Booker getting into the race by reminding people of the New Jersey senator&rsquo;s defense of Bain Capital, Mitt Romney&rsquo;s former company, in 2012, and a 2017 vote favored by the pharmaceutical industry that has become a big target for Sanders and his supporters.</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/image_1/00e79d1dc.png\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/image_1/00e79d1dc.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/image_1/00e79d1dc.png\"></img></picture></figure>\n<p>Sirota has repeatedly attacked Bennet, his home-state senator from Colorado, over his management of the Denver school system, which he has said is &ldquo;now ripped apart by chaos.&rdquo; He has also attacked Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor and a current Democratic presidential candidate, for the poor state of Colorado&rsquo;s roads. He has criticized both Bennet and Hickenlooper for not responding in what he thought would have been the appropriate way during a teachers&rsquo; strike in Denver.</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/Pasted_image_at_2019_03_19_3_10_PM/649251249.png\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/Pasted_image_at_2019_03_19_3_10_PM/649251249.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/Pasted_image_at_2019_03_19_3_10_PM/649251249.png\"></img></picture></figure>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/image/cae895987.png\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/image/cae895987.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/image/cae895987.png\"></img></picture></figure>\n<p>Responding to an NBC News op-ed in January calling Biden &ldquo;the Democrats&rsquo; best chance to beat Trump,&rdquo; Sirota highlighted that the author used to work for the American Legislative Exchange Council, and wrote that Biden &ldquo;was just endorsed&rdquo; by a former spokesperson for &ldquo;the group that pushes right-wing legislation in state capitals across the country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Reacting to a CNBC article about Gillibrand&rsquo;s outreach to big donors, he wrote at the beginning of February, &ldquo;Welcome to the oligarchy,&rdquo; and attacked her for the time she spent at a law firm with the tobacco company Philip Morris as a client. In another tweet, he mocked her for endorsing Representative Joe Crowley last year in his losing primary campaign against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p>\n<p>He also knocked Bloomberg for how much of his fortune he spent on a presidential campaign, and for his &ldquo;allegedly awesome climate policies,&rdquo; which he contrasted by pointing out the former mayor&rsquo;s support for responsible fracking.</p>\n<p>Asked if these attacks align with the pledge for a clean and positive campaign that Sanders has made, Shakir said, &ldquo;I can only promise and pledge the manner in which he is going to work on this campaign is consistent with those values.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He said that he is sure Sirota is apologetic. &ldquo;All I can say is, going forward, he is very much a team player,&rdquo; Shakir said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, before officially joining the Sanders campaign a little more than a week ago, Sirota promoted meetings of the campaign and the Sanders-aligned Our Revolution group.</p>\n<p>Among the few people in the 2020 conversation whom he has said positive things about: Jay Inslee and Bill de Blasio. Both have appeared on his podcast.</p>\n<p>And then there&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Rourke. Sirota went after the former Texas congressman&rsquo;s campaign-finance and voting records. He then turned those into an op-ed on December 20 in <em>The Guardian</em>, writing that &ldquo;a new analysis of congressional votes from the non-profit news organisation <em>Capital &amp; Main</em> shows that even as O&rsquo;Rourke represented <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.docdroid.net/JZXMmxl/arranged-by-pvi-rank-1.pdf#page=7\">one of the most</a> <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'\" href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/texas/16/\">solidly Democratic congressional districts in the United States</a>, he has frequently voted against the majority of House Democrats in support of Republican bills and <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'\" href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/beto-orourke/\">Trump administration priorities</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This story was reported by David Sirota of <em><a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'\" href=\"https://capitalandmain.com/\">Capital &amp; Main</a></em>,&rdquo; a note at the end of the article read. He wrote another piece two days later, headlined &ldquo;Beto O&rsquo;Rourke Is the New Obama. And That&rsquo;s the Last Thing We Need.&rdquo;<a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/sanders-promised-civility-hired-twitter-attack-dog/585259/\">**</a></p>\n<p>Pushing back against those who wondered why he was tearing into another Democrat, he dismissed via Twitter &ldquo;the trolls trying to de-credential me &amp; claim I&rsquo;m not a &lsquo;real journalist.&rsquo;&rdquo; In December, he said anyone who questioned his motives &ldquo;illustrates something important: while Dems deride Trump&rsquo;s war on the press, there are a cadre of Dems who try to bully campaign finance reporters if they report facts that are inconvenient to Democratic candidates.&rdquo; He also tweeted that if &ldquo;you are a political reporter or DC thinktanker, you see everything in front of you as a political scheme &amp; cant fathom the idea of non-partisan issue-based missions. Electoral politics is the prism through which you view the world &amp; so you assume everything is political.&rdquo; He added later that he&rsquo;s not engaged in &ldquo;some sort of secretive political conspiracy for a particular candidate.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sirota sent a note to his own email list after the hiring announcement was made, writing, &ldquo;I believe journalism is an extremely important and necessary line of work, and I will miss it (and one day in the future, it is possible I may return to it).&rdquo;</p>\n<p>His hiring has been in discussion among the top levels of Sanders&rsquo;s campaign since before the senator launched his bid for the presidency, according to Shakir and other sources with direct knowledge of internal discussions, but Sirota did not portray it that way.</p>",

                "text": "Updated on March 25 at 6:11 p.m. ET.\nShortly before he gave speeches launching his 2020 campaign earlier this month, Bernie Sanders emailed his supporters, urging them to \u201cdo our very best to engage respectfully with our Democratic opponents\u2014talking about the issues we are fighting for, not about personalities or past grievances. I want to be clear that I condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space.\u201d\nWhat he didn\u2019t include was that one of the people already advising him and helping him write those launch speeches is one of his most famously aggressive supporters online.\nSince December, David Sirota has, on Twitter, on the website Capital & Main, and in columns in The Guardian, been trashing most of Sanders\u2019s Democratic opponents\u2014all without disclosing his work with Sanders\u2014and has been pushing back on critics by saying that he was criticizing the other Democrats as a journalist.* He centered many of his attacks on Beto O\u2019Rourke, but he also bashed Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Joe Biden, Kirsten Gillibrand, Michael Bennet, John Hickenlooper, Mike Bloomberg, and even Andrew Cuomo.\nOn Wednesday, a spokeswoman for The Guardian, Deepal Patadia, said that Sirota informed the newspaper that he was in conversations with the Sanders team starting in January, and did not file a column forward from that point. Patadia did not address if this account was based on anything other than Sirota\u2019s characterizations, and whether The Guardian was aware of conversations that Sirota was having with Sanders aides through 2018, as people with direct knowledge say he was. Sirota himself would not address this on the record.\nSirota\u2019s hiring as a senior adviser and speechwriter was announced by the Sanders campaign on Tuesday morning after The Atlantic contacted the campaign and inquired about the undisclosed role Sirota held while attacking other Democrats.\nFaiz Shakir, Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, confirmed in an interview on Tuesday afternoon that Sirota had been in an advisory role prior to his hiring on March 11. \u201cHe was advising beforehand,\u201d Shakir said, explaining that Sirota\u2019s informal work for Sanders goes back months, and was meant to be a trial period to see how the senator, who famously likes to write every word that he says himself, would work with a speechwriter.\nThe online fury of Sanders\u2019s supporters was one of the most defining characteristics of his 2016 campaign. Sanders himself has said he is sensitive to that, as well as to accusations that he created divisions within the Democratic Party during his 2016 run against Hillary Clinton. \u201cNegative attacks on Democratic candidates,\u201d Sanders said in 2018, criticizing the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for putting out damaging information about an opponent to a favored candidate in a primary, \u201cjust continues the process of debasing the Democratic system in this country, and is why so many people are disgusted with politics.\"\nWhen people have questioned his tactics, Sirota has called them \u201cmentally incapacitated.\u201d Responding in mid-January to those who criticized him online for preemptively railing against the record of O\u2019Rourke, who had not yet entered the race but had been a huge source of concern for Sanders allies since talk of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s potential presidential run picked up last year, Sirota tweeted, \u201cThe screaming temper tantrums by Democratic Party operatives whenever reporters scrutinize a lawmaker\u2019s voting record is something to behold. These people quite literally hate democracy.\u201d\nAt another point, he said his critics \u201care deranged and/or running a deliberate disinfo campaign.\u201d \u201cPositively unhinged,\u201d he wrote about them a separate time.\nRead those comments, Shakir paused. \u201cHe used those exact words?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m sure he regrets the tone.\u201d\nNone of those comments can be found online anymore. On Monday night, after being contacted for a second time by The Atlantic with a list of specific questions about his undisclosed work for Sanders, Sirota did not respond to the email but deleted more than 20,000 tweets. He left fewer than 200 online.\nOn Tuesday morning, minutes after his position was announced by the Sanders campaign in a long list of new hires, Sirota said he hadn\u2019t been able to respond to my initial inquiries because he\u2019d been caring for his sick child. He did post a photo on Twitter of himself bowling on Monday evening, wearing a turkey hat.\nIn a brief emailed response, Sirota attributed the scrubbing of his account to having an \u201cautodeleter that periodically and automatically deletes tweets. I started doing this many months ago.\u201d He did not respond when asked if it was a coincidence that the tweets were deleted hours after I contacted him and the morning before he was announced as a Sanders employee. He did not respond to other questions about why he had not disclosed his role with Sanders either on Twitter or on the website Capital & Main, a left-leaning nonprofit news site.* (After the publication of this piece, Capital & Main\u2019s publisher said in a statement to The Atlantic that \u201cCapital & Main did not, and would never, knowingly allow Mr. Sirota or any reporter to use our site to advocate for or against a political candidate.\u201d) Sirota\u2019s ties to Sanders go back 20 years, to when he was Sanders\u2019s press secretary in the House of Representatives. He has always portrayed that role as a past association and nothing more, despite his continuing affinity for Sanders.\nScreenshots taken before the mass Twitter deletion preserve the role that Sirota was playing to his 125,000 followers, trying to turn the early online conversation about the 2020 primary race against other candidates, all while unofficially advising Sanders.\nHe\u2019s accused Harris of giving in to big donors and changing her stance on health care, and questioned how she will defend and define being \u201ctough on crime.\u201d He responded to Booker getting into the race by reminding people of the New Jersey senator\u2019s defense of Bain Capital, Mitt Romney\u2019s former company, in 2012, and a 2017 vote favored by the pharmaceutical industry that has become a big target for Sanders and his supporters.\nSirota has repeatedly attacked Bennet, his home-state senator from Colorado, over his management of the Denver school system, which he has said is \u201cnow ripped apart by chaos.\u201d He has also attacked Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor and a current Democratic presidential candidate, for the poor state of Colorado\u2019s roads. He has criticized both Bennet and Hickenlooper for not responding in what he thought would have been the appropriate way during a teachers\u2019 strike in Denver.\nResponding to an NBC News op-ed in January calling Biden \u201cthe Democrats\u2019 best chance to beat Trump,\u201d Sirota highlighted that the author used to work for the American Legislative Exchange Council, and wrote that Biden \u201cwas just endorsed\u201d by a former spokesperson for \u201cthe group that pushes right-wing legislation in state capitals across the country.\u201d\nReacting to a CNBC article about Gillibrand\u2019s outreach to big donors, he wrote at the beginning of February, \u201cWelcome to the oligarchy,\u201d and attacked her for the time she spent at a law firm with the tobacco company Philip Morris as a client. In another tweet, he mocked her for endorsing Representative Joe Crowley last year in his losing primary campaign against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\nHe also knocked Bloomberg for how much of his fortune he spent on a presidential campaign, and for his \u201callegedly awesome climate policies,\u201d which he contrasted by pointing out the former mayor\u2019s support for responsible fracking.\nAsked if these attacks align with the pledge for a clean and positive campaign that Sanders has made, Shakir said, \u201cI can only promise and pledge the manner in which he is going to work on this campaign is consistent with those values.\u201d\nHe said that he is sure Sirota is apologetic. \u201cAll I can say is, going forward, he is very much a team player,\u201d Shakir said.\nMeanwhile, before officially joining the Sanders campaign a little more than a week ago, Sirota promoted meetings of the campaign and the Sanders-aligned Our Revolution group.\nAmong the few people in the 2020 conversation whom he has said positive things about: Jay Inslee and Bill de Blasio. Both have appeared on his podcast.\nAnd then there\u2019s O\u2019Rourke. Sirota went after the former Texas congressman\u2019s campaign-finance and voting records. He then turned those into an op-ed on December 20 in The Guardian, writing that \u201ca new analysis of congressional votes from the non-profit news organisation Capital & Main shows that even as O\u2019Rourke represented one of the most solidly Democratic congressional districts in the United States, he has frequently voted against the majority of House Democrats in support of Republican bills and Trump administration priorities.\u201d\n\u201cThis story was reported by David Sirota of Capital & Main,\u201d a note at the end of the article read. He wrote another piece two days later, headlined \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke Is the New Obama. And That\u2019s the Last Thing We Need.\u201d**\nPushing back against those who wondered why he was tearing into another Democrat, he dismissed via Twitter \u201cthe trolls trying to de-credential me & claim I\u2019m not a \u2018real journalist.\u2019\u201d In December, he said anyone who questioned his motives \u201cillustrates something important: while Dems deride Trump\u2019s war on the press, there are a cadre of Dems who try to bully campaign finance reporters if they report facts that are inconvenient to Democratic candidates.\u201d He also tweeted that if \u201cyou are a political reporter or DC thinktanker, you see everything in front of you as a political scheme & cant fathom the idea of non-partisan issue-based missions. Electoral politics is the prism through which you view the world & so you assume everything is political.\u201d He added later that he\u2019s not engaged in \u201csome sort of secretive political conspiracy for a particular candidate.\u201d\nSirota sent a note to his own email list after the hiring announcement was made, writing, \u201cI believe journalism is an extremely important and necessary line of work, and I will miss it (and one day in the future, it is possible I may return to it).\u201d\nHis hiring has been in discussion among the top levels of Sanders\u2019s campaign since before the senator launched his bid for the presidency, according to Shakir and other sources with direct knowledge of internal discussions, but Sirota did not portray it that way.",

But as far as Donald Trump and his associates are concerned, it will be just another weekday. Even as speculation has built that <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/us/politics/william-barr-mueller-report.html\">Team Mueller was unsatisfied</a> with Attorney General Bill Barr&rsquo;s summary of the report, Trump allies remain confident&mdash;serene, even&mdash;in their belief that the fuller version will only help their case ahead of 2020.</p>\n<p>To them, Mueller&rsquo;s top-line finding of &ldquo;no collusion&rdquo; was the only finding that mattered on March 24, when Barr released his summary, and will be the only finding that matters on Thursday and beyond. According to Barr, Mueller was unable to reach a conclusion on obstruction one way or the other, meaning it&rsquo;s likely that the full report could bring to bear some unsavory details about Trump&rsquo;s conduct in office. But even that prospect doesn&rsquo;t worry those close to the president, who say that when it comes to which party might benefit the most from Mueller&rsquo;s findings in the next presidential election, they&rsquo;ve already won.</p>\n<p>Memories are short, say Trump allies, who are betting that when the general-election campaign rolls around, the Mueller report may well seem either just another murky tale in a multiyear string of controversies&mdash;the travel ban, the government shutdown, the immigration fights&mdash;or, better yet, evidence of how Washington &ldquo;elites,&rdquo; from Democrats to the media, have tried but failed to take down the president.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is going to be in the rearview mirror for most every American. The people who like the president like him warts and all. The ones who don&rsquo;t like the president? Guess what: The Mueller report is just going to reinforce their disliking the president,&rdquo; Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House communications director in 2017, told us. &ldquo;You know how quickly we move in the news cycle now. Six months from now, I don&rsquo;t see this being anything other than a distant memory.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>White House officials are also at ease. They are now convinced, for perhaps the first time in the past two years, that Mueller&rsquo;s investigation poses no political or legal threat to their boss&rsquo;s job security, not to mention their own. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine a situation where something is revealed in the report that significantly affects the two central conclusions that were reached on collusion and obstruction,&rdquo; one senior Trump-administration official said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unlikely that this will change a single vote in 2020 either way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say that administration officials will ignore the report. White House lawyers and Trump&rsquo;s outside legal team plan to mine it carefully as soon as it lands, with one group focused on the part dealing with obstruction of justice, another on collusion. They will pay special attention to Mueller&rsquo;s account of why he couldn&rsquo;t reach a conclusion on obstruction, the administration official said. That&rsquo;s one of the most tantalizing questions surrounding Mueller&rsquo;s report. Should House Democrats try to impeach Trump, they would presumably marshal whatever evidence Mueller gathered on obstruction. If Mueller concluded that the evidence wasn&rsquo;t sufficiently compelling, that could undercut the impeachment drive.</p>\n<p>As Team Trump pores over the report, surprises may be few. One of the witnesses who spent hours talking to prosecutors was Donald McGahn, the former White House counsel. McGahn was a central figure in any number of White House dramas, and he and the president weren&rsquo;t close. News reports show that McGahn <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html\">threatened to resign</a> rather than carry out Trump&rsquo;s directive to fire Mueller.</p>\n<p>But a person familiar with the Trump legal team&rsquo;s thinking said the attorneys have been debriefed on McGahn&rsquo;s testimony and aren&rsquo;t particularly worried about what he told Mueller.</p>\n<p>Emmet Flood, a White House attorney, will take the lead in giving Trump details of the report, though all the lawyers are on notice that they might be summoned to discuss the details with the president &ldquo;as needed,&rdquo; the administration official said. And Trump&rsquo;s outside lawyers&mdash;Jay Sekulow, Rudy Giuliani, and others&mdash;will quickly put together a reaction for reporters. Depending on how damaging the report is, they might also release all or parts of a written rebuttal they&rsquo;ve been preparing since long before Mueller&rsquo;s team ended its investigation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We know that the plane landed safely, with no injuries and no damage to the aircraft,&rdquo; Sekulow told us. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll find out if the landing was really smooth or a little bumpy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Yet no matter what the report reveals, even Democrats anticipate the narrative that emerged from Barr&rsquo;s summary&mdash;that Mueller cleared Trump of wrongdoing&mdash;will remain largely fixed. (Indeed, polling shows that Barr&rsquo;s summary may have given Trump a lift. A Gallup survey begun the week after Barr&rsquo;s report came out showed Trump&rsquo;s approval rating at 45 percent&mdash;up six points since March.) According to one top Democratic operative, the left&rsquo;s response to the full report is in many ways as predictable as the right&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I think it will be heavily redacted &hellip; but there will be enough to cast doubt on Barr&rsquo;s synopsis,&rdquo; this person said. &ldquo;So then Democrats will go on to fight to get the full report, and yada yada yada.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So for all the attention the Mueller report has drawn, its release won&rsquo;t change the basic calculus: Republicans and Democrats are entrenched in the same positions.</p>\n<p>Still, some Democratic strategists believe that their party shouldn&rsquo;t fight to keep the issue alive. As the Democratic primary kicks into gear, they say candidates shouldn&rsquo;t focus too heavily on the report at the expense of issues that Americans may feel are more important to their own lives.</p>\n<p>Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s 2016 presidential campaign, said that Democrats would be smart to follow a two-track approach to the Mueller report. Oversight committees should aggressively chase down an unredacted report that paints the fullest possible picture of Trump&rsquo;s actions, he said. But Democratic presidential candidates&mdash;and others on the ballot&mdash;shouldn&rsquo;t spend their time &ldquo;litigating the finer points of the Mueller report,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d be better served positioning themselves around an affirmative agenda they&rsquo;d prioritize if they get to Washington.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hundreds of pages long, the report will inevitably offer fresh insights into how Trump operates behind the scenes. Barr hinted that the press hasn&rsquo;t unearthed all of what he called &ldquo;obstruction-of-justice concerns&rdquo; that Mueller examined, and that the report shows other instances of questionable behavior on Trump&rsquo;s part.</p>\n<p>Again, though, Trump allies believe that public impressions of the report have already hardened. If the report shows Trump acting in boorish ways that don&rsquo;t rise to the level of criminal conduct, voters will be unmoved, they said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Will there be some evidence that doesn&rsquo;t reflect well on the president or members of his staff? I think that&rsquo;s very likely,&rdquo; Scaramucci said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you get a 400-page report produced in Washington where every paragraph holds the person being looked at in pristine, high regard.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>We want to hear what you think about this article. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/contact/letters/\">Submit a letter</a> to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.</p>",

                "text": "On Thursday, Robert Mueller\u2019s highly anticipated 400-page report on the Russia investigation is slated to drop. But as far as Donald Trump and his associates are concerned, it will be just another weekday. Even as speculation has built that Team Mueller was unsatisfied with Attorney General Bill Barr\u2019s summary of the report, Trump allies remain confident\u2014serene, even\u2014in their belief that the fuller version will only help their case ahead of 2020.\nTo them, Mueller\u2019s top-line finding of \u201cno collusion\u201d was the only finding that mattered on March 24, when Barr released his summary, and will be the only finding that matters on Thursday and beyond. According to Barr, Mueller was unable to reach a conclusion on obstruction one way or the other, meaning it\u2019s likely that the full report could bring to bear some unsavory details about Trump\u2019s conduct in office. But even that prospect doesn\u2019t worry those close to the president, who say that when it comes to which party might benefit the most from Mueller\u2019s findings in the next presidential election, they\u2019ve already won.\nMemories are short, say Trump allies, who are betting that when the general-election campaign rolls around, the Mueller report may well seem either just another murky tale in a multiyear string of controversies\u2014the travel ban, the government shutdown, the immigration fights\u2014or, better yet, evidence of how Washington \u201celites,\u201d from Democrats to the media, have tried but failed to take down the president.\n\u201cThis is going to be in the rearview mirror for most every American. The people who like the president like him warts and all. The ones who don\u2019t like the president? Guess what: The Mueller report is just going to reinforce their disliking the president,\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House communications director in 2017, told us. \u201cYou know how quickly we move in the news cycle now. Six months from now, I don\u2019t see this being anything other than a distant memory.\u201d\nWhite House officials are also at ease. They are now convinced, for perhaps the first time in the past two years, that Mueller\u2019s investigation poses no political or legal threat to their boss\u2019s job security, not to mention their own. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a situation where something is revealed in the report that significantly affects the two central conclusions that were reached on collusion and obstruction,\u201d one senior Trump-administration official said. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that this will change a single vote in 2020 either way.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t to say that administration officials will ignore the report. White House lawyers and Trump\u2019s outside legal team plan to mine it carefully as soon as it lands, with one group focused on the part dealing with obstruction of justice, another on collusion. They will pay special attention to Mueller\u2019s account of why he couldn\u2019t reach a conclusion on obstruction, the administration official said. That\u2019s one of the most tantalizing questions surrounding Mueller\u2019s report. Should House Democrats try to impeach Trump, they would presumably marshal whatever evidence Mueller gathered on obstruction. If Mueller concluded that the evidence wasn\u2019t sufficiently compelling, that could undercut the impeachment drive.\nAs Team Trump pores over the report, surprises may be few. One of the witnesses who spent hours talking to prosecutors was Donald McGahn, the former White House counsel. McGahn was a central figure in any number of White House dramas, and he and the president weren\u2019t close. News reports show that McGahn threatened to resign rather than carry out Trump\u2019s directive to fire Mueller.\nBut a person familiar with the Trump legal team\u2019s thinking said the attorneys have been debriefed on McGahn\u2019s testimony and aren\u2019t particularly worried about what he told Mueller.\nEmmet Flood, a White House attorney, will take the lead in giving Trump details of the report, though all the lawyers are on notice that they might be summoned to discuss the details with the president \u201cas needed,\u201d the administration official said. And Trump\u2019s outside lawyers\u2014Jay Sekulow, Rudy Giuliani, and others\u2014will quickly put together a reaction for reporters. Depending on how damaging the report is, they might also release all or parts of a written rebuttal they\u2019ve been preparing since long before Mueller\u2019s team ended its investigation.\n\u201cWe know that the plane landed safely, with no injuries and no damage to the aircraft,\u201d Sekulow told us. \u201cNow we\u2019ll find out if the landing was really smooth or a little bumpy.\u201d\nYet no matter what the report reveals, even Democrats anticipate the narrative that emerged from Barr\u2019s summary\u2014that Mueller cleared Trump of wrongdoing\u2014will remain largely fixed. (Indeed, polling shows that Barr\u2019s summary may have given Trump a lift. A Gallup survey begun the week after Barr\u2019s report came out showed Trump\u2019s approval rating at 45 percent\u2014up six points since March.) According to one top Democratic operative, the left\u2019s response to the full report is in many ways as predictable as the right\u2019s. \u201cI think it will be heavily redacted \u2026 but there will be enough to cast doubt on Barr\u2019s synopsis,\u201d this person said. \u201cSo then Democrats will go on to fight to get the full report, and yada yada yada.\u201d\nSo for all the attention the Mueller report has drawn, its release won\u2019t change the basic calculus: Republicans and Democrats are entrenched in the same positions.\nStill, some Democratic strategists believe that their party shouldn\u2019t fight to keep the issue alive. As the Democratic primary kicks into gear, they say candidates shouldn\u2019t focus too heavily on the report at the expense of issues that Americans may feel are more important to their own lives.\nBrian Fallon, a spokesman for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, said that Democrats would be smart to follow a two-track approach to the Mueller report. Oversight committees should aggressively chase down an unredacted report that paints the fullest possible picture of Trump\u2019s actions, he said. But Democratic presidential candidates\u2014and others on the ballot\u2014shouldn\u2019t spend their time \u201clitigating the finer points of the Mueller report,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d be better served positioning themselves around an affirmative agenda they\u2019d prioritize if they get to Washington.\u201d\nHundreds of pages long, the report will inevitably offer fresh insights into how Trump operates behind the scenes. Barr hinted that the press hasn\u2019t unearthed all of what he called \u201cobstruction-of-justice concerns\u201d that Mueller examined, and that the report shows other instances of questionable behavior on Trump\u2019s part.\nAgain, though, Trump allies believe that public impressions of the report have already hardened. If the report shows Trump acting in boorish ways that don\u2019t rise to the level of criminal conduct, voters will be unmoved, they said.\n\u201cWill there be some evidence that doesn\u2019t reflect well on the president or members of his staff? I think that\u2019s very likely,\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you get a 400-page report produced in Washington where every paragraph holds the person being looked at in pristine, high regard.\u201d\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

The break was sudden, global, and irreversible. It happened on a Sunday within living memory. Mick Jagger, Meryl Streep, and Caitlyn Jenner were all born before this crack in time. Vladimir Putin, Liam Neeson, and Mr. T were all born after it.</p>\n<p>That idea might soon carry the weight of scientific fact. Later this month, a committee of researchers from around the world will decide whether the Earth sprang into the Anthropocene, a new chapter of its history, in the year 1950. If accepted, this delineation will signal a new reality, that human activities, not natural processes, are now the dominant driver of change on Earth&rsquo;s surface&mdash;that carbon pollution, climate change, deforestation, factory farms, mass die-offs, and enormous road networks have made a greater imprint on the planet than any other force in the past 12,000 years.</p>\n<p>Starting next week, the committee&rsquo;s 37 members will vote on two questions. First, should the Anthropocene be added as a new epoch to <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'\" href=\"http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale\">the Geological Time Scale</a>, the standard scientific timeline of Earth&rsquo;s 4.5-billion-year history? Second, should the Anthropocene, if it does exist, commence in the middle of the 20th century?</p>\n<p><a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.evsc.virginia.edu/ruddiman-william-f/\">William Ruddiman</a>, a professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia, is extremely worried about climate change, but he nonetheless hopes the committee votes against both questions. For the past two years, he has lobbied its members to think of the Anthropocene not as a sudden upheaval, but as a gradual change, a slow transformation of the planet that began 5,000 years ago. &ldquo;Where could you possibly pick a single start date in this ever-evolving story?&rdquo; he once asked me in an email.</p>\n<p>Last week, he and 23 other researchers argued the topic at length in the scientific journal <em>Progress in Physical Geography</em>. At stake is a seemingly simple question: When did human influence over the environment reach a tipping point?</p>\n<p>For Jan Zalasiewicz, a professor of geography at the University of Leicester, the answer is clear. Zalasiewicz chairs the Anthropocene Working Group, the committee that will soon vote on the existence of the epoch.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you look at the main parameters of the Earth-system metabolism, then &hellip; things only began to change sharply and dramatically with industrialization,&rdquo; he told me. He believes that the most significant event in humanity&rsquo;s life on the planet is <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'\" href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=great+acceleration&oq=great+acceleration+&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2638j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">the Great Acceleration</a>, the period of rapid global industrialization that followed the Second World War. As factories and cars spread across the planet, as the United States and U.S.S.R. prepared for the Cold War, carbon pollution soared. So too did methane pollution, the number of extinctions and invasive species, the degree of surface-level radiation, the quantity of plastic in the ocean, and the amount of rock and soil moved around the planet.</p>\n<p>It was &ldquo;the Big Zoom,&rdquo; he said, borrowing a phrase from the journalist Andrew Revkin. There is &ldquo;nothing really comparable&rdquo; to that shift in any other period of Earth history. Even setting carbon pollution aside, he said, the spike in fertilizer use led to the largest jump in surface nitrogen levels in 2.5 billion years. Zalasiewicz hopes the committee will start the Anthropocene in the middle of the 20th century.</p>\n<p>Ruddiman isn&rsquo;t so sure. He believes that humanity&rsquo;s effect on the planet is spread throughout time and is driven primarily by agriculture. Before the year 1750, he argues, humans had already cleared so much forest as to produce 300 billion tons of carbon emissions. Since 1950, deforestation has only led to 75 billion tons of emissions.</p>\n<p>Humans remade the planet in other ways, too. About 12,000 years ago, we drove a huge swath of American mammals, including the giant ground sloth, into extinction. About 11,000 years ago, we entered into unprecedented relationships with crops and some livestock, domesticating them and taming their genome. Between 6,000 and 7,000 years ago, humans began clear-cutting forests to create new agricultural land; they may have transformed much of Europe by doing so. And by about 1,000 years ago, as humans embraced tilling and made rice paddies, they began moving more dirt and rock around the surface of the planet than is moved naturally.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to put an exact date&rdquo; on the Anthropocene, Ruddiman told me last week. &ldquo;It goes on continuously for 12,000 years. There&rsquo;s no obvious break point. Even just the invention of tilling&mdash;it&rsquo;s huge.&rdquo; For that reason, he believes that the committee shouldn&rsquo;t add a capital-A Anthropocene to the geological timeline. Instead, scientists should talk about the &ldquo;lower-a anthropocene&rdquo;&mdash;a set of profound changes wrought to Earth over the course of millennia, across many different places. They culminate in the biggest anthropocene of all: modern, human-caused climate change.</p>\n<p>It is important to say <em>modern</em>, for Ruddiman believes that humans have already shifted the climate once before. About a decade ago, he proposed what&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;early anthropocene hypothesis&rdquo;&mdash;a theory that ancient agricultural clear-cutting added so much carbon to the atmosphere that it effectively stopped Arctic glaciers from expanding more than 3,000 years ago. If not for that deforestation, then there would be an additional Greenland&rsquo;s worth of ice in the Canadian Arctic today, he said.</p>\n<p>While Ruddiman&rsquo;s hypothesis is not widely accepted, it is taken seriously by the community. And his broader skepticism of codifying a late Anthropocene is shared by several members of the working group. In a separate paper published last week, five members of the committee rejected the idea of the 1950s Anthropocene. Today&rsquo;s scientists are simply too close to the events at hand to place a division in geological time, they argue. We don&rsquo;t yet know how significantly the planet&rsquo;s climate will change in the centuries to come: Will the shift be of the same magnitude as what occurred at the end of the last Ice Age, 12,000 years ago? Will it be equal to the first time that ice seized the surface of Earth, 2.1 million years ago? Or does it signal something far larger, a cataclysm on par with the asteroid impact that ended the dinosaur-dominated Mesozoic Era, 66 million years ago? &ldquo;There is no testable way of knowing at present,&rdquo; they wrote.</p>\n<p>The five authors also point out that the last 12,000 years would be understood as a single geological instant if they had happened millions of years ago. (Indeed, it would be one of the most shocking geological moments in the whole rock record.) And they worry about the sudden divisions that a great split in 1950 would impose on geology. If the Anthropocene is adopted as a formal time division, it will mean that any process that began in 1947 and ended in 1953 would straddle two epochs.</p>\n<p>So far, the committee at large has not seemed to accept these criticisms. In another paper published last week, Zalasiewicz and 16 of his colleagues wrote that any human-induced changes prior to 1950 paled in comparison with those that came after.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The difference between before and what&rsquo;s happening now &hellip; it&rsquo;s geologically quite dramatic,&rdquo; Zalasiewicz told me. &ldquo;We hadn&rsquo;t realized that at the beginning. In 2009, I didn&rsquo;t know that the Anthropocene would be as clear and sharp as it has been. I thought it might fade away into a fuzzy gradational change.&rdquo; Instead, the committee has accumulated more and more evidence that a new epoch lurched into existence during the mid-20th century, he said.</p>\n<p>Carbon pollution, methane pollution, and world population all spiked after 1950 as they never had before, he argues. Ruddiman told me he doubted some of the committee&rsquo;s reconstructions of human population, but appreciated their &ldquo;good-faith effort to respond.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4><strong>Population, Carbon, and Methane All Spiked After 1950</strong></h4>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/Screen_Shot_2019_04_16_at_9.39.34_AM/1e0d13c2c.png\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/Screen_Shot_2019_04_16_at_9.39.34_AM/1e0d13c2c.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/Screen_Shot_2019_04_16_at_9.39.34_AM/1e0d13c2c.png\"></img></picture><figcaption>Average values of relative change to (a) global human population, (b) atmospheric CO2 concentration, and (c) CH4 concentration over the past 20,000 years.

Since then, it has caught on more broadly in culture, even though it is not a formal term in geology. (The musician Grimes is releasing <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'\" href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/grimes-announces-new-album-miss-anthropocene/\">an Anthropocene-themed album later this year</a>.)

That leaves 15 committee members unaligned in advance of the upcoming vote. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think people who served on a committee for years would be more willing to put their name on paper,&rdquo; Ruddiman said. The vote will take place electronically and continue through May.

                "text": "Here is the hypothesis: Not so long ago, the very nature of planet Earth suffered a devastating rupture. The break was sudden, global, and irreversible. It happened on a Sunday within living memory. Mick Jagger, Meryl Streep, and Caitlyn Jenner were all born before this crack in time. Vladimir Putin, Liam Neeson, and Mr. T were all born after it.\nThat idea might soon carry the weight of scientific fact. Later this month, a committee of researchers from around the world will decide whether the Earth sprang into the Anthropocene, a new chapter of its history, in the year 1950. If accepted, this delineation will signal a new reality, that human activities, not natural processes, are now the dominant driver of change on Earth\u2019s surface\u2014that carbon pollution, climate change, deforestation, factory farms, mass die-offs, and enormous road networks have made a greater imprint on the planet than any other force in the past 12,000 years.\nStarting next week, the committee\u2019s 37 members will vote on two questions. First, should the Anthropocene be added as a new epoch to the Geological Time Scale, the standard scientific timeline of Earth\u2019s 4.5-billion-year history? Second, should the Anthropocene, if it does exist, commence in the middle of the 20th century?\nWilliam Ruddiman, a professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia, is extremely worried about climate change, but he nonetheless hopes the committee votes against both questions. For the past two years, he has lobbied its members to think of the Anthropocene not as a sudden upheaval, but as a gradual change, a slow transformation of the planet that began 5,000 years ago. \u201cWhere could you possibly pick a single start date in this ever-evolving story?\u201d he once asked me in an email.\nLast week, he and 23 other researchers argued the topic at length in the scientific journal Progress in Physical Geography. At stake is a seemingly simple question: When did human influence over the environment reach a tipping point?\nFor Jan Zalasiewicz, a professor of geography at the University of Leicester, the answer is clear. Zalasiewicz chairs the Anthropocene Working Group, the committee that will soon vote on the existence of the epoch.\n\u201cIf you look at the main parameters of the Earth-system metabolism, then \u2026 things only began to change sharply and dramatically with industrialization,\u201d he told me. He believes that the most significant event in humanity\u2019s life on the planet is the Great Acceleration, the period of rapid global industrialization that followed the Second World War. As factories and cars spread across the planet, as the United States and U.S.S.R. prepared for the Cold War, carbon pollution soared. So too did methane pollution, the number of extinctions and invasive species, the degree of surface-level radiation, the quantity of plastic in the ocean, and the amount of rock and soil moved around the planet.\nIt was \u201cthe Big Zoom,\u201d he said, borrowing a phrase from the journalist Andrew Revkin. There is \u201cnothing really comparable\u201d to that shift in any other period of Earth history. Even setting carbon pollution aside, he said, the spike in fertilizer use led to the largest jump in surface nitrogen levels in 2.5 billion years. Zalasiewicz hopes the committee will start the Anthropocene in the middle of the 20th century.\nRuddiman isn\u2019t so sure. He believes that humanity\u2019s effect on the planet is spread throughout time and is driven primarily by agriculture. Before the year 1750, he argues, humans had already cleared so much forest as to produce 300 billion tons of carbon emissions. Since 1950, deforestation has only led to 75 billion tons of emissions.\nHumans remade the planet in other ways, too. About 12,000 years ago, we drove a huge swath of American mammals, including the giant ground sloth, into extinction. About 11,000 years ago, we entered into unprecedented relationships with crops and some livestock, domesticating them and taming their genome. Between 6,000 and 7,000 years ago, humans began clear-cutting forests to create new agricultural land; they may have transformed much of Europe by doing so. And by about 1,000 years ago, as humans embraced tilling and made rice paddies, they began moving more dirt and rock around the surface of the planet than is moved naturally.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to put an exact date\u201d on the Anthropocene, Ruddiman told me last week. \u201cIt goes on continuously for 12,000 years. There\u2019s no obvious break point. Even just the invention of tilling\u2014it\u2019s huge.\u201d For that reason, he believes that the committee shouldn\u2019t add a capital-A Anthropocene to the geological timeline. Instead, scientists should talk about the \u201clower-a anthropocene\u201d\u2014a set of profound changes wrought to Earth over the course of millennia, across many different places. They culminate in the biggest anthropocene of all: modern, human-caused climate change.\nIt is important to say modern, for Ruddiman believes that humans have already shifted the climate once before. About a decade ago, he proposed what\u2019s called the \u201cearly anthropocene hypothesis\u201d\u2014a theory that ancient agricultural clear-cutting added so much carbon to the atmosphere that it effectively stopped Arctic glaciers from expanding more than 3,000 years ago. If not for that deforestation, then there would be an additional Greenland\u2019s worth of ice in the Canadian Arctic today, he said.\nWhile Ruddiman\u2019s hypothesis is not widely accepted, it is taken seriously by the community. And his broader skepticism of codifying a late Anthropocene is shared by several members of the working group. In a separate paper published last week, five members of the committee rejected the idea of the 1950s Anthropocene. Today\u2019s scientists are simply too close to the events at hand to place a division in geological time, they argue. We don\u2019t yet know how significantly the planet\u2019s climate will change in the centuries to come: Will the shift be of the same magnitude as what occurred at the end of the last Ice Age, 12,000 years ago? Will it be equal to the first time that ice seized the surface of Earth, 2.1 million years ago? Or does it signal something far larger, a cataclysm on par with the asteroid impact that ended the dinosaur-dominated Mesozoic Era, 66 million years ago? \u201cThere is no testable way of knowing at present,\u201d they wrote.\nThe five authors also point out that the last 12,000 years would be understood as a single geological instant if they had happened millions of years ago. (Indeed, it would be one of the most shocking geological moments in the whole rock record.) And they worry about the sudden divisions that a great split in 1950 would impose on geology. If the Anthropocene is adopted as a formal time division, it will mean that any process that began in 1947 and ended in 1953 would straddle two epochs.\nSo far, the committee at large has not seemed to accept these criticisms. In another paper published last week, Zalasiewicz and 16 of his colleagues wrote that any human-induced changes prior to 1950 paled in comparison with those that came after.\n\u201cThe difference between before and what\u2019s happening now \u2026 it\u2019s geologically quite dramatic,\u201d Zalasiewicz told me. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t realized that at the beginning. In 2009, I didn\u2019t know that the Anthropocene would be as clear and sharp as it has been. I thought it might fade away into a fuzzy gradational change.\u201d Instead, the committee has accumulated more and more evidence that a new epoch lurched into existence during the mid-20th century, he said.\nCarbon pollution, methane pollution, and world population all spiked after 1950 as they never had before, he argues. Ruddiman told me he doubted some of the committee\u2019s reconstructions of human population, but appreciated their \u201cgood-faith effort to respond.\u201d\nPopulation, Carbon, and Methane All Spiked After 1950\nThe idea of the Anthropocene was first proposed by the Nobel-winning chemist Paul Crutzen in 2000. Since then, it has caught on more broadly in culture, even though it is not a formal term in geology. (The musician Grimes is releasing an Anthropocene-themed album later this year.) But it could soon have its day: If the working group accepts its existence, that will clear the way for the International Commission on Stratigraphy and the International Union of Geological Sciences to accept it in full.\nOf the working group\u2019s 37 members, 17 members signed their name to Zalasiewicz\u2019s paper, and only five signed their name to the more skeptical review. That leaves 15 committee members unaligned in advance of the upcoming vote. \u201cYou\u2019d think people who served on a committee for years would be more willing to put their name on paper,\u201d Ruddiman said. The vote will take place electronically and continue through May. If it succeeds, then the committee will busy itself with the next task: finding evidence in the rock record of the precise moment that humanity pushed Earth into a bewildering new era.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

She tried to slide her long, flexible tongue into my mouth, and when that failed, an unguarded nostril.</p>\n<p>This wolf lives with four of her siblings on five acres of remote spruce forest in northern Norway, well above the Arctic Circle. Though she hunts the small animals that find their way through the high steel fence that encloses her world, she mainly eats carcasses supplied by her human keepers. Through the long winter twilights and summer days, she fights with her pack mates; she stretches, yawns, and rolls on her belly; she sits on her haunches and stares across the valley. But unlike free-roaming wolves, she has no reflexive fear of humans. When she was born in captivity five years ago, her keepers named her Frigg, after the Norse goddess, and in their care she has learned that most humans are simply objects of curiosity, sporadically available for inspection.</p>\n<p>Which is not to say that Frigg is tame. Wolves long accustomed to humans can still be frightened by unfamiliar behaviors&mdash;and in a confined space, they may feel cornered and attack. Even when at ease, wolves can be dangerous at close range, and what starts as a playful lick can end in a painful nip. Before entering the wolves&rsquo; enclosure, I was told not to make sudden movements or actively approach the animals. I was told to allow them to advance and retreat as they pleased; to speak quietly, if at all; and to kneel, not sit, so that if necessary I could make a hasty escape through the nearby gate. I was instructed to take off my earrings, my hair clip, and any wool clothing, lest I smell like a sheep. I was warned not to wear heavy scents, and told that synthetic polar fleece is, for reasons not entirely understood, perilously exciting to wolves. Only with hesitation were my leather boots permitted.</p>\n<p>This place is called Polar Park, and though visitors can see many species here&mdash;lynx, moose, bears, reindeer&mdash;what draws them from all over Europe and beyond are the wolves. Wolves were trapped, shot, and chased out of much of Europe long ago, and a lot of people, it seems, are willing to pay a lot of money to watch wolves at play in a European forest.</p>\n<aside data-omni-click=\"r'article',r' ',d,r'related',#data-omni-index,@data-article-id\"> <figure><a data-article-id=\"2640325\" data-omni-click=\"inherit\" data-omni-index=\"0\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/09/norway-progress-party-populism-immigration/539535/\"><img alt=\"Siv Jensen walks out surrounded by reporters with microphones.\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/09/RTX3FRUL/thumb_wide_medium.jpg?1522773824\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/09/norway-progress-party-populism-immigration/539535/\">What Right-Wing Populists Look Like in Norway</a></figcaption></figure> </aside>\n<p>I had, and still have, mixed feelings about these wolves&rsquo; captivity, their training, and the resources required to get near them. I&rsquo;d heard and seen free-roaming wolves in the past&mdash;closer to home, in Yellowstone National Park&mdash;and I had wondered whether an encounter with captive wolves, even a hands-on one, could compare. Yet once inside the enclosure, I was overwhelmed by the immediacy of the animals. I don&rsquo;t cry easily, but when Frigg butted her heavy body against my chest, vying for attention as her pack mate made her own attempt to spiral her tongue into my nasal cavity, I choked up.</p>\n<p>Though Polar Park might be one of the few places in the world where it&rsquo;s possible to pet a wolf in relative safety, it&rsquo;s no longer one of the only places in Europe where it&rsquo;s possible to see a wolf. As organized persecution of wolves has eased, and as people continue to leave the European countryside for cities, wolves and other predators are wandering back to the countries that once exterminated them. Wolves from surviving populations in Italy crossed the Alps into southern France in the 1990s, and wolves from Poland took up residence in eastern Germany a few years later. In 2011, a Dutch mortician photographed a wolf crossing a road in the eastern Netherlands&mdash;the first verified sighting in the country in well over a century. In 2012, Danish officials confirmed their country&rsquo;s first wolf sighting in 200 years, and last spring, researchers filmed a litter of wolf pups at play on the Danish mainland. Wolves have returned to the Scandinavian peninsula, too, and today, more than 400 wolves live in the unfenced forests of Sweden and Norway.</p>\n<p>Europe is now home to an estimated 12,000 wolves, 17,000 bears, and 9,000 lynx, and wolf sightings have been documented in every country on the European mainland. Large predators provoke powerful emotions, and in Norway, where captive wolves are a beloved and lucrative tourist attraction, humans have greeted the returning wolves with both great joy and exceptionally furious resistance. The resulting conflict is testing humans&rsquo; ability to coexist with our fellow predators&mdash;and, along the way, our ability to coexist with one another.</p>\n<p>More than 500 miles south of Polar Park, well beyond the easternmost fingertips of the coastal fjords, the broad glacial valleys of inland Norway are thinly populated and thickly forested. Along the Norway-Sweden border, the high plateaus are speckled with lichen, and in the fall, yellowing birch leaves glow in the low-angle light, buttery flames against the gray clouds.</p>\n<p>Petter Wabakken has lived in this area for 40 years, ever since he moved here with his young family in the fall of 1978. Tall, thin, and scruffy-haired, he is now, somewhat to his chagrin, the public face of wolf recovery in Norway. Back in 1978, though, he was a student at the University of Oslo, hired by the Norwegian government to look into a spate of reported wolf sightings along the border. The last wolf bounty in Norway had been paid more than a decade earlier, and for nearly a century there had been no more than a handful of wolves in southern Norway. Most experts dismissed the reports from southeastern Norway and southwestern Sweden as sightings of &ldquo;unidentified pet animals,&rdquo; and Wabakken was not expected to find much of interest.</p>\n<p>Wabakken, however, was not intimidated by scientific authority: While still in high school, he&rsquo;d published a paper questioning the official counts of threatened bird species in Norway. &ldquo;When things are described in black-and-white terms, then I get very curious,&rdquo; he told me when I met with him at the Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, the small technical college where he teaches.</p>\n<p>Wabakken had heard and read enough about the local sightings to suspect that at least some were accurate, but there was no obvious way to confirm them. DNA testing of hair and scat was not yet possible; motion-sensitive camera &ldquo;traps&rdquo; were not yet widely available; individual tracks in the snow could not be confidently distinguished from the tracks of dogs or wolf-dog hybrids. But Wabakken had time, and he had patience. Whenever he found a set of canine tracks in the snow, he followed it on skis&mdash;sometimes for hundreds of miles and weeks at a time. He hypothesized that wolves, which, unlike domestic dogs, had no reliable source of food or shelter, would behave in ways that allowed them to save energy. He noticed that some of the animals he was tracking sought out shallower or more compacted snow, sticking closely to riverbanks, forest roads, and tire tracks. Some even used old moose prints to hopscotch over the landscape, stretching from one track to the next without dropping into the snow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see a dog move its paws so efficiently and elegantly,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>After four winters of work, Wabakken concluded that between three and five wolves had taken up residence in Norway, but he didn&rsquo;t have definitive proof. And because he had purposely kept his distance from the animals he tracked&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t want to influence their behavior&mdash;he had not yet laid eyes on a Norwegian wolf.</p>\n<p>In 1982, Wabakken was invited to present his findings at an international mammal conference in Helsinki. As a young, unproven researcher, he expected that only a handful of people would listen to his report. Due to a scheduling mix-up, however, his talk was squeezed between presentations by two eminent scientists, and he spoke to a captive audience of hundreds. Wabakken won over the experts who heard him, and their endorsement convinced Scandinavian managers that wolves were back in Norway. The following year, a litter of wolf pups was spotted on the Norway-Sweden border, and for the first time in nearly a century, the peninsula had a documented breeding population of wolves.</p>\n<p>For a while, the public reaction was muted. Few managers believed that the fledgling binational population would survive, and with good reason; to get to Sweden and Norway from Finland or Russia, which have substantial wolf populations, a wolf must either survive a long and dangerous journey through the S&aacute;mi reindeer-herding districts of northern Scandinavia, where legal protection for wolves is relatively weak, or cross at least 90 miles of unpredictable Baltic sea ice. But by 1990, at least one more wolf had managed the trip, and the small band founded a thriving population. By 2002, as many as a hundred wolves in eight family packs were in southern Sweden and Norway. Last winter, researchers counted 305 wolves in Sweden and 94 in Norway, living in a total of 41 packs. Lynx, bears, and wolverines have rebounded, too.</p>\n<p>As the wolf population expanded, resistance to it grew. During the decades in which wolves and other predators had been scarce or absent, Norwegian farmers had begun allowing their sheep to scatter in the mountains each summer, believing that dispersed animals could make the most of the sparse vegetation; they even developed breeds known for their disinterest in herding. Norwegian moose hunters, who traditionally work with elkhounds on leashes, had begun to train their dogs to run loose in the forest after quarries. &ldquo;The return of the wolves represented a change in a system that had taken many, many years to build up,&rdquo; says John Linnell of the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research. Polls consistently showed that the majority of Norwegians supported wolf recovery, but as the sheep and dog casualties mounted, the pitch and volume of the complaints increased.</p>\n<p>Wabakken recognized that the wolves&rsquo; survival depended on their human neighbors&rsquo; ability to cooperate across borders: Sweden and Norway, despite their proximity and linguistic similarities, are divided by history, culture, and, most recently, the boundary of the European Union (Norwegian voters, famously, rejected EU membership twice, first in 1972 and again in 1994). While Sweden is bound by the environmental regulations of the EU, Norway answers primarily to its own national laws and to the Bern Convention, a wildlife-protection treaty signed by all European countries; the practical result is that Sweden is required to accommodate many more wolves than its neighbor.</p>\n<p>To ensure that scientists, at least, treated the countries&rsquo; shared wolf population as a single unit, Wabakken co-founded SKANDULV, a Swedish-Norwegian wolf-research project, in 1998. Over the past two decades, Wabakken, his colleague Barbara Zimmerman, and their collaborators in Sweden and Norway have monitored the growth of the population, tracked the movements of radio-collared wolves, and conducted genetic studies so extensive that they can describe the family tree of every wolf on the peninsula.</p>\n<p>Yet this heavy investment of time and money&mdash;by both countries&mdash;has done little to reduce public opposition to wolf recovery in rural Norway. Though the Scandinavian wolf population remains among the smallest in Europe, the political divide over the animals is at least as deep and stubborn as anywhere on the continent.</p>\n<p>To anyone familiar with the rural United States, rural Norway is almost disconcertingly prosperous. On an early evening in mid-September of last year, in the eastern Norwegian town of Elverum&mdash;a winding half-hour drive south of Wabakken&rsquo;s college campus&mdash;teenagers chased soccer balls across vivid green fields, and Teslas purred past the neat storefronts that line the wide main street. On the outskirts of town, in the lingering autumn sunlight, nearly 300 people stood outside the Norwegian Forest Museum, waiting to be let through the front doors. They filed into the museum&rsquo;s spacious atrium, helped themselves to black coffee and sweet bread, and settled into chairs arranged in careful rows. The only suggestion that this gathering was anything other than a well-attended community meeting were the two uniformed police officers stationed discreetly in the atrium&rsquo;s balcony.</p>\n<p>Though wolves were the ostensible subject of the meeting, they were present only in effigy, and only on the distant edges of the crowd. In the museum foyer, a taxidermied wolf eyed arriving visitors. Upstairs, in a darkened gallery, another stood in a too-small glass case, head thrown high and teeth bared as if about to howl.</p>\n<p>The September meeting&rsquo;s organizer was Gunnar Gundersen, a former member of Parliament who swam the 400-meter medley in the 1976 Olympics in Montreal and still cuts a powerful figure at the podium. A wealthy private-forest owner, he works for a national timber cooperative and heads a regional alliance of forestry and farming organizations. The meeting, he told me later, was intended to &ldquo;put a bit of pressure&rdquo; on the national environment ministry. For most of three hours, as the deputy environment minister hunched uncomfortably at a long table in the front of the room, a succession of invited speakers endeavored to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>While the translator I was working with whispered subtitles into my ear, a local hunter reported that his beloved elkhound had been killed by a wolf&mdash;then got some laughs by poking fun at the absent environment minister Ola Elvestuen, known for both his sympathy for wolves and his dandified good looks. Diminutive, white-haired Gunnar Gl&ouml;ersen, a representative from the Swedish Hunters Association, warned that if the government didn&rsquo;t permit more wolf hunting in Norway, hunters would take matters into their own hands and start poaching the animals.</p>\n<p>Several area farmers said that the continued killing of livestock by wolves threatened their livelihood. More than 2,600 sheep and lambs were documented by government officials as having been killed by wolves in 2018&mdash;Norway&rsquo;s agricultural daily often led with bloody photos of disemboweled lambs&mdash;and while those casualties represent a small fraction of the roughly 2 million sheep and lambs that graze freely in the forest each summer, some farmers were hit disproportionately hard. (The government compensates farmers for documented losses of sheep to wolves, but as many farmers point out, the payments don&rsquo;t cover the costs of extra shepherds and other indirect impacts to their businesses.)</p>\n<p>The evening&rsquo;s argument revolved around the number of wolf packs permitted to live in Norway. In late 2016, a resolution by the Norwegian Parliament set a target of &ldquo;four to six&rdquo; litters in the binational population each year, with at least three born to packs living entirely within Norwegian borders. Regional authorities were allowed to permit hunters to &ldquo;cull&rdquo; or shoot additional animals, and a total of 30 wolves were legally shot by private or state-employed hunters between June of 2017 and March of 2018. Another 20 have been shot since June of 2018. Wolf numbers still exceed the target set by Parliament, however, and most of those who spoke at the meeting&mdash;including several irate members of Parliament&mdash;wanted the national environment ministry to allow more hunting and fewer wolves.</p>\n<p>Elvestuen, however, has been reluctant to expand the wolf hunt. In contrast to the parliamentary agreement, both Norway&rsquo;s national environmental law and the international Bern Convention state that no species can be hunted until its populations are self-sustaining within national borders&mdash;which some legal scholars interpret to mean that more wolf packs should be allowed to survive and reproduce in Norway. The matter is currently in court, with conservation groups and agricultural and hunting organizations lining up on opposing sides.</p>\n<p>The disagreement runs far deeper than numbers. For Norway, which declared its independence from Sweden just over a century ago and was occupied and nearly starved out by German forces during World War II, domestic food production is a matter of both national security and national pride. In recent decades, the government has gone to great lengths to keep farmers and rural communities solvent. (Norwegian voters opposed EU membership partly because they feared it would lead to cuts in state agricultural subsidies, which currently make up about 60 percent of farmers&rsquo; gross income.) But farming is and always has been a marginal enterprise in cold, soil-poor Norway, and despite the generous government support, more than half of the country&rsquo;s farmers work second jobs.</p>\n<p>When sheep farmers say that wolves are threatening their livelihood, or hunters say their traditions are endangered, they&rsquo;re rarely talking about their individual survival: Norway&rsquo;s extensive, tax-supported welfare state guarantees every Norwegian a basic level of economic and social security. What most mean, fundamentally, is that wolves look like yet another threat to Norway&rsquo;s hard-won independence.</p>\n<p>Such fears surfaced throughout the meeting, and toward the end of the evening, when the floor was opened to public comment, they were echoed by many in the mostly older, predominantly male, and almost entirely white audience. But the room held other fears, too. &ldquo;My family is going to tell me to shut up,&rdquo; said a young, dark-haired woman who declined to identify herself. &ldquo;But not everyone in Elverum is against wolves.&rdquo; The crowd muttered, and there was scattered applause.</p>\n<p>The next speaker, Kari Wenche Fossum, wore her long gray hair in a loose twist, and surveyed the audience through round glasses. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to say something you don&rsquo;t want to hear about being outside, about feeling safe,&rdquo; she said calmly. Because of her support for wolves and other predators, she continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been physically threatened, I&rsquo;ve been injured twice. I want to encourage everyone to think about this. It&rsquo;s not just you guys who are suffering.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The relationship between Norwegian humans and Norwegian wolves is, in some ways, distinctive. Because of Norway&rsquo;s investment in rural life, its countryside is more populated than Sweden&rsquo;s, and Norwegian sheep farmers have hung on while most of their Swedish counterparts have simply moved out of wolf habitat. And some Norwegian politicians have found that it is both possible and politically convenient to keep compensating farmers and hunters for wolf damage, all the while promising a radical reduction in wolf numbers&mdash;a strategy that gives their constituents little incentive to adapt.</p>\n<p>Public attitudes toward wolves in Norway, and in northern Europe as a whole, also seem to be less tolerant than attitudes in southern and eastern Europe, where some farmers have never known a world without wolves. There, defensive practices such as keeping sheep in tighter, more closely supervised herds are considered routine. &ldquo;Wolves might be a pain, you might not like them, but eventually, there is not much sense in protesting against them,&rdquo; says the researcher Nathan Ranc, who studies carnivores in Italy, France, and elsewhere. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re like a storm or an avalanche. They&rsquo;re there, and it&rsquo;s part of the job to deal with them.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><picture><img alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/wolf3/2e32ce5a8.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/wolf3/2e32ce5a8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/wolf3/2e32ce5a8.jpg\"></img></picture><figcaption>Lidia Tomashevskaya</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At the same time, what&rsquo;s happened to the public discussion about wolves in Norway in recent years is exactly what&rsquo;s happened to discussions of all kinds, all over the world: It has become more and more polarized, sometimes violently so. In 2009, an Elverum-area resident named Tore Hauge was so outraged by the illegal killing of a local wolf that he personally offered a reward of 50,000 Norwegian kroner&mdash;about $8,000 at the time&mdash;for information leading to the culprit. After his offer appeared in the newspaper, garbage was dumped in his driveway, and his outbuildings and fences were vandalized. One night, when he was out of town, his wife awoke to a loud buzzing noise and realized that a group of people had encircled the house and were marching around it, waving chain saws. Wenche Fossum, who spoke at the Elverum meeting, told me that she has been the target of threats for more than a decade.</p>\n<p>Critics of the government&rsquo;s wolf policy have fewer and less extreme stories of harassment, but they feel the sharp edges of polarization, too. Three herding-cooperative leaders told me that every time they appear on television to talk about their problems with wolves, they are blasted with vicious texts and calls from wolf supporters.</p>\n<p>The Norwegian sociologist Ketil Skogen, who has studied the wolf controversy for two decades, says that its deepest divisions are between rural and urban Norwegians. Since World War II, in Norway and the rest of the developed world, the growth of the urban middle class&mdash;both in numbers and political and cultural influence&mdash;has fostered a sense of inferiority in rural communities. Many rural people feel, not without reason, that their practical knowledge and experience are dismissed by more formally trained urban &ldquo;experts,&rdquo; and some have responded to perceived and real disrespect with a deep skepticism of science and scientific authority. These urban-rural resentments, Skogen has found, can obscure even vast class differences, creating political alliances between large rural landowners such as Gundersen and working-class hunters and farmers.</p>\n<p>Gundersen has worked with farmers&rsquo; and landowners&rsquo; groups to mobilize this alliance, and this past January, they drew an estimated 7,000 protesters to a torchlight parade in Oslo. Supporters of wolf recovery have also organized large protests, with several thousand people turning out for demonstrations across the country this winter. <em>Vi er vikinger, ikke veikinger</em>, (We are Vikings, not weaklings), read one pro-wolf demonstrator&rsquo;s sign.</p>\n<p>In Norway, like everywhere else, these divides are deepened by social media. During my week of conversations in rural Norway&mdash;in farmyards, in offices, and over teatime waffles in cozy kitchens&mdash;I heard repeatedly that the nastiest arguments about wolves take place on Facebook. Social media have bred conspiracy theories, too, with many wolf opponents insisting, for instance, that the wolves were secretly trucked into Scandinavia and released. (There are many variations on this rumor, all fanciful extrapolations of a real but stillborn Swedish proposal to reintroduce wolves in the 1970s.) The theory is so persistent that a group of landowners in eastern Norway commissioned a second set of wolf DNA analyses, separate from those already conducted by SKANDULV, in hopes that the results would suggest that the animals were descended from captives or came from far outside the region. Wolf opponents have also convinced the Norwegian government to sponsor two additional studies. But none has found any evidence of deliberate reintroduction.</p>\n<p>Even for a visitor, the polarization can be exhausting&mdash;and frustrating, for the stereotypes that help maintain it usually collapse in conversation. One of the most passionate wolf opponents I spoke with, a sheep farmer and the leader of a local herding cooperative, grew up outside Oslo and took up farming only after pursuing a career in the city. Marte Conradi of the World Wildlife Fund, whom I met with in a swank coffee bar at the Oslo airport as she was returning from a conference on European predators, grew up in a tiny town in eastern Norway and worked for several years as a county-level wildlife manager. Tore Hauge, who put up the reward for the wolf poacher, grew up in Rena, near Elverum, and before his recent retirement made a living mining coal and building highway tunnels. And not many wolf opponents are more skeptical of scientific authority than their sworn enemy Petter Wabakken.</p>\n<p>Even those who think wolves have no place in Norway insisted to me that they have no problem with wolves in general, and many spoke of them with admiration. This might have been what they thought I wanted to hear, but I heard it expressed so many times, and in such detail, that I came to believe it was at least partly sincere. J&oslash;rn Stener, a hunting guide and a fierce critic of the government&rsquo;s handling of the wolf recovery, sounded almost reverent when he recalled the first of his many encounters with wolves in the woods. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re smart, they&rsquo;re adaptable&mdash;they&rsquo;re amazing animals,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Though politics may or may not allow the Scandinavian wolf population to expand in eastern Norway, Norwegian wolves are almost certainly here to stay. &ldquo;You can sit and dream about the time when we didn&rsquo;t have large carnivores,&rdquo; Wabakken said. &ldquo;But that dream is over.&rdquo; Even if resident wolves were to be killed or driven out, as they were in previous centuries, young wolves born to Swedish packs would soon wander over the border to take their place. Eventually, farmers in wolf habitat will have to adjust: They will have to switch from raising sheep to raising cows, which are less vulnerable to wolf predation, or follow the lead of farmers such as Morten and Linda Ulvedalen, who recently bought a farmstead inside the wolf-management zone.</p>\n<p>Morten Ulvedalen is the CEO of a specialty construction-supply company in Oslo, and the couple was able to afford enough land to both keep their sheep enclosed in the summer and grow grass for winter feed (many sheep farmers point out that they need to graze their animals in the mountains in the summer in order to use their pasture to grow feed). With the help of a government grant, they were also able to afford a burly electric fence from New Zealand, and their sheep now graze placidly within it. Linda Ulvedalen, who breeds sheep, is especially interested in reviving older breeds that are less likely to scatter in the woods. Though their surname translates to &ldquo;Wolf Valley,&rdquo; neither of the Ulvedalens is particularly happy about the expansion of the wolf population, and when I visited their farm, Morten Ulvedalen was quick to point out that government grants don&rsquo;t cover the full cost of their adaptations. Such practical measures, however, give livestock the best chance at coexisting with wolves.</p>\n<p>Larger pastures and stronger fences don&rsquo;t heal the deeper divide over wolf recovery, though. The first step toward doing that, says John Odden, a predator researcher with the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, is for opposing groups to agree on a shared set of facts. Odden uses camera traps to gather data on predator populations, and about five years ago he began to set up cameras around a community where government estimates of lynx numbers, and the consequent limits on lynx hunting, had been met with great skepticism. Odden, who grew up in the countryside not far from Elverum, decided to involve the community in his project, convincing local hunters to advise him on the placement of the cameras and help him collect the camera data cards. Some hunters got involved because they hoped to prove the government wrong; others just wanted to geek out about the fancy cameras. But one participant, Jan Erik Olbergsveen, says that those who took part in the data collection gained more confidence in its accuracy, and skepticism faded.</p>\n<p>Odden has since organized a similar project to track wolf movements near communities in eastern Norway, and while wolves are much more controversial and politically complex than lynx, he has once again enlisted locals to help place and check the cameras. Some of the angriest anti-wolf voices at the Elverum meeting, in fact, belonged to his volunteer data collectors.</p>\n<p>The reasons for opposing wolf recovery in Norway, as in most of the rest of the world, are pretty straightforward: inconvenience, cost, fear of change, fear of fangs. The reasons for championing wolves&mdash;for going to court on their behalf, for inviting anger and worse by speaking up for their protection, for spending excruciating amounts of money visiting the captive pack at Polar Park&mdash;are harder to pin down.</p>\n<p>In the United States, supporters of wolf reintroduction and recovery often point to the importance of large predators in ecosystems, especially to the measurable changes in the flora and fauna of Yellowstone National Park since the return of wolves. But in Europe, where most ecosystems are highly human-dominated, few wolf supporters expect wolf restoration to lead to a broader recovery of ecological processes. Some value wolves as symbols of wildness, or nature, or the limits of human influence, but most make another argument for wolf recovery: They say that wolves have a right (up to a point) to survive and repopulate the places where their kind once lived, and that humans have a duty (up to a point) to accommodate them.</p>\n<p>The idea that humans should accommodate other large predators is nothing new, and it&rsquo;s far from exclusively urban. In 1893, Swedish authorities ended a long-standing bounty on brown bears because they realized that the country&rsquo;s bear population was about to go extinct. &ldquo;It is a matter of honor for our country that this interesting animal be protected from complete extermination,&rdquo; the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences stated in 1905. Concern about the extinction of other species&mdash;useful to humans and not&mdash;was by that time widespread throughout North America and Europe. Since then, measures to protect other species have been almost constantly challenged, but the general notion of species survival and recovery as a good thing has persisted worldwide.</p>\n<p>Even opponents of wolf expansion in Norway indirectly acknowledge the existence of these rights and duties: One reason for the longevity of the clandestine-reintroduction conspiracy theory, for example, is that reintroduced wolves are seen as having a much lesser claim to the Norwegian countryside than animals that returned on their own, and would therefore be politically easier to drive out. Even the complaint that &ldquo;wolves have more rights than we do,&rdquo; often heard in eastern Norway, implies that both parties have at least some rights.</p>\n<p>The trouble with wolves, of course, is that their pursuit of survival collides with ours. While some species demand little of people in order to survive, large, free-roaming predators can require humans to change their habits, their livelihood, and even their place in the food chain. Norwegians, who live in one of the wealthiest and best-educated countries in the world, have an opportunity to reduce these conflicts: to hack through the accumulated mistrust and resentment, identify the genuine burdens that accompany meaningful predator recovery, and figure out, as a society, how to share those burdens more equitably. If they can do that, they will have taken a step toward solving one of the wickedest problems in conservation. If they can&rsquo;t, conservation will remain a job that gets done when convenient&mdash;and rarely otherwise.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If we can conserve predators, we can conserve everything,&rdquo; says Guillaume Chapron, a wildlife researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. &ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t conserve predators, it doesn&rsquo;t look good.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Toward the end of my visit to Polar Park, I asked Stig Sletten, who had accompanied our small group into the wolf enclosure, whether he had time to talk. Sletten, the park&rsquo;s head animal keeper, was clearly reluctant to be interviewed, but after disappearing for several hours to finish what he said were some much-needed repairs to the musk-ox shelter, he consented to a conversation.</p>\n<p>Polar Park, which was dreamed up in a bar by a group of locals hoping to bring more tourists to the area, opened in 1994 and is now supported primarily by entrance fees and corporate sponsorships. Sletten, who grew up nearby, was one of the park&rsquo;s first employees, and after more than a decade in the Norwegian military, he returned to the park full-time in 2008. Soft-spoken, with white hair that contrasts with his unlined face, Sletten is as alert and wary as a wolf, noticing everything but giving little away. He&rsquo;s aware of the resemblance, and said it serves him well inside the enclosure: &ldquo;I do have to sniff around a bit, notice what people are feeling and thinking, whether someone&rsquo;s nervous,&rdquo; he said, raising his pointer fingers above his temples to resemble ears.</p>\n<p>When I asked him what he hopes people will take from the experience, he turned serious. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to force anyone to like it or not like it,&rdquo; he said. Many visitors, like me, cry when the wolves approach them. Some cry when the keepers judge them too small or frail to enter the enclosure safely. Some brag to their friends and family that they have a special way with animals, and are embarrassed when the wolves ignore them. Some are preoccupied with their cameras. And some are scared, which doesn&rsquo;t bother Sletten. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to meet a predator&mdash;they&rsquo;re going to meet a wolf. It&rsquo;s okay that they&rsquo;re scared, maybe even a good thing,&rdquo; he said. Far more dangerous, he added, would be to have no fear at all.</p>\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t especially afraid in the enclosure, though maybe I should have been; as much as the wolves look, behave, and even smell like large dogs, they can turn on one another with shocking speed, snapping and growling with fleeting but genuine menace. With humans, however, they are simply nosy. They placidly investigated our small group, then loped off, then returned, coming and going for about an hour.

                "text": "The day was cold, gray, and rainy, and the wolf smelled exactly like a wet dog. I sat on my heels, my shoulders just a few inches higher than hers, and hesitantly scratched her belly, her thick, black-tipped gray fur soft and greasy between my fingers. She nosed at my face, bumping my chin and lapping my cheeks. She tried to slide her long, flexible tongue into my mouth, and when that failed, an unguarded nostril.\nThis wolf lives with four of her siblings on five acres of remote spruce forest in northern Norway, well above the Arctic Circle. Though she hunts the small animals that find their way through the high steel fence that encloses her world, she mainly eats carcasses supplied by her human keepers. Through the long winter twilights and summer days, she fights with her pack mates; she stretches, yawns, and rolls on her belly; she sits on her haunches and stares across the valley. But unlike free-roaming wolves, she has no reflexive fear of humans. When she was born in captivity five years ago, her keepers named her Frigg, after the Norse goddess, and in their care she has learned that most humans are simply objects of curiosity, sporadically available for inspection.\nWhich is not to say that Frigg is tame. Wolves long accustomed to humans can still be frightened by unfamiliar behaviors\u2014and in a confined space, they may feel cornered and attack. Even when at ease, wolves can be dangerous at close range, and what starts as a playful lick can end in a painful nip. Before entering the wolves\u2019 enclosure, I was told not to make sudden movements or actively approach the animals. I was told to allow them to advance and retreat as they pleased; to speak quietly, if at all; and to kneel, not sit, so that if necessary I could make a hasty escape through the nearby gate. I was instructed to take off my earrings, my hair clip, and any wool clothing, lest I smell like a sheep. I was warned not to wear heavy scents, and told that synthetic polar fleece is, for reasons not entirely understood, perilously exciting to wolves. Only with hesitation were my leather boots permitted.\nThis place is called Polar Park, and though visitors can see many species here\u2014lynx, moose, bears, reindeer\u2014what draws them from all over Europe and beyond are the wolves. Wolves were trapped, shot, and chased out of much of Europe long ago, and a lot of people, it seems, are willing to pay a lot of money to watch wolves at play in a European forest.\nI had, and still have, mixed feelings about these wolves\u2019 captivity, their training, and the resources required to get near them. I\u2019d heard and seen free-roaming wolves in the past\u2014closer to home, in Yellowstone National Park\u2014and I had wondered whether an encounter with captive wolves, even a hands-on one, could compare. Yet once inside the enclosure, I was overwhelmed by the immediacy of the animals. I don\u2019t cry easily, but when Frigg butted her heavy body against my chest, vying for attention as her pack mate made her own attempt to spiral her tongue into my nasal cavity, I choked up.\nThough Polar Park might be one of the few places in the world where it\u2019s possible to pet a wolf in relative safety, it\u2019s no longer one of the only places in Europe where it\u2019s possible to see a wolf. As organized persecution of wolves has eased, and as people continue to leave the European countryside for cities, wolves and other predators are wandering back to the countries that once exterminated them. Wolves from surviving populations in Italy crossed the Alps into southern France in the 1990s, and wolves from Poland took up residence in eastern Germany a few years later. In 2011, a Dutch mortician photographed a wolf crossing a road in the eastern Netherlands\u2014the first verified sighting in the country in well over a century. In 2012, Danish officials confirmed their country\u2019s first wolf sighting in 200 years, and last spring, researchers filmed a litter of wolf pups at play on the Danish mainland. Wolves have returned to the Scandinavian peninsula, too, and today, more than 400 wolves live in the unfenced forests of Sweden and Norway.\nEurope is now home to an estimated 12,000 wolves, 17,000 bears, and 9,000 lynx, and wolf sightings have been documented in every country on the European mainland. Large predators provoke powerful emotions, and in Norway, where captive wolves are a beloved and lucrative tourist attraction, humans have greeted the returning wolves with both great joy and exceptionally furious resistance. The resulting conflict is testing humans\u2019 ability to coexist with our fellow predators\u2014and, along the way, our ability to coexist with one another.\nMore than 500 miles south of Polar Park, well beyond the easternmost fingertips of the coastal fjords, the broad glacial valleys of inland Norway are thinly populated and thickly forested. Along the Norway-Sweden border, the high plateaus are speckled with lichen, and in the fall, yellowing birch leaves glow in the low-angle light, buttery flames against the gray clouds.\nPetter Wabakken has lived in this area for 40 years, ever since he moved here with his young family in the fall of 1978. Tall, thin, and scruffy-haired, he is now, somewhat to his chagrin, the public face of wolf recovery in Norway. Back in 1978, though, he was a student at the University of Oslo, hired by the Norwegian government to look into a spate of reported wolf sightings along the border. The last wolf bounty in Norway had been paid more than a decade earlier, and for nearly a century there had been no more than a handful of wolves in southern Norway. Most experts dismissed the reports from southeastern Norway and southwestern Sweden as sightings of \u201cunidentified pet animals,\u201d and Wabakken was not expected to find much of interest.\nWabakken, however, was not intimidated by scientific authority: While still in high school, he\u2019d published a paper questioning the official counts of threatened bird species in Norway. \u201cWhen things are described in black-and-white terms, then I get very curious,\u201d he told me when I met with him at the Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, the small technical college where he teaches.\nWabakken had heard and read enough about the local sightings to suspect that at least some were accurate, but there was no obvious way to confirm them. DNA testing of hair and scat was not yet possible; motion-sensitive camera \u201ctraps\u201d were not yet widely available; individual tracks in the snow could not be confidently distinguished from the tracks of dogs or wolf-dog hybrids. But Wabakken had time, and he had patience. Whenever he found a set of canine tracks in the snow, he followed it on skis\u2014sometimes for hundreds of miles and weeks at a time. He hypothesized that wolves, which, unlike domestic dogs, had no reliable source of food or shelter, would behave in ways that allowed them to save energy. He noticed that some of the animals he was tracking sought out shallower or more compacted snow, sticking closely to riverbanks, forest roads, and tire tracks. Some even used old moose prints to hopscotch over the landscape, stretching from one track to the next without dropping into the snow. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a dog move its paws so efficiently and elegantly,\u201d he said.\nAfter four winters of work, Wabakken concluded that between three and five wolves had taken up residence in Norway, but he didn\u2019t have definitive proof. And because he had purposely kept his distance from the animals he tracked\u2014he didn\u2019t want to influence their behavior\u2014he had not yet laid eyes on a Norwegian wolf.\nIn 1982, Wabakken was invited to present his findings at an international mammal conference in Helsinki. As a young, unproven researcher, he expected that only a handful of people would listen to his report. Due to a scheduling mix-up, however, his talk was squeezed between presentations by two eminent scientists, and he spoke to a captive audience of hundreds. Wabakken won over the experts who heard him, and their endorsement convinced Scandinavian managers that wolves were back in Norway. The following year, a litter of wolf pups was spotted on the Norway-Sweden border, and for the first time in nearly a century, the peninsula had a documented breeding population of wolves.\nFor a while, the public reaction was muted. Few managers believed that the fledgling binational population would survive, and with good reason; to get to Sweden and Norway from Finland or Russia, which have substantial wolf populations, a wolf must either survive a long and dangerous journey through the S\u00e1mi reindeer-herding districts of northern Scandinavia, where legal protection for wolves is relatively weak, or cross at least 90 miles of unpredictable Baltic sea ice. But by 1990, at least one more wolf had managed the trip, and the small band founded a thriving population. By 2002, as many as a hundred wolves in eight family packs were in southern Sweden and Norway. Last winter, researchers counted 305 wolves in Sweden and 94 in Norway, living in a total of 41 packs. Lynx, bears, and wolverines have rebounded, too.\nAs the wolf population expanded, resistance to it grew. During the decades in which wolves and other predators had been scarce or absent, Norwegian farmers had begun allowing their sheep to scatter in the mountains each summer, believing that dispersed animals could make the most of the sparse vegetation; they even developed breeds known for their disinterest in herding. Norwegian moose hunters, who traditionally work with elkhounds on leashes, had begun to train their dogs to run loose in the forest after quarries. \u201cThe return of the wolves represented a change in a system that had taken many, many years to build up,\u201d says John Linnell of the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research. Polls consistently showed that the majority of Norwegians supported wolf recovery, but as the sheep and dog casualties mounted, the pitch and volume of the complaints increased.\nWabakken recognized that the wolves\u2019 survival depended on their human neighbors\u2019 ability to cooperate across borders: Sweden and Norway, despite their proximity and linguistic similarities, are divided by history, culture, and, most recently, the boundary of the European Union (Norwegian voters, famously, rejected EU membership twice, first in 1972 and again in 1994). While Sweden is bound by the environmental regulations of the EU, Norway answers primarily to its own national laws and to the Bern Convention, a wildlife-protection treaty signed by all European countries; the practical result is that Sweden is required to accommodate many more wolves than its neighbor.\nTo ensure that scientists, at least, treated the countries\u2019 shared wolf population as a single unit, Wabakken co-founded SKANDULV, a Swedish-Norwegian wolf-research project, in 1998. Over the past two decades, Wabakken, his colleague Barbara Zimmerman, and their collaborators in Sweden and Norway have monitored the growth of the population, tracked the movements of radio-collared wolves, and conducted genetic studies so extensive that they can describe the family tree of every wolf on the peninsula.\nYet this heavy investment of time and money\u2014by both countries\u2014has done little to reduce public opposition to wolf recovery in rural Norway. Though the Scandinavian wolf population remains among the smallest in Europe, the political divide over the animals is at least as deep and stubborn as anywhere on the continent.\nTo anyone familiar with the rural United States, rural Norway is almost disconcertingly prosperous. On an early evening in mid-September of last year, in the eastern Norwegian town of Elverum\u2014a winding half-hour drive south of Wabakken\u2019s college campus\u2014teenagers chased soccer balls across vivid green fields, and Teslas purred past the neat storefronts that line the wide main street. On the outskirts of town, in the lingering autumn sunlight, nearly 300 people stood outside the Norwegian Forest Museum, waiting to be let through the front doors. They filed into the museum\u2019s spacious atrium, helped themselves to black coffee and sweet bread, and settled into chairs arranged in careful rows. The only suggestion that this gathering was anything other than a well-attended community meeting were the two uniformed police officers stationed discreetly in the atrium\u2019s balcony.\nThough wolves were the ostensible subject of the meeting, they were present only in effigy, and only on the distant edges of the crowd. In the museum foyer, a taxidermied wolf eyed arriving visitors. Upstairs, in a darkened gallery, another stood in a too-small glass case, head thrown high and teeth bared as if about to howl.\nThe September meeting\u2019s organizer was Gunnar Gundersen, a former member of Parliament who swam the 400-meter medley in the 1976 Olympics in Montreal and still cuts a powerful figure at the podium. A wealthy private-forest owner, he works for a national timber cooperative and heads a regional alliance of forestry and farming organizations. The meeting, he told me later, was intended to \u201cput a bit of pressure\u201d on the national environment ministry. For most of three hours, as the deputy environment minister hunched uncomfortably at a long table in the front of the room, a succession of invited speakers endeavored to do exactly that.\nWhile the translator I was working with whispered subtitles into my ear, a local hunter reported that his beloved elkhound had been killed by a wolf\u2014then got some laughs by poking fun at the absent environment minister Ola Elvestuen, known for both his sympathy for wolves and his dandified good looks. Diminutive, white-haired Gunnar Gl\u00f6ersen, a representative from the Swedish Hunters Association, warned that if the government didn\u2019t permit more wolf hunting in Norway, hunters would take matters into their own hands and start poaching the animals.\nSeveral area farmers said that the continued killing of livestock by wolves threatened their livelihood. More than 2,600 sheep and lambs were documented by government officials as having been killed by wolves in 2018\u2014Norway\u2019s agricultural daily often led with bloody photos of disemboweled lambs\u2014and while those casualties represent a small fraction of the roughly 2 million sheep and lambs that graze freely in the forest each summer, some farmers were hit disproportionately hard. (The government compensates farmers for documented losses of sheep to wolves, but as many farmers point out, the payments don\u2019t cover the costs of extra shepherds and other indirect impacts to their businesses.)\nThe evening\u2019s argument revolved around the number of wolf packs permitted to live in Norway. In late 2016, a resolution by the Norwegian Parliament set a target of \u201cfour to six\u201d litters in the binational population each year, with at least three born to packs living entirely within Norwegian borders. Regional authorities were allowed to permit hunters to \u201ccull\u201d or shoot additional animals, and a total of 30 wolves were legally shot by private or state-employed hunters between June of 2017 and March of 2018. Another 20 have been shot since June of 2018. Wolf numbers still exceed the target set by Parliament, however, and most of those who spoke at the meeting\u2014including several irate members of Parliament\u2014wanted the national environment ministry to allow more hunting and fewer wolves.\nElvestuen, however, has been reluctant to expand the wolf hunt. In contrast to the parliamentary agreement, both Norway\u2019s national environmental law and the international Bern Convention state that no species can be hunted until its populations are self-sustaining within national borders\u2014which some legal scholars interpret to mean that more wolf packs should be allowed to survive and reproduce in Norway. The matter is currently in court, with conservation groups and agricultural and hunting organizations lining up on opposing sides.\nThe disagreement runs far deeper than numbers. For Norway, which declared its independence from Sweden just over a century ago and was occupied and nearly starved out by German forces during World War II, domestic food production is a matter of both national security and national pride. In recent decades, the government has gone to great lengths to keep farmers and rural communities solvent. (Norwegian voters opposed EU membership partly because they feared it would lead to cuts in state agricultural subsidies, which currently make up about 60 percent of farmers\u2019 gross income.) But farming is and always has been a marginal enterprise in cold, soil-poor Norway, and despite the generous government support, more than half of the country\u2019s farmers work second jobs.\nWhen sheep farmers say that wolves are threatening their livelihood, or hunters say their traditions are endangered, they\u2019re rarely talking about their individual survival: Norway\u2019s extensive, tax-supported welfare state guarantees every Norwegian a basic level of economic and social security. What most mean, fundamentally, is that wolves look like yet another threat to Norway\u2019s hard-won independence.\nSuch fears surfaced throughout the meeting, and toward the end of the evening, when the floor was opened to public comment, they were echoed by many in the mostly older, predominantly male, and almost entirely white audience. But the room held other fears, too. \u201cMy family is going to tell me to shut up,\u201d said a young, dark-haired woman who declined to identify herself. \u201cBut not everyone in Elverum is against wolves.\u201d The crowd muttered, and there was scattered applause.\nThe next speaker, Kari Wenche Fossum, wore her long gray hair in a loose twist, and surveyed the audience through round glasses. \u201cI\u2019m going to say something you don\u2019t want to hear about being outside, about feeling safe,\u201d she said calmly. Because of her support for wolves and other predators, she continued, \u201cI\u2019ve been physically threatened, I\u2019ve been injured twice. I want to encourage everyone to think about this. It\u2019s not just you guys who are suffering.\u201d\nThe relationship between Norwegian humans and Norwegian wolves is, in some ways, distinctive. Because of Norway\u2019s investment in rural life, its countryside is more populated than Sweden\u2019s, and Norwegian sheep farmers have hung on while most of their Swedish counterparts have simply moved out of wolf habitat. And some Norwegian politicians have found that it is both possible and politically convenient to keep compensating farmers and hunters for wolf damage, all the while promising a radical reduction in wolf numbers\u2014a strategy that gives their constituents little incentive to adapt.\nPublic attitudes toward wolves in Norway, and in northern Europe as a whole, also seem to be less tolerant than attitudes in southern and eastern Europe, where some farmers have never known a world without wolves. There, defensive practices such as keeping sheep in tighter, more closely supervised herds are considered routine. \u201cWolves might be a pain, you might not like them, but eventually, there is not much sense in protesting against them,\u201d says the researcher Nathan Ranc, who studies carnivores in Italy, France, and elsewhere. \u201cThey\u2019re like a storm or an avalanche. They\u2019re there, and it\u2019s part of the job to deal with them.\u201d\nAt the same time, what\u2019s happened to the public discussion about wolves in Norway in recent years is exactly what\u2019s happened to discussions of all kinds, all over the world: It has become more and more polarized, sometimes violently so. In 2009, an Elverum-area resident named Tore Hauge was so outraged by the illegal killing of a local wolf that he personally offered a reward of 50,000 Norwegian kroner\u2014about $8,000 at the time\u2014for information leading to the culprit. After his offer appeared in the newspaper, garbage was dumped in his driveway, and his outbuildings and fences were vandalized. One night, when he was out of town, his wife awoke to a loud buzzing noise and realized that a group of people had encircled the house and were marching around it, waving chain saws. Wenche Fossum, who spoke at the Elverum meeting, told me that she has been the target of threats for more than a decade.\nCritics of the government\u2019s wolf policy have fewer and less extreme stories of harassment, but they feel the sharp edges of polarization, too. Three herding-cooperative leaders told me that every time they appear on television to talk about their problems with wolves, they are blasted with vicious texts and calls from wolf supporters.\nThe Norwegian sociologist Ketil Skogen, who has studied the wolf controversy for two decades, says that its deepest divisions are between rural and urban Norwegians. Since World War II, in Norway and the rest of the developed world, the growth of the urban middle class\u2014both in numbers and political and cultural influence\u2014has fostered a sense of inferiority in rural communities. Many rural people feel, not without reason, that their practical knowledge and experience are dismissed by more formally trained urban \u201cexperts,\u201d and some have responded to perceived and real disrespect with a deep skepticism of science and scientific authority. These urban-rural resentments, Skogen has found, can obscure even vast class differences, creating political alliances between large rural landowners such as Gundersen and working-class hunters and farmers.\nGundersen has worked with farmers\u2019 and landowners\u2019 groups to mobilize this alliance, and this past January, they drew an estimated 7,000 protesters to a torchlight parade in Oslo. Supporters of wolf recovery have also organized large protests, with several thousand people turning out for demonstrations across the country this winter. Vi er vikinger, ikke veikinger, (We are Vikings, not weaklings), read one pro-wolf demonstrator\u2019s sign.\nIn Norway, like everywhere else, these divides are deepened by social media. During my week of conversations in rural Norway\u2014in farmyards, in offices, and over teatime waffles in cozy kitchens\u2014I heard repeatedly that the nastiest arguments about wolves take place on Facebook. Social media have bred conspiracy theories, too, with many wolf opponents insisting, for instance, that the wolves were secretly trucked into Scandinavia and released. (There are many variations on this rumor, all fanciful extrapolations of a real but stillborn Swedish proposal to reintroduce wolves in the 1970s.) The theory is so persistent that a group of landowners in eastern Norway commissioned a second set of wolf DNA analyses, separate from those already conducted by SKANDULV, in hopes that the results would suggest that the animals were descended from captives or came from far outside the region. Wolf opponents have also convinced the Norwegian government to sponsor two additional studies. But none has found any evidence of deliberate reintroduction.\nEven for a visitor, the polarization can be exhausting\u2014and frustrating, for the stereotypes that help maintain it usually collapse in conversation. One of the most passionate wolf opponents I spoke with, a sheep farmer and the leader of a local herding cooperative, grew up outside Oslo and took up farming only after pursuing a career in the city. Marte Conradi of the World Wildlife Fund, whom I met with in a swank coffee bar at the Oslo airport as she was returning from a conference on European predators, grew up in a tiny town in eastern Norway and worked for several years as a county-level wildlife manager. Tore Hauge, who put up the reward for the wolf poacher, grew up in Rena, near Elverum, and before his recent retirement made a living mining coal and building highway tunnels. And not many wolf opponents are more skeptical of scientific authority than their sworn enemy Petter Wabakken.\nEven those who think wolves have no place in Norway insisted to me that they have no problem with wolves in general, and many spoke of them with admiration. This might have been what they thought I wanted to hear, but I heard it expressed so many times, and in such detail, that I came to believe it was at least partly sincere. J\u00f8rn Stener, a hunting guide and a fierce critic of the government\u2019s handling of the wolf recovery, sounded almost reverent when he recalled the first of his many encounters with wolves in the woods. \u201cThey\u2019re smart, they\u2019re adaptable\u2014they\u2019re amazing animals,\u201d he said.\nThough politics may or may not allow the Scandinavian wolf population to expand in eastern Norway, Norwegian wolves are almost certainly here to stay. \u201cYou can sit and dream about the time when we didn\u2019t have large carnivores,\u201d Wabakken said. \u201cBut that dream is over.\u201d Even if resident wolves were to be killed or driven out, as they were in previous centuries, young wolves born to Swedish packs would soon wander over the border to take their place. Eventually, farmers in wolf habitat will have to adjust: They will have to switch from raising sheep to raising cows, which are less vulnerable to wolf predation, or follow the lead of farmers such as Morten and Linda Ulvedalen, who recently bought a farmstead inside the wolf-management zone.\nMorten Ulvedalen is the CEO of a specialty construction-supply company in Oslo, and the couple was able to afford enough land to both keep their sheep enclosed in the summer and grow grass for winter feed (many sheep farmers point out that they need to graze their animals in the mountains in the summer in order to use their pasture to grow feed). With the help of a government grant, they were also able to afford a burly electric fence from New Zealand, and their sheep now graze placidly within it. Linda Ulvedalen, who breeds sheep, is especially interested in reviving older breeds that are less likely to scatter in the woods. Though their surname translates to \u201cWolf Valley,\u201d neither of the Ulvedalens is particularly happy about the expansion of the wolf population, and when I visited their farm, Morten Ulvedalen was quick to point out that government grants don\u2019t cover the full cost of their adaptations. Such practical measures, however, give livestock the best chance at coexisting with wolves.\nLarger pastures and stronger fences don\u2019t heal the deeper divide over wolf recovery, though. The first step toward doing that, says John Odden, a predator researcher with the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, is for opposing groups to agree on a shared set of facts. Odden uses camera traps to gather data on predator populations, and about five years ago he began to set up cameras around a community where government estimates of lynx numbers, and the consequent limits on lynx hunting, had been met with great skepticism. Odden, who grew up in the countryside not far from Elverum, decided to involve the community in his project, convincing local hunters to advise him on the placement of the cameras and help him collect the camera data cards. Some hunters got involved because they hoped to prove the government wrong; others just wanted to geek out about the fancy cameras. But one participant, Jan Erik Olbergsveen, says that those who took part in the data collection gained more confidence in its accuracy, and skepticism faded.\nOdden has since organized a similar project to track wolf movements near communities in eastern Norway, and while wolves are much more controversial and politically complex than lynx, he has once again enlisted locals to help place and check the cameras. Some of the angriest anti-wolf voices at the Elverum meeting, in fact, belonged to his volunteer data collectors.\nThe reasons for opposing wolf recovery in Norway, as in most of the rest of the world, are pretty straightforward: inconvenience, cost, fear of change, fear of fangs. The reasons for championing wolves\u2014for going to court on their behalf, for inviting anger and worse by speaking up for their protection, for spending excruciating amounts of money visiting the captive pack at Polar Park\u2014are harder to pin down.\nIn the United States, supporters of wolf reintroduction and recovery often point to the importance of large predators in ecosystems, especially to the measurable changes in the flora and fauna of Yellowstone National Park since the return of wolves. But in Europe, where most ecosystems are highly human-dominated, few wolf supporters expect wolf restoration to lead to a broader recovery of ecological processes. Some value wolves as symbols of wildness, or nature, or the limits of human influence, but most make another argument for wolf recovery: They say that wolves have a right (up to a point) to survive and repopulate the places where their kind once lived, and that humans have a duty (up to a point) to accommodate them.\nThe idea that humans should accommodate other large predators is nothing new, and it\u2019s far from exclusively urban. In 1893, Swedish authorities ended a long-standing bounty on brown bears because they realized that the country\u2019s bear population was about to go extinct. \u201cIt is a matter of honor for our country that this interesting animal be protected from complete extermination,\u201d the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences stated in 1905. Concern about the extinction of other species\u2014useful to humans and not\u2014was by that time widespread throughout North America and Europe. Since then, measures to protect other species have been almost constantly challenged, but the general notion of species survival and recovery as a good thing has persisted worldwide.\nEven opponents of wolf expansion in Norway indirectly acknowledge the existence of these rights and duties: One reason for the longevity of the clandestine-reintroduction conspiracy theory, for example, is that reintroduced wolves are seen as having a much lesser claim to the Norwegian countryside than animals that returned on their own, and would therefore be politically easier to drive out. Even the complaint that \u201cwolves have more rights than we do,\u201d often heard in eastern Norway, implies that both parties have at least some rights.\nThe trouble with wolves, of course, is that their pursuit of survival collides with ours. While some species demand little of people in order to survive, large, free-roaming predators can require humans to change their habits, their livelihood, and even their place in the food chain. Norwegians, who live in one of the wealthiest and best-educated countries in the world, have an opportunity to reduce these conflicts: to hack through the accumulated mistrust and resentment, identify the genuine burdens that accompany meaningful predator recovery, and figure out, as a society, how to share those burdens more equitably. If they can do that, they will have taken a step toward solving one of the wickedest problems in conservation. If they can\u2019t, conservation will remain a job that gets done when convenient\u2014and rarely otherwise.\n\u201cIf we can conserve predators, we can conserve everything,\u201d says Guillaume Chapron, a wildlife researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. \u201cIf we can\u2019t conserve predators, it doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d\nToward the end of my visit to Polar Park, I asked Stig Sletten, who had accompanied our small group into the wolf enclosure, whether he had time to talk. Sletten, the park\u2019s head animal keeper, was clearly reluctant to be interviewed, but after disappearing for several hours to finish what he said were some much-needed repairs to the musk-ox shelter, he consented to a conversation.\nPolar Park, which was dreamed up in a bar by a group of locals hoping to bring more tourists to the area, opened in 1994 and is now supported primarily by entrance fees and corporate sponsorships. Sletten, who grew up nearby, was one of the park\u2019s first employees, and after more than a decade in the Norwegian military, he returned to the park full-time in 2008. Soft-spoken, with white hair that contrasts with his unlined face, Sletten is as alert and wary as a wolf, noticing everything but giving little away. He\u2019s aware of the resemblance, and said it serves him well inside the enclosure: \u201cI do have to sniff around a bit, notice what people are feeling and thinking, whether someone\u2019s nervous,\u201d he said, raising his pointer fingers above his temples to resemble ears.\nWhen I asked him what he hopes people will take from the experience, he turned serious. \u201cI don\u2019t want to force anyone to like it or not like it,\u201d he said. Many visitors, like me, cry when the wolves approach them. Some cry when the keepers judge them too small or frail to enter the enclosure safely. Some brag to their friends and family that they have a special way with animals, and are embarrassed when the wolves ignore them. Some are preoccupied with their cameras. And some are scared, which doesn\u2019t bother Sletten. \u201cThey\u2019re going to meet a predator\u2014they\u2019re going to meet a wolf. It\u2019s okay that they\u2019re scared, maybe even a good thing,\u201d he said. Far more dangerous, he added, would be to have no fear at all.\nI wasn\u2019t especially afraid in the enclosure, though maybe I should have been; as much as the wolves look, behave, and even smell like large dogs, they can turn on one another with shocking speed, snapping and growling with fleeting but genuine menace. With humans, however, they are simply nosy. They placidly investigated our small group, then loped off, then returned, coming and going for about an hour. Prompted by a couple of convincing howls from their keepers, they let out a piercing, unruly chorus of yips and yelps that seemed to linger in the fog.\nWhen we finally filed through the heavy gate and departed, skirting the outside of the enclosure, Frigg and her pack mates followed us on their side of the fence, whining indignantly and gnawing at saplings. They didn\u2019t need us, and they certainly didn\u2019t love us, but they wanted us to stick around. The fascination, like the trepidation, is instinctive\u2014and mutual.",

But the end of the year brings out a slew of opportunities for penmanship: adding notes to holiday cards to old friends, addressing them, and then doing the same with thank-you notes after Christmas. And given how little I write in the other 11 months of the year, that means there are a lot of errors, which in turn spur a new connection with another old friend: Wite-Out.</p>\n<p>The sticky, white fluid and its chief rival, Liquid Paper, are peculiar anachronisms, throwbacks to the era of big hair, big cars, and big office stationery budgets. They were designed to help workers correct errors they made on typewriters without having to retype documents from the start. But typewriters have disappeared from the modern office, relegated to attics and museums. Even paper is disappearing from the modern office, as more and more functions are digitized. But correction fluids are not only surviving&mdash;they appear to be thriving, with Wite-Out sales climbing nearly 10 percent in 2017, according to the most recent public numbers. It&rsquo;s a mystery of the digital age.</p>\n<p>One sign of the cultural impact of the Wite-Out brand is that, like Kleenex, it has become a generic term. But it wasn&rsquo;t the first. Liquid Paper dates back to the 1950s, when Bette Nesmith Graham, a struggling divorced mother, took on typing jobs to make money. The problem was that she wasn&rsquo;t a good typist, and kept making mistakes. So she began experimenting with ways to cover up errors, enlisting her son Mike to help her. (This creative streak would help Mike in his career as an artist&mdash;first as a member of the Monkees, and later as a producer of films including <em>Repo Man</em>.) In 1958, she patented Liquid Paper.</p>\n<p>There were other products that achieved the same goal, such as strips of sticky paper that covered up errors, but Liquid Paper quickly eclipsed them&mdash;so much so that it soon drew imitators. In 1965, Tipp-Ex began producing its own fluid in Germany. A year later, George Kloosterhouse and Edwin Johanknecht, searching for a product that wouldn&rsquo;t show up when a document was photocopied, developed Wite-Out.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s difficult for anyone raised in the age of computers to grasp how useful correction fluids must have been when typewriters were a dominant technology in offices and classrooms. Of course, correction fluids are useful for things other than typewriting. In the pre-laser-printer era, it was often easier to correct a document from a dot-matrix printer by hand than to reprint it. Handwritten documents in ink are also more easily corrected with Wite-Out than rewritten.</p>\n<p>But today, <a data-omni-click=\"r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'\" href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2016/08/25/hp-fights-to-survive-decline-of-the-printer-market/\">even printer sales are down</a>, casualties of an era when more and more writing is executed on-screen and never printed or written out at all.

Somehow, more than a decade on, it has kept its ground. According to the NPD Group, which tracks marketing data, sales of correction fluid grew 1 percent from 2017 to 2018, though they fell 7 percent the year before. (Correction tapes were flat, while correction pens are fading.)

                "text": "Christmastime is when the pens in my house get their biggest workout of the year. Like many Americans above grammar-school age, I seldom write by hand anymore, outside of barely legible grocery lists. But the end of the year brings out a slew of opportunities for penmanship: adding notes to holiday cards to old friends, addressing them, and then doing the same with thank-you notes after Christmas. And given how little I write in the other 11 months of the year, that means there are a lot of errors, which in turn spur a new connection with another old friend: Wite-Out.\nThe sticky, white fluid and its chief rival, Liquid Paper, are peculiar anachronisms, throwbacks to the era of big hair, big cars, and big office stationery budgets. They were designed to help workers correct errors they made on typewriters without having to retype documents from the start. But typewriters have disappeared from the modern office, relegated to attics and museums. Even paper is disappearing from the modern office, as more and more functions are digitized. But correction fluids are not only surviving\u2014they appear to be thriving, with Wite-Out sales climbing nearly 10 percent in 2017, according to the most recent public numbers. It\u2019s a mystery of the digital age.\nOne sign of the cultural impact of the Wite-Out brand is that, like Kleenex, it has become a generic term. But it wasn\u2019t the first. Liquid Paper dates back to the 1950s, when Bette Nesmith Graham, a struggling divorced mother, took on typing jobs to make money. The problem was that she wasn\u2019t a good typist, and kept making mistakes. So she began experimenting with ways to cover up errors, enlisting her son Mike to help her. (This creative streak would help Mike in his career as an artist\u2014first as a member of the Monkees, and later as a producer of films including Repo Man.) In 1958, she patented Liquid Paper.\nThere were other products that achieved the same goal, such as strips of sticky paper that covered up errors, but Liquid Paper quickly eclipsed them\u2014so much so that it soon drew imitators. In 1965, Tipp-Ex began producing its own fluid in Germany. A year later, George Kloosterhouse and Edwin Johanknecht, searching for a product that wouldn\u2019t show up when a document was photocopied, developed Wite-Out.\nIt\u2019s difficult for anyone raised in the age of computers to grasp how useful correction fluids must have been when typewriters were a dominant technology in offices and classrooms. Of course, correction fluids are useful for things other than typewriting. In the pre-laser-printer era, it was often easier to correct a document from a dot-matrix printer by hand than to reprint it. Handwritten documents in ink are also more easily corrected with Wite-Out than rewritten.\nBut today, even printer sales are down, casualties of an era when more and more writing is executed on-screen and never printed or written out at all. In fact, the office-supply industry as a whole is slumping. According to a report by the analysis firm Technavio, the U.S. stationery and office-supply market is essentially flat, projected to go from $86.4 billion in 2015 to $87.5 billion by 2018. The paper industry has had it especially bad.\nYet correction fluid remains remarkably resilient. As early as 2005, The New York Times pondered the product\u2019s fate with trepidation. Somehow, more than a decade on, it has kept its ground. According to the NPD Group, which tracks marketing data, sales of correction fluid grew 1 percent from 2017 to 2018, though they fell 7 percent the year before. (Correction tapes were flat, while correction pens are fading.) From 2015 to 2016 to 2017, Bic, which makes Wite-Out and Tipp-Ex, reported that correction products increased in share from 5 to 6 to 9 percent of the global stationery market. It\u2019s a little less clear how Liquid Paper is doing. Newell, which owns the brand, doesn\u2019t break down earnings enough to tell, and the company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nWho\u2019s still buying these things? All the best answers are mostly conjecture. AdWeek suggested that sales might be buoyed by artists using fluid as paint. A Bic spokesperson pointed to a series of weird and entertaining interactive YouTube ads for Tipp-Ex in Europe, and said that Wite-Out is launching \u201ccolored dispensers that will appeal to younger consumers.\u201d\nThat sounds faintly ridiculous\u2014what use is a colorful bauble to a digital native?\u2014but there may be something to it. Even as paper sales dip, upmarket stationery is one subsegment that is expected to grow, thanks to a Millennial affection for personalized stationery. Tia Frapolli, the president of NPD\u2019s office-supplies practice, pointed to bullet-journaling and hand-lettering as paper-based trends that could breathe some life into correction fluids.\nWite-Out is a strange place for serial-killing Millennials to offer clemency. In part, the attraction to the material is the same as any other handmade or small-batch product: The physical act of covering up a mistake is imperfect but more satisfying than simply hitting backspace. There\u2019s also a poignancy to a screwed generation gravitating toward Wite-Out.\nYou can\u2019t erase the past anymore than you can erase a printed typo or a written error\u2014but you can paper it over and pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

You recently pulled in $6.1 million and I commend you,&quot; she said, but was interrupted by applause. &quot;You broke all records which i guess is pretty good!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;But my concern is how much of that comes from a process that is called bundling,&quot; she continued. &quot;For those of you who don't know, bundling is a process in which political activists and people in the private sector and lobbyists go to wealthy multi-millionaires and billionaires and basically tell them to give the maximum which is normally anywhere from $2,700 to $5,600 and basically use it to over-inflate a campaigner's first day totals.&quot;</p>\n<p>She gave an example where only a thousand people giving $5,600 would be reported as a $5.6 million campaign haul.</p>\n<p>&quot;Your campaign has not released the number of individual donors you have nor has it released the um average donation,&quot; she continued. &quot;Now, I'm not accusing you of that but the fact that your campaign is currently working with a notorious mega bundler Louis Susman gives me a bit of a clue!</p>\n<p>&quot;In addition,&quot; she added, &quot;when we look on your website, we don't see anything in terms of a solid platform for policy, it's mostly platitudes and your merch store. So I guess two-prong question...&quot;</p>\n<p>The audience did not like the tone of her question and began to shout her down, but O'Rourke calmed them and asked them to let her speak.</p>\n<p>&quot;Two-prong question,&quot; she asked. &quot;One, are you going to release the number of individual donors and their average donor donation because I know your campaign has that data, if it didn't it would mean you are running a very incompetent campaign, and I don't think you are, you seem to have your stuff together mostly, and two, when am I going to get an actually policy from you instead of just platitudes and stories?&quot;</p>\n<p>O'Rourke jumped right into the first question, but when the interlocutor demanded to know when he would be providing the documents he promised, he did not respond.</p>\n<p>He continued to name a few policies that he had been more concrete about, including criminal justice reform, de-criminalization of marijuana, and universal guaranteed health care.</p>\n<p>The student mirrored from CNN's Anderson Cooper, who <a href=\"https://www.theblaze.com/news/anderson-cooper-notices-beto-orourke-has-a-lot-of-merchandise-on-his-website-not-a-lot-of-substance\">remarked that O'Rourke's campaign</a> website had a lot of merchandise for sale, but didn't have much in the way of policy solutions.</p>\n<h3>Watch the contentious question below:</h3>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Je47wdQ910U?rel=0&enablejsapi=1\"></iframe></figure>",

You recently pulled in $6.1 million and I commend you,\" she said, but was interrupted by applause. \"You broke all records which i guess is pretty good!\"\n\"But my concern is how much of that comes from a process that is called bundling,\" she continued. \"For those of you who don't know, bundling is a process in which political activists and people in the private sector and lobbyists go to wealthy multi-millionaires and billionaires and basically tell them to give the maximum which is normally anywhere from $2,700 to $5,600 and basically use it to over-inflate a campaigner's first day totals.\"\nShe gave an example where only a thousand people giving $5,600 would be reported as a $5.6 million campaign haul.\n\"Your campaign has not released the number of individual donors you have nor has it released the um average donation,\" she continued. \"Now, I'm not accusing you of that but the fact that your campaign is currently working with a notorious mega bundler Louis Susman gives me a bit of a clue!\n\"In addition,\" she added, \"when we look on your website, we don't see anything in terms of a solid platform for policy, it's mostly platitudes and your merch store. So I guess two-prong question...\"\nThe audience did not like the tone of her question and began to shout her down, but O'Rourke calmed them and asked them to let her speak.\n\"Two-prong question,\" she asked. \"One, are you going to release the number of individual donors and their average donor donation because I know your campaign has that data, if it didn't it would mean you are running a very incompetent campaign, and I don't think you are, you seem to have your stuff together mostly, and two, when am I going to get an actually policy from you instead of just platitudes and stories?\"\nO'Rourke jumped right into the first question, but when the interlocutor demanded to know when he would be providing the documents he promised, he did not respond.\nHe continued to name a few policies that he had been more concrete about, including criminal justice reform, de-criminalization of marijuana, and universal guaranteed health care.\nThe student mirrored from CNN's Anderson Cooper, who remarked that O'Rourke's campaign website had a lot of merchandise for sale, but didn't have much in the way of policy solutions.\nWatch the contentious question below:",

                "html": "<p>CNN received a prestigious journalism award for a televised town hall event after the Parkland, Florida, massacre that was really a gun control advocacy event at which conservatives were berated and verbally abused, according to <a href=\"https://hotair.com/archives/2019/03/19/cnn-wins-cronkite-award-garbage-gun-control-town-hall-held-parkland/\">Hot Air</a>.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the mass killing at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018, CNN set up an event that included some survivors of the tragedy, National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch, Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, and Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.</p>\n<p>The event was not remotely journalistic in nature; instead, it was set up to scapegoat conservatives Rubio and Loesch as having contributed to the tragedy by way of their views on gun rights.</p>\n<p>Still, the University of Southern California's Norman Lear Center awarded CNN the &quot;<a href=\"https://learcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WalterCronkiteAwards2019Winners-1.pdf\">Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Television Political Journalism</a>,&quot; even though the event itself was titled, &quot;The Students of Stoneman Douglas Demand Action.&quot; It was activism, not journalism.</p>\n<p>Hot Air's Allahpundit summarized what the event, and the award, say about the state of mainstream media:</p>\n<blockquote>It was embarrassing all the way through, less town hall than mob catharsis, and of course they're being rewarded for it by industry watchdogs rather than reprimanded. If you wonder why big media is frequently so terrible, this is a small part of the answer: They're incentivized to be that way by their own gatekeepers.</blockquote>\n<p>One of the lowlights of the event was when Parkland survivor Cameron Kasky told Rubio that he couldn't look at him &quot;and not look down the barrel of an AR-15 and not look at Nikolas Cruz&quot; before demanding that Rubio reject any future support from the NRA.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lo52BObqCds?rel=0&enablejsapi=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Loesch said after the event that CNN blindsided her in terms of what her role would be at the event and about how intentionally antagonistic the environment would be against her, and also said a woman tried to physically attack her after the broadcast.</p>\n<p>&quot;I showed up in good faith for genuine conversation knowing that at best, it would be a tough event,&quot; Loesch tweeted. &quot;The lengths @CNNPR went to inflame emotions and exploit pain to *put on a show* is inexcusable, shameful, and it's grotesque they're celebrating getting an 'award' for their conduct.&quot;</p>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1108066662098587648\"><p>@CNNPR @CronkiteAward I showed up in good faith for genuine conversation knowing that at best, it would be a tough&hellip; https://t.co/d2XJfhenJy</p> &mdash; Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DLoesch/statuses/1108066662098587648\">1553018653.0</a></blockquote>",

Marco Rubio, and Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.\nThe event was not remotely journalistic in nature; instead, it was set up to scapegoat conservatives Rubio and Loesch as having contributed to the tragedy by way of their views on gun rights.\nStill, the University of Southern California's Norman Lear Center awarded CNN the \"Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Television Political Journalism,\" even though the event itself was titled, \"The Students of Stoneman Douglas Demand Action.\" It was activism, not journalism.\nHot Air's Allahpundit summarized what the event, and the award, say about the state of mainstream media:\nIt was embarrassing all the way through, less town hall than mob catharsis, and of course they're being rewarded for it by industry watchdogs rather than reprimanded. If you wonder why big media is frequently so terrible, this is a small part of the answer: They're incentivized to be that way by their own gatekeepers.\nOne of the lowlights of the event was when Parkland survivor Cameron Kasky told Rubio that he couldn't look at him \"and not look down the barrel of an AR-15 and not look at Nikolas Cruz\" before demanding that Rubio reject any future support from the NRA.\nLoesch said after the event that CNN blindsided her in terms of what her role would be at the event and about how intentionally antagonistic the environment would be against her, and also said a woman tried to physically attack her after the broadcast.\n\"I showed up in good faith for genuine conversation knowing that at best, it would be a tough event,\" Loesch tweeted. \"The lengths @CNNPR went to inflame emotions and exploit pain to *put on a show* is inexcusable, shameful, and it's grotesque they're celebrating getting an 'award' for their conduct.\"\n@CNNPR @CronkiteAward I showed up in good faith for genuine conversation knowing that at best, it would be a tough\u2026 https://t.co/d2XJfhenJy\n\u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) 1553018653.0",

                "html": "<p>Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee plans to introduce a constitutional amendment that would limit the number of justices on the Supreme Court, a direct response to Democratic presidential candidates who have proposed expanding the court, according to <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/434772-gop-rep-to-introduce-constitutional-amendment-limiting-supreme-court-seats-to\">The Hill</a>.</p>\n<p>Several candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have proposed or expressed an openness to increasing the number of Supreme Court justices, claiming that expansion would combat an alleged politicization of the courts.</p>\n<p>&quot;Schemes to pack the court are dangerous to the Founders' vision of an independent judiciary that serves as a check on both the Executive and Legislative branches of government,&quot; Green said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The Constitution currently does not dictate how many justices are on the Supreme Court. The court has had nine justices since 1869.</p>\n<h3>Why do Democrats want to expand the Supreme Court?</h3>\n<p>The political conflict over the Supreme Court has steadily escalated since 2016, when Republicans blocked Judge Merrick Garland from getting a confirmation hearing after former President Barack Obama nominated Garland. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) believed that an outgoing president should not be allowed to appoint a justice.</p>\n<p>Since then, President Donald Trump has appointed two justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, to the Supreme Court, shifting the ideological balance in a way that Democrats claim threatens the impartiality of the judicial branch.</p>\n<p>&quot;This central objective that is to prevent the Supreme Court from continuing on this trajectory to become basically ruined by being a nakedly political institution, this idea of adding justices is one way to do it,&quot; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor and Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said on Pod Save America.</p>\n<p>According to The Hill, Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke want to give Republicans five justices and Democrats five justices, then have those 10 justices agree on five more justices to complete a 15-justice Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Other Democrats, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have accused Republicans of &quot;stealing&quot; Supreme Court seats, which she feels justifies a potential move to pack the court to favor Democrats.</p>\n<p>&quot;First they steal a Supreme Court seat, and then they turn around and change the rules on the filibuster on a Supreme Court seat,&quot; Warren said, according to <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/some-2020-democrats-want-dramatic-increase-of-supreme-court-justices\">Fox News</a>. &quot;So when it swings back to us, what are we going to do? I think all options are on the table.&quot;</p>\n<p>Green said in his statement that he plans to introduce the amendment on Thursday.</p>\n<p>&quot;The Supreme Court must remain a fair and impartial branch of government not beholden to a party,&quot; Green said in the statement.</p>",

                "text": "Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee plans to introduce a constitutional amendment that would limit the number of justices on the Supreme Court, a direct response to Democratic presidential candidates who have proposed expanding the court, according to The Hill.\nSeveral candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have proposed or expressed an openness to increasing the number of Supreme Court justices, claiming that expansion would combat an alleged politicization of the courts.\n\"Schemes to pack the court are dangerous to the Founders' vision of an independent judiciary that serves as a check on both the Executive and Legislative branches of government,\" Green said in a statement.\nThe Constitution currently does not dictate how many justices are on the Supreme Court. The court has had nine justices since 1869.\nWhy do Democrats want to expand the Supreme Court?\nThe political conflict over the Supreme Court has steadily escalated since 2016, when Republicans blocked Judge Merrick Garland from getting a confirmation hearing after former President Barack Obama nominated Garland. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) believed that an outgoing president should not be allowed to appoint a justice.\nSince then, President Donald Trump has appointed two justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, to the Supreme Court, shifting the ideological balance in a way that Democrats claim threatens the impartiality of the judicial branch.\n\"This central objective that is to prevent the Supreme Court from continuing on this trajectory to become basically ruined by being a nakedly political institution, this idea of adding justices is one way to do it,\" South Bend, Indiana, Mayor and Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said on Pod Save America.\nAccording to The Hill, Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke want to give Republicans five justices and Democrats five justices, then have those 10 justices agree on five more justices to complete a 15-justice Supreme Court.\nOther Democrats, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have accused Republicans of \"stealing\" Supreme Court seats, which she feels justifies a potential move to pack the court to favor Democrats.\n\"First they steal a Supreme Court seat, and then they turn around and change the rules on the filibuster on a Supreme Court seat,\" Warren said, according to Fox News. \"So when it swings back to us, what are we going to do? I think all options are on the table.\"\nGreen said in his statement that he plans to introduce the amendment on Thursday.\n\"The Supreme Court must remain a fair and impartial branch of government not beholden to a party,\" Green said in the statement.",

The unnamed female student appears in the clip and said &quot;while I was putting on my pants I heard a man's voice, so I turned around, and he's standing there on the opposite aisle looking at me. I glanced down and could tell that he was wearing women's underwear and what was underneath it.&quot;</p>\n<p>She added: &quot;When I knew that a man was looking at me, I felt very violated and very scared &mdash; especially looking at me while I'm getting dressed.&quot;</p>\n<p>Attorney Andrea Shaw added in the video that &quot;opening up restrooms and locker rooms to members of the opposite sex is sexual harassment. Like most forms of sexual harassment, the girls in this school have little power over their situation. The school's only solution for my client was for her to wait outside the locker room until the individual of the opposite sex was finished changing, and then she went in and was late for gym class and also late for her second period class.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;The school's offered solution made it clear that they believed that my client was the problem,&quot; Shaw also said in the clip.</p>\n<p>The female student's parents also speak in the video, and they aren't identified.

                "html": "<p>Feminist icon Gloria Steinem likened anti-abortion conservatives to former German dictator Adolf Hitler during an interview on <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/today/video/today-third-hour-feb-25-2019/3910956\">NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show</a>.</p>\n<p>During the program's third hour Monday, co-hosts Dylan Dreyer, Al Roker, and Craig Melvin chatted with Steinem about the new edition of her book &mdash; &quot;Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions,&quot; originally published in 1983 &mdash; and Melvin asked Steinem what she wants the &quot;new generation&quot; of readers to take away from the book.</p>\n<p>Steinem, 84, replied that &quot;the new generation of reader is instructing me by saying that these essays are still relevant,&quot; and then she noted two of them. First Steinem mentioned a &quot;parody&quot; titled, &quot;If Men Could Menstruate,&quot; which got some laughs from the rapt co-hosts.</p>\n<p>She then pointed to &quot;another&quot; essay &quot;on a more serious note to put it mildly, is why Hitler was actually elected &mdash; and he was elected, and he campaigned against abortion. I mean ... he padlocked the family planning clinics. OK, so that is still relevant in the terms of the right wing. So there were very few things, actually, that I had to take out.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;If Hitler Were Alive, Whose Side Would He Be On?<em>&quot;</em> was originally published in the October-November 1980 issue of Ms. magazine, which Steinem co-founded, and it became a <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=KVHmzw43TgkC&pg=PT529&lpg=PT529&dq=%22If+Hitler+were+alive,+whose+side+would+he+be+on?%22&source=bl&ots=fEJ4iw38Pm&sig=ACfU3U0RIYpRuifIwrm2bQ9WF1wKmkq9zw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwig2MuWltrgAhXiSt8KHYI5DagQ6AEwBHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22If%20Hitler%20were%20alive%2C%20whose%20side%20would%20he%20be%20on%3F%22&f=false\">chapter in Steinem's book</a>. In that chapter Steinem decries anti-abortion efforts of political and religious conservatives on the eve of what would be President Ronald Reagan's election and draws parallels to Hitler's dictatorial reign.</p>\n<p>Interestingly Steinem begins the chapter with quotes from conservatives comparing the genocide of abortion to Hitler's genocide of 6 million Jews in World War II &mdash; and apparently Steinem still sees a Hitler connection, just in an opposing direction.</p>\n<h3>Anything else?<br></h3>\n<p>After Melvin observed that &quot;some have tried to pervert the term ... feminism,&quot; Steinem recalled famous criticism from conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh and others, although without naming them: &quot;I've been called a 'femi-Nazi' by various people ... we won't name.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Let's not name names,&quot; Melvin said in agreement.</p>\n<p>Steinem also hit the public eye recently when <a href=\"https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-feminst-pastor-vagina-sculpture\">far-left pastor Nadia Bolz-Weber gifted her with a vagina sculpture made of melted down purity rings</a> &mdash; a gesture in front of a rapturous conference audience against Christian evangelicals.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.mrctv.org/embed/537408\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "Feminist icon Gloria Steinem likened anti-abortion conservatives to former German dictator Adolf Hitler during an interview on NBC's \"Today\" show.\nDuring the program's third hour Monday, co-hosts Dylan Dreyer, Al Roker, and Craig Melvin chatted with Steinem about the new edition of her book \u2014 \"Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions,\" originally published in 1983 \u2014 and Melvin asked Steinem what she wants the \"new generation\" of readers to take away from the book.\nSteinem, 84, replied that \"the new generation of reader is instructing me by saying that these essays are still relevant,\" and then she noted two of them. First Steinem mentioned a \"parody\" titled, \"If Men Could Menstruate,\" which got some laughs from the rapt co-hosts.\nShe then pointed to \"another\" essay \"on a more serious note to put it mildly, is why Hitler was actually elected \u2014 and he was elected, and he campaigned against abortion. I mean ... he padlocked the family planning clinics. OK, so that is still relevant in the terms of the right wing. So there were very few things, actually, that I had to take out.\"\n\"If Hitler Were Alive, Whose Side Would He Be On?\" was originally published in the October-November 1980 issue of Ms. magazine, which Steinem co-founded, and it became a chapter in Steinem's book. In that chapter Steinem decries anti-abortion efforts of political and religious conservatives on the eve of what would be President Ronald Reagan's election and draws parallels to Hitler's dictatorial reign.\nInterestingly Steinem begins the chapter with quotes from conservatives comparing the genocide of abortion to Hitler's genocide of 6 million Jews in World War II \u2014 and apparently Steinem still sees a Hitler connection, just in an opposing direction.\nAnything else?\nAfter Melvin observed that \"some have tried to pervert the term ... feminism,\" Steinem recalled famous criticism from conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh and others, although without naming them: \"I've been called a 'femi-Nazi' by various people ... we won't name.\"\n\"Let's not name names,\" Melvin said in agreement.\nSteinem also hit the public eye recently when far-left pastor Nadia Bolz-Weber gifted her with a vagina sculpture made of melted down purity rings \u2014 a gesture in front of a rapturous conference audience against Christian evangelicals.",

I don't want an out.&quot;</p>\n<p>He went on to say he didn't think that meant the administration was wavering in its support of him as a candidate. &quot;You know that the president is a fighter, and Kudlow is a fighter,&quot; Cain added. &quot;They might be getting a lot of blowback from some folks, I don't know. But I don't think they're getting uncomfortable with it.&quot;</p>\n<h3>Anything else?</h3>\n<p>Mr. Cain ran for the Republican Party's presidential nomination in 2012, before dropping out amid sexual assault allegations.</p>",

I don't want an out.\"\nHe went on to say he didn't think that meant the administration was wavering in its support of him as a candidate. \"You know that the president is a fighter, and Kudlow is a fighter,\" Cain added. \"They might be getting a lot of blowback from some folks, I don't know. But I don't think they're getting uncomfortable with it.\"\nAnything else?\nMr. Cain ran for the Republican Party's presidential nomination in 2012, before dropping out amid sexual assault allegations.",

His massive funeral was attended by many celebrities and leaders of the African-American community in celebration of his artistic contributions and political activism.\nRapper \"The Game\" called Ingraham a \"disrespectful c***\" and called on his 10.3 million followers on Instagram to demand she be fired by putting pressure on her advertisers.\n\"I'm asking all of my followers, fans, friends & family to spread this video with demands of #LauraIngrahams termination immediately !!!!!\" he commented.\nSnoop Dogg added simply, \"I'm in.\"\nVideo of Ingraham's comments were also circulated on Twitter.\nRapper T.I. posted a video of Ingraham's comments and excoriated her reaction on his Instagram account.\n\"This is Disgusting!

End it.&quot;</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/24/pediatrician-exposes-suicide-tips-children-hidden-videos-youtube-youtube-kids/\">Washington Post</a>, the person appeared to be holding an imaginary blade to the inside of his arm. His &quot;longways&quot; motion went from the bottom of his hand and down his forearm toward his elbow.</p>\n<p>More from CBS News:</p>\n<blockquote> The man featured is YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkitABalXafr-NqceQdDXtg\">Filthy Frank</a>, who has over 6.2 million subscribers and calls himself &quot;the embodiment of everything a person should not be,&quot; although there is no evidence that Frank, whose real name is George Miller, was involved in creating the doctored video. He did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment. </blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Free Hess of Gainesville posted the video on her PediMom <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PediMom/videos/396656447776491/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD7UEqGfzobOV3mXg69RPHAvnWYYgubGWH07DmDNR1nKKyQknbX05RRlSEQunOQKeNxWGvhoJYg2EN1gGiKPzLlecMLFijkp9-vsZ9qFvM4x_ZG_WFY_JGZnxGfDud6BPzdueJhPMthdezxmDXa5x6uSQy5KxWzLdzJJPL7C0OwitC93CQNoDJgDNdGuqzkY2bbqCQN9MhvStaifZaVP0aI4GxRMIyQgmvG61ptwy33QKFMQlDI2C1MNvvmuEYV6V59-h09LKrPZLTJ_fNYgNFRnK6qXARdqjeKrON3wa_udt6ZKftU4qgvoGL40G2jQmEnoT_L5yPiQm8mXBFr_ctDuKiA7d4MTZKnNDWn&__tn__=-R\">Facebook page</a>.</p>\n<p>Hess told WFTX she's trying to warn other parents about such videos.</p>\n<p>&quot;I believe this cartoon was up for about six months prior to it coming down,&quot; she told the station.</p>\n<h3>What happened to the video?</h3>\n<p>It's hard to say what happened to the video, as it appears to have been taken down and re-uploaded numerous times.</p>\n<p>As recently as Sunday, Hess noted on her Facebook page that she recorded a version of the clip &quot;directly from YouTube Kids&quot; that very afternoon. YouTube told WFTX the video violates its community guidelines, and a spokesperson said in part, &quot;We work hard to ensure YouTube is not used to encourage dangerous behavior, and we have strict policies that prohibit videos which promote self-harm.&quot;</p>\n<p>More from the Post:</p>\n<blockquote> Earlier this month, she found a second one &mdash; this time on YouTube.com.

                "text": "A Florida pediatrician found a suicide tip spliced in the middle of a video posted to the YouTube Kids app, WFTX-TV reported.\nThe clip is of a popular Nintendo game called Splatoon, CBS News said \u2014 except for an unrelated portion in the middle showing a person saying, \"Remember kids, sideways for attention, longways for results. End it.\"\nAccording to the Washington Post, the person appeared to be holding an imaginary blade to the inside of his arm. His \"longways\" motion went from the bottom of his hand and down his forearm toward his elbow.\nMore from CBS News:\nThe man featured is YouTuber Filthy Frank, who has over 6.2 million subscribers and calls himself \"the embodiment of everything a person should not be,\" although there is no evidence that Frank, whose real name is George Miller, was involved in creating the doctored video. He did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.\nDr. Free Hess of Gainesville posted the video on her PediMom Facebook page.\nHess told WFTX she's trying to warn other parents about such videos.\n\"I believe this cartoon was up for about six months prior to it coming down,\" she told the station.\nWhat happened to the video?\nIt's hard to say what happened to the video, as it appears to have been taken down and re-uploaded numerous times.\nAs recently as Sunday, Hess noted on her Facebook page that she recorded a version of the clip \"directly from YouTube Kids\" that very afternoon. YouTube told WFTX the video violates its community guidelines, and a spokesperson said in part, \"We work hard to ensure YouTube is not used to encourage dangerous behavior, and we have strict policies that prohibit videos which promote self-harm.\"\nMore from the Post:\nEarlier this month, she found a second one \u2014 this time on YouTube.com. She recorded it, wrote about it, and reported the content to the video-sharing platform, she said. The video was taken down.\nAnother version was reposted Feb. 12, receiving more than 1,000 views before it, too, was removed from the site.\nYouTube Kids is meant as a kid-friendly version of YouTube for children 8 years old and under, CBS News said, but trolls have founds ways around YouTube's algorithm and are posting the potentially harmful videos.\nA mission\nHess added to CBS News that she made it her mission to bring awareness to disturbing and violent content children consume on social media after seeing higher rates of suicide in children in her own emergency room over the last few years.\nShe told the network Friday that she found and reported seven more disturbing videos on YouTube Kids \u2014 including two Minecraft videos depicting shootings, a cartoon that suggests human trafficking, a clip about a child who committed suicide by stabbing, and another video about a girl who attempted suicide by hanging.\n\"I had to stop, but I could have kept going,\" Hess told CBS News. \"Once you start looking into it, things get darker and weirder. I don't understand how it's not getting caught.\"\nAny suggestions?\nThere are parental controls available on YouTube, WXFT said, adding that users can report or flag inappropriate content as well as video potential dangerous to kids.\n\"But we have to start doing something NOW and we should start by educating ourselves, educating our children, and speaking up when we see something that is dangerous for our children,\" Hess added on her PediMom blog. \"We also need to fight to have the developers of social media platforms held responsible when they do not assure that age restrictions are followed and when they do not remove inappropriate and/or dangerous material when reported.\"",

We're talking about organizations that I believe have, in fact, decided as organizations that Donald J. Trump is bad for the United States.&quot;</p>\n<p>Koppel added that &quot;we have things appearing on the front page of the New York Times right now that <em>never </em>would have appeared 50 years ago. Analysis, commentary <em>on the front page</em>.&quot;</p>\n<p>The legendary anchor recalled the infamous Trump &quot;grab them by the p***y&quot; audio hitting the news cycle a month before the 2016 election and told the audience, &quot;I will not offend any of you here by using the language, but you know exactly what words were used, and they were <em>spelled out</em> on the front page of the New York Times. I turned to my wife and I said, 'The Times is absolutely committed to making sure that this guy does not get elected.'&quot;</p>\n<p>More from Koppel:</p>\n<blockquote> So [Trump's] perception that the establishment press is out to get him &mdash; doesn't mean that great journalism is not being done; it is &mdash; but the notion that most of us look upon Donald Trump as being an absolute fiasco, he's not mistaken in that perception. And he's not mistaken when so many of the liberal media, for example, describe themselves as belonging to &quot;the resistance&quot;? What does that mean? That's not said by people who consider themselves reporters, objective reporters of facts. That's the kind of language that's used by people who genuinely believe &mdash; and rather suspect with some justification &mdash; that Donald Trump is bad for the United States ... and the sooner he's out of office the better they will like it. </blockquote>\n<h3>'Not the reservoir of objectivity'<br> </h3>\n<p>Koppel added to Kalb that &quot;we are not the reservoir of objectivity that I think we were.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kalb &mdash; whose book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Enemy-People-McCarthyism-American-Democracy/dp/0815735308/\">&quot;Enemy of the People: Trump's War on the Press, the New McCarthyism, and the Threat to American Democracy&quot;</a> was the subject of the discussion &mdash; disagreed with Koppel.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/41s12Uwb3mU?enablejsapi=1\"> </iframe></figure>\n<h3>Remember?</h3>\n<p>This wasn't the first time Koppel took aim at the mainstream media.

We're talking about organizations that I believe have, in fact, decided as organizations that Donald J. Trump is bad for the United States.\"\nKoppel added that \"we have things appearing on the front page of the New York Times right now that never would have appeared 50 years ago. Analysis, commentary on the front page.\"\nThe legendary anchor recalled the infamous Trump \"grab them by the p***y\" audio hitting the news cycle a month before the 2016 election and told the audience, \"I will not offend any of you here by using the language, but you know exactly what words were used, and they were spelled out on the front page of the New York Times. I turned to my wife and I said, 'The Times is absolutely committed to making sure that this guy does not get elected.'\"\nMore from Koppel:\nSo [Trump's] perception that the establishment press is out to get him \u2014 doesn't mean that great journalism is not being done; it is \u2014 but the notion that most of us look upon Donald Trump as being an absolute fiasco, he's not mistaken in that perception. And he's not mistaken when so many of the liberal media, for example, describe themselves as belonging to \"the resistance\"? What does that mean? That's not said by people who consider themselves reporters, objective reporters of facts. That's the kind of language that's used by people who genuinely believe \u2014 and rather suspect with some justification \u2014 that Donald Trump is bad for the United States ... and the sooner he's out of office the better they will like it.\n'Not the reservoir of objectivity'\nKoppel added to Kalb that \"we are not the reservoir of objectivity that I think we were.\"\nKalb \u2014 whose book \"Enemy of the People: Trump's War on the Press, the New McCarthyism, and the Threat to American Democracy\" was the subject of the discussion \u2014 disagreed with Koppel.\nRemember?\nThis wasn't the first time Koppel took aim at the mainstream media. In October, Koppel told CNN's Brian Stelter that his network's ratings \"would be in the toilet without Donald Trump\" \u2014 after which Stelter became quite annoyed.\n(H/T: Louder With Crowder)",
