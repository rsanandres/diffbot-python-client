Mr Trump&rsquo;s latest attempt to derail his own prosecution is not going at all well. But rather than recap the many tribulations of Trump&rsquo;s putative Acting Attorney General &ndash; whether Whitaker&rsquo;s appointment is even legal is being questioned &ndash; here are some key points on Mueller&rsquo;s endgame:</p>\n<ul><li>Mueller&rsquo;s next indictments may not be for Russian collusion</li><li>Why he may reveal all indictments on the substance over a day or two</li><li>There are dozens of indictments, with the number ranging from 30 to over a hundred</li><li>We report that Trump is indicted, but the indictments we describe are not for collusion with Russia in the election &ndash; such indictments may also exist but we have no knowledge of that, either way</li><li>Mike Pence, sources say, will not become President; </li><li>Chatter is that Roger Stone, Michael Cohen and Donald Trump Jr&rsquo;s time in the barrel is coming, but that chatter has been around for at least one month at time of writing </li><li>Nobody knows when Mueller will release the Red, White And Blue Wave of indictments on the substance (<em>but it will be awesome when he does) </em></li></ul>\n<h4>The First Indictments May Not Be for Russian Collusion</h4>\n<p>We could see Donald J. Trump Jr being indicted for lying to the FBI over the meeting he arranged with Russian Intelligence operative Natalia Vetselkinaya. We might see Tad Devine or Tony Podesta indicted for failing to register under FARA for Ukraine. We might even see Jared Kushner indicted over false declarations on his SF-86, including <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/jared-kushner-security-clearance-form-684590\">omitting</a> his attendance at the Trump Tower meeting between Don and the Kremlin, or for lying to the FBI.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even after initial revisions, the form failed to include a June 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya he attended at Trump Tower accompanied by Donald Trump Jr. and Trump&rsquo;s campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Mueller&rsquo;s pattern has been to indict Americans only on these ancillary offenses, and a great many mainstream journalists have taken this to mean that Mueller does not see any collusion with Russia. Blake Hounsell, the editor of Politico, published &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/18/confessions-of-a-russiagate-skeptic-217024\">Confessions of a Russiagate Skeptic</a>&lsquo; making this point about every indictment thus far.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, noted after the deal became public, prosecutors usually prefer to charge participants in a conspiracy with charges related to the underlying crime. &hellip;Flynn pleaded guilty only to lying to the FBI, which Bharara surmised that might mean Mueller didn&rsquo;t have much on him</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hounsell later published &lsquo;Why I&rsquo;m No Longer a Russiagate Skeptic&rsquo; but the title did not match the text; in the later piece, he insists again that Trump only *wanted* to collude:</p>\n<blockquote><p> There were certainly sporadic, repeated attempts by some on or around the campaign to collaborate, but we don&rsquo;t know if, or how, those flirtations were consummated&hellip;. We might never get clear evidence that Trump made a secret deal with the Kremlin. It would be great to see his tax returns, and perhaps Mueller has evidence of private collusion that we have yet to see</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is, of course, nonsense that downplays all the public evidence we have so far; Donald Trump Jr met with people billing themselves as coming from the Russian government and offering dirt on Clinton. Jared Kushner asked the Russian Ambassador for a digital &lsquo;backchannel&rsquo; <em>inside the Russian embassy </em> while Obama was still President. Carter Page announced Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State in Moscow before Trump announced him to America &ndash; and he was under a FISA warrant when he did so. The NRA took an extra $100m in cash in the 2016 cycle and gave it to the GOP, with Maria Butina being indicted.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s children and surrogates colluded with Assange and Wikileaks directly. Erik Prince, Flynn and Kushner arranged a &lsquo;backchannel&rsquo; meeting in the Seychelles with a representative of the Russian government. The FBI is continuing to investigate the Trump-Alfa server. The CIA blocked Kushner from a TS/SCI clearance. The ousted KT McFarland wrote to Mike Flynn that Russia had &lsquo;just elected Trump&rsquo;. All of these things, just the headlines, indeed, illustrate ample collusion with the Russian state. Guccifer 2 was the GRU, using a pun; Trump&rsquo;s collaboration with Peter Thiel&rsquo;s MAGA 3X memetic warfare pac, coordinated with the GRU, was openly tweeted; and so on and so forth.</p>\n<p><em>If you enjoy Patribotics, please <strong>consider a <a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\">donation here </a>. </strong>We need your help to keep going!</em></p>\n<p>Hounsell&rsquo;s tosh about &lsquo;sporadic&rsquo; collaboration, some variant of &lsquo;sure they wanted to collaborate, but did they?&rsquo; has been everywhere in American media. &ldquo;Roger Stone Sold Himself To Trump&rsquo;s Campaign As a Wikileaks Pipeline. Was He?&rdquo; said the New York Times. &ldquo;Page hasn&rsquo;t been accused of any wrongdoing&rdquo;, wrote the Washington Post, <em>after</em> it was known that Carter Page was the subject of a FISA warrant, confirming that a judge agreed Page might be an agent of a foreign power. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/opinion/trump-russia-mueller-election.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region\">Clint Watts</a>, a former FBI agent whose expertise was in counterterrorism and not counterintelligence, testified to Congress that Trump was a mere &ldquo;useful idiot&rdquo; who had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/selectedwisdom/status/855559530473807873\">only unwittingly</a> collaborated with Russia.</p>\n<p>(In forthcoming days, Patribotics will review the case against Trump, including pointers the mainstream media have omitted to cover.)</p>\n<h4>Why Won&rsquo;t Mueller&rsquo;s First Indictments Be for Russian Collusion? Isn&rsquo;t That What He&rsquo;s Looking For? And When Will He Get to the Main Event?</h4>\n<p>This is much more simple than the &lsquo;because he&rsquo;s got bupkis&rsquo; theory advanced by Mr. Hounsell and co. The indictments for Russian collusion are of Donald Trump and members of his campaign. They were coordinated between members of the campaign staff and the Trump family. Mueller cannot reveal one case on Russian collusion without effectively unsealing many others. It is likely, therefore, that over a single day, or a couple of days, Mueller&rsquo;s office will reveal all the indictments on the substance in a single day.</p>\n<h4>How Many Indictments Are There?</h4>\n<p>Last fall, this blog broke the news that Mueller had <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2017/10/29/exclusive-mueller-has-dozens-of-sealed-indictments-including-on-donald-trump/\">&lsquo;dozens of sealed indictments&rsquo;</a>. This week, John Schindler, speaking to separate intelligence sources &ndash; although we do not know who each other&rsquo;s sources are, his description of his sources does not match the role played by mine &ndash; <a href=\"https://observer.com/2018/11/mueller-holding-dozens-sealed-indictments-intel-source/\">confirmed </a>that Mueller has &lsquo;dozens of sealed indictments&rsquo; and I presume that now this has risen to substantively above what I reported. At that time, sources described a touch over two dozen sealed indictments but were not specific. The same sources later said there were &lsquo;plenty more&rsquo; after my story was published. Sources did not specify a number. My guess is that it will be close to a hundred, if not more, but the only thing I know for sure is that there are many more indictments than 24, with the language used by sources suggesting at minimum over 30.</p>\n<h4>Is Donald Trump Indicted For Colluding With Russia?</h4>\n<p>I am not sure. The at least three counts against him in indictments I report on this blog are <em>not</em> for collusion with Russia in the election, and were obtained either before Mueller was appointed, or just afterwards. One of those is for RICO, with the Trump Organization and Felix Sater over the Bayrock case. The other at least two counts were for an entirely separate offense. While I know what this offense is, sources will not presently allow me to report it; it is not strictly about actions taken with Russia, nor is it a sexual offense.</p>\n<p>I would happily bet many imaginary rubles that Mr. Trump will be indicted on some offenses of collusion with Russia &ndash; collusion is not a specific crime, but the term covers a whole range crimes committed while colluding, such as espionage, seditious conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, failing to register under FARA, misprision of a felony, election offenses, etc. However, I have no sourcing that Trump is indicted on these charges and am unlikely to get any; the closer we get to showtime, the less sources want to talk.</p>\n<p>Trump may be indicted or in trouble for his payoff to Stormy Daniels, a case pursued by Michael Avenatti, but it is unlikely that this would be allowed to interfere with the Russia investigation. Revealing openly that the President can be indicted for such a minor matter &ndash; at least in comparison &ndash; as paying off a woman with campaign funds &ndash; would impact reporting on the more serious sealed indictments against Trump. For that reason I doubt it will happen before the main Russia cases are unsealed &ndash; but of course that could be wrong.</p>\n<h4>Will Mike Pence be President?</h4>\n<p>Sources said last year that Pence is likely to be indicted on a scandal that happened while he was the Governor of Indiana. They refused to say whether or not he would also be indicted for colluding with Russia, but, last year, these sources said that they did not expect Pence to become President. He would resign, in return for consideration in regards to his case. However, Pence might insist upon it until he is convicted, raising constitutional questions similar to those surrounding Whitaker; could Pence swear the Oath of Office in good faith given what will be revealed about the Trump campaign of which he was a part?</p>\n<h4>Will Nancy Pelosi become the first woman President? </h4>\n<p>No, not technically unless she runs for the office. The Constitution mandates that the Speaker of the House becomes <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/19\">Acting President </a>(not President) if both the President and the Vice-President are removed. Speaker Pelosi has said that she does not plan to serve long in her second bite of the Congressional Apple. Trump is expected to fight his impeachment, not because he thinks he can get out of it, sources say, but because it is literally the only play he has left. Impeachment in the House will not be immediate and then the trial in the Senate will take its time. It is possible that Pelosi might succeed as Acting President before 2020, and if not her, then her successor as Speaker.</p>\n<p>One very interesting wrinkle in the law as I read it is that the line of succession to the Presidency (after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seniority_in_the_United_States_Senate\">President </a><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seniority_in_the_United_States_Senate\">Pro Tem </a></em>of the Senate) is in control of the Democratic House when it comes to impeachment. The line of succession eligible to assume the acting Presidency shall apply&hellip;&hellip;</p>\n<blockquote><p>only to officers not under impeachment by the House of Representatives at the time the powers and duties of the office of President devolve upon them</p></blockquote>\n<p>That would, if I read it correctly, mean that a Democratic House anticipating Trump&rsquo;s removal after conviction by the Senate could, should Speaker Pelosi not wish to assume the office, impeach others implicated in Russian collusion, such as Pompeo and Mnuchin, without needing their impeachment confirmed by the Senate. The next in line would be Jim Mattis, the Secretary of Defense.</p>\n<h4>When Will the Indictments Be Unsealed?</h4>\n<p>Anybody who claims to know is lying, unless they are suspects and have been directly informed by the FBI or the Office of the Special Counsel. It is clear from public reporting that Don Trump Junior thinks he will be indicted. There has been chatter for some time that an indictment of Roger Stone is forthcoming. As discussed above, these indictments may well not be earth-shattering, but for minor offenses only tangentially related to the Russia investigation. Mueller&rsquo;s team is prepared for, sources told me last year, &lsquo;at least three years&rsquo; of indictments coming not merely for Trump, his three eldest children, Jared Kushner and the rest of his campaign colluders, but also for Americans who knowingly worked with Russia to influence an election. The cost of Mueller&rsquo;s investigation will be huge.</p>\n<p>Mueller is not likely to want to be seen as partisan or as making a statement. If the &lsquo;Red, White, and Blue Wave&rsquo; of major Trump Russia indictments does not come very soon, then it must be likely the OSC will hold it until next year. We can expect some major name fireworks from conspirators who are not Americans &ndash; look for Julian Assange to be expelled from the Ecuadorean Embassy, and held on no bail in one of Her Majesty&rsquo;s most unpleasant prisons. For the same reasons as outlined in this piece, the UK&rsquo;s domestic-facing intelligence service MI5 (James Bond is MI6) is likely to hold back on what they know of Assange&rsquo;s work with Russia in the first instance, as the details of any espionage prosecution would reveal details of cases and indictments that Mueller is keeping under seal. Sources also say that the proof that Michael Cohen <em>was</em> in Prague is close to being given to journalists trusted by NATO intelligence. We will report more on this in another story.</p>\n<p>Please support us with a donation if you can!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/\">Patribotics</a> </strong>hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers.

                "text": "America had barely a morning to digest dramatic Democrat successes before Donald Trump fired Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, and appointed his Chief of Staff Matt Whitaker, a foe of the Russia probe. Mr Trump\u2019s latest attempt to derail his own prosecution is not going at all well. But rather than recap the many tribulations of Trump\u2019s putative Acting Attorney General \u2013 whether Whitaker\u2019s appointment is even legal is being questioned \u2013 here are some key points on Mueller\u2019s endgame:\nMueller\u2019s next indictments may not be for Russian collusion\nWhy he may reveal all indictments on the substance over a day or two\nThere are dozens of indictments, with the number ranging from 30 to over a hundred\nWe report that Trump is indicted, but the indictments we describe are not for collusion with Russia in the election \u2013 such indictments may also exist but we have no knowledge of that, either way\nMike Pence, sources say, will not become President;\nChatter is that Roger Stone, Michael Cohen and Donald Trump Jr\u2019s time in the barrel is coming, but that chatter has been around for at least one month at time of writing\nNobody knows when Mueller will release the Red, White And Blue Wave of indictments on the substance (but it will be awesome when he does)\nThe First Indictments May Not Be for Russian Collusion\nWe could see Donald J. Trump Jr being indicted for lying to the FBI over the meeting he arranged with Russian Intelligence operative Natalia Vetselkinaya. We might see Tad Devine or Tony Podesta indicted for failing to register under FARA for Ukraine. We might even see Jared Kushner indicted over false declarations on his SF-86, including omitting his attendance at the Trump Tower meeting between Don and the Kremlin, or for lying to the FBI.\nEven after initial revisions, the form failed to include a June 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya he attended at Trump Tower accompanied by Donald Trump Jr. and Trump\u2019s campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort.\nMueller\u2019s pattern has been to indict Americans only on these ancillary offenses, and a great many mainstream journalists have taken this to mean that Mueller does not see any collusion with Russia. Blake Hounsell, the editor of Politico, published \u2018Confessions of a Russiagate Skeptic\u2018 making this point about every indictment thus far.\nAs Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, noted after the deal became public, prosecutors usually prefer to charge participants in a conspiracy with charges related to the underlying crime. \u2026Flynn pleaded guilty only to lying to the FBI, which Bharara surmised that might mean Mueller didn\u2019t have much on him\nHounsell later published \u2018Why I\u2019m No Longer a Russiagate Skeptic\u2019 but the title did not match the text; in the later piece, he insists again that Trump only *wanted* to collude:\nThere were certainly sporadic, repeated attempts by some on or around the campaign to collaborate, but we don\u2019t know if, or how, those flirtations were consummated\u2026. We might never get clear evidence that Trump made a secret deal with the Kremlin. It would be great to see his tax returns, and perhaps Mueller has evidence of private collusion that we have yet to see\nThis is, of course, nonsense that downplays all the public evidence we have so far; Donald Trump Jr met with people billing themselves as coming from the Russian government and offering dirt on Clinton. Jared Kushner asked the Russian Ambassador for a digital \u2018backchannel\u2019 inside the Russian embassy while Obama was still President. Carter Page announced Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State in Moscow before Trump announced him to America \u2013 and he was under a FISA warrant when he did so. The NRA took an extra $100m in cash in the 2016 cycle and gave it to the GOP, with Maria Butina being indicted.\nTrump\u2019s children and surrogates colluded with Assange and Wikileaks directly. Erik Prince, Flynn and Kushner arranged a \u2018backchannel\u2019 meeting in the Seychelles with a representative of the Russian government. The FBI is continuing to investigate the Trump-Alfa server. The CIA blocked Kushner from a TS/SCI clearance. The ousted KT McFarland wrote to Mike Flynn that Russia had \u2018just elected Trump\u2019. All of these things, just the headlines, indeed, illustrate ample collusion with the Russian state. Guccifer 2 was the GRU, using a pun; Trump\u2019s collaboration with Peter Thiel\u2019s MAGA 3X memetic warfare pac, coordinated with the GRU, was openly tweeted; and so on and so forth.\nIf you enjoy Patribotics, please consider a donation here . We need your help to keep going!\nHounsell\u2019s tosh about \u2018sporadic\u2019 collaboration, some variant of \u2018sure they wanted to collaborate, but did they?\u2019 has been everywhere in American media. \u201cRoger Stone Sold Himself To Trump\u2019s Campaign As a Wikileaks Pipeline. Was He?\u201d said the New York Times. \u201cPage hasn\u2019t been accused of any wrongdoing\u201d, wrote the Washington Post, after it was known that Carter Page was the subject of a FISA warrant, confirming that a judge agreed Page might be an agent of a foreign power. Clint Watts, a former FBI agent whose expertise was in counterterrorism and not counterintelligence, testified to Congress that Trump was a mere \u201cuseful idiot\u201d who had only unwittingly collaborated with Russia.\n(In forthcoming days, Patribotics will review the case against Trump, including pointers the mainstream media have omitted to cover.)\nWhy Won\u2019t Mueller\u2019s First Indictments Be for Russian Collusion? Isn\u2019t That What He\u2019s Looking For? And When Will He Get to the Main Event?\nThis is much more simple than the \u2018because he\u2019s got bupkis\u2019 theory advanced by Mr. Hounsell and co. The indictments for Russian collusion are of Donald Trump and members of his campaign. They were coordinated between members of the campaign staff and the Trump family. Mueller cannot reveal one case on Russian collusion without effectively unsealing many others. It is likely, therefore, that over a single day, or a couple of days, Mueller\u2019s office will reveal all the indictments on the substance in a single day.\nHow Many Indictments Are There?\nLast fall, this blog broke the news that Mueller had \u2018dozens of sealed indictments\u2019. This week, John Schindler, speaking to separate intelligence sources \u2013 although we do not know who each other\u2019s sources are, his description of his sources does not match the role played by mine \u2013 confirmed that Mueller has \u2018dozens of sealed indictments\u2019 and I presume that now this has risen to substantively above what I reported. At that time, sources described a touch over two dozen sealed indictments but were not specific. The same sources later said there were \u2018plenty more\u2019 after my story was published. Sources did not specify a number. My guess is that it will be close to a hundred, if not more, but the only thing I know for sure is that there are many more indictments than 24, with the language used by sources suggesting at minimum over 30.\nIs Donald Trump Indicted For Colluding With Russia?\nI am not sure. The at least three counts against him in indictments I report on this blog are not for collusion with Russia in the election, and were obtained either before Mueller was appointed, or just afterwards. One of those is for RICO, with the Trump Organization and Felix Sater over the Bayrock case. The other at least two counts were for an entirely separate offense. While I know what this offense is, sources will not presently allow me to report it; it is not strictly about actions taken with Russia, nor is it a sexual offense.\nI would happily bet many imaginary rubles that Mr. Trump will be indicted on some offenses of collusion with Russia \u2013 collusion is not a specific crime, but the term covers a whole range crimes committed while colluding, such as espionage, seditious conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, failing to register under FARA, misprision of a felony, election offenses, etc. However, I have no sourcing that Trump is indicted on these charges and am unlikely to get any; the closer we get to showtime, the less sources want to talk.\nTrump may be indicted or in trouble for his payoff to Stormy Daniels, a case pursued by Michael Avenatti, but it is unlikely that this would be allowed to interfere with the Russia investigation. Revealing openly that the President can be indicted for such a minor matter \u2013 at least in comparison \u2013 as paying off a woman with campaign funds \u2013 would impact reporting on the more serious sealed indictments against Trump. For that reason I doubt it will happen before the main Russia cases are unsealed \u2013 but of course that could be wrong.\nWill Mike Pence be President?\nSources said last year that Pence is likely to be indicted on a scandal that happened while he was the Governor of Indiana. They refused to say whether or not he would also be indicted for colluding with Russia, but, last year, these sources said that they did not expect Pence to become President. He would resign, in return for consideration in regards to his case. However, Pence might insist upon it until he is convicted, raising constitutional questions similar to those surrounding Whitaker; could Pence swear the Oath of Office in good faith given what will be revealed about the Trump campaign of which he was a part?\nWill Nancy Pelosi become the first woman President?\nNo, not technically unless she runs for the office. The Constitution mandates that the Speaker of the House becomes Acting President (not President) if both the President and the Vice-President are removed. Speaker Pelosi has said that she does not plan to serve long in her second bite of the Congressional Apple. Trump is expected to fight his impeachment, not because he thinks he can get out of it, sources say, but because it is literally the only play he has left. Impeachment in the House will not be immediate and then the trial in the Senate will take its time. It is possible that Pelosi might succeed as Acting President before 2020, and if not her, then her successor as Speaker.\nOne very interesting wrinkle in the law as I read it is that the line of succession to the Presidency (after the President Pro Tem of the Senate) is in control of the Democratic House when it comes to impeachment. The line of succession eligible to assume the acting Presidency shall apply\u2026\u2026\nonly to officers not under impeachment by the House of Representatives at the time the powers and duties of the office of President devolve upon them\nThat would, if I read it correctly, mean that a Democratic House anticipating Trump\u2019s removal after conviction by the Senate could, should Speaker Pelosi not wish to assume the office, impeach others implicated in Russian collusion, such as Pompeo and Mnuchin, without needing their impeachment confirmed by the Senate. The next in line would be Jim Mattis, the Secretary of Defense.\nWhen Will the Indictments Be Unsealed?\nAnybody who claims to know is lying, unless they are suspects and have been directly informed by the FBI or the Office of the Special Counsel. It is clear from public reporting that Don Trump Junior thinks he will be indicted. There has been chatter for some time that an indictment of Roger Stone is forthcoming. As discussed above, these indictments may well not be earth-shattering, but for minor offenses only tangentially related to the Russia investigation. Mueller\u2019s team is prepared for, sources told me last year, \u2018at least three years\u2019 of indictments coming not merely for Trump, his three eldest children, Jared Kushner and the rest of his campaign colluders, but also for Americans who knowingly worked with Russia to influence an election. The cost of Mueller\u2019s investigation will be huge.\nMueller is not likely to want to be seen as partisan or as making a statement. If the \u2018Red, White, and Blue Wave\u2019 of major Trump Russia indictments does not come very soon, then it must be likely the OSC will hold it until next year. We can expect some major name fireworks from conspirators who are not Americans \u2013 look for Julian Assange to be expelled from the Ecuadorean Embassy, and held on no bail in one of Her Majesty\u2019s most unpleasant prisons. For the same reasons as outlined in this piece, the UK\u2019s domestic-facing intelligence service MI5 (James Bond is MI6) is likely to hold back on what they know of Assange\u2019s work with Russia in the first instance, as the details of any espionage prosecution would reveal details of cases and indictments that Mueller is keeping under seal. Sources also say that the proof that Michael Cohen was in Prague is close to being given to journalists trusted by NATO intelligence. We will report more on this in another story.\nPlease support us with a donation if you can!\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers.

Please consider a </em><a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\">donation</a><em><a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\"> here</a></em></h4>\n<p>Based on today&rsquo;s sentencing memos, the answers would seem to be &lsquo;maybe&rsquo; and &lsquo;no&rsquo; respectively. The SDNY memo discusses how Michael Cohen has withheld information. Here are the relevant paragraphs:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To be clear, neither the SCO nor this Office is making a motion under U.S.S.G. &sect; 5K1.1. No such motion is being made because, as detailed herein, Cohen repeatedly declined to provide full information about the scope of any additional criminal conduct in which he may have engaged or had knowledge. </p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Indeed, his proffer sessions with the SCO aside, Cohen only met with the Office about the participation of others in the campaign finance crimes to which Cohen had already pleaded guilty. <em>Cohen specifically declined to be debriefed on other uncharged criminal conduct, if any, in his past</em>. Cohen further declined to meet with the Office about other areas of investigative interest.</p><p>As the Court is undoubtedly aware, in order to successfully cooperate with this Office, witnesses must undergo full debriefings that encompass their entire criminal history, as well as any and all information they possess about crimes committed by both themselves and others&hellip;. Cohen affirmatively chose not to pursue this process.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The sentencing memo makes clear the SDNY&rsquo;s belief that Cohen only admits his guilt once he knows his criminal conduct is already established.</p>\n<p>Cohen has maintained he did not go to Prague, to discuss paying hackers. Yet, Mr. Cohen and those in his immediate orbit seemed scared that Mueller will find this out, too. His adult daughter Samantha, whose Instagram Mr. Cohen told journalists to examine for proof he was in LA, has now deleted her Instagram account.</p>\n<p>In February 2017, Patribotics reported that <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2017/02/26/planespotting-michael-cohens-amazing-journey-louise-mensch/\">Michael Cohen&rsquo;s denial</a> that he could possibly have gone to Prague, as the Steele Dossier asserted, was false. Although we could not absolutely assert from open source evidence that Mr. Cohen went to Prague, with the help of an army of citizen journalists researching on Twitter, we did manage to show that Cohen had lied about when he was in Los Angeles, and that private planes on which he habitually traveled were engaged in deceptive practice, apparently designed to conceal their movements from an observer.</p>\n<p>On April 18 of this year, McClatchy&rsquo;s well-known and respected national security correspondents Peter Stone and Greg Gordon <a href=\"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article208870264.html\">reported</a> that Special Counsel Bob Mueller had evidence that Cohen went to Prague, to meet and pay hackers working for Russia (who may, per the dossier, have had other nationalities) on behalf of the Trump campaign. That story said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>investigators have traced evidence that Cohen entered the Czech Republic through Germany, apparently during August or early September of 2016 as the ex-spy reported<strong>,</strong> said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is confidential. He wouldn&rsquo;t have needed a passport for such a trip, because both countries are in the so-called Schengen Area in which 26 nations operate with open borders. The disclosure still left a puzzle: The sources did not say whether Cohen took a commercial flight or private jet to Europe, and gave no explanation as to why no record of such a trip has surfaced.<br> &hellip;.</p><p>However, Democratic investigators for the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, which are conducting parallel inquiries into Russia&rsquo;s election interference, also are skeptical about whether Cohen was truthful about his 2016 travels to Europe when he was interviewed by the panels last October, two people familiar with those probes told McClatchy this week. </p><p>&hellip;..<br></p><p>One of the sources said congressional investigators have &ldquo;a high level of interest&rdquo; in Cohen&rsquo;s European travel, with their doubts fueled by what they deem to be weak documentation Cohen has provided about his whereabouts around the time the Prague meeting was supposed to have occurred.<br><em>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article208870264.html#storylink=cpy\">https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article208870264.html#storylink=cpy</a></em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Breaking this down, first, Gordon and Stone list sources familiar with Mueller&rsquo;s investigation; secondly, they adduce two sources and describe the House and Senate probes in terms that make me think those sources are one staffer on each probe. The line in the story that made me reopen my own reporting was this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>congressional investigators &hellip;.doubts fueled by what they deem to be weak documentation Cohen has provided about his whereabouts around the time the Prague meeting was supposed to have occurred.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now, &lsquo;supposed to have occurred&rsquo; means what the dossier asserts; the end of August and the beginning of September. That is where the McClatchy report meets our own story. Because it appears to imply that Mr. Cohen lied about the exact nature of his trip to Los Angeles. As we <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2017/02/26/planespotting-michael-cohens-amazing-journey-louise-mensch/\">reported</a>, Cohen<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/michael-cohen-it-is-fake-news-meant-to-malign-mr-trump/512762/\"> told </a>Rosie Gray of the Atlantic &ldquo;that he was in Los Angeles from the 23rd through the 29th of August&rdquo;. That was demonstrably false. On the 24th August, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/828820913214742530\">he was at Newark </a>Airport.</p>\n<p>Gray&rsquo;s piece also bore this odd framing: &ldquo;Cohen said that during the time the report places him in Prague, he was actually with his son visiting USC and meeting with the baseball coach. A USC baseball source confirmed Tuesday night that Cohen and his son had visited USC on August 29<sup>th</sup>. Cohen said that he was in Los Angeles from the 23rd through the 29th of August&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Confirmed&rdquo; is not the word I would have used. If Mr. Cohen said he was in Los Angeles &ldquo;meeting with the baseball coach&rdquo;, describing a key purpose of the trip, why did he only do so on the last day of that trip?</p>\n<p>Per McClatchy, Congressional investigators were not convinced that Mr. Cohen indeed was in Los Angeles for the entire time that he said he was. Perhaps they asked for credit card receipts or photographs. Perhaps some enterprising staffer read Patribotics, noted our reporting and saw the discrepancy between Cohen&rsquo;s 23-29 August dates and the tweet from 24th August.</p>\n<p>Considered in this way, Cohen&rsquo;s own word choice seems to indicate a great deal of nervousness about when he could be located in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>As noted in our first story, Cohen was very obviously keen for his passport to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; he hadn&rsquo;t been to Prague. He famously tweeted out the cover, then referred readers to a Buzzfeed story in which he had provided that passport to the reporters. &ldquo;If the glove doesn&rsquo;t fit, you must acquit&rdquo; was now adapted to &ldquo;No stamp on the page, no Mike in a cage&rdquo;. The lack of an entry stamp to Europe must mean an innocent Mr. Cohen. And yet, that was an obvious red herring; Cohen, by the dossier&rsquo;s account, had gone <em>secretly</em> to Prague, and Russian intelligence planes would be highly unlikely to file manifests, land at major airports, or obtain nice little &lsquo;Welcome to Moscow&rsquo; ink stamps for the FBI to pore over. He also repeatedly pointed to the meeting he had on the 29th. Cohen posted a photograph of himself at dinner on August 25th in Los Angeles, then his next geolocated tweet was August 28th at 1:53 pm from Beverley Hills.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s tweets also show an odd discrepancy. They are all geolocated for the period of time in question &ndash; apart from one tweet on August 26th. Why did Cohen make a point of turning off location services for t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/0neOfDem/status/985671805913485313\">hat day alone</a>?</p>\n<p>There is, thus, a gap in the public record from this very public man &ndash; from the night of August 25th to lunchtime on the 28th. Did he take a private plane from Los Angeles to Europe, to Germany as McClatchy reported? We are unlikely to find that out from open source intelligence. But it seems that this part of Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s story is what Congress is doubting &ndash; and from the sentencing memos passed down today by SDNY and the Special Counsel&rsquo;s office, Mr. Cohen may regret it bitterly if he is found to have held anything back.</p>\n<p>And yet perhaps &ldquo;Says Who&rdquo; has gotten too much attention, and others in Trump&rsquo;s orbit not enough. The Steele Dossier reported that Mr. Cohen had gone to Prague <em>accompanied by three colleagues.</em> In a special report tomorrow, Patribotics will examine open-source evidence on who might have joined Mr. Cohen in Prague to discuss how to hack the election.</p>\n<ul><li><figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.reddit.com/static/button/button1.html?newwindow=true&width=120&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpatribotics.blog%2F2018%2F12%2F07%2Fmichael-cohen-sentencing-still-lying-to-mueller-over-prague%2F&title=Michael%20Cohen%20Sentencing%3A%20Still%20Lying%20to%20Mueller%20Over%20Prague%3F\"></iframe></figure></li></ul>",

Your support helps us break stories and hold Trump and Russia to account. Please consider a donation here\nBased on today\u2019s sentencing memos, the answers would seem to be \u2018maybe\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 respectively. The SDNY memo discusses how Michael Cohen has withheld information. Here are the relevant paragraphs:\nTo be clear, neither the SCO nor this Office is making a motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. No such motion is being made because, as detailed herein, Cohen repeatedly declined to provide full information about the scope of any additional criminal conduct in which he may have engaged or had knowledge.\n\u2026\nIndeed, his proffer sessions with the SCO aside, Cohen only met with the Office about the participation of others in the campaign finance crimes to which Cohen had already pleaded guilty. Cohen specifically declined to be debriefed on other uncharged criminal conduct, if any, in his past. Cohen further declined to meet with the Office about other areas of investigative interest.\nAs the Court is undoubtedly aware, in order to successfully cooperate with this Office, witnesses must undergo full debriefings that encompass their entire criminal history, as well as any and all information they possess about crimes committed by both themselves and others\u2026. Cohen affirmatively chose not to pursue this process.\nThe sentencing memo makes clear the SDNY\u2019s belief that Cohen only admits his guilt once he knows his criminal conduct is already established.\nCohen has maintained he did not go to Prague, to discuss paying hackers. Yet, Mr. Cohen and those in his immediate orbit seemed scared that Mueller will find this out, too. His adult daughter Samantha, whose Instagram Mr. Cohen told journalists to examine for proof he was in LA, has now deleted her Instagram account.\nIn February 2017, Patribotics reported that Michael Cohen\u2019s denial that he could possibly have gone to Prague, as the Steele Dossier asserted, was false. Although we could not absolutely assert from open source evidence that Mr. Cohen went to Prague, with the help of an army of citizen journalists researching on Twitter, we did manage to show that Cohen had lied about when he was in Los Angeles, and that private planes on which he habitually traveled were engaged in deceptive practice, apparently designed to conceal their movements from an observer.\nOn April 18 of this year, McClatchy\u2019s well-known and respected national security correspondents Peter Stone and Greg Gordon reported that Special Counsel Bob Mueller had evidence that Cohen went to Prague, to meet and pay hackers working for Russia (who may, per the dossier, have had other nationalities) on behalf of the Trump campaign. That story said:\ninvestigators have traced evidence that Cohen entered the Czech Republic through Germany, apparently during August or early September of 2016 as the ex-spy reported, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is confidential. He wouldn\u2019t have needed a passport for such a trip, because both countries are in the so-called Schengen Area in which 26 nations operate with open borders. The disclosure still left a puzzle: The sources did not say whether Cohen took a commercial flight or private jet to Europe, and gave no explanation as to why no record of such a trip has surfaced.\n\u2026.\nHowever, Democratic investigators for the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, which are conducting parallel inquiries into Russia\u2019s election interference, also are skeptical about whether Cohen was truthful about his 2016 travels to Europe when he was interviewed by the panels last October, two people familiar with those probes told McClatchy this week.\n\u2026..\nOne of the sources said congressional investigators have \u201ca high level of interest\u201d in Cohen\u2019s European travel, with their doubts fueled by what they deem to be weak documentation Cohen has provided about his whereabouts around the time the Prague meeting was supposed to have occurred.\nRead more here: https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article208870264.html#storylink=cpy\nBreaking this down, first, Gordon and Stone list sources familiar with Mueller\u2019s investigation; secondly, they adduce two sources and describe the House and Senate probes in terms that make me think those sources are one staffer on each probe. The line in the story that made me reopen my own reporting was this:\ncongressional investigators \u2026.doubts fueled by what they deem to be weak documentation Cohen has provided about his whereabouts around the time the Prague meeting was supposed to have occurred.\nNow, \u2018supposed to have occurred\u2019 means what the dossier asserts; the end of August and the beginning of September. That is where the McClatchy report meets our own story. Because it appears to imply that Mr. Cohen lied about the exact nature of his trip to Los Angeles. As we reported, Cohen told Rosie Gray of the Atlantic \u201cthat he was in Los Angeles from the 23rd through the 29th of August\u201d. That was demonstrably false. On the 24th August, he was at Newark Airport.\nGray\u2019s piece also bore this odd framing: \u201cCohen said that during the time the report places him in Prague, he was actually with his son visiting USC and meeting with the baseball coach. A USC baseball source confirmed Tuesday night that Cohen and his son had visited USC on August 29th. Cohen said that he was in Los Angeles from the 23rd through the 29th of August\u201d\n\u201cConfirmed\u201d is not the word I would have used. If Mr. Cohen said he was in Los Angeles \u201cmeeting with the baseball coach\u201d, describing a key purpose of the trip, why did he only do so on the last day of that trip?\nPer McClatchy, Congressional investigators were not convinced that Mr. Cohen indeed was in Los Angeles for the entire time that he said he was. Perhaps they asked for credit card receipts or photographs. Perhaps some enterprising staffer read Patribotics, noted our reporting and saw the discrepancy between Cohen\u2019s 23-29 August dates and the tweet from 24th August.\nConsidered in this way, Cohen\u2019s own word choice seems to indicate a great deal of nervousness about when he could be located in Los Angeles.\nAs noted in our first story, Cohen was very obviously keen for his passport to \u201cprove\u201d he hadn\u2019t been to Prague. He famously tweeted out the cover, then referred readers to a Buzzfeed story in which he had provided that passport to the reporters. \u201cIf the glove doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit\u201d was now adapted to \u201cNo stamp on the page, no Mike in a cage\u201d. The lack of an entry stamp to Europe must mean an innocent Mr. Cohen. And yet, that was an obvious red herring; Cohen, by the dossier\u2019s account, had gone secretly to Prague, and Russian intelligence planes would be highly unlikely to file manifests, land at major airports, or obtain nice little \u2018Welcome to Moscow\u2019 ink stamps for the FBI to pore over. He also repeatedly pointed to the meeting he had on the 29th. Cohen posted a photograph of himself at dinner on August 25th in Los Angeles, then his next geolocated tweet was August 28th at 1:53 pm from Beverley Hills.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s tweets also show an odd discrepancy. They are all geolocated for the period of time in question \u2013 apart from one tweet on August 26th. Why did Cohen make a point of turning off location services for that day alone?\nThere is, thus, a gap in the public record from this very public man \u2013 from the night of August 25th to lunchtime on the 28th. Did he take a private plane from Los Angeles to Europe, to Germany as McClatchy reported? We are unlikely to find that out from open source intelligence. But it seems that this part of Mr. Cohen\u2019s story is what Congress is doubting \u2013 and from the sentencing memos passed down today by SDNY and the Special Counsel\u2019s office, Mr. Cohen may regret it bitterly if he is found to have held anything back.\nAnd yet perhaps \u201cSays Who\u201d has gotten too much attention, and others in Trump\u2019s orbit not enough. The Steele Dossier reported that Mr. Cohen had gone to Prague accompanied by three colleagues. In a special report tomorrow, Patribotics will examine open-source evidence on who might have joined Mr. Cohen in Prague to discuss how to hack the election.",

Donald Trump is gloating about this on Twitter this morning:</p>\n<p>The trouble Messers. Trump and Trump Jr have about this revelation is that Howard Lorber fits extremely neatly into what we know about Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation of the Trump campaign&rsquo;s collusion with the Russian state. A name not much floated in the mainstream press after 2016, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=from%3Aushadrons%20lorber&src=typd\">familiar</a> to followers of the citizen journalism research group #TeamPatriot on Twitter, Lorber was a major contributor to the &lsquo;Trump Victory&rsquo; Fund, and, more significantly, he was linked to Trump Moscow, and to Michael and Bryan Cohen.</p>\n<p>The best mainstream reporting we have on Lorber is Josh Rogin&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2016/08/10/another-trump-adviser-with-deep-ties-to-russia/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a3df326188cf\">piece</a> of August 2016 for the Washington Post. Rogin made it clear that that Lorber was tied to Russia in general and Trump Tower Moscow in particular. Rogin&rsquo;s piece also dwells on the fact that Lorber brought Trump to Russia as far back as 1996, and was an initial mover of the Trump Moscow project.</p>\n<p><em>Businessman and investor Howard Lorber </em><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/trumps-economic-advisers-are-also-his-biggest-donors-226758\"><em>already donated $100,000</em></a><em> to the Trump Victory fund, has been named as one of Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;</em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/business/economy/donald-trump-economic-team.html?_r=0\"><em>best friends</em></a><em>&rdquo; and even appeared once on &ldquo;The Apprentice.&rdquo; He is also president and chief executive of the Vector Group, a holding company that has various business interests in Russia. In 1996, Lorber brought Trump to Moscow to look for opportunities for Trump to lend his famous name to development projects there&hellip;.</em></p>\n<p><em>At that time, Trump and Lorber were discussing Trump building a huge luxury residential tower in Moscow as part of a project owned by a subsidiary of Lorber&rsquo;s firm. </em></p>\n<p>Michael Cohen&rsquo;s guilty plea of <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/28301de8eaa94cc796c5279fc28c1fdb\">lying to Congress about Trump Tower Moscow</a>, and Rudy Giuliani&rsquo;s disastrous <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-january-20-2019-n960731\">admission</a> that negotiations on the project had gone on &lsquo;until November&rsquo; of 2016, make the Lorber name, in connection with Don Jr, extraordinarily significant.</p>\n<p>The facts suggest that whatever Donald Trump Jr said to Mr. Lorber when he called him on this occasion, that the Russian meeting about offering dirt on Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign &ndash; part of the Russian government&rsquo;s support for Trump, as Don Jr was told &ndash; the call was placed to Lorber by Don Jr because Lorber was going to help <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/cohen-says-trump-stayed-involved-in-moscow-tower-project-during-campaign-1543539269\">launder Russian financial help</a> into the Trump campaign.</p>\n<p><em> Patribotics is grateful for the readers who make our reporting possible. Your support helps us break stories and analyze all the key events on Trump and Russia. Please consider a </em><strong>donation</strong><em> here</em></p>\n<p>When I broke the story that the FBI were investigating the Trump campaign on Nov 7th, 2016, I reported that the FISA was targeted on &lsquo;two Russian banks&rsquo; but covered &lsquo;any US person&rsquo; in relation to these specific activities. For that, one may read &lsquo;packet data&rsquo;, as what was being sent between the Trump Tower server and Alfa Bank involved US persons to do with the campaign. The warrants in some way also sought permission for the FBI to listen to &ldquo;intelligence provided by friendly foreign agencies&rdquo; on US persons, I reported.</p>\n<p>Both the Guardian and the BBC subsequently said that my accounts of the FISA warrant, and the turning down of James Comey&rsquo;s attempts in the summer to obtain a FISA warrant on Carter Page, Boris Epshteyn, and Paul Manafort, were correct. (The Guardian took two separate stories to do so; first they acknowledged that my account of the failed summer FISA applications on Trump campaign personnel was correct, and later, that my account of the granted FISA targeted on the two Russian banks was correct.)</p>\n<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Paul Wood <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38589427\">reported</a> in January 2017. His piece was much wider than my own. Here are some of the relevant passages:</p>\n<p><em>At the same time a joint taskforce, which includes the CIA and the FBI, has been investigating allegations that the Russians may have sent money to Mr Trump&rsquo;s organisation or his election campaign&hellip;.</em> <em>a joint intelligence and law enforcement taskforce has been looking at allegations that the Kremlin paid money to his campaign through his associates.</em></p>\n<p>Howard Lorber donated to Trump Victory; Howard Lorber was instrumental in Trump Tower Moscow.</p>\n<p>(This joint Taskforce was separately reported by McClatchyDC.)</p>\n<p>Wood&rsquo;s seminal piece continues:</p>\n<p><em>The former MI6 agent&rsquo;s report detailed alleged attempts by the Kremlin to offer Mr Trump lucrative &ldquo;sweetheart deals&rdquo; in Russia that would buy his loyalty.</em></p>\n<p>Again, this sounds much like Trump Tower Moscow, started by Howard Lorber, about which Michael Cohen pled guilty about lying to Congress?</p>\n<p><em>Last April, the CIA director was shown intelligence that worried him. It was &ndash; allegedly &ndash; a tape recording of a conversation about money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign.</em></p>\n<p>As I have reported, this intelligence was supplied by Estonia&rsquo;s world-class intelligence agency, Teabeamet. When the history of Trump Russia is eventually written, Teabeamet&rsquo;s role will loom large.</p>\n<p>Michael Cohen lied about Trump Tower Moscow, Howard Lorber started Trump Tower Moscow &ndash; surely real estate will be seen as a major vehicle by which Russia both laundered money <em>to </em>Trump and had its money laundered <em>by </em>Trump. Michael Cohen, according to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/michael-cohen-purchases-new-york-city-apartment-for-6-7-million-1531410460\">Wall Street Journal</a>, purchased an apartment he had no real means to buy while the developers &ndash; including Lorber &ndash; held the note:</p>\n<p><em>Michael Cohen, Donald Trump&rsquo;s former personal lawyer who is under federal investigation, bought a $6.7 million apartment in April in a new Manhattan skyscraper that is being developed by two of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s longtime friends, according to people familiar with the transaction.</em></p>\n<p><em>Located at 111 Murray Street in Manhattan&rsquo;s Tribeca neighborhood, the project is being developed by a partnership of real estate companies Fisher Brothers, Witkoff and New Valley. New Valley is headed by Howard Lorber, a real estate developer and longtime friend of Mr. Trump.</em></p>\n<p><em>Mr. Cohen financed the purchase by securing a $3.5 million short-term mortgage from the developers, rather than getting financing from a bank, according to public records. While developers occasionally offer to finance purchases in their projects, such developer financing is unusual in Manhattan, real-estate attorneys say.</em></p>\n<p>Howard Lorber defended Trump paying <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/05/real-estate-mogul-trump-as-successful-businessman-is-the-real-deal.html\">no taxes</a> in 2016. He was also singled out by Trump in his victory speech in his New York primary in April 2016 &ndash; exactly the time that Estonian intelligence were passing the &lsquo;money laundering&rsquo; tape to the director of the CIA.</p>\n<p>But there is more. Howard Lorber, according to reporting, is also involved with Douglas Elliman. (Yes, I know, I enjoy their listings too). Lorber&rsquo;s company Vector Group is the <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/2016/04/20/trump-gives-lorber-roth-shout-outs-in-victory-speech/\">parent company</a> of the famous real estate broker. Cohen&rsquo;s younger brother, Bryan, was <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/2018/08/17/meet-michael-cohens-brother-bryan-hes-an-elliman-executive-with-a-7m-connection-to-ukraine/\">reported</a> to have received $7m in payments after he started working for Elliman, and thereby Howard Lorber, from a Ukranian &ldquo;agribusiness. &ldquo;</p>\n<p>It was Bryan Cohen&rsquo;s father in law, Alex Oronov, who died after arranging Michael Cohen&rsquo;s meeting with Ukranian pro-Putin politician Andrey Artemenko and Felix Sater. Oronov was shown to have an apartment in Trump Hollywood. Buzzfeed News&rsquo;s Jason Leopold and Anthony Cormier <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonaleopold/a-suspicious-death-in-trumps-orbit-total-bullshit-says-famil\">rubbished the reporting</a> of Oronov&rsquo;s death as suspicious:</p>\n<p><em>Some </em><a href=\"https://www.palmerreport.com/opinion/trump-russia-conspirator-alex-oronov-dies-suspiciously-he-lived-in-donald-trumps-building/1786/\"><em>commentators</em></a><em> have drawn a link between Oronov and the president by noting that Oronov owns property in Trump Hollywood, a condo tower in South Florida. But the Trump Organization has no connection to sales in that development, which merely leases the Trump name.</em></p>\n<p>Sadly the Trump Organization <a href=\"https://www.trump.com/real-estate-portfolio/florida/trump-hollywood\">did not get the Leopold-Cormier memo</a>, as it quite literally lists Trump Hollywood as among its &lsquo;Real Estate Portfolio&rsquo;, devoting an entire page to it on the organisation&rsquo;s website.</p>\n<p>If the Trump Tower meeting was &lsquo;a bust&rsquo;, as NSA veteran John Schindler has argued &ndash; the Russian side expected a commitment on sanctions, Don Jr and Paul Manafort expected immediate dirt on Hillary Clinton &ndash; it makes no difference to the Trump-Russia prosecutorial path. The attempt to collude and intent to collude is what counts. A call placed by Don Jr to Howard Lorber on a blocked number fits the idea that Russia was offering incentives, including money laundering via Trump Tower Moscow. It fits the description in the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download\">GRU&rsquo;s indictment by Mueller </a>of multiple <em>failed attempts </em>to deliver the DNC emails to Wikileaks starting in June 2016:</p>\n<p><em>After failed attempts to transfer the stolen documents starting in late June 2016, on or about July 14, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, sent Organization 1 an email with an attachment titled &ldquo;wk dnc link1.txt.gpg.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>The Lorber-Cohen-Trump Moscow connection is extremely strong, and it ties <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/14/politics/donald-trump-jr-meeting/index.html\">Donald Trump Jr</a> directly to the events described in the Steele Dossier.</p>\n<p>It was reported that Spanish intelligence had intercepted Alexander Torshin&rsquo;s calls to the money launderer Alexander Romanov and &lsquo;Mr Trump&rsquo;s son&rsquo; &ldquo;should be concerned&rdquo;. While most reporting concentrated on the NRA donor and Russian agent Maria Butina&rsquo;s mentor Mr. Torshin, it is worth noting what Romanov was convicted of. His money laundering was done through property purchases &ndash; exactly what Mr. Lorber specializes in.</p>\n<p>If nothing of substance happened at the opening meeting, but Donald J Trump Jr believed he was going to get &ldquo;dirt on Clinton&rdquo; and Russia believed they were going to get &ldquo;sanctions relief&rdquo;, Don Jr&rsquo;s call to Lorber may be seen as something suggested by those present to get the ball rolling in terms of Russian money to the campaign. We will have another post shortly on the Mueller Mystery Case and what it means to Don Jr.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s finish by noting that Donald Trump threw his own son under the bus on Twitter. Howard Lorber is first and foremost Trump Sr&rsquo;s friend, but his dad described Lorber only in terms of knowing Junior. Patribotics own earlier reporting was not that anybody called Donald Trump, but that <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2017/07/15/exclusive-donald-trump-called-into-a-trump-tower-russian-spy-meeting/\">Donald Trump directly called </a><em><a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2017/07/15/exclusive-donald-trump-called-into-a-trump-tower-russian-spy-meeting/\">into </a></em><a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2017/07/15/exclusive-donald-trump-called-into-a-trump-tower-russian-spy-meeting/\">a Trump Tower meeting with Russians</a> &ndash; whether it was this meeting or another, sources did not specify.</p>\n<p><em>If you enjoy Patribotics, please <strong>consider a <a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\">donation here </a>. </strong>We need your help to keep going!</em></p>\n<ul><li><figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.reddit.com/static/button/button1.html?newwindow=true&width=120&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpatribotics.blog%2F2019%2F02%2F01%2Fhoward-lorber-don-jr-and-the-steele-dossier%2F&title=Howard%20Lorber%2C%20Don%20Jr%20and%20the%20Steele%20Dossier\"></iframe></figure></li></ul>",

                "text": "According to ABC News, the \u2018blocked numbers\u2019 Donald J Trump Jr called about his meeting with the Russian FSB asset Natalia Veselnitskaya include Howard Lorber. Donald Trump is gloating about this on Twitter this morning:\nThe trouble Messers. Trump and Trump Jr have about this revelation is that Howard Lorber fits extremely neatly into what we know about Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s collusion with the Russian state. A name not much floated in the mainstream press after 2016, but familiar to followers of the citizen journalism research group #TeamPatriot on Twitter, Lorber was a major contributor to the \u2018Trump Victory\u2019 Fund, and, more significantly, he was linked to Trump Moscow, and to Michael and Bryan Cohen.\nThe best mainstream reporting we have on Lorber is Josh Rogin\u2019s piece of August 2016 for the Washington Post. Rogin made it clear that that Lorber was tied to Russia in general and Trump Tower Moscow in particular. Rogin\u2019s piece also dwells on the fact that Lorber brought Trump to Russia as far back as 1996, and was an initial mover of the Trump Moscow project.\nBusinessman and investor Howard Lorber already donated $100,000 to the Trump Victory fund, has been named as one of Trump\u2019s \u201cbest friends\u201d and even appeared once on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d He is also president and chief executive of the Vector Group, a holding company that has various business interests in Russia. In 1996, Lorber brought Trump to Moscow to look for opportunities for Trump to lend his famous name to development projects there\u2026.\nAt that time, Trump and Lorber were discussing Trump building a huge luxury residential tower in Moscow as part of a project owned by a subsidiary of Lorber\u2019s firm.\nMichael Cohen\u2019s guilty plea of lying to Congress about Trump Tower Moscow, and Rudy Giuliani\u2019s disastrous admission that negotiations on the project had gone on \u2018until November\u2019 of 2016, make the Lorber name, in connection with Don Jr, extraordinarily significant.\nThe facts suggest that whatever Donald Trump Jr said to Mr. Lorber when he called him on this occasion, that the Russian meeting about offering dirt on Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign \u2013 part of the Russian government\u2019s support for Trump, as Don Jr was told \u2013 the call was placed to Lorber by Don Jr because Lorber was going to help launder Russian financial help into the Trump campaign.\nPatribotics is grateful for the readers who make our reporting possible. Your support helps us break stories and analyze all the key events on Trump and Russia. Please consider a donation here\nWhen I broke the story that the FBI were investigating the Trump campaign on Nov 7th, 2016, I reported that the FISA was targeted on \u2018two Russian banks\u2019 but covered \u2018any US person\u2019 in relation to these specific activities. For that, one may read \u2018packet data\u2019, as what was being sent between the Trump Tower server and Alfa Bank involved US persons to do with the campaign. The warrants in some way also sought permission for the FBI to listen to \u201cintelligence provided by friendly foreign agencies\u201d on US persons, I reported.\nBoth the Guardian and the BBC subsequently said that my accounts of the FISA warrant, and the turning down of James Comey\u2019s attempts in the summer to obtain a FISA warrant on Carter Page, Boris Epshteyn, and Paul Manafort, were correct. (The Guardian took two separate stories to do so; first they acknowledged that my account of the failed summer FISA applications on Trump campaign personnel was correct, and later, that my account of the granted FISA targeted on the two Russian banks was correct.)\nThe BBC\u2019s Paul Wood reported in January 2017. His piece was much wider than my own. Here are some of the relevant passages:\nAt the same time a joint taskforce, which includes the CIA and the FBI, has been investigating allegations that the Russians may have sent money to Mr Trump\u2019s organisation or his election campaign\u2026. a joint intelligence and law enforcement taskforce has been looking at allegations that the Kremlin paid money to his campaign through his associates.\nHoward Lorber donated to Trump Victory; Howard Lorber was instrumental in Trump Tower Moscow.\n(This joint Taskforce was separately reported by McClatchyDC.)\nWood\u2019s seminal piece continues:\nThe former MI6 agent\u2019s report detailed alleged attempts by the Kremlin to offer Mr Trump lucrative \u201csweetheart deals\u201d in Russia that would buy his loyalty.\nAgain, this sounds much like Trump Tower Moscow, started by Howard Lorber, about which Michael Cohen pled guilty about lying to Congress?\nLast April, the CIA director was shown intelligence that worried him. It was \u2013 allegedly \u2013 a tape recording of a conversation about money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign.\nAs I have reported, this intelligence was supplied by Estonia\u2019s world-class intelligence agency, Teabeamet. When the history of Trump Russia is eventually written, Teabeamet\u2019s role will loom large.\nMichael Cohen lied about Trump Tower Moscow, Howard Lorber started Trump Tower Moscow \u2013 surely real estate will be seen as a major vehicle by which Russia both laundered money to Trump and had its money laundered by Trump. Michael Cohen, according to the Wall Street Journal, purchased an apartment he had no real means to buy while the developers \u2013 including Lorber \u2013 held the note:\nMichael Cohen, Donald Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer who is under federal investigation, bought a $6.7 million apartment in April in a new Manhattan skyscraper that is being developed by two of Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime friends, according to people familiar with the transaction.\nLocated at 111 Murray Street in Manhattan\u2019s Tribeca neighborhood, the project is being developed by a partnership of real estate companies Fisher Brothers, Witkoff and New Valley. New Valley is headed by Howard Lorber, a real estate developer and longtime friend of Mr. Trump.\nMr. Cohen financed the purchase by securing a $3.5 million short-term mortgage from the developers, rather than getting financing from a bank, according to public records. While developers occasionally offer to finance purchases in their projects, such developer financing is unusual in Manhattan, real-estate attorneys say.\nHoward Lorber defended Trump paying no taxes in 2016. He was also singled out by Trump in his victory speech in his New York primary in April 2016 \u2013 exactly the time that Estonian intelligence were passing the \u2018money laundering\u2019 tape to the director of the CIA.\nBut there is more. Howard Lorber, according to reporting, is also involved with Douglas Elliman. (Yes, I know, I enjoy their listings too). Lorber\u2019s company Vector Group is the parent company of the famous real estate broker. Cohen\u2019s younger brother, Bryan, was reported to have received $7m in payments after he started working for Elliman, and thereby Howard Lorber, from a Ukranian \u201cagribusiness. \u201c\nIt was Bryan Cohen\u2019s father in law, Alex Oronov, who died after arranging Michael Cohen\u2019s meeting with Ukranian pro-Putin politician Andrey Artemenko and Felix Sater. Oronov was shown to have an apartment in Trump Hollywood. Buzzfeed News\u2019s Jason Leopold and Anthony Cormier rubbished the reporting of Oronov\u2019s death as suspicious:\nSome commentators have drawn a link between Oronov and the president by noting that Oronov owns property in Trump Hollywood, a condo tower in South Florida. But the Trump Organization has no connection to sales in that development, which merely leases the Trump name.\nSadly the Trump Organization did not get the Leopold-Cormier memo, as it quite literally lists Trump Hollywood as among its \u2018Real Estate Portfolio\u2019, devoting an entire page to it on the organisation\u2019s website.\nIf the Trump Tower meeting was \u2018a bust\u2019, as NSA veteran John Schindler has argued \u2013 the Russian side expected a commitment on sanctions, Don Jr and Paul Manafort expected immediate dirt on Hillary Clinton \u2013 it makes no difference to the Trump-Russia prosecutorial path. The attempt to collude and intent to collude is what counts. A call placed by Don Jr to Howard Lorber on a blocked number fits the idea that Russia was offering incentives, including money laundering via Trump Tower Moscow. It fits the description in the GRU\u2019s indictment by Mueller of multiple failed attempts to deliver the DNC emails to Wikileaks starting in June 2016:\nAfter failed attempts to transfer the stolen documents starting in late June 2016, on or about July 14, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, sent Organization 1 an email with an attachment titled \u201cwk dnc link1.txt.gpg.\u201d\nThe Lorber-Cohen-Trump Moscow connection is extremely strong, and it ties Donald Trump Jr directly to the events described in the Steele Dossier.\nIt was reported that Spanish intelligence had intercepted Alexander Torshin\u2019s calls to the money launderer Alexander Romanov and \u2018Mr Trump\u2019s son\u2019 \u201cshould be concerned\u201d. While most reporting concentrated on the NRA donor and Russian agent Maria Butina\u2019s mentor Mr. Torshin, it is worth noting what Romanov was convicted of. His money laundering was done through property purchases \u2013 exactly what Mr. Lorber specializes in.\nIf nothing of substance happened at the opening meeting, but Donald J Trump Jr believed he was going to get \u201cdirt on Clinton\u201d and Russia believed they were going to get \u201csanctions relief\u201d, Don Jr\u2019s call to Lorber may be seen as something suggested by those present to get the ball rolling in terms of Russian money to the campaign. We will have another post shortly on the Mueller Mystery Case and what it means to Don Jr.\nLet\u2019s finish by noting that Donald Trump threw his own son under the bus on Twitter. Howard Lorber is first and foremost Trump Sr\u2019s friend, but his dad described Lorber only in terms of knowing Junior. Patribotics own earlier reporting was not that anybody called Donald Trump, but that Donald Trump directly called into a Trump Tower meeting with Russians \u2013 whether it was this meeting or another, sources did not specify.\nIf you enjoy Patribotics, please consider a donation here .

His team does not leak. The subject bank might leak, of course, but we are unlikely to find out, before the case is unsealed, who the mystery reluctant witness is. The leading possibilities, however, are all disastrous for Donald Trump and Jared Kushner. I am not a betting woman, but if I were, I should put a few roubles on Vnesheconombank or VEB, for reasons I explain below.</p>\n<h4><em>Patribotics is grateful for the support of our readers, which makes our journalism possible. If you can help us, please</em><strong><a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\"><em>donate.</em></a></strong></h4>\n<h4>The Qatar Investment Authority </h4>\n<p>The analyst <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emptywheel/status/1075958182038700033\">Marci Wheeler </a>has been arguing that the mystery entity is the Qatar Investment Authority, whom Jared Kushner, I have suggested, was attempting to extort for money for his building at 666 Park Avenue. This is a popular theory and may well be true. Chris Geider <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/1082769772926910465\">reported</a> that the Corporation was served the subpoena at its US offices.</p>\n<p>Wheeler <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emptywheel/status/1082781629809070082\">pointed out</a> that the QIA&rsquo;s New York offices are &lsquo;a two minute walk from Trump Towers&rsquo;. She <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emptywheel/status/1088125151785365504\">notes</a> that Qatar previously refused to give evidence on Jared Kushner to Mueller, for fear of Trump&rsquo;s retaliation. NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/qataris-opted-not-give-info-kushner-secret-meetings-mueller-n855326\">reported</a> last year:</p>\n<p><em>WASHINGTON &mdash; Qatari officials gathered evidence of what they claim is illicit influence by the United Arab Emirates on </em><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/kushner-security-clearance-downgraded-n851746\"><em>Jared Kushner</em></a><em> and other Trump associates, including details of secret meetings, but decided not to give the information to special counsel </em><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jared-kushner-now-under-fbi-scrutiny-russia-probe-say-officials-n764826\"><em>Robert Mueller</em></a><em> for fear of harming relations with the Trump administration, say three sources familiar with the Qatari discussions.</em></p>\n<p>However, the story goes on:</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;On the topic of the Special Counsel&rsquo;s investigation: Qatar has not been approached nor has it considered approaching the Special Counsel&rsquo;s Office or any entity within the United States Government,&rdquo; said [Qatar&rsquo;s Ambassador to the US] Al Thani.</em></p>\n<p>However, the evidence described is not banking evidence primarily, and is not attributed to a bank but to diplomats &lsquo;familiar with Qatari internal discussions&rsquo;. As written, I suggest that this story is closer to my own theory that there is audio of Mr. Kushner or his representatives attempting to extort Qatar to invest in 666 Park Avenue, before changing US foreign policy against them when they refused.</p>\n<p>The most important argument against the Qatar theory, I would argue, is that it is Robert Mueller who is bringing the case. Mueller is not bringing peripheral cases. His mandate is to investigate collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia during the election. Where he discovers other crimes arising, he can prosecute, but he has chosen not to do so. Michael Cohen&rsquo;s nonsense with Stormy Daniels and Trump was passed off to SDNY. Maria Butina&rsquo;s case was <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-charged-conspiracy-act-agent-russian-federation-within-united-states\">not a Bob Mueller case</a>, not directly: as the DoJ website puts it:</p>\n<p><em>The investigation into this matter was conducted by the FBI&rsquo;s Washington Field Office. The case is being prosecuted by the National Security Section of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Columbia and the National Security Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.</em></p>\n<p>Therefore, the RDIF&rsquo;s involvement with Kirill Dimitriev in the Seychelles, and Qatar&rsquo;s refusal &ndash; at least initially &ndash; to comply with Jared Kushner&rsquo;s attempts at extortion &ndash; although deeply corrupt, and involving many of the personae who attacked our election, most of what we know about those institutions in public reporting occurred <em>after </em>the election was over. It is more likely that Mr. Mueller would hand such investigations to other divisions of the DOJ for prosecution.</p>\n<h4>The Russian Direct Investment Fund or the Central Bank of Russia</h4>\n<p>These are both state owned enterprises; they both might claim sovereign immunity; they both carry out business in the United States, and they are both connected to Mueller&rsquo;s inquiry. Alexander Torshin, the mentor of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/13/politics/maria-butina-guilty-plea/index.html\">unregistered Russian agent</a> Maria Butina, who admitted conspiring against the United States, is a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-16/russian-gun-rights-advocate-arrested-by-u-s-for-conspiracy\">Deputy Governor of Russia&rsquo;s Central Bank</a>. It doesn&rsquo;t get more &ldquo;sovereign wealth&rdquo; than that. I have reported that Russian money was washed into the GOP during the campaign with the connivance of the NRA, and that the FBI have recordings of this being discussed with multiple GOP bigwigs, including the former Speaker Paul Ryan and then Chairman of the GOP Reince Priebus. Certainly, with Butina in custody, the FBI would be interested in her efforts on Russia&rsquo;s behalf with Torshin. Mitigating against this, though, is the point that Butina&rsquo;s case is with the National Security Division, not Mueller.</p>\n<p>The RDIF, or Sovereign Wealth Fund, suggested by some analysts, is also an attractive possibility. It could make an argument based on sovereignty, and it intersects with Mueller very firmly as we see Erik Prince being tasked by Mike Flynn and Jared Kushner; George Nader, the pedophile aide to the Crown Prince of the UAE and &lsquo;Mr. Fixit&rsquo; who set up this meeting had done some data work for Trump during the election. However, again, the largest headlines for this matter are about things that occurred <em>after </em>the election of Trump, and Mueller&rsquo;s own prosecutions seem to be very tightly focused on his specific case; Russians attacking the US election and Americans lying to law enforcement or Congress about colluding with those Russians. Furthermore I have not been able easily to find offices in America for the Central Bank of Russia or the RDIF, although they may exist.</p>\n<p>The Marcy Wheeler theory of Qatar would mean, if sustained, that Mueller was looking to them for evidence of a crime committed by Kushner &ndash; which Trump would be complicit in, changing US foreign policy for a bribe. The RDIF or Central Bank of Russia again, at the simplest level &ndash; considering this is a Mueller case &ndash; would mean Mueller was looking for data from financial arms of the Russian state implying criminal acts during the transition, and possibly relating to George Nader&rsquo;s data efforts. The last candidate, my own best guess, would be by far the worst news for Donald Trump. It was a bank whose boss was brought to Trump Tower at the request of the Russian Ambassador; it is a bank whose supervisory chairman is the a<em>ctual Russian Prime Minister</em>. If Mueller believes that VEB, Vnesheconombank, is holding evidence that links the Trump campaign to collusion with the Russian state, then the consequences for Donald Trump and those around him in the campaign are incalculably bad.</p>\n<h4>My Theory &ndash; Vnesheconombank</h4>\n<p>Vnesheconombank also fits the facts as we know it: the entity is a fully state-owned bank, it <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/30/politics/mueller-mystery-case-firm-confirmed/index.html\">employs </a>a legal team who have worked in Russian interests before, it will have &lsquo;commercial interests&rsquo;, it is wholly owned by the state (this detail ruled out Sberbank and Alfa Bank) and &lsquo;Country A&rsquo; has argued that it would be required to <a href=\"https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/2-502-2227?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true&comp=pluk&bhcp=1\">violate its own laws </a>by complying with Mueller&rsquo;s subpoena. This could refer to Russian data protection laws making it illegal for Russian banks to transfer data on Russian citizens without their consent outside of Russia, fitting better than the RDIF or the Central Bank.</p>\n<p>Vnesheconombank also has offices in New York City, at 777 Third Avenue.</p>\n<p>Vnesheconombank has perhaps the single greatest claim to &ldquo;sovereign immunity&rdquo; outside of the Central Bank of Russia. As the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/business/vnesheconombank-veb-bank-russia-trump-kushner.html\">reported</a> in early 2017:</p>\n<p><em>Vnesheconombank, or VEB, is no normal bank. It is wholly owned by the Russian state. It is intertwined with Russian intelligence. And the Russian prime minister is, by law, the chairman of its supervisory board.</em></p>\n<p>Famously, Sergey N. Gorkov, its chief, a former Russian spy, met with Jared Kushner during the transition. Now, one might argue that this is also part and parcel of post-election corruption, but the visit had several elements that tie it in to pre-election collusion as well; it was publicly tied to the lifting of sanctions, a key element, I have reported, and Chris Steele first reported, of the Trump-Russia &ldquo;hacking help for sanctions lifting&rdquo; deal.</p>\n<p><em>VEB has quietly kept up appearances on Wall Street in the event that sanctions would be lifted, according to interviews with American bankers and former government officials&hellip;.Mr. Gorkov met with bankers at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and another, unidentified American financial institution. Goldman Sachs bankers also tried to arrange a meeting but ultimately had a scheduling conflict. The meetings, which are not prohibited by sanctions, were confirmed by three people briefed on the discussions but unauthorized to speak publicly about them</em></p>\n<p>Now, such activity would certainly fall squarely within the government&rsquo;s case filings that speak of, as a <a href=\"http://www.jha.com/us/blog/?blogID=4543\">concurring opinion</a> in the case put it, <em>&lsquo;the government&rsquo;s theory turned only on the &ldquo;considerable business&rdquo; of a U.S. office of the Corporation&rsquo;</em>. Furthermore, the Gorkov-Kushner visit gave two different explanations for the reason that Kushner and Gorkov met with each other. The Trump White House, according to the New York Times, said &ldquo;<em>[Ambassador] Kislyak requested the meeting and that &ldquo;Mr. Kushner was acting in his capacity as a transition official.</em>&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>\n<p>Such an explanation, along with Kushner&rsquo;s attempt to establish a new &ldquo;backchannel&rdquo; to Russia, would fall firmly within Mueller&rsquo;s criminal investigation. Sergei Kislyak met Republicans, including Trump, Priebus and Ryan, at the RNC, and discussed with them how to wash Russian money to the campaign. Kislyak also met Jeff Sessions, who then lied about it, causing him to be forced to recuse from this investigation. And Kislyak, Trump, Manafort and Epshteyn, I reported, were taped at the Mayflower hotel using Sergei Kislyak&rsquo;s hot-miked phone, discussing Carter Page taking an offer to Moscow; sanctions relief in exchange for hacking help.</p>\n<p>Mr. Manafort, according to the Steele Dossier, was using Carter Page as his &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo; to Russia. Manafort was present at the Donald Trump Jr. meeting in Trump Tower.</p>\n<p>Kushner&rsquo;s own explanation was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/explanations-for-kushners-meeting-with-head-of-kremlin-linked-bank-dont-match-up/2017/06/01/dd1bdbb0-460a-11e7-bcde-624ad94170ab_story.html?utm_term=.9266646c66db\">contradicted by VEB</a>.</p>\n<p><em>But VEB said Mr. Gorkov had met with Mr. Kushner, who was still running his family&rsquo;s real estate company, to discuss business. </em></p>\n<p>That would be because VEB, as representing the Russian state, could not do foreign policy business with Kushner while Obama was still President. It could also be that Gorkov offered Kushner a bribe, not directly through VEB, but via VTB or other companies with which they did business. It is more likely that Mueller would be interested in collusion with the Russian state during the election than corruption after it; nonetheless the fact that Kushner and VEB conflicted in their statements will surely be of interest to Mueller.</p>\n<p>For all these reasons, and others which relate to the FISA warrants on two Russian banks which I first reported in October 2017 &ndash; reasons that I shall detail in my next piece &ndash; I believe that it is most likely that Vnesheconombank is the subject of the Mueller subpoena.

                "text": "Which is the institution at the heart of Bob Mueller\u2019s \u2018mystery case\u2019 and why does it matter so much?\nBob Mueller does not leak. His team does not leak. The subject bank might leak, of course, but we are unlikely to find out, before the case is unsealed, who the mystery reluctant witness is. The leading possibilities, however, are all disastrous for Donald Trump and Jared Kushner. I am not a betting woman, but if I were, I should put a few roubles on Vnesheconombank or VEB, for reasons I explain below.\nPatribotics is grateful for the support of our readers, which makes our journalism possible. If you can help us, please donate.\nThe Qatar Investment Authority\nThe analyst Marci Wheeler has been arguing that the mystery entity is the Qatar Investment Authority, whom Jared Kushner, I have suggested, was attempting to extort for money for his building at 666 Park Avenue. This is a popular theory and may well be true. Chris Geider reported that the Corporation was served the subpoena at its US offices.\nWheeler pointed out that the QIA\u2019s New York offices are \u2018a two minute walk from Trump Towers\u2019. She notes that Qatar previously refused to give evidence on Jared Kushner to Mueller, for fear of Trump\u2019s retaliation. NBC News reported last year:\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Qatari officials gathered evidence of what they claim is illicit influence by the United Arab Emirates on Jared Kushner and other Trump associates, including details of secret meetings, but decided not to give the information to special counsel Robert Mueller for fear of harming relations with the Trump administration, say three sources familiar with the Qatari discussions.\nHowever, the story goes on:\n\u201cOn the topic of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation: Qatar has not been approached nor has it considered approaching the Special Counsel\u2019s Office or any entity within the United States Government,\u201d said [Qatar\u2019s Ambassador to the US] Al Thani.\nHowever, the evidence described is not banking evidence primarily, and is not attributed to a bank but to diplomats \u2018familiar with Qatari internal discussions\u2019. As written, I suggest that this story is closer to my own theory that there is audio of Mr. Kushner or his representatives attempting to extort Qatar to invest in 666 Park Avenue, before changing US foreign policy against them when they refused.\nThe most important argument against the Qatar theory, I would argue, is that it is Robert Mueller who is bringing the case. Mueller is not bringing peripheral cases. His mandate is to investigate collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia during the election. Where he discovers other crimes arising, he can prosecute, but he has chosen not to do so. Michael Cohen\u2019s nonsense with Stormy Daniels and Trump was passed off to SDNY. Maria Butina\u2019s case was not a Bob Mueller case, not directly: as the DoJ website puts it:\nThe investigation into this matter was conducted by the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office. The case is being prosecuted by the National Security Section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia and the National Security Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.\nTherefore, the RDIF\u2019s involvement with Kirill Dimitriev in the Seychelles, and Qatar\u2019s refusal \u2013 at least initially \u2013 to comply with Jared Kushner\u2019s attempts at extortion \u2013 although deeply corrupt, and involving many of the personae who attacked our election, most of what we know about those institutions in public reporting occurred after the election was over. It is more likely that Mr. Mueller would hand such investigations to other divisions of the DOJ for prosecution.\nThe Russian Direct Investment Fund or the Central Bank of Russia\nThese are both state owned enterprises; they both might claim sovereign immunity; they both carry out business in the United States, and they are both connected to Mueller\u2019s inquiry. Alexander Torshin, the mentor of unregistered Russian agent Maria Butina, who admitted conspiring against the United States, is a Deputy Governor of Russia\u2019s Central Bank. It doesn\u2019t get more \u201csovereign wealth\u201d than that. I have reported that Russian money was washed into the GOP during the campaign with the connivance of the NRA, and that the FBI have recordings of this being discussed with multiple GOP bigwigs, including the former Speaker Paul Ryan and then Chairman of the GOP Reince Priebus. Certainly, with Butina in custody, the FBI would be interested in her efforts on Russia\u2019s behalf with Torshin. Mitigating against this, though, is the point that Butina\u2019s case is with the National Security Division, not Mueller.\nThe RDIF, or Sovereign Wealth Fund, suggested by some analysts, is also an attractive possibility. It could make an argument based on sovereignty, and it intersects with Mueller very firmly as we see Erik Prince being tasked by Mike Flynn and Jared Kushner; George Nader, the pedophile aide to the Crown Prince of the UAE and \u2018Mr. Fixit\u2019 who set up this meeting had done some data work for Trump during the election. However, again, the largest headlines for this matter are about things that occurred after the election of Trump, and Mueller\u2019s own prosecutions seem to be very tightly focused on his specific case; Russians attacking the US election and Americans lying to law enforcement or Congress about colluding with those Russians. Furthermore I have not been able easily to find offices in America for the Central Bank of Russia or the RDIF, although they may exist.\nThe Marcy Wheeler theory of Qatar would mean, if sustained, that Mueller was looking to them for evidence of a crime committed by Kushner \u2013 which Trump would be complicit in, changing US foreign policy for a bribe. The RDIF or Central Bank of Russia again, at the simplest level \u2013 considering this is a Mueller case \u2013 would mean Mueller was looking for data from financial arms of the Russian state implying criminal acts during the transition, and possibly relating to George Nader\u2019s data efforts. The last candidate, my own best guess, would be by far the worst news for Donald Trump. It was a bank whose boss was brought to Trump Tower at the request of the Russian Ambassador; it is a bank whose supervisory chairman is the actual Russian Prime Minister. If Mueller believes that VEB, Vnesheconombank, is holding evidence that links the Trump campaign to collusion with the Russian state, then the consequences for Donald Trump and those around him in the campaign are incalculably bad.\nMy Theory \u2013 Vnesheconombank\nVnesheconombank also fits the facts as we know it: the entity is a fully state-owned bank, it employs a legal team who have worked in Russian interests before, it will have \u2018commercial interests\u2019, it is wholly owned by the state (this detail ruled out Sberbank and Alfa Bank) and \u2018Country A\u2019 has argued that it would be required to violate its own laws by complying with Mueller\u2019s subpoena. This could refer to Russian data protection laws making it illegal for Russian banks to transfer data on Russian citizens without their consent outside of Russia, fitting better than the RDIF or the Central Bank.\nVnesheconombank also has offices in New York City, at 777 Third Avenue.\nVnesheconombank has perhaps the single greatest claim to \u201csovereign immunity\u201d outside of the Central Bank of Russia. As the New York Times reported in early 2017:\nVnesheconombank, or VEB, is no normal bank. It is wholly owned by the Russian state. It is intertwined with Russian intelligence. And the Russian prime minister is, by law, the chairman of its supervisory board.\nFamously, Sergey N. Gorkov, its chief, a former Russian spy, met with Jared Kushner during the transition. Now, one might argue that this is also part and parcel of post-election corruption, but the visit had several elements that tie it in to pre-election collusion as well; it was publicly tied to the lifting of sanctions, a key element, I have reported, and Chris Steele first reported, of the Trump-Russia \u201chacking help for sanctions lifting\u201d deal.\nVEB has quietly kept up appearances on Wall Street in the event that sanctions would be lifted, according to interviews with American bankers and former government officials\u2026.Mr. Gorkov met with bankers at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and another, unidentified American financial institution. Goldman Sachs bankers also tried to arrange a meeting but ultimately had a scheduling conflict. The meetings, which are not prohibited by sanctions, were confirmed by three people briefed on the discussions but unauthorized to speak publicly about them\nNow, such activity would certainly fall squarely within the government\u2019s case filings that speak of, as a concurring opinion in the case put it, \u2018the government\u2019s theory turned only on the \u201cconsiderable business\u201d of a U.S. office of the Corporation\u2019. Furthermore, the Gorkov-Kushner visit gave two different explanations for the reason that Kushner and Gorkov met with each other. The Trump White House, according to the New York Times, said \u201c[Ambassador] Kislyak requested the meeting and that \u201cMr. Kushner was acting in his capacity as a transition official.\u201d\u2019\nSuch an explanation, along with Kushner\u2019s attempt to establish a new \u201cbackchannel\u201d to Russia, would fall firmly within Mueller\u2019s criminal investigation. Sergei Kislyak met Republicans, including Trump, Priebus and Ryan, at the RNC, and discussed with them how to wash Russian money to the campaign. Kislyak also met Jeff Sessions, who then lied about it, causing him to be forced to recuse from this investigation. And Kislyak, Trump, Manafort and Epshteyn, I reported, were taped at the Mayflower hotel using Sergei Kislyak\u2019s hot-miked phone, discussing Carter Page taking an offer to Moscow; sanctions relief in exchange for hacking help.\nMr. Manafort, according to the Steele Dossier, was using Carter Page as his \u201cintermediary\u201d to Russia. Manafort was present at the Donald Trump Jr. meeting in Trump Tower.\nKushner\u2019s own explanation was contradicted by VEB.\nBut VEB said Mr. Gorkov had met with Mr. Kushner, who was still running his family\u2019s real estate company, to discuss business.\nThat would be because VEB, as representing the Russian state, could not do foreign policy business with Kushner while Obama was still President. It could also be that Gorkov offered Kushner a bribe, not directly through VEB, but via VTB or other companies with which they did business. It is more likely that Mueller would be interested in collusion with the Russian state during the election than corruption after it; nonetheless the fact that Kushner and VEB conflicted in their statements will surely be of interest to Mueller.\nFor all these reasons, and others which relate to the FISA warrants on two Russian banks which I first reported in October 2017 \u2013 reasons that I shall detail in my next piece \u2013 I believe that it is most likely that Vnesheconombank is the subject of the Mueller subpoena.

Parts of them had been<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/us/politics/trump-tower-putin-felix-sater.html\"> published before </a>in the New York Times, but the completeness of this dump was certainly new. The online publication also provided a useful timeline at the side of its story.</p>\n<p>It seems relatively clear that Felix Sater himself was a source, if not the source, on this story. An enormous number of emails were addressed to or from him, something that the publication does not seek to hide, choosing to redact only actual email addresses and phone numbers in many cases. The story did not get as much traction online as you might expect, a consequence perhaps both of the Office of the Special Counsel correcting its authors earlier assertion that it was in possession of apparently non-existent documents showing that Donald Trump ordered Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. One of the authors, Anthony Cormier, denied having personally seen these documents, whereas his co-author Jason Leopold said that they had both seen them. Cormier declined to explain when the discrepancy was put to him on &lsquo;Reliable Sources&rsquo; and the anchor, Brian Stelter, did not follow up or press him on the point. This inconsistent explanation for the reporting, which was followed by mass firings at Buzzfeed, may have dampened reactions to what should have been another ostensibly huge story.</p>\n<p>The social media hive mind pounced on the undisclosed elements of the releases, which involve VTB and, I suggest, implicate VEB &lsquo;off stage&rsquo;. But the lack of amazement, of celebration of Sater as a &lsquo;whistleblower&rsquo;, will not have pleased him. Surely Mr. Sater felt the need to get these documents out there &ndash; and to a friendly news site.</p>\n<h4>Felix Sater&rsquo;s Relationship With Buzzfeed</h4>\n<p>Unlike the controversial article which was corrected by Bob Mueller, where only Leopold claimed the authors saw the alleged documents at its heart, a story which can be mostly ascribed, therefore, to Leopold, Felix Sater is principally Anthony Cormier&rsquo;s friend and source. The pair&rsquo;s story &ldquo;Trump Moscow: The Definitive Story of How Trump&rsquo;s Team Worked The Russian Deal During The Campaign&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/trump-moscow-micheal-cohen-felix-sater-campaign\">has a URL</a> that shows it was filed by Cormier. Cormier is bylined on a frankly ridiculous story that seeks to defend Felix Sater as, get this, an &lsquo;American spy.&rsquo;</p>\n<p><strong>I<em>n the sprawling</em></strong><em> Trump-Russia investigation, one name constantly pops up: Felix Sater. In story after story, Sater is described as Donald Trump&rsquo;s former business partner, a convicted stock swindler who was born in the Soviet Union, worked in Russia, tried to win Trump a deal in Moscow, and even helped broker a Ukrainian peace plan that Vladimir Putin would have loved.</em></p>\n<p><em>Basically, he&rsquo;s portrayed as something just short of a Russian spy.</em></p>\n<p><em>Effectively, he has been a spy &mdash; but for the United States. </em></p>\n<p>This is an hilariously bad piece of &lsquo;trust washing&rsquo; that attempts to convince the public that the man who was conspiring with Putin to elect Trump, <em>in his own words, </em> is somehow one of the good guys. Sater was an FBI asset, a &lsquo;dangle&rsquo; , never a spy. He bombastically, and falsely, stated that he caught Osama Bin Laden. But Cormier&rsquo;s was not the only piece of &lsquo;trust washing&rsquo; on Sater. A concerted PR effort can be seen, without too much trouble, when one reviews other pieces trying to <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/2018/06/15/sater-963255.html\">sanitize this two-bit mobster</a>; they all follow the same lines: &lsquo;Hey, did you know that Felix Sater was <em>an informant for the FBI</em>?&rdquo; The conspiracy theorists Who What Why, a website run by Russ Baker, a man that <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_profile/the_world_according_to_russ_baker.php\">said the Bushes did 9/11</a>, have been desperately trying to spin for Sater, and at the same time, make the case that the fact he once informed for the FBI not only gives Sater a pass, but actually stops Mueller from prosecuting Trump. Just after Comey was fired in May of 2017, Baker published <a href=\"https://whowhatwhy.org/2017/03/27/fbi-cant-tell-trump-russia/\">a story </a>entitled &ldquo;WHY FBI CAN&rsquo;T TELL ALL ON TRUMP, RUSSIA&rdquo;, which tried to make the case that</p>\n<blockquote><p> the FBI&rsquo;s Russia investigation was compromised because it could interfere with the Bureau&rsquo;s objective of fighting organized crime originating in the former Soviet Union</p>Sure, Jan<br><br></blockquote>\n<p>and all because of Felix Sater, whom Who What Why then tried to <a href=\"https://whowhatwhy.org/2017/08/29/everything-felix-sater/\">whitewash</a> in many more articles, always making the case that because the FBI trusted him once, he was somehow now inviolate. Sater pitched the line that he was a sacred, untouchable FBI informant to other outlets &ndash; who were, thankfully, more skeptical than Buzzfeed or Who What Why. The LA Times <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:BOVX_F84iioJ:https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-sater-trump-20170223-story.html+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=safari\">said</a> for example that:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Sater&rsquo;s lawyer, Robert W. Wolf, gives his client more credit, saying he worked with &ldquo;numerous U.S. national security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies.&rdquo; Sater says he helped hunt &ldquo;America&rsquo;s greatest enemies&rdquo; in Afghanistan and elsewhere.</em></p><p><em>There is no independent verification of those assertions.</em></p><p><em>Former CIA officials who worked in counter-terrorism and Russian affairs said they never heard of Sater and doubt his cloak-and-dagger claims of chasing down terrorists.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Sater laid relatively quiet after his triumphant Buzzfeed hagiography. Anthony Cormier, its author, had, without declaring it in the article, taken Mr. Sater out socializing to drinks and dinner parties in Manhattan before it was published. For Felix Sater, this partying appeared to be <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-04/felix-sater-long-time-business-partner-to-donald-trump/9815904\">part of a strategy</a> to use the media as his defense.</p>\n<p>Sater did seem absolutely determined to ensure he was falsely portrayed as a cooperating witness, as a friend to the media and liberal establishments. Sater tried to get himself photographed hanging out with as many of the &lsquo;resistor&rsquo; and media elite as possible.</p>\n<p>Online, Sater boasted of his links to journalism and was, inexplicably, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/felixsater/status/1045854453801246720\">invited</a> to speak at multiple journalism schools. His exchanges with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/felixsater/status/1015235291412606976\">this reporter</a> were less cordial. When I pointed out to some of the alt-left whom they were hanging out with, Mr. Sater <a href=\"https://twitter.com/felixsater/status/1011495288396271617\">sent me a link to</a> to the Buzzfeed piece authored by his social partner Mr. Cormier who had taken Sater to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/1011418043002613760\">dinner party</a>. we were discussing.</p>\n<ul

Yahoo Broke the Trump Tower Moscow Story</h4>\n<p>It seems not unreasonable then to assume that the vast dumps of emails on Trump Tower came not from &lsquo;investigative journalism&rsquo; but simply from Sater handing them over to be published by a friendly outlet. Cormier and Leopold received a great many plaudits for their story in May 2018, the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/trump-moscow-micheal-cohen-felix-sater-campaign\">definitive story</a>&rdquo; of Trump Tower Moscow. In retrospect, however, the story was indeed definitive and exhaustive merely because Sater had given them his emails. The story, however, was not at all broken by Leopold and Cormier. The news that Trump Tower Moscow had gone on longer than admitted by Donald Trump or Michael Cohen was <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/michael-cohens-efforts-build-trump-tower-moscow-went-longer-previously-acknowledged-232845349.html\">broken in an exclusive report by Yahoo News&rsquo; Hunter Walker and Brett Arnold </a>on May 16th.</p>\n<h5>Patribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers.

It is clear from the Walker-Arnold piece that Sater admitted to them the documents existed, but only after they learned of their existence from multiple sources in Congress. The authors say Sater &ldquo;confirmed&rdquo; to them what they had already learned through their reporting. It&rsquo;s also clear that they did not have possession of the emails.</p>\n<p><em>Multiple sources have described to Yahoo News the texts and emails with Cohen that Sater has provided to the government. Sater confirmed to Yahoo News that he provided all of his texts and emails with Cohen to special counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s team as well as to the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate&rsquo;s Intelligence and Judiciary committees.</em></p>\n<p><em>The emails and texts described to Yahoo News, which have not previously been made public</em></p>\n<p>After Yahoo&rsquo;s Walker and Arnold broke the news of these documents, Mr. Sater, who whatever his other shortcomings appears to have a flair for PR, worked with Cormier and Leopold so they could publish their much longer &ldquo;definitive&rdquo; Trump Tower Moscow piece. In retrospect, it is clear that this piece was based on Sater simply handing over his emails to the journalists. They quote extensively from them. Cormier and Leopold made a deeply ungenerous reference to Walker and Arnold&rsquo;s breaking of the news in their prologue:</p>\n<p><em>While fragments of the Trump Moscow venture have trickled out &mdash; most recently in a report last night by </em><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/michael-cohens-efforts-build-trump-tower-moscow-went-longer-previously-acknowledged-232845349.html\"><em>Yahoo News</em></a><em> &mdash; this is the definitive story of the Moscow tower</em></p>\n<p>The authors then attempt to pretend that their sources were &lsquo;two FBI agents&rsquo; while not admitting that their actual source was, quite simply, their friend Felix Sater, who&rsquo;d given them the documents whose existence Walker and Arnold had discovered through independent, investigative reporting. It is important at this moment to understand that even while Sater was partying with the left and positioning himself as a media player, he was, throughout, shilling for Donald Trump and denying collusion with Russia. His actions were designed to damage, not support, Mueller&rsquo;s investigation. At the Manhattan dinner party to which Anthony Cormier took him, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/1011405064714498048\">Sater posed with a bottle of wine labeled &ldquo;Collusion&rdquo;</a> (yes, really) that he <a href=\"http://archive.is/tuNji\">described</a> as being &ldquo;weak, like the investigation&rdquo;. When he jumped into my conversation with somebody else and I replied &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t talking to you, traitor,&rdquo; Mr. Sater sent me a meme of a therapist asking an insane patient &ldquo;Is the Russian collusion in the room with us&hellip; right now?&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"8276\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"collusion-sater\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/patribotics.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/collusion-sater.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/patribotics.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/collusion-sater.jpg?resize=316%2C420&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/patribotics.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/collusion-sater.jpg?fit=225%2C300&ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/patribotics.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/collusion-sater.jpg?fit=900%2C1200&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"900,1200\" data-permalink=\"https://patribotics.blog/collusion-sater/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/patribotics.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/collusion-sater.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img><figcaption>Sater poses with a bottle of wine called &lsquo;Collusion&rsquo;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When the independent journalist Wendy Siegelman noted Sater&rsquo;s intense PR blitz, Sater replied with a triumphant meme of Leonardo di Caprio &lsquo;So much more to come&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Why then is Mr. Sater now choosing to have all his emails published in such meticulous detail? The earlier &ldquo;definitive Trump Moscow&rdquo; story he sourced got most of the substance out. What could be the hurry now in terms of making sure every email sees the light of day?</p>\n<h4>Does Mueller&rsquo;s Mystery Case Involve Trump&rsquo;s RICO Indictment, and is Sater Running Scared?</h4>\n<p>In a previous article, I laid out the r<a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2019/02/02/muellers-mystery-case-trumps-worst-news-yet/\">unners and riders for the Mueller &lsquo;mystery witness&rsquo; case</a>, where my own bet is that the subject is VEB. Whether I am right or wrong, Mr. Sater may agree with me that the subject is a Russian bank. Here are some things we can say for certain:</p>\n<ol><li>The case is very important, receiving certiorari in the Supreme Court &ndash; although clearly that may mean that the point of law, rather than the actors involved, are important</li><li>The case impacts national security and is likely to involve important actors because, distinct from the &lsquo;importance via certiorari&rsquo; point, the courthouse authorities took extraordinary steps to conceal the identity of the appellant from reporters</li><li>The &lsquo;mystery case&rsquo; entity and associated amicus briefs are, by definition, not the <em>subject </em>of this specific Mueller case. Mr. Mueller is trying to <em>subpoena </em>a witness in his case. The sovereign financial entity is not accused of a crime in this case. Its data, that it is resisting handing over, is merely &lsquo;witness evidence&rsquo; to the crime committed by the completely unknown target of the case. </li></ol>\n<p>Patribotics has reported exclusively that Donald Trump is personally indicted, under seal, on RICO charges along with Felix Sater, the Trump Organization and Bayrock.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Patribotics is grateful for the support of our readers, which makes our journalism possible. If you can help us, please </strong></em><a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\"><em><strong>donate.</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Is it possible that VEB, the state-run entity, is being subpoenaed for records that relate to some of Felix Sater&rsquo;s funders on the Trump Organization-Bayrock deal? VEB might have records on transfers made to VTB, the commercial Russian bank involved in the Bayrock deal; or to Sergei Kislyak, whom, Felix Sater&rsquo;s chosen messenger Jason Leopold reported,</p>\n<p>The first Trump sealed indictment, I exclusively reported, had its genesis in a state <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2017/05/29/donald-trump-sealed-indictment-started-with-eric-schneiderman/\">Enterprise Corruption case from Eric Schneiderman,</a> when he was the Attorney General of New York, I also reported that Schneiderman had had <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2017/07/18/exclusive-eric-schneiderman-had-donald-trump-under-state-surveillance/\">Trump Tower under state surveillance for well over a year</a> &ndash; something that would not require a FISA warrant for AG Schneiderman to do. I reported, still further, that Paul Manafort, who promised &lsquo;cooperation&rsquo; with the FBI before allowing a &lsquo;by consent&rsquo; search of his apartment at Trump Tower, had lied to the FBI about what was there, cleaning out his apartment in advance and removing items to Florida.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-06-21/trump-russia-and-those-shadowy-sater-deals-at-bayrock\">reported with a clear-eyed view</a> on Sater, Bayrock and Trump:</p>\n<p><em>In that context, a troubling history of Trump&rsquo;s </em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-08-02/on-trump-s-bromance-with-putin-and-russia\"><em>dealings</em></a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-08-05/donald-trump-s-colorful-business-partners\"><em>with Russians</em></a><em> exists outside of Russia: in a dormant real-estate development firm, the Bayrock Group, which once </em><strong>operated just two floors beneath the president&rsquo;s own office in Trump Tower</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Bayrock partnered with the future president and his two eldest children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, on a series of real-estate deals between 2002 and about 2011</em><strong><em>,</em></strong><em> the most prominent being the troubled Trump Soho hotel and condominium in Manhattan.</em></p>\n<p><em>During the years that Bayrock and Trump did deals together, the company was also a bridge between murky European funding and a number of projects in the U.S. to which the president once lent his name in exchange for handsome fees. Icelandic banks that dealt with Bayrock, for example, were easy marks for money launderers and foreign influence, according to interviews with government investigators, legislators, and others in Reykjavik, Brussels, Paris and London. Trump testified under oath in a 2007 deposition that Bayrock brought Russian investors to his Trump Tower office to discuss deals in Moscow, and said he was pondering investing there.</em></p>\n<p><em>One of Bayrock&rsquo;s principals was a career criminal named Felix Sater who had ties to Russian and American organized crime groups. Before linking up with the company and with Trump, he had worked as a mob informant for the U.S. government, fled to Moscow to avoid criminal charges while boasting of his KGB and Kremlin contacts there, and had gone to prison for slashing apart another man&rsquo;s face with a broken cocktail glass.</em></p>\n<p><em>In a series of interviews and a lawsuit, a former Bayrock insider, Jody Kriss, claims that he eventually departed from the firm because he became convinced that Bayrock was actually a front for money laundering.</em></p>\n<p>Let us then cross-reference this with some other facts. Has Mr. Sater got wind that, no matter how many public relations pieces he places with Buzzfeed or Newsweek, US intelligence does not regard him as &ldquo;An American Spy&rdquo; and is about to unseal charges on him, personally, for RICO? My reporting is that the first sealed indictment on Donald Trump as a person is for RICO, that the Trump Organization is indicted as a corrupt organization, and that the specific case was that of Felix Sater and Bayrock. Sater&rsquo;s motivation might then have been to warn his masters in Russia of some of what Mueller has on them; or to lobby Trump for a pardon. This money laundering by Sater and Trump with the Trump Organization pre-dated the election campaign of 2016. But the pre-Mueller, <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2017/05/14/exclusive-sealed-indictment-granted-against-donald-trump/\">personal indictment of Donald Trump, granted while he was President of the United States</a>, &ndash; jointly reported here by myself and Claude Taylor, and the fact that this <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2017/05/29/donald-trump-sealed-indictment-started-with-eric-schneiderman/\">indictment was for RICO with Mr. Sater, Bayrock</a> and the Trump Organization &ndash; a story to this reporter alone &ndash; has dominated debate long after that election. A terrified Mr. Sater now appears to be trying to hurt Bob Mueller&rsquo;s other cases with disclosures and to be lobbying Trump for a pardon he cannot give at the same time. This is not the sound of whistleblowing; it is the sound of a stuck pig, squealing.</p>\n<h3>If you enjoy Patribotics, please <strong><a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\">consider a donation here </a>.

                "text": "Earlier this week, Buzzfeed published a large number of emails relating to the Trump Tower Moscow deal that Donald Trump was trying to set up with Michael Cohen. Parts of them had been published before in the New York Times, but the completeness of this dump was certainly new. The online publication also provided a useful timeline at the side of its story.\nIt seems relatively clear that Felix Sater himself was a source, if not the source, on this story. An enormous number of emails were addressed to or from him, something that the publication does not seek to hide, choosing to redact only actual email addresses and phone numbers in many cases. The story did not get as much traction online as you might expect, a consequence perhaps both of the Office of the Special Counsel correcting its authors earlier assertion that it was in possession of apparently non-existent documents showing that Donald Trump ordered Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. One of the authors, Anthony Cormier, denied having personally seen these documents, whereas his co-author Jason Leopold said that they had both seen them. Cormier declined to explain when the discrepancy was put to him on \u2018Reliable Sources\u2019 and the anchor, Brian Stelter, did not follow up or press him on the point. This inconsistent explanation for the reporting, which was followed by mass firings at Buzzfeed, may have dampened reactions to what should have been another ostensibly huge story.\nThe social media hive mind pounced on the undisclosed elements of the releases, which involve VTB and, I suggest, implicate VEB \u2018off stage\u2019. But the lack of amazement, of celebration of Sater as a \u2018whistleblower\u2019, will not have pleased him. Surely Mr. Sater felt the need to get these documents out there \u2013 and to a friendly news site.\nFelix Sater\u2019s Relationship With Buzzfeed\nUnlike the controversial article which was corrected by Bob Mueller, where only Leopold claimed the authors saw the alleged documents at its heart, a story which can be mostly ascribed, therefore, to Leopold, Felix Sater is principally Anthony Cormier\u2019s friend and source. The pair\u2019s story \u201cTrump Moscow: The Definitive Story of How Trump\u2019s Team Worked The Russian Deal During The Campaign\u201d has a URL that shows it was filed by Cormier. Cormier is bylined on a frankly ridiculous story that seeks to defend Felix Sater as, get this, an \u2018American spy.\u2019\nIn the sprawling Trump-Russia investigation, one name constantly pops up: Felix Sater. In story after story, Sater is described as Donald Trump\u2019s former business partner, a convicted stock swindler who was born in the Soviet Union, worked in Russia, tried to win Trump a deal in Moscow, and even helped broker a Ukrainian peace plan that Vladimir Putin would have loved.\nBasically, he\u2019s portrayed as something just short of a Russian spy.\nEffectively, he has been a spy \u2014 but for the United States.\nThis is an hilariously bad piece of \u2018trust washing\u2019 that attempts to convince the public that the man who was conspiring with Putin to elect Trump, in his own words, is somehow one of the good guys. Sater was an FBI asset, a \u2018dangle\u2019 , never a spy. He bombastically, and falsely, stated that he caught Osama Bin Laden. But Cormier\u2019s was not the only piece of \u2018trust washing\u2019 on Sater. A concerted PR effort can be seen, without too much trouble, when one reviews other pieces trying to sanitize this two-bit mobster; they all follow the same lines: \u2018Hey, did you know that Felix Sater was an informant for the FBI?\u201d The conspiracy theorists Who What Why, a website run by Russ Baker, a man that said the Bushes did 9/11, have been desperately trying to spin for Sater, and at the same time, make the case that the fact he once informed for the FBI not only gives Sater a pass, but actually stops Mueller from prosecuting Trump. Just after Comey was fired in May of 2017, Baker published a story entitled \u201cWHY FBI CAN\u2019T TELL ALL ON TRUMP, RUSSIA\u201d, which tried to make the case that\nthe FBI\u2019s Russia investigation was compromised because it could interfere with the Bureau\u2019s objective of fighting organized crime originating in the former Soviet Union\nSure, Jan\nand all because of Felix Sater, whom Who What Why then tried to whitewash in many more articles, always making the case that because the FBI trusted him once, he was somehow now inviolate. Sater pitched the line that he was a sacred, untouchable FBI informant to other outlets \u2013 who were, thankfully, more skeptical than Buzzfeed or Who What Why. The LA Times said for example that:\nSater\u2019s lawyer, Robert W. Wolf, gives his client more credit, saying he worked with \u201cnumerous U.S. national security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\u201d Sater says he helped hunt \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest enemies\u201d in Afghanistan and elsewhere.\nThere is no independent verification of those assertions.\nFormer CIA officials who worked in counter-terrorism and Russian affairs said they never heard of Sater and doubt his cloak-and-dagger claims of chasing down terrorists.\nSater laid relatively quiet after his triumphant Buzzfeed hagiography. Anthony Cormier, its author, had, without declaring it in the article, taken Mr. Sater out socializing to drinks and dinner parties in Manhattan before it was published. For Felix Sater, this partying appeared to be part of a strategy to use the media as his defense.\nSater did seem absolutely determined to ensure he was falsely portrayed as a cooperating witness, as a friend to the media and liberal establishments. Sater tried to get himself photographed hanging out with as many of the \u2018resistor\u2019 and media elite as possible.\nOnline, Sater boasted of his links to journalism and was, inexplicably, invited to speak at multiple journalism schools. His exchanges with this reporter were less cordial. When I pointed out to some of the alt-left whom they were hanging out with, Mr. Sater sent me a link to to the Buzzfeed piece authored by his social partner Mr. Cormier who had taken Sater to the dinner party. we were discussing.\nYahoo Broke the Trump Tower Moscow Story\nIt seems not unreasonable then to assume that the vast dumps of emails on Trump Tower came not from \u2018investigative journalism\u2019 but simply from Sater handing them over to be published by a friendly outlet. Cormier and Leopold received a great many plaudits for their story in May 2018, the \u201cdefinitive story\u201d of Trump Tower Moscow. In retrospect, however, the story was indeed definitive and exhaustive merely because Sater had given them his emails. The story, however, was not at all broken by Leopold and Cormier. The news that Trump Tower Moscow had gone on longer than admitted by Donald Trump or Michael Cohen was broken in an exclusive report by Yahoo News\u2019 Hunter Walker and Brett Arnold on May 16th.\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\nThe next day, Felix Sater dumped on their exclusive by giving the actual documents to Buzzfeed. It is clear from the Walker-Arnold piece that Sater admitted to them the documents existed, but only after they learned of their existence from multiple sources in Congress. The authors say Sater \u201cconfirmed\u201d to them what they had already learned through their reporting. It\u2019s also clear that they did not have possession of the emails.\nMultiple sources have described to Yahoo News the texts and emails with Cohen that Sater has provided to the government. Sater confirmed to Yahoo News that he provided all of his texts and emails with Cohen to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team as well as to the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate\u2019s Intelligence and Judiciary committees.\nThe emails and texts described to Yahoo News, which have not previously been made public\nAfter Yahoo\u2019s Walker and Arnold broke the news of these documents, Mr. Sater, who whatever his other shortcomings appears to have a flair for PR, worked with Cormier and Leopold so they could publish their much longer \u201cdefinitive\u201d Trump Tower Moscow piece. In retrospect, it is clear that this piece was based on Sater simply handing over his emails to the journalists. They quote extensively from them. Cormier and Leopold made a deeply ungenerous reference to Walker and Arnold\u2019s breaking of the news in their prologue:\nWhile fragments of the Trump Moscow venture have trickled out \u2014 most recently in a report last night by Yahoo News \u2014 this is the definitive story of the Moscow tower\nThe authors then attempt to pretend that their sources were \u2018two FBI agents\u2019 while not admitting that their actual source was, quite simply, their friend Felix Sater, who\u2019d given them the documents whose existence Walker and Arnold had discovered through independent, investigative reporting. It is important at this moment to understand that even while Sater was partying with the left and positioning himself as a media player, he was, throughout, shilling for Donald Trump and denying collusion with Russia. His actions were designed to damage, not support, Mueller\u2019s investigation. At the Manhattan dinner party to which Anthony Cormier took him, Sater posed with a bottle of wine labeled \u201cCollusion\u201d (yes, really) that he described as being \u201cweak, like the investigation\u201d. When he jumped into my conversation with somebody else and I replied \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you, traitor,\u201d Mr. Sater sent me a meme of a therapist asking an insane patient \u201cIs the Russian collusion in the room with us\u2026 right now?\u201d\nWhen the independent journalist Wendy Siegelman noted Sater\u2019s intense PR blitz, Sater replied with a triumphant meme of Leonardo di Caprio \u2018So much more to come\u2019.\nWhy then is Mr. Sater now choosing to have all his emails published in such meticulous detail? The earlier \u201cdefinitive Trump Moscow\u201d story he sourced got most of the substance out. What could be the hurry now in terms of making sure every email sees the light of day?\nDoes Mueller\u2019s Mystery Case Involve Trump\u2019s RICO Indictment, and is Sater Running Scared?\nIn a previous article, I laid out the runners and riders for the Mueller \u2018mystery witness\u2019 case, where my own bet is that the subject is VEB. Whether I am right or wrong, Mr. Sater may agree with me that the subject is a Russian bank. Here are some things we can say for certain:\nThe case is very important, receiving certiorari in the Supreme Court \u2013 although clearly that may mean that the point of law, rather than the actors involved, are important\nThe case impacts national security and is likely to involve important actors because, distinct from the \u2018importance via certiorari\u2019 point, the courthouse authorities took extraordinary steps to conceal the identity of the appellant from reporters\nThe \u2018mystery case\u2019 entity and associated amicus briefs are, by definition, not the subject of this specific Mueller case. Mr. Mueller is trying to subpoena a witness in his case. The sovereign financial entity is not accused of a crime in this case. Its data, that it is resisting handing over, is merely \u2018witness evidence\u2019 to the crime committed by the completely unknown target of the case.\nPatribotics has reported exclusively that Donald Trump is personally indicted, under seal, on RICO charges along with Felix Sater, the Trump Organization and Bayrock.\nPatribotics is grateful for the support of our readers, which makes our journalism possible. If you can help us, please donate.\nIs it possible that VEB, the state-run entity, is being subpoenaed for records that relate to some of Felix Sater\u2019s funders on the Trump Organization-Bayrock deal? VEB might have records on transfers made to VTB, the commercial Russian bank involved in the Bayrock deal; or to Sergei Kislyak, whom, Felix Sater\u2019s chosen messenger Jason Leopold reported,\nThe first Trump sealed indictment, I exclusively reported, had its genesis in a state Enterprise Corruption case from Eric Schneiderman, when he was the Attorney General of New York, I also reported that Schneiderman had had Trump Tower under state surveillance for well over a year \u2013 something that would not require a FISA warrant for AG Schneiderman to do. I reported, still further, that Paul Manafort, who promised \u2018cooperation\u2019 with the FBI before allowing a \u2018by consent\u2019 search of his apartment at Trump Tower, had lied to the FBI about what was there, cleaning out his apartment in advance and removing items to Florida.\nBloomberg reported with a clear-eyed view on Sater, Bayrock and Trump:\nIn that context, a troubling history of Trump\u2019s dealings with Russians exists outside of Russia: in a dormant real-estate development firm, the Bayrock Group, which once operated just two floors beneath the president\u2019s own office in Trump Tower.\nBayrock partnered with the future president and his two eldest children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, on a series of real-estate deals between 2002 and about 2011, the most prominent being the troubled Trump Soho hotel and condominium in Manhattan.\nDuring the years that Bayrock and Trump did deals together, the company was also a bridge between murky European funding and a number of projects in the U.S. to which the president once lent his name in exchange for handsome fees. Icelandic banks that dealt with Bayrock, for example, were easy marks for money launderers and foreign influence, according to interviews with government investigators, legislators, and others in Reykjavik, Brussels, Paris and London. Trump testified under oath in a 2007 deposition that Bayrock brought Russian investors to his Trump Tower office to discuss deals in Moscow, and said he was pondering investing there.\nOne of Bayrock\u2019s principals was a career criminal named Felix Sater who had ties to Russian and American organized crime groups. Before linking up with the company and with Trump, he had worked as a mob informant for the U.S. government, fled to Moscow to avoid criminal charges while boasting of his KGB and Kremlin contacts there, and had gone to prison for slashing apart another man\u2019s face with a broken cocktail glass.\nIn a series of interviews and a lawsuit, a former Bayrock insider, Jody Kriss, claims that he eventually departed from the firm because he became convinced that Bayrock was actually a front for money laundering.\nLet us then cross-reference this with some other facts. Has Mr. Sater got wind that, no matter how many public relations pieces he places with Buzzfeed or Newsweek, US intelligence does not regard him as \u201cAn American Spy\u201d and is about to unseal charges on him, personally, for RICO? My reporting is that the first sealed indictment on Donald Trump as a person is for RICO, that the Trump Organization is indicted as a corrupt organization, and that the specific case was that of Felix Sater and Bayrock. Sater\u2019s motivation might then have been to warn his masters in Russia of some of what Mueller has on them; or to lobby Trump for a pardon. This money laundering by Sater and Trump with the Trump Organization pre-dated the election campaign of 2016. But the pre-Mueller, personal indictment of Donald Trump, granted while he was President of the United States, \u2013 jointly reported here by myself and Claude Taylor, and the fact that this indictment was for RICO with Mr. Sater, Bayrock and the Trump Organization \u2013 a story to this reporter alone \u2013 has dominated debate long after that election. A terrified Mr. Sater now appears to be trying to hurt Bob Mueller\u2019s other cases with disclosures and to be lobbying Trump for a pardon he cannot give at the same time. This is not the sound of whistleblowing; it is the sound of a stuck pig, squealing.\nIf you enjoy Patribotics, please consider a donation here . We rely on your help to keep going!",

Kushner then changed US foreign policy to benefit himself, punishing Qatar and rewarding Saudi Arabia when the former refused the bribe and the latter paid up, these sources said.</p>\n<p>According to these sources, Kushner asked both Qatar and Saudi Arabia to invest in his troubled real estate empire. Qatar initially refused; Saudi Arabia agreed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you enjoy our reporting, please consider a <a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\">donation</a>. Patribotics is totally reader-supported. Thank you for keeping us going!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Following these meetings, sources said, Mr. Kushner changed US foreign policy in order to benefit himself. The long-standing policy of neutrality between Qatar and Saudi Arabia was altered and Saudi Arabia was permitted to blockade Qatar &ndash; despite the United States forward headquarters for CENTCOM being<a href=\"http://www.centcom.mil/AREA-OF-RESPONSIBILITY/Qatar/\"> located there</a>.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/06/qatar-panic-buying-as-shoppers-stockpile-food-due-to-saudi-blockade\">tweeted</a> against Qatar and in favor of Saudi Arabia imposing the blockade as Kushner changed US foreign policy to enrich himself.</p>\n<p>If these sources are correct, as I <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2018/10/18/are-saudi-arabia-blackmailing-trump-over-donald-jr-and-jared-kushner/\">reported earlier</a>, this would explain why Jared Kushner has been seen befriending the murderer of Jamal Khashoggi, Mohammed Bin Salman. Bin Salman knows that Kushner extorted him for money, and can threaten to tell the Special Counsel this, keeping Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump, and by extension Donald Trump, at his mercy. However, <a href=\"https://spectator.us/beware-ides-trump/\">public reporting suggests</a> the Mueller report is imminent, and these sources said that Mueller&rsquo;s office is well aware of extortion practiced by Mr. Kushner, and by other members of the Trump family. As we reported earlier:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Kushner is the administration&rsquo;s so-called Middle East expert, a job for which Trump granted a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jared-kushner-lacks-security-clearance-level-to-review-some-of-the-nations-most-sensitive-intelligence-in-white-house-role/2018/07/12/10fae2ac-8537-11e8-9e80-403a221946a7_story.html?utm_term=.74a493366ddf\">basic security clearance</a> after Chief of Staff John Kelly had it <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/security-clearances-downgraded-for-kushner-and-other-white-house-officials/2018/02/27/106d763c-1c01-11e8-9de1-147dd2df3829_story.html?utm_term=.8412d954b230\">downgraded</a>from TS/SCI to &lsquo;Secret&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>The White House reviewed the background investigation by the FBI on Kushner and then granted &lsquo;Top Secret&rsquo; clearance, which it has the right to do whatever the FBI report says; but the CIA prevented Kushner from regaining the TS/SCI clearance that Kelly effectively stripped from him. The stripping followed <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/03/21/jared-kushner-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman/\">accusations</a> that Kushner had given names of MBS opponents taken from the Presidential Daily Briefing to MBS in Saudi Arabia, which resulted in the Prince&rsquo;s torture purge of his opponents.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It was revealed this week in the New York Times that General Kelly was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/us/politics/jared-kushner-security-clearance.html\">overruled by Donald Trump</a> who insisted on granting a security clearance to Jared Kushner despite General Kelly&rsquo;s actions, and the recommendations of the FBI and the CIA.</p>\n<p><em>If you enjoy Patribotics, please <strong>consider a <a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\">donation here </a>. </strong>We need your help to keep going!</em></p>\n<ul><li><figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.reddit.com/static/button/button1.html?newwindow=true&width=120&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpatribotics.blog%2F2019%2F03%2F07%2Fexclusive-kushner-extorted-qatar-us-foreign-policy%2F&title=Exclusive%3A%20Kushner%20%27Extorted%20Qatar%27%20With%20US%20Foreign%20Policy\"></iframe></figure></li></ul>",

Kushner then changed US foreign policy to benefit himself, punishing Qatar and rewarding Saudi Arabia when the former refused the bribe and the latter paid up, these sources said.\nAccording to these sources, Kushner asked both Qatar and Saudi Arabia to invest in his troubled real estate empire. Qatar initially refused; Saudi Arabia agreed.\nIf you enjoy our reporting, please consider a donation. Patribotics is totally reader-supported. Thank you for keeping us going!\nFollowing these meetings, sources said, Mr. Kushner changed US foreign policy in order to benefit himself. The long-standing policy of neutrality between Qatar and Saudi Arabia was altered and Saudi Arabia was permitted to blockade Qatar \u2013 despite the United States forward headquarters for CENTCOM being located there.\nDonald Trump also tweeted against Qatar and in favor of Saudi Arabia imposing the blockade as Kushner changed US foreign policy to enrich himself.\nIf these sources are correct, as I reported earlier, this would explain why Jared Kushner has been seen befriending the murderer of Jamal Khashoggi, Mohammed Bin Salman. Bin Salman knows that Kushner extorted him for money, and can threaten to tell the Special Counsel this, keeping Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump, and by extension Donald Trump, at his mercy. However, public reporting suggests the Mueller report is imminent, and these sources said that Mueller\u2019s office is well aware of extortion practiced by Mr. Kushner, and by other members of the Trump family. As we reported earlier:\n\u201cKushner is the administration\u2019s so-called Middle East expert, a job for which Trump granted a basic security clearance after Chief of Staff John Kelly had it downgradedfrom TS/SCI to \u2018Secret\u2019.\nThe White House reviewed the background investigation by the FBI on Kushner and then granted \u2018Top Secret\u2019 clearance, which it has the right to do whatever the FBI report says; but the CIA prevented Kushner from regaining the TS/SCI clearance that Kelly effectively stripped from him. The stripping followed accusations that Kushner had given names of MBS opponents taken from the Presidential Daily Briefing to MBS in Saudi Arabia, which resulted in the Prince\u2019s torture purge of his opponents.\u201d\nIt was revealed this week in the New York Times that General Kelly was overruled by Donald Trump who insisted on granting a security clearance to Jared Kushner despite General Kelly\u2019s actions, and the recommendations of the FBI and the CIA.\nIf you enjoy Patribotics, please consider a donation here .

Sirota being paid by the Sanders camp not only to attack Democrats, but also to defend Russia? Conversely, what Russia-aligned groups, including the Young Turks &ndash; a &ldquo;fake opposition&rdquo; group that loves Russia and is <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/04/buddy-roemer-firm-invests-4-million-in-young-turks-network-186934\">funded by Republican Bobby Roehmer</a> &ndash; have paid Sirota to smear the FBI, attack America and defend Russia? He was working for Sanders when the Republican-backed group published this attack on the Democratic Party:</p>\n<p>Has Mr. Sirota registered as a foreign agent for Russia under the FARA laws, as he is required to do if he has taken money &ndash; or indeed knowingly distributed propaganda on behalf of any foreign principal. The law <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2009-title22/pdf/USCODE-2009-title22-chap11-subchapII.pdf\">does not require</a> a foreign agent be paid. In fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=from%3Awikileaks%20%40DavidSirota&src=typd\">here&rsquo;s</a> Mr. Sirota <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=from%3Awikileaks%20%40DavidSirota&src=typd\">working with Wikileaks</a>, from 2013 onwards.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Patribotics needs your support to keep going. If you can support our work, <a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\">please consider donating</a>. With your help, we can continue to expose Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s attack on America.<br></p></blockquote>\n<p>But perhaps Sirota should be most worried about his knowing distribution of <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/control/2013/03/06/hugo_chavezs_economic_miracle/?curator=MediaREDEF\">foreign propaganda</a>. There is indeed an exemption under the FARA laws for journalists. However, lying, as Sirota has done, that he was a journalist even as he was a hired, paid, PR boy for Bernie Sanders, does more than harm both him and the Sanders campaign over their lack of ethics. It removes from Sirota the claim to have been a journalist in good faith. He is a propagandist, and a propagandist for the Russian state, including Guccifer 2 and Wikileaks. Taking the job with Bernie Sanders while pretending to still be a journalist may wind up costing Mr. Sirota more than merely his reputation.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"8375\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"unknown\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/patribotics.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unknown.jpeg?fit=274%2C184&ssl=1\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/patribotics.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unknown.jpeg?resize=308%2C207&is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/patribotics.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unknown.jpeg?fit=274%2C184&ssl=1\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/patribotics.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unknown.jpeg?fit=274%2C184&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"274,184\" data-permalink=\"https://patribotics.blog/unknown/\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/patribotics.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unknown.jpeg?fit=274%2C184&ssl=1\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img><figcaption>Figures.</figcaption></figure>\n<blockquote><p>If you enjoy our reporting, please consider a <a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\">donation</a>.

Journalist Edward Isaac-Dovere broke that story in The Atlantic.\nSince December, David Sirota has, on Twitter, on his own website, and in columns in The Guardian, been trashing most of Sanders\u2019s Democratic opponents\u2014all without disclosing his work with Sanders\u2026\nThe Atlantic, and many outraged commenters on Twitter, highlighted Sirota\u2019s complete lack of ethics. One glaring lie that most seem to have missed: Sirota, after attacking Neera Tanden of Think Progress for her former work for Debbie Wasserman Schulz, was asked in December \u201cWhen did you work for Bernie Sanders?\u201d\n\u201c1999,\u201d he lied. \u201cWorked for House Dems in 2001, and CAP in 2003. This is all on my website.\u201d\nHe was, in fact, working for Sanders as he typed out that falsehood. In fact, Sarah Huckabee Sanders could not have lied with a straight face any better than David Sirota. But Mr. Sirota has a worse problem than being outed as an unethical PR flack faking being a journalist.\nPatribotics is grateful for the support of our readers, which makes our reporting possible. Your support will help us to break more stories on Trump and Russia in 2019. Please consider a donation here\nDavid Sirota\u2019s Pro-Russian Activism\nBernie Sanders has admitted that he knew that Russian bots and trolls \u2013 the notorious \u2018Bernie Bros\u2019 \u2013 were helping him in 2016. Mueller will certainly be interested; he is non-partisan when it comes to Russian interference. One of the first investigations Mueller handed off to other federal prosecutors involved ostensible Democrats \u2013 Tony Podesta, former Obama White House Counsel Greg Craig of the now notorious Skadden, Arps law firm, and Republican Vin Weber. In fact, Podesta may have been the first referral we know of \u2013 CNN reported \u201cone of the matters, involving Podesta, was referred to SDNY by Mueller\u2019s team shortly before the FBI executed searches of Cohen\u2019s home, office and hotel room in early April [2018].\u201d\nBernie Sanders certainly was beloved by Vladimir Putin. As we have noted elsewhere on Patribotics, a raft of the most famous Trump trolls online \u2013 Cassandra Fairbanks, Jack Posobiec and Anthime Gionnet, better known as \u2018Baked Alaska\u2019, were all using pro-Bernie personae before switching, as a bloc, to Donald Trump. The other thing all of them had in common was fealty to the Russian state. Conversely, one of the most notorious pro-Russian trolls on social media, Sameera Khan, was a spokeswoman for Sanders before moving on to Russia Today.\nWith all of Bernie Sanders previously known links to Russia \u2013 Paul Manafort\u2019s partner Tad Devine actually ran the Sanders campaign \u2013 you might think he would steer clear of Russia shills during his 2020 campaign. But you would be wrong.\nDavid Sirota is a huge fan of Russia and has, at every turn, minimized its attack on America. This reporter challenged him on Twitter in what now seems a very one-sided conversation, as Mr. Sirota has deleted all his Russia-related tweets. Fortunately, I archived many of them for Patribotics, and it\u2019s quite the collection of Putin apologism:\nFor journalists, the question then arises: was Sirota being paid by the Sanders camp not only to attack Democrats, but also to defend Russia? Conversely, what Russia-aligned groups, including the Young Turks \u2013 a \u201cfake opposition\u201d group that loves Russia and is funded by Republican Bobby Roehmer \u2013 have paid Sirota to smear the FBI, attack America and defend Russia? He was working for Sanders when the Republican-backed group published this attack on the Democratic Party:\nHas Mr. Sirota registered as a foreign agent for Russia under the FARA laws, as he is required to do if he has taken money \u2013 or indeed knowingly distributed propaganda on behalf of any foreign principal. The law does not require a foreign agent be paid. In fact, here\u2019s Mr. Sirota working with Wikileaks, from 2013 onwards.\nPatribotics needs your support to keep going. If you can support our work, please consider donating. With your help, we can continue to expose Vladimir Putin\u2019s attack on America.\nBut perhaps Sirota should be most worried about his knowing distribution of foreign propaganda. There is indeed an exemption under the FARA laws for journalists. However, lying, as Sirota has done, that he was a journalist even as he was a hired, paid, PR boy for Bernie Sanders, does more than harm both him and the Sanders campaign over their lack of ethics. It removes from Sirota the claim to have been a journalist in good faith. He is a propagandist, and a propagandist for the Russian state, including Guccifer 2 and Wikileaks. Taking the job with Bernie Sanders while pretending to still be a journalist may wind up costing Mr. Sirota more than merely his reputation.\nIf you enjoy our reporting, please consider a donation.

This strongly suggests that while the OSC fought, and won, their case against the Mystery Appellant, that the person or entity against whom the Mystery Appellant was to be a witness is <em>not being prosecuted by OSC</em>. That case, it would seem, continues. And taken together, this must mean that Mueller had an overall interest in the case, but was <em>not himself prosecuting it</em>. The facts are at least compatible with a scenario in which Mueller referred a US person to another federal office for prosecution, and then a foreign-owned company witness refused to comply with the Grand Jury&rsquo;s subpoena for information in the case.</p>\n<p>Of course, it also suggests &ndash; again supporting this article&rsquo;s analysis &ndash; that although the &ldquo;Mueller Grand Jury&rdquo; is named after the Special Counsel, who convened it &ndash; that other federal prosecutors are using it to bring their prosecutions.</p>\n<p><em>Patribotics is grateful to our readers, who make this reporting possible. Your <a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\">support</a> helps hold Donald Trump to account. Please consider a </em><a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\">donation</a><em><a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\"> here</a></em></p>\n<p>In my last piece I <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2019/03/25/william-barrs-wonderful-letter/\">explained</a> why William Barr&rsquo;s letter was in fact not terrible, and constituted good news for foes of Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>This piece addresses what I believe to be one of the most fundamental misconceptions, indeed the foundational misconception, of the world-wide news reporting that Mueller has cleared Trump and his team of collusion with Russia.</p>\n<p>It is the mistaken idea that any sealed indictments that remain at other prosecutorial offices must be on ancillary matters &ndash; they can&rsquo;t be on the substance. Mueller&rsquo;s remit was to investigate collusion with Trump and Russia, so the assumption goes. That was his core mission. So, while money laundering and other crimes might be passed off, it&rsquo;s Mueller&rsquo;s office itself that would prosecute collusion.</p>\n<p>That idea is false.</p>\n<h3><em>If you enjoy our reporting, please consider a </em><a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\">donation</a><em>. Patribotics is totally reader-supported. Thank you for keeping us going!</em></h3>\n<p>As I pointed out last time, Jim Comey had testified that he was &lsquo;working with two main sets of prosecutors &ndash; EDVA and Main Justice, National Security Division.&rsquo; That was the normal practice of the investigation which Mueller took over and I believe there is ample evidence that it remained Mueller&rsquo;s practice. As any case on the Trump-Russia substance, involving a US person came up, Mueller referred it to another prosecuting office than his own.</p>\n<p>Why would he farm off the prosecutions to his main duty? To protect his main duty, to investigate and produce a report.</p>\n<h3>Protecting the Investigation </h3>\n<p>Firstly, Trump Russia collusion is, necessarily, a conspiracy. Prosecuting cases piecemeal reveals details of other classified cases. It would also reveal part of Mueller&rsquo;s report, spoiling the whole. So why would OSC itself not indict under seal? Common sense dictates that had Donald Trump seen 43 sealed indictments listed from the Special Counsel or attributed by leaks to the Special Counsel, he would shut down the probe or interfere in its work. Clearly the most practical course for Mueller would be to refer cases to other prosecutors continuing Comey&rsquo;s normal practice. A large number of *pending sealed cases* remain at the federal DC court, and they were referred in 2018.</p>\n<h3>Protecting the Report</h3>\n<p>Mueller&rsquo;s main job, as Jim Comey said when theorizing about how a Special Counsel would work, was to oversee the investigation, as a whole. As the prosecutions and sealed indictments racked up (I believe), Mueller continued to write his report. If he additionally had to prepare 43 separate prosecutions (for example) the report would never be delivered.</p>\n<h3>Barr Is Not Playing Games But Adhering to the Rules</h3>\n<p>I have heard it said that it would be &ldquo;too cute&rdquo; for Barr to say that &ldquo;no OSC sealed indictments remain&rdquo; when Trump Russia sealed indictments exist by the dozen, as I have reported, elsewhere. But that is not true. The AG cannot comment on a sealed indictment that is pending. It is sealed. He cannot comment on pending cases, or prejudice a jury. Just because he is both allowed and mandated to talk about the Mueller Report, he is <em>not </em>allowed to talk about prosecutions filed under seal at other offices. Barr is sticking to the rules.</p>\n<h3>Why These Indictments Are Still Sealed </h3>\n<p>It is, again, not for any nefarious purpose. It is simply because Mueller&rsquo;s report, which needs to be cleared of Grand Jury information, has not yet gone to Congress. There is no basis for the current fear that Barr will not supply it. These indictments are on the substance. They reveal what is in the Mueller Report. Therefore, they cannot be unsealed until Congress has read it.</p>\n<p>This story will be updated tomorrow.</p>\n<p><em>Please consider a </em><a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\">donation to Patribotics <em>here</em></a></p>\n<ul><li><figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.reddit.com/static/button/button1.html?newwindow=true&width=120&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpatribotics.blog%2F2019%2F03%2F26%2Fthe-media-is-missing-muellers-method%2F&title=The%20Media%20is%20Missing%20Mueller%27s%20Method\"></iframe></figure></li></ul>",

                "text": "Update: My analysis has received a major boost from the news today that the Grand Jury in the \u2018mystery appellant\u2019 case \u201ccontinues robustly\u201d, despite the end of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation. This strongly suggests that while the OSC fought, and won, their case against the Mystery Appellant, that the person or entity against whom the Mystery Appellant was to be a witness is not being prosecuted by OSC. That case, it would seem, continues. And taken together, this must mean that Mueller had an overall interest in the case, but was not himself prosecuting it. The facts are at least compatible with a scenario in which Mueller referred a US person to another federal office for prosecution, and then a foreign-owned company witness refused to comply with the Grand Jury\u2019s subpoena for information in the case.\nOf course, it also suggests \u2013 again supporting this article\u2019s analysis \u2013 that although the \u201cMueller Grand Jury\u201d is named after the Special Counsel, who convened it \u2013 that other federal prosecutors are using it to bring their prosecutions.\nPatribotics is grateful to our readers, who make this reporting possible. Your support helps hold Donald Trump to account. Please consider a donation here\nIn my last piece I explained why William Barr\u2019s letter was in fact not terrible, and constituted good news for foes of Donald Trump.\nThis piece addresses what I believe to be one of the most fundamental misconceptions, indeed the foundational misconception, of the world-wide news reporting that Mueller has cleared Trump and his team of collusion with Russia.\nIt is the mistaken idea that any sealed indictments that remain at other prosecutorial offices must be on ancillary matters \u2013 they can\u2019t be on the substance. Mueller\u2019s remit was to investigate collusion with Trump and Russia, so the assumption goes. That was his core mission. So, while money laundering and other crimes might be passed off, it\u2019s Mueller\u2019s office itself that would prosecute collusion.\nThat idea is false.\nIf you enjoy our reporting, please consider a donation. Patribotics is totally reader-supported. Thank you for keeping us going!\nAs I pointed out last time, Jim Comey had testified that he was \u2018working with two main sets of prosecutors \u2013 EDVA and Main Justice, National Security Division.\u2019 That was the normal practice of the investigation which Mueller took over and I believe there is ample evidence that it remained Mueller\u2019s practice. As any case on the Trump-Russia substance, involving a US person came up, Mueller referred it to another prosecuting office than his own.\nWhy would he farm off the prosecutions to his main duty? To protect his main duty, to investigate and produce a report.\nProtecting the Investigation\nFirstly, Trump Russia collusion is, necessarily, a conspiracy. Prosecuting cases piecemeal reveals details of other classified cases. It would also reveal part of Mueller\u2019s report, spoiling the whole. So why would OSC itself not indict under seal? Common sense dictates that had Donald Trump seen 43 sealed indictments listed from the Special Counsel or attributed by leaks to the Special Counsel, he would shut down the probe or interfere in its work. Clearly the most practical course for Mueller would be to refer cases to other prosecutors continuing Comey\u2019s normal practice. A large number of *pending sealed cases* remain at the federal DC court, and they were referred in 2018.\nProtecting the Report\nMueller\u2019s main job, as Jim Comey said when theorizing about how a Special Counsel would work, was to oversee the investigation, as a whole. As the prosecutions and sealed indictments racked up (I believe), Mueller continued to write his report. If he additionally had to prepare 43 separate prosecutions (for example) the report would never be delivered.\nBarr Is Not Playing Games But Adhering to the Rules\nI have heard it said that it would be \u201ctoo cute\u201d for Barr to say that \u201cno OSC sealed indictments remain\u201d when Trump Russia sealed indictments exist by the dozen, as I have reported, elsewhere. But that is not true. The AG cannot comment on a sealed indictment that is pending. It is sealed. He cannot comment on pending cases, or prejudice a jury. Just because he is both allowed and mandated to talk about the Mueller Report, he is not allowed to talk about prosecutions filed under seal at other offices. Barr is sticking to the rules.\nWhy These Indictments Are Still Sealed\nIt is, again, not for any nefarious purpose. It is simply because Mueller\u2019s report, which needs to be cleared of Grand Jury information, has not yet gone to Congress. There is no basis for the current fear that Barr will not supply it. These indictments are on the substance. They reveal what is in the Mueller Report. Therefore, they cannot be unsealed until Congress has read it.\nThis story will be updated tomorrow.\nPlease consider a donation to Patribotics here",

The New York Times, downplaying it for all it was worth, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/us/politics/william-barr-mueller-report.html\">reluctantly admitted </a>that these prosecutors had told colleagues that Barr&rsquo;s initial non-summary appeared to &lsquo;downplay&rsquo; their report. They had provided summaries for release which Barr didn&rsquo;t use. The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal soon confirmed.</p>\n<p>In my last piece I discussed &lsquo;<a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2019/03/30/barrs-backtrack-a-read-on-the-redactions/\">Barr&rsquo;s Backtrack</a>&lsquo; and how he defensively maintained that his summary letter was not, in fact, a summary. Apparently, this blog, pretty much alone among American commentators (yep; I am taking a small victory lap) <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2019/03/25/william-barrs-wonderful-letter/\">correctly read the contents of his letter</a>; Barr&rsquo;s letter did not say there would be no further indictments, and, I correctly reported (again, alone in this analysis) that Barr had never said there was <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2019/03/29/barr-summary-whats-the-evidence-on-no-evidence/\">&ldquo;no evidence&rdquo; of collusion</a>.</p>\n<p>What seems clear, however, is that while I read the substance accurately, Mueller&rsquo;s team believes Barr was being clever with his legal word play not to safeguard trials (although that remains a consequence of it) but to spin a narrative, a narrative that got a false idea over to the public that Mueller cleared Trump and that no further indictments were coming.</p>\n<p>However, the Barr Backtrack also indicates that Mr. Barr&rsquo;s hat is in fact at worst a shade of gray. I can certainly put stock in what Mueller&rsquo;s team believes. But Barr, my own sources said at the time, was apprised by Mueller that he, Mueller, wished to refer for indictment all of the President&rsquo;s three eldest children, and Trump himself on obstruction. An &ldquo;unholy row&rdquo; was then reported by my sources and those of several other commentators. However, the &lsquo;row&rsquo; was over indicting Trump himself; as I reported (exclusively) Barr said &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to the <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2019/03/07/donald-trump-jr-eric-trump-ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-all-indicted/\">indictments of the three Trump kids and Jared Kushner for money laundering </a>offenses, but was wary of saying yes to the Trump indictment itself. I have speculated that Mueller agreed to punt the matter to Congress, and Barr then stuck his oar in. That looks bad for Barr&rsquo;s metaphorical headgear. However, Barr agreeing that Mueller could refer all of Trump&rsquo;s eldest children, and Jared Kushner, for indictment (as I report has happened) &ndash; well, that looks good for Barr; it looks like somebody who is not afraid to hurt the President in the course of pursuing the law.</p>\n<p>In life in general and in Trump Russia in particular, our longing for moral clarity pushes us all too often into &lsquo;black vs white&rsquo; stances. As a journalist, I can certainly see that Mueller prosecutors are angry with Barr. However, I also remember that before Barr&rsquo;s first &lsquo;non-summary summary&rsquo; letter, sources thought that Barr and Mueller were on the same side, and were very surprised at the letter. The podcaster and journalist Virginia Heffernan received <a href=\"https://twitter.com/page88/status/1109908926215176192\"> similar information from her own sources</a>. It is possible, and I write this with trepidation, that even Mueller&rsquo;s prosecutors have Barr&rsquo;s motivations wrong; that the IC was right the first time, and Barr is protecting forthcoming prosecutions. It&rsquo;s equally possible that Barr&rsquo;s heart is cold and icy as Siberia, and all he cares about is protecting Trump. However, if my sources are correct, the Attorney General did not stand in the way of a prosecution of people very close indeed to Trump. As to obstruction, it looks awful. Perhaps Barr simply lied about Rosenstein. But if Rod Rosenstein in truth concurred with Barr, I do not believe that Rod Rosenstein is a &lsquo;black hat&rsquo;. It can honestly be that even if Barr is pro-Trump and Rosenstein is pro-America, that they agreed, in this one case, on the law.</p>\n<p>The boring answer is &lsquo;we don&rsquo;t have enough data&rsquo;. But based on Barr&rsquo;s initial letter and sources saying he OKed the prosecution of all three Trump kids and Jared Kushner, it seems to this reporter as though the color of Barr&rsquo;s metaphorical &lsquo;hat&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t matter. Maybe he is indeed an enemy of the Republic, bent on a cover-up.

Barr&rsquo;s letter was greeted with <a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/these-tweets-about-william-barrs-mueller-report-summary-are-unsatisfied-with-the-letter-16980114\">shock</a> by many of those who believed that he was going to reveal coordination between President Trump&rsquo;s campaign and Russia. He did not. His brief summary was hailed as a total <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=24&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiO66SGm6PhAhVhh-AKHenIAugQFjAXegQIAhAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.cnbc.com%252F2019%252F03%252F24%252Fwhite-house-on-mueller-findings-total-and-complete-exoneration-of-president-trump.html&usg=AOvVaw1EGcJCca-A8m3QCJpW4Kz8\">exoneration</a> by the White House. For many information starved writers and the public in general seeking to vanquish a would-be autocrat or to vindicate a strong-man champion the desire to parse every word of Barr&rsquo;s brief letter in an attempt to understand as much as possible about Mueller&rsquo;s underlying report was insatiable. Hot takes, partisan press releases, editorials and explainers proliferated almost immediately.</p>\n<p>I break my analysis into multiple parts. First, I will examine Barr&rsquo;s history with the CIA and as Attorney General for President George H.W. Bush. Those segments of Barr&rsquo;s work history are currently being used as evidence that he is now acting with bad intent. I will also look at additional criticisms as well, and examine the desire for speed relating to the release of the full Mueller report. Next, I parse Barr&rsquo;s principled conclusion letter (summary) in the context framed by the notification to congress he sent hours after Special Counsel Mueller delivered his final report. In this section I will closely focus on the variations relating to who Barr references as targets of the investigation. In the following sections I examine how this letter was critically received focusing on the most damaging criticisms. I look at ideas posed by some attempting to make sense of Barr&rsquo;s summary with regards to information in the public record. I will focus briefly on the debate over redactions. Finally I look at the difference between an investigators view, an attorney general&rsquo;s view, and a long term constitutional view before engaging in a final analysis and conclusion.</p>\n<p><em>Patribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to </em><a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\"><strong>donate</strong></a><em>, there are buttons around the site, or you could </em><strong><a href=\"http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch\">make a contribution here. </a></strong></p>\n<p>My goal here is to differentiate between political difference, legal malfeasance, and nefarious intent. We can expect the Attorney General to fight to secure executive power, we can expect him to defend the office of the president as opposed to the man, and we can expect him to defend any president with regards to the lawful use of the powers granted to the office as he understands them. We can expect a level of partisanship with regards to policy and resource prioritization. However, if we want to depolarize our politics, we can and indeed must avoid attributing nefarious intent to conscientious civil servants doing their duty in suboptimal situations. There is a fundamental difference in stance, a difference between questioning Barr&rsquo;s actions assuming neutral or partisan motives versus assuming intent to engage in criminal activity without solid evidence and using that assumption as a guide to draw conclusions about actions. The latter leads to fractured politics and should be avoided when possible. That brings us back to the title, is Attorney General William Barr a white hat?</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/10/opinion/essay-iraqgate-whitewash.html\">Coverup General</a></h3>\n<p>Was Barr&rsquo;s decision to write a very short letter summarizing the conclusions of Mueller&rsquo;s report while working towards a more complete release indicative of a coverup or a good faith discretionary choice in a matter of grave national import? On this score, Barr was attacked from many angles. One of the key lines of attack is grounded in Barr&rsquo;s prior history prior history including his time at the CIA, advising President Reagan, and as Attorney General for President Bush. This history is used as evidence that his current summary letter was part of a <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/2019/03/stunning-history-william-barrs-crusade-bury-evidence-protect-republican-presidents/\">coverup</a>. But this line of attack is at best demonstrates the partisanship of a much younger and less experienced civil servant, not bad intent. It fails to take into consideration Barr&rsquo;s ethical obligations as an attorney or his specific role to protect the constitution by informing his actions with broad view of both history and of executive power.</p>\n<h3><em>CIA</em></h3>\n<p>Long before any of his alleged coverups took place Barr <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/attorney-general-nominee-barr-helped-navigate-cia-through-rocky-times-with-congress-11549974600\">worked</a> for the CIA beginning as an intern in 1971, then an intelligence analyst in 1973. In 1975 he transferred to the CIA&rsquo;s office of legislative counsel where his worked included acting as a liaison between the agency and congress during the period of time when two <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/investigations/ChurchCommittee.htm\">special</a> committee investigations into <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter98_99/art07.html\">intelligence</a> abuses were ongoing and that produced transformative reports. It&rsquo;s not difficult to imagine the key experiences he must have gained during those formative years in terms of understanding congressional politics, of the checks and balances involved in the struggle between the executive and the legislative branches of our government, and of the enormity of the threats facing America during the Vietnam War while also in the middle of the Cold War. He worked for an agency tasked with countering the threats of communist governments in both China and Russia, threats he would see play out through Russia&rsquo;s attempted expansion into <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter98_99/art07.html\">Central America</a> during the Cold War and its continued <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/politics/foreign/front.htm\">threat after</a> the implosion of the Soviet Union. Threats he would see play out in China&rsquo;s support for a communist takeover in Vietnam. As a trained analyst he had direct knowledge of Russia&rsquo;s basic tactics and capabilities. As a legislative liaison during a period where congress was investigating the executive branch, he had a parallel understanding of the weaknesses in our own constitutional republic &ndash; weaknesses that could be exploited by savvy hostile actors.</p>\n<h3><em>Presidents Reagan and Bush</em></h3>\n<p>It is within the context of the former CIA employee who supported intelligence operations in the ongoing <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300136241/spy-wars\">spy wars</a> between the US and the former Soviet Union that we should understand his role in fighting for executive power. Such a fight, spanning multiple presidential administrations is not a fight for a particular president or party. It&rsquo;s a fight for the office of the president. To do otherwise results in contradictions. For example, is problematic to view Barr as pro-Russian espionage or pro-coverup given his CIA history and work for both President&rsquo;s Reagan and Bush. A more consistent interpretation of his legal advice during that period is to see it in the light of the struggle between executive and congressional power. In this light his role was to fight for America by aiding both Reagan and Bush&rsquo;s negotiate legal issues that resulted from the use of executive power related to their ongoing broader efforts to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/reagan-iran/\">rescue hostages</a> and open dialogue with Iran, contain Russian influence in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4948068\">Central America</a> during the Cold War, <a href=\"https://millercenter.org/president/george-h-w-bush/key-events\">negotiate</a> with Russia to end the Cold War, and to reduce nuclear arms and protect national security related interests with regard to American oil investments in the Middle East. From another angle, nothing in his advice during either administration indicates he sought anything further than a preservation of the executive power to quickly or creatively act against perceived, intelligence validated threats, or to act on diplomatic opportunities &ndash; all by way of the tools lawfully available to the executive branch.</p>\n<p>In both cases it is irrelevant whether or not the presidents knew or came to know that actions by their subordinates were illegal. Barr was only advising on the actions the presidents could lawfully take. Further, it is equally clear with the benefit of hindsight that while possibly the product of poor judgment or bad intelligence that both presidents believed that any illegal actions were done in defense of America and American interests as they saw them at the time they engaged in them and with the information they had available to them. Barr advised <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-10/attorney-general-william-barr-used-pardons-to-protect-president\">pardons</a>. He also pushed back at congressional efforts to obtain executive material. Both are legitimate use of executive power. Barr&rsquo;s defense of the office preserved the power of the executive branch for future generations that might find themselves similarly situated regardless of party or of politics.</p>\n<p>Presently it would be absurd to suggest that either Attorney General Barr or Special Counsel Mueller are under any illusions as to Russia&rsquo;s capacity for <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/robert-hanssen\">subversion</a> nor have they ever shown any love for Russian influence and espionage operations. To claim that a man with Barr&rsquo;s history is helping coverup Russian subversion of America without any evidence contrary to his history of fighting against Russia is not plausible. The accusations of coverup are partisan in origin and partisan in current application. That&rsquo;s fine but one can completely disagree with the politics or whether the pardon power should be modified with a constitutional amendment without attributing nefarious intent to the attorney who advises the president with regards to the legality of specific courses of action. It might help to flip party affiliation in order to gain a different understanding of what Barr advised Bush and Reagan. We can do that by creating a hypothetical situation connected to real life events.</p>\n<h3><em>Osama Bin Laden &ndash; A Hypothetical</em></h3>\n<p>If we want good and conscientious presidents to have the power to protect the country on short notice, it is necessary to fight for that power in more problematic situations. We&rsquo;ve seen how an attorney fighting for the office advised in controversial situations. Let&rsquo;s see how that might play out in a far less controversial situation.</p>\n<p>On May 1<sup>st</sup>, 2011 President Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/may-1-2011-president-obama-announces-bin-laden-s-death-677792323587\">announced</a> to the world the death of Osama Bin Laden. Were President Obama&rsquo;s actions <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/obama-legal-authorization-osama-bin-laden-raid.html\">legal</a>? More broadly, was the policy of <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/legality-targeted-killing-program-under-international-law\">targeted killing</a> under President Obama&rsquo;s administration legal? My point here is <em>not</em> to reiterate the legal arguments on both sides. If one follows the hyperlinks one can see that not only did President Obama seek legal counsel regarding these operations, but that there was opposition and push-back. Reasonable legal scholars can and did find that President Obama&rsquo;s actions against Osama Bin Laden were illegal in a variety of respects. Should congress have tasked a special prosecutor to investigate?</p>\n<p>The Republican controlled congress could easily have appointed a special counsel to dog the remainder of President Obama&rsquo;s first term and even recommended impeachment but investigating the <a href=\"https://www.navy.com/careers/navy-seal\">Navy SEALs</a> and the members of the <a href=\"https://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/special-operations/soar.html\">Night Stalkers</a> for killing America&rsquo;s number one enemy would have been politically suicidal for the GOP. Nonetheless &ndash; in this hypothetically, President Obama not only benefitted from the advice of his own attorneys but could have theoretically benefitted from AG Barr&rsquo;s advice regarding pardons just as President Bush did. Had congress chosen to go after the Navy SEALs, the Night Stalkers, or any of their commanders in an attempt to take down President Obama, no one would have batted an eye if Obama had pardoned them. The ability to act quickly without the benefit of extensive legal analysis is one we should want from any president regardless of party particularly since the Supreme Court does not issue advisory opinions.</p>\n<h3><em>Applying past actions to present circumstances</em></h3>\n<p>With regards to Barr&rsquo;s past it is important to take a step back from current politics as terrible as they may be and look at the broader implications. It&rsquo;s helpful to adopt both a long view and a birds eye view of the office of the Attorney General, the office of the president. We should also keep in mind that attorneys have an ethical duty to <a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/model_rules_of_professional_conduct_preamble_scope/\">zealously</a> represent those offices in defense of the Constitution. From this view it&rsquo;s clear that whether one agrees with Barr&rsquo;s expansive view of executive power that it is both arguably justified in key moments of our national history and that his position fully comports with the rule of law as made explicit by the US Constitution. If one is looking to call Barr a bad actor based on his role as an attorney defending the office of the president in times of national crisis one will not find a solid basis to do so. It is important to understand that Barr knew of the perils he faced as well.</p>\n<h2><strong>Additional Criticism</strong></h2>\n<h3><em>Barr&rsquo;s unsolicited letter regarding obstruction</em></h3>\n<p>On June 8, 2018, Barr, then in private practice drafted a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/396090342/June-2018-Barr-Memo-to-DOJ-Muellers-Obstruction-Theory-1\">memorandum</a> analyzing Federal Law governing obstruction of justice focusing on the specific issue of whether a sitting president engaged in lawful activity can be prosecuted by the executive branch for obstructing justice. He concluded that a president could not. He examines two specific acts by the president alleged at the time in the media to be the basis for potential obstruction charges: President Trump&rsquo;s firing of Director Comey, and his public comments with regards to General Flynn&rsquo;s innocence or leniency that the president felt should be applied.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into the minutiae of his argument here. The basic gist of Barr&rsquo;s argument is that the Constitution grants the president plenary power over law enforcement. It is a duty the president cannot recuse from without abandoning the branch altogether. Barr does not argue that a president can engage in illegal acts such as witness tampering with the intent of exonerating himself from crimes, he argues that presidents can engage in facially lawful acts with regards to law enforcement issues that touch their personal conduct because they have ultimate discretion over how to proceed with executive branch law enforcement. If a president is charged with an underlying crime, federal obstruction charges are a &ldquo;side-show&rdquo;. If he is not charged with the underlying crime, neither the plain reading of the obstruction statute in question, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512\">18 U.S.C. &sect;1512</a>, the legislative history, its application, nor DOJ policy suggests that the mere intent behind facially lawful activity such as firing Directory Comey or commenting on Gen. Flynn&rsquo;s case is sufficient to fall within the purview of the statue. Barr&rsquo;s memorandum is limited to a very small subset of acts where the executive engages in Constitutionally lawful acts absent an underlying crime and as a result cannot be charged with obstruction. But that does not place the president above the law. He may still be impeached. He may still be charged with the underlying crimes. He may still be voted out.</p>\n<p>The weakness in Barr&rsquo;s argument is evident when one asks: how can underlying crimes can be investigated if the president can lawfully pardon targets, call for lenient sentences, or fire the chief investigator. The answer again goes back congress. Congress has the power to investigate and punish the president. This is an extremely conservative view. It is the subject of debate amongst legal scholars, but it is not far outside the mainstream nor does it lack foundation in reason or constitutional jurisprudence. In short, one hopes that maintaining a conservative or legal view of constitutional jurisprudence is not grounds for attacking one&rsquo;s character.</p>\n<p>Barr&rsquo;s memorandum has been characterized as an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/04/01/we-cant-trust-william-barr-decide-how-much-muellers-findings-we-see/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.1a0a6b2e2583\">audition</a> of sorts to regain his role as Attorney General in a last ditch attempt to cling to power. It has been <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\">criticized</a> as a baseless argument along the path of placing President Trump above the law. It has been used to justify claims that the Attorney General is actually the <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/03/26/cover-up-attorney-general-bill-barr-strikes-again_partner/\">Coverup-General</a>, a term first <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/19/opinion/essay-the-patsy-prosecutor.html\">used</a> against him by New York Times journalist William Safire in the New York Times decades ago. The fact that Barr chose to draft that memorandum was the subject of intense questioning by <a href=\"http://Senator%20grills%20barr%20over%20memorandum\">Senate Democrats </a>during his confirmation hearing. Yet all of these criticisms demonstrate is that he has an extremely conservative view of the Constitution, legitimate grounds for debate but nothing suggests he&rsquo;s a bad actor. Barr expressly states that his analysis is limited solely to obstruction based on legal action by a president using his plenary authority over law enforcement where no underlying crime is charged. Moreover he states early on in his memorandum that obstruction charges related to Nixon were proper.</p>\n<h3><em>Senator Harris &ndash; A hypothetical</em></h3>\n<p>One of Barr&rsquo;s main concern expressed in this memorandum was that it could create a situation where any lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion could become the subject of criminal prosecution. Let&rsquo;s look at another hypothetical created out of a real world situation. On April 8, 2019 CNN ran a story about a situation where Senator Kamala Harris, acting as a California district attorney and declined to seek the death penalty against a man who killed a San Francisco police officer. The CNN report was criticized almost immediately as a hit piece. How might this play out under the broad view of obstruction that Attorney General Barr argued against in his memorandum?</p>\n<p>For purposes of this exercise I change Harris&rsquo; position from state district attorney to a federal US attorney. We&rsquo;ll leave the rest of the facts the same. According to the linked CNN report, Harris exercise of her discretion was attacked by no less than United States Senator Feinstein at the time who opined that the case fell within the law regarding the death penalty and that it should be pursued. Harris&rsquo; intent was criticized as at best being weak with innuendo about corrupt intent based on political motivations. Under the broad reading of obstruction, she could have been the subject of a criminal investigation based on her intent without any proof of an underlying crime &ndash; one could in effect simply make a criminal accusation, and even if the accusation was groundless a prosecutor could still be prosecuted for exercising her discretion. But this, as Barr rightly argues is untenable. It would essentially destroy prosecutorial discretion.</p>\n<h3><em>Flipping the script in the memorandum</em></h3>\n<p>Barr&rsquo;s memorandum, read in the proper light, is meant to both separate and protect the Department of Justice from politics and to protect executive power from diminution. In addition, I read it as a way to protect Mueller&rsquo;s investigation from having any potential charges overturned by the courts. Barr&rsquo;s memorandum is basically what any high level criminal defense attorney would argue were the president to be charged with obstruction. The fact that it is a legally sound argument founded in conservative jurisprudence means that it is likely to appeal to five of the nine Supreme Court justices. The worst case scenario is not that Barr cleared the president, it&rsquo;s if the Supreme Court does.</p>\n<p>There is scant evidence that he <em>and</em> Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-make-bill-barrs-letter\">relied</a> on this memorandum to justify their conclusion regarding the fact that both men found insufficient evidence to prosecute President Trump for obstructing justice with regards to a potential conspiracy on the part of members of his campaign to work with the Russian Government to hack and disseminate Democratic e-mail and personal information. One can however infer that at least Barr had his arguments in mind when he made his decision. His memorandum refers to corrupt intent. Yet even if he did consciously or unconsciously rely on his arguments, his memorandum is the exact opposite of bad action on Barr&rsquo;s part. I will analyze Barr and Rosenstein&rsquo;s conclusion further in two places below first in regards to Barr&rsquo;s summary letter directly, second in regards to its context the broader ongoing investigations.</p>\n<h3><em>Conclusion regarding Barr&rsquo;s take on obstruction in practice</em></h3>\n<p>On a final note, in <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?459560-1/attorney-general-barr-expects-release-mueller-report-week\">testimony</a> before congress Barr was clear that information regarding obstruction would not redacted from the release of Mueller&rsquo;s report. The public will be able to read the underlying evidence. Barr is not trying to coverup anything. He&rsquo;s not obstructing anything with regards to his analysis. No doubt there will be criticism over his decision, but such criticism will be with regards to his and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein&rsquo;s judgment, not with regards to any nefarious intent. If his judgment is wrong, congress will have all the evidence that they need to impeach the president.</p>\n<h3><em>The psychological need for speed</em></h3>\n<p>Another of the key issues driving concern over the release of the report is the perceived or real damage that the president is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/01/23/two-years-trump-has-been-undermining-american-democracy-heres-damage-report/?utm_term=.d2b16f2e6b1b\">doing</a> to our norms, laws, and international relationships. Many in the president&rsquo;s cabinet are under <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/trump-administration-conflicts/\">investigation</a> for various acts of corruption. Some positions are <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/11/politics/temps-and-vacancies/index.html\">not filled</a> by Senate confirmed leaders and the administration has shown no interest in solving these issues in a timely manner that respects the rule of law and strengthens our relationships with our allies. Moreover, he may be <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/\">financially beholden</a> to hostile foreign countries and pose a grave threat to American national security. The only way to right all of these wrongs is to impeach the president. For two years from 2016 to 2018 the Republican controlled congress appears to have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/387675-house-dems-accuse-gop-of-myriad-oversight-failures-on-trump\">side-stepped</a> their oversight duties. I assumed that during this period that Mueller was taking up the slack left by congress. I assume still that bad information contained in Mueller&rsquo;s report will change the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/us/politics/donald-trump-mueller-report.html\">political landscape</a> and make it easier to impeach the president or at the very least to <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/congress-should-limit-emergency-powers-all-presidents\">craft laws</a> protecting against bad acts by those who may hold the office in the future. As a result of these assumptions I feel as though any delay in obtaining information in the report is a delay inviting further attacks on our national security and preventing congress from protecting against future abuse. I know I&rsquo;m not alone in these emotions. Indeed some fear Barr&rsquo;s summary is part of an overarching goal on the right to turn America into an <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/trump-william-barr-memo-mueller-obstruction-justice.html\">autocracy</a>.</p>\n<p>The president and his camp put further psychological stress on those attempting to understand Barr&rsquo;s actions. The claims of exoneration and the expression of a vindictive desire to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/26/mueller-report-trump-allies-offense-against-democrats-media/3268972002/\">attack</a> Democrats and journalists who covered any aspect of Mueller&rsquo;s investigation were unnerving and disheartening. But does anyone believe Trump would not have claimed vindication under any circumstances or that he would have foregone attacking the press? He <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\">attacked</a> Mueller&rsquo;s investigation hundreds of times on Twitter alone. Barr&rsquo;s memo didn&rsquo;t cause the situation. In fact it deflected Trump&rsquo;s attacks from the actual Mueller report for a time. Barr became the target for the left and the source of unfounded optimism from the presidents camp.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, if one don&rsquo;t feel this urgency to halt at least some of President Trump&rsquo;s abuses it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;re either tuned out of politics or one unquestioningly supports the president. Those emotions are legitimate, real and in some cases <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/donald-trump-devastating-mental-health-policies-rhetoric\">devastating</a>. In terms of politics the frustration may well cause voters to drop out <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/opinion/putin-russia-security-services.html\">political participation</a> all together. However, are these emotions sufficient grounds for attacking Barr for not releasing Mueller&rsquo;s report immediately?</p>\n<p>Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is on record <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/03/11/feature/nancy-pelosi-on-impeaching-president-trump-hes-just-not-worth-it/?utm_term=.1b1397b1add8\">opposing impeachment</a>. Her stated reasoning is that impeachment is incredibly divisive and we need to start to depolarize, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just not worth it&rdquo;, she says. She <a href=\"https://www.today.com/news/nancy-pelosi-says-she-won-t-rule-out-indictment-impeachment-t146197\">hedges</a> her position by claiming that if &ndash; if something terrible comes out in the Barr memo congress will revisit this issue. It&rsquo;s unclear what she would consider impeachable if violations of the Constitution&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-emoluments-clause/2018/11/07/aeb78d72-e26d-11e8-ba30-a7ded04d8fac_story.html?utm_term=.914210fc0bde\">emoluments clause</a> or abuse of the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-whistleblower-says-trump-administration-overturned-25-security-clearance-n989511\">security clearance</a> process or the president&rsquo;s own <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/election-us-2016-37892513/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-guilty-over-emails\">stated grounds</a> for locking someone up &ndash; use of non-secure <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/ivanka-and-jareds-private-email-account-leads-world-hurt-681598\">e-mail</a> which was used by his daughter and son-in-law while in the White House are insufficient. In one sense she&rsquo;s right. If the Senate will not convict, the cost benefit analysis weights against impeachment, divisive polarization and the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/16/trump-impeachment-reelection-midterms-778968\">potential</a> that it will result in unnecessary Democratic losses in the 2020 election are huge costs.</p>\n<p>There are counter-arguments. The one I find <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djrothkopf/status/1111405345031675908\">most persuasive</a> does not rely on the Senate. It&rsquo;s irrelevant whether the Senate will convict or I&rsquo;d add what comes out of the Mueller report. The House has a duty to follow the law. Impeachment in the House even without conviction in the Senate would a strong message to future presidents that Trump&rsquo;s level of incompetence and corruption will not be tolerated. It would negatively set him apart in history from all but a couple of past presidents. And it would shows strength on behalf of the House Democratic majority against corruption and for the rule of law. However none of this relates to Barr&rsquo;s timing on the release of Mueller&rsquo;s report for two reasons.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To delay justice is.injustice,&rdquo; writes William <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/somefruitssolit00penngoog#page/n92/mode/1up\">Penn</a>. However, as argued above there are already <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-impeach-trump-five-reasons-democrats-might-1112-20181109-story.html\">grounds to impeach</a> President Trump in addition to the emoluments clauses and the presidents abuse of power particularly with regards to the security clearance process. Clear evidence in the public record that he abused his power to curtail the investigation into his own campaign is just one more reason to impeach him. While Mueller&rsquo;s report may provide additional grounds or evidence, the Democratically controlled House has what it needs to impeach the president and has chosen not to act. So far there is no reason to believe that reticence in the House will <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2019/03/26/trumps-popularity-unchanged-after-completion-of-mueller-probe/\">change</a>. Therefore, the only ones delaying justice are members of the US House of Representatives based on political calculations, and Senate Republicans for the same reason but geared towards a different outcome. As such, impeachment would at best be a symbolic and precedent setting act by the House which is important but which does not require speed nor does it satisfy the desire for justice.</p>\n<p>Finally, Barr <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?459560-1/attorney-general-barr-expects-release-mueller-report-week\">testified</a> that the Special Counsel <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/part-600\">regulation</a> written during the Clinton administration in the wake of the unnecessary publication of vast amounts of personal, private, and embarrassing information in the Star Report was an attempt to protect the privacy of those in future Special Counsel reports. He noted that while the regulation does not require him to provide the full report, in his discretion he decided that it was important to have the full report minus redactions. He further stated that the report would be ready within a week. There will be disputes based on the redactions. That is to be expected. Nonetheless, the fact that he will release a several hundred page report within a month of receipt substantially undermining any argument that he is engaged in a stalling tactic aimed to obstruct congressional oversight of the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>A desire for speed while apparently close to universally felt in virtually all of the political anti-trump groups is not a legal or even a political necessity. It&rsquo;s arguably a moral necessity, and it&rsquo;s absolutely a personal and psychological necessity for some of us. But while the emotional concern and moral obligations are real and legitimate and the concern over what the president is doing to our norms and relationships and the rule-of-law border on being a duties in themselves they doesn&rsquo;t translate into solid legal or political arguments against Barr&rsquo;s tactics nor do they impugn his character.</p>\n<h3><strong>Barr&rsquo;s Summary &ndash; <em>Who</em> in the World is He Writing About?</strong></h3>\n<p>Many writers have parsed Barr&rsquo;s summary. I want to focus on one very specific area: who he included and who he excluded in his references. After explaining the overarching logistics of the investigation Barr separates his own summary into three parts. First, Barr provides a brief overview of the report. He explains that Mueller&rsquo;s report had two main parts: a sections regarding Russian election interference <em>via</em> propaganda, and a section that regarding Russian hacking computers and disseminating e-mails from Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign, the Democratic party and affiliates. Barr ends this initial paragraph with a quote from Mueller&rsquo;s report, &ldquo;The investigation did not establish that <em>members of the Trump campaign</em> conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.&rdquo; [emphasis added]. Pay attention to those words because Barr alters them in three different ways in his summary. Mueller confines his pronouncement to &ldquo;members of Trump&rsquo;s campaign&rdquo; yet even in this initial paragraph Barr adds &ldquo;or associates&rdquo; to his own take. Finally Barr adds a third section regarding obstruction of justice to his own summary. The obstruction material according to Barr is found in the second section of Mueller&rsquo;s report.</p>\n<h3><em>US persons who were duped into helping the IRA </em></h3>\n<p>Barr paraphrased Mueller&rsquo;s report regarding alleged coordination with members of the Russian organization known as the Internet Research Agency (IRA) whose primary purpose was to disseminate propaganda aimed to sow discord amongst US citizens. He paraphrases Mueller&rsquo;s report to say that it did not &ldquo;<em>any US person</em> or <em>Trump campaign official</em>, or <em>associate</em> conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts&hellip;&rdquo; [emphasis added] Why add the words &ldquo;US persons&rdquo; and the legal term of art &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;? Those words have specific statutory <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/6010\">meaning</a> referring to both US citizens as well as foreign individuals legally residing in the United States. It seems likely that he means to reference at least in part unsuspecting social media users who participated in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/all-social-apps-russian-trolls-used-spread-disinformation-2018-12\">disseminating</a> IRA propaganda or who helped the IRA organize real world <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/russians-organized-pro-anti-trump-rallies-to-sow-discord-2018-2\">protests</a> but that is not entirely clear from the context. Next notice that Barr modifies the word &ldquo;members&rdquo; to &ldquo;official, or associate&rdquo; again further limiting Mueller&rsquo;s words to exclude those outside Mr. Trump&rsquo;s campaign. Were Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Roger Stone, or Michael Cohen &ldquo;official[s] or associate[s]&rdquo; after they left the campaign? Finally, notice he limits the conspiracy and coordination to those directly with the IRA. He mentions Wikileaks in a subsequent paragraph &ndash; why not here? Was there knowing coordination non-campaign officials or associates such as Paul Manafort sharing <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-would-paul-manafort-share-polling-data-with-russia\">internal polling data</a> with non-IRA Konstantin Kilimnick?</p>\n<h3><em>US persons who knowingly worked with Guccifer 2.0 to disseminate hacked e-mail </em></h3>\n<p>Next, Barr turns to Russian military hacking. He uses interesting language here. He describes those who had their computers hacked as &ldquo;persons affiliated with the Clinton Campaign and the Democratic Party organizations.&rdquo; Why didn&rsquo;t he use &ldquo;officials&rdquo; or &ldquo;associates&rdquo;? Barr&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;affiliated with&rdquo; here suggest he meant to be very specific when referring to potential targets of the investigation from Trump&rsquo;s team. He also states that the e-mails were disseminated through &ldquo;<em>various</em> intermediaries, including Wikileaks.&rdquo; [Emphasis added]. A number of <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/10/09/exclusive-new-email-leak-reveals-clinton-campaigns-cozy-press-relationship/\">writers</a> and <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2016/10/04/guccifer-2-0-claims-to-have-hacked-clinton-foundation/\">publications</a> were in direct or indirect contact with Guccifer 2.0 and disseminated <a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-08-12/russian-hacker-guccifer-20-publishes-complete-personal-information-200-congressional\">information</a> and analysis of hacked material.</p>\n<p>Barr acknowledges that Russia uses intermediaries but then limits his conclusion, &ldquo;the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian Government in these efforts despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.&rdquo; First, notice Barr adds &ldquo;or anyone associated with it&rdquo; to Mueller&rsquo;s quote. Next he does not include the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; as a modifier for coordinated as he did in his paragraph on propaganda. Third, Barr uses the word &ldquo;affiliated&rdquo; as with Clinton above suggesting by affiliated he intends to refer to both officials and intermediaries. But it&rsquo;s striking and strange that he says that the campaign had offers from the <em>affiliates</em> but didn&rsquo;t coordinate with the <em>government</em>. Did Mueller find coordination between the targets and the affiliates? Fourth, he does not include &ldquo;US persons&rdquo; as he did in the propaganda section. Those US persons who interacted with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi7p6e4kbrhAhXvY98KHUpDDj8QFjACegQIABAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.lawfareblog.com%252Frussia-indictment-20-what-make-muellers-hacking-indictment&usg=AOvVaw0uBKLgRoyJi3Q7KiFcXdBw\">Guccifer 2.0</a> and disseminated hacked e-mails provided to them by the Russian government should contact their lawyers. Finally, how does Barr or Mueller understand the term campaign? As above do past members such as Roger Stone or Carter Page count? Were they still affiliated? What about George Papadopoulos? Are acts of campaign officials limited to the time they were part of the campaign and before?</p>\n<h3><em>Obstruction under severely limited circumstances </em></h3>\n<p>Barr&rsquo;s third section on obstruction of justice is three paragraphs &ndash; more space than his entire overview and breakdown of the report and conclusions. In the opening paragraph he provides a summary of an outline of the report. He states that the Special Prosecutor looked at a variety of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s actions in an attempt to determine whether they constituted obstruction of justice. &ldquo;Most&hellip;have been the subject of public reporting.&rdquo; He notes that Mueller addressed the obstruction issue in the second section of his report and that he did not, &ldquo;draw a conclusion &ndash; one way or the other &ndash; as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction.&rdquo; He continues, &ldquo;Instead, for <em>each of the relevant actions investigated</em>, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as &ldquo;difficult issues&rdquo; of law and fact concerning whether the president&rsquo;s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction&rdquo; [Emphasis added]. Finally, he quotes the Special Counsel, &ldquo;&rdquo;while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.&rdquo; How many actions were taken by the president? What has not been the subject of public reporting? Why didn&rsquo;t Mueller draw conclusions? Why did then conclude that the evidence does not exonerate Trump? What other crimes, if any, did Mueller find evidence of obstruction?</p>\n<p>Barr&rsquo;s second and third paragraphs explains that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein drew their own conclusion &ndash; that evidence was insufficient to establish that Trump obstructed justice. He writes that his conclusion was not based on his memorandum discussed above. Rather, he again quotes the Special Counsel, &ldquo;the evidence does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,&rdquo; Barr explains the elements of the crime: acting with corrupt intent, obstructive conduct, and a nexus to pending or contemplated proceedings. Barr does not discuss the evidence. He merely states they did not find all three elements could be proved &ldquo;beyond a reasonable doubt&rdquo;. In addition, Barr&rsquo;s quote is limited solely to election interference. Finally, it seems from the quote attributed to Mueller that he&rsquo;s grounding his determination on corrupt intent. If so, it&rsquo;s hard to see how he did not at least have some of the arguments from his memorandum in mind guiding his conclusion. On that issue we are left to speculate for now. Nonetheless, until we have a more complete picture of the full report there is no basis to draw any conclusion with regard to Barr&rsquo;s intent. The only position he personally takes in this memorandum is consistent with his defense of executive power and inconsistent with corruption.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Summary Reception of Barr&rsquo;s Summary Letter</strong></h3>\n<p>Almost immediately upon release of the letter a number of <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/153384/yes-trump-obstructed-justice-william-barr-helping-cover-up\">writers</a> derided Barr as a the president&rsquo;s man installed to do Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/mueller-report-barr-summary-obstruction-conspiracy-close-reading.html\">bidding</a>. Though some of those arguments have a rational basis which I will discuss below, I don&rsquo;t find any particularly compelling as to Barr&rsquo;s intent or character. Barr has limited ability to assist in a coverup and little incentive to do so beyond his conservativetake on obstruction of justice as it applies to the presidency and an out of the main stream belief in <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/william-barr-troubling-view-presidential-power\">executive</a> power.</p>\n<h3><em>Barr&rsquo;s notification letter: disempowering Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed</em></h3>\n<p>Stepping back a few days Barr&rsquo;s summary is framed by his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/doj-notification-to-congress-regarding-the-conclusion-of-the-mueller-investigation/?utm_term=.e68a1cb97500\">notification</a> to congress that he had received the Special Counsel&rsquo;s report. In this notification Barr dismantles the president&rsquo;s attacks on both the Special Counsel and the DOJ. The notification states that there were no instances where the Attorney General or Acting Attorney General found that Mueller&rsquo;s actions were inappropriate or unwarranted. This is both under-reported and extremely important because it means that Mr. Manafort&rsquo;s convictions as well as Lieutenant General Flynn&rsquo;s and Mr. Papadopoulos&rsquo;s pleas and the rest of the pleas and indictments are not the result of what the president and the Russian propagandists at Sputnik called an out of control &ldquo;witch hunt&rdquo; by a gang of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiW7uHtuaDhAhXtw1kKHW9vCjwQFjAHegQIAxAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fsputniknews.com%252Fviral%252F201811271070180032-trump-mueller-rogue-prosecutor%252F&usg=AOvVaw1BCbiyjxRNbA-bUi98dcw5\">angry Democrats</a>&rdquo; nor were any of the ongoing prosecutions that were referred to multiple other DOJ offices. His notification negated the arguments put forth by Manafort&rsquo;s team that Mueller acted outside of his <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjlwpGpuqDhAhWwzlkKHeP8De8QFjACegQIAhAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.politico.com%252Fstory%252F2018%252F05%252F15%252Fmanafort-mueller-indictment-590215&usg=AOvVaw1k8RMqcRJfvFJDQzEadWn7\">authority</a>. It vindicates that judges who arrived at the same conclusion.</p>\n<h3><em>Returning to Barr&rsquo;s summary letter</em></h3>\n<p>As noted above there are still <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwipnraWvKDhAhXBrVkKHRHlCzwQFjAAegQIBRAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.wired.com%252Fstory%252Fmueller-investigation-trump-russia-complete-guide%252F&usg=AOvVaw0D9rAA6X34fcDDYbcn1_cw\">multiple</a> ongoing DOJ, and state investigations. Nothing in Barr&rsquo;s letter rules out the possibility that the evidence the Special Counsel&rsquo;s Office (SCO) uncovered with regards to election interference and hacking may by bolstered by ongoing work from other DOJ offices and prosecutors to the extent that it might rise to the level of prosecution at some point. The investigations in many cases always involved <a href=\"https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1109797383460798469\">multiple offices</a>. His letter was limited to Mueller&rsquo;s report and really to an extremely limited read of that report. But who was he writing his report for?</p>\n<p>My analysis in the following paragraph is purely speculative. Public outcry and congressional pressure were easily foreseeable to anyone and particularly to someone with Barr&rsquo;s long political history and the decades of attacks on his character. It seems equally clear that while those effects understood that the general public and congressional Democrats were not his primary audience. His primary audience, the one who reacted positively to the letter and the underlying report &ndash; at least initially was President Trump. It is likely given the circumstances that Barr sought to placate a deeply insecure and nervous president. Barr knows better than most that the president holds the nuclear codes. He knows that Trump has the power to cause all manner of chaos. To the extent the letter kept the lid on the pressure cooker by placating Trump it did a service &ndash; it bought time for other investigations while maintaining stability. The worst outcome is something which Trump does anyway &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=11&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiLlY6zvKDhAhXSt1kKHepICo4QFjAKegQIAhAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.cnn.com%252F2019%252F03%252F25%252Fpolitics%252Fdonald-trump-mueller-campaign-trail%252Findex.html&usg=AOvVaw2dxbve9kI9YZ6GREgZejXY\">attack</a> both the Democrats and the media. There are other positive aspects of Barr&rsquo;s letter too.</p>\n<h2><em>Barr&rsquo;s Letter &ndash; the Upshot</em></h2>\n<p>The upshot of Barr&rsquo;s willingness to take the heat for his letter and the president&rsquo;s belief in his own vindication is that it leaves the DOJ, FBI, and state law enforcement professionals to continue their work well out of the limelight and media spectacle surrounding the 2016 election investigation. Barr&rsquo;s letter also resulted in Trump going on record at least initially to say that the Mueller report should be <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=23&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj2sMfalbrhAhWineAKHSaVDYoQFjAWegQIAhAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.wsj.com%252Farticles%252Ftrump-more-than-happy-for-release-of-full-mueller-report-white-house-says-11553520972&usg=AOvVaw0Q3crDZILy6f92MK4qoyaN\">released</a>. He later <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=22&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj2sMfalbrhAhWineAKHSaVDYoQFjAVegQIARAB&url=http%253A%252F%252Fnymag.com%252Fintelligencer%252F2019%252F04%252Ftrump-no-longer-enthusiastic-about-releasing-mueller-report.html&usg=AOvVaw0HDhWxgE9K9mT9mLsAsBgR\">walked</a> that back but that act in itself was politically bad for Trump and his attempts to put the Mueller genie back in the bottle undoubtedly left more of a paper trail. Finally, stalling is of no political benefit to Trump who desires nothing more than to put the entire investigation behind him. In taking time to do proper reductions, ask the proper questions, provide the best information to congress and the American people while still assuring folks that they will obtain the necessary, Barr&rsquo;s letter and his subsequent updates and responses to questions keeps information about ongoing investigations away from those in congress such as <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=22&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj2sMfalbrhAhWineAKHSaVDYoQFjAVegQIARAB&url=http%253A%252F%252Fnymag.com%252Fintelligencer%252F2019%252F04%252Ftrump-no-longer-enthusiastic-about-releasing-mueller-report.html&usg=AOvVaw0HDhWxgE9K9mT9mLsAsBgR\">Devin Nunes</a> who themselves may be the subject of ongoing DOJ investigations.</p>\n<h3><em>Barr&rsquo;s Experience Matters</em></h3>\n<p>Barr is far from being inexperienced <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/03/24/706206090/who-is-attorney-general-william-barr\">prosecutor</a>. He was Mueller&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjJ8Orb_qLhAhWCct8KHTd9DVoQFjACegQIABAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F1995%252F05%252F28%252Fus%252Fman-in-the-background-at-the-fbi-now-draws-some-unwelcome-attention.html&usg=AOvVaw3Z5PkiL1S-7pzCTn7_pc6J\">boss</a> at one point. He knows directly and experientially that lawyers and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi00e6a_6LhAhVshuAKHY3yDHsQFjAAegQIAxAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F1992%252F11%252F12%252Fopinion%252Fessay-1st-global-political-scandal.html&usg=AOvVaw1oLHNfP_edURcLK4d1rfIJ\">journalists</a> will parse every word he writes and that his words can have enormous political consequences. He knows that his own actions and communications with Trump might be investigated and perhaps even construed as a part of an attempt to <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1993/01/motherjones-jf93-shredded-justice/\">obstruct justice</a>. However, there are some important facts to keep in mind. Barr in now sixty-eight years old. While he may have taken some risk in the past with regards to his reputation and provided some legal advice that allowed for attacks on his character little in Barr&rsquo;s lengthy work history suggests he is the type to gamble his reputation and legacy at this point for an incompetent president who at the end of the day may prove to be little more than a low rent Mafioso. Even in his confirmation hearing he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/04/william-barr-justice-department-226570\">stated</a> that, &ldquo;I feel I&rsquo;m in a position in life where I can do the right thing and not really care about the consequences,&rdquo; Others writers are less optimistic.</p>\n<h3><em>Reading Will Saletan&rsquo;s read</em></h3>\n<p>Will Saletan <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/mueller-report-barr-summary-obstruction-conspiracy-close-reading.html\">reads</a> Barr&rsquo;s summary as a defense for Mr. Trump by his handpicked Attorney General. Underlying Saletan&rsquo;s opinion about Barr&rsquo;s motives lie questions that run parallel to some of my own. Why did Mr. Barr choose to quote Mueller limiting his conclusions to a those involving a conspiracy with the Russian government or the IRA and not &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/03/russia-probes-kremlin-deniability-244492\">cut outs</a>&rdquo; or those used as intermediaries by the Russian government. One primary purpose for using intermediaries is to shield both the Russian Government and their sources from these types of charges.</p>\n<p>Saletan focuses on the way Barr limited his letter to &ldquo;election interference activities&rdquo;. He points out, as does Tom Nichols that not all of the president&rsquo;s attempts to work with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiX0Z7HvaDhAhUCy1kKHeq1AsYQFjAAegQIAhAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.usatoday.com%252Fstory%252Fopinion%252F2019%252F03%252F25%252Ftrump-russia-questions-unanswered-after-mueller-report-barr-letter-column%252F3264104002%252F&usg=AOvVaw3zeI5M4J_KRlPz8tNqoqT_\">Moscow</a> were elections related. Is Mueller&rsquo;s report limited to elections interference? No, we&rsquo;ve linked evidence of ongoing investigation that originated in Mueller&rsquo;s investigation above. At the very least he would have explained why he transferred cases to other DOJ offices as part of the requirements of the report. Mueller was tasked to conduct a counter-intelligence investigation as well. Does his report have a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwivj5f-vaDhAhUxo1kKHS5WB5gQ0PADMAB6BAgAEAU&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.theatlantic.com%252Fpolitics%252Farchive%252F2019%252F03%252Fbarrs-summary-omits-key-aspect-muellers-report%252F585703%252F&usg=AOvVaw0q4rS_2LB4Dz4tsGfmZojc\">counter-intelligence</a> aspect. If so, we know nothing of what Mueller concluded. Why did Barr limit his conclusions to these two areas knowing that limiting his letter in this manner would all but necessitate congressional hearings? The intent to engage congress seems even more plausible in light of the fact that Barr believes congress is the proper body to investigate the president. Yet if that&rsquo;s the case it that suggests good intent with regards to the Attorney General.</p>\n<p>Saletan has additional arguments including an entire section on the odd issue of Barr&rsquo;s decision to decline further pursuit of Trump&rsquo;s alleged obstruction of justice. Barr was certainly aware his decision not to move forward with obstruction of justice charges would be called into question because he took pains to explain that he was not basing his decision on that memo in his summary letter. Further, he was grilled on this during his confirmation <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjM_u3Jv6DhAhWJ1lkKHTHFArsQFjAEegQIBBAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.usatoday.com%252Fstory%252Fnews%252Fpolitics%252F2019%252F03%252F25%252Fdemocrats-question-ag-william-barr-position-obstruction-justice%252F3264298002%252F&usg=AOvVaw0rdHoaCAfKhDK3T0BowIQy\">hearings</a>. He knew that by including this issue in his letter his decision would be viewed at best as a form of legal confirmation bias and at worst part of Trump&rsquo;s own attempts to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjS_Nzcv6DhAhXLrFkKHUU2CfQQFjADegQIAhAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fnewrepublic.com%252Farticle%252F153384%252Fyes-trump-obstructed-justice-william-barr-helping-cover-up&usg=AOvVaw2AnAbLoGol0fmu8Z1B3sSL\">coverup</a> alleged criminal activity. Why include a section in the letter on obstruction if not to ensure congress would investigate it?</p>\n<h3><em>Katyal&rsquo;s Critique</em></h3>\n<p>A number of other writers have weighed-in on the obstruction issue attacking Barr&rsquo;s conception of obstruction. Neal Katyal who notably <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/could-trump-remove-special-counsel-robert-mueller-lessons-watergate\">drafted</a> the Special Counsel regulations while an attorney at the DOJ writes the most in-depth <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/24/opinion/barr-mueller-report.html\">criticism</a>. He raises numerous serious questions that hit at the core of Barr&rsquo;s position. Katyal focuses on what he believes to be Barr&rsquo;s conclusion that Mr. Trump&rsquo;s actions did not demonstrate the &ldquo;corrupt intent&rdquo; element of the crime. He questions how could Barr arrive at this conclusion without anyone interviewing Trump? Katyal further explains that it&rsquo;s important to understand why Mueller did not seek to compel an interview. But Katyal&rsquo;s question is itself is grounded in a political and legal assumption regarding the separations of powers. Did Mueller conclude that it would be better for the AG to conduct the interview? Was he leaving it for congress?</p>\n<p>The most serious criticism Katyal levies is to question whether Mr. Barr sought to enshrine the view he expressed in his pre-nomination memo. He writes,</p>\n<p>[Barr&rsquo;s] unsolicited memo should be understood for what it is, a badly argued attempt to put presidents above the law. If he used that legal fiction to let President Trump off the hook, Congress would have to begin an impeachment investigation to vindicate the rule of law.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to step back and examine this from another angle. Barr is aware that if his take on federal obstruction law were to be accepted it would become a precedent that could be used by presidents from any party and that&rsquo;s at the heart of his position. He knows that experientially because he worked for multiple administrations. He knows that logically as well. Yet this argument against Barr misses the mark with regards to any potential corruption on behalf of the Attorney General. It&rsquo;s further evidence for the interpretation of Barr&rsquo;s actions that I&rsquo;ve argued. He&rsquo;s not interested in helping Trump. Barr is defending executive power in general and his own particular view of executive power specifically. At worst one could argue that this position goes against Barr&rsquo;s judgment but there is no basis to use it as evidence against his character or patriotism. That&rsquo;s a key distinction. One can and should question his judgment without attacking his character.</p>\n<p>Moreover, would Barr risk one of his deeply held beliefs with regards to executive power and decades of work on behalf of America simply to exonerate someone against facts uncovered during the investigation? In other words, if the president is indicted and impeached and Barr helped to cover it all up, Barr implodes as an accessory after the fact and so does his life&rsquo;s work. The cost benefit analysis based on existent credible evidence weights heavily against it.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s incomprehensible to assume he hasn&rsquo;t contemplated the consequences of personally exonerating Trump based on his controversial interpretation of a federal statute and constitutional separation of powers or that such actions would remain hidden. Additionally, as someone who served in the CIA and under Presidents Reagan and Bush he must have some concerns that President Trump might be <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/01/13/mounting-evidence-trump-fears-putin-compromising-information-column/2564892002/\">compromised</a> or at least vulnerable to being compromised by Vladimir Putin. He seems willing to act to support his interpretation of obstruction generally and executive power more broadly but nothing in his actions to date suggest treachery and lawlessness. With that in mind let&rsquo;s move from Barr&rsquo;s critics in the anti-Trump camp to an examination of the reaction to Barr&rsquo;s letter from Trump&rsquo;s side.</p>\n<h3><strong>Compromised</strong></h3>\n<p>In the wake of Barr&rsquo;s letter Trump and his allies immediately declared victory. Per their standard operating procedures (SOP) they are aggressively engaged in attacks on reporters and politicians with a zeal that borders on self-parody. Sarah Huckabee Sanders posted a <a href=\"https://hillreporter.com/sarah-sanders-tweets-out-disturbing-march-madness-style-bracket-28683\">march madness</a> style bracket list of journalists who as David Frum <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/1110381322864738304\">points</a> out were far more accurate than the President himself with regards to his own and his campaign&rsquo;s connections with various Russians. In short, the Trump camp is irrationally ecstatic with Barr. Trump even <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiixqDSwaDhAhVCvFkKHZl2Ci8Q0PADMAB6BAgEEAU&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.voanews.com%252Fa%252Ftrump-praises-mueller-as-democrats-fume%252F4847723.html&usg=AOvVaw19hGrAUrDesO4IYI_sgA_n\">praised</a> Mueller after his letter. As mentioned briefly above, despite the usual Trumpian autocratic cosplay, it looks at this point like Barr accomplished one thing. He maintained a modicum of stability in the executive branch. Trump might be going full authoritarian performance art mode but so far he&rsquo;s not starting a war with North Korea to distract from Mueller&rsquo;s report at this point. Barr gave Trump his confidence back.</p>\n<p>Now we need to ask: Did Barr give the president false confidence? As a matter of public record we know there were many <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-russia-government-contact-timeline-2018-7\">contacts</a> between the Trump campaign and Russia. We know there were offers for to assist from intermediaries of the Russian government forwarding <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-crown-prosecutor-of-russia-donald-trump-jr-emails-2017-7\">offers</a> from the Russian government. We know that those offers were at least tacitly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b71f2eYdTc\">accepted</a>. We know there was offer to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/us/politics/michael-flynn-russia-sanctions-ripped-up-whistleblower.html\">lift sanctions</a> prior to inauguration. What we don&rsquo;t know is whether members of Trump&rsquo;s team had the requisite knowledge that the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjWnp-qw6DhAhWHylkKHQz-DyAQFjABegQIARAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F2019%252F01%252F08%252Fnyregion%252Ftrump-tower-natalya-veselnitskaya-indictment.html&usg=AOvVaw0ojr-o3qfdcxH3rEGo5JIS\">Russia operatives</a> they were dealing with were intelligence agents, or whether they had the intent required to satisfy that mental element of any potential crime that might fall under the non-legal term &ldquo;collusion&rdquo;. We know Russia relies on the use of intermediaries in part to sow this type of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kasparov63/status/1109957146249187328\">confusion</a>. It&rsquo;s possible that conspiring with cut-outs rather than official foreign government agents is indeed a loophole in US law that needs to be fixed going forward. Former NSA spook John Schindler <a href=\"https://twitter.com/20committee/status/1110159325434204160\">puts</a> it in <em>snark</em> relief: &ldquo;Apparently it&rsquo;s ok to conspire against a US election as long as the guys you&rsquo;re secretly parlaying with aren&rsquo;t wearing &lsquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m GRU&rsquo; t-shirts.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But is it really plausible to say that Trump&rsquo;s family and courtiers didn&rsquo;t know they were dealing with Russian intelligence personnel or <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiqqMG-w6DhAhXpzVkKHZQbBioQFjAEegQIBRAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.cbsnews.com%252Fnews%252Fhow-did-wikileaks-become-associated-with-russia%252F&usg=AOvVaw0ctx2-ranHQT00xIx2bh-e\">cut-outs</a>? There is ample reason to believe this is pretty far-fetched particularly given that Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign put out <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=15&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiHt7T2w6DhAhUirlkKHd8sB0M4ChAWMAR6BAgCEAE&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.latimes.com%252Fnation%252Fpolitics%252Ftrailguide%252Fla-na-trailguide-updates-hillary-clinton-campaign-raises-1469368571-htmlstory.html&usg=AOvVaw1gLS9I8N73peywbFaJom1E\">ads</a> which accurately depicted the connections between Trump, his campaign, and Russia. Indeed Trump&rsquo;s team seemed to know something wasn&rsquo;t right because the candidate and his campaign <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjUjvSSzqDhAhXQl-AKHXueC1MQFjAHegQIAxAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.apnews.com%252Fe26846d6068c4e98a29783bbb451c9e0&usg=AOvVaw1VmMw5EBt0b3X5C235RnYY\">lied</a> about all the contacts &ndash; a lot. Moreover, at the very least, upon receiving security clearances campaign members would have been briefed that foreign nationals might try to gather information and told to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=16&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj6j-acxKDhAhWwt1kKHY99B3wQFjAPegQICBAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fnews.clearancejobs.com%252F2017%252F04%252F19%252Fwhy-security-clearance-holders-are-required-to-report-foreign-contacts%252F&usg=AOvVaw1jqoB12fnoSPpjcWlLrZGm\">report contacts</a>. It&rsquo;s difficult to see why Mueller would not have at least brought this to a Grand Jury to determine probable cause or why if he did it didn&rsquo;t result in indictment. Unless as Louise Mensch reports there are <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2017/10/29/exclusive-mueller-has-dozens-of-sealed-indictments-including-on-donald-trump/\">indictments</a> obtained and sealed outside the purview of the Special Counsel&rsquo;s investigation. I tend to believe that. Most of the public was shocked when George Papadopoulos&rsquo; indictment was <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\">unsealed</a>. He wasn&rsquo;t even on most of our radars. Folks were less shocked when Roger Stone&rsquo;s indictment was <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\">unsealed</a>. So we know Mueller&rsquo;s team had some sealed indictments. Nonetheless, on Mensch&rsquo;s reporting as it relates to the future we&rsquo;ll have to wait for further information to develop to confirm. In the meantime, I want to look at one more possibility as well that may converge in some way or at some point with Mensch&rsquo;s report.</p>\n<h3><em>Three possibilities</em></h3>\n<p>As a preliminary matter lets question two theories floating about the internet. One might conclude that Trump and his enablers are so <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KenDilanianNBC/status/1113806696097505281\">incredibly stupid</a> and incompetent they just went along blindly and clueless with Russian intelligence assets. This seems entirely plausible at least initially and an early spokesperson for Trump&rsquo;s legal team made exactly this argument with an anecdote about Trump and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/27/ex-trump-aide-details-presidents-alleged-effort-cover-up-trump-tower-meeting/?utm_term=.90eac5c2f33d\">Hope Hicks</a>. NBC also <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/barr-didn-t-do-justice-mueller-report-officials-tell-new-n990776\">reported</a> that Mueller&rsquo;s team had an internal dispute regarding this conclusion. However the similarity between the position of those in the Trump camp and the NBC report raises the question of which government officials NBC sourced their story from. Moreover, on reflection given Manafort&rsquo;s, Gates&rsquo;s, and Stone&rsquo;s participation in the campaign, this conclusion does not come across as plausible. That trio knew exactly what they were doing. Like Trump they&rsquo;d been playing this game for <a href=\"https://thehill.com/social-tags/black-manafort-stone-and-kelly\">decades</a>.</p>\n<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, perhaps the Trump camp was comprised of evil geniuses so adept at espionage they were able to hide all evidence of coordination from NSA and FBI counter-intelligence. However, Russian communications were <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/15/515358124/reports-u-s-intercepted-calls-between-trump-campaign-staff-and-russian-intellige\">intercepted</a>. Gen. Mike Flynn, Commanding General of the Defense Intelligence Agency&rsquo;s communications with the Russian embassy was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/2/10/14575456/michael-flynn-phone-call-russia-explained\">intercepted</a>. Navy SEAL Eric Prince was <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/erik-prince-seychelles-meeting_n_5aa0be4ae4b0d4f5b66d566d\">intercepted</a> negotiating with Russians in the Seychelles. Neither Trump nor his campaign members nor Russian intelligence outsmarted the <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/newly-disclosed-nsa-documents-shed-further-light-five-eyes-alliance\">five eyes</a> intelligence community. They were neither too stupid nor too smart to avoid indictment. Trump and members of his campaign were however both experienced and vulnerable.</p>\n<h3><em>The middle path </em></h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;m relying in part on some of Tom <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Nichol</a>&rsquo;s and John <a href=\"https://twitter.com/20committee?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Schindler</a>&rsquo;s writing herethough nothing their including should not be read to indicate their agreement.Given the problems with the two above theories, it seems more likely that campaign personnel were slowly encouraged into going along with Russia&rsquo;s efforts to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiY7-fdmrrhAhUNnOAKHTE-C1YQFjAEegQIAhAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.usatoday.com%252Fstory%252Fnews%252Fpolitics%252F2018%252F05%252F16%252Fsenate-intel-panel-russia-tried-help-trump-hurt-clinton-2016-election%252F615716002%252F&usg=AOvVaw1SFMjoxO0AqW_p6rJ8Hhlv\">damage</a> Hillary Clinton and sow discord by Russian business and intelligence connected &ldquo;friends&rdquo;. Maybe these friends casually made mention of past prior embarrassing financial or criminal activity as a gentle sort of stick. The Russians held a variety of incentives to offer as a carrot too from assistance with the election to a deal for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiJ0qv4mrrhAhWMl-AKHdgSB3sQFjACegQIAhAB&url=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msnbc.com%252Frachel-maddow-show%252Fjustify-trump-tower-moscow-effort-president-redefines-business&usg=AOvVaw1j6IGG9JGjDKjYwXFsqRIv\">Trump Tower Moscow</a>. The Trump family has been working with Russians for a very long <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwid9sqYm7rhAhUCZd8KHU6EDMEQFjAAegQIAhAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.politico.com%252Fmagazine%252Fstory%252F2017%252F11%252F19%252Ftrump-first-moscow-trip-215842&usg=AOvVaw1fZI5CODNn0ew6ppwG9avf\">time</a>. I suspect that Donald Trump Sr., Manafort, Stone, Gates and maybe even some of Trump&rsquo;s children experienced a vague unease about <em>not </em>cooperating and a greed and vanity driven desire to cooperate.</p>\n<p>I believe Mueller could not obtain sufficient evidence to prosecute Trump and his campaign regarding elections hacking and propaganda because instead of entering into a criminal agreement to alter the 2016 election they simply acquiesced to the Kremlin&rsquo;s operation as targets of Russian influence because they already knew the process. I believe the evidence of their interactions with regards to the election will be used in subsequent prosecutions and as noted above it may already have resulted in indictments on other charges.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s team knew their participation could prove embarrassing and possibly criminal if they were caught yet still felt compelled and attacked to going along as a result of vague incentives and coercion. This means that there was no Hollywood style handler issuing orders at a drop site and also not evidence of an agreement or intent. The agreement was set decades ago and resulted in a system that was already in place after decades of work. On a related side-note, the attempt by the world&rsquo;s intelligence communities to avoid having powerful government or related individuals compromised is the reason we have security classification and security clearance <a href=\"https://law.yale.edu/student-life/career-development/students/career-pathways/public-interest/you-apply-understanding-government-background-checks\">background</a> checks and why those checks are updated in real time via <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\">monitoring</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dss.mil/ma/tw/dvd/vroc/reinvestigations/\">periodically</a> by means of investigation. This is why Trump&rsquo;s abuse of that process is so troubling.</p>\n<h3><em>No duress in a legal sense </em></h3>\n<p>I want to be clear. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that the SCO concluded that members of Trump&rsquo;s family and campaign were prohibited from agreeing to coordinate because they were under duress. They weren&rsquo;t forced into an agreement or forced to engage in illegal activity <em>per se. </em>This wasn&rsquo;t a violent mob threat with some enforcer dangling Donald J. Trump Jr. off the top of Trump Tower demanding the president engage in espionage. From an prosecution point of view &ndash; even if it an agreement to work with the Russians had been coerced, a duress defense would be made during plea negotiations or a during a prosecution and it would require the one claiming duress to prove that they were under an imminent threat of physical <a href=\"https://www.justia.com/criminal/defenses/duress/\">harm</a> at the time they coordinated. I mean something very different here.</p>\n<h3><em>Compromised &ndash; a toned down take</em></h3>\n<p>This situation I&rsquo;m describing would be more akin to the use of <a href=\"https://observer.com/2017/03/kremlingate-russia-spy-game-disinformation/\"><em>kompromat</em></a> by Russian intelligence in a manner along the lines of what Tom Nichols <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/10/trump-russia-jonathan-chait-218966\">describes</a> here:</p>\n<p>&hellip; how would such compromising work in practice? &hellip;[some] might be watching too much television. This is not an episode of <em>The Americans</em>. No one issues orders, and anyone looking for such evidence is likely to be disappointed. Rather, over time, as relationships grow, favors are asked. Friendships are pressed into service. The key is to induce the target to do what you want without telling him to do it&mdash;to be a friend, helping out friends.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Chait&rsquo;s article &ndash; criticized in a friendly way by Tom Nichols in the piece I took the above quote from drew this conclusion in a crime thriller sensationalistic type of way last year. I&rsquo;m not joining or attempting to reiterate either of their efforts here nor mimic the work of John Schindler with regards to assessing Russian subversion efforts. Rather, Russian subversion and the business history are helpful to explain why Mueller&rsquo;s team found a vast amount of evidence but also found it difficult to satisfy the mental elements of the crime when the players involved were both experienced and knew at least to an extent what the Russian&rsquo;s were up to in regards to their elections related crimes. Chait&rsquo;s most recent <a href=\"http://nymag.com/article/2019/04/my-article-saying-trump-was-compromised-by-russia-was-right.html\">article</a> revisits his conclusions specifically citing the the Moscow tower deal. But he uses it as a victory lap over his previous report rather than a possible explanation of why the president and his entourage were not charged regarding the elections interference.</p>\n<p>With this possibility in mind it&rsquo;s interesting review in broad strokes the now infamous meeting to see exactly <em>how</em> it&rsquo;s plausibly that Barr or Mueller might conclude that meeting and other meetings and communications like it did not result <em>in itself</em> in an agreement by to coordinate with the Russian government but was instead a continuation of ongoing relationships that also became the foundation of more <em>kompromat</em> going forward.</p>\n<h3><em>Re-imagining the scene at Trump Tower</em></h3>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the scene. Russian business people connected to and members of the Russian government expressing interest in doing business with Trump. They float a Moscow Tower deal, loans, or help with Trump&rsquo;s election. They&rsquo;re interested in cultivating a popular and potentially powerful man. Trump knows the players, he knows what they want, he&rsquo;s deal with them before. These business people through a lawyer who herself is connected to Russian Intelligence arrange a meeting. During this meeting the float various campaign related incentives to Paul Manafort with whom they&rsquo;ve done business with in the past, Donald Trump Jr. who has bragged about the Trump organization doing a large amount of business with Russia, and Jared Kushner who has his own ties personally and via his wife. All three had varying levels of experience.</p>\n<p>The president, his family, and those around him already know how these types of business deals work because Donald Trump Sr. has been working with Russians since at least 1987. They all already know what they need to do. They go along with the hacking a dissemination because it benefits them but they don&rsquo;t know <em>at the time </em>what they&rsquo;ll get out of the deal. The do know that at some point they&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;pressed into service.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t even need to be asked twice even though they were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/26/us/politics/trump-contacts-russians-wikileaks.html\">asked</a> multiple times. They&rsquo;re thrilled for the help.</p>\n<p>As campaign members engage in their part of the vague deal to <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/taking-stock-what-mueller-s-trump-russia-probe-revealed/507725692/\">damage</a> Hillary Clinton and divide America they are providing their Russian counterparts with even more compromising information against themselves. And, they do in fact believe this information might implicate them in criminal activity or at the least be deeply embarrassing, politically damaging, and potentially delegitimizing with regards to the results of the elections. Maybe the threats are never spoken &ndash; but Trump and his family know that they exists and they know what they need to do to stay on Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s good side.</p>\n<p>In a situation like the one described above there would be no criminal conspiracy to coordinate with the Russian Government or their cut-outs to throw the 2016 election and no basis to prosecute despite strong evidence for various elements of the crime. The agreement, direction, and specifics of the quid pro quo would be missing. Sure there was a meeting. Sure there were e-mails released. Trump&rsquo;s campaign may have even had access to them before dissemination. Recall how Trump <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjhvtnYkKPhAhWvSt8KHRwqC6YQFjABegQIBBAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.washingtonpost.com%252Fnews%252Fthe-fix%252Fwp%252F2016%252F10%252F31%252Fhacked-emails-suggest-trump-was-right-after-all-clinton-got-previews-of-some-debate-questions%252F&usg=AOvVaw2zE4iqBMjCW140R4F14PTT\">knew</a> Donna Brazile leaked debate questions to Hillary Clinton before Wikileaks released the e-mail proving it. As a result of the contacts those involved would then be vulnerable to coercion.</p>\n<p>In the above scenario many of the criminal elements existed, but Mueller could not prove an agreement even if the help was welcomed and Trump&rsquo;s team was kept in line after the fact <em>via</em> vague coercion. No <em>new</em> agreement took place. Indeed there was no need for a new agreement because the pattern of expectation and reward was pre-existing. The evidence in this regard was insufficient but it does serve as further evidence for other agreements for which there are ongoing investigations and possibly additional sealed indictments not directly related to the elections.</p>\n<p>Returning to Barr, it doesn&rsquo;t matter which of the three theories is correct, his summary letter is correct as it relates to the elections, and as it relates to sealed indictments about the elections. Nothing in that letter as Louise Mensch <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2019/03/25/william-barrs-wonderful-letter/\">pointed</a> out refers to indictments obtained by other offices. Nothing refers to ongoing investigations by other offices. In addition, Barr&rsquo;s letter clarifying his intent to deliver Mueller&rsquo;s report to congress stating that he would redact Grand Jury material lets us know that elections related evidence does play a part in ongoing investigations.</p>\n<h3><em>More on </em>c<em>oercion</em></h3>\n<p>It is implausible to believe that everyone in Trump&rsquo;s orbit who dealt with Russian intelligence or their cut-outs was not vulnerable. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/us/politics/paul-manafort-trial-verdict.html\">Manafort</a> certainly had a criminal or embarrassing past with Russians that rendered him susceptible to blackmail as understood by the security clearance process, so did <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/longtime-trump-adviser-roger-stone-indicted-by-special-counsel-in-russia-investigation/2019/01/25/93a4d8fa-2093-11e9-8e21-59a09ff1e2a1_story.html?utm_term=.e6bfb859d031\">Stone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mike-flynn-timeline-his-rise-fall-russia-call-n720671\">Flynn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/21/michael-cohen-former-trump-lawyer-feds-reach-plea-deal/1053562002/\">Cohen</a>. As Schindler, Chait, and others have pointed out, Trump was vulnerable too with massive <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-still-owes-lenders-including-deutsche-bank-as-much-as-480-million-2018-05-16\">debt</a>, past money <a href=\"https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-fines-trump-taj-mahal-casino-resort-10-million-significant-and-long\">laundering</a>, and history of <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/07/trump-putin-russia-collusion.html\">working</a> with Russian&rsquo;s against US interests, and campaign <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/michael-cohen-named-trump-individual-1-here-s-why-prosecutors-ncna947016\">finance</a> felonies. Trump, his family, and many members of his campaign may not be prosecuted for coordinating with the Russian election interferences that delegitimized the 2016 election. But they&rsquo;re far from being upright citizens unfairly accused of crimes that they benefitted from personally and financially. Worse than being mere career criminals, they are dupes for the Kremlin compromised by past crime and driven by destructive greed and they keep pressing themselves deeper into Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s willing arms.</p>\n<h3><strong>Barr and Rosenstein: A Bird&rsquo;s Eye View</strong></h3>\n<p>The SCO exhausted their investigation regarding the narrow issues they were tasked to examine. Mueller&rsquo;s investigation determined that Russia did <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=11&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiGyJiRyKDhAhVvh-AKHb7eArwQFjAKegQIAhAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F2018%252F02%252F16%252Fus%252Fpolitics%252Frussians-indicted-mueller-election-interference.html&usg=AOvVaw38Mh05Ri7m-Ap_Wo_ch4EC\">interfere</a> with the election, that they did hack Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign as well as Democratic and Republican organizations. We know from public reporting that there was evidence of coordination but according to Barr&rsquo;s summary letter it proved insufficient to recommend prosecution. We&rsquo;ve examined reasons why that might be. We know Mueller found there was evidence of obstruction of justice but <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj1qvXotaDhAhXlqlkKHeixDzYQwqsBMAB6BAgMEAQ&url=https%253A%252F%252Ftwitter.com%252FTheBeatWithAri%252Fstatus%252F1110302508201795584&usg=AOvVaw17S5ZPz9stB0CztFJpmPsv\">oddly</a> made no recommendations. Barr testified that there was no plan to <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?459560-1/attorney-general-barr-expects-release-mueller-report-week\">redact</a> evidence related to obstruction. This is in keeping with his opinion that congress is the proper body to assess the presidents abuse of power rendering any claims that he&rsquo;s trying to keep this information from congress to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/09/congress-mueller-report-226580\">protect</a> trump moot. It also indicates he&rsquo;s less likely to look countenance the obstruction issue without underlying indictments. He also made likely made counter-intelligence findings which as mentioned above we know nothing about yet. We have yet to deal with one side criticism. Was Barr sufficiently forthcoming in his summary letter from the standpoint of Special Prosecutor Mueller or members of his team?</p>\n<h3><em>Team Mueller&rsquo;s pushback</em></h3>\n<p>On April 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2019 the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/us/politics/william-barr-mueller-report.html\">reported</a> that some on Mueller&rsquo;s team told their aides that Barr&rsquo;s summary did not adequately capture the gravity of Trump and his campaign&rsquo;s connections with Russia. The following day The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/limited-information-barr-has-shared-about-russia-investigation-frustrated-some-on-muellers-team/2019/04/03/c98e8a02-567a-11e9-814f-e2f46684196e_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.11dea89c27de\">confirmed</a> this reporting with their own details. Subsequently NBC has confirmed the report adding their own additional <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/barr-didn-t-do-justice-mueller-report-officials-tell-new-n990776?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma\">color</a>. This has been framed as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AngrierWHStaff/status/1113656054062223360\">shot</a> across the bow aimed at Barr. That is a plausible read of it but overstated in a sense &ndash; as far as shots go this was more of a rubber band or sling shot than <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjY8ZuVnrrhAhXNnuAKHRBWAAkQwqsBMAN6BAgJEAo&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252Fwatch%253Fv%253DgG3kmsi_NHY&usg=AOvVaw0rf9TFtix9iXRZwyiZ8xP8\">Naval artillery</a>. The reports are hearsay within hearsay within hearsay. They have not been disputed publicly by anyone on Mueller&rsquo;s team but they are sourced to government officials with knowledge of what aides of some members of Mueller&rsquo;s team believe. The reports are certainly not coming from Mueller himself. So what are we to make of this?</p>\n<p>Is a preliminary matter Barr <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?459560-1/attorney-general-barr-expects-release-mueller-report-week\">testified </a>that he communicated with Mueller about the summary letter and that he asked if Mueller wanted to review it. Mueller declined. This undermines some of the criticism. Others have commented that these reports were meant as a low level or subtle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/1113829364406325248\">caution</a> to &ldquo;Trump and Company&rdquo; to let the entire lot of them know that Barr&rsquo;s actions look suspicious to a good many folks beyond the partisan pundits on the outside. These leaks let Barr know that if he&rsquo;s up to something bad he should reconsider. In another important way, these leaks actually help Barr. By putting the president and congressional Republican enablers on notice that he can&rsquo;t suppress any of their findings without making it near certain members of Mueller&rsquo;s team will testify to their findings publicly, the leaks give Barr ammunition to push back. If the president call in a rage demanding he keep evidence from congress, Barr can reply that if he tries it, it can be used as further evidence of obstruction at that members of Barr&rsquo;s team seem willing to testify to that before congress. Moreover, there is little the President nor the Department of Justice can do to stop those members who are no longer paid by the DOJ from testifying. These leaks give Barr leverage.</p>\n<h3><em>A bird&rsquo;s eye view of the DOJ, the Constitution, and history</em> </h3>\n<p>There is another aspect of these leaks that feels familiar to me as someone who was a government lawyer and Army Officer. The complaints read sound common, like complaints made by people working intensely in one area of a larger project that itself is part of an even larger project. Indeed because Mueller was given the opportunity to review the report and declined to do so it makes the team members complaining appear as though they did not see the entire picture. This is understandable and in a sense audible. In one&rsquo;s direct efforts, every piece of evidence can seem to be of ultimate import.</p>\n<p>Under good leadership this leads to constructive confrontation where the lower echelon officer in charge of a section of the project argues with the next echelon trying to impress upon higher the gravity or importance of the work. There is even <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/47175/breaking_ranks_dissent_and_the_military_professional\">guidance</a> for how to do this when rank is involved. Sometimes the lower echelon prevails, but often times decisions are made at high echelons based on information not directly available to the lower. That appears to be the case here. This pattern is true for junior and very senior experienced people. It&rsquo;s true in the civilian world as well as in the military. On a senior level these struggles are <a href=\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/turf-war\">called </a>a turf wars. The important take-away from this complaints is that irrespective of position these leaks demonstrate the alarm of parts of members of the team who have spent years of their lives working on this investigation but who may have been compartmented from other aspects of the DOJ and other Russia related investigations.</p>\n<p>The emotions driving the leaks are legitimate. I don&rsquo;t want to downplay them. It&rsquo;s frustrating when one&rsquo;s boss who has a birds eye view of the situation takes a different approach than the one you&rsquo;ve prepared for. Deeply. It&rsquo;s worse when that direction may have political reasons or at least be perceived to have them. I know this from personal experience in areas of conflict. I also know from personal experience that differing views are not a matter of right or wrong but of practical judgment regarding future effects. Elections matter. Like it or not, in this situation Barr doesn&rsquo;t just have a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the current DOJ, he has a living view of the history of the DOJ during times of social upheaval, and a long view of the constitutional jurisprudence surrounding the separation of powers. One can agree or disagree with actions taken, but those are practical matters that do not touch Barr&rsquo;s intent. Personally I find his experience and commitment to the defense of the Constitution and of America comforting even if I ultimately end up frustrated with his judgment.</p>\n<h3><em>The DOJ&rsquo;s response</em>. </h3>\n<p>The DOJ <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-addresses-reports-that-some-on-mueller-team-unhappy-with-barrs-letter-live-updates/\">responded</a> to these leaks pointing out that every page of the Special Counsel&rsquo;s report is marked as confidential. Louise Mensch <a href=\"https://patribotics.blog/2019/04/04/barr-barr-black-hat/\">points out</a> that this response falls into a grey area. The summaries involved were done to only require minor redactions at most. And the response does not refer to the summaries but the report. She leaves Barr&rsquo;s intent as a questions mark and ultimately concludes (correctly I believe) that it doesn&rsquo;t matter. There is nothing Barr can do to prevent the evidence collected by Mueller&rsquo;s team from coming to light.</p>\n<p>Barr <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?459560-1/attorney-general-barr-expects-release-mueller-report-week\">testified</a> to two issues in regards to the summaries. First, that the letter was his responsibility and he was responsible for its content. Taking responsibility rather than blaming controversial actions on others is the mark of a good leader and profoundly anti-Trumpian. Second, he stated that he did not like summaries, that he did not intend that his letter be read as a summary, and that he tried as best as possible to use Mueller&rsquo;s own language with regards to the information he provided opting instead to wait for the full release of the report before engaging in questions about something that as former FBI agent and CNN contributor Josh <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshscampbell\">Campbell</a> repeatedly points out &ndash; no one has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshscampbell/status/1113765387169030144\">read</a> yet.</p>\n<p>I would add that even summaries derived from low level classified information &ndash; information marked &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; still have to be vetted. In some ways it&rsquo;s more difficult because the question as to when a paraphrase or summary contains classified information is not always easy to determine, particularly when there is more at risk than might be readily apparent to the investigators. I see nothing in the DOJ&rsquo;s response that indicates Barr is risking prison in what would be the stupidest cover up in US history. Still, highly lawyered words that obfuscate some of the underlying issues are probably not the best move politically and Mensch&rsquo;s concerns have basis.</p>\n<h3><strong>Representative Schiff and the shifting law of grand jury secrecy</strong></h3>\n<p>There is no reason to doubt that Barr will release the Mueller report at this point. He stated during in <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?459560-1/attorney-general-barr-expects-release-mueller-report-week\">testimony</a> before congress that he would have a color coded redacted report with notes explaining the basis of the redaction within around a week. His statement was timely. The debate with regards to the report is now turning to redactions. Congress and the public in general rightly want to know what will or will not be <a href=\"https://www.nbc-2.com/story/40223635/the-release-of-the-mueller-report-is-coming-how-redacted-will-it-be\">redacted</a>. This issue is serious but the analysis cuts more in favor of heavy redactions and Barr&rsquo;s intent to color code the redactions provides the information necessary for congress to request additional information from Barr or to fight for that information in court.</p>\n<p>The DOJ <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000169-e024-dc59-a16d-e6f476bc0001\">indicated</a> that Barr&rsquo;s team will redact classified information, grand jury material, information related to other ongoing cases, third party sensitive personal information, and potentially material subject to executive privilege. Barr stated that he has no <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?459560-1/attorney-general-barr-expects-release-mueller-report-week\">intent</a> to redact any material based on executive privilege. There is little debate with regards to the redaction of classified information, uninvolved third parties, and personal information. The fight right now is over material related to specific grand jury investigations both ongoing and those which may have resulted in sealed indictments or which did not find probably cause to prosecute.</p>\n<p>Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has argued that grand jury information should not be redacted. He basis his argument on the fact that during the Watergate investigation, petitioned the court for the release of grand jury material and the court granted that permission. He&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1113845208641363969\">slammed</a> Barr over this demanding to know why he has not even requested that the court release any grand jury material.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the good representative&rsquo;s argument, <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\">others</a> pointed to a <a href=\"https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/C303D80209541E01852583D3004E0F21/$file/17-5149.pdf\">case</a> decided last week on appeal by a three judge panel in the DC circuit. Barr <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?459560-1/attorney-general-barr-expects-release-mueller-report-week\">stated</a> that he was bound by this decision. The case is history is summarized as follows:</p>\n<p>Historian Stuart A. McKeever appeals an order of the district court denying his petition to release grand jury records from the 1957 indictment of a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which McKeever sought in the course of his research for a book he is writing. The district court, lacking positive authority, asserted it has inherent authority to disclose historically significant grand jury matters but denied McKeever&rsquo;s request as overbroad. On appeal, the Government argues the district court does not have the inherent authority it claims but rather is limited to the exceptions to grand jury secrecy listed in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e).</p>\n<p>The opinion is split. The majority decision written by Senior Circuit Judge Ginsberg found that the DC District Court is bound by the specific enumerated exemptions to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure found under Rule 6(3)(3) relating to what can be released and that the district court did not have the authority to act outside of those specific exemptions. This at least temporarily limits the information that Barr could request from the court. Furthermore the case that was on appeal was not related to the Mueller report at all.</p>\n<p>Judge Ginsberg noted that the 7<sup>th</sup> circuit arrived at the <a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1748291.html\">opposite conclusion</a> creating a split in the circuits which could allow the Supreme Court to step in and solve the issue. There are good reasons in the dissenting opinion to disagree with the majority here. However, the disagreement is beside the point with regards to Representative Schiff&rsquo;s concern. Unless and until the full DC circuit, or the Supreme Court overturns the decision of the panel, the opinion is binding on the DC District Court. Moreover this case was argued September 21, 2018 well before Barr was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/14/senate-confirms-william-barr-1170020\">confirmed</a>, and months before acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker was <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/matthew-whitakers-appointment-acting-attorney-general-three-lingering-questions\">appointed</a> to the position. Since then Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/jeff-sessions-russia-trump-investigation-democrats.html\">recused</a> from the investigation, the only one who had purview over both was Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein who has not contradicted Barr&rsquo;s position with regards to redactions.</p>\n<p>Outside of the precedent and limitations this decision places on DC District Court, The this case completely invalidates the argument that Barr&rsquo;s failure to seek Grand Jury information is further evidence that his intent to redact Grand Jury material was nefarious. One might argue that he should still petition for the release of the information at district courts in other jurisdictions. However action of this sort work be inequitable. It would not be fair or in the interest of justice to apply a different set of rules to different targets in ongoing grand jury proceeding related to the same core issues and possibly involving co-conspirators.</p>\n<p>Moreover providing Grand Jury information is limited for a variety of <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6458&context=jclc\">reasons</a>. We want people to cooperate with Grand Juries. We do not want to prejudice ongoing cases with material that may be out of context. And we do not want to damage the reputations of individuals who may have been the subject of a Grand Jury proceeding but against whom the Grand Jury found no probable cause. Even here, the most damaging argument in favor of calling Barr a bad actor turns out to lack any basis. It was never a credible argument. Barr was in fact being a conscience actor following the rule of law as the DOJ had argued in the DC Circuit the entire time with regards to his intent to redact grand jury information in the Mueller report.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion:</strong> <strong>Is Barr a White Hat?</strong></h2>\n<p>Yes. Barr is a white hat. It&rsquo;s OK to hate him. It&rsquo;s OK to criticize his views of the law and of politics. He may not be acting in the way those opposed to President Trump like at this present point in history, but he is acting within the rule of law, and he believes with solid legal justification that he&rsquo;s acting for the benefit of all Americans in the long term by seeking to protect the power granted by the Constitution to the executive branch of the federal government. Mueller had a statutory <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.8\">obligation</a> to notify the Attorney General when he concluded his investigation. Similarly, Barr had a statutory <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.8\">obligation</a> to notify congress. Barr has multiple ongoing investigations to protect and a president who often demonstrates his willingness to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjis4aXuqPhAhVnS98KHcBYCrAQFjAAegQIARAB&url=http%253A%252F%252Fnymag.com%252Fintelligencer%252F2017%252F09%252Ftrump-flaunts-his-indifference-to-the-rule-of-law.html&usg=AOvVaw3GXA1g5RPyZjLy5aFRlo3j\">flaunt</a> the rules and norms to keep in check while national security is at risk because other criminal activities under investigation could still be used by hostile foreign intelligence assets to compromise a Trump. Barr&rsquo;s letter to congress at a bare minimum had to simultaneously report to congress as required by law, assure the president to avoid a constitutional crisis level meltdown, and protect ongoing investigations for as long as possible. It did all three.</p>\n<p>Like many contested issues where there is ongoing troubling activity there were some negative consequences to Barr&rsquo;s letter that helped fuel concern over his actions. Trump at least temporarily was able to claim a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=21&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjz38rctqDhAhUHc98KHUH-C2AQFjAUegQIABAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F2019%252F03%252F24%252Fus%252Fpolitics%252Ftrump-exonerated.html&usg=AOvVaw3bEsl5x4zWy8DPKzVSwRVn\">win</a>. His window of opportunity to make that claim credibly has already passed. Congress is scheduling Barr to testify. Representative Nadler on behalf of the House Judiciary Committee requested the full report by April 2, 2019. When it was not delivered by that time, the committee subsequently voted to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-panel-votes-to-authorize-subpoenas-to-obtain-full-mueller-report/2019/04/03/e0577b34-560e-11e9-814f-e2f46684196e_story.html\">authorize</a> a subpoena for the full report of the Special Counsel&rsquo;s investigation but as of this writing they have yet to issue the subpoena. The public will likely get a redacted copy of the report fairly soon. It&rsquo;s important to note that even in this state the report will be devastating for Trump and whatever redactions may exist will tell us quite a bit too.</p>\n<p>Likewise, Trump had a relatively short period of time to credibly attack journalists reporting his extra-official affairs and to try to pummel into submission the corporate organizations that provide those journalists with a platform and to shore up his base by trying to convince them that any new evidence that comes out is fake. His timeframe to successfully use this tactic in this regard too has passed. A reckoning is coming with regards to the multiple ongoing investigations particularly in the Southern District of New York and New York State &ndash; and this timeframe is reflected in his manic attempts to claim vindication.</p>\n<p>Barr has everything he needs to tell Trump to pound sand if asked to interfere with these investigations and little ability to do anything even if he wanted to. Moreover, he&rsquo;s already put his novel theory regarding obstruction into practice even if he claims he did not &ndash; and it may have been done to <em>protect</em> other prosecutions. As a result of his letter, Barr can now oversee those investigations in relative peace as Trump and his #MAGA supporters engage in their quixotic battle against the free press and the Democrats holding his administration in check. Finally, both Barr&rsquo;s letter notifying congress that he had received Mueller&rsquo;s report, and his summary report to congress already accomplished one very important thing. Those letters created near <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/news/435881-poll-84-percent-want-to-see-mueller-report\">universal</a> demand for the release of Mueller&rsquo;s report and ensured that every aspect of that report will be sought. By tailoring a narrow letter, by leaving so many questions, by drawing only one very conspicuous conclusion regarding obstruction, Barr gave a gift to journalists, pundits, Democrats, and the public: questions the public will demand answers to.</p>\n<p>While the process plays out, Trump will continue to use the opportunity to try to garner <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=6&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi65qSt06DhAhVln-AKHb9GAQcQFjAFegQIAhAB&url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.politico.com%252Fstory%252F2019%252F03%252F24%252Fmueller-report-trump-white-house-1234187&usg=AOvVaw0edUz31Bwu_t80Fsq-hgqf\">support</a> and to play to the media. He will go on and on about it at upcoming <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/rallies/\">rallies</a>. But the more the president saber rattles, the more damning any future criminal indictments will be. We should remain vigilant and continue to apply political pressure to release the report. We should hold a healthy skepticism with regards to Barr&rsquo;s conduct. He&rsquo;s far too comfortable with expansive executive power and far too uncomfortable with the laws that hold an abusive unfit would be dictator in check. Yet I understand why he holds those beliefs. Moreover I believe his own deeply held political views require him to hand the investigative materials over to congress and provide as complete a report as possible to the American people. He believes congress and US voters are the proper place and have the proper power to prosecute an American president.</p>\n<p>Even if you disagree with all of my conclusions, or even if all of my conclusions are ultimately wrong, I would encourage everyone to wait for the redacted report and the ongoing prosecutions with other DOJ and state prosecutors to finish before attacking the DOJ and condemning the AG. To do so risks further diminution of the rule-of-law already in the middle of one of the biggest pressure tests since the United States Civil War. One of the lessons I took away from working closely with local national populations in Iraq and Afghanistan is that one has to act decently and give trust if one wants to get trust and decency in return.</p>\n<p>So far the evidence suggests that Barr and the DOJ successfully protect federal law enforcement from the attacks of an angry president seeking to demean the investigation into Russia&rsquo;s interference with our elections by painting it as a partisan campaign against himself personally originated and conducted by &ldquo;Angry Democrats.&rdquo; Barr&rsquo;s notification letter went a long way towards rehabilitate the DOJ&rsquo;s image on the right just as his summary letter sought to distance the department from politics in order to preserve its legitimacy. He has protected the integrity of ongoing investigations, and in the end, protected America by giving the process and his prosecutors the space and peace needed to complete their investigations and to ensure that any crimes committed by the president and those close to him are brought to light and to justice while providing stability and the continued respect for rule of law. While he may appear to be wearing a black hat, sometimes good guys don&rsquo;t wear white.</p>\n<p><em>Patribotics is grateful to you for making this site possible.

                "text": "On Sunday afternoon March 24, 2019, Attorney General William Barr released a short four page summary letter summarizing his conclusions about Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s exhaustive report into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 Presidential Election. Barr\u2019s letter was greeted with shock by many of those who believed that he was going to reveal coordination between President Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. He did not. His brief summary was hailed as a total exoneration by the White House. For many information starved writers and the public in general seeking to vanquish a would-be autocrat or to vindicate a strong-man champion the desire to parse every word of Barr\u2019s brief letter in an attempt to understand as much as possible about Mueller\u2019s underlying report was insatiable. Hot takes, partisan press releases, editorials and explainers proliferated almost immediately.\nI break my analysis into multiple parts. First, I will examine Barr\u2019s history with the CIA and as Attorney General for President George H.W. Bush. Those segments of Barr\u2019s work history are currently being used as evidence that he is now acting with bad intent. I will also look at additional criticisms as well, and examine the desire for speed relating to the release of the full Mueller report. Next, I parse Barr\u2019s principled conclusion letter (summary) in the context framed by the notification to congress he sent hours after Special Counsel Mueller delivered his final report. In this section I will closely focus on the variations relating to who Barr references as targets of the investigation. In the following sections I examine how this letter was critically received focusing on the most damaging criticisms. I look at ideas posed by some attempting to make sense of Barr\u2019s summary with regards to information in the public record. I will focus briefly on the debate over redactions. Finally I look at the difference between an investigators view, an attorney general\u2019s view, and a long term constitutional view before engaging in a final analysis and conclusion.\nPatribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to donate, there are buttons around the site, or you could make a contribution here.\nMy goal here is to differentiate between political difference, legal malfeasance, and nefarious intent. We can expect the Attorney General to fight to secure executive power, we can expect him to defend the office of the president as opposed to the man, and we can expect him to defend any president with regards to the lawful use of the powers granted to the office as he understands them. We can expect a level of partisanship with regards to policy and resource prioritization. However, if we want to depolarize our politics, we can and indeed must avoid attributing nefarious intent to conscientious civil servants doing their duty in suboptimal situations. There is a fundamental difference in stance, a difference between questioning Barr\u2019s actions assuming neutral or partisan motives versus assuming intent to engage in criminal activity without solid evidence and using that assumption as a guide to draw conclusions about actions. The latter leads to fractured politics and should be avoided when possible. That brings us back to the title, is Attorney General William Barr a white hat?\nCoverup General\nWas Barr\u2019s decision to write a very short letter summarizing the conclusions of Mueller\u2019s report while working towards a more complete release indicative of a coverup or a good faith discretionary choice in a matter of grave national import? On this score, Barr was attacked from many angles. One of the key lines of attack is grounded in Barr\u2019s prior history prior history including his time at the CIA, advising President Reagan, and as Attorney General for President Bush. This history is used as evidence that his current summary letter was part of a coverup. But this line of attack is at best demonstrates the partisanship of a much younger and less experienced civil servant, not bad intent. It fails to take into consideration Barr\u2019s ethical obligations as an attorney or his specific role to protect the constitution by informing his actions with broad view of both history and of executive power.\nCIA\nLong before any of his alleged coverups took place Barr worked for the CIA beginning as an intern in 1971, then an intelligence analyst in 1973. In 1975 he transferred to the CIA\u2019s office of legislative counsel where his worked included acting as a liaison between the agency and congress during the period of time when two special committee investigations into intelligence abuses were ongoing and that produced transformative reports. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine the key experiences he must have gained during those formative years in terms of understanding congressional politics, of the checks and balances involved in the struggle between the executive and the legislative branches of our government, and of the enormity of the threats facing America during the Vietnam War while also in the middle of the Cold War. He worked for an agency tasked with countering the threats of communist governments in both China and Russia, threats he would see play out through Russia\u2019s attempted expansion into Central America during the Cold War and its continued threat after the implosion of the Soviet Union. Threats he would see play out in China\u2019s support for a communist takeover in Vietnam. As a trained analyst he had direct knowledge of Russia\u2019s basic tactics and capabilities. As a legislative liaison during a period where congress was investigating the executive branch, he had a parallel understanding of the weaknesses in our own constitutional republic \u2013 weaknesses that could be exploited by savvy hostile actors.\nPresidents Reagan and Bush\nIt is within the context of the former CIA employee who supported intelligence operations in the ongoing spy wars between the US and the former Soviet Union that we should understand his role in fighting for executive power. Such a fight, spanning multiple presidential administrations is not a fight for a particular president or party. It\u2019s a fight for the office of the president. To do otherwise results in contradictions. For example, is problematic to view Barr as pro-Russian espionage or pro-coverup given his CIA history and work for both President\u2019s Reagan and Bush. A more consistent interpretation of his legal advice during that period is to see it in the light of the struggle between executive and congressional power. In this light his role was to fight for America by aiding both Reagan and Bush\u2019s negotiate legal issues that resulted from the use of executive power related to their ongoing broader efforts to rescue hostages and open dialogue with Iran, contain Russian influence in Central America during the Cold War, negotiate with Russia to end the Cold War, and to reduce nuclear arms and protect national security related interests with regard to American oil investments in the Middle East. From another angle, nothing in his advice during either administration indicates he sought anything further than a preservation of the executive power to quickly or creatively act against perceived, intelligence validated threats, or to act on diplomatic opportunities \u2013 all by way of the tools lawfully available to the executive branch.\nIn both cases it is irrelevant whether or not the presidents knew or came to know that actions by their subordinates were illegal. Barr was only advising on the actions the presidents could lawfully take. Further, it is equally clear with the benefit of hindsight that while possibly the product of poor judgment or bad intelligence that both presidents believed that any illegal actions were done in defense of America and American interests as they saw them at the time they engaged in them and with the information they had available to them. Barr advised pardons. He also pushed back at congressional efforts to obtain executive material. Both are legitimate use of executive power. Barr\u2019s defense of the office preserved the power of the executive branch for future generations that might find themselves similarly situated regardless of party or of politics.\nPresently it would be absurd to suggest that either Attorney General Barr or Special Counsel Mueller are under any illusions as to Russia\u2019s capacity for subversion nor have they ever shown any love for Russian influence and espionage operations. To claim that a man with Barr\u2019s history is helping coverup Russian subversion of America without any evidence contrary to his history of fighting against Russia is not plausible. The accusations of coverup are partisan in origin and partisan in current application. That\u2019s fine but one can completely disagree with the politics or whether the pardon power should be modified with a constitutional amendment without attributing nefarious intent to the attorney who advises the president with regards to the legality of specific courses of action. It might help to flip party affiliation in order to gain a different understanding of what Barr advised Bush and Reagan. We can do that by creating a hypothetical situation connected to real life events.\nOsama Bin Laden \u2013 A Hypothetical\nIf we want good and conscientious presidents to have the power to protect the country on short notice, it is necessary to fight for that power in more problematic situations. We\u2019ve seen how an attorney fighting for the office advised in controversial situations. Let\u2019s see how that might play out in a far less controversial situation.\nOn May 1st, 2011 President Barack Obama announced to the world the death of Osama Bin Laden. Were President Obama\u2019s actions legal? More broadly, was the policy of targeted killing under President Obama\u2019s administration legal? My point here is not to reiterate the legal arguments on both sides. If one follows the hyperlinks one can see that not only did President Obama seek legal counsel regarding these operations, but that there was opposition and push-back. Reasonable legal scholars can and did find that President Obama\u2019s actions against Osama Bin Laden were illegal in a variety of respects. Should congress have tasked a special prosecutor to investigate?\nThe Republican controlled congress could easily have appointed a special counsel to dog the remainder of President Obama\u2019s first term and even recommended impeachment but investigating the Navy SEALs and the members of the Night Stalkers for killing America\u2019s number one enemy would have been politically suicidal for the GOP. Nonetheless \u2013 in this hypothetically, President Obama not only benefitted from the advice of his own attorneys but could have theoretically benefitted from AG Barr\u2019s advice regarding pardons just as President Bush did. Had congress chosen to go after the Navy SEALs, the Night Stalkers, or any of their commanders in an attempt to take down President Obama, no one would have batted an eye if Obama had pardoned them. The ability to act quickly without the benefit of extensive legal analysis is one we should want from any president regardless of party particularly since the Supreme Court does not issue advisory opinions.\nApplying past actions to present circumstances\nWith regards to Barr\u2019s past it is important to take a step back from current politics as terrible as they may be and look at the broader implications. It\u2019s helpful to adopt both a long view and a birds eye view of the office of the Attorney General, the office of the president. We should also keep in mind that attorneys have an ethical duty to zealously represent those offices in defense of the Constitution. From this view it\u2019s clear that whether one agrees with Barr\u2019s expansive view of executive power that it is both arguably justified in key moments of our national history and that his position fully comports with the rule of law as made explicit by the US Constitution. If one is looking to call Barr a bad actor based on his role as an attorney defending the office of the president in times of national crisis one will not find a solid basis to do so. It is important to understand that Barr knew of the perils he faced as well.\nAdditional Criticism\nBarr\u2019s unsolicited letter regarding obstruction\nOn June 8, 2018, Barr, then in private practice drafted a memorandum analyzing Federal Law governing obstruction of justice focusing on the specific issue of whether a sitting president engaged in lawful activity can be prosecuted by the executive branch for obstructing justice. He concluded that a president could not. He examines two specific acts by the president alleged at the time in the media to be the basis for potential obstruction charges: President Trump\u2019s firing of Director Comey, and his public comments with regards to General Flynn\u2019s innocence or leniency that the president felt should be applied.\nI\u2019m not going to go into the minutiae of his argument here. The basic gist of Barr\u2019s argument is that the Constitution grants the president plenary power over law enforcement. It is a duty the president cannot recuse from without abandoning the branch altogether. Barr does not argue that a president can engage in illegal acts such as witness tampering with the intent of exonerating himself from crimes, he argues that presidents can engage in facially lawful acts with regards to law enforcement issues that touch their personal conduct because they have ultimate discretion over how to proceed with executive branch law enforcement. If a president is charged with an underlying crime, federal obstruction charges are a \u201cside-show\u201d. If he is not charged with the underlying crime, neither the plain reading of the obstruction statute in question, 18 U.S.C. \u00a71512, the legislative history, its application, nor DOJ policy suggests that the mere intent behind facially lawful activity such as firing Directory Comey or commenting on Gen. Flynn\u2019s case is sufficient to fall within the purview of the statue. Barr\u2019s memorandum is limited to a very small subset of acts where the executive engages in Constitutionally lawful acts absent an underlying crime and as a result cannot be charged with obstruction. But that does not place the president above the law. He may still be impeached. He may still be charged with the underlying crimes. He may still be voted out.\nThe weakness in Barr\u2019s argument is evident when one asks: how can underlying crimes can be investigated if the president can lawfully pardon targets, call for lenient sentences, or fire the chief investigator. The answer again goes back congress. Congress has the power to investigate and punish the president. This is an extremely conservative view. It is the subject of debate amongst legal scholars, but it is not far outside the mainstream nor does it lack foundation in reason or constitutional jurisprudence. In short, one hopes that maintaining a conservative or legal view of constitutional jurisprudence is not grounds for attacking one\u2019s character.\nBarr\u2019s memorandum has been characterized as an audition of sorts to regain his role as Attorney General in a last ditch attempt to cling to power. It has been criticized as a baseless argument along the path of placing President Trump above the law. It has been used to justify claims that the Attorney General is actually the Coverup-General, a term first used against him by New York Times journalist William Safire in the New York Times decades ago. The fact that Barr chose to draft that memorandum was the subject of intense questioning by Senate Democrats during his confirmation hearing. Yet all of these criticisms demonstrate is that he has an extremely conservative view of the Constitution, legitimate grounds for debate but nothing suggests he\u2019s a bad actor. Barr expressly states that his analysis is limited solely to obstruction based on legal action by a president using his plenary authority over law enforcement where no underlying crime is charged. Moreover he states early on in his memorandum that obstruction charges related to Nixon were proper.\nSenator Harris \u2013 A hypothetical\nOne of Barr\u2019s main concern expressed in this memorandum was that it could create a situation where any lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion could become the subject of criminal prosecution. Let\u2019s look at another hypothetical created out of a real world situation. On April 8, 2019 CNN ran a story about a situation where Senator Kamala Harris, acting as a California district attorney and declined to seek the death penalty against a man who killed a San Francisco police officer. The CNN report was criticized almost immediately as a hit piece. How might this play out under the broad view of obstruction that Attorney General Barr argued against in his memorandum?\nFor purposes of this exercise I change Harris\u2019 position from state district attorney to a federal US attorney. We\u2019ll leave the rest of the facts the same. According to the linked CNN report, Harris exercise of her discretion was attacked by no less than United States Senator Feinstein at the time who opined that the case fell within the law regarding the death penalty and that it should be pursued. Harris\u2019 intent was criticized as at best being weak with innuendo about corrupt intent based on political motivations. Under the broad reading of obstruction, she could have been the subject of a criminal investigation based on her intent without any proof of an underlying crime \u2013 one could in effect simply make a criminal accusation, and even if the accusation was groundless a prosecutor could still be prosecuted for exercising her discretion. But this, as Barr rightly argues is untenable. It would essentially destroy prosecutorial discretion.\nFlipping the script in the memorandum\nBarr\u2019s memorandum, read in the proper light, is meant to both separate and protect the Department of Justice from politics and to protect executive power from diminution. In addition, I read it as a way to protect Mueller\u2019s investigation from having any potential charges overturned by the courts. Barr\u2019s memorandum is basically what any high level criminal defense attorney would argue were the president to be charged with obstruction. The fact that it is a legally sound argument founded in conservative jurisprudence means that it is likely to appeal to five of the nine Supreme Court justices. The worst case scenario is not that Barr cleared the president, it\u2019s if the Supreme Court does.\nThere is scant evidence that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein relied on this memorandum to justify their conclusion regarding the fact that both men found insufficient evidence to prosecute President Trump for obstructing justice with regards to a potential conspiracy on the part of members of his campaign to work with the Russian Government to hack and disseminate Democratic e-mail and personal information. One can however infer that at least Barr had his arguments in mind when he made his decision. His memorandum refers to corrupt intent. Yet even if he did consciously or unconsciously rely on his arguments, his memorandum is the exact opposite of bad action on Barr\u2019s part. I will analyze Barr and Rosenstein\u2019s conclusion further in two places below first in regards to Barr\u2019s summary letter directly, second in regards to its context the broader ongoing investigations.\nConclusion regarding Barr\u2019s take on obstruction in practice\nOn a final note, in testimony before congress Barr was clear that information regarding obstruction would not redacted from the release of Mueller\u2019s report. The public will be able to read the underlying evidence. Barr is not trying to coverup anything. He\u2019s not obstructing anything with regards to his analysis. No doubt there will be criticism over his decision, but such criticism will be with regards to his and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein\u2019s judgment, not with regards to any nefarious intent. If his judgment is wrong, congress will have all the evidence that they need to impeach the president.\nThe psychological need for speed\nAnother of the key issues driving concern over the release of the report is the perceived or real damage that the president is doing to our norms, laws, and international relationships. Many in the president\u2019s cabinet are under investigation for various acts of corruption. Some positions are not filled by Senate confirmed leaders and the administration has shown no interest in solving these issues in a timely manner that respects the rule of law and strengthens our relationships with our allies. Moreover, he may be financially beholden to hostile foreign countries and pose a grave threat to American national security. The only way to right all of these wrongs is to impeach the president. For two years from 2016 to 2018 the Republican controlled congress appears to have side-stepped their oversight duties. I assumed that during this period that Mueller was taking up the slack left by congress. I assume still that bad information contained in Mueller\u2019s report will change the political landscape and make it easier to impeach the president or at the very least to craft laws protecting against bad acts by those who may hold the office in the future. As a result of these assumptions I feel as though any delay in obtaining information in the report is a delay inviting further attacks on our national security and preventing congress from protecting against future abuse. I know I\u2019m not alone in these emotions. Indeed some fear Barr\u2019s summary is part of an overarching goal on the right to turn America into an autocracy.\nThe president and his camp put further psychological stress on those attempting to understand Barr\u2019s actions. The claims of exoneration and the expression of a vindictive desire to attack Democrats and journalists who covered any aspect of Mueller\u2019s investigation were unnerving and disheartening. But does anyone believe Trump would not have claimed vindication under any circumstances or that he would have foregone attacking the press? He attacked Mueller\u2019s investigation hundreds of times on Twitter alone. Barr\u2019s memo didn\u2019t cause the situation. In fact it deflected Trump\u2019s attacks from the actual Mueller report for a time. Barr became the target for the left and the source of unfounded optimism from the presidents camp.\nNonetheless, if one don\u2019t feel this urgency to halt at least some of President Trump\u2019s abuses it\u2019s likely you\u2019re either tuned out of politics or one unquestioningly supports the president. Those emotions are legitimate, real and in some cases devastating. In terms of politics the frustration may well cause voters to drop out political participation all together. However, are these emotions sufficient grounds for attacking Barr for not releasing Mueller\u2019s report immediately?\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is on record opposing impeachment. Her stated reasoning is that impeachment is incredibly divisive and we need to start to depolarize, \u201cHe\u2019s just not worth it\u201d, she says. She hedges her position by claiming that if \u2013 if something terrible comes out in the Barr memo congress will revisit this issue. It\u2019s unclear what she would consider impeachable if violations of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause or abuse of the security clearance process or the president\u2019s own stated grounds for locking someone up \u2013 use of non-secure e-mail which was used by his daughter and son-in-law while in the White House are insufficient. In one sense she\u2019s right. If the Senate will not convict, the cost benefit analysis weights against impeachment, divisive polarization and the potential that it will result in unnecessary Democratic losses in the 2020 election are huge costs.\nThere are counter-arguments. The one I find most persuasive does not rely on the Senate. It\u2019s irrelevant whether the Senate will convict or I\u2019d add what comes out of the Mueller report. The House has a duty to follow the law. Impeachment in the House even without conviction in the Senate would a strong message to future presidents that Trump\u2019s level of incompetence and corruption will not be tolerated. It would negatively set him apart in history from all but a couple of past presidents. And it would shows strength on behalf of the House Democratic majority against corruption and for the rule of law. However none of this relates to Barr\u2019s timing on the release of Mueller\u2019s report for two reasons.\n\u201cTo delay justice is.injustice,\u201d writes William Penn. However, as argued above there are already grounds to impeach President Trump in addition to the emoluments clauses and the presidents abuse of power particularly with regards to the security clearance process. Clear evidence in the public record that he abused his power to curtail the investigation into his own campaign is just one more reason to impeach him. While Mueller\u2019s report may provide additional grounds or evidence, the Democratically controlled House has what it needs to impeach the president and has chosen not to act. So far there is no reason to believe that reticence in the House will change. Therefore, the only ones delaying justice are members of the US House of Representatives based on political calculations, and Senate Republicans for the same reason but geared towards a different outcome. As such, impeachment would at best be a symbolic and precedent setting act by the House which is important but which does not require speed nor does it satisfy the desire for justice.\nFinally, Barr testified that the Special Counsel regulation written during the Clinton administration in the wake of the unnecessary publication of vast amounts of personal, private, and embarrassing information in the Star Report was an attempt to protect the privacy of those in future Special Counsel reports. He noted that while the regulation does not require him to provide the full report, in his discretion he decided that it was important to have the full report minus redactions. He further stated that the report would be ready within a week. There will be disputes based on the redactions. That is to be expected. Nonetheless, the fact that he will release a several hundred page report within a month of receipt substantially undermining any argument that he is engaged in a stalling tactic aimed to obstruct congressional oversight of the Trump administration.\nA desire for speed while apparently close to universally felt in virtually all of the political anti-trump groups is not a legal or even a political necessity. It\u2019s arguably a moral necessity, and it\u2019s absolutely a personal and psychological necessity for some of us. But while the emotional concern and moral obligations are real and legitimate and the concern over what the president is doing to our norms and relationships and the rule-of-law border on being a duties in themselves they doesn\u2019t translate into solid legal or political arguments against Barr\u2019s tactics nor do they impugn his character.\nBarr\u2019s Summary \u2013 Who in the World is He Writing About?\nMany writers have parsed Barr\u2019s summary. I want to focus on one very specific area: who he included and who he excluded in his references. After explaining the overarching logistics of the investigation Barr separates his own summary into three parts. First, Barr provides a brief overview of the report. He explains that Mueller\u2019s report had two main parts: a sections regarding Russian election interference via propaganda, and a section that regarding Russian hacking computers and disseminating e-mails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, the Democratic party and affiliates. Barr ends this initial paragraph with a quote from Mueller\u2019s report, \u201cThe investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\u201d [emphasis added]. Pay attention to those words because Barr alters them in three different ways in his summary. Mueller confines his pronouncement to \u201cmembers of Trump\u2019s campaign\u201d yet even in this initial paragraph Barr adds \u201cor associates\u201d to his own take. Finally Barr adds a third section regarding obstruction of justice to his own summary. The obstruction material according to Barr is found in the second section of Mueller\u2019s report.\nUS persons who were duped into helping the IRA\nBarr paraphrased Mueller\u2019s report regarding alleged coordination with members of the Russian organization known as the Internet Research Agency (IRA) whose primary purpose was to disseminate propaganda aimed to sow discord amongst US citizens. He paraphrases Mueller\u2019s report to say that it did not \u201cany US person or Trump campaign official, or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts\u2026\u201d [emphasis added] Why add the words \u201cUS persons\u201d and the legal term of art \u201cknowingly\u201d? Those words have specific statutory meaning referring to both US citizens as well as foreign individuals legally residing in the United States. It seems likely that he means to reference at least in part unsuspecting social media users who participated in disseminating IRA propaganda or who helped the IRA organize real world protests but that is not entirely clear from the context. Next notice that Barr modifies the word \u201cmembers\u201d to \u201cofficial, or associate\u201d again further limiting Mueller\u2019s words to exclude those outside Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Were Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Roger Stone, or Michael Cohen \u201cofficial[s] or associate[s]\u201d after they left the campaign? Finally, notice he limits the conspiracy and coordination to those directly with the IRA. He mentions Wikileaks in a subsequent paragraph \u2013 why not here? Was there knowing coordination non-campaign officials or associates such as Paul Manafort sharing internal polling data with non-IRA Konstantin Kilimnick?\nUS persons who knowingly worked with Guccifer 2.0 to disseminate hacked e-mail\nNext, Barr turns to Russian military hacking. He uses interesting language here. He describes those who had their computers hacked as \u201cpersons affiliated with the Clinton Campaign and the Democratic Party organizations.\u201d Why didn\u2019t he use \u201cofficials\u201d or \u201cassociates\u201d? Barr\u2019s use of \u201caffiliated with\u201d here suggest he meant to be very specific when referring to potential targets of the investigation from Trump\u2019s team. He also states that the e-mails were disseminated through \u201cvarious intermediaries, including Wikileaks.\u201d [Emphasis added]. A number of writers and publications were in direct or indirect contact with Guccifer 2.0 and disseminated information and analysis of hacked material.\nBarr acknowledges that Russia uses intermediaries but then limits his conclusion, \u201cthe Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian Government in these efforts despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.\u201d First, notice Barr adds \u201cor anyone associated with it\u201d to Mueller\u2019s quote. Next he does not include the word \u201cknowingly\u201d as a modifier for coordinated as he did in his paragraph on propaganda. Third, Barr uses the word \u201caffiliated\u201d as with Clinton above suggesting by affiliated he intends to refer to both officials and intermediaries. But it\u2019s striking and strange that he says that the campaign had offers from the affiliates but didn\u2019t coordinate with the government. Did Mueller find coordination between the targets and the affiliates? Fourth, he does not include \u201cUS persons\u201d as he did in the propaganda section. Those US persons who interacted with Guccifer 2.0 and disseminated hacked e-mails provided to them by the Russian government should contact their lawyers. Finally, how does Barr or Mueller understand the term campaign? As above do past members such as Roger Stone or Carter Page count? Were they still affiliated? What about George Papadopoulos? Are acts of campaign officials limited to the time they were part of the campaign and before?\nObstruction under severely limited circumstances\nBarr\u2019s third section on obstruction of justice is three paragraphs \u2013 more space than his entire overview and breakdown of the report and conclusions. In the opening paragraph he provides a summary of an outline of the report. He states that the Special Prosecutor looked at a variety of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions in an attempt to determine whether they constituted obstruction of justice. \u201cMost\u2026have been the subject of public reporting.\u201d He notes that Mueller addressed the obstruction issue in the second section of his report and that he did not, \u201cdraw a conclusion \u2013 one way or the other \u2013 as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction.\u201d He continues, \u201cInstead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as \u201cdifficult issues\u201d of law and fact concerning whether the president\u2019s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction\u201d [Emphasis added]. Finally, he quotes the Special Counsel, \u201c\u201dwhile this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u201d How many actions were taken by the president? What has not been the subject of public reporting? Why didn\u2019t Mueller draw conclusions? Why did then conclude that the evidence does not exonerate Trump? What other crimes, if any, did Mueller find evidence of obstruction?\nBarr\u2019s second and third paragraphs explains that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein drew their own conclusion \u2013 that evidence was insufficient to establish that Trump obstructed justice. He writes that his conclusion was not based on his memorandum discussed above. Rather, he again quotes the Special Counsel, \u201cthe evidence does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,\u201d Barr explains the elements of the crime: acting with corrupt intent, obstructive conduct, and a nexus to pending or contemplated proceedings. Barr does not discuss the evidence. He merely states they did not find all three elements could be proved \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d. In addition, Barr\u2019s quote is limited solely to election interference. Finally, it seems from the quote attributed to Mueller that he\u2019s grounding his determination on corrupt intent. If so, it\u2019s hard to see how he did not at least have some of the arguments from his memorandum in mind guiding his conclusion. On that issue we are left to speculate for now. Nonetheless, until we have a more complete picture of the full report there is no basis to draw any conclusion with regard to Barr\u2019s intent. The only position he personally takes in this memorandum is consistent with his defense of executive power and inconsistent with corruption.\nThe Summary Reception of Barr\u2019s Summary Letter\nAlmost immediately upon release of the letter a number of writers derided Barr as a the president\u2019s man installed to do Trump\u2019s bidding. Though some of those arguments have a rational basis which I will discuss below, I don\u2019t find any particularly compelling as to Barr\u2019s intent or character. Barr has limited ability to assist in a coverup and little incentive to do so beyond his conservativetake on obstruction of justice as it applies to the presidency and an out of the main stream belief in executive power.\nBarr\u2019s notification letter: disempowering Trump\u2019s Twitter feed\nStepping back a few days Barr\u2019s summary is framed by his notification to congress that he had received the Special Counsel\u2019s report. In this notification Barr dismantles the president\u2019s attacks on both the Special Counsel and the DOJ. The notification states that there were no instances where the Attorney General or Acting Attorney General found that Mueller\u2019s actions were inappropriate or unwarranted. This is both under-reported and extremely important because it means that Mr. Manafort\u2019s convictions as well as Lieutenant General Flynn\u2019s and Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s pleas and the rest of the pleas and indictments are not the result of what the president and the Russian propagandists at Sputnik called an out of control \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by a gang of \u201cangry Democrats\u201d nor were any of the ongoing prosecutions that were referred to multiple other DOJ offices. His notification negated the arguments put forth by Manafort\u2019s team that Mueller acted outside of his authority. It vindicates that judges who arrived at the same conclusion.\nReturning to Barr\u2019s summary letter\nAs noted above there are still multiple ongoing DOJ, and state investigations. Nothing in Barr\u2019s letter rules out the possibility that the evidence the Special Counsel\u2019s Office (SCO) uncovered with regards to election interference and hacking may by bolstered by ongoing work from other DOJ offices and prosecutors to the extent that it might rise to the level of prosecution at some point. The investigations in many cases always involved multiple offices. His letter was limited to Mueller\u2019s report and really to an extremely limited read of that report. But who was he writing his report for?\nMy analysis in the following paragraph is purely speculative. Public outcry and congressional pressure were easily foreseeable to anyone and particularly to someone with Barr\u2019s long political history and the decades of attacks on his character. It seems equally clear that while those effects understood that the general public and congressional Democrats were not his primary audience. His primary audience, the one who reacted positively to the letter and the underlying report \u2013 at least initially was President Trump. It is likely given the circumstances that Barr sought to placate a deeply insecure and nervous president. Barr knows better than most that the president holds the nuclear codes. He knows that Trump has the power to cause all manner of chaos. To the extent the letter kept the lid on the pressure cooker by placating Trump it did a service \u2013 it bought time for other investigations while maintaining stability. The worst outcome is something which Trump does anyway \u2013 attack both the Democrats and the media. There are other positive aspects of Barr\u2019s letter too.\nBarr\u2019s Letter \u2013 the Upshot\nThe upshot of Barr\u2019s willingness to take the heat for his letter and the president\u2019s belief in his own vindication is that it leaves the DOJ, FBI, and state law enforcement professionals to continue their work well out of the limelight and media spectacle surrounding the 2016 election investigation. Barr\u2019s letter also resulted in Trump going on record at least initially to say that the Mueller report should be released. He later walked that back but that act in itself was politically bad for Trump and his attempts to put the Mueller genie back in the bottle undoubtedly left more of a paper trail. Finally, stalling is of no political benefit to Trump who desires nothing more than to put the entire investigation behind him. In taking time to do proper reductions, ask the proper questions, provide the best information to congress and the American people while still assuring folks that they will obtain the necessary, Barr\u2019s letter and his subsequent updates and responses to questions keeps information about ongoing investigations away from those in congress such as Devin Nunes who themselves may be the subject of ongoing DOJ investigations.\nBarr\u2019s Experience Matters\nBarr is far from being inexperienced prosecutor. He was Mueller\u2019s boss at one point. He knows directly and experientially that lawyers and journalists will parse every word he writes and that his words can have enormous political consequences. He knows that his own actions and communications with Trump might be investigated and perhaps even construed as a part of an attempt to obstruct justice. However, there are some important facts to keep in mind. Barr in now sixty-eight years old. While he may have taken some risk in the past with regards to his reputation and provided some legal advice that allowed for attacks on his character little in Barr\u2019s lengthy work history suggests he is the type to gamble his reputation and legacy at this point for an incompetent president who at the end of the day may prove to be little more than a low rent Mafioso. Even in his confirmation hearing he stated that, \u201cI feel I\u2019m in a position in life where I can do the right thing and not really care about the consequences,\u201d Others writers are less optimistic.\nReading Will Saletan\u2019s read\nWill Saletan reads Barr\u2019s summary as a defense for Mr. Trump by his handpicked Attorney General. Underlying Saletan\u2019s opinion about Barr\u2019s motives lie questions that run parallel to some of my own. Why did Mr. Barr choose to quote Mueller limiting his conclusions to a those involving a conspiracy with the Russian government or the IRA and not \u201ccut outs\u201d or those used as intermediaries by the Russian government. One primary purpose for using intermediaries is to shield both the Russian Government and their sources from these types of charges.\nSaletan focuses on the way Barr limited his letter to \u201celection interference activities\u201d. He points out, as does Tom Nichols that not all of the president\u2019s attempts to work with Moscow were elections related. Is Mueller\u2019s report limited to elections interference? No, we\u2019ve linked evidence of ongoing investigation that originated in Mueller\u2019s investigation above. At the very least he would have explained why he transferred cases to other DOJ offices as part of the requirements of the report. Mueller was tasked to conduct a counter-intelligence investigation as well. Does his report have a counter-intelligence aspect. If so, we know nothing of what Mueller concluded. Why did Barr limit his conclusions to these two areas knowing that limiting his letter in this manner would all but necessitate congressional hearings? The intent to engage congress seems even more plausible in light of the fact that Barr believes congress is the proper body to investigate the president. Yet if that\u2019s the case it that suggests good intent with regards to the Attorney General.\nSaletan has additional arguments including an entire section on the odd issue of Barr\u2019s decision to decline further pursuit of Trump\u2019s alleged obstruction of justice. Barr was certainly aware his decision not to move forward with obstruction of justice charges would be called into question because he took pains to explain that he was not basing his decision on that memo in his summary letter. Further, he was grilled on this during his confirmation hearings. He knew that by including this issue in his letter his decision would be viewed at best as a form of legal confirmation bias and at worst part of Trump\u2019s own attempts to coverup alleged criminal activity. Why include a section in the letter on obstruction if not to ensure congress would investigate it?\nKatyal\u2019s Critique\nA number of other writers have weighed-in on the obstruction issue attacking Barr\u2019s conception of obstruction. Neal Katyal who notably drafted the Special Counsel regulations while an attorney at the DOJ writes the most in-depth criticism. He raises numerous serious questions that hit at the core of Barr\u2019s position. Katyal focuses on what he believes to be Barr\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Trump\u2019s actions did not demonstrate the \u201ccorrupt intent\u201d element of the crime. He questions how could Barr arrive at this conclusion without anyone interviewing Trump? Katyal further explains that it\u2019s important to understand why Mueller did not seek to compel an interview. But Katyal\u2019s question is itself is grounded in a political and legal assumption regarding the separations of powers. Did Mueller conclude that it would be better for the AG to conduct the interview? Was he leaving it for congress?\nThe most serious criticism Katyal levies is to question whether Mr. Barr sought to enshrine the view he expressed in his pre-nomination memo. He writes,\n[Barr\u2019s] unsolicited memo should be understood for what it is, a badly argued attempt to put presidents above the law. If he used that legal fiction to let President Trump off the hook, Congress would have to begin an impeachment investigation to vindicate the rule of law.\nIt\u2019s helpful to step back and examine this from another angle. Barr is aware that if his take on federal obstruction law were to be accepted it would become a precedent that could be used by presidents from any party and that\u2019s at the heart of his position. He knows that experientially because he worked for multiple administrations. He knows that logically as well. Yet this argument against Barr misses the mark with regards to any potential corruption on behalf of the Attorney General. It\u2019s further evidence for the interpretation of Barr\u2019s actions that I\u2019ve argued. He\u2019s not interested in helping Trump. Barr is defending executive power in general and his own particular view of executive power specifically. At worst one could argue that this position goes against Barr\u2019s judgment but there is no basis to use it as evidence against his character or patriotism. That\u2019s a key distinction. One can and should question his judgment without attacking his character.\nMoreover, would Barr risk one of his deeply held beliefs with regards to executive power and decades of work on behalf of America simply to exonerate someone against facts uncovered during the investigation? In other words, if the president is indicted and impeached and Barr helped to cover it all up, Barr implodes as an accessory after the fact and so does his life\u2019s work. The cost benefit analysis based on existent credible evidence weights heavily against it.\nIt\u2019s incomprehensible to assume he hasn\u2019t contemplated the consequences of personally exonerating Trump based on his controversial interpretation of a federal statute and constitutional separation of powers or that such actions would remain hidden. Additionally, as someone who served in the CIA and under Presidents Reagan and Bush he must have some concerns that President Trump might be compromised or at least vulnerable to being compromised by Vladimir Putin. He seems willing to act to support his interpretation of obstruction generally and executive power more broadly but nothing in his actions to date suggest treachery and lawlessness. With that in mind let\u2019s move from Barr\u2019s critics in the anti-Trump camp to an examination of the reaction to Barr\u2019s letter from Trump\u2019s side.\nCompromised\nIn the wake of Barr\u2019s letter Trump and his allies immediately declared victory. Per their standard operating procedures (SOP) they are aggressively engaged in attacks on reporters and politicians with a zeal that borders on self-parody. Sarah Huckabee Sanders posted a march madness style bracket list of journalists who as David Frum points out were far more accurate than the President himself with regards to his own and his campaign\u2019s connections with various Russians. In short, the Trump camp is irrationally ecstatic with Barr. Trump even praised Mueller after his letter. As mentioned briefly above, despite the usual Trumpian autocratic cosplay, it looks at this point like Barr accomplished one thing. He maintained a modicum of stability in the executive branch. Trump might be going full authoritarian performance art mode but so far he\u2019s not starting a war with North Korea to distract from Mueller\u2019s report at this point. Barr gave Trump his confidence back.\nNow we need to ask: Did Barr give the president false confidence? As a matter of public record we know there were many contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. We know there were offers for to assist from intermediaries of the Russian government forwarding offers from the Russian government. We know that those offers were at least tacitly accepted. We know there was offer to lift sanctions prior to inauguration. What we don\u2019t know is whether members of Trump\u2019s team had the requisite knowledge that the Russia operatives they were dealing with were intelligence agents, or whether they had the intent required to satisfy that mental element of any potential crime that might fall under the non-legal term \u201ccollusion\u201d. We know Russia relies on the use of intermediaries in part to sow this type of confusion. It\u2019s possible that conspiring with cut-outs rather than official foreign government agents is indeed a loophole in US law that needs to be fixed going forward. Former NSA spook John Schindler puts it in snark relief: \u201cApparently it\u2019s ok to conspire against a US election as long as the guys you\u2019re secretly parlaying with aren\u2019t wearing \u2018Hi, I\u2019m GRU\u2019 t-shirts.\u201d\nBut is it really plausible to say that Trump\u2019s family and courtiers didn\u2019t know they were dealing with Russian intelligence personnel or cut-outs? There is ample reason to believe this is pretty far-fetched particularly given that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign put out ads which accurately depicted the connections between Trump, his campaign, and Russia. Indeed Trump\u2019s team seemed to know something wasn\u2019t right because the candidate and his campaign lied about all the contacts \u2013 a lot. Moreover, at the very least, upon receiving security clearances campaign members would have been briefed that foreign nationals might try to gather information and told to report contacts. It\u2019s difficult to see why Mueller would not have at least brought this to a Grand Jury to determine probable cause or why if he did it didn\u2019t result in indictment. Unless as Louise Mensch reports there are indictments obtained and sealed outside the purview of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation. I tend to believe that. Most of the public was shocked when George Papadopoulos\u2019 indictment was unsealed. He wasn\u2019t even on most of our radars. Folks were less shocked when Roger Stone\u2019s indictment was unsealed. So we know Mueller\u2019s team had some sealed indictments. Nonetheless, on Mensch\u2019s reporting as it relates to the future we\u2019ll have to wait for further information to develop to confirm. In the meantime, I want to look at one more possibility as well that may converge in some way or at some point with Mensch\u2019s report.\nThree possibilities\nAs a preliminary matter lets question two theories floating about the internet. One might conclude that Trump and his enablers are so incredibly stupid and incompetent they just went along blindly and clueless with Russian intelligence assets. This seems entirely plausible at least initially and an early spokesperson for Trump\u2019s legal team made exactly this argument with an anecdote about Trump and Hope Hicks. NBC also reported that Mueller\u2019s team had an internal dispute regarding this conclusion. However the similarity between the position of those in the Trump camp and the NBC report raises the question of which government officials NBC sourced their story from. Moreover, on reflection given Manafort\u2019s, Gates\u2019s, and Stone\u2019s participation in the campaign, this conclusion does not come across as plausible. That trio knew exactly what they were doing. Like Trump they\u2019d been playing this game for decades.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, perhaps the Trump camp was comprised of evil geniuses so adept at espionage they were able to hide all evidence of coordination from NSA and FBI counter-intelligence. However, Russian communications were intercepted. Gen. Mike Flynn, Commanding General of the Defense Intelligence Agency\u2019s communications with the Russian embassy was intercepted. Navy SEAL Eric Prince was intercepted negotiating with Russians in the Seychelles. Neither Trump nor his campaign members nor Russian intelligence outsmarted the five eyes intelligence community. They were neither too stupid nor too smart to avoid indictment. Trump and members of his campaign were however both experienced and vulnerable.\nThe middle path\nI\u2019m relying in part on some of Tom Nichol\u2019s and John Schindler\u2019s writing herethough nothing their including should not be read to indicate their agreement.Given the problems with the two above theories, it seems more likely that campaign personnel were slowly encouraged into going along with Russia\u2019s efforts to damage Hillary Clinton and sow discord by Russian business and intelligence connected \u201cfriends\u201d. Maybe these friends casually made mention of past prior embarrassing financial or criminal activity as a gentle sort of stick. The Russians held a variety of incentives to offer as a carrot too from assistance with the election to a deal for Trump Tower Moscow. The Trump family has been working with Russians for a very long time. I suspect that Donald Trump Sr., Manafort, Stone, Gates and maybe even some of Trump\u2019s children experienced a vague unease about not cooperating and a greed and vanity driven desire to cooperate.\nI believe Mueller could not obtain sufficient evidence to prosecute Trump and his campaign regarding elections hacking and propaganda because instead of entering into a criminal agreement to alter the 2016 election they simply acquiesced to the Kremlin\u2019s operation as targets of Russian influence because they already knew the process. I believe the evidence of their interactions with regards to the election will be used in subsequent prosecutions and as noted above it may already have resulted in indictments on other charges.\nTrump\u2019s team knew their participation could prove embarrassing and possibly criminal if they were caught yet still felt compelled and attacked to going along as a result of vague incentives and coercion. This means that there was no Hollywood style handler issuing orders at a drop site and also not evidence of an agreement or intent. The agreement was set decades ago and resulted in a system that was already in place after decades of work. On a related side-note, the attempt by the world\u2019s intelligence communities to avoid having powerful government or related individuals compromised is the reason we have security classification and security clearance background checks and why those checks are updated in real time via monitoring and periodically by means of investigation. This is why Trump\u2019s abuse of that process is so troubling.\nNo duress in a legal sense\nI want to be clear. I\u2019m not suggesting that the SCO concluded that members of Trump\u2019s family and campaign were prohibited from agreeing to coordinate because they were under duress. They weren\u2019t forced into an agreement or forced to engage in illegal activity per se. This wasn\u2019t a violent mob threat with some enforcer dangling Donald J. Trump Jr. off the top of Trump Tower demanding the president engage in espionage. From an prosecution point of view \u2013 even if it an agreement to work with the Russians had been coerced, a duress defense would be made during plea negotiations or a during a prosecution and it would require the one claiming duress to prove that they were under an imminent threat of physical harm at the time they coordinated. I mean something very different here.\nCompromised \u2013 a toned down take\nThis situation I\u2019m describing would be more akin to the use of kompromat by Russian intelligence in a manner along the lines of what Tom Nichols describes here:\n\u2026 how would such compromising work in practice? \u2026[some] might be watching too much television. This is not an episode of The Americans. No one issues orders, and anyone looking for such evidence is likely to be disappointed. Rather, over time, as relationships grow, favors are asked. Friendships are pressed into service. The key is to induce the target to do what you want without telling him to do it\u2014to be a friend, helping out friends.\nJonathan Chait\u2019s article \u2013 criticized in a friendly way by Tom Nichols in the piece I took the above quote from drew this conclusion in a crime thriller sensationalistic type of way last year. I\u2019m not joining or attempting to reiterate either of their efforts here nor mimic the work of John Schindler with regards to assessing Russian subversion efforts. Rather, Russian subversion and the business history are helpful to explain why Mueller\u2019s team found a vast amount of evidence but also found it difficult to satisfy the mental elements of the crime when the players involved were both experienced and knew at least to an extent what the Russian\u2019s were up to in regards to their elections related crimes. Chait\u2019s most recent article revisits his conclusions specifically citing the the Moscow tower deal. But he uses it as a victory lap over his previous report rather than a possible explanation of why the president and his entourage were not charged regarding the elections interference.\nWith this possibility in mind it\u2019s interesting review in broad strokes the now infamous meeting to see exactly how it\u2019s plausibly that Barr or Mueller might conclude that meeting and other meetings and communications like it did not result in itself in an agreement by to coordinate with the Russian government but was instead a continuation of ongoing relationships that also became the foundation of more kompromat going forward.\nRe-imagining the scene at Trump Tower\nHere\u2019s the scene. Russian business people connected to and members of the Russian government expressing interest in doing business with Trump. They float a Moscow Tower deal, loans, or help with Trump\u2019s election. They\u2019re interested in cultivating a popular and potentially powerful man. Trump knows the players, he knows what they want, he\u2019s deal with them before. These business people through a lawyer who herself is connected to Russian Intelligence arrange a meeting. During this meeting the float various campaign related incentives to Paul Manafort with whom they\u2019ve done business with in the past, Donald Trump Jr. who has bragged about the Trump organization doing a large amount of business with Russia, and Jared Kushner who has his own ties personally and via his wife. All three had varying levels of experience.\nThe president, his family, and those around him already know how these types of business deals work because Donald Trump Sr. has been working with Russians since at least 1987. They all already know what they need to do. They go along with the hacking a dissemination because it benefits them but they don\u2019t know at the time what they\u2019ll get out of the deal. The do know that at some point they\u2019ll be \u201cpressed into service.\u201d They don\u2019t even need to be asked twice even though they were asked multiple times. They\u2019re thrilled for the help.\nAs campaign members engage in their part of the vague deal to damage Hillary Clinton and divide America they are providing their Russian counterparts with even more compromising information against themselves. And, they do in fact believe this information might implicate them in criminal activity or at the least be deeply embarrassing, politically damaging, and potentially delegitimizing with regards to the results of the elections. Maybe the threats are never spoken \u2013 but Trump and his family know that they exists and they know what they need to do to stay on Vladimir Putin\u2019s good side.\nIn a situation like the one described above there would be no criminal conspiracy to coordinate with the Russian Government or their cut-outs to throw the 2016 election and no basis to prosecute despite strong evidence for various elements of the crime. The agreement, direction, and specifics of the quid pro quo would be missing. Sure there was a meeting. Sure there were e-mails released. Trump\u2019s campaign may have even had access to them before dissemination. Recall how Trump knew Donna Brazile leaked debate questions to Hillary Clinton before Wikileaks released the e-mail proving it. As a result of the contacts those involved would then be vulnerable to coercion.\nIn the above scenario many of the criminal elements existed, but Mueller could not prove an agreement even if the help was welcomed and Trump\u2019s team was kept in line after the fact via vague coercion. No new agreement took place. Indeed there was no need for a new agreement because the pattern of expectation and reward was pre-existing. The evidence in this regard was insufficient but it does serve as further evidence for other agreements for which there are ongoing investigations and possibly additional sealed indictments not directly related to the elections.\nReturning to Barr, it doesn\u2019t matter which of the three theories is correct, his summary letter is correct as it relates to the elections, and as it relates to sealed indictments about the elections. Nothing in that letter as Louise Mensch pointed out refers to indictments obtained by other offices. Nothing refers to ongoing investigations by other offices. In addition, Barr\u2019s letter clarifying his intent to deliver Mueller\u2019s report to congress stating that he would redact Grand Jury material lets us know that elections related evidence does play a part in ongoing investigations.\nMore on coercion\nIt is implausible to believe that everyone in Trump\u2019s orbit who dealt with Russian intelligence or their cut-outs was not vulnerable. Manafort certainly had a criminal or embarrassing past with Russians that rendered him susceptible to blackmail as understood by the security clearance process, so did Stone, Flynn, Cohen. As Schindler, Chait, and others have pointed out, Trump was vulnerable too with massive debt, past money laundering, and history of working with Russian\u2019s against US interests, and campaign finance felonies. Trump, his family, and many members of his campaign may not be prosecuted for coordinating with the Russian election interferences that delegitimized the 2016 election. But they\u2019re far from being upright citizens unfairly accused of crimes that they benefitted from personally and financially. Worse than being mere career criminals, they are dupes for the Kremlin compromised by past crime and driven by destructive greed and they keep pressing themselves deeper into Vladimir Putin\u2019s willing arms.\nBarr and Rosenstein: A Bird\u2019s Eye View\nThe SCO exhausted their investigation regarding the narrow issues they were tasked to examine. Mueller\u2019s investigation determined that Russia did interfere with the election, that they did hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign as well as Democratic and Republican organizations. We know from public reporting that there was evidence of coordination but according to Barr\u2019s summary letter it proved insufficient to recommend prosecution. We\u2019ve examined reasons why that might be. We know Mueller found there was evidence of obstruction of justice but oddly made no recommendations. Barr testified that there was no plan to redact evidence related to obstruction. This is in keeping with his opinion that congress is the proper body to assess the presidents abuse of power rendering any claims that he\u2019s trying to keep this information from congress to protect trump moot. It also indicates he\u2019s less likely to look countenance the obstruction issue without underlying indictments. He also made likely made counter-intelligence findings which as mentioned above we know nothing about yet. We have yet to deal with one side criticism. Was Barr sufficiently forthcoming in his summary letter from the standpoint of Special Prosecutor Mueller or members of his team?\nTeam Mueller\u2019s pushback\nOn April 3rd, 2019 the New York Times reported that some on Mueller\u2019s team told their aides that Barr\u2019s summary did not adequately capture the gravity of Trump and his campaign\u2019s connections with Russia. The following day The Washington Post confirmed this reporting with their own details. Subsequently NBC has confirmed the report adding their own additional color. This has been framed as a shot across the bow aimed at Barr. That is a plausible read of it but overstated in a sense \u2013 as far as shots go this was more of a rubber band or sling shot than Naval artillery. The reports are hearsay within hearsay within hearsay. They have not been disputed publicly by anyone on Mueller\u2019s team but they are sourced to government officials with knowledge of what aides of some members of Mueller\u2019s team believe. The reports are certainly not coming from Mueller himself. So what are we to make of this?\nIs a preliminary matter Barr testified that he communicated with Mueller about the summary letter and that he asked if Mueller wanted to review it. Mueller declined. This undermines some of the criticism. Others have commented that these reports were meant as a low level or subtle caution to \u201cTrump and Company\u201d to let the entire lot of them know that Barr\u2019s actions look suspicious to a good many folks beyond the partisan pundits on the outside. These leaks let Barr know that if he\u2019s up to something bad he should reconsider. In another important way, these leaks actually help Barr. By putting the president and congressional Republican enablers on notice that he can\u2019t suppress any of their findings without making it near certain members of Mueller\u2019s team will testify to their findings publicly, the leaks give Barr ammunition to push back. If the president call in a rage demanding he keep evidence from congress, Barr can reply that if he tries it, it can be used as further evidence of obstruction at that members of Barr\u2019s team seem willing to testify to that before congress. Moreover, there is little the President nor the Department of Justice can do to stop those members who are no longer paid by the DOJ from testifying. These leaks give Barr leverage.\nA bird\u2019s eye view of the DOJ, the Constitution, and history\nThere is another aspect of these leaks that feels familiar to me as someone who was a government lawyer and Army Officer. The complaints read sound common, like complaints made by people working intensely in one area of a larger project that itself is part of an even larger project. Indeed because Mueller was given the opportunity to review the report and declined to do so it makes the team members complaining appear as though they did not see the entire picture. This is understandable and in a sense audible. In one\u2019s direct efforts, every piece of evidence can seem to be of ultimate import.\nUnder good leadership this leads to constructive confrontation where the lower echelon officer in charge of a section of the project argues with the next echelon trying to impress upon higher the gravity or importance of the work. There is even guidance for how to do this when rank is involved. Sometimes the lower echelon prevails, but often times decisions are made at high echelons based on information not directly available to the lower. That appears to be the case here. This pattern is true for junior and very senior experienced people. It\u2019s true in the civilian world as well as in the military. On a senior level these struggles are called a turf wars. The important take-away from this complaints is that irrespective of position these leaks demonstrate the alarm of parts of members of the team who have spent years of their lives working on this investigation but who may have been compartmented from other aspects of the DOJ and other Russia related investigations.\nThe emotions driving the leaks are legitimate. I don\u2019t want to downplay them. It\u2019s frustrating when one\u2019s boss who has a birds eye view of the situation takes a different approach than the one you\u2019ve prepared for. Deeply. It\u2019s worse when that direction may have political reasons or at least be perceived to have them. I know this from personal experience in areas of conflict. I also know from personal experience that differing views are not a matter of right or wrong but of practical judgment regarding future effects. Elections matter. Like it or not, in this situation Barr doesn\u2019t just have a bird\u2019s eye view of the current DOJ, he has a living view of the history of the DOJ during times of social upheaval, and a long view of the constitutional jurisprudence surrounding the separation of powers. One can agree or disagree with actions taken, but those are practical matters that do not touch Barr\u2019s intent. Personally I find his experience and commitment to the defense of the Constitution and of America comforting even if I ultimately end up frustrated with his judgment.\nThe DOJ\u2019s response.\nThe DOJ responded to these leaks pointing out that every page of the Special Counsel\u2019s report is marked as confidential. Louise Mensch points out that this response falls into a grey area. The summaries involved were done to only require minor redactions at most. And the response does not refer to the summaries but the report. She leaves Barr\u2019s intent as a questions mark and ultimately concludes (correctly I believe) that it doesn\u2019t matter. There is nothing Barr can do to prevent the evidence collected by Mueller\u2019s team from coming to light.\nBarr testified to two issues in regards to the summaries. First, that the letter was his responsibility and he was responsible for its content. Taking responsibility rather than blaming controversial actions on others is the mark of a good leader and profoundly anti-Trumpian. Second, he stated that he did not like summaries, that he did not intend that his letter be read as a summary, and that he tried as best as possible to use Mueller\u2019s own language with regards to the information he provided opting instead to wait for the full release of the report before engaging in questions about something that as former FBI agent and CNN contributor Josh Campbell repeatedly points out \u2013 no one has read yet.\nI would add that even summaries derived from low level classified information \u2013 information marked \u201cconfidential\u201d still have to be vetted. In some ways it\u2019s more difficult because the question as to when a paraphrase or summary contains classified information is not always easy to determine, particularly when there is more at risk than might be readily apparent to the investigators. I see nothing in the DOJ\u2019s response that indicates Barr is risking prison in what would be the stupidest cover up in US history. Still, highly lawyered words that obfuscate some of the underlying issues are probably not the best move politically and Mensch\u2019s concerns have basis.\nRepresentative Schiff and the shifting law of grand jury secrecy\nThere is no reason to doubt that Barr will release the Mueller report at this point. He stated during in testimony before congress that he would have a color coded redacted report with notes explaining the basis of the redaction within around a week. His statement was timely. The debate with regards to the report is now turning to redactions. Congress and the public in general rightly want to know what will or will not be redacted. This issue is serious but the analysis cuts more in favor of heavy redactions and Barr\u2019s intent to color code the redactions provides the information necessary for congress to request additional information from Barr or to fight for that information in court.\nThe DOJ indicated that Barr\u2019s team will redact classified information, grand jury material, information related to other ongoing cases, third party sensitive personal information, and potentially material subject to executive privilege. Barr stated that he has no intent to redact any material based on executive privilege. There is little debate with regards to the redaction of classified information, uninvolved third parties, and personal information. The fight right now is over material related to specific grand jury investigations both ongoing and those which may have resulted in sealed indictments or which did not find probably cause to prosecute.\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has argued that grand jury information should not be redacted. He basis his argument on the fact that during the Watergate investigation, petitioned the court for the release of grand jury material and the court granted that permission. He\u2019s slammed Barr over this demanding to know why he has not even requested that the court release any grand jury material.\nUnfortunately for the good representative\u2019s argument, others pointed to a case decided last week on appeal by a three judge panel in the DC circuit. Barr stated that he was bound by this decision. The case is history is summarized as follows:\nHistorian Stuart A. McKeever appeals an order of the district court denying his petition to release grand jury records from the 1957 indictment of a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which McKeever sought in the course of his research for a book he is writing. The district court, lacking positive authority, asserted it has inherent authority to disclose historically significant grand jury matters but denied McKeever\u2019s request as overbroad. On appeal, the Government argues the district court does not have the inherent authority it claims but rather is limited to the exceptions to grand jury secrecy listed in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e).\nThe opinion is split. The majority decision written by Senior Circuit Judge Ginsberg found that the DC District Court is bound by the specific enumerated exemptions to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure found under Rule 6(3)(3) relating to what can be released and that the district court did not have the authority to act outside of those specific exemptions. This at least temporarily limits the information that Barr could request from the court. Furthermore the case that was on appeal was not related to the Mueller report at all.\nJudge Ginsberg noted that the 7th circuit arrived at the opposite conclusion creating a split in the circuits which could allow the Supreme Court to step in and solve the issue. There are good reasons in the dissenting opinion to disagree with the majority here. However, the disagreement is beside the point with regards to Representative Schiff\u2019s concern. Unless and until the full DC circuit, or the Supreme Court overturns the decision of the panel, the opinion is binding on the DC District Court. Moreover this case was argued September 21, 2018 well before Barr was confirmed, and months before acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker was appointed to the position. Since then Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused from the investigation, the only one who had purview over both was Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein who has not contradicted Barr\u2019s position with regards to redactions.\nOutside of the precedent and limitations this decision places on DC District Court, The this case completely invalidates the argument that Barr\u2019s failure to seek Grand Jury information is further evidence that his intent to redact Grand Jury material was nefarious. One might argue that he should still petition for the release of the information at district courts in other jurisdictions. However action of this sort work be inequitable. It would not be fair or in the interest of justice to apply a different set of rules to different targets in ongoing grand jury proceeding related to the same core issues and possibly involving co-conspirators.\nMoreover providing Grand Jury information is limited for a variety of reasons. We want people to cooperate with Grand Juries. We do not want to prejudice ongoing cases with material that may be out of context. And we do not want to damage the reputations of individuals who may have been the subject of a Grand Jury proceeding but against whom the Grand Jury found no probable cause. Even here, the most damaging argument in favor of calling Barr a bad actor turns out to lack any basis. It was never a credible argument. Barr was in fact being a conscience actor following the rule of law as the DOJ had argued in the DC Circuit the entire time with regards to his intent to redact grand jury information in the Mueller report.\nConclusion: Is Barr a White Hat?\nYes. Barr is a white hat. It\u2019s OK to hate him. It\u2019s OK to criticize his views of the law and of politics. He may not be acting in the way those opposed to President Trump like at this present point in history, but he is acting within the rule of law, and he believes with solid legal justification that he\u2019s acting for the benefit of all Americans in the long term by seeking to protect the power granted by the Constitution to the executive branch of the federal government. Mueller had a statutory obligation to notify the Attorney General when he concluded his investigation. Similarly, Barr had a statutory obligation to notify congress. Barr has multiple ongoing investigations to protect and a president who often demonstrates his willingness to flaunt the rules and norms to keep in check while national security is at risk because other criminal activities under investigation could still be used by hostile foreign intelligence assets to compromise a Trump. Barr\u2019s letter to congress at a bare minimum had to simultaneously report to congress as required by law, assure the president to avoid a constitutional crisis level meltdown, and protect ongoing investigations for as long as possible. It did all three.\nLike many contested issues where there is ongoing troubling activity there were some negative consequences to Barr\u2019s letter that helped fuel concern over his actions. Trump at least temporarily was able to claim a win. His window of opportunity to make that claim credibly has already passed. Congress is scheduling Barr to testify. Representative Nadler on behalf of the House Judiciary Committee requested the full report by April 2, 2019. When it was not delivered by that time, the committee subsequently voted to authorize a subpoena for the full report of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation but as of this writing they have yet to issue the subpoena. The public will likely get a redacted copy of the report fairly soon. It\u2019s important to note that even in this state the report will be devastating for Trump and whatever redactions may exist will tell us quite a bit too.\nLikewise, Trump had a relatively short period of time to credibly attack journalists reporting his extra-official affairs and to try to pummel into submission the corporate organizations that provide those journalists with a platform and to shore up his base by trying to convince them that any new evidence that comes out is fake. His timeframe to successfully use this tactic in this regard too has passed. A reckoning is coming with regards to the multiple ongoing investigations particularly in the Southern District of New York and New York State \u2013 and this timeframe is reflected in his manic attempts to claim vindication.\nBarr has everything he needs to tell Trump to pound sand if asked to interfere with these investigations and little ability to do anything even if he wanted to. Moreover, he\u2019s already put his novel theory regarding obstruction into practice even if he claims he did not \u2013 and it may have been done to protect other prosecutions. As a result of his letter, Barr can now oversee those investigations in relative peace as Trump and his #MAGA supporters engage in their quixotic battle against the free press and the Democrats holding his administration in check. Finally, both Barr\u2019s letter notifying congress that he had received Mueller\u2019s report, and his summary report to congress already accomplished one very important thing. Those letters created near universal demand for the release of Mueller\u2019s report and ensured that every aspect of that report will be sought. By tailoring a narrow letter, by leaving so many questions, by drawing only one very conspicuous conclusion regarding obstruction, Barr gave a gift to journalists, pundits, Democrats, and the public: questions the public will demand answers to.\nWhile the process plays out, Trump will continue to use the opportunity to try to garner support and to play to the media. He will go on and on about it at upcoming rallies. But the more the president saber rattles, the more damning any future criminal indictments will be. We should remain vigilant and continue to apply political pressure to release the report. We should hold a healthy skepticism with regards to Barr\u2019s conduct. He\u2019s far too comfortable with expansive executive power and far too uncomfortable with the laws that hold an abusive unfit would be dictator in check. Yet I understand why he holds those beliefs. Moreover I believe his own deeply held political views require him to hand the investigative materials over to congress and provide as complete a report as possible to the American people. He believes congress and US voters are the proper place and have the proper power to prosecute an American president.\nEven if you disagree with all of my conclusions, or even if all of my conclusions are ultimately wrong, I would encourage everyone to wait for the redacted report and the ongoing prosecutions with other DOJ and state prosecutors to finish before attacking the DOJ and condemning the AG. To do so risks further diminution of the rule-of-law already in the middle of one of the biggest pressure tests since the United States Civil War. One of the lessons I took away from working closely with local national populations in Iraq and Afghanistan is that one has to act decently and give trust if one wants to get trust and decency in return.\nSo far the evidence suggests that Barr and the DOJ successfully protect federal law enforcement from the attacks of an angry president seeking to demean the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference with our elections by painting it as a partisan campaign against himself personally originated and conducted by \u201cAngry Democrats.\u201d Barr\u2019s notification letter went a long way towards rehabilitate the DOJ\u2019s image on the right just as his summary letter sought to distance the department from politics in order to preserve its legitimacy. He has protected the integrity of ongoing investigations, and in the end, protected America by giving the process and his prosecutors the space and peace needed to complete their investigations and to ensure that any crimes committed by the president and those close to him are brought to light and to justice while providing stability and the continued respect for rule of law. While he may appear to be wearing a black hat, sometimes good guys don\u2019t wear white.\nPatribotics is grateful to you for making this site possible.

Joaquin Castro's (D-Texas) resolution of disapproval were Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Mike Gallagher (Wis.), Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), Will Hurd (Texas), Dusty Johnson (S.D.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), Francis Rooney (Fla.), Jim Sensenbrenner (Wis.), Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), Fred Upton (Mich.), and Greg Walden (Ore.).</p>\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m 100% in favor of President Trump&rsquo;s wall, and today&rsquo;s vote had nothing to do with the need to build it. For the same reason I was against President Obama using his &lsquo;pen and phone,&rsquo; I voted to disapprove of this unilateral executive action,&quot; tweeted McMorris Rodgers.</p>\n<p>Once in the Senate, four Republican defectors would be needed to send the bill to President Trump's desk. Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) have said they will vote for it.</p>\n<p>Both chambers currently lack the majorities needed to override Trump's guaranteed veto pen.</p>\n<p>House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told reporters earlier in the day that &quot;the president's declaration is a phony, fraudulent, and fake national emergency.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;There is no crisis at the border. The president's actions are manufactured, manipulative, and represent a misappropriation of taxpayer resources inconsistent with the United States Constitution,&quot; Jeffries said.</p>\n<p>&quot;There is no crisis at our Southern border. There is no basis in law or in fact to declare a national emergency. There is no increase in illegal crossings that our border. There is no increase in criminal activity at our border. There is no increase in drug trafficking at our border,&quot; he continued. &quot;There is no evidence that terrorists are coming into the United States of America along our Southern border. President Donald Trump has more stories than Harry Potter and all of them are make-believe. That is why House Democrats are proceeding with a resolution of this approval with respect to this fake national emergency.&quot;</p>\n<p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) argued at a GOP leadership media availability that &quot;Democratic presidents have used this power because they have the right to use this power.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;A number of presidents, republican and Democrats, have used this power for numerous things. And they have the power to do it. Congress had voted to allow it,&quot; McCarthy said.</p>\n<p>Asked why Republicans didn't recognize the border as a national emergency a couple months ago when the party was still in control of the lower chamber, McCarthy replied that &quot;times change as it moves forward.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;When you get the more reports of the amount of drugs coming across, you get the more reports of the human trafficking and others, 60,000 people arrested each month. I think when you have the experts telling you the challenge -- I think the president tried to do everything in his power to work with the House and the Senate,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the president's belief was always that we could come to an agreement to solve this along what the experts have requested. I think at the end of the day the president has a responsibility to make sure it gets protected. And he made the decision.&quot;</p>\n<p>The small House Liberty Caucus, which includes libertarian-leaning Republicans, urged support for the resolution of disapproval because &quot;at the heart of the American constitutional system is the doctrine of separation of powers: Congress makes the laws; the president executes the laws; and the Supreme Court decides cases and controversies.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Few dispute the president&rsquo;s ability to act quickly to address a real emergency, but simply saying something is an emergency does not make it so and cannot on its own trigger emergency powers,&quot; said the caucus, led by Amash. &quot;Under our constitutional system, an emergency declaration permitting the president to take unilateral action is valid only in an actual emergency, which is necessarily limited to a situation in which immediate action is needed, Congress has no opportunity to act, and the president&rsquo;s proposed response can be accomplished quickly. If any of these is not true, it cannot be an emergency necessitating (or permitting) presidential action without the consent of Congress.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Rep.

                "text": "WASHINGTON -- The House voted 245-182 this evening, with 13 Republicans joining the majority Dems, to block President Trump's declaration of a national emergency to raid other appropriations for money to build a border wall.\nThe GOPs voting in favor of Rep. Joaquin Castro's (D-Texas) resolution of disapproval were Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Mike Gallagher (Wis.), Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), Will Hurd (Texas), Dusty Johnson (S.D.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), Francis Rooney (Fla.), Jim Sensenbrenner (Wis.), Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), Fred Upton (Mich.), and Greg Walden (Ore.).\n\"I\u2019m 100% in favor of President Trump\u2019s wall, and today\u2019s vote had nothing to do with the need to build it. For the same reason I was against President Obama using his \u2018pen and phone,\u2019 I voted to disapprove of this unilateral executive action,\" tweeted McMorris Rodgers.\nOnce in the Senate, four Republican defectors would be needed to send the bill to President Trump's desk. Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) have said they will vote for it.\nBoth chambers currently lack the majorities needed to override Trump's guaranteed veto pen.\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told reporters earlier in the day that \"the president's declaration is a phony, fraudulent, and fake national emergency.\"\n\"There is no crisis at the border. The president's actions are manufactured, manipulative, and represent a misappropriation of taxpayer resources inconsistent with the United States Constitution,\" Jeffries said.\n\"There is no crisis at our Southern border. There is no basis in law or in fact to declare a national emergency. There is no increase in illegal crossings that our border. There is no increase in criminal activity at our border. There is no increase in drug trafficking at our border,\" he continued. \"There is no evidence that terrorists are coming into the United States of America along our Southern border. President Donald Trump has more stories than Harry Potter and all of them are make-believe. That is why House Democrats are proceeding with a resolution of this approval with respect to this fake national emergency.\"\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) argued at a GOP leadership media availability that \"Democratic presidents have used this power because they have the right to use this power.\"\n\"A number of presidents, republican and Democrats, have used this power for numerous things. And they have the power to do it. Congress had voted to allow it,\" McCarthy said.\nAsked why Republicans didn't recognize the border as a national emergency a couple months ago when the party was still in control of the lower chamber, McCarthy replied that \"times change as it moves forward.\"\n\"When you get the more reports of the amount of drugs coming across, you get the more reports of the human trafficking and others, 60,000 people arrested each month. I think when you have the experts telling you the challenge -- I think the president tried to do everything in his power to work with the House and the Senate,\" he said. \"I think the president's belief was always that we could come to an agreement to solve this along what the experts have requested. I think at the end of the day the president has a responsibility to make sure it gets protected. And he made the decision.\"\nThe small House Liberty Caucus, which includes libertarian-leaning Republicans, urged support for the resolution of disapproval because \"at the heart of the American constitutional system is the doctrine of separation of powers: Congress makes the laws; the president executes the laws; and the Supreme Court decides cases and controversies.\"\n\"Few dispute the president\u2019s ability to act quickly to address a real emergency, but simply saying something is an emergency does not make it so and cannot on its own trigger emergency powers,\" said the caucus, led by Amash. \"Under our constitutional system, an emergency declaration permitting the president to take unilateral action is valid only in an actual emergency, which is necessarily limited to a situation in which immediate action is needed, Congress has no opportunity to act, and the president\u2019s proposed response can be accomplished quickly. If any of these is not true, it cannot be an emergency necessitating (or permitting) presidential action without the consent of Congress.\"\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.)",

That's why I -- that's important to you to look up here and look at the old adage that our moms taught us: Liar, liar, pants on fire. No one should ever listen to you and give you credit ability. It's sad,&quot; said Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.).</p>\n<p>Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) asked Cohen, &quot;What was the breaking point at which you decided to start telling the truth?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;There are several factors. Helsinki. Charlottesville. Watching the daily destruction of our civility to one another. Putting up silly things like this,&quot; Cohen replied.</p>\n<p>&quot;Really unbecoming of Congress,&quot; he continued, looking at the GOP side of the dais. &quot;It's that sort of behavior that I'm responsible for, I'm responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you're doing now for 10 years. I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years and the fact that you pull up a news article that has no value to it and you want to use that as the premise for discrediting me that I'm not the person that people called at 3 o'clock in the morning would make you inaccurate.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;In actuality it would make you a liar, which puts you into the same position that I am in, and I can only warn people the more people that follow Mr. Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen said he has made &quot;mistakes in life and I've owned them and I've taken responsibility for them and I'm paying a huge price as is my family, so if that in and of itself isn't enough to dissuade somebody from acting in the callous manner that I did, I'm not sure that that person has any chance very much like I'm in right now.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Everybody's job at the Trump organization is to protect Mr. Trump. Every day most of us knew we were coming in and we were going to lie for him on something and that became the norm,&quot; he said. &quot;And that's exactly what's happening right now in this country and it's exactly what's happening here in government.&quot;</p>\n<p>The hearing is expected to continue to at least late into the afternoon.</p>",

That's why I -- that's important to you to look up here and look at the old adage that our moms taught us: Liar, liar, pants on fire. No one should ever listen to you and give you credit ability. It's sad,\" said Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.).\nRep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) asked Cohen, \"What was the breaking point at which you decided to start telling the truth?\"\n\"There are several factors. Helsinki. Charlottesville. Watching the daily destruction of our civility to one another. Putting up silly things like this,\" Cohen replied.\n\"Really unbecoming of Congress,\" he continued, looking at the GOP side of the dais. \"It's that sort of behavior that I'm responsible for, I'm responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you're doing now for 10 years. I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years and the fact that you pull up a news article that has no value to it and you want to use that as the premise for discrediting me that I'm not the person that people called at 3 o'clock in the morning would make you inaccurate.\"\n\"In actuality it would make you a liar, which puts you into the same position that I am in, and I can only warn people the more people that follow Mr. Trump as I did blindly are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering.\"\nCohen said he has made \"mistakes in life and I've owned them and I've taken responsibility for them and I'm paying a huge price as is my family, so if that in and of itself isn't enough to dissuade somebody from acting in the callous manner that I did, I'm not sure that that person has any chance very much like I'm in right now.\"\n\"Everybody's job at the Trump organization is to protect Mr. Trump. Every day most of us knew we were coming in and we were going to lie for him on something and that became the norm,\" he said. \"And that's exactly what's happening right now in this country and it's exactly what's happening here in government.\"\nThe hearing is expected to continue to at least late into the afternoon.",

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>WASHINGTON -- Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen will tell Congress on Wednesday that he has lied, &quot;but I am not a liar,&quot; and has fixed things, &quot;but I am no longer your 'fixer,' Mr. Trump.&quot;</p>\n<p>According to prepared testimony released late this evening, Cohen plans to tell the House Oversight and Reform Committee in his highly anticipated public hearing that he &quot;never heard Mr. Trump say anything in private that led me to believe he loved our nation or wanted to make it better -- in fact, he did the opposite.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I recognize that some of you may doubt and attack me on my credibility. It is for this reason that I have incorporated into this opening statement documents that are irrefutable, and demonstrate that the information you will hear is accurate and truthful,&quot; said Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, tax fraud, bank fraud, and previously lying to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow and is spending three days on Capitol Hill testifying before reporting for a three-year prison sentence on May 6.</p>\n<p>Documents submitted with Cohen's testimony include a copy of a check paid from Trump after becoming president to Cohen as a reimbursement for hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels (Cohen says &quot;lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets&quot;), copies of Trump's financial statements spanning 2011-13 that had been used to inquire about a Deutsche Bank loan to buy <em>Forbes</em> and the Buffalo Bills, and &quot;copies of letters I wrote at Mr. Trump&rsquo;s direction that threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Never in a million years did I imagine, when I accepted a job in 2007 to work for Donald Trump, that he would one day run for president, launch a campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance, and actually win,&quot; he added. &quot;I regret the day I said 'yes' to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen rattles off reasons for which he is ashamed, concluding with: &quot;I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen charges that, as a presidential candidate, Trump &quot;knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails.&quot;</p>\n<p>He apologized to lawmakers for previously lying to Congress, saying that &quot;last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr. Trump&quot; but &quot;today, I&rsquo;m here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump.&quot; He said Trump's lawyers &quot;reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That&rsquo;s not how he operates. In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there&rsquo;s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie,&quot; continues Cohen's testimony, adding that Trump inquired about the status of the project multiple times during 2016 and that &quot;he lied about it because he never expected to win the election.&quot;</p>\n<p>Delving into his views on his former employer, Cohen said Trump's &quot;bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal,&quot; Cohen's testimony says. &quot;Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation &ndash; only to market himself and to build his wealth and power. Mr. Trump would often say this campaign was going to be the 'greatest infomercial in political history.' He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign &ndash; for him &ndash; was always a marketing opportunity.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen said that in July 2016, days before the Democratic National Convention, he was in Trump's office when Stone called and was put on speakerphone. He said Stone advised Trump that he had spoken with Assange and was assured that &quot;within a couple of days there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of 'wouldn&rsquo;t that be great,'&quot; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>His testimony elaborates on claims that Trump is racist.</p>\n<p>&quot;The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries 'shitholes.' In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn&rsquo;t a 'shithole.' This was when Barack Obama was president of the United States,&quot; Cohen said. &quot;While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;And it should come as no surprise that one of my more common responsibilities was that Mr. Trump directed me to call business owners, many of whom were small businesses, that were owed money for their services and told them no payment or a reduced payment would be coming,&quot; he continued. &quot;When I advised Mr. Trump of my success, he actually reveled in it. And yet, I continued to work for him.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen also will publicly give a nod to Trump's current trip in Vietnam -- where the president will likely watch his former fixer's testimony on a 12-hour time difference -- by saying Trump asked him to &quot;handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment,&quot; he said. &quot;He finished the conversation with the following comment. 'You think I&rsquo;m stupid, I wasn&rsquo;t going to Vietnam.' I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen said he doesn't have &quot;direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia&quot; but &quot;I have my suspicions.&quot; He noted an interaction between Donald Trump Jr. and his father discussing an upcoming meeting &quot;probably in early June 2016&quot; that he now believes &quot;was referring to <em>that</em> June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representative.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen adds in his testimony that he has &quot;never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump&quot; and said Trump calling him a &ldquo;'rat' for choosing to tell the truth&quot; is &quot;much like a mobster would do when one of his men decides to cooperate with the government.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I am not a perfect man. I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life,&quot; he said. &quot;But today, I get to decide the example I set for my children and how I attempt to change how history will remember me. I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people here today.&quot;</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON -- Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen will tell Congress on Wednesday that he has lied, \"but I am not a liar,\" and has fixed things, \"but I am no longer your 'fixer,' Mr. Trump.\"\nAccording to prepared testimony released late this evening, Cohen plans to tell the House Oversight and Reform Committee in his highly anticipated public hearing that he \"never heard Mr. Trump say anything in private that led me to believe he loved our nation or wanted to make it better -- in fact, he did the opposite.\"\n\"I recognize that some of you may doubt and attack me on my credibility. It is for this reason that I have incorporated into this opening statement documents that are irrefutable, and demonstrate that the information you will hear is accurate and truthful,\" said Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, tax fraud, bank fraud, and previously lying to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow and is spending three days on Capitol Hill testifying before reporting for a three-year prison sentence on May 6.\nDocuments submitted with Cohen's testimony include a copy of a check paid from Trump after becoming president to Cohen as a reimbursement for hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels (Cohen says \"lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets\"), copies of Trump's financial statements spanning 2011-13 that had been used to inquire about a Deutsche Bank loan to buy Forbes and the Buffalo Bills, and \"copies of letters I wrote at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction that threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores.\"\n\"Never in a million years did I imagine, when I accepted a job in 2007 to work for Donald Trump, that he would one day run for president, launch a campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance, and actually win,\" he added. \"I regret the day I said 'yes' to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way.\"\nCohen rattles off reasons for which he is ashamed, concluding with: \"I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.\"\nCohen charges that, as a presidential candidate, Trump \"knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails.\"\nHe apologized to lawmakers for previously lying to Congress, saying that \"last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr. Trump\" but \"today, I\u2019m here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump.\" He said Trump's lawyers \"reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it.\"\n\"Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates. In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there\u2019s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie,\" continues Cohen's testimony, adding that Trump inquired about the status of the project multiple times during 2016 and that \"he lied about it because he never expected to win the election.\"\nDelving into his views on his former employer, Cohen said Trump's \"bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself.\"\n\"He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal,\" Cohen's testimony says. \"Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation \u2013 only to market himself and to build his wealth and power. Mr. Trump would often say this campaign was going to be the 'greatest infomercial in political history.' He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign \u2013 for him \u2013 was always a marketing opportunity.\"\n\"A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes.\"\nCohen said that in July 2016, days before the Democratic National Convention, he was in Trump's office when Stone called and was put on speakerphone. He said Stone advised Trump that he had spoken with Assange and was assured that \"within a couple of days there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\"\n\"Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of 'wouldn\u2019t that be great,'\" Cohen said.\nHis testimony elaborates on claims that Trump is racist.\n\"The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries 'shitholes.' In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn\u2019t a 'shithole.' This was when Barack Obama was president of the United States,\" Cohen said. \"While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him.\"\n\"And it should come as no surprise that one of my more common responsibilities was that Mr. Trump directed me to call business owners, many of whom were small businesses, that were owed money for their services and told them no payment or a reduced payment would be coming,\" he continued. \"When I advised Mr. Trump of my success, he actually reveled in it. And yet, I continued to work for him.\"\nCohen also will publicly give a nod to Trump's current trip in Vietnam -- where the president will likely watch his former fixer's testimony on a 12-hour time difference -- by saying Trump asked him to \"handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft.\"\n\"Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment,\" he said. \"He finished the conversation with the following comment. 'You think I\u2019m stupid, I wasn\u2019t going to Vietnam.' I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now.\"\nCohen said he doesn't have \"direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia\" but \"I have my suspicions.\" He noted an interaction between Donald Trump Jr. and his father discussing an upcoming meeting \"probably in early June 2016\" that he now believes \"was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representative.\"\nCohen adds in his testimony that he has \"never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump\" and said Trump calling him a \u201c'rat' for choosing to tell the truth\" is \"much like a mobster would do when one of his men decides to cooperate with the government.\"\n\"I am not a perfect man. I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life,\" he said. \"But today, I get to decide the example I set for my children and how I attempt to change how history will remember me. I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people here today.\"",

(Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) (CQ Roll Call via AP Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I have no doubt that some theatrical director specializing in the work of Samuel Beckett has been eying the investigation of Robert Mueller with envy. After all, what the nation calls &ldquo;Waiting for Mueller&rdquo; has been running nearly two years and, just as in the famous Beckett absurdity, the title character never shows up. We&rsquo;re told that may be coming to an end, that finally, at last, Mueller really will deliver the goods, as soon as next week, CNN reported. But then it was CNN that reported it, so of course it turned out not to be true but just another installment of its fake news machine. Still, soon, soon, he&rsquo;ll be wrapping up &ldquo;soon,&rdquo; just as he was last spring, this past summer, and all through the fall. He&rsquo;s shedding lawyers, he&rsquo;s wrapping up, he&rsquo;ll be done ... soon.</p>\n<p>Well, sooner or later, he will be done soon, and then he really will be done. Maybe Donald Trump will have served out the whole of his first term by then, or maybe he will just be entering the 2020 election cycle when Mueller and his team of Clinton-Obama prosecutors turn off the lights and slide their report over the transom to Attorney General William Barr. We just don&rsquo;t know.</p>\n<p>But here&rsquo;s something we do know. While the nation&rsquo;s eyes have been riveted on the Mueller Russian Collusion investigation, its father, the Clinton Email investigation, has been quietly swept under the rug, pushed into the oubliette, stricken from the public&rsquo;s consciousness.</p>\n<p>In part it is a function of rhetoric. &ldquo;Russian Collusion&rdquo; sounds serious, especially since the Great Russian Reset, supposedly delivered by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has itself been reset and we are now watching reruns of McCarthy-era Red Menace movies. &ldquo;What if Donald Trump is Putin&rsquo;s stooge/puppet/poodle/mole/Manchurian candidate?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the sort of question Mad Max Boot asks everyday before breakfast, even though the president in 2016, when the alleged Russian Collusion was taking place, was B. Obama, the director of the CIA was the Gus Hall-voting John Brennan, and the director of National Intelligence was James Clapper.</p>\n<p>But if &ldquo;Russian Collusion&rdquo; sounds, or at least can be made to sound, scary, &ldquo;email server&rdquo; is, let&rsquo;s face it, boring. Try it out on your friends: &ldquo;Hillary Clinton used Gmail to send and receive emails.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, so let&rsquo;s say she did. What&rsquo;s the big deal?&rdquo; The dog won&rsquo;t hunt.</p>\n<p>In fact, though, it is a very big deal, so big that the Department of Justice itself, beginning with then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, made the decision that Clinton was not to be prosecuted unless and until an unavoidable case against her was staring them all in the face. So she ran a private, unsecured server from her home. So there were tons of classified and at least a couple dozen top secret documents passing through that cyber highway. Did she <i>intend</i> to compromise national security by acting cavalierly with her government&rsquo;s secrets?</p>\n<p>As was pointed out exhaustively at the time, &ldquo;gross negligence&rdquo; does not require intent to be actionable -- that&rsquo;s part of what makes the negligence gross: you don&rsquo;t have to <i>intend</i> to do it, you just don&rsquo;t take required precautions. The <i>Confiteor</i> covers this under the category of a <i>peccatum omissione </i>as distinct from a <i>peccatum opere. </i></p>\n<p>A lot of legal cogitation, not to mention political calculation, went into devising a strategy to keep Hillary Clinton off that hook, and the people doing the cogitating and calculating were in the Department of Justice. &ldquo;Make <i>intent </i>central, even though negligence does not require intent, and you are scot-free.&rdquo; That was the gambit. And it was that calculation that led those advising now-disgraced former FBI James Comey to strike the phrase &ldquo;gross negligence&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;extremely careless&rdquo; in its stead. Thus when, on July 5, 2016, Comey issued his famous <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system\">declaration</a> of <i>nolle posequi</i>, he could actually say, with a straight face, that &ldquo;our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Would a <i>reasonable prosecutor</i> bring a case against Michael Flynn for the sin of having been set up by the FBI?</p>\n<p>Shut up. We&rsquo;re not following that line of questioning just now, thank you very much.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, such questions do have a tendency to nag, and Jeff Carlson at <em>The Epoch Times</em> lays out some of the details of why they nag. If the media hadn&rsquo;t invested heavily in the Midas News Muffler Corporation, his essay &ldquo; <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/exclusive-doj-prevented-fbi-from-pursuing-gross-negligence-charges-against-clinton_2815097.html\">DOJ Prevented FBI From Pursuing Gross Negligence Charges Against Clinton</a>&rdquo; would rightly be considered explosive. Given the hear-no-evil-about-Obama-or-Hillary environment, however, it is merely revelatory. &ldquo;Early in the Hillary Clinton email case,&rdquo; Carlson reports, &ldquo;the Justice Department (DOJ), under then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, decided to set an unusually high threshold for prosecution of Clinton, effectively ensuring from the outset that she would not be charged.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What follows is a meticulously reported story in which &quot;i&rsquo;s&quot; are dotted, &quot;t's&quot; crossed, and the deeply inequitable actions of the Department of Justice and the FBI are anatomized for all to see. Chiseled on to the pediment of the Supreme Court is the legend &ldquo;Equal Justice Under Law.&rdquo; Both the long-running &ldquo;Waiting for Mueller&rdquo; show and will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp early-closing production of &quot;Hillary Stands Trial&quot; remind us that, in the United States <i>circa </i>2019, that statement not only is not true, it isn't even aspirational.</p>",

                "text": "I have no doubt that some theatrical director specializing in the work of Samuel Beckett has been eying the investigation of Robert Mueller with envy. After all, what the nation calls \u201cWaiting for Mueller\u201d has been running nearly two years and, just as in the famous Beckett absurdity, the title character never shows up. We\u2019re told that may be coming to an end, that finally, at last, Mueller really will deliver the goods, as soon as next week, CNN reported. But then it was CNN that reported it, so of course it turned out not to be true but just another installment of its fake news machine. Still, soon, soon, he\u2019ll be wrapping up \u201csoon,\u201d just as he was last spring, this past summer, and all through the fall. He\u2019s shedding lawyers, he\u2019s wrapping up, he\u2019ll be done ... soon.\nWell, sooner or later, he will be done soon, and then he really will be done. Maybe Donald Trump will have served out the whole of his first term by then, or maybe he will just be entering the 2020 election cycle when Mueller and his team of Clinton-Obama prosecutors turn off the lights and slide their report over the transom to Attorney General William Barr. We just don\u2019t know.\nBut here\u2019s something we do know. While the nation\u2019s eyes have been riveted on the Mueller Russian Collusion investigation, its father, the Clinton Email investigation, has been quietly swept under the rug, pushed into the oubliette, stricken from the public\u2019s consciousness.\nIn part it is a function of rhetoric. \u201cRussian Collusion\u201d sounds serious, especially since the Great Russian Reset, supposedly delivered by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has itself been reset and we are now watching reruns of McCarthy-era Red Menace movies. \u201cWhat if Donald Trump is Putin\u2019s stooge/puppet/poodle/mole/Manchurian candidate?\u201d That\u2019s the sort of question Mad Max Boot asks everyday before breakfast, even though the president in 2016, when the alleged Russian Collusion was taking place, was B. Obama, the director of the CIA was the Gus Hall-voting John Brennan, and the director of National Intelligence was James Clapper.\nBut if \u201cRussian Collusion\u201d sounds, or at least can be made to sound, scary, \u201cemail server\u201d is, let\u2019s face it, boring. Try it out on your friends: \u201cHillary Clinton used Gmail to send and receive emails.\u201d \u201cYeah, so let\u2019s say she did. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d The dog won\u2019t hunt.\nIn fact, though, it is a very big deal, so big that the Department of Justice itself, beginning with then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, made the decision that Clinton was not to be prosecuted unless and until an unavoidable case against her was staring them all in the face. So she ran a private, unsecured server from her home. So there were tons of classified and at least a couple dozen top secret documents passing through that cyber highway. Did she intend to compromise national security by acting cavalierly with her government\u2019s secrets?\nAs was pointed out exhaustively at the time, \u201cgross negligence\u201d does not require intent to be actionable -- that\u2019s part of what makes the negligence gross: you don\u2019t have to intend to do it, you just don\u2019t take required precautions. The Confiteor covers this under the category of a peccatum omissione as distinct from a peccatum opere.\nA lot of legal cogitation, not to mention political calculation, went into devising a strategy to keep Hillary Clinton off that hook, and the people doing the cogitating and calculating were in the Department of Justice. \u201cMake intent central, even though negligence does not require intent, and you are scot-free.\u201d That was the gambit. And it was that calculation that led those advising now-disgraced former FBI James Comey to strike the phrase \u201cgross negligence\u201d and insert \u201cextremely careless\u201d in its stead. Thus when, on July 5, 2016, Comey issued his famous declaration of nolle posequi, he could actually say, with a straight face, that \u201cour judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\u201d\nWould a reasonable prosecutor bring a case against Michael Flynn for the sin of having been set up by the FBI?\nShut up. We\u2019re not following that line of questioning just now, thank you very much.\nNevertheless, such questions do have a tendency to nag, and Jeff Carlson at The Epoch Times lays out some of the details of why they nag. If the media hadn\u2019t invested heavily in the Midas News Muffler Corporation, his essay \u201c DOJ Prevented FBI From Pursuing Gross Negligence Charges Against Clinton\u201d would rightly be considered explosive. Given the hear-no-evil-about-Obama-or-Hillary environment, however, it is merely revelatory. \u201cEarly in the Hillary Clinton email case,\u201d Carlson reports, \u201cthe Justice Department (DOJ), under then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, decided to set an unusually high threshold for prosecution of Clinton, effectively ensuring from the outset that she would not be charged.\u201d\nWhat follows is a meticulously reported story in which \"i\u2019s\" are dotted, \"t's\" crossed, and the deeply inequitable actions of the Department of Justice and the FBI are anatomized for all to see. Chiseled on to the pediment of the Supreme Court is the legend \u201cEqual Justice Under Law.\u201d Both the long-running \u201cWaiting for Mueller\u201d show and will-o\u2019-the-wisp early-closing production of \"Hillary Stands Trial\" remind us that, in the United States circa 2019, that statement not only is not true, it isn't even aspirational.",

Photo credit Johnny Walker.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Update below.</strong></p>\n<p>In a PJ Media exclusive, the Iraqi native turned Navy SEAL interpreter and bestselling author who goes by the code name &quot;Johnny Walker&quot; told his story and made a huge announcement: he will receive his U.S. citizenship on Wednesday morning! At that time, he will also reveal his real name. (This article will be updated with that name when it becomes public.)</p>\n<p>&quot;It's a big honor,&quot; Walker told PJ Media. He is looking forward to posting videos of the ceremony and predicted a beautiful moment where &quot;people from different backgrounds and different religions&quot; will be united by loyalty to the United States.</p>\n<p>Walker was born and grew up in Iraq and he started working with the U.S. military after the invasion began in 2003. He worked as an interpreter &mdash; called a &quot;terp&quot; &mdash; until 2009. That year, the military finally cleared him and his family to come to America.</p>\n<p>While he lived in Iraq, he kept his work for the U.S. military a secret. If he had been exposed, it could have cost him his life. Since he will receive his citizenship Wednesday, however, Walker and his family will finally be safe, so he can go public with his name. (The Johnny Walker code name came from the Iraqi-American's love for Johnnie Walker whiskey.)</p>\n<p>In 2014, Johnny Walker released a bestselling book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Code-Name-Johnny-Extraordinary-Everything/dp/B01L9H4URG/pjmedia-20\"><em>Code Name: Johnny Walker: The Extraordinary Story of the Iraqi Who Risked Everything to Fight with the U.S. Navy SEALs</em></a>.</p>\n<p>In his interview with PJ Media on Tuesday, Walker explained how the American dream entered his imagination. When he was a kid, his parents encouraged him to play basketball to let out some of his youthful energy. &quot;I started to love it,&quot; Walker told PJ Media. &quot;I started watching the Harlem team [the Globetrotters], listened to Country music, watched John Wayne movies.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;It gave me the American dream in my mind, built it in my imagination,&quot; the Iraqi-American said. When the U.S. military came to Iraq in 2003, he saw Americans as a liberating force.</p>\n<p>&quot;The SEALS were targeting bad guys in my city I didn't know about. They came thousands of miles to clean my city and I was born in this city,&quot; Walker told PJ Media. &quot;I was disappointed in myself.&quot;</p>\n<p>He suggested he didn't take sides. &quot;I didn't support American or Iraqi or anyone, I supported the good side versus the bad side,&quot; the Iraqi-American said. He saw the damage Al Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS) left behind. &quot;They will destroy us. They are the enemy of human beings.&quot;</p>\n<p>Walker told PJ Media he saw signs of ISIS even before Americans arrived in 2003. As the U.S. military fought insurgents, he saw the moral differences between the terrorists and what he saw as the forces of civilization.</p>\n<p>&quot;When we caught the bad guys and I saw the weapons &mdash; the C-4, the dynamite, the RPGs &mdash; all of it is against humanity, there is no future beyond it,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>Walker recalled a conversation with a captured terrorist.</p>\n<p>&quot;I asked him, 'Why are you doing that? The Americans can help us to be like Germany and Japan.' He had no answer besides, 'We have to kill them and everyone like them.' Killing is not how you build a nation. Civilization collapsed because of savagery and killing,&quot; he told PJ Media.</p>\n<p>When a terrorist is &quot;so savage he wants to kill kids, the human being in you is going to push you to do the right thing to protect kids.&quot; Al Qaeda, ISIS, and the insurgents do not represent Islam in his mind &mdash; they represent evil.</p>\n<p>Johnny Walker doesn't see his support for the Americans as a betrayal of his country or its people.</p>\n<p>&quot;Navy SEALS fought for the right reason, to free these people from dictators,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not against my people. Al Qaeda and ISIS are not f**king my people. They're savages. They want nothing.&quot; He said it would be absurd for someone to demand that a white man support the mosque shooter because he is white. &quot;Why do you not support your people?&quot; Walker jokingly asked.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-shattuck-7a417038/\">John Shattuck</a>, a former Navy airman and president of the real estate firm Advanced Appraising, told PJ Media he helped &quot;Johnny Walker&quot; finally get his citizenship. In fact, he said, &quot;Johnny Walker introduced me to Keith Barry.&quot;</p>\n<p>Last September, <a href=\"https://world.wng.org/2019/03/false_convictions_ruined_lives\">Navy SEAL Keith Barry</a> was finally acquitted after serving years in the Naval Consolidated Brig (a military prison) for being falsely convicted in a rape case. Shattuck had wanted to meet Walker for some time, and it was a fascinating coincidence that he met Barry at the same time.</p>\n<p>Shattuck described Walker as a true American hero. &quot;He's a guy that would give his life for any guy on the team. He would love to be a citizen, but he was focusing on his family more than himself,&quot; Shattuck said. He also said Walker was an unusual &quot;terp,&quot; because he knew how to handle a firearm.</p>\n<p>Shattuck has done some hostage negotiation work and he is well connected, so he decided to do what he could to get this Iraqi-American hero his long-denied citizenship.</p>\n<p>&quot;I do not have a law background. What I have is a south-side Chicago common sense background,&quot; he told PJ Media. &quot;I got the right people to listen. That's all I ever do.&quot; Shattuck also said he also helped Keith Barry overturn his conviction. He also helped <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/american-prisoner-released-in-haiti.html\">free Americans from prison</a> in Haiti.</p>\n<p>Shattuck told Walker not to worry but to compile his paperwork. &quot;Lots of folks were attesting to his character &mdash; it's incredible what was in there,&quot; he said. &quot;I took his paperwork to the Pentagon, I got it to the right people.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;If you think about a Johnny Walker that has been vetted to the Nth degree &mdash; you know who he is. How much more do you need to vet him?&quot; Shattuck asked. He also noted that the Iraqi-American &quot;could never go back to Iraq, because if he did, they would kill him.</p>\n<p>In his interview with PJ Media, &quot;Johnny Walker&quot; freely called Iraq a &quot;sh*thole country,&quot; but expressed love for the people. &quot;Iraq needs a new government,&quot; Walker said. &quot;The people in Iraq, they are amazing. But they have no option but to live under dictators or corrupt government.&quot;</p>\n<p>He also lamented the unnecessary divisions between Sunni and Shia Muslims. They coexist in his own family!</p>\n<p>&quot;I am Sunni, she is Shia,&quot; he said of his wife. &quot;We get married and after 6, 7, 8 years I told her, can I talk with my kids? I need to ask them something specific. I told them, 'Hey guys, we can have a vote: who's going to be Sunni and who's going to be Shia?'&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;If I have Allah, the Quran, and Mohammed, why do I worry about any other sources?&quot; Walker asked. &quot;After that is just a political agenda. I consider that bulls**t.&quot;</p>\n<p>But that political bulls**t continues to wreak havoc on the Middle East. &quot;Right now, Iran destroyed all the countries around her because they want to export Islamic Revolution to those countries,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>This Iraqi-American had a few political ideas as well. He is a big fan of President Donald Trump's wall.</p>\n<p>&quot;The wall, it's something personal. I don't want to have AK-47s every time I take my kids to school,&quot; Walker told PJ Media. &quot;I'm not against immigrants, there are thousands better than me. But I am against people who have no background check, who are smuggling across the border. We don't know whether those guys have a criminal record or not, all we know is that they use kids to get what they want.&quot;</p>\n<p>Both Shattuck and Johnny Walker agreed that foreign interpreters who risk their lives in helping the U.S. military should have a fast-track to citizenship.</p>\n<p>&quot;For me and a lot of people who worked with Americans, fought with Americans, want the American dream &mdash; I think America should give them something special,&quot; Walker told PJ Media.</p>\n<p><strong>Update March 20 at 12:36 p.m.: </strong>Johnny Walker got his citizenship this morning! And his real name is Riyadh Ahmed Khalaf Al Ahmady. He goes by &quot;Riyadh.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Follow Tyler O'Neil, the author of this article, on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tyler2ONeil\">@Tyler2ONeil</a>.</strong></p>",

                "text": "Update below.\nIn a PJ Media exclusive, the Iraqi native turned Navy SEAL interpreter and bestselling author who goes by the code name \"Johnny Walker\" told his story and made a huge announcement: he will receive his U.S. citizenship on Wednesday morning! At that time, he will also reveal his real name. (This article will be updated with that name when it becomes public.)\n\"It's a big honor,\" Walker told PJ Media. He is looking forward to posting videos of the ceremony and predicted a beautiful moment where \"people from different backgrounds and different religions\" will be united by loyalty to the United States.\nWalker was born and grew up in Iraq and he started working with the U.S. military after the invasion began in 2003. He worked as an interpreter \u2014 called a \"terp\" \u2014 until 2009. That year, the military finally cleared him and his family to come to America.\nWhile he lived in Iraq, he kept his work for the U.S. military a secret. If he had been exposed, it could have cost him his life. Since he will receive his citizenship Wednesday, however, Walker and his family will finally be safe, so he can go public with his name. (The Johnny Walker code name came from the Iraqi-American's love for Johnnie Walker whiskey.)\nIn 2014, Johnny Walker released a bestselling book, Code Name: Johnny Walker: The Extraordinary Story of the Iraqi Who Risked Everything to Fight with the U.S. Navy SEALs.\nIn his interview with PJ Media on Tuesday, Walker explained how the American dream entered his imagination. When he was a kid, his parents encouraged him to play basketball to let out some of his youthful energy. \"I started to love it,\" Walker told PJ Media. \"I started watching the Harlem team [the Globetrotters], listened to Country music, watched John Wayne movies.\"\n\"It gave me the American dream in my mind, built it in my imagination,\" the Iraqi-American said. When the U.S. military came to Iraq in 2003, he saw Americans as a liberating force.\n\"The SEALS were targeting bad guys in my city I didn't know about. They came thousands of miles to clean my city and I was born in this city,\" Walker told PJ Media. \"I was disappointed in myself.\"\nHe suggested he didn't take sides. \"I didn't support American or Iraqi or anyone, I supported the good side versus the bad side,\" the Iraqi-American said. He saw the damage Al Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS) left behind. \"They will destroy us. They are the enemy of human beings.\"\nWalker told PJ Media he saw signs of ISIS even before Americans arrived in 2003. As the U.S. military fought insurgents, he saw the moral differences between the terrorists and what he saw as the forces of civilization.\n\"When we caught the bad guys and I saw the weapons \u2014 the C-4, the dynamite, the RPGs \u2014 all of it is against humanity, there is no future beyond it,\" he said.\nWalker recalled a conversation with a captured terrorist.\n\"I asked him, 'Why are you doing that? The Americans can help us to be like Germany and Japan.' He had no answer besides, 'We have to kill them and everyone like them.' Killing is not how you build a nation. Civilization collapsed because of savagery and killing,\" he told PJ Media.\nWhen a terrorist is \"so savage he wants to kill kids, the human being in you is going to push you to do the right thing to protect kids.\" Al Qaeda, ISIS, and the insurgents do not represent Islam in his mind \u2014 they represent evil.\nJohnny Walker doesn't see his support for the Americans as a betrayal of his country or its people.\n\"Navy SEALS fought for the right reason, to free these people from dictators,\" he said. \"I'm not against my people. Al Qaeda and ISIS are not f**king my people. They're savages. They want nothing.\" He said it would be absurd for someone to demand that a white man support the mosque shooter because he is white. \"Why do you not support your people?\" Walker jokingly asked.\nJohn Shattuck, a former Navy airman and president of the real estate firm Advanced Appraising, told PJ Media he helped \"Johnny Walker\" finally get his citizenship. In fact, he said, \"Johnny Walker introduced me to Keith Barry.\"\nLast September, Navy SEAL Keith Barry was finally acquitted after serving years in the Naval Consolidated Brig (a military prison) for being falsely convicted in a rape case. Shattuck had wanted to meet Walker for some time, and it was a fascinating coincidence that he met Barry at the same time.\nShattuck described Walker as a true American hero. \"He's a guy that would give his life for any guy on the team. He would love to be a citizen, but he was focusing on his family more than himself,\" Shattuck said. He also said Walker was an unusual \"terp,\" because he knew how to handle a firearm.\nShattuck has done some hostage negotiation work and he is well connected, so he decided to do what he could to get this Iraqi-American hero his long-denied citizenship.\n\"I do not have a law background. What I have is a south-side Chicago common sense background,\" he told PJ Media. \"I got the right people to listen. That's all I ever do.\" Shattuck also said he also helped Keith Barry overturn his conviction. He also helped free Americans from prison in Haiti.\nShattuck told Walker not to worry but to compile his paperwork. \"Lots of folks were attesting to his character \u2014 it's incredible what was in there,\" he said. \"I took his paperwork to the Pentagon, I got it to the right people.\"\n\"If you think about a Johnny Walker that has been vetted to the Nth degree \u2014 you know who he is. How much more do you need to vet him?\" Shattuck asked. He also noted that the Iraqi-American \"could never go back to Iraq, because if he did, they would kill him.\nIn his interview with PJ Media, \"Johnny Walker\" freely called Iraq a \"sh*thole country,\" but expressed love for the people. \"Iraq needs a new government,\" Walker said. \"The people in Iraq, they are amazing. But they have no option but to live under dictators or corrupt government.\"\nHe also lamented the unnecessary divisions between Sunni and Shia Muslims. They coexist in his own family!\n\"I am Sunni, she is Shia,\" he said of his wife. \"We get married and after 6, 7, 8 years I told her, can I talk with my kids? I need to ask them something specific. I told them, 'Hey guys, we can have a vote: who's going to be Sunni and who's going to be Shia?'\"\n\"If I have Allah, the Quran, and Mohammed, why do I worry about any other sources?\" Walker asked. \"After that is just a political agenda. I consider that bulls**t.\"\nBut that political bulls**t continues to wreak havoc on the Middle East. \"Right now, Iran destroyed all the countries around her because they want to export Islamic Revolution to those countries,\" he said.\nThis Iraqi-American had a few political ideas as well. He is a big fan of President Donald Trump's wall.\n\"The wall, it's something personal. I don't want to have AK-47s every time I take my kids to school,\" Walker told PJ Media. \"I'm not against immigrants, there are thousands better than me. But I am against people who have no background check, who are smuggling across the border. We don't know whether those guys have a criminal record or not, all we know is that they use kids to get what they want.\"\nBoth Shattuck and Johnny Walker agreed that foreign interpreters who risk their lives in helping the U.S. military should have a fast-track to citizenship.\n\"For me and a lot of people who worked with Americans, fought with Americans, want the American dream \u2014 I think America should give them something special,\" Walker told PJ Media.\nUpdate March 20 at 12:36 p.m.: Johnny Walker got his citizenship this morning! And his real name is Riyadh Ahmed Khalaf Al Ahmady. He goes by \"Riyadh.\"\nFollow Tyler O'Neil, the author of this article, on Twitter at @Tyler2ONeil.",

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Nine years ago last month, I was <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2010/02/04/struck-down-feds-refuse-to-explain-how-agent-injured-daily-caller-writer/\">struck down</a> while crossing the street in Washington, D.C. My knee was shattered and I ended up needing two major surgeries and many months of physical therapy. All told, it was 18 months before I was able to walk again unaided. And the whole time, I was in severe pain, often excruciating. I wouldn't have gotten through that ordeal without pain medication. At various stages I was taking Dilaudid, OxyContin, or Vicodin. I hated the side effects, like nausea and confusion and sweating, and I was worried about getting hooked. But I didn't. As the pain eased, my doctors lowered the dosage until I didn't need it anymore. My knee still hurts, pretty much every day, but it's manageable. Pain medication helped me get through the worst thing that ever happened to me, and then I walked away from it. Literally.</p>\n<p>So whenever I see meddling politicians trying to take those decisions away from me because other people make the wrong decisions, I get really angry.</p>\n<blockquote data-lang=\"en\">   <p>If we want to end the opioid epidemic, we must work to address the root causes of abuse. That&rsquo;s why <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenCoryGardner?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SenCoryGardner</a> and I introduced legislation to limit opioid prescriptions for acute pain to 7 days.

She used to hold a much different view about who should be responsible for such decisions:</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://static.pjmedia.com/trending/user-content/51/files/2019/03/gillibrand_01.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://static.pjmedia.com/trending/user-content/51/files/2019/03/gillibrand_01.png\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://static.pjmedia.com/trending/user-content/51/files/2019/03/gillibrand_02.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://static.pjmedia.com/trending/user-content/51/files/2019/03/gillibrand_02.png\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://static.pjmedia.com/trending/user-content/51/files/2019/03/gillibrand_03.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://static.pjmedia.com/trending/user-content/51/files/2019/03/gillibrand_03.png\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>&quot;Keep Your Laws Off My Body&quot; only counts when a woman wants to kill her baby before it inconveniences her.</p>\n<p>You want government-run healthcare? This is what it looks like.

                "text": "Nine years ago last month, I was struck down while crossing the street in Washington, D.C. My knee was shattered and I ended up needing two major surgeries and many months of physical therapy. All told, it was 18 months before I was able to walk again unaided. And the whole time, I was in severe pain, often excruciating. I wouldn't have gotten through that ordeal without pain medication. At various stages I was taking Dilaudid, OxyContin, or Vicodin. I hated the side effects, like nausea and confusion and sweating, and I was worried about getting hooked. But I didn't. As the pain eased, my doctors lowered the dosage until I didn't need it anymore. My knee still hurts, pretty much every day, but it's manageable. Pain medication helped me get through the worst thing that ever happened to me, and then I walked away from it. Literally.\nSo whenever I see meddling politicians trying to take those decisions away from me because other people make the wrong decisions, I get really angry.\nIf we want to end the opioid epidemic, we must work to address the root causes of abuse. That\u2019s why @SenCoryGardner and I introduced legislation to limit opioid prescriptions for acute pain to 7 days. Because no one needs a month\u2019s supply for a wisdom tooth extraction.\n\u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (@gillibrandny) March 15, 2019\nSo people who are genuinely in pain need to suffer, just because Kirsten Gillibrand wants to be president?\nAs with just about everything Gillibrand says, this directly contradicts her past rhetoric. She used to hold a much different view about who should be responsible for such decisions:\n\"Keep Your Laws Off My Body\" only counts when a woman wants to kill her baby before it inconveniences her.\nYou want government-run healthcare? This is what it looks like. People you'll probably never meet in your entire life, who don't know anything about you, will decide how much pain you get to live with.\nKirsten Gillibrand is never going to be POTUS, and she's never going to be my doctor.",

When will the breaking point happen? Americans cannot allow this vast injustice to continue unanswered. The law must be applied equally across party lines or there is no law and only chaos.

In fact, the more this goes on, the more clear it becomes that when Mueller walked away, his probe was still ramping up, not winding down. Today, Mueller&rsquo;s team handed off several key ongoing Trump-Russia related criminal cases. So what does it mean?</p>\n<p>Court filings today revealed that Team Mueller has just handed off the following cases to various permanent federal prosecutors: the existing Roger Stone criminal indictments, the ongoing grand jury matter involving Stone&rsquo;s associate Andrew Miller, the indictments against Russian hackers, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zoetillman/status/1118235607749267457\">more</a>. These were all flagged by BuzzFeed&rsquo;s Zoe Tillman. Here&rsquo;s the thing: this doesn&rsquo;t mean that any of these cases are being put to bed. Instead, the handoff means &ndash; on paper at least &ndash; that these cases, and Mueller&rsquo;s other ongoing cases, are supposed to move forward full steam ahead without him.</p>\n<p>This brings us back to the essential question we&rsquo;ve been asking since it was announced that Robert Mueller was quitting and going home. Did Mueller decide that it was time to inform the public about Donald Trump&rsquo;s crimes in the form of a final report, and decide to disband his own team because he figured the final report would get him fired anyway? Or did William Barr force Mueller off the job?</p>\n<p>This matters, because it helps us to understand what&rsquo;s likely to happen with these cases that have been handed off. If this is all Barr&rsquo;s doing, he may be planning to quietly shut these ongoing cases down, to whatever extent he can. But if this is all Mueller&rsquo;s doing, he may have pushed these cases far enough below decks at the DOJ that Barr can&rsquo;t interfere with them, at least without making a scene in the process. Let&rsquo;s keep watching where these handed-off cases go next. It&rsquo;ll tell us a lot about who&rsquo;s really been driving this train.</p>",

                "text": "So much for the notion that Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation was finished when he abruptly ended his work and handed in a four hundred page report about Donald Trump. In fact, the more this goes on, the more clear it becomes that when Mueller walked away, his probe was still ramping up, not winding down. Today, Mueller\u2019s team handed off several key ongoing Trump-Russia related criminal cases. So what does it mean?\nCourt filings today revealed that Team Mueller has just handed off the following cases to various permanent federal prosecutors: the existing Roger Stone criminal indictments, the ongoing grand jury matter involving Stone\u2019s associate Andrew Miller, the indictments against Russian hackers, and more. These were all flagged by BuzzFeed\u2019s Zoe Tillman. Here\u2019s the thing: this doesn\u2019t mean that any of these cases are being put to bed. Instead, the handoff means \u2013 on paper at least \u2013 that these cases, and Mueller\u2019s other ongoing cases, are supposed to move forward full steam ahead without him.\nThis brings us back to the essential question we\u2019ve been asking since it was announced that Robert Mueller was quitting and going home. Did Mueller decide that it was time to inform the public about Donald Trump\u2019s crimes in the form of a final report, and decide to disband his own team because he figured the final report would get him fired anyway? Or did William Barr force Mueller off the job?\nThis matters, because it helps us to understand what\u2019s likely to happen with these cases that have been handed off. If this is all Barr\u2019s doing, he may be planning to quietly shut these ongoing cases down, to whatever extent he can. But if this is all Mueller\u2019s doing, he may have pushed these cases far enough below decks at the DOJ that Barr can\u2019t interfere with them, at least without making a scene in the process. Let\u2019s keep watching where these handed-off cases go next. It\u2019ll tell us a lot about who\u2019s really been driving this train.",

This number sounded low to us, and we pointed out that based on their track record, we had no reason whatsoever to take the Republicans on this committee at their word. Now it turns out they were indeed fibbing the numbers &ndash; and we suspect we know why.</p>\n<p>This evening Rachel Maddow revealed during her MSNBC show that the number of people who met the deadline is actually much higher. While eight people submitted their documents electronically, an unstated number of additional people sent paper documents to the House, which take longer to process. The Republicans on the committee know full well how this kind of thing works. So why would they pretend the number is so much lower than it is?</p>\n<p>The thing about a massive document request operation is that while some people will definitely cooperate and others will never voluntarily cooperate, there are those on the fence who will be looking around to see what everyone else does. Let&rsquo;s say that you and another person on the document request list had a crucial email exchange. If the other person is cooperating, that means the committee already has those emails, so there&rsquo;s no reason for you to risk being held in contempt of Congress just to avoid having to turn those emails in.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re tempted to fight the document request, and you find out that only a small handful of the other people on the list have cooperated, you&rsquo;re going to feel more confident about standing your ground. This is surely why Donald Trump&rsquo;s Republican allies tried to create the false appearance today that almost no one was cooperating. Now we wait for the real number. Once that surfaces, we expect to see more people give in and cooperate.</p>",

                "text": "Earlier today, the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee announced that just eight people and entities, out of eighty-one in total, had met yesterday\u2019s document request deadline. This number sounded low to us, and we pointed out that based on their track record, we had no reason whatsoever to take the Republicans on this committee at their word. Now it turns out they were indeed fibbing the numbers \u2013 and we suspect we know why.\nThis evening Rachel Maddow revealed during her MSNBC show that the number of people who met the deadline is actually much higher. While eight people submitted their documents electronically, an unstated number of additional people sent paper documents to the House, which take longer to process. The Republicans on the committee know full well how this kind of thing works. So why would they pretend the number is so much lower than it is?\nThe thing about a massive document request operation is that while some people will definitely cooperate and others will never voluntarily cooperate, there are those on the fence who will be looking around to see what everyone else does. Let\u2019s say that you and another person on the document request list had a crucial email exchange. If the other person is cooperating, that means the committee already has those emails, so there\u2019s no reason for you to risk being held in contempt of Congress just to avoid having to turn those emails in.\nIf you\u2019re tempted to fight the document request, and you find out that only a small handful of the other people on the list have cooperated, you\u2019re going to feel more confident about standing your ground. This is surely why Donald Trump\u2019s Republican allies tried to create the false appearance today that almost no one was cooperating. Now we wait for the real number. Once that surfaces, we expect to see more people give in and cooperate.",

Remember that? Me neither. That kind of behavior is strictly the dominion of the Adolescent-in-Chief.</p>\n<p>Well, get ready for what is turning out to be the tedious next chapter in a Tolstoy-length novel of pure Hillary-blaming, by none other than &ldquo;Whining Donald&rdquo; Trump. The &ldquo;president,&rdquo; who is such a genius he doesn&rsquo;t want us to see his SAT scores or grades, and is so rich he doesn&rsquo;t want us to see his tax returns, is now so innocent he doesn&rsquo;t want us to see the Mueller report. But since the (heavily redacted) Mueller report is to be released on Thursday anyway, Trump has begun rehearsals for his latest song and dance: &ldquo;Blame Hillary: the Musical.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s right, the bogey woman who is so powerful that Whining Donald simply cannot get free of her, is back to haunting poor little Donny&rsquo;s nap time once again. The strategy, cooked up by Trump and his team of bloodsucking lawyers, is to change the subject of the Mueller Report to Hillary instead. Their specious rationale? According to Vanity Fair, it was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/04/donald-trump-mueller-report-release\">Hillary all along</a> who concocted the Steele Dossier, by colluding with the Russians.</p>\n<p>The actual truth &ndash; a thing Trump has a positive allergy for &ndash; is that a US research firm, Fusion GPS, contracted former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dossier that ended up alleging, among other things, collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Steele&rsquo;s work was paid for by the Washington Free Beacon, a Republican media outfit, with the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign &ldquo;picking up the tab&rdquo; after Trump won his party&rsquo;s nomination. So the Steele dossier had no pro-Democrat agenda at its inception. If anything, its antecedents would suggest a Republican bias. That its conclusions were steeply unfavorable to Trump is a problem Whining Donald will have to take up with reality, a thing with which he is at continuous war anyway, so it should be familiar territory.</p>",

                "text": "Remember, after the 2012 presidential election, how Barack Obama simply could not let go of the fact that Mitt Romney got 206 electoral college votes, and how, years after that election, Obama continued to blame Mitt for every misstep he and his administration made, and how Obama kept referring to Mitt Romney as \u201cCrooked Mitt\u201d? Remember that? Me neither. That kind of behavior is strictly the dominion of the Adolescent-in-Chief.\nWell, get ready for what is turning out to be the tedious next chapter in a Tolstoy-length novel of pure Hillary-blaming, by none other than \u201cWhining Donald\u201d Trump. The \u201cpresident,\u201d who is such a genius he doesn\u2019t want us to see his SAT scores or grades, and is so rich he doesn\u2019t want us to see his tax returns, is now so innocent he doesn\u2019t want us to see the Mueller report. But since the (heavily redacted) Mueller report is to be released on Thursday anyway, Trump has begun rehearsals for his latest song and dance: \u201cBlame Hillary: the Musical.\u201d\nThat\u2019s right, the bogey woman who is so powerful that Whining Donald simply cannot get free of her, is back to haunting poor little Donny\u2019s nap time once again. The strategy, cooked up by Trump and his team of bloodsucking lawyers, is to change the subject of the Mueller Report to Hillary instead. Their specious rationale? According to Vanity Fair, it was Hillary all along who concocted the Steele Dossier, by colluding with the Russians.\nThe actual truth \u2013 a thing Trump has a positive allergy for \u2013 is that a US research firm, Fusion GPS, contracted former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dossier that ended up alleging, among other things, collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Steele\u2019s work was paid for by the Washington Free Beacon, a Republican media outfit, with the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign \u201cpicking up the tab\u201d after Trump won his party\u2019s nomination. So the Steele dossier had no pro-Democrat agenda at its inception. If anything, its antecedents would suggest a Republican bias. That its conclusions were steeply unfavorable to Trump is a problem Whining Donald will have to take up with reality, a thing with which he is at continuous war anyway, so it should be familiar territory.",

This included $2.8 million in restitution and another $5.6 million in penalties. At the time, Palmer Report pointed out that because Trump runs a debt-based cash-poor business model, he might have to sell off assets just to pay the fines &ndash; particularly if they kept piling up. It turns out we may or may not have been onto something.</p>\n<p>Today it&rsquo;s being reported that Donald Trump sold one of his New York City condos back on March 8th. Forbes is hitting on two key suspicious <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2019/03/19/mysterious-buyer-pumps-29-million-into-president-trumps-coffers/#7965d0ac5777\">points</a>. First, the buyer appears to have used a series of shell corporations to try to hide his or her real identity. Second, the buyer appears to have paid Trump far more than market value. These are both matters of concern. But what caught our eye is the specific dollar amount: $2.9 million. Sound familiar?</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s right. Just one week before it was announced that Donald Trump was getting hit with a $2.8 million fine, he sold off a property for $2.9 million, which was conveniently just enough to cover the cost of the fine. Is this merely an interesting coincidence, or is Trump indeed selling off assets in order to get enough cash to pay his fines?</p>\n<p>Trump was also hit with the separate $5.6 million fine, in addition to the $2.8 million fine. But he sold the property before the fines were publicly announced. It&rsquo;s possible he knew the $2.8 million restitution charge was coming, and he wanted to generate enough cash to cover it, but he didn&rsquo;t know the extra $5.6 million charge was coming.</p>\n<p>Of course Donald Trump will likely try to fight these fines in court. But if the courts rule against him, and he doesn&rsquo;t have the cash on hand to pay the fines, New York State could decide to seize some of his assets in order to make up for it. So yeah, Trump could be trying to get out ahead of this. Or it could simply be a coincidence that he found some shady buyer to pay him an overinflated $2.9 million, just as he was finding himself on the hook for $2.8 million.</p>",

                "text": "Last week the New York Attorney General announced that she was hitting Donald Trump with millions of dollars in fines over his abuse of the Trump Foundation nonprofit charity. This included $2.8 million in restitution and another $5.6 million in penalties. At the time, Palmer Report pointed out that because Trump runs a debt-based cash-poor business model, he might have to sell off assets just to pay the fines \u2013 particularly if they kept piling up. It turns out we may or may not have been onto something.\nToday it\u2019s being reported that Donald Trump sold one of his New York City condos back on March 8th. Forbes is hitting on two key suspicious points. First, the buyer appears to have used a series of shell corporations to try to hide his or her real identity. Second, the buyer appears to have paid Trump far more than market value. These are both matters of concern. But what caught our eye is the specific dollar amount: $2.9 million. Sound familiar?\nThat\u2019s right. Just one week before it was announced that Donald Trump was getting hit with a $2.8 million fine, he sold off a property for $2.9 million, which was conveniently just enough to cover the cost of the fine. Is this merely an interesting coincidence, or is Trump indeed selling off assets in order to get enough cash to pay his fines?\nTrump was also hit with the separate $5.6 million fine, in addition to the $2.8 million fine. But he sold the property before the fines were publicly announced. It\u2019s possible he knew the $2.8 million restitution charge was coming, and he wanted to generate enough cash to cover it, but he didn\u2019t know the extra $5.6 million charge was coming.\nOf course Donald Trump will likely try to fight these fines in court. But if the courts rule against him, and he doesn\u2019t have the cash on hand to pay the fines, New York State could decide to seize some of his assets in order to make up for it. So yeah, Trump could be trying to get out ahead of this. Or it could simply be a coincidence that he found some shady buyer to pay him an overinflated $2.9 million, just as he was finding himself on the hook for $2.8 million.",

Every day our country is suffering in some way because of our leaders. Now, it&rsquo;s members of the transgender community who are being punished for who they are by banning them from the Military.</p>\n<p>I served in the United States Army for over thirteen years. One of the first lessons I remember from Basic Combat Training is that in the Army it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are man, woman, white, black, etc.; we are all American soldiers. So why can&rsquo;t this be the same for the transgender community? Only around one percent of people in the United States join the military, and we are at a time we can&rsquo;t afford to lose more people just because of hate.</p>\n<p>Soldiers of any gender identity go through stress with various issues, and we shouldn&rsquo;t let ignorance be the determining factor for separating trans people, as that does a disservice to them, and harms them in many ways. Since I am not a transgender person myself, I can&rsquo;t say how this would make one feel, but segregating them like they are a different species is evil, hateful, and again, a human rights violation. Many have performed with exemplary merit during their time in service, and we need to do the right thing by keeping them in the military.</p>\n<p>Leaders need to think about the aftermath of banning or kicking out transgender soldiers, because many had it in mind to make the military a twenty year career with no back up plan. In some cases you can literally force human beings to live in the streets just because of hateful ignorance, and this is not right. We need to get involved with Congress and demand a stop to this ban, because it will do more harm than good. Lastly what will it take for this President to be held accountable?</p>",

                "text": "I don\u2019t think there has been a day that goes by where Donald Trump hasn\u2019t violated some form of human rights, whether it\u2019s encouraging punitive actions towards black football players who exercise free speech during the National Anthem, or endangering the lives of Democratic members of Congress as well as members of the press. Every day our country is suffering in some way because of our leaders. Now, it\u2019s members of the transgender community who are being punished for who they are by banning them from the Military.\nI served in the United States Army for over thirteen years. One of the first lessons I remember from Basic Combat Training is that in the Army it doesn\u2019t matter if you are man, woman, white, black, etc.; we are all American soldiers. So why can\u2019t this be the same for the transgender community? Only around one percent of people in the United States join the military, and we are at a time we can\u2019t afford to lose more people just because of hate.\nSoldiers of any gender identity go through stress with various issues, and we shouldn\u2019t let ignorance be the determining factor for separating trans people, as that does a disservice to them, and harms them in many ways. Since I am not a transgender person myself, I can\u2019t say how this would make one feel, but segregating them like they are a different species is evil, hateful, and again, a human rights violation. Many have performed with exemplary merit during their time in service, and we need to do the right thing by keeping them in the military.\nLeaders need to think about the aftermath of banning or kicking out transgender soldiers, because many had it in mind to make the military a twenty year career with no back up plan. In some cases you can literally force human beings to live in the streets just because of hateful ignorance, and this is not right. We need to get involved with Congress and demand a stop to this ban, because it will do more harm than good. Lastly what will it take for this President to be held accountable?",

Even as we try to recover from the shock of Team Trump reaching a new criminal low, let&rsquo;s talk about why Gaetz is throwing his life away to try to help Trump.</p>\n<p>There are only two possible explanations for why Matt Gaetz posted that tweet about Michael Cohen. The first is that Gaetz was simply too stupid to understand that a tweet like that was going to get him criminally indicted. The second is that Gaetz didn&rsquo;t care that the tweet was going to get him indicted, because he already has bigger problems to worry about. Now is a good time to take a trip back to July of 2018.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s when the Department of Justice revealed indictments against a dozen Russian government hackers. In the indictment it was revealed that after the Russians stole DNC emails and gave them to WikiLeaks, but before WikiLeaks publicly released them, an unnamed 2016 candidate for Congress reportedly <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/396910-court-filing-congressional-candidate-asked-russian-operatives-for\">obtained those emails</a> from the Russians and used them in the campaign.</p>\n<p>We still have no idea who that candidate is. However, right after this news was revealed, Donald Trump made a point of tweeting a glowing endorsement of Matt Gaetz, despite being in the midst of an overseas trip. Did this mean that Gaetz was the 2016 candidate referenced in the indictment, and that Trump&rsquo;s tweet was his way of urging Gaetz not to flip? Or did Gaetz have nothing to do with the indictments, and Trump&rsquo;s tweet was just a grand coincidence? Also, is it a coincidence that Matt Gaetz is friends with Roger Stone, who&rsquo;s been indicted for his role in the theft of those emails?</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re not the ones who dragged Matt Gaetz&rsquo;s name into it, of course; Donald Trump did that. But Gaetz just posted a tweet that anyone with even a basic understanding of U.S. law would understand was going to result in 1) the end of his career, and 2) the potential for prison. Is Gaetz already in so much legal trouble, he figured he had nothing else to lose, and he&rsquo;s playing for a pardon? Or did Gaetz just stupidly throw his life away for no reason?</p>",

                "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s close ally Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz committed felony witness tampering in plain sight on Tuesday evening when he posted a threatening tweet aimed at Michael Cohen, on the eve of Cohen\u2019s public testimony before the House Oversight Committee. Even as we try to recover from the shock of Team Trump reaching a new criminal low, let\u2019s talk about why Gaetz is throwing his life away to try to help Trump.\nThere are only two possible explanations for why Matt Gaetz posted that tweet about Michael Cohen. The first is that Gaetz was simply too stupid to understand that a tweet like that was going to get him criminally indicted. The second is that Gaetz didn\u2019t care that the tweet was going to get him indicted, because he already has bigger problems to worry about. Now is a good time to take a trip back to July of 2018.\nThat\u2019s when the Department of Justice revealed indictments against a dozen Russian government hackers. In the indictment it was revealed that after the Russians stole DNC emails and gave them to WikiLeaks, but before WikiLeaks publicly released them, an unnamed 2016 candidate for Congress reportedly obtained those emails from the Russians and used them in the campaign.\nWe still have no idea who that candidate is. However, right after this news was revealed, Donald Trump made a point of tweeting a glowing endorsement of Matt Gaetz, despite being in the midst of an overseas trip. Did this mean that Gaetz was the 2016 candidate referenced in the indictment, and that Trump\u2019s tweet was his way of urging Gaetz not to flip? Or did Gaetz have nothing to do with the indictments, and Trump\u2019s tweet was just a grand coincidence? Also, is it a coincidence that Matt Gaetz is friends with Roger Stone, who\u2019s been indicted for his role in the theft of those emails?\nWe\u2019re not the ones who dragged Matt Gaetz\u2019s name into it, of course; Donald Trump did that. But Gaetz just posted a tweet that anyone with even a basic understanding of U.S. law would understand was going to result in 1) the end of his career, and 2) the potential for prison. Is Gaetz already in so much legal trouble, he figured he had nothing else to lose, and he\u2019s playing for a pardon? Or did Gaetz just stupidly throw his life away for no reason?",

First, he said he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t mind&rdquo; the release. Recently he&rsquo;s resumed his previous attacks on Mueller&rsquo;s team and the report itself. So what gives? Watching Trump flip flop on issues is something we have all come to expect, but after his crowing about &ldquo;no collusion, complete exoneration,&rdquo; and other Trump-like nonsense, what has made him change his mind? According to Rolling Stone and ABC News, he has been briefed on information in the report that points strongly to his guilt on obstruction.</p>\n<p>When William Barr issued his ridiculous &ldquo;summary&rdquo; of Mueller&rsquo;s report, Trump wore out the terms &ldquo;no collusion&rdquo; and &ldquo;no obstruction.&rdquo; He even complimented Mueller&rsquo;s findings, calling them the result of &ldquo;great intelligence.&rdquo; Mueller&rsquo;s actual report found no such thing. In fact, he was clear that the information &ldquo;does not exonerate the president.&rdquo; Trump, of course, chose to ignore that one very powerful sentence, which may now come back to haunt him.</p>\n<p>Both Jonathan Karl of <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/significant-concern-wh-mueller-report-jonathan-karl-62392311\">ABC News</a> and Ryan Bort of <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/why-the-mueller-report-is-causing-breakdown-level-stress-among-white-house-staff-822883/?fbclid=IwAR0dgW3yCJF3e-6hTE_boo8MgsFP4hlzzdcRUM_G0wDBDFCE3PaWDmrt_ts\">Rolling Stone</a> believe that Trump&rsquo;s renewed attacks stem from his team&rsquo;s failure to consider one issue: Don McGhan&rsquo;s thirty-plus hours spent with Mueller&rsquo;s team. To date, no one knows the content of those meetings, and any information he provided may well be contained in the report. Considering McGhan&rsquo;s testimony and the recent leaks from Mueller&rsquo;s team published in the New York Times, the White House is and should be worried. According to Karl, Trump&rsquo;s firing of Comey, his anger at and eventual firing of Sessions for recusing himself, and Trump&rsquo;s purported attempts to fire Mueller all point toward his guilt on obstruction.</p>\n<p>Unless information shared by McGhan relates to ongoing criminal investigations and/or possible indictments, that information may be revealed and could look very bad for Trump. In addition to McGhan, NBC News reports that several other White House officials, both current and former, have contacted the Justice Department to inquire about redacting their names or removing information that identifies them, leaving the door open for even more negative information about Trump.</p>\n<p>While this all sounds damning for Trump, Karl reports that attorneys for &ldquo;President&rdquo; Trump are preparing a rebuttal to the report, making it plausible that they have, at the very least, been briefed about the report. Karl finds it &ldquo;disgusting&rdquo; that Barr refused to answer questions regarding a White House briefing when it appears clear that they have done so. As so many, including Speaker Pelosi, have alleged, Karl states that &ldquo;Barr is working with the WH against the American people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Barr will continue to work against us. It is blatantly obvious that he will try to protect Trump from any real harm, regardless of the Special Counsel&rsquo;s findings. The presence of William Barr makes it even more important that the people do what we have to do to rid this country of the scourge called Trump. We can obviously display our discontent by vote, and if we need to take to the streets, let&rsquo;s get to taking. We need to stand together to ensure that our government returns to &ldquo;government of the people, by the people, for the people&rdquo; and not for corrupt criminals like Donald Trump.</p>",

                "text": "\u201cPresident\u201d Donald Trump has gone back and forth about his feelings regarding the release of the Mueller report. First, he said he \u201cdidn\u2019t mind\u201d the release. Recently he\u2019s resumed his previous attacks on Mueller\u2019s team and the report itself. So what gives? Watching Trump flip flop on issues is something we have all come to expect, but after his crowing about \u201cno collusion, complete exoneration,\u201d and other Trump-like nonsense, what has made him change his mind? According to Rolling Stone and ABC News, he has been briefed on information in the report that points strongly to his guilt on obstruction.\nWhen William Barr issued his ridiculous \u201csummary\u201d of Mueller\u2019s report, Trump wore out the terms \u201cno collusion\u201d and \u201cno obstruction.\u201d He even complimented Mueller\u2019s findings, calling them the result of \u201cgreat intelligence.\u201d Mueller\u2019s actual report found no such thing. In fact, he was clear that the information \u201cdoes not exonerate the president.\u201d Trump, of course, chose to ignore that one very powerful sentence, which may now come back to haunt him.\nBoth Jonathan Karl of ABC News and Ryan Bort of Rolling Stone believe that Trump\u2019s renewed attacks stem from his team\u2019s failure to consider one issue: Don McGhan\u2019s thirty-plus hours spent with Mueller\u2019s team. To date, no one knows the content of those meetings, and any information he provided may well be contained in the report. Considering McGhan\u2019s testimony and the recent leaks from Mueller\u2019s team published in the New York Times, the White House is and should be worried. According to Karl, Trump\u2019s firing of Comey, his anger at and eventual firing of Sessions for recusing himself, and Trump\u2019s purported attempts to fire Mueller all point toward his guilt on obstruction.\nUnless information shared by McGhan relates to ongoing criminal investigations and/or possible indictments, that information may be revealed and could look very bad for Trump. In addition to McGhan, NBC News reports that several other White House officials, both current and former, have contacted the Justice Department to inquire about redacting their names or removing information that identifies them, leaving the door open for even more negative information about Trump.\nWhile this all sounds damning for Trump, Karl reports that attorneys for \u201cPresident\u201d Trump are preparing a rebuttal to the report, making it plausible that they have, at the very least, been briefed about the report. Karl finds it \u201cdisgusting\u201d that Barr refused to answer questions regarding a White House briefing when it appears clear that they have done so. As so many, including Speaker Pelosi, have alleged, Karl states that \u201cBarr is working with the WH against the American people.\u201d\nBarr will continue to work against us. It is blatantly obvious that he will try to protect Trump from any real harm, regardless of the Special Counsel\u2019s findings. The presence of William Barr makes it even more important that the people do what we have to do to rid this country of the scourge called Trump. We can obviously display our discontent by vote, and if we need to take to the streets, let\u2019s get to taking. We need to stand together to ensure that our government returns to \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people\u201d and not for corrupt criminals like Donald Trump.",

Robert Duncan, U.S. attorney for eastern Kentucky, called the doctors involved &ldquo;white-coated drug dealers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Authorities said the 60 includes 53 medical professionals tied to some 350,000 prescriptions and 32 million pills. The operation was conducted by the federal Appalachian Regional Prescription Opioid Strike Force, launched last year by the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>Authorities said arrests were being made and search warrants carried out as they announced the charges at a news conference. They didn&rsquo;t immediately name those being charged.</p>\n<p>U.S. health authorities have reported there were more than 70,000 drug overdose deaths in 2017, for a rate of 21.7 per 100,000 people. West Virginia and Ohio have regularly been among the states with the highest overdose death rates as the opioid crisis has swelled in recent years.</p>\n<p>Among those charged was a Tennessee doctor who dubbed himself the &ldquo;Rock Doc&rdquo; and is accused of prescribing dangerous combinations of drugs such as fentanyl and oxycodone, sometimes in exchange for sex, authorities said</p>\n<p>Others include a Kentucky doctor who is accused of writing prescriptions to Facebook friends who came to his home to pick them up, another who allegedly left signed blank prescriptions for staff to fill out and give to patients he hadn&rsquo;t seen, and a Kentucky dentist accused of removing teeth unnecessarily and scheduling unneeded follow-up appointments.</p>\n<p>A Dayton, Ohio, doctor was accused of running a &ldquo;pill mill&rdquo; that allegedly dispensed 1.75 million pills in a two-year period. Authorities said an Alabama doctor recruited prostitutes and other women he had sexual relations with to his clinic and allowed them to abuse drugs in his home.</p>\n<p>Most of those charged came from the five strike force states of Alabama, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia. One person each was also arrested in Pennsylvania and Louisiana.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The opioid crisis is the deadliest drug crisis in American history, and Appalachia has suffered the consequences more than perhaps any other region,&rdquo; U.S. Attorney General William Barr said in a statement in Washington.</p>",

Robert Duncan, U.S. attorney for eastern Kentucky, called the doctors involved \u201cwhite-coated drug dealers.\u201d\nAuthorities said the 60 includes 53 medical professionals tied to some 350,000 prescriptions and 32 million pills. The operation was conducted by the federal Appalachian Regional Prescription Opioid Strike Force, launched last year by the Trump administration.\nAuthorities said arrests were being made and search warrants carried out as they announced the charges at a news conference. They didn\u2019t immediately name those being charged.\nU.S. health authorities have reported there were more than 70,000 drug overdose deaths in 2017, for a rate of 21.7 per 100,000 people. West Virginia and Ohio have regularly been among the states with the highest overdose death rates as the opioid crisis has swelled in recent years.\nAmong those charged was a Tennessee doctor who dubbed himself the \u201cRock Doc\u201d and is accused of prescribing dangerous combinations of drugs such as fentanyl and oxycodone, sometimes in exchange for sex, authorities said\nOthers include a Kentucky doctor who is accused of writing prescriptions to Facebook friends who came to his home to pick them up, another who allegedly left signed blank prescriptions for staff to fill out and give to patients he hadn\u2019t seen, and a Kentucky dentist accused of removing teeth unnecessarily and scheduling unneeded follow-up appointments.\nA Dayton, Ohio, doctor was accused of running a \u201cpill mill\u201d that allegedly dispensed 1.75 million pills in a two-year period. Authorities said an Alabama doctor recruited prostitutes and other women he had sexual relations with to his clinic and allowed them to abuse drugs in his home.\nMost of those charged came from the five strike force states of Alabama, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia. One person each was also arrested in Pennsylvania and Louisiana.\n\u201cThe opioid crisis is the deadliest drug crisis in American history, and Appalachia has suffered the consequences more than perhaps any other region,\u201d U.S. Attorney General William Barr said in a statement in Washington.",

Their attorney, Robert Krakow, claimed the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine &ldquo;can cause many vaccine injuries, including encephalitis and death.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Medical experts have debunked those claims and proven that the vaccine is safe, but opposition to vaccines persists.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In 2017, measles killed 110,000 people worldwide, mostly children under the age of 5,&rdquo; Day said in announcing the new anti-measles rules in Rockland.</p>\n<p>Under the county&rsquo;s Communicable Disease and Exposure Exclusion Order, anyone either diagnosed with measles or exposed to a person who has been diagnosed with measles must stay away from indoor and outdoor places of assembly for up to 21 days. Violators could be fined $2,000 per day.</p>\n<p>While no one in the county has died of measles, the disease has caused several hospitalizations and a premature birth.</p>\n<p>Rockland County announced the new tactics to fight measles after an earlier order banning all unvaccinated children from indoor public places was halted by a judge. The county is appealing that ruling.</p>\n<p>The measles cases in Rockland and in Brooklyn have been traced to unvaccinated members of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community who traveled to Israel, where a measles outbreak is occurring.</p>\n<p>Orthodox Jewish leaders say a small faction of vaccine opponents in the community has allowed the disease to spread.</p>\n<p>A Yiddish-language newspaper that serves the ultra-Orthodox community in Brooklyn&rsquo;s Williamsburg section took the rare step last week of publishing an editorial in English excoriating those who refuse to vaccinate.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When it&rsquo;s time to decide if to have a serious surgery, you don&rsquo;t turn to a hotlines, but you go to a conventional doctor,&rdquo; the editorial in Der Yid read. &ldquo;When you need a referral to a good doctor for a serious health problem you don&rsquo;t stand at the bus stop to and take a poll of friends for the right address, but you call those devoted rabbis who understand medical matters or the recognized medical referral agencies who are familiar with the best doctors. All of them say that one must vaccinate.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "NEW YORK \u2014 Officials trying to contain a measles outbreak in a county north of New York City on Tuesday ordered all unvaccinated people exposed to the disease barred from public gathering places, including houses of worship, for up to three weeks.\nThe order, issued by Rockland County, comes one day after New York City closed a preschool over non-compliance with measles vaccine requirements.\nBoth the county and city are struggling to contain a swelling number of measles cases centered in ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods while battling lawsuits over their efforts to require vaccinations.\nRockland County issued its order three days ahead of the start of Passover, when many families travel to be together and gather in synagogues.\n\u201cNeed we wait for someone to die?\u201d Rockland County Executive Ed Day said in announcing the measure.\nNew York officials provided an update on Wednesday over the measles outbreak in New York.\nNew York City\u2019s Board of Health will vote Wednesday on whether to extend an emergency declaration last week ordering mandatory vaccinations in four Brooklyn ZIP codes.\nHealth officials have confirmed 329 cases of measles in the city and 184 cases in Rockland since the outbreak of the highly contagious disease began in October.\nAfter announcing the vaccination order on April 9, the city took the step Monday of closing the preschool portion of a private Jewish school because the school had failed to turn over vaccination and attendance records.\n\u201cThis is about protecting kids and it\u2019s also about protecting some adults, including pregnant women, folks who are going through medical treatment like chemotherapy, some senior with compromised health conditions,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a TV interview . \u201cMeasles is very, very serious.\u201d\nREAD MORE: U.S. measles count up to 555, with most new cases in New York\nAlso on Monday, a group of parents filed a lawsuit against the vaccination order, arguing it was \u201carbitrary, capricious, contrary to law and in violation of petitioners\u2019 rights under the United States Constitution and New York State law.\u201d\nA judge in Brooklyn state Supreme Court declined to issue an injunction barring the city from enforcing the order, and the parties will appear in court Thursday.\nThe plaintiffs in the lawsuit are identified by their initials. Their attorney, Robert Krakow, claimed the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine \u201ccan cause many vaccine injuries, including encephalitis and death.\u201d\nMedical experts have debunked those claims and proven that the vaccine is safe, but opposition to vaccines persists.\n\u201cIn 2017, measles killed 110,000 people worldwide, mostly children under the age of 5,\u201d Day said in announcing the new anti-measles rules in Rockland.\nUnder the county\u2019s Communicable Disease and Exposure Exclusion Order, anyone either diagnosed with measles or exposed to a person who has been diagnosed with measles must stay away from indoor and outdoor places of assembly for up to 21 days. Violators could be fined $2,000 per day.\nWhile no one in the county has died of measles, the disease has caused several hospitalizations and a premature birth.\nRockland County announced the new tactics to fight measles after an earlier order banning all unvaccinated children from indoor public places was halted by a judge. The county is appealing that ruling.\nThe measles cases in Rockland and in Brooklyn have been traced to unvaccinated members of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community who traveled to Israel, where a measles outbreak is occurring.\nOrthodox Jewish leaders say a small faction of vaccine opponents in the community has allowed the disease to spread.\nA Yiddish-language newspaper that serves the ultra-Orthodox community in Brooklyn\u2019s Williamsburg section took the rare step last week of publishing an editorial in English excoriating those who refuse to vaccinate.\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s time to decide if to have a serious surgery, you don\u2019t turn to a hotlines, but you go to a conventional doctor,\u201d the editorial in Der Yid read. \u201cWhen you need a referral to a good doctor for a serious health problem you don\u2019t stand at the bus stop to and take a poll of friends for the right address, but you call those devoted rabbis who understand medical matters or the recognized medical referral agencies who are familiar with the best doctors. All of them say that one must vaccinate.\u201d",

He and other farmers have worked until midnight for days to move grain, equipment and fuel barrels away from the floodwaters fed by heavy rain and snowmelt. The rising water that has damaged hundreds of homes and been blamed for three deaths has also taken a heavy toll on agriculture, inundating thousands of acres, threatening stockpiled grain and killing livestock.</p>\n<p>In Fremont County alone, Jorgenson estimates that more than a million bushels of corn and nearly half a million bushels of soybeans have been lost after water overwhelmed grain bins before they could be emptied of last year&rsquo;s crop. His calculation using local grain prices puts the financial loss at more than $7 million in grain alone. That&rsquo;s for about 28 farmers in his immediate area, he said.</p>\n<p>Once it&rsquo;s deposited in bins, grain is not insured, so it&rsquo;s just lost money. This year farmers have stored much more grain than normal because of a large crop last year and fewer markets in which to sell soybeans because of a trade dispute with China.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The economy in agriculture is not very good right now. It will end some of these folks farming, family legacies, family farms,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There will be farmers that will be dealing with so much of a negative they won&rsquo;t be able to tolerate it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jorgenson, 43, who has farmed since 1998, reached out to friends Saturday, and they helped him move his grain out of bins to an elevator. Had they not acted, he would have lost $135,000.</p>\n<p>Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has declared a disaster in 41 of Iowa&rsquo;s 99 counties, said she planned to press Vice President Mike Pence for a federal disaster declaration during his stops in Omaha to tour flooded areas along the Missouri River.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It will be helpful for him to see it. I&rsquo;ve reached out, and we&rsquo;ve told him it&rsquo;s catastrophic,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Pence said the Trump administration would expedite presidential disaster declarations for Nebraska and Iowa. He said he spoke to the governors of both states shortly after arriving to assure them federal aid will soon be on the way.</p>\n<p>The flooding is expected to continue throughout the week in several states as high water flows down the Missouri River. Swollen rivers have already breached more than a dozen levees in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, according to the Army Corps of Engineers.</p>\n<p>The flooding, which started after a massive late-winter storm last week, has also put some hog farms in southwest Iowa underwater. The dead animals inside must be disposed of, Reynolds said.</p>\n<p>The water rose so quickly that farmers in many areas had no time to get animals out, said Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Places that haven&rsquo;t seen animal loss have seen a lot of animal stress. That means they&rsquo;re not gaining weight and won&rsquo;t be marketed in as timely a manner, which results in additional cost,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>In all, Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson estimated $400 million of crop losses from fields left unplanted or planted late and up to $500 million in livestock losses.</p>\n<p>In a news release issued Tuesday, Gov. Pete Ricketts said there have been deadlier disasters in Nebraska but never one as widespread. He said 65 of the state&rsquo;s 93 counties are under emergency declarations.</p>\n<p>In neighboring Missouri, water was just shy of getting into Ryonee McCann&rsquo;s home along a recreational lake in Holt County, where about 40,000 acres (16,188 hectares) and hundreds of homes have been flooded. She said her home sits on an 8-foot (2.5-meter) foundation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have no control over it,&rdquo; the 38-year-old said. &ldquo;We just have to wait for the water to recede. It&rsquo;s upsetting because everything you have worked for is there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Missouri River was forecast to crest Thursday morning at 11.6 feet above flood stage in St. Joseph, Missouri, the third highest crest on record. More than 100 roads are closed in the state, including a growing section of Interstate 29.</p>\n<p>Leaders of the small northwestern Missouri town of Craig ordered an evacuation. The Holt County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department said residents who choose to stay must go to City Hall to provide their name and address in case they need to be rescued.</p>\n<p>In nearby Atchison County, Missouri, floodwaters knocked out a larger section of an already busted levee overnight, making the village of Watson unreachable, said Mark Manchester, the county&rsquo;s deputy director of emergency management/911.</p>\n<p>Officials believe everyone got out before thousands of more acres were flooded. But so many roads are now closed that some residents must travel more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) out of their way to get to their jobs at the Cooper Nuclear Station in Nebraska, he said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot harder for people to get around,&rdquo; Manchester said.</p>\n<p>River flooding has also surrounded a northern Illinois neighborhood with water, prompting residents to escape in boats. People living in the Illinois village of Roscoe say children have walked through floodwaters or kayaked to catch school buses.</p>\n<p>Flooding along rivers in western Michigan has damaged dozens of homes and businesses.</p>\n<p><em>Associated Press writers Jim Salter in St. Louis, Margery Beck in Omaha, Nebraska, and Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.</em></p>",

                "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Farmer Jeff Jorgenson looks out over 750 acres of cropland submerged beneath the swollen Missouri River, and he knows he probably won\u2019t plant this year.\nBut that\u2019s not his biggest worry. He and other farmers have worked until midnight for days to move grain, equipment and fuel barrels away from the floodwaters fed by heavy rain and snowmelt. The rising water that has damaged hundreds of homes and been blamed for three deaths has also taken a heavy toll on agriculture, inundating thousands of acres, threatening stockpiled grain and killing livestock.\nIn Fremont County alone, Jorgenson estimates that more than a million bushels of corn and nearly half a million bushels of soybeans have been lost after water overwhelmed grain bins before they could be emptied of last year\u2019s crop. His calculation using local grain prices puts the financial loss at more than $7 million in grain alone. That\u2019s for about 28 farmers in his immediate area, he said.\nOnce it\u2019s deposited in bins, grain is not insured, so it\u2019s just lost money. This year farmers have stored much more grain than normal because of a large crop last year and fewer markets in which to sell soybeans because of a trade dispute with China.\n\u201cThe economy in agriculture is not very good right now. It will end some of these folks farming, family legacies, family farms,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be farmers that will be dealing with so much of a negative they won\u2019t be able to tolerate it.\u201d\nJorgenson, 43, who has farmed since 1998, reached out to friends Saturday, and they helped him move his grain out of bins to an elevator. Had they not acted, he would have lost $135,000.\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has declared a disaster in 41 of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties, said she planned to press Vice President Mike Pence for a federal disaster declaration during his stops in Omaha to tour flooded areas along the Missouri River.\n\u201cIt will be helpful for him to see it. I\u2019ve reached out, and we\u2019ve told him it\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d she said.\nPence said the Trump administration would expedite presidential disaster declarations for Nebraska and Iowa. He said he spoke to the governors of both states shortly after arriving to assure them federal aid will soon be on the way.\nThe flooding is expected to continue throughout the week in several states as high water flows down the Missouri River. Swollen rivers have already breached more than a dozen levees in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, according to the Army Corps of Engineers.\nThe flooding, which started after a massive late-winter storm last week, has also put some hog farms in southwest Iowa underwater. The dead animals inside must be disposed of, Reynolds said.\nThe water rose so quickly that farmers in many areas had no time to get animals out, said Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University.\n\u201cPlaces that haven\u2019t seen animal loss have seen a lot of animal stress. That means they\u2019re not gaining weight and won\u2019t be marketed in as timely a manner, which results in additional cost,\u201d he said.\nIn all, Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson estimated $400 million of crop losses from fields left unplanted or planted late and up to $500 million in livestock losses.\nIn a news release issued Tuesday, Gov. Pete Ricketts said there have been deadlier disasters in Nebraska but never one as widespread. He said 65 of the state\u2019s 93 counties are under emergency declarations.\nIn neighboring Missouri, water was just shy of getting into Ryonee McCann\u2019s home along a recreational lake in Holt County, where about 40,000 acres (16,188 hectares) and hundreds of homes have been flooded. She said her home sits on an 8-foot (2.5-meter) foundation.\n\u201cWe have no control over it,\u201d the 38-year-old said. \u201cWe just have to wait for the water to recede. It\u2019s upsetting because everything you have worked for is there.\u201d\nThe Missouri River was forecast to crest Thursday morning at 11.6 feet above flood stage in St. Joseph, Missouri, the third highest crest on record. More than 100 roads are closed in the state, including a growing section of Interstate 29.\nLeaders of the small northwestern Missouri town of Craig ordered an evacuation. The Holt County Sheriff\u2019s Department said residents who choose to stay must go to City Hall to provide their name and address in case they need to be rescued.\nIn nearby Atchison County, Missouri, floodwaters knocked out a larger section of an already busted levee overnight, making the village of Watson unreachable, said Mark Manchester, the county\u2019s deputy director of emergency management/911.\nOfficials believe everyone got out before thousands of more acres were flooded. But so many roads are now closed that some residents must travel more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) out of their way to get to their jobs at the Cooper Nuclear Station in Nebraska, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder for people to get around,\u201d Manchester said.\nRiver flooding has also surrounded a northern Illinois neighborhood with water, prompting residents to escape in boats. People living in the Illinois village of Roscoe say children have walked through floodwaters or kayaked to catch school buses.\nFlooding along rivers in western Michigan has damaged dozens of homes and businesses.\nAssociated Press writers Jim Salter in St. Louis, Margery Beck in Omaha, Nebraska, and Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.",

Edwin Hardeman, 70, was the second plaintiff to go to trial out of thousands around the country who claim the weed killer causes cancer.</p>\n<p>Monsanto says studies have established that Roundup&rsquo;s active ingredient, glyphosate, is safe.</p>\n<p>A San Francisco jury in August awarded another man $289 million after determining Roundup caused his non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma. A judge later slashed the award to $78 million, and Monsanto has appealed.</p>\n<p>Hardeman&rsquo;s trial is before a different judge and may be more significant. U.S. Judge Vince Chhabria is overseeing hundreds of Roundup lawsuits and has deemed Hardeman&rsquo;s case and two others &ldquo;bellwether trials.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The outcome of such cases can help attorneys decide whether to keep fighting similar lawsuits or settle them. Legal experts said a jury verdict in favor of Hardeman and the other test plaintiffs would give their attorneys a strong bargaining position in any settlement talks for the remaining cases before Chhabria.</p>\n<p>The judge had split Hardeman&rsquo;s trial into two phases. Hardeman&rsquo;s attorneys first had to convince jurors that using Roundup was a significant factor in his cancer before they could make arguments for damages.</p>\n<p>The trial will now proceed to the second phase to determine whether the company is liable and if so, for how much.</p>\n<p>Hardeman declined to comment outside court.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This has been a long time coming for Mr. Hardeman,&rdquo; said one of his attorneys, Jennifer Moore. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very pleased he had his day in court, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to phase two.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Many government regulators have rejected a link between cancer and glyphosate. Monsanto has vehemently denied such a connection, saying hundreds of studies have established that the chemical is safe.</p>\n<p>Bayer, which acquired Monsanto last year, said in a statement after the verdict that it continues to &ldquo;believe firmly that the science confirms glyphosate-based herbicides do not cause cancer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are confident the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto&rsquo;s conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr. Hardeman&rsquo;s cancer,&rdquo; it said.</p>\n<p>Monsanto developed glyphosate in the 1970s, and the weed killer is now sold in more than 160 countries and widely used in the U.S.</p>\n<p>The herbicide came under increasing scrutiny after the France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organization, classified it as a &ldquo;probable human carcinogen&rdquo; in 2015.</p>\n<p>Lawsuits against Monsanto followed. The company has attacked the international research agency&rsquo;s opinion as an outlier.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says glyphosate is safe for people when used in accordance with label directions.</p>\n<p>Hardeman started using Roundup products to treat poison oak, overgrowth and weeds on his Sonoma County property in the 1980s and continued using them through 2012, according to his attorneys. He was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma in 2015.</p>",

                "text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Roundup weed killer was a substantial factor in a California man\u2019s cancer, a jury determined Tuesday in the first phase of a trial that attorneys said could help determine the fate of hundreds of similar lawsuits.\nThe unanimous verdict by the six-person jury in federal court in San Francisco came in a lawsuit filed against Roundup\u2019s manufacturer, agribusiness giant Monsanto. Edwin Hardeman, 70, was the second plaintiff to go to trial out of thousands around the country who claim the weed killer causes cancer.\nMonsanto says studies have established that Roundup\u2019s active ingredient, glyphosate, is safe.\nA San Francisco jury in August awarded another man $289 million after determining Roundup caused his non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. A judge later slashed the award to $78 million, and Monsanto has appealed.\nHardeman\u2019s trial is before a different judge and may be more significant. U.S. Judge Vince Chhabria is overseeing hundreds of Roundup lawsuits and has deemed Hardeman\u2019s case and two others \u201cbellwether trials.\u201d\nThe outcome of such cases can help attorneys decide whether to keep fighting similar lawsuits or settle them. Legal experts said a jury verdict in favor of Hardeman and the other test plaintiffs would give their attorneys a strong bargaining position in any settlement talks for the remaining cases before Chhabria.\nThe judge had split Hardeman\u2019s trial into two phases. Hardeman\u2019s attorneys first had to convince jurors that using Roundup was a significant factor in his cancer before they could make arguments for damages.\nThe trial will now proceed to the second phase to determine whether the company is liable and if so, for how much.\nHardeman declined to comment outside court.\n\u201cThis has been a long time coming for Mr. Hardeman,\u201d said one of his attorneys, Jennifer Moore. \u201cHe\u2019s very pleased he had his day in court, and we\u2019re looking forward to phase two.\u201d\nMany government regulators have rejected a link between cancer and glyphosate. Monsanto has vehemently denied such a connection, saying hundreds of studies have established that the chemical is safe.\nBayer, which acquired Monsanto last year, said in a statement after the verdict that it continues to \u201cbelieve firmly that the science confirms glyphosate-based herbicides do not cause cancer.\u201d\n\u201cWe are confident the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto\u2019s conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr. Hardeman\u2019s cancer,\u201d it said.\nMonsanto developed glyphosate in the 1970s, and the weed killer is now sold in more than 160 countries and widely used in the U.S.\nThe herbicide came under increasing scrutiny after the France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organization, classified it as a \u201cprobable human carcinogen\u201d in 2015.\nLawsuits against Monsanto followed. The company has attacked the international research agency\u2019s opinion as an outlier.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says glyphosate is safe for people when used in accordance with label directions.\nHardeman started using Roundup products to treat poison oak, overgrowth and weeds on his Sonoma County property in the 1980s and continued using them through 2012, according to his attorneys. He was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2015.",

The agency has been led by an acting administrator since January 2018.</p>\n<p>Separately, the Transportation Department confirmed that its watchdog agency will examine how the FAA certified the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, the now-grounded plane involved in two fatal accidents within five months.</p>\n<p>The FAA had stood by the safety of the plane up until last Wednesday, despite other countries grounding it.</p>\n<p>Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao formally requested the audit in a letter sent to Inspector General Calvin Scovel III on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Chao, whose agency oversees the FAA, said the audit will improve the department&rsquo;s decision-making. Her letter confirmed that she had previously requested an audit. It did not mention reports that the inspector general and federal prosecutors are looking into the development and regulatory approval of the jet.</p>\n<p>The letter requests &ldquo;an audit to compile an objective and detailed factual history of the activities that resulted in the certification of the Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft.&rdquo; It also says the audit will help the FAA &ldquo;in ensuring that its safety procedures are implemented effectively.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Boeing said in a statement Tuesday that it will fully cooperate with the audit.</p>\n<p>Questions about the FAA&rsquo;s handling of the issue extend beyond U.S. borders and will pose an immediate challenge for Dickson, if he is confirmed to lead the agency.</p>\n<p>Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau said this week that even if FAA certifies Boeing&rsquo;s fix for the software on the 737 Max jet, &ldquo;we will do our own certification.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dickson was Delta&rsquo;s senior vice president of flight operations until retiring on Oct. 1 after 27 years with the airline, including time flying the 737 and other Boeing jets. Before that, he was an Air Force pilot. He emerged in recent weeks as the likely choice to lead FAA.</p>\n<p>For the past 14 months, the agency has been under an acting administrator, Daniel Elwell, a former Air Force and American Airlines pilot.</p>\n<p>A Lion Air Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed off the coast of Indonesia last October, and an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 crashed this month near Addis Ababa.</p>\n<p>Investigators suspect that incorrect sensor readings feeding into a new automated flight-control system may have played a role in the Indonesian crash, and the Ethiopian plane had a similar, erratic flight path.</p>\n<p>Boeing began working on an upgrade to software behind the flight-control system shortly after the Lion Air crash. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in recent days that the company is close to finishing the update and changes in pilot training to help crews respond to faulty sensor readings.</p>\n<p>Elwell told House Transportation Committee members that Boeing expects the software update to be finished by Monday, according to a person familiar with the briefing who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the timing publicly. The FAA earlier required design changes to the flight-control system &ldquo;no later than April.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After Boeing finishes the software, the FAA still must approve it.</p>\n<p>The Associated Press reported Monday that the Justice Department and the Inspector General are probing development of the Max, according to a person briefed on the matter. It is unclear when those inquiries began.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department and the Transportation Department&rsquo;s inspector general are examining the way Boeing was regulated by the FAA, according to a person familiar with the matter and who asked not to be identified because the inquiry is not public.</p>\n<p>Critics have questioned the FAA&rsquo;s practice of using employees of aircraft manufacturers to handle some safety inspections. FAA inspectors review the work of the manufacturers&rsquo; employees, who are on the company payroll and could face a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury in Washington sent a subpoena to someone involved in the plane&rsquo;s development seeking emails, messages and other communications, the person told The Associated Press.</p>\n<p>A report in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday said the inspector general was looking into the plane&rsquo;s anti-stall system. It quoted unidentified people familiar with both cases.</p>\n<p>The Oct. 29 Lion Air crash killed 189 people, and 157 died in the March 10 accident involving an Ethiopian Airlines jet. Both accidents happened shortly after takeoff.</p>\n<p>Other nations banned the Max 8 and a slightly larger model, the Max 9, in the days after the Ethiopian crash. The FAA and U.S. airlines that use the planes stood by the plane&rsquo;s safety until last week.</p>\n<p>There are about 370 Max jets of various models at airlines around the world. American, Southwest and United have said the grounding of their Max jets have led to some canceled flights.</p>\n<p>The plane is an important part of Chicago-based Boeing&rsquo;s future. The company has taken more than 5,000 orders and delivered more than 250 Max jets last year. Boeing still makes an older version of the popular 737, but it expected the Max to account for 90 percent of all 737 deliveries this year.</p>\n<p><em>Koenig reported from Dallas and Krisher reported from Detroit.

                "text": "President Donald Trump has tapped a former Delta Air Lines executive to lead the Federal Aviation Administration as the regulator deals with questions about its approval of a Boeing airliner involved in two deadly crashes within five months.\nThe White House said Tuesday that Trump will nominate Stephen Dickson to head the FAA. The agency has been led by an acting administrator since January 2018.\nSeparately, the Transportation Department confirmed that its watchdog agency will examine how the FAA certified the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, the now-grounded plane involved in two fatal accidents within five months.\nThe FAA had stood by the safety of the plane up until last Wednesday, despite other countries grounding it.\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao formally requested the audit in a letter sent to Inspector General Calvin Scovel III on Tuesday.\nChao, whose agency oversees the FAA, said the audit will improve the department\u2019s decision-making. Her letter confirmed that she had previously requested an audit. It did not mention reports that the inspector general and federal prosecutors are looking into the development and regulatory approval of the jet.\nThe letter requests \u201can audit to compile an objective and detailed factual history of the activities that resulted in the certification of the Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft.\u201d It also says the audit will help the FAA \u201cin ensuring that its safety procedures are implemented effectively.\u201d\nBoeing said in a statement Tuesday that it will fully cooperate with the audit.\nQuestions about the FAA\u2019s handling of the issue extend beyond U.S. borders and will pose an immediate challenge for Dickson, if he is confirmed to lead the agency.\nCanadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau said this week that even if FAA certifies Boeing\u2019s fix for the software on the 737 Max jet, \u201cwe will do our own certification.\u201d\nDickson was Delta\u2019s senior vice president of flight operations until retiring on Oct. 1 after 27 years with the airline, including time flying the 737 and other Boeing jets. Before that, he was an Air Force pilot. He emerged in recent weeks as the likely choice to lead FAA.\nFor the past 14 months, the agency has been under an acting administrator, Daniel Elwell, a former Air Force and American Airlines pilot.\nA Lion Air Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed off the coast of Indonesia last October, and an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 crashed this month near Addis Ababa.\nInvestigators suspect that incorrect sensor readings feeding into a new automated flight-control system may have played a role in the Indonesian crash, and the Ethiopian plane had a similar, erratic flight path.\nBoeing began working on an upgrade to software behind the flight-control system shortly after the Lion Air crash. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in recent days that the company is close to finishing the update and changes in pilot training to help crews respond to faulty sensor readings.\nElwell told House Transportation Committee members that Boeing expects the software update to be finished by Monday, according to a person familiar with the briefing who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the timing publicly. The FAA earlier required design changes to the flight-control system \u201cno later than April.\u201d\nAfter Boeing finishes the software, the FAA still must approve it.\nThe Associated Press reported Monday that the Justice Department and the Inspector General are probing development of the Max, according to a person briefed on the matter. It is unclear when those inquiries began.\nThe Justice Department and the Transportation Department\u2019s inspector general are examining the way Boeing was regulated by the FAA, according to a person familiar with the matter and who asked not to be identified because the inquiry is not public.\nCritics have questioned the FAA\u2019s practice of using employees of aircraft manufacturers to handle some safety inspections. FAA inspectors review the work of the manufacturers\u2019 employees, who are on the company payroll and could face a conflict of interest.\nA federal grand jury in Washington sent a subpoena to someone involved in the plane\u2019s development seeking emails, messages and other communications, the person told The Associated Press.\nA report in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday said the inspector general was looking into the plane\u2019s anti-stall system. It quoted unidentified people familiar with both cases.\nThe Oct. 29 Lion Air crash killed 189 people, and 157 died in the March 10 accident involving an Ethiopian Airlines jet. Both accidents happened shortly after takeoff.\nOther nations banned the Max 8 and a slightly larger model, the Max 9, in the days after the Ethiopian crash. The FAA and U.S. airlines that use the planes stood by the plane\u2019s safety until last week.\nThere are about 370 Max jets of various models at airlines around the world. American, Southwest and United have said the grounding of their Max jets have led to some canceled flights.\nThe plane is an important part of Chicago-based Boeing\u2019s future. The company has taken more than 5,000 orders and delivered more than 250 Max jets last year. Boeing still makes an older version of the popular 737, but it expected the Max to account for 90 percent of all 737 deliveries this year.\nKoenig reported from Dallas and Krisher reported from Detroit.

It&rsquo;s a move that would not endear her to Utah&rsquo;s GOP establishment but could appeal to voters across the West angered by President Donald Trump&rsquo;s decision to shrink the monuments.</p>\n<aside>  Any Democrat will face an uphill battle to make serious inroads in the reliably conservative state, even though Utah Republican voters tend to be more wary of Trump than others elsewhere. </aside>\n<p>Warren&rsquo;s plan is part of a broader energy proposal that puts her among the few Democratic candidates talking about public lands, a hot topic in the region. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, said in a blog post Monday that shrinking the two expansive Southwestern monuments opens up more land to mining and drilling and could cause &ldquo;irreversible damage.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Republican state leaders have long been deeply frustrated with federal management of the public lands that make up much of the state, and cheered Trump&rsquo;s December 2017 decision that they said would allow more for local control.</p>\n<p>Utah voters, though, are divided on shrinking Bears Ears National Monument by about 85 percent and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by nearly half, said Jason Perry with the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There are passionate feelings on both sides,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Warren&rsquo;s salvo could also signal a wider slice of the field taking up the issue in the run-up to 2020, he said. Any Democrat will face an uphill battle to make serious inroads in the reliably conservative state, even though Utah Republican voters tend to be more wary of Trump than others elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, lawmakers&rsquo; decision to move the state primary several months earlier, to Super Tuesday in March, will likely bring more attention from candidates looking for boost earlier in the election cycle.</p>\n<p>Public lands can also resonate far outside the state: Utah leaders&rsquo; support for the monuments reduction sparked a major outdoor-industry trade show to leave the state for Colorado, and California-based Patagonia joined Native American tribes to sue over scaling back the monument designations meant to protect resources like ancient cliff dwellings.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth Warren is playing to a much larger audience than the state of Utah,&rdquo; Perry said. Other elements of Warren&rsquo;s plan, like a ban on new fossil fuel leasing on public lands and free entry to national parks, could also spark debate.</p>\n<p>There hasn&rsquo;t been any large-scale drilling or mining on the land cut from the Utah monuments yet, though some companies are in the early stages of the permitting process.</p>\n<p>Though it hasn&rsquo;t yet set off an extraction rush, the decision to scale back the monuments sparked anger from left-leaning voters who cheered the original boundaries as bringing more protection, visibility and funding to a unique area, said John Leshy, who served in the Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration and helped create the Grand Staircase National Monument.</p>\n<p>Though public lands may not be a core issue like health care, many voters believe that wide-open spaces are a &ldquo;huge part of the quality of life&rdquo; in the in the region where Democrats have made inroads in recent years, he said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing she&rsquo;s sort of staking this out there as her issue,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see where this goes inside the party as well as the national race.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Elizabeth Warren is headed to Utah on Wednesday after promising to restore broader public lands protections for two of the state\u2019s high-profile national monuments if elected president. It\u2019s a move that would not endear her to Utah\u2019s GOP establishment but could appeal to voters across the West angered by President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to shrink the monuments.\nAny Democrat will face an uphill battle to make serious inroads in the reliably conservative state, even though Utah Republican voters tend to be more wary of Trump than others elsewhere.\nWarren\u2019s plan is part of a broader energy proposal that puts her among the few Democratic candidates talking about public lands, a hot topic in the region. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, said in a blog post Monday that shrinking the two expansive Southwestern monuments opens up more land to mining and drilling and could cause \u201cirreversible damage.\u201d\nRepublican state leaders have long been deeply frustrated with federal management of the public lands that make up much of the state, and cheered Trump\u2019s December 2017 decision that they said would allow more for local control.\nUtah voters, though, are divided on shrinking Bears Ears National Monument by about 85 percent and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by nearly half, said Jason Perry with the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah.\n\u201cThere are passionate feelings on both sides,\u201d he said.\nWarren\u2019s salvo could also signal a wider slice of the field taking up the issue in the run-up to 2020, he said. Any Democrat will face an uphill battle to make serious inroads in the reliably conservative state, even though Utah Republican voters tend to be more wary of Trump than others elsewhere.\nMeanwhile, lawmakers\u2019 decision to move the state primary several months earlier, to Super Tuesday in March, will likely bring more attention from candidates looking for boost earlier in the election cycle.\nPublic lands can also resonate far outside the state: Utah leaders\u2019 support for the monuments reduction sparked a major outdoor-industry trade show to leave the state for Colorado, and California-based Patagonia joined Native American tribes to sue over scaling back the monument designations meant to protect resources like ancient cliff dwellings.\n\u201cElizabeth Warren is playing to a much larger audience than the state of Utah,\u201d Perry said. Other elements of Warren\u2019s plan, like a ban on new fossil fuel leasing on public lands and free entry to national parks, could also spark debate.\nThere hasn\u2019t been any large-scale drilling or mining on the land cut from the Utah monuments yet, though some companies are in the early stages of the permitting process.\nThough it hasn\u2019t yet set off an extraction rush, the decision to scale back the monuments sparked anger from left-leaning voters who cheered the original boundaries as bringing more protection, visibility and funding to a unique area, said John Leshy, who served in the Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration and helped create the Grand Staircase National Monument.\nThough public lands may not be a core issue like health care, many voters believe that wide-open spaces are a \u201chuge part of the quality of life\u201d in the in the region where Democrats have made inroads in recent years, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing she\u2019s sort of staking this out there as her issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see where this goes inside the party as well as the national race.\u201d",

But that company&rsquo;s CEO cited Zinke&rsquo;s &ldquo;excellent relationship&rdquo; with the Bureau of Land Management and the Interior Department in explaining his hiring.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to have Secretary Zinke help move us forward&rdquo; on two pending mining projects, in Nevada and Wyoming, Edward Karr, head of U.S. Gold Corp., said by phone.</p>\n<p>Karr said one of the mining projects is on land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, which is under the Interior Department.</p>\n<p>A 2017 executive order by President Donald Trump says executive-branch appointees cannot lobby their former agency for at least five years after leaving their government post.</p>\n<p>Separately, criminal statutes impose one and two-year bans on various kinds of communications between senior federal officials and their former agency, said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit ethics-watchdog.</p>\n<p>Zinke, who <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/interior-secretary-zinke-resigning-cites-vicious-attacks\">announced his resignation</a> from Interior in December amid ethics investigations, said Tuesday that his new mining job does not violate any prohibitions on post-administration lobbying.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t lobby,&rdquo; Zinke said. &ldquo;I just follow the law, so I don&rsquo;t talk to anybody on the executive side or influence&rdquo; anyone.</p>\n<p>Karr says Zinke will receive a total of $114,000 a year in cash and stock as a board member and under a one-year consulting contract. The company&rsquo;s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission says Zinke will also receive up to $120,000 a year in expenses.</p>\n<p>Zinke said his time in public office would be an asset at the mining company and in &ldquo;making sure the environmental mitigation is done correctly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I understand the process,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s very few former state senators, congressmen and secretaries that know more about the process than I do,&rdquo; said Zinke, who served in the Montana legislature and the U.S. House before being appointed to lead Interior.</p>\n<p>The purpose of federal lobbying freezes by recently departed senior officials is &ldquo;to make sure there there&rsquo;s a cooling-off period &hellip; so the former agency is not subject to the influence of their former head,&rdquo; Canter said.</p>\n<p>Given the restrictions, she said Karr&rsquo;s comment on Zinke&rsquo;s good relationship with Interior &ldquo;just raises questions about what he meant.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Zinke has a degree in geology from the University of Oregon. He never worked professionally in the field, instead becoming a U.S. Navy SEAL. But he said his education and political involvement in Montana mining projects would be useful at U.S. Gold Corp.</p>\n<p><em>Brown reported from Billings, Montana.</em></p>",

But that company\u2019s CEO cited Zinke\u2019s \u201cexcellent relationship\u201d with the Bureau of Land Management and the Interior Department in explaining his hiring.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to have Secretary Zinke help move us forward\u201d on two pending mining projects, in Nevada and Wyoming, Edward Karr, head of U.S. Gold Corp., said by phone.\nKarr said one of the mining projects is on land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, which is under the Interior Department.\nA 2017 executive order by President Donald Trump says executive-branch appointees cannot lobby their former agency for at least five years after leaving their government post.\nSeparately, criminal statutes impose one and two-year bans on various kinds of communications between senior federal officials and their former agency, said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit ethics-watchdog.\nZinke, who announced his resignation from Interior in December amid ethics investigations, said Tuesday that his new mining job does not violate any prohibitions on post-administration lobbying.\n\u201cI don\u2019t lobby,\u201d Zinke said. \u201cI just follow the law, so I don\u2019t talk to anybody on the executive side or influence\u201d anyone.\nKarr says Zinke will receive a total of $114,000 a year in cash and stock as a board member and under a one-year consulting contract. The company\u2019s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission says Zinke will also receive up to $120,000 a year in expenses.\nZinke said his time in public office would be an asset at the mining company and in \u201cmaking sure the environmental mitigation is done correctly.\u201d\n\u201cI understand the process,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s very few former state senators, congressmen and secretaries that know more about the process than I do,\u201d said Zinke, who served in the Montana legislature and the U.S. House before being appointed to lead Interior.\nThe purpose of federal lobbying freezes by recently departed senior officials is \u201cto make sure there there\u2019s a cooling-off period \u2026 so the former agency is not subject to the influence of their former head,\u201d Canter said.\nGiven the restrictions, she said Karr\u2019s comment on Zinke\u2019s good relationship with Interior \u201cjust raises questions about what he meant.\u201d\nZinke has a degree in geology from the University of Oregon. He never worked professionally in the field, instead becoming a U.S. Navy SEAL. But he said his education and political involvement in Montana mining projects would be useful at U.S. Gold Corp.\nBrown reported from Billings, Montana.",

In a phone interview, Tucker said he&rsquo;s &ldquo;95 percent sure&rdquo; that he plans to run for the seat. He said he had no idea how Harris&rsquo; near-endorsement of Rushing would affect the campaign.</p>\n<p>Former U.S. Rep. Robert Pittenger, whom Harris defeated in last May&rsquo;s primary, told The Associated Press in an interview that it was &ldquo;good for the country and the party&rdquo; that Harris wasn&rsquo;t running. When asked why, he said simply: &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s just obvious.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Pittenger again closed the door on seeking his old job, saying he&rsquo;s involved in a series of conferences around the world bringing lawmakers together to discuss counter-terrorism and security issues.</p>\n<p>Former Gov.

His campaign sent out a campaign fundraising plea late Thursday, citing the state elections board&rsquo;s decision.</p>\n<p>McCready formally announced his intention to run Friday before several dozen supporters at a brewery in Waxhaw, near Charlotte.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Folks, there&rsquo;s a lot of people that have had their confidence shaken in recent weeks because of the fraud conducted by Mark Harris&rsquo;s campaign,&rdquo; McCready said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of people right now in North Carolina that are disillusioned in our electoral process.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He told the crowd that he and his team were going to &ldquo;knock on every door&rdquo; in the district to earn votes and to reassure constituents that he&rsquo;s the type of politician who will do the right thing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to talk to people about doing what&rsquo;s right instead of what&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Harris struggled during testimony last week over why he prepared for his primary election last year by seeking out and signing up Bladen County political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless, a convicted felon who had been accused of ballot fraud in the 2016 elections. The state elections board turned over evidence of his actions in 2017 to federal prosecutors, who took no action.</p>\n<p>According to testimony and other findings detailed at the hearing, Dowless conducted an illegal &ldquo;ballot harvesting&rdquo; operation: He and his assistants gathered up absentee ballots from voters by offering to put them in the mail.</p>\n<p>Dowless&rsquo; workers in rural Bladen County testified that they were directed to collect blank or incomplete ballots, forge signatures on them and even fill in votes for local candidates.</p>\n<p>It is generally against the law in North Carolina for anyone other than the voter or a family member to handle someone&rsquo;s completed ballot.</p>\n<p>No criminal charges have been filed in the case. Dowless declined to testify last week after the elections board refused to grant him immunity from prosecution based on what he might say.</p>\n<p><em>Associated Press writers Gary D.

He was previously mayor of Charlotte, a part of which is in the congressional district.\nMcCready has been assembling a new campaign staff and raising money to run again in the district that stretches from Charlotte through several counties to the east along the South Carolina border. His campaign finance report showed McCready raised $487,000 during the final five weeks of 2018. His campaign sent out a campaign fundraising plea late Thursday, citing the state elections board\u2019s decision.\nMcCready formally announced his intention to run Friday before several dozen supporters at a brewery in Waxhaw, near Charlotte.\n\u201cFolks, there\u2019s a lot of people that have had their confidence shaken in recent weeks because of the fraud conducted by Mark Harris\u2019s campaign,\u201d McCready said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people right now in North Carolina that are disillusioned in our electoral process.\u201d\nHe told the crowd that he and his team were going to \u201cknock on every door\u201d in the district to earn votes and to reassure constituents that he\u2019s the type of politician who will do the right thing.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk to people about doing what\u2019s right instead of what\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said.\nHarris struggled during testimony last week over why he prepared for his primary election last year by seeking out and signing up Bladen County political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless, a convicted felon who had been accused of ballot fraud in the 2016 elections. The state elections board turned over evidence of his actions in 2017 to federal prosecutors, who took no action.\nAccording to testimony and other findings detailed at the hearing, Dowless conducted an illegal \u201cballot harvesting\u201d operation: He and his assistants gathered up absentee ballots from voters by offering to put them in the mail.\nDowless\u2019 workers in rural Bladen County testified that they were directed to collect blank or incomplete ballots, forge signatures on them and even fill in votes for local candidates.\nIt is generally against the law in North Carolina for anyone other than the voter or a family member to handle someone\u2019s completed ballot.\nNo criminal charges have been filed in the case. Dowless declined to testify last week after the elections board refused to grant him immunity from prosecution based on what he might say.\nAssociated Press writers Gary D. Robertson and Jonathan Drew contributed to this report.",

In them, officials in the Southern District of New York laid out their suspicions about Cohen, how they planned to investigate and why those warrants were needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Read the original documents below.</strong></p>\n<p>Released months after they were first requested by news organizations, the documents are an early outline of the cases against Cohen, which played out in two separate investigations, one by Mueller&rsquo;s team and another by federal prosecutors in New York. They also point to the cache of evidence the special counsel&rsquo;s office has from Cohen and raise questions about who else may be tainted by it.</p>\n<h2>Was there any new information in the documents?</h2>\n<p>The filings reveal that in July 2017, when Cohen was still <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/02/us/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump.html\">referring to himself</a> as the &ldquo;personal attorney to President Donald J. Trump,&rdquo; the FBI obtained search warrants for Cohen&rsquo;s email. Investigators specifically gained permission to search emails dating back to January 2016.</p>\n<p>That period included the first few months of Trump&rsquo;s presidency, as well as much of the 2016 campaign. Those are also key, disputed months in terms of Trump&rsquo;s personal interest in Russia.</p>\n<p>Michael Cohen recently testified before Congress that Trump continued discussing a possible hotel deal in Russia through the first half of 2016. Cohen had previously testified that the discussions had stopped in early 2016, but later said that was a lie. The White House has repeatedly claimed that Cohen is now an unreliable witness who is inventing stories about Trump in order to gain sympathy in court and reduce his prison time. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to lying to Congress and to several counts of campaign and finance violations.</p>\n<p>Also of interest in the documents: nearly 20 pages devoted to Cohen&rsquo;s &ldquo;illegal campaign contribution scheme,&rdquo; which were entirely redacted by the judge. That is likely a reference to the case in which Cohen pleaded guilty to paying off two women to keep their alleged affairs with Trump silent during Trump&rsquo;s presidential campaign. Cohen has said Trump personally approved of and repaid him as part of that scheme, including making some payments as president in 2017. The White House has repeatedly said Cohen&rsquo;s account is untrue.</p>\n<h2>What did the early stages of the investigation look like?</h2>\n<p>According to the court papers, authorities were eyeing Cohen for multiple crimes, including bank fraud and making illegal campaign contributions in the 2016 cycle.</p>\n<p>A judge approved searches of Cohen&rsquo;s Park Avenue apartment, downtown Manhattan office, a safe deposit box, hotel room and two Apple iPhones &mdash; leading to FBI raids that received significant media coverage last year. But the documents include some interesting details about the searches, such as a note that specifically gave investigators permission to &ldquo;depress the fingerprints and/or thumbprints of Michael Cohen onto [his iPhone] or hold [the iPhone] in front of Cohen&rsquo;s face &hellip; in order to gain access&rdquo;.</p>\n<h2>What&rsquo;s not in the documents?</h2>\n<p>While these are high-profile court papers, they do not substantially add to what we already know about the actions of Cohen or anyone else in the Trump campaign or Trump Organization.</p>\n<p>But the court filings underline one key aspect of Mueller&rsquo;s investigation: The special counsel appears to have far more documents than the public knows about &mdash; and his team has had those documents for a significant amount of time.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/402415696/Unsealed-court-documents-on-Michael-Cohen\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/03/warrant-documents-1200x1549.png\" srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/03/warrant-documents-793x1024.png 793w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/03/warrant-documents-232x300.png 232w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/03/warrant-documents-768x991.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/03/warrant-documents-425x549.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/03/warrant-documents-1200x1549.png 1200w\"></img></a></figure>",

Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to lying to Congress and to several counts of campaign and finance violations.\nAlso of interest in the documents: nearly 20 pages devoted to Cohen\u2019s \u201cillegal campaign contribution scheme,\u201d which were entirely redacted by the judge. That is likely a reference to the case in which Cohen pleaded guilty to paying off two women to keep their alleged affairs with Trump silent during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Cohen has said Trump personally approved of and repaid him as part of that scheme, including making some payments as president in 2017. The White House has repeatedly said Cohen\u2019s account is untrue.\nWhat did the early stages of the investigation look like?\nAccording to the court papers, authorities were eyeing Cohen for multiple crimes, including bank fraud and making illegal campaign contributions in the 2016 cycle.\nA judge approved searches of Cohen\u2019s Park Avenue apartment, downtown Manhattan office, a safe deposit box, hotel room and two Apple iPhones \u2014 leading to FBI raids that received significant media coverage last year. But the documents include some interesting details about the searches, such as a note that specifically gave investigators permission to \u201cdepress the fingerprints and/or thumbprints of Michael Cohen onto [his iPhone] or hold [the iPhone] in front of Cohen\u2019s face \u2026 in order to gain access\u201d.\nWhat\u2019s not in the documents?\nWhile these are high-profile court papers, they do not substantially add to what we already know about the actions of Cohen or anyone else in the Trump campaign or Trump Organization.\nBut the court filings underline one key aspect of Mueller\u2019s investigation: The special counsel appears to have far more documents than the public knows about \u2014 and his team has had those documents for a significant amount of time.",

Activists told the panel that obstacles still remain more than five decades after Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which aimed to eliminate such impediments for minority voters.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There continues to be barriers &mdash; interpersonal and systemic &mdash; at our polling locations in our tribal communities and for our Native voters across the state,&rdquo; said activist Prairie Rose Seminole, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa &amp; Arikara Nation in northwestern North Dakota.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the two-hour hearing focused on North Dakota&rsquo;s voter ID requirements, which have led to two federal lawsuits by tribes who allege the rules are discriminatory and suppress the American Indian vote, which leans Democrat in a Republican-dominant state.</p>\n<p>The voter ID dispute drew national attention last fall because of a U.S. Senate race in North Dakota that was seen as critical to Republicans&rsquo; chances to keep control of the Senate. Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer defeated Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who was seeking a second term.</p>\n<p>North Dakota requires that a voter ID include a provable street address, which Secretary of State Al Jaeger says guards against fraud. Tribes allege the moves by state GOP leaders disenfranchised members who live on reservations where street addresses are uncommon or unknown and where post office boxes are the primary addresses.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The state knew this and they used it to suppress tribal voters,&rdquo; said Charles Walker, CEO of the Mandan, Hidatsa &amp; Arikara Nation.</p>\n<p>State officials have denied that. The U.S. Supreme Court in October allowed the state to continue requiring street addresses on voter IDs, though Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a dissent that &ldquo;the risk of voter confusion appears severe.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The decision led to an intense effort by tribes and advocacy groups to get tribal members to the polls with proper ID during November&rsquo;s general election. It was largely successful but cost the Spirit Lake and Standing Rock tribes a combined $14,000, in part because they waived normal fees for tribal IDs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Fifteen dollars is milk and bread for a week for a poor family,&rdquo; said Turtle Mountain Chippewa attorney Alysia LaCounte, who broke down in tears during her testimony.</p>\n<p>U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican, noted during the hearing that Cramer won handily despite high Native American voter turnout.</p>\n<p>Native American Rights Fund attorney Jacqueline De Leon responded: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think that outrage is a get-out-the-vote strategy, right?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There are voter suppression issues going on throughout Indian Country that aren&rsquo;t nearly getting the attention or resources that were poured into North Dakota because it just so happened that Sen. Heitkamp was running for re-election, and the Senate balance of power elevated this issue to the national stage,&rdquo; DeLeon said.</p>\n<p>Davis replied, &ldquo;So this was all a conspiracy to beat Heidi Heitkamp?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>North Dakota Republican leaders have denied that Heitkamp&rsquo;s surprise 2012 win influenced state voter ID law.</p>\n<p>OJ Semans Sr., co-executive director of the Four Directions advocacy group, which has been successful in voting rights lawsuits in South Dakota and other states, implored the subcommittee to work to increase federal dollars that states can dedicate to helping Native American voters.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The backbone of democracy is going to be given a brace, because people are going to vote,&rdquo; he said.</p>",

Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican, noted during the hearing that Cramer won handily despite high Native American voter turnout.\nNative American Rights Fund attorney Jacqueline De Leon responded: \u201cWe don\u2019t think that outrage is a get-out-the-vote strategy, right?\u201d\n\u201cThere are voter suppression issues going on throughout Indian Country that aren\u2019t nearly getting the attention or resources that were poured into North Dakota because it just so happened that Sen. Heitkamp was running for re-election, and the Senate balance of power elevated this issue to the national stage,\u201d DeLeon said.\nDavis replied, \u201cSo this was all a conspiracy to beat Heidi Heitkamp?\u201d\nNorth Dakota Republican leaders have denied that Heitkamp\u2019s surprise 2012 win influenced state voter ID law.\nOJ Semans Sr., co-executive director of the Four Directions advocacy group, which has been successful in voting rights lawsuits in South Dakota and other states, implored the subcommittee to work to increase federal dollars that states can dedicate to helping Native American voters.\n\u201cThe backbone of democracy is going to be given a brace, because people are going to vote,\u201d he said.",

After nearly two years of speculation over special counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election, a redacted version of his final report is expected to be made public Thursday by Attorney General William Barr.</p>\n<p>Until then, we have just two pieces of real information in our pockets: Barr&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/402973432/AG-March-24-2019-Letter-to-House-and-Senate-Judiciary-Committees#from_embed\">four-page summary</a> of the report&rsquo;s conclusion, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/attorney-general-barr-to-appear-before-house-appropriations-committee-where-he-could-face-questions-on-mueller-report/2019/04/08/57dbc076-5a0f-11e9-9625-01d48d50ef75_story.html?utm_term=.c247c6e5ddd4\">Barr&rsquo;s testimony</a> last week, during which he said he would release as much of the report as legally allowed after redacting certain portions, with color coding to explain the justifications for each redaction.</p>\n<p>While we wait, some things are already clear. Here are key issues to watch for when the report appears, and a suggested list of search terms that could help uncover potential surprises.</p>\n<h3>The four big issues</h3>\n<p>Ahead of the report, four issues loom largest: Russia&rsquo;s election interference, the Trump campaign&rsquo;s activities, and the questions of whether the president obstructed justice &mdash; whether a sitting president can be indicted.</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Obstruction of justice.</strong> Did the president obstruct justice? For many, this is the largest, potentially earth-shaking issue in the report. Barr&rsquo;s summary indicated that Mueller was not able to conclude whether Trump&rsquo;s actions could be construed as obstruction of justice. Instead, the special counsel has laid out arguments on each side. <strong>Look for:</strong> What is the evidence for and against obstruction?</li> <li><strong>Can you indict a sitting president?</strong> Related to the discussion of obstruction, there are heated legal questions about whether the Justice Department can press criminal charges against any sitting president. <strong>Look for:</strong> The supernova issues: Did Mueller determine whether any sitting president can be indicted? Did that influence, or even dictate, his lack of conclusion over whether this president could be prosecuted for obstruction?</li> <li><strong>The Russians.</strong> What did the Russians do to try to influence and manipulate the 2016 election? <strong>Look for:</strong> Extensive discussion of cyber-hacking operations as well as Russian use of social media to distort or amplify specific public sentiment around the 2016 race. Also, pay attention to any direct ties to the Kremlin and Putin.</li> <li><strong>The campaign.</strong> What, if any, interaction did President Donald Trump&rsquo;s campaign have with Russians involved in election interference? Barr&rsquo;s summary states that Mueller&rsquo;s investigation, &ldquo;did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.&rdquo; But that is a limited statement. We do not know the degree to which Russians may have targeted Trump campaign officials and how they handled those interactions. <strong>Look for:</strong> Key campaign-Russia interactions, including the five below.</li> </ul>\n<h3>The five big moments</h3>\n<p>Here are five interactions or events that may be significant in the report.</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Communication between Trump and Jeff Sessions, 2017.</strong> What, if anything, did the president say privately to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the FBI&rsquo;s Russia investigation? And what did Trump say about the firing of FBI Director James Comey? Sessions recused himself from the investigation in March 2017, amid heavy pressure from the president to remain in charge of the probe.

                "text": "Seldom has a report in Washington been so vigorously debated before its release. After nearly two years of speculation over special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election, a redacted version of his final report is expected to be made public Thursday by Attorney General William Barr.\nUntil then, we have just two pieces of real information in our pockets: Barr\u2019s four-page summary of the report\u2019s conclusion, and Barr\u2019s testimony last week, during which he said he would release as much of the report as legally allowed after redacting certain portions, with color coding to explain the justifications for each redaction.\nWhile we wait, some things are already clear. Here are key issues to watch for when the report appears, and a suggested list of search terms that could help uncover potential surprises.\nThe four big issues\nAhead of the report, four issues loom largest: Russia\u2019s election interference, the Trump campaign\u2019s activities, and the questions of whether the president obstructed justice \u2014 whether a sitting president can be indicted.\nObstruction of justice. Did the president obstruct justice? For many, this is the largest, potentially earth-shaking issue in the report. Barr\u2019s summary indicated that Mueller was not able to conclude whether Trump\u2019s actions could be construed as obstruction of justice. Instead, the special counsel has laid out arguments on each side. Look for: What is the evidence for and against obstruction?\nCan you indict a sitting president? Related to the discussion of obstruction, there are heated legal questions about whether the Justice Department can press criminal charges against any sitting president. Look for: The supernova issues: Did Mueller determine whether any sitting president can be indicted? Did that influence, or even dictate, his lack of conclusion over whether this president could be prosecuted for obstruction?\nThe Russians. What did the Russians do to try to influence and manipulate the 2016 election? Look for: Extensive discussion of cyber-hacking operations as well as Russian use of social media to distort or amplify specific public sentiment around the 2016 race. Also, pay attention to any direct ties to the Kremlin and Putin.\nThe campaign. What, if any, interaction did President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign have with Russians involved in election interference? Barr\u2019s summary states that Mueller\u2019s investigation, \u201cdid not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.\u201d But that is a limited statement. We do not know the degree to which Russians may have targeted Trump campaign officials and how they handled those interactions. Look for: Key campaign-Russia interactions, including the five below.\nThe five big moments\nHere are five interactions or events that may be significant in the report.\nCommunication between Trump and Jeff Sessions, 2017. What, if anything, did the president say privately to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation? And what did Trump say about the firing of FBI Director James Comey? Sessions recused himself from the investigation in March 2017, amid heavy pressure from the president to remain in charge of the probe. There are also questions about how Sessions and the president interacted with Russian officials, especially Sergey Kislyak, the former Russian ambassador to the U.S.\nTrump Tower meeting in New York, June 2016. The June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower, which included Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner and a Russian attorney, dominated headlines when it was revealed a year later. Those involved initially said the meeting focused on Russian adoptions or Russian sanctions law, not the campaign. But Donald Trump, Jr., received emails ahead of the meeting promising damaging material on Hillary Clinton. What does Mueller say happened? And did the president know about the Russian offer?\nAir Force One, July 2017. After news of the Trump Tower meeting broke, President Trump, on board Air Force One, dictated a statement for his son to the New York Times. His attorney later admitted the president\u2019s role, despite initially, and repeatedly, denying it. Within days, it was clear that the statement did not describe the meeting fully, though Trump\u2019s attorneys said it was accurate.\nTrump Tower Moscow plan, 2016. There is open debate over how seriously then-candidate Trump pursued what would have been a mega-business deal for a Trump Tower Moscow in 2016. The project is seen as an important indication of potential Trump conflicts of interest and possible attempts to cover them up.\nRepublican National Convention, July 2016. As Republicans gathered to nominate Trump for the presidency, the party made a late change in its platform to water down an anti-Russia stance. Delegates have said this was pushed by the Trump campaign, but Trump officials at the time repeatedly denied it. Kislyak was also at the convention, where he spoke with Sessions and other campaign officials.\n12 key search terms to help guide you through the report\nDonald Trump or the president. How much of the report focuses on the president himself?\nObstruction. The potential crime that Mueller didn\u2019t rule on one way or the other, according to Barr\u2019s summary letter.\nConspiracy. The initial focus of the FBI\u2019s investigation: whether the Trump campaign conspired or colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.\nVladimir Putin or president of Russia. Does the president of Russia appear in the report?\nJames Comey. What did Mueller find or conclude about the president\u2019s firing of and interactions with FBI director James Comey?\nMichael Cohen. Was the president\u2019s former attorney helpful to Mueller? Does Cohen\u2019s allegations of campaign violations appear in the report or does the document push back those public allegations against Trump?\nMichael Flynn. What does the report say about the former national security adviser, who was one of Mueller\u2019s first cooperating witnesses?\nChristopher Steele or dossier. The so-called Steele dossier, a collection of allegations about Trump, sparked some initial FBI suspicion of the Trump campaign but it is seen by others as a fraudulent file meant to undermine him. Does Mueller mention it, or its allegations, at all?\nFacebook. How was the social media giant used and targeted by Russians? And does Mueller point to any flaws in company\u2019s security or policies?\nTwitter or tweet. Did messages on social media, by the president or anyone else, affect Mueller\u2019s investigation?\nVoting machine or state election or election system. To what degree did Russians attempt to, or succeed in, breaking into any voting infrastructure in the states?\nInauguration. Did Mueller write anything about investigations into foreign attempts to donate money to the president\u2019s inauguration?\nReminder: If you want to check what we know currently, our Giant Russia Timeline is a good resource.

Brooks sits down with Judy Woodruff to discuss his personal struggles with social isolation and his choice to be &quot;broken open.&quot;</p>\n<h2>Read the Full Transcript</h2>\n<ul> <li>  <p><strong>Judy Woodruff:</strong></p> <p>As all of us know, life is filled with peaks and valleys.</p><p>Tonight, David Brooks diverges from politics to share a personal journey marked by loneliness and sparked by the inspiration of others who have overcome life-altering obstacles.</p><p>That's the subject of David's latest book, and it's the newest addition to our Bookshelf, &quot;The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life.&quot;</p><p>David Brooks, you have written another book, &quot;The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life.&quot;</p><p>And what you do here is, you say the life that many of us are leading is a life that is self-centered, that this is a moment of transition in our society. What's wrong with what we're doing right now?</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>David Brooks:</strong></p> <p>Yes. This is a book about moral renewal, how individual and societies turn themselves around.</p><p>And it starts with the idea that we have slipped into some bad values. We're too individualistic, when we should be a little more communal. We're too cognitive, up in our head, and analytical, when we should be more emotional and relational. We steer our kids toward career success, and not toward moral joy.</p><p>And when you have bad values, you steer &mdash; you end up in a bad place.

                "text": "In his new book, \"The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life,\" New York Times columnist and NewsHour regular David Brooks explores the current American cultural moment, in which he argues we have become self-centered and cognitive at the expense of joy and community. Brooks sits down with Judy Woodruff to discuss his personal struggles with social isolation and his choice to be \"broken open.\"\nRead the Full Transcript\nJudy Woodruff:\nAs all of us know, life is filled with peaks and valleys.\nTonight, David Brooks diverges from politics to share a personal journey marked by loneliness and sparked by the inspiration of others who have overcome life-altering obstacles.\nThat's the subject of David's latest book, and it's the newest addition to our Bookshelf, \"The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life.\"\nDavid Brooks, you have written another book, \"The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life.\"\nAnd what you do here is, you say the life that many of us are leading is a life that is self-centered, that this is a moment of transition in our society. What's wrong with what we're doing right now?\nDavid Brooks:\nYes. This is a book about moral renewal, how individual and societies turn themselves around.\nAnd it starts with the idea that we have slipped into some bad values. We're too individualistic, when we should be a little more communal. We're too cognitive, up in our head, and analytical, when we should be more emotional and relational. We steer our kids toward career success, and not toward moral joy.\nAnd when you have bad values, you steer \u2014 you end up in a bad place. And that happened to me personally five or six years ago, which was really the start of this book.\nBut I found people who realized the core truth, you can't solve your problems on the level of consciousness at which you created them. They went deeper into themselves. And they discovered a level of ability for care. And they lead marvelous lives.\nJudy Woodruff:\nHow did you know that this new kind of living, this second mountain, as you describe it, is the answer?\nDavid Brooks:\nWell, I went through a bad period in 2013.\nMy kids were \u2014 gone away to college or going. My marriage had ended. A lot of my friendships were in the conservative movement, but I wasn't that kind of conservative anymore, so a lot of my friendships went away.\nAnd so I was living alone in an apartment. And I had valued time over people. I had valued productivity over relationship. So I didn't have a lot of weekend friends. I had workday friends that were professional, but not weekend friends.\nAnd I had vast stretches of loneliness. If you went to my drawers, where there used to be \u2014 where there should have been silverware in the kitchen, I had Post-it notes. Where there should have been plates, I had stationery, because I was just working. I was using workaholism as therapy for an emotional and spiritual problem.\nSo, I was down in the valley. And I went through that period. And I discovered you can either be broken or you can be broken open. And some people get broken. They turn fearful in their bad moments, and they lash out. They turn hostile and violent and tribal. And they're full of resentments.\nBut some people get broken open. You just realize the depths of yourself, and you realize that only spiritual and emotional food is going to fill those depths. So, you think, I got to change my world view.\nSo, I spent five years looking at people who had done it and trying to learn from them.\nJudy Woodruff:\nYou have a number of observations in here.\nOne of them that struck me, \"Our society has become a conspiracy against joy.\"\nDavid Brooks:\nOne of the things I really discovered in the course of this process was that it's useful to make a distinction between happiness and joy.\nWe spend a lot of time thinking about happiness. And happiness is when you win your victory, when something goes well, you got a promotion. And happiness is an expansion of self.\nBut joy is when the self disappears, when you transcend yourself. There's a woman in the book who I interviewed in Ohio who the worst thing happened to her that could happen. She came home one Sunday, and her husband had killed their kids and himself.\nAnd now she leads a life of pure service, pure gift. She has a free pharmacy. She teaches at Ohio University. She helps women who've suffered violence. And she said: \"I did it partly out of anger. I wanted to show, whatever that guy tried to do to me, he didn't do it. I was going to make a difference in the world.\"\nAnd so there is anger there, but there's also the joy of self-giving.\nJudy Woodruff:\nIs this a prescription for everybody? Does it work for people who are struggling just to get by?\nDavid Brooks:\nYes, I think it works for everybody.\nI have been with rich people and poor people, and everybody needs spiritual growth. Everybody has a soul. It gives us infinite value and dignity. And what the soul does is, it yearns for righteousness.\nIn our business, we cover a lot of bad people in wars, crime, genocide. I have never met anybody who didn't want to be good. And I didn't \u2014 never met anybody whose life didn't fall apart if they thought they were leading a bad and meaningless life.\nAnd so, on that level of soul, we all need to feed the yearning to be good, to try to be a good person.\nJudy Woodruff:\nHow do you relate all this to what's going on in our country right now, in our politics? How does it connect to that?\nDavid Brooks:\nYes.\nI think, at bottom, the Trump moment is a spiritual and moral crisis. We just treat each other badly. We're not compassionate towards one another. We stereotype, rather than see the dignity of each human person.\nAnd I think it flows out of loneliness and disconnection. A lot of people who voted for him, their communities are falling apart. And they needed something new.\nAnd then we're in a tribal warfare where we don't communicate with each other well, we don't see deeply into each other's souls, we don't befriend one another. And so we get this volleys of hatred.\nAnd so, to me, our problems are, we have political problems, we have economic problems, but we also have spiritual and moral problems. And we have become not great about talking about them, because it always seems like, oh, you're the problem. We don't live for relationship. And that's the change that has to happen.\nDavid Brooks:\nI physically wear this little pin on my lapel occasionally from time to time on the \"NewsHour.\"\nI started something called \u2014 at the Aspen Institute called Weave: The Social Fabric Project. And I meet weavers wherever you go. And these are people who are weaving relationship. They are weaving community.\nI met a woman named Lisa Fitzpatrick in New Orleans. She was driving. She turned and saw a two \u2014 10 \u2014 a 10- and 11-year-old boy looking terrified. The boys held up a gun and they shot her in the face. And it was their gang initiation thing. And she said: \"I wasn't the victim and they weren't the victims. We were trapped in this war that started long before us.\"\nSo, she gave herself and \u2014 she quit her job as a health care executive. She works with gang members. She works with community members. And now she too has one of these second families, where kids just show up at her home. They knock on the door. They're a bunch of \u2014 40 17-year-olds hanging around this 55-year-old woman. And she says: \"Why are you hanging around with me?\" And they say: \"Because we knocked on the door. You opened it.\"\nAnd so that longing for community \u2014 these Weavers are leading us into a better future. My basic theory of social change is that culture changes when a small group of people find a better way to live, and the rest of us copy them.\nAnd these weavers have found a better way to live. And I wear this to celebrate them and to illuminate them and hope they can lead us to a better future.\nJudy Woodruff:\nWell, the book is definitely worth reading. It's worth talking about, reflecting on, \"The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life,\" looking for a better way.\nDavid Brooks, thank you.",

He is a businessman with close ties to the Kremlin.</p><p>&quot;NewsHour&quot; special correspondent Ryan Chilcote landed a rare interview with him.</p><p>He starts with some background.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Ryan Chilcote:</strong></p> <p>He is a self-made tycoon, one of Russia's wealthiest businessmen, who controlled, for years, one of the world's largest aluminum producers, Rusal, and a number of the nation's industrial giants, employing hundreds of thousands of Russians.</p><p>Like other Russian magnates, the U.S. government says Oleg Deripaska is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin. Over the last two years, Deripaska's name has come up in American news reports as a figure with ties to some of the targets of special counsel Robert Mueller's now concluded Russia investigation.</p><p>Deripaska's interactions with the eventual chairman of President Trump's 2016 campaign, Paul Manafort, go back years. More recently, Deripaska and Manafort came into a financial dispute, with Deripaska charging that Manafort owes him millions of dollars.</p><p>In an e-mail revealed by The Washington Post by an associate by the name of Konstantin Kilimnik, who the U.S. believes has ties to Russian intelligence, Manafort even considered on his own whether to give Deripaska private briefings about the campaign.</p><p>Last year, the U.S. slapped sanctions on Deripaska and his company. At the time, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the aim was to hit at the Russian government. While the sanctions against Deripaska remain, they have been lifted from some of his largest holdings, after Deripaska agreed to reduce his stake and control in the firm.</p><p>And where are you going now?</p><p>Today, I sat down with Deripaska in Nizhny Novgorod, home to GAZ, Russia's largest maker of commercial vehicles, a company still under American sanctions.</p><p>Do you feel that the attorney general's summary of the Mueller report has exonerated you?</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Oleg Deripaska:</strong></p> <p>I never felt guilty. I'm not a subject, first of all, as you know.</p><p>But, in my view, it was so bizarre to claim that Russia made any important role in those elections.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Ryan Chilcote:</strong></p> <p>We know from the court document the special counsel has laid out pretty extensive evidence that Russia did interfere in the election, not just in the digital landscape, but in real ways, by organizing protests.</p><p>The evidence that they have already laid out in various court filings is pretty convincing, no?</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Oleg Deripaska:</strong></p> <p>I don't believe in this, to be honest. I live in Russia. I know what Russian state capable, know Russian bureaucrats capable.</p><p>I just don't believe that they're so sophisticated to be part of it. Just don't believe it. If they're so sophisticated, why we have such a bad economic situation?</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Ryan Chilcote:</strong></p> <p>If you're such a believer in Mueller and the process of justice, why didn't you &mdash; when the special counsel sent you written questions, why didn't you answer the questions?</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Oleg Deripaska:</strong></p> <p>It was advice from my lawyer. He just said to me, don't bother. They will settle this thing without you.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Ryan Chilcote:</strong></p> <p>That's an easy way out.</p><p>Then why wouldn't you just say, I have absolutely nothing to hide, I'm happy to talk to you, here are my answers?</p><p>I don't understand.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Oleg Deripaska:</strong></p> <p>First of all, I have my right to do so.</p><p>And second, when I saw the list of question, some question I had nothing to do with, they were very preposterous, and, as I said, my lawyer just said, don't bother.</p>  </li>        <li>  <p><strong>Oleg Deripaska:</strong></p> <p>It's all a lie.</p><p>And wait a second. First of all (INAUDIBLE) produces list of 100. And you have quite a lot of experience in Russia. Do you really believe that all 100 people, as you said, how you said, close, part of this Mueller activity?</p><p>They just put trade in all Russian private business. Do you really believing they're all guilty in something?</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Ryan Chilcote:</strong></p> <p>President Trump has repeatedly said he believes President Putin when President Putin says Russia didn't interfere in the election.</p><p>Do Russians appreciate those kind of comments from the U.S. president?</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Oleg Deripaska:</strong></p> <p>I think they don't care, to be honest. And, at this moment, Russia more cares about the economic situation in Russia.</p>  </li>  <li>  <p><strong>Oleg Deripaska:</strong></p> <p>No, it's a stalemate. Russian economy not growing. There is, of course, no surplus in the Russian budget because of oil, and &mdash; but it's a Russian budget. It's a state, bureaucrats.</p><p>Ordinary people feel a lot of pressure. Russia is a part of global economy. And when you U.S. tried to weaponize on wrong &mdash; on ill-advised, their financial system, of course, Russia is a weak player in this case. The cost of that opportunity to attract capital, everything has been affected.</p><p>When you use it, you know, like in the case of this factory, what on earth brought anyone to believe that (INAUDIBLE) 40,000 people who work here and 300,000 who supply them, it will affect Russian foreign policy? It's a private factory. What would change?</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Ryan Chilcote:</strong></p> <p>The argument, as you know, is that it's a private factory owned by you, and that, if you're close to the Kremlin, and the Kremlin obviously relies on the taxes that this factory could bring, or does bring, that that could change the Kremlin's behavior.</p>  </li>   <li>  <p><strong>Oleg Deripaska:</strong></p> <p>Yes, nice.</p><p>But if it's wrong, and if this factory goes bankrupt, if me and other investors will &mdash; lost everything, without any proof that this may affect this way, as you describe. First of all, it's stupid to believe that something like this could change Russian government behavior, just stupid. It's just another confirmation how far are you from reality.</p>  </li>      <li>  <p><strong>Oleg Deripaska:</strong></p> <p>I just look at my shelves. What they be worth now what they're worth? Look at the opportunity which has been lost even on this side (INAUDIBLE) stopped working. We have an assembly facility here, and 3,000 people, 3.2 thousand people &mdash; 3,200, already lost their jobs.</p>  </li>     <li>  <p><strong>Ryan Chilcote:</strong></p> <p>On July 7, two weeks before President Trump accepted the Republican nomination, Manafort sent an e-mail to Konstantin Kilimnik, where he said: &quot;If he needs private briefings, we can accommodate.&quot;</p><p>The he in that e-mail is you. And the private briefings were to be about President Trump's then campaign.</p>  </li>   <li>  <p><strong>Oleg Deripaska:</strong></p> <p>No, but after what has happened with all this Mueller investigation, it's quite a &mdash; quite an old story.</p><p>I never met Kilimnik. Again, Manafort and others from this team, almost 10 years, work on Ukraine. I tried to sue him, and my lawyers were looking for him almost two years, couldn't find him, you know, for those two project which he failed to perform.</p><p>And, actually, my lawyers suspect it's more than just failure to perform. And do you believe that, after all of this, he will offer me some kind of gesture of something?</p>  </li>             </ul>",

Russia is a part of global economy. And when you U.S. tried to weaponize on wrong \u2014 on ill-advised, their financial system, of course, Russia is a weak player in this case. The cost of that opportunity to attract capital, everything has been affected.\nWhen you use it, you know, like in the case of this factory, what on earth brought anyone to believe that (INAUDIBLE) 40,000 people who work here and 300,000 who supply them, it will affect Russian foreign policy? It's a private factory. What would change?\nRyan Chilcote:\nThe argument, as you know, is that it's a private factory owned by you, and that, if you're close to the Kremlin, and the Kremlin obviously relies on the taxes that this factory could bring, or does bring, that that could change the Kremlin's behavior.\nOleg Deripaska:\nYes, nice.\nBut if it's wrong, and if this factory goes bankrupt, if me and other investors will \u2014 lost everything, without any proof that this may affect this way, as you describe. First of all, it's stupid to believe that something like this could change Russian government behavior, just stupid. It's just another confirmation how far are you from reality.\nOleg Deripaska:\nI just look at my shelves. What they be worth now what they're worth? Look at the opportunity which has been lost even on this side (INAUDIBLE) stopped working. We have an assembly facility here, and 3,000 people, 3.2 thousand people \u2014 3,200, already lost their jobs.\nRyan Chilcote:\nOn July 7, two weeks before President Trump accepted the Republican nomination, Manafort sent an e-mail to Konstantin Kilimnik, where he said: \"If he needs private briefings, we can accommodate.\"\nThe he in that e-mail is you. And the private briefings were to be about President Trump's then campaign.\nOleg Deripaska:\nNo, but after what has happened with all this Mueller investigation, it's quite a \u2014 quite an old story.\nI never met Kilimnik. Again, Manafort and others from this team, almost 10 years, work on Ukraine. I tried to sue him, and my lawyers were looking for him almost two years, couldn't find him, you know, for those two project which he failed to perform.\nAnd, actually, my lawyers suspect it's more than just failure to perform. And do you believe that, after all of this, he will offer me some kind of gesture of something?",

Meanwhile, Vice President Pence traveled to Colombia to meet with opposition leader Juan Guaido, promising that the U.S. would increase sanctions on Venezuela in an attempt to oust President Maduro, and calling for other countries to do the same. Special correspondent Nadja Drost reports.</p>\n<h2>Read the Full Transcript</h2>\n<ul> <li>  <p><strong>Judy Woodruff:</strong></p> <p>As we reported, Vice President Pence was in Colombia today to press the case against Nicolas Maduro, the man in charge of Colombia's starving neighbor to the east, Venezuela.</p><p>Confrontations on the border between the countries erupted this past weekend, as what was a political fight over humanitarian aid became violent. At least three people were killed and hundreds were wounded.</p><p>With support of the Pulitzer Center, special correspondent Nadja Drost and videographer Bruno Federico have been reporting from Venezuela for us for the past two weeks. And they were in Urena &mdash; that is Venezuela &mdash; on Saturday. It's become the focal point of the struggle between Maduro and Juan Guaido, the opposition National Assembly leader, which the U.S. recognizes as the rightful president of Venezuela.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Nadja Drost:</strong></p> <p>The town of Urena on the border with Colombia was the front line on Saturday in the battle between the two leaders for control of Venezuela. And the weapon of choice, humanitarian aid.</p><p>For the so-called Women in White, pacifist demonstrators who've helped lead protests throughout the country, their mission was clear.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Claudia Perez:</strong></p> <p>The plan today is to reach the heart of the military. If the military don't consent, if they don't see in us the reflection of their mothers, daughters, wives, of whoever suffers, we will have to use force.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Nadja Drost:</strong></p> <p>They're following a plan devised by the man they now consider their president, Juan Guaido, who is trying to peel away support of President Nicolas Maduro from the military to allow aid into the country.</p><p>And that meant going up against the national guard, military and police sent in the hundreds to guard the three bridges.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Claudia Perez:</strong></p> <p>We have had so much taken away from us, to the point that we don't have fear.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Nadja Drost:</strong></p> <p>But the Women in White had little chance to make it to the heavily guarded bridge. By early morning, clashes had already broken out between protesters and the national guard.</p><p>Protesters want to make their way onto the bridge that crosses the river into Colombia, but the national guard has been blockading all groups from access. And as they have been coming up from the bridge, protesters are meeting them. There's been an exchange of Molotov cocktails and rocks from one side and tear gas from the other.</p><p>No matter what happens, protesters here today say they will find a way to break the blockade of the national guard in order to allow humanitarian aid from Colombia to pass the border into Venezuela.</p><p>Among them was a member of the opposition-held National Assembly, Joaquin Aguilar.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Joaquin Aguilar:</strong></p> <p>The goal is to reach the bridge and allow the entrance of humanitarian aid, to break the barrier of repression that the regime of Nicolas Maduro is imposing on the Venezuelan people.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Nadja Drost:</strong></p> <p>As the national guard took to the streets and started firing at protesters with rubber bullets, many of them were rescued by mobile units of volunteer nurses and brought to the nearest safe house, before being transferred to this private health clinic opening its doors to anyone injured.</p><p>By noon, volunteer doctor Solaris Medina reported 40 injuries of protesters, all by rubber bullets. By end of day, the tally had reached 150 for that clinic alone.</p><p>On the Colombian side of that bridge, one truck carrying American-donated aid inched into Venezuelan territory before it burst into flames. It was unclear how the fire started, but opposition leader Juan Guaido blamed Maduro for the fire, the searing image the latest in what has become a violent fight over aid in the country.</p><p>While the opposition blames Maduro for not allowing shipments of food and health supplies donated by the U.S., seen by the Maduro's government as their number one enemy, the government says the effort to force in aid is a form of foreign intervention and threat to sovereignty.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Ernesto Villegas:</strong></p> <p>If a person wants to bring across goods, they have to be subject to inspection by authorities. What can not be permitted &mdash; no country would do this, least of all the U.S. &mdash; is to open a passage, and open the way to whatever may be.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Nadja Drost:</strong></p> <p>After Guaido declared himself president on January 23, the military didn't rally to his side, as he hoped. Aid then became a mechanism to force the military into a corner: Either disobey Maduro and let the aid pass, or prevent it with the repressive tactics the government is known for.</p><p>While the Venezuelan Red Cross has offered to administer whatever aid is in the country, it has refused to participate in an operation where alleged political motivations eclipse humanitarian ones.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Luis Farias:</strong></p> <p>If we participate in an activity of politicized aid, we are straying from our fundamental principles. The trust that we are acting with impartiality and independence are the principles that guarantee us access to communities.</p>  </li>   <li>  <p><strong>Nadja Drost:</strong></p> <p>Following the outbreak of violence on the border, Guaido was in Bogota today with Vice President Pence at a meeting of regional nations, almost all of which have demanded Maduro leave.</p><p>Jesus Faria, a member of Maduro's government party, said this is the latest in a long string of U.S. provocations.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Jesus Faria:</strong></p> <p>When they talk about dialogue, the only dialogue there is that President Nicolas Maduro should go. First it's said in the United States, and then it's said here.</p><p>What is the justification? We don't want to prolong the suffering of Venezuelans? But you're ready for there to be war and a military intervention? That doesn't generate suffering?</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Nadja Drost:</strong></p> <p>Earlier this month, President Donald Trump announced a new series of broad sanctions against Venezuela that included tough measures against the country's all-important oil industry, asset seizures and export sanctions that could cost it $11 billion in lost oil revenue.</p><p>Despite offers of aid from the U.S., the sanctions are expected to nearly obliterate the country's ability to import much-needed food and medication. Hyperinflation has meant that average Venezuelans can't afford to buy medication, driving this woman to beg for antibiotics on a Caracas roadside.</p><p>Her son has spina bifida and club foot. Once able to get medication, now she needs any help she can get. And her needs supersede politics.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Mirella Morena:</strong></p> <p>What I think is, my mind is totally blocked. I don't speak, say anything, give my opinion. And I can't say I won't receive help. I always accept whatever help I get.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Nadja Drost:</strong></p> <p>Maduro continues to deny a humanitarian crisis, but it is clear that Venezuelans are in dire need of food.</p><p>Inside the public hospital in the border town of San Antonio del Tachira, the corridors and rooms are largely empty. Patients either don't come because they know the hospital can't to treat them, or they cross into Colombia.</p><p>Dr. William Bahoque shows entire units of the hospital that have been closed.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Dr. William Bahoque:</strong></p> <p>A lot of patients arrive in a serious state, and they die on the way here because even the ambulances aren't properly equipped to attend to a patient in a grave state. And, then here, a lot of people die because we don't have the necessary equipment, nor medical supplies to stabilize them.</p>  </li>     <li>  <p><strong>Nadja Drost:</strong></p> <p>Edwin Perez and his family traveled over 24 hours to arrive at this vital crossing. As a bus driver, along with his wife, a nurse, they can't make ends meet. This family may make their way to Peru, but they have no idea where to go after they cross the bridge.</p><p>Edwin's wife, Niurys Yeguez:</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Niurys Yeguez:</strong></p> <p>We are risking practically everything. We left it all behind, our house, our work, our car. Just to leave everything suddenly because you can't get what you need, it's so upsetting.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Nadja Drost:</strong></p> <p>One day after their crossing, Maduro closed all land borders, leaving other families who could not flee with no options.</p><p>For the &quot;PBS NewsHour,&quot; reporting with Bruno Federico, I'm Nadja Drost in Urena, Venezuela.</p>  </li> </ul>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/february-25-2019-pbs-newshour-full-episode\">   Watch   <img alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/02/Main15-768x510.jpg\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/02/Main15-768x510.jpg\"></img> </a></figure>",

Meanwhile, Vice President Pence traveled to Colombia to meet with opposition leader Juan Guaido, promising that the U.S. would increase sanctions on Venezuela in an attempt to oust President Maduro, and calling for other countries to do the same. Special correspondent Nadja Drost reports.\nRead the Full Transcript\nJudy Woodruff:\nAs we reported, Vice President Pence was in Colombia today to press the case against Nicolas Maduro, the man in charge of Colombia's starving neighbor to the east, Venezuela.\nConfrontations on the border between the countries erupted this past weekend, as what was a political fight over humanitarian aid became violent. At least three people were killed and hundreds were wounded.\nWith support of the Pulitzer Center, special correspondent Nadja Drost and videographer Bruno Federico have been reporting from Venezuela for us for the past two weeks. And they were in Urena \u2014 that is Venezuela \u2014 on Saturday. It's become the focal point of the struggle between Maduro and Juan Guaido, the opposition National Assembly leader, which the U.S. recognizes as the rightful president of Venezuela.\nNadja Drost:\nThe town of Urena on the border with Colombia was the front line on Saturday in the battle between the two leaders for control of Venezuela. And the weapon of choice, humanitarian aid.\nFor the so-called Women in White, pacifist demonstrators who've helped lead protests throughout the country, their mission was clear.\nClaudia Perez:\nThe plan today is to reach the heart of the military. If the military don't consent, if they don't see in us the reflection of their mothers, daughters, wives, of whoever suffers, we will have to use force.\nNadja Drost:\nThey're following a plan devised by the man they now consider their president, Juan Guaido, who is trying to peel away support of President Nicolas Maduro from the military to allow aid into the country.\nAnd that meant going up against the national guard, military and police sent in the hundreds to guard the three bridges.\nClaudia Perez:\nWe have had so much taken away from us, to the point that we don't have fear.\nNadja Drost:\nBut the Women in White had little chance to make it to the heavily guarded bridge. By early morning, clashes had already broken out between protesters and the national guard.\nProtesters want to make their way onto the bridge that crosses the river into Colombia, but the national guard has been blockading all groups from access. And as they have been coming up from the bridge, protesters are meeting them. There's been an exchange of Molotov cocktails and rocks from one side and tear gas from the other.\nNo matter what happens, protesters here today say they will find a way to break the blockade of the national guard in order to allow humanitarian aid from Colombia to pass the border into Venezuela.\nAmong them was a member of the opposition-held National Assembly, Joaquin Aguilar.\nJoaquin Aguilar:\nThe goal is to reach the bridge and allow the entrance of humanitarian aid, to break the barrier of repression that the regime of Nicolas Maduro is imposing on the Venezuelan people.\nNadja Drost:\nAs the national guard took to the streets and started firing at protesters with rubber bullets, many of them were rescued by mobile units of volunteer nurses and brought to the nearest safe house, before being transferred to this private health clinic opening its doors to anyone injured.\nBy noon, volunteer doctor Solaris Medina reported 40 injuries of protesters, all by rubber bullets. By end of day, the tally had reached 150 for that clinic alone.\nOn the Colombian side of that bridge, one truck carrying American-donated aid inched into Venezuelan territory before it burst into flames. It was unclear how the fire started, but opposition leader Juan Guaido blamed Maduro for the fire, the searing image the latest in what has become a violent fight over aid in the country.\nWhile the opposition blames Maduro for not allowing shipments of food and health supplies donated by the U.S., seen by the Maduro's government as their number one enemy, the government says the effort to force in aid is a form of foreign intervention and threat to sovereignty.\nErnesto Villegas:\nIf a person wants to bring across goods, they have to be subject to inspection by authorities. What can not be permitted \u2014 no country would do this, least of all the U.S. \u2014 is to open a passage, and open the way to whatever may be.\nNadja Drost:\nAfter Guaido declared himself president on January 23, the military didn't rally to his side, as he hoped. Aid then became a mechanism to force the military into a corner: Either disobey Maduro and let the aid pass, or prevent it with the repressive tactics the government is known for.\nWhile the Venezuelan Red Cross has offered to administer whatever aid is in the country, it has refused to participate in an operation where alleged political motivations eclipse humanitarian ones.\nLuis Farias:\nIf we participate in an activity of politicized aid, we are straying from our fundamental principles. The trust that we are acting with impartiality and independence are the principles that guarantee us access to communities.\nNadja Drost:\nFollowing the outbreak of violence on the border, Guaido was in Bogota today with Vice President Pence at a meeting of regional nations, almost all of which have demanded Maduro leave.\nJesus Faria, a member of Maduro's government party, said this is the latest in a long string of U.S. provocations.\nJesus Faria:\nWhen they talk about dialogue, the only dialogue there is that President Nicolas Maduro should go. First it's said in the United States, and then it's said here.\nWhat is the justification? We don't want to prolong the suffering of Venezuelans? But you're ready for there to be war and a military intervention? That doesn't generate suffering?\nNadja Drost:\nEarlier this month, President Donald Trump announced a new series of broad sanctions against Venezuela that included tough measures against the country's all-important oil industry, asset seizures and export sanctions that could cost it $11 billion in lost oil revenue.\nDespite offers of aid from the U.S., the sanctions are expected to nearly obliterate the country's ability to import much-needed food and medication. Hyperinflation has meant that average Venezuelans can't afford to buy medication, driving this woman to beg for antibiotics on a Caracas roadside.\nHer son has spina bifida and club foot. Once able to get medication, now she needs any help she can get. And her needs supersede politics.\nMirella Morena:\nWhat I think is, my mind is totally blocked. I don't speak, say anything, give my opinion. And I can't say I won't receive help. I always accept whatever help I get.\nNadja Drost:\nMaduro continues to deny a humanitarian crisis, but it is clear that Venezuelans are in dire need of food.\nInside the public hospital in the border town of San Antonio del Tachira, the corridors and rooms are largely empty. Patients either don't come because they know the hospital can't to treat them, or they cross into Colombia.\nDr. William Bahoque shows entire units of the hospital that have been closed.\nDr. William Bahoque:\nA lot of patients arrive in a serious state, and they die on the way here because even the ambulances aren't properly equipped to attend to a patient in a grave state. And, then here, a lot of people die because we don't have the necessary equipment, nor medical supplies to stabilize them.\nNadja Drost:\nEdwin Perez and his family traveled over 24 hours to arrive at this vital crossing. As a bus driver, along with his wife, a nurse, they can't make ends meet. This family may make their way to Peru, but they have no idea where to go after they cross the bridge.\nEdwin's wife, Niurys Yeguez:\nNiurys Yeguez:\nWe are risking practically everything. We left it all behind, our house, our work, our car. Just to leave everything suddenly because you can't get what you need, it's so upsetting.\nNadja Drost:\nOne day after their crossing, Maduro closed all land borders, leaving other families who could not flee with no options.\nFor the \"PBS NewsHour,\" reporting with Bruno Federico, I'm Nadja Drost in Urena, Venezuela.",

Under the new restrictions, any clinic accepting federal funds would be prevented from performing abortions -- or referring women to other providers for the procedure. William Brangham talks to Doreen Denny of Concerned Women for America, who supports the new policy.</p>\n<h2>Read the Full Transcript</h2>\n<ul> <li>  <p><strong>Judy Woodruff:</strong></p> <p>A new rule from the Trump administration would change what kinds of family planning clinics can receive federal funding. It is being celebrated by conservative anti-abortion groups and raising alarms among abortion rights organizations. William Brangham explains:</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>William Brangham:</strong></p> <p>The rule change involves Title X, the federal program providing birth control and reproductive health care to an estimated four million low-income women.</p><p>The new rule says any group receiving Title X money has to be physically and financially separate from any group that provides or refers women for abortions. Currently, those funds can't be used to provide abortions, but they can go to organizations that offer the procedure.</p><p>Critics contend this rule would essentially zero out groups like Planned Parenthood. The administration and conservative groups counter that they simply want to support centers that put greater emphasis on natural family planning and abstinence counseling.</p><p>We start with first of two views.</p><p>Doreen Denny is senior director of government relations for Concerned Women of America.</p><p>Welcome to the &quot;NewsHour.&quot;</p>  </li>  <li>  <p><strong>William Brangham:</strong></p> <p>So, I know your organization was strongly supportive of this rule change. Why do you think it's a good idea?</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Doreen Denny:</strong></p> <p>Well, it's important to realize the Title 10 program from inception made was very clear that abortion is not a method of family planning.</p><p>And so this rule is just another opportunity to make that statutory reality &mdash; restriction a reality. And I think it's important that people understand that the family planning program, the contraception, the education, the other screenings, the other things that are really important for women and for low-income women, for any woman, will continue to be the &mdash; really the bedrock of what this is all about.</p><p>And so we're now going to be in a place where organizations that may have commingled those activities are going to have to make a choice.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>William Brangham:</strong></p> <p>I mean, the main organization you're talking about here is Planned Parenthood.</p><p>They'd argue that this is an attempt to zero them out. And they argue that what happens to all the other services that they provide in communities with lots of low-income women? Are there enough groups that could fill the gap if they suddenly have to go away? Do you worry that that's a possible concern?</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Doreen Denny:</strong></p> <p>Well, I don't worry, because, right now, we have federally qualified health centers all over the country that could be a part of this program and do provide services through the Title X program.</p><p>We have other organizations that have applied. And maybe they haven't been the ones that have been selected, but are just as qualified. Remember, this is a small amount of federal dollars, you know, considering the amount of health services that go out for family planning in communities, whether through the states or other organizations.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>William Brangham:</strong></p> <p>Do you think that organizations &mdash; some of the organizations you're describing might be these so-called crisis pregnancy centers, which really try to talk women out of having an abortion.</p><p>Do you think that those organizations should have access to federal money?</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Doreen Denny:</strong></p> <p>Well, I think that it's important that all types of providers that want to serve women and do what's best for their health and well-being and the health of their child would be a part of this program.</p><p>I don't necessarily either &mdash; would even characterize them as talking women out of abortion. I think we want to provide real, honest information about what abortion is. And, unfortunately, I think that Planned Parenthood has made abortion the bedrock of their business.</p><p>And because of that, that's just what they do. And that's what they're known for. But it may not be the right thing for every woman who maybe is in an unintended pregnancy situation.</p><p>But the Title X program needs to be very clear in its mission. And its mission is to provide family planning services that do not consider abortion a method of family planning.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>William Brangham:</strong></p> <p>As you say, abortion isn't the right thing for every single woman. But, under these rules, any organization that receives federal money can't talk about abortion at all, can't provide abortion at all, can't really even mention it.</p><p>And do you really think that that is providing for a woman an accurate and appropriate representation of what she should choose for herself?</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Doreen Denny:</strong></p> <p>Well, I don't think, William, you actually accurately suggested that &mdash; well, you maintained that they couldn't even talk about it. And that's just not the case under these rules. So, let me be clear about that.</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>William Brangham:</strong></p> <p>Well, page 19 says: &quot;A Title X project may not perform, promote, refer for or support abortion as a method of family planning, nor take any other affirmative action to assist a patient to secure such an abortion.&quot;</p>  </li> <li>  <p><strong>Doreen Denny:</strong></p> <p>Well, and that's true in terms of referring to a clinic that does abortion. They're not required to do that any longer. That is something they were required to do.</p><p>But it doesn't preclude them from counseling on abortion if a woman would want to know about abortion as an option. That's very important. And it's important to say that, because Planned Parenthood has said there's a gag rule order here. And that's just not true.</p><p>Counseling for abortion can still take place. It's not required.</p>  </li>  <li>  <p><strong>Doreen Denny:</strong></p> <p>If &mdash; if she asks for information about that. And then the clinic could also say, you know, we don't &mdash; we don't have that as a part of what we do. And she can find another location that can.</p><p>I mean, there are many ways of finding out information in this day and age about places and what they do. We all have the Internet, so that's always a possibility.</p>  </li>   </ul>",

Currently, those funds can't be used to provide abortions, but they can go to organizations that offer the procedure.\nCritics contend this rule would essentially zero out groups like Planned Parenthood. The administration and conservative groups counter that they simply want to support centers that put greater emphasis on natural family planning and abstinence counseling.\nWe start with first of two views.\nDoreen Denny is senior director of government relations for Concerned Women of America.\nWelcome to the \"NewsHour.\"\nWilliam Brangham:\nSo, I know your organization was strongly supportive of this rule change. Why do you think it's a good idea?\nDoreen Denny:\nWell, it's important to realize the Title 10 program from inception made was very clear that abortion is not a method of family planning.\nAnd so this rule is just another opportunity to make that statutory reality \u2014 restriction a reality. And I think it's important that people understand that the family planning program, the contraception, the education, the other screenings, the other things that are really important for women and for low-income women, for any woman, will continue to be the \u2014 really the bedrock of what this is all about.\nAnd so we're now going to be in a place where organizations that may have commingled those activities are going to have to make a choice.\nWilliam Brangham:\nI mean, the main organization you're talking about here is Planned Parenthood.\nThey'd argue that this is an attempt to zero them out. And they argue that what happens to all the other services that they provide in communities with lots of low-income women? Are there enough groups that could fill the gap if they suddenly have to go away? Do you worry that that's a possible concern?\nDoreen Denny:\nWell, I don't worry, because, right now, we have federally qualified health centers all over the country that could be a part of this program and do provide services through the Title X program.\nWe have other organizations that have applied. And maybe they haven't been the ones that have been selected, but are just as qualified. Remember, this is a small amount of federal dollars, you know, considering the amount of health services that go out for family planning in communities, whether through the states or other organizations.\nWilliam Brangham:\nDo you think that organizations \u2014 some of the organizations you're describing might be these so-called crisis pregnancy centers, which really try to talk women out of having an abortion.\nDo you think that those organizations should have access to federal money?\nDoreen Denny:\nWell, I think that it's important that all types of providers that want to serve women and do what's best for their health and well-being and the health of their child would be a part of this program.\nI don't necessarily either \u2014 would even characterize them as talking women out of abortion. I think we want to provide real, honest information about what abortion is. And, unfortunately, I think that Planned Parenthood has made abortion the bedrock of their business.\nAnd because of that, that's just what they do. And that's what they're known for. But it may not be the right thing for every woman who maybe is in an unintended pregnancy situation.\nBut the Title X program needs to be very clear in its mission. And its mission is to provide family planning services that do not consider abortion a method of family planning.\nWilliam Brangham:\nAs you say, abortion isn't the right thing for every single woman. But, under these rules, any organization that receives federal money can't talk about abortion at all, can't provide abortion at all, can't really even mention it.\nAnd do you really think that that is providing for a woman an accurate and appropriate representation of what she should choose for herself?\nDoreen Denny:\nWell, I don't think, William, you actually accurately suggested that \u2014 well, you maintained that they couldn't even talk about it. And that's just not the case under these rules. So, let me be clear about that.\nWilliam Brangham:\nWell, page 19 says: \"A Title X project may not perform, promote, refer for or support abortion as a method of family planning, nor take any other affirmative action to assist a patient to secure such an abortion.\"\nDoreen Denny:\nWell, and that's true in terms of referring to a clinic that does abortion. They're not required to do that any longer. That is something they were required to do.\nBut it doesn't preclude them from counseling on abortion if a woman would want to know about abortion as an option. That's very important. And it's important to say that, because Planned Parenthood has said there's a gag rule order here. And that's just not true.\nCounseling for abortion can still take place. It's not required.\nDoreen Denny:\nIf \u2014 if she asks for information about that. And then the clinic could also say, you know, we don't \u2014 we don't have that as a part of what we do. And she can find another location that can.\nI mean, there are many ways of finding out information in this day and age about places and what they do. We all have the Internet, so that's always a possibility.",

Predictions vary widely, from vague, unsubstantial statements about denuclearization to major announcements such as a declaration to officially end the Korean War.</p>\n<p>The summit, which is being held Wednesday and Thursday in Hanoi, Vietnam, marks the second time Trump and Kim will meet face to face.</p>\n<p>The two leaders first <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/tag/singapore-summit\">met last year</a> in Singapore where they <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/read-the-document-signed-by-trump-and-kim-after-the-summit\">signed an agreement</a> to work toward &ldquo;a lasting and stable peace regime,&rdquo; as well as the &ldquo;complete denuclearization&rdquo; of the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>The statement that came out of the Singapore summit <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/trump-and-kim-signed-a-joint-statement-what-does-it-mean\">lacked detail</a>, and there has been much debate since then about whether North Korea has taken <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/north-koreas-kim-promises-denuclearization-but-where-does-diplomacy-stand\">significant steps to denuclearize.</a></p>\n<p>Foreign policy analysts believe the Trump administration is more prepared for this summit than it was last year. U.S. officials have been meeting in advance with their North Korean counterparts in recent months.</p>\n<p>But the Trump administration has also been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/24/mike-pompeo-north-korea-nuclear-threat-trump-tweet-tapper-sotu-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/this-week-in-politics/\">sending mixed messages</a> ahead of this week&rsquo;s summit.</p>\n<p>As a result, even with all of the preparation, analysts say that much of what goes into the agreement guiding U.S.-North Korean relations in the coming months will depend on what happens during the two days in Hanoi.</p>\n<h2>Appearances matter</h2>\n<p>The optics around high-profile international negotiations often draw too much attention, said Balbina Hwang, a former State Department adviser in the George W. Bush administration and visiting professor at Georgetown University. But &ldquo;in this case, [the optics] are really important,&rdquo; Hwang said.</p>\n<p>Which officials attend the meetings and how long the meetings last could offer clues about whether the two countries will reach a deal, and of what magnitude.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"US President Donald Trump (R) and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un (L) sit down for their historic US-North Korea summit, at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island in Singapore on June 12, 2018. - Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un have become on June 12 the first sitting US and North Korean leaders to meet, shake hands and negotiate to end a decades-old nuclear stand-off.

The leaders held a one-on-one without interpreters during the first summit. Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images</p>\n<p>Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney are all scheduled to meet Kim and his advisers Wednesday night local time for a brief greeting and a dinner.</p>\n<p>But on Thursday, Trump and Kim are expected to meet one-on-one with no one else in the room other than interpreters, as they did last year in Singapore.</p>\n<p>The prospect of that solo meeting &ldquo;makes everyone anxious because of what they could say without their advisers there,&rdquo; said Jenny Town, managing editor and producer of 38 North, an online policy journal that focuses on North Korea.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Hwang said, a one-on-one conversation that lasts for hours could mean the two leaders are making progress toward a major deal.</p>\n<h2>Concessions on both sides</h2>\n<p>What a potential agreement would include, and what the U.S. would give up to seal a deal, is another issue.</p>\n<p>Trump administration officials recently told reporters that the U.S. has three overarching goals for the summit: to develop a shared understanding of what complete denuclearization means; create a road map for how to achieve it; and put a freeze on the development of North Korea&rsquo;s weapons of mass destruction and missile programs.</p>\n<p>To get those concessions, the U.S. might have to agree to a treaty to end the Korean War, ease economic sanctions on North Korea or reduce the number of troops on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. has 28,000 troops stationed in South Korea, which are widely seen as a stabilizing force in the region.</p>\n<p>Such concessions might have been unthinkable under previous presidents, but Trump has long been critical of <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/07/donald-trump-doesnt-understand-the-value-of-u-s-bases-overseas/\">U.S. military bases abroad</a> and has a vested interest in coming away with a major agreement after playing up the negotiations for months.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like small ball. He likes big things, so he may walk into this and say, &lsquo;What if I put troops on the table, what will you give me?&rsquo;&rdquo; said Victor Cha, a former director for Asian Affairs at the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration.</p>\n<p>Foreign policy experts have argued that any U.S. concessions should be matched by North Korea committing to take detailed, verifiable steps toward denuclearization.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone thinks there will be a road map for complete denuclearization. But if they could get a work plan for phase 1, concrete measures North Korea would take, and reciprocal measure by the U.S., that would be a good deal,&rdquo; Town said.</p>\n<p>Some experts have speculated <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/closing-north-korean-nuclear-facility-on-the-table-as-trump-kim-summit-nears\">Kim might agree to close Yongbyon</a>, which is believed to be North Korea&rsquo;s main nuclear development and research site. He could also offer to destroy other missile test sites and the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/11/12/667028095/commercial-satellites-reveal-north-korean-missile-base\">tunnel systems</a> used to store missiles.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"This undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency on May 24, 2018 shows what it said is the dismantling of North Korea's nuclear test center.

Photo by KCNA/via Reuters</p>\n<p>Many analysts say those steps would be significant, but they worry Kim will instead agree to other concessions that are largely for show. He could, for example, let inspectors into the Punggye-ri nuclear test site that was demolished last year. Trump praised the move as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/995410516129538048\">a &ldquo;smart and gracious gesture,&rdquo;</a> but many analysts said Punggye-ri was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/22/north-koreas-nuclear-test-site-is-blowing-up-punggye-ri-just-for-show\">largely obsolete</a> before it was dismantled, and had little impact on North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear capabilities.</p>\n<p>The regime could also operate other facilities the U.S. does not know about, or it could simply lie about the steps it is taking toward denuclearization, critics warn.</p>\n<p>Hwang, the former State Department official, said she sees a bigger problem.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are too focused on denuclearization being the litmus test for whether this summit is a success or failure,&rdquo; she said. If North Korea did offer to destroy its nuclear weapons, that would raise &ldquo;gigantic red flags&rdquo; because it means Kim might have other capabilities &mdash; such as biological weapons &mdash; that he believes are more effective than nuclear weapons, Hwang said.</p>\n<h2>How the deal affects other nations</h2>\n<p>Whatever Trump and Kim do is likely to have ramifications for other countries, particularly South Korea and China.</p>\n<p>On Monday, South Korea suggested Trump and Kim could agree to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/world/asia/trump-kim-jong-un-hanoi-summit.html\">formally end the Korean War</a>, which lasted from 1950 and 1953 but was never officially ended with an end-of-war declaration.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;[South Korean] President Moon Jae-in is all out for normalization and possible reunification,&rdquo; said Han Park, a professor emeritus at the University of Georgia who worked as an unofficial negotiator between the U.S. and North Korea. &ldquo;Washington should exploit that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But other experts warn that the U.S. should be clear about what an end-of-war declaration means. The U.S. and South Korea would likely see the declaration as symbolic, but North Korea might demand the U.S. remove troops from the region because it would see them as inconsistent with peace.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"South Korean (blue headbands) and U.S. Marines take positions as amphibious assault vehicles of the South Korean Marine Corps fire smoke bombs during a U.S.-South Korea joint landing operation drill in Pohang, South Korea on March 12, 2016.

Photo by Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters</p>\n<p>Any change in economic sanctions against North Korea could also have significant ramifications for other Asian nations. The easing of sanctions would make North Korea less reliant on China and could open up a new market for future global investments.</p>\n<p>Trump recently told reporters that sanctions against North Korea are &ldquo;on in full&rdquo; ahead of the summit, but that he could unilaterally decide to ease some of the sanctions as part of a deal.</p>\n<p>South Korea and China have also already <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/world/asia/south-korea-sanctions-north-korea.html\">eased some sanctions</a> over the past year.</p>\n<h2>The agreement vs. what Trump and Kim say</h2>\n<p>While a written agreement is important, &ldquo;what matters more than anything else is what the president says,&rdquo; said Laura Rosenberger, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund who worked on the National Security Council during the Obama administration.</p>\n<p>During the Singapore summit last year, for example, many people were caught off guard when Trump said he agreed to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/trump-kim-summit-raises-new-questions-over-south-korean-role\">suspend military exercises</a> with South Korea. There was no mention of the drills in the written deal.</p>\n<p>If Trump promises to do something else not in the written document this year, &ldquo;the North Koreans will believe what he says is a binding agreement,&rdquo; Rosenberger said.</p>\n<p>And if the U.S. does not keep Trump&rsquo;s promise, Kim could use that as a reason not to hold up his side of the bargain either, she said.</p>",

                "text": "What will come out of President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s closely watched meeting this week is far from certain. Predictions vary widely, from vague, unsubstantial statements about denuclearization to major announcements such as a declaration to officially end the Korean War.\nThe summit, which is being held Wednesday and Thursday in Hanoi, Vietnam, marks the second time Trump and Kim will meet face to face.\nThe two leaders first met last year in Singapore where they signed an agreement to work toward \u201ca lasting and stable peace regime,\u201d as well as the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the Korean Peninsula.\nThe statement that came out of the Singapore summit lacked detail, and there has been much debate since then about whether North Korea has taken significant steps to denuclearize.\nForeign policy analysts believe the Trump administration is more prepared for this summit than it was last year. U.S. officials have been meeting in advance with their North Korean counterparts in recent months.\nBut the Trump administration has also been sending mixed messages ahead of this week\u2019s summit.\nAs a result, even with all of the preparation, analysts say that much of what goes into the agreement guiding U.S.-North Korean relations in the coming months will depend on what happens during the two days in Hanoi.\nAppearances matter\nThe optics around high-profile international negotiations often draw too much attention, said Balbina Hwang, a former State Department adviser in the George W. Bush administration and visiting professor at Georgetown University. But \u201cin this case, [the optics] are really important,\u201d Hwang said.\nWhich officials attend the meetings and how long the meetings last could offer clues about whether the two countries will reach a deal, and of what magnitude.\nPresident Donald Trump and North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un sit down for their historic meeting in Singapore on June 12, 2018. The leaders held a one-on-one without interpreters during the first summit. Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\nTrump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney are all scheduled to meet Kim and his advisers Wednesday night local time for a brief greeting and a dinner.\nBut on Thursday, Trump and Kim are expected to meet one-on-one with no one else in the room other than interpreters, as they did last year in Singapore.\nThe prospect of that solo meeting \u201cmakes everyone anxious because of what they could say without their advisers there,\u201d said Jenny Town, managing editor and producer of 38 North, an online policy journal that focuses on North Korea.\nAt the same time, Hwang said, a one-on-one conversation that lasts for hours could mean the two leaders are making progress toward a major deal.\nConcessions on both sides\nWhat a potential agreement would include, and what the U.S. would give up to seal a deal, is another issue.\nTrump administration officials recently told reporters that the U.S. has three overarching goals for the summit: to develop a shared understanding of what complete denuclearization means; create a road map for how to achieve it; and put a freeze on the development of North Korea\u2019s weapons of mass destruction and missile programs.\nTo get those concessions, the U.S. might have to agree to a treaty to end the Korean War, ease economic sanctions on North Korea or reduce the number of troops on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. has 28,000 troops stationed in South Korea, which are widely seen as a stabilizing force in the region.\nSuch concessions might have been unthinkable under previous presidents, but Trump has long been critical of U.S. military bases abroad and has a vested interest in coming away with a major agreement after playing up the negotiations for months.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like small ball. He likes big things, so he may walk into this and say, \u2018What if I put troops on the table, what will you give me?\u2019\u201d said Victor Cha, a former director for Asian Affairs at the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration.\nForeign policy experts have argued that any U.S. concessions should be matched by North Korea committing to take detailed, verifiable steps toward denuclearization.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone thinks there will be a road map for complete denuclearization. But if they could get a work plan for phase 1, concrete measures North Korea would take, and reciprocal measure by the U.S., that would be a good deal,\u201d Town said.\nSome experts have speculated Kim might agree to close Yongbyon, which is believed to be North Korea\u2019s main nuclear development and research site. He could also offer to destroy other missile test sites and the tunnel systems used to store missiles.\nThis undated photo released by North Korea\u2019s Korean Central News Agency on May 24, 2018 shows what it said is the dismantling of North Korea\u2019s nuclear test center. North Korea has not allowed in inspectors to verify the site was completely destroyed. Photo by KCNA/via Reuters\nMany analysts say those steps would be significant, but they worry Kim will instead agree to other concessions that are largely for show. He could, for example, let inspectors into the Punggye-ri nuclear test site that was demolished last year. Trump praised the move as a \u201csmart and gracious gesture,\u201d but many analysts said Punggye-ri was largely obsolete before it was dismantled, and had little impact on North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities.\nThe regime could also operate other facilities the U.S. does not know about, or it could simply lie about the steps it is taking toward denuclearization, critics warn.\nHwang, the former State Department official, said she sees a bigger problem.\n\u201cWe are too focused on denuclearization being the litmus test for whether this summit is a success or failure,\u201d she said. If North Korea did offer to destroy its nuclear weapons, that would raise \u201cgigantic red flags\u201d because it means Kim might have other capabilities \u2014 such as biological weapons \u2014 that he believes are more effective than nuclear weapons, Hwang said.\nHow the deal affects other nations\nWhatever Trump and Kim do is likely to have ramifications for other countries, particularly South Korea and China.\nOn Monday, South Korea suggested Trump and Kim could agree to formally end the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 and 1953 but was never officially ended with an end-of-war declaration.\n\u201c[South Korean] President Moon Jae-in is all out for normalization and possible reunification,\u201d said Han Park, a professor emeritus at the University of Georgia who worked as an unofficial negotiator between the U.S. and North Korea. \u201cWashington should exploit that.\u201d\nBut other experts warn that the U.S. should be clear about what an end-of-war declaration means. The U.S. and South Korea would likely see the declaration as symbolic, but North Korea might demand the U.S. remove troops from the region because it would see them as inconsistent with peace.\nSouth Korean (blue headbands) and U.S. Marines take positions as amphibious assault vehicles of the South Korean Marine Corps fire smoke bombs during a U.S.-South Korea joint landing operation drill in Pohang, South Korea on March 12, 2016.

Photo by Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters\nAny change in economic sanctions against North Korea could also have significant ramifications for other Asian nations. The easing of sanctions would make North Korea less reliant on China and could open up a new market for future global investments.\nTrump recently told reporters that sanctions against North Korea are \u201con in full\u201d ahead of the summit, but that he could unilaterally decide to ease some of the sanctions as part of a deal.\nSouth Korea and China have also already eased some sanctions over the past year.\nThe agreement vs. what Trump and Kim say\nWhile a written agreement is important, \u201cwhat matters more than anything else is what the president says,\u201d said Laura Rosenberger, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund who worked on the National Security Council during the Obama administration.\nDuring the Singapore summit last year, for example, many people were caught off guard when Trump said he agreed to suspend military exercises with South Korea. There was no mention of the drills in the written deal.\nIf Trump promises to do something else not in the written document this year, \u201cthe North Koreans will believe what he says is a binding agreement,\u201d Rosenberger said.\nAnd if the U.S. does not keep Trump\u2019s promise, Kim could use that as a reason not to hold up his side of the bargain either, she said.",
