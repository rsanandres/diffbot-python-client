If it were, it might cut employment taxes, which genuinely do discourage hiring. Rather, it&rsquo;s about huge payouts to the wealthiest Americans &mdash; and deficits be damned! If Republicans embrace this &ldquo;plan&rdquo; after all their hand-wringing about deficits and debt, we should build a Grand Monument to Hypocrisy in their honor.</p></blockquote>\n<p>President Trump&rsquo;s tax plan is specifically designed to eliminate what little tax he already does pay. His released <a href=\"https://occupydemocrats.com/2017/04/26/trump-just-announced-plans-eliminate-tax-still-pays/\">2005 tax return shows that the paid $31 million through the AMT tax, which is one of the taxes that just so happened</a> to be specifically targeted for elimination.</p>\n<p>Kristof goes on to call out Trump for trying to spin the same old widely-debunked voodoo economic claptrap that Republicans have been pushing for three decades now and betraying his promise to defend and uplift the American middle class.</p>\n<blockquote> <p data-para-count=\"143\" data-total-count=\"444\">Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says Trump&rsquo;s tax &ldquo;plan&rdquo; would be paid for partly &ldquo;with growth&rdquo; &mdash; which means that he has no idea how to pay for it.</p> <p data-para-count=\"143\" data-total-count=\"444\">Effectively, we&rsquo;d borrow from China or other countries to finance huge tax breaks for Trump and his minions. And this is populism?</p> </blockquote>\n<p>This is the very opposite of &ldquo;populism.&rdquo; Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;tax plan&rdquo; is nothing less than an act of class warfare by the ultrawealthy elites.</p>\n<p>Trump and his band of pillaging plutocrats would deprive our nation of its future by exploding the deficit by seven trillion dollars in the first decade, money that will sit in the bank vaults of the oligarchs collecting dust instead of being spent to repair our nation&rsquo;s failing infrastructure, care for the most vulnerable in our population, and cultivate a vibrant and diverse civil society.</p>\n<p>When asked <a href=\"https://occupydemocrats.com/2017/04/26/trumps-treasury-chief-just-asked-plan-will-help-middle-class-answer-awful/\">how this will help the middle class</a>, Secretary Mnuchin had no answers.</p>\n<p>And once again, the American middle class will have to pay for it, just like we had to pay to bail out the oligarch class when they crashed the stock market and caused the Great Recession.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s shamelessly avaricious intent grimly illustrates the arrogance with which the wealthy elites wield their power in the United States, knowing they are insulated from consequence by their millions and content to plunge the rest of us into poverty.</p>\n<p>The people of America must mobilize and send a shockwave during the 2018 midterms warning Trump and his cronies this kind of naked plutocracy will not be tolerated in a free republic.</p>\n<h3>What do you think?</h3>",

                "text": "Yesterday, President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin made a huge show out of releasing their plans for the \u201cbiggest tax cut in history,\u201d promising \u201cmassive\u201d help for the middle class.\nBut the one-page document they presented to the American made it clear that all that talk was just a smokescreen to hide Trump\u2019s true intentions \u2013 to make sure he and his billionaire buddies never have to pay taxes again.\nNew York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof skewered Trump\u2019s tax plan in a brutal op-ed published today which sums the situation up perfectly: \u201cThis Isn\u2019t Tax Policy; It\u2019s a Trump-Led Heist.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s new tax \u201cplan\u201d (more like an extremely vague plan for a plan) is an irresponsible, shameless, budget-busting gift to zillionaires like himself.\nThis isn\u2019t about \u201cjobs,\u201d as the White House claims. If it were, it might cut employment taxes, which genuinely do discourage hiring. Rather, it\u2019s about huge payouts to the wealthiest Americans \u2014 and deficits be damned! If Republicans embrace this \u201cplan\u201d after all their hand-wringing about deficits and debt, we should build a Grand Monument to Hypocrisy in their honor.\nPresident Trump\u2019s tax plan is specifically designed to eliminate what little tax he already does pay. His released 2005 tax return shows that the paid $31 million through the AMT tax, which is one of the taxes that just so happened to be specifically targeted for elimination.\nKristof goes on to call out Trump for trying to spin the same old widely-debunked voodoo economic claptrap that Republicans have been pushing for three decades now and betraying his promise to defend and uplift the American middle class.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says Trump\u2019s tax \u201cplan\u201d would be paid for partly \u201cwith growth\u201d \u2014 which means that he has no idea how to pay for it.\nEffectively, we\u2019d borrow from China or other countries to finance huge tax breaks for Trump and his minions. And this is populism?\nThis is the very opposite of \u201cpopulism.\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201ctax plan\u201d is nothing less than an act of class warfare by the ultrawealthy elites.\nTrump and his band of pillaging plutocrats would deprive our nation of its future by exploding the deficit by seven trillion dollars in the first decade, money that will sit in the bank vaults of the oligarchs collecting dust instead of being spent to repair our nation\u2019s failing infrastructure, care for the most vulnerable in our population, and cultivate a vibrant and diverse civil society.\nWhen asked how this will help the middle class, Secretary Mnuchin had no answers.\nAnd once again, the American middle class will have to pay for it, just like we had to pay to bail out the oligarch class when they crashed the stock market and caused the Great Recession.\nTrump\u2019s shamelessly avaricious intent grimly illustrates the arrogance with which the wealthy elites wield their power in the United States, knowing they are insulated from consequence by their millions and content to plunge the rest of us into poverty.\nThe people of America must mobilize and send a shockwave during the 2018 midterms warning Trump and his cronies this kind of naked plutocracy will not be tolerated in a free republic.\nWhat do you think?",

During the campaign, Trump ridiculed McCain\u2019s time as a prisoner of war, saying \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d\nCertainly, we can and should have political disagreements with McCain, but respect for his service should be a given. It takes a special kind of hypocrisy to simultaneously denigrate black athletes for kneeling during the National Anthem and ridicule the disabilities that a war hero incurred in his service to our country.\nOnce again, Trump\u2019s actions are truly shameful. Today, Meghan McCain speaks for all of us.\nWhat more must my family be put through right now? This is abhorrent. https://t.co/xJmFdh93xL\nWhat do you think?",

Former co-president of Fox News Bill Shine was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/27/former-fox-news-co-pres-bill-shine-is-in-final-talks-with-trump-about-.html\">ousted from the conservative network in May 2017</a> after becoming embroiled in the high-profile sexual harassment scandal that had enveloped the outlet.</p>\n<p>Shine oversaw the departure of former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who was forced to resign after a 20-year career after former anchor Gretchen Carlson <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roger-ailes-resigns-as-fox-913206\">filed suit</a> against him &ndash; and ultimately joined by others &ndash; who alleged sexual misconduct. He died shortly thereafter. Shine, for his part, remained a staunch defender of the serial abuser.</p>\n<p>The move is yet another shameful indication of Fox News&rsquo; entrenchment in this administration. A network that once billed itself as &ldquo;fair and balanced&rdquo; &ndash; a title that it finally shed in a rare glimpse of self-acknowledgment &ndash; is not only serving as a mouthpiece for the administration, but staffing it. It&rsquo;s American state propaganda.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the move is not surprising either. Trump adding another unqualified shill whose shameful failure to protect women amid the #MeToo movement is par for the course in a White House that operates more like a C-grade reality show than the respected institution that it once was.</p>\n<h3>What do you think?</h3>",

                "text": "While the role of White House communications director has remained vacant since the departure of Hope Hicks in March, new reports have revealed that the president has offered the job to a well-known former Fox News executive \u2013 who has accepted the position.\nOf course, this isn\u2019t just any Fox News executive. Former co-president of Fox News Bill Shine was ousted from the conservative network in May 2017 after becoming embroiled in the high-profile sexual harassment scandal that had enveloped the outlet.\nShine oversaw the departure of former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who was forced to resign after a 20-year career after former anchor Gretchen Carlson filed suit against him \u2013 and ultimately joined by others \u2013 who alleged sexual misconduct. He died shortly thereafter. Shine, for his part, remained a staunch defender of the serial abuser.\nThe move is yet another shameful indication of Fox News\u2019 entrenchment in this administration. A network that once billed itself as \u201cfair and balanced\u201d \u2013 a title that it finally shed in a rare glimpse of self-acknowledgment \u2013 is not only serving as a mouthpiece for the administration, but staffing it. It\u2019s American state propaganda.\nSadly, the move is not surprising either. Trump adding another unqualified shill whose shameful failure to protect women amid the #MeToo movement is par for the course in a White House that operates more like a C-grade reality show than the respected institution that it once was.\nWhat do you think?",

Maxine Waters is far from the sharpest pencil in the box , which makes the fact that she serves as chair of the vitally important House Financial Services Committee nearly incomprehensible.\nBarely pausing for breath after hilariously mangling the names of famous social media companies (\u201cFacepage\u201d? \u201cTweeter\u201d?), Maxine Waters went from strength to strength, and began ranting about how she still intends to seek the impeachment of President Trump over the now-debunked Russian collusion narrative.\nCheck it out here. The gaffes begin at about the 6:20 mark.\nWesternJournal reports: The recently released final report from special counsel Robert Mueller made it abundantly clear that, despite countless media reports and claims to the contrary from elected Democrats, there was no evidence suggesting any sort of conspiracy or coordination \u2014 collusion, if you will \u2014 between then-candidate Trump or any of his associates with the Russian government in the 2016 election.\nWaters appears to have not received that memo, or simply to have ignored the clear message contained therein, as she continued to insist that Trump and his allies were guilty \u2014 with overwhelming evidence proving such on her social media accounts \u2014 of colluding with the Kremlin in Moscow.\nIn arguing as much, however, Waters claimed the evidence of Trump\u2019s membership in the \u201cKremlin Klan\u201d was there for everyone to see on her \u201cFacepage\u201d and \u201cTweeter\u201d accounts, a hilariously wrong mispronunciation of \u201cFacebook\u201d and \u201cTwitter.\u201d\nLast year President described Maxine Waters as \u201can extraordinarily low IQ person\u201d, before warning to \u201cbe careful what you wish for\u201d after the California Democrat called on activists to confront White House officials over their immigration policies wherever possible.\n\u201cCongresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cShe has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!\u201d",

Garcia was one of four former Peruvian presidents that was sucked into the scandal.\nWhat was the evidence against Garcia?

                "html": "<h2>Why you should care</h2>\n<p>How well products and campaigns do in China could soon determine whether the world&rsquo;s top luxury brands bring them to stores around the world.</p>\n<p>Gildo Zegna, CEO of luxury Italian brand Ermenegildo Zegna, recently declared that his firm was moving its test market to China. While Chinese consumers were already a key demographic for the famed menswear brand, early responses from Chinese customers will now dictate what new product lines Zegna launches around the world.</p>\n<p>This shift east, which is shaking up the global fashion industry, is driven by a combination of factors: the <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/opinion/does-the-century-have-to-belong-to-china/91299\">evolution of China&rsquo;s own market</a>, manufacturing strategies, technologies and spending power. With Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Burberry shopping bags in tow, top fashion brands are now turning to China as a litmus test for their global plans.</p>\n<p>The country&rsquo;s emergence as a major consumer market for luxury fashion brands makes it a strong choice. But China also offers a younger population than the West &mdash; and has more disposable income than in other young developing nations &mdash; and is armed with tech innovations that in some cases are ahead of the developed world. That makes the country ideal for these brands to test how to sell themselves to a younger, tech-obsessed and highly demanding audience globally.</p>\n<p>Gucci and Calvin Klein have both launched tailored ad campaigns on Chinese platforms over the past six months, before later adapting them for an international audience. In 2018, Nicolas Versloot, the regional managing director for Levi Strauss, made it clear China would be at the forefront of the denim brand&rsquo;s innovation going forward.</p>\n<blockquote> <p>WeChat&rsquo;s built-in functions allow an integrated one-stop purchasing experience, and this is very helpful to luxury brands.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>The seamless integration of e-commerce functionalities into social media platforms, exemplified by China&rsquo;s giant multipurpose app WeChat, doesn&rsquo;t yet exist outside China, but is the direction in which global social media and e-commerce sites are moving, experts say. So using China as a test market means these fashion brands are ready for the shift. In June 2018, luxury Italian accessories label Tod&rsquo;s tested the sale of a restricted number of limited edition bags through a mini-program within the WeChat app. It sold bags worth 3.2 million yuan ($480,000) in six minutes. Burberry is now focusing its marketing strategy around optimizing integrated platforms like WeChat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With shortened attention spans, Chinese consumers would want to speed up their luxury purchasing journey,&rdquo; says Rachel Lou, social media analyst at marketing firm Dragon Social. &ldquo;WeChat&rsquo;s built-in functions allow an integrated one-stop purchasing experience, and this is very helpful to luxury brands as the growth in physical stores is stagnating.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Fashion has often served as an early pointer to broader social and economic shifts. From Gandhi in India to a series of African leaders, anti-colonial icons used local textiles to propel a larger revival of their countries&rsquo; domestic manufacturing sector. The fashion industry was an early adopter of the rental model &mdash; companies like Rent the Runway in New York and a slew of Swedish firms in Stockholm led the charge &mdash; that has now expanded even to toy sharing. It embraced technologies such as 3D printing, virtual reality and augmented reality &mdash; in part for marketing campaigns to target millennials &mdash; before most other retail sectors. This reputation as an industry that&rsquo;s both a weather vane and ahead of the curve suggests that luxury fashion brands might be only the first to shift test markets to China and that others might follow.</p>\n<p>After all, many of the advantages China offers to luxury brands would also help other international industries. One such benefit to testing marketing and sales strategies and technologies in China is the mountain of user data available, particularly through WeChat, used by more than 1 billion people daily. That means both huge potential exposure and feedback for brands, says Thomas Klein, chief operating officer of Beijing-based digital branding firm Creative Union. Brands can learn about the effectiveness of strategies and campaigns from an enormous audience almost in real time.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why digital marketing is increasingly where global fashion firms are investing in China. According to consulting firm Zenith Media, foreign luxury brands are expected to focus 68 percent of their advertising budgets in China on e-commerce channels in 2019, up from 53 percent in 2017. Most brands spend between 30 and 60 percent of that expenditure on WeChat.</p>\n<p>The maturing of Chinese consumers is also making them more typical of the international market &mdash; while still carrying the aspirational traits that make them representative of developing markets. &ldquo;Chinese luxury consumers are not only cashed up, but they are also <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/made-in-china-fashion-goes-green/83285\">savvy and adventurous</a>,&rdquo; says William Chen, managing director at Luxion Media, a social media consulting agency. &ldquo;They are always on the hunt for new brands with a story, with something unique that sets it apart.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Of course, it isn&rsquo;t as easy as simply transplanting successful strategies from China to other markets. The country&rsquo;s unique digital environment and consumer market provide great opportunities for brands to stay ahead of the curve by testing there. But until some of those tech-based sales tools also become common in the West, strategies shaped in China will still need tweaks to suit advertising and sales platforms in North America and Europe.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s worth the wait for luxury brands that see the integration of advertising, personalization and e-commerce as the future, and so view China as the best test market for shaping their digital strategies. There are benefits in the immediate too &mdash; with <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/wechat-chinas-weapon-of-mass-propaganda/88709\">WeChat spreading rapidly across other Asian countries</a>, some of the strategies tested in China could find quicker application in other emerging economies.</p>\n<p>China&rsquo;s own appetite for luxury fashion remains insatiable &mdash; never mind a slowing economy and the trade conflict with the U.S. &mdash; so any market research in the country is useful for these brands. So much so that China&rsquo;s fashion market is expected to eclipse America&rsquo;s for the first time this year, according to global consulting group McKinsey. What works and fails there is what might well determine the fashion lines you see at high-end stores next season in Milan and Madrid.</p>",

                "text": "Why you should care\nHow well products and campaigns do in China could soon determine whether the world\u2019s top luxury brands bring them to stores around the world.\nGildo Zegna, CEO of luxury Italian brand Ermenegildo Zegna, recently declared that his firm was moving its test market to China. While Chinese consumers were already a key demographic for the famed menswear brand, early responses from Chinese customers will now dictate what new product lines Zegna launches around the world.\nThis shift east, which is shaking up the global fashion industry, is driven by a combination of factors: the evolution of China\u2019s own market, manufacturing strategies, technologies and spending power. With Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Burberry shopping bags in tow, top fashion brands are now turning to China as a litmus test for their global plans.\nThe country\u2019s emergence as a major consumer market for luxury fashion brands makes it a strong choice. But China also offers a younger population than the West \u2014 and has more disposable income than in other young developing nations \u2014 and is armed with tech innovations that in some cases are ahead of the developed world. That makes the country ideal for these brands to test how to sell themselves to a younger, tech-obsessed and highly demanding audience globally.\nGucci and Calvin Klein have both launched tailored ad campaigns on Chinese platforms over the past six months, before later adapting them for an international audience. In 2018, Nicolas Versloot, the regional managing director for Levi Strauss, made it clear China would be at the forefront of the denim brand\u2019s innovation going forward.\nWeChat\u2019s built-in functions allow an integrated one-stop purchasing experience, and this is very helpful to luxury brands.\nThe seamless integration of e-commerce functionalities into social media platforms, exemplified by China\u2019s giant multipurpose app WeChat, doesn\u2019t yet exist outside China, but is the direction in which global social media and e-commerce sites are moving, experts say. So using China as a test market means these fashion brands are ready for the shift. In June 2018, luxury Italian accessories label Tod\u2019s tested the sale of a restricted number of limited edition bags through a mini-program within the WeChat app. It sold bags worth 3.2 million yuan ($480,000) in six minutes. Burberry is now focusing its marketing strategy around optimizing integrated platforms like WeChat.\n\u201cWith shortened attention spans, Chinese consumers would want to speed up their luxury purchasing journey,\u201d says Rachel Lou, social media analyst at marketing firm Dragon Social. \u201cWeChat\u2019s built-in functions allow an integrated one-stop purchasing experience, and this is very helpful to luxury brands as the growth in physical stores is stagnating.\u201d\nFashion has often served as an early pointer to broader social and economic shifts. From Gandhi in India to a series of African leaders, anti-colonial icons used local textiles to propel a larger revival of their countries\u2019 domestic manufacturing sector. The fashion industry was an early adopter of the rental model \u2014 companies like Rent the Runway in New York and a slew of Swedish firms in Stockholm led the charge \u2014 that has now expanded even to toy sharing. It embraced technologies such as 3D printing, virtual reality and augmented reality \u2014 in part for marketing campaigns to target millennials \u2014 before most other retail sectors. This reputation as an industry that\u2019s both a weather vane and ahead of the curve suggests that luxury fashion brands might be only the first to shift test markets to China and that others might follow.\nAfter all, many of the advantages China offers to luxury brands would also help other international industries. One such benefit to testing marketing and sales strategies and technologies in China is the mountain of user data available, particularly through WeChat, used by more than 1 billion people daily. That means both huge potential exposure and feedback for brands, says Thomas Klein, chief operating officer of Beijing-based digital branding firm Creative Union. Brands can learn about the effectiveness of strategies and campaigns from an enormous audience almost in real time.\nThat\u2019s why digital marketing is increasingly where global fashion firms are investing in China. According to consulting firm Zenith Media, foreign luxury brands are expected to focus 68 percent of their advertising budgets in China on e-commerce channels in 2019, up from 53 percent in 2017. Most brands spend between 30 and 60 percent of that expenditure on WeChat.\nThe maturing of Chinese consumers is also making them more typical of the international market \u2014 while still carrying the aspirational traits that make them representative of developing markets. \u201cChinese luxury consumers are not only cashed up, but they are also savvy and adventurous,\u201d says William Chen, managing director at Luxion Media, a social media consulting agency. \u201cThey are always on the hunt for new brands with a story, with something unique that sets it apart.\u201d\nOf course, it isn\u2019t as easy as simply transplanting successful strategies from China to other markets. The country\u2019s unique digital environment and consumer market provide great opportunities for brands to stay ahead of the curve by testing there. But until some of those tech-based sales tools also become common in the West, strategies shaped in China will still need tweaks to suit advertising and sales platforms in North America and Europe.\nThat\u2019s worth the wait for luxury brands that see the integration of advertising, personalization and e-commerce as the future, and so view China as the best test market for shaping their digital strategies. There are benefits in the immediate too \u2014 with WeChat spreading rapidly across other Asian countries, some of the strategies tested in China could find quicker application in other emerging economies.\nChina\u2019s own appetite for luxury fashion remains insatiable \u2014 never mind a slowing economy and the trade conflict with the U.S. \u2014 so any market research in the country is useful for these brands. So much so that China\u2019s fashion market is expected to eclipse America\u2019s for the first time this year, according to global consulting group McKinsey. What works and fails there is what might well determine the fashion lines you see at high-end stores next season in Milan and Madrid.",

It&rsquo;s been a hectic first 100 days of Donald <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/a-white-house-defender-in-the-trenches-of-the-swamp/75928\">Trump&rsquo;s</a> presidency. We have a new Supreme Court justice, Obamacare is still standing (for now), the U.S. military struck Syria with Tomahawk cruise missiles, and <em>Saturday Night Live</em> has material for ages thanks to the tweeter in chief &mdash; and press secretary Sean Spicer. We&rsquo;ll leave further recaps to others and take a look at Trump&rsquo;s next 100 days, with the standard caveat that this president lives to be unpredictable.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Kim Jong-Un\" data-image-large=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages529940582.jpg?w=940\" data-image-large-size=\"940xany\" data-image-tablet=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages529940582.jpg?w=768\" data-image-tablet-size=\"768xany\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages529940582.jpg?w=660&is-pending-load=1\" src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages529940582.jpg?w=940\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img><figcaption>North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has sparked plenty of debates over his intentions.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The biggest misconception about Kim Jong-un is that he&rsquo;s insane. Waving around a nuclear arsenal like a child brandishing a new toy, allegedly ordering the assassination of a half brother with a nerve agent in another country&rsquo;s airport, warehousing 100,000 political prisoners in forced-labor camps &mdash; these are not the actions of a well-adjusted world leader. But North Korea&rsquo;s accelerating nuclear ambitions and provocations toward South Korea and the United States are perfectly rational as the authoritarian regime seeks to satisfy its elites, rally the masses and hold onto power. They&rsquo;re also the most explosive test of Trump&rsquo;s foreign policy over the next 100 days.</p>\n<p>But short of preemptively bombing missile sites &mdash; Trump has indicated he&rsquo;s willing to do it, with the Syria strike and &ldquo;mother of all bombs&rdquo; drop in Afghanistan under his belt &mdash; there&rsquo;s little direct impact the U.S. can have. China, then, is the key.</p>\n<p>China has long helped prop up the rogue nation for fear of the instability a collapse would bring, but there are signs that Beijing is growing tired of Kim&rsquo;s antics. China announced this year it was cutting off coal imports from its neighbor. The next step could be to halt crude oil exports to North Korea.</p>\n<p>If China won&rsquo;t move, Trump could impose second-order sanctions on Chinese companies that deal with <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/wanted-heroic-diplomacy-to-tame-north-korea/76944\">North Korea</a>&mdash; locking banks out of the critical U.S. financial system, for example. Previous administrations have avoided such a step for fear of angering Beijing. For its part, North Korea shows no signs of changing course as it tests missiles and threatens nuclear war. &ldquo;When you normalize provocations, and then people will think, &lsquo;Oh, yeah, the North Koreans, they are just doing what they do,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s great for North Korea,&rdquo; says Kent Boydston, a Korea expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Beware the crazy-uncle excuse.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Border wall Mexico\" data-image-large=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/v-s-k-gettyimages72124379.jpg?w=940\" data-image-large-size=\"940xany\" data-image-tablet=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/v-s-k-gettyimages72124379.jpg?w=768\" data-image-tablet-size=\"768xany\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/v-s-k-gettyimages72124379.jpg?w=660&is-pending-load=1\" src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/v-s-k-gettyimages72124379.jpg?w=940\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img><figcaption>Dusk falls over a section of the US-Mexico border fence</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It was one of his first and most prominent pledges: a big, beautiful wall on America&rsquo;s southern border, which would be paid for by Mexico because of the Donald&rsquo;s negotiating acumen.</p>\n<p>Within days of taking office, Trump signed an executive order to start &ldquo;immediate construction of a physical wall&rdquo; along with other border security measures. But he needs Congress to follow through with the money, as Mexico&rsquo;s president has made it clear he&rsquo;s disinclined to write a check for the wall. Trump has responded with vague pledges about how Mexico might pay indirectly.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"> <p>Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>So how much will the great wall cost? The Trump administration requested $4.1 billion over two years, but that&rsquo;s a fraction of what a physical barrier across the entire border would cost. <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/the-coming-battle-over-the-filibusters-blue-hued-cousin/76610\">Senate</a> Democrats extrapolated from prototype proposals that a 1,827-mile wall would cost at least $64 billion &mdash; and $150 million more per year to maintain. An internal Department of Homeland Security analysis, Reuters reports, pegged the cost at $21.4 billion to shore up the 1,250 miles of the border that are not already fortified.</p>\n<p>Democrats are digging in, vowing to block any spending bill that includes wall money &mdash; and for more than fiscal reasons. &ldquo;It stems from a value: Are you somebody who sees the humanity in our neighbors, or are you not?&rdquo; asks Faiz Shakir, national political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is pushing Democrats to stand firm. The result was Trump backing off his demand to include wall funding in a government spending bill, postponing the fight.</p>\n<p>This is in part because even border-state Republicans who are hawkish on immigration say electronic surveillance in some places might be preferable to a barrier. And the government would have to seize some property under eminent domain to build a wall, a tactic not likely to sit well with landowners. The <em>Houston Chronicle</em> recently quoted House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, telling local college students: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think a 30-foot concrete wall is going to be the answer.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4>The easygoing investigator who could derail the presidency</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC)\" data-image-large=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages169187196.jpg?w=940\" data-image-large-size=\"940xany\" data-image-tablet=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages169187196.jpg?w=768\" data-image-tablet-size=\"768xany\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages169187196.jpg?w=660&is-pending-load=1\" src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages169187196.jpg?w=940\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>The topic was serious, the tone sober when Republican Sen. Richard Burr shared a news conference podium with Democrat Mark Warner to talk about Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their investigation of it. But Burr wore a slight smirk when setting a ground rule in his light North <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/the-queer-pastor-riling-up-conservative-north-carolina/74916\">Carolina</a> drawl: &ldquo;We will not take questions on the House Intelligence Committee.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As the Russia investigation unfolds, it&rsquo;s the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence who will be charged with maintaining the professionalism and bipartisanship critical to making the probe credible. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who soaked up the attention during the first 100 days, showed himself too chummy with Trump to assess impartially whether the president&rsquo;s campaign collaborated with foreign interests, and he stepped aside from leading the probe. Thus, Burr has taken center stage in the casual manner he handles most everything else.</p>\n<p>Burr is known around the Capitol for his quirks &mdash; wearing loafers without socks, driving a 1974 open-air Volkswagen Thing &mdash; and for being tight with former house speaker John Boehner. Burr took over the chairmanship of the intelligence committee early in 2015. It&rsquo;s a job that makes one privy to the nation&rsquo;s darkest secrets and biggest fears, and it requires lots of time locked away with classified materials, unreachable to the outside world. Burr&rsquo;s longtime political consultant Paul Shumaker tells OZY that Burr told him early on: &ldquo;There would be times in his re-election that we would have to run a campaign without a candidate, because he was going to put that responsibility of the committee chairmanship first.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><iframe data-instgrm-payload-id=\"instagram-media-payload-0\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/XIO-27h9lh/embed/captioned/?cr=1&v=12&wp=500&rd=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ozy.com&rp=%2Fpolitics-and-power%2Fchapter-two-of-trumps-presidency-the-next-100-days%2F77048%2F#%7B%22ci%22%3A0%2C%22os%22%3A1071.824999526143%2C%22ls%22%3A946.0399998351932%2C%22le%22%3A949.5500000193715%7D\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Burr&rsquo;s lack of interest in campaigning was often interpreted in D.C. circles as laziness, but he won an unexpectedly tight race last year and says his third term in the Senate will be his last. Though he typically votes the party line, Burr is now free of political shackles as he pursues the ties between Moscow and Trump Tower. Last year Burr was more steadfast than many GOP senators in supporting Trump, and Yahoo! News recently reported growing frustration among the committee&rsquo;s Democrats that Burr is slow-walking the probe. If it appears to be tainted by politics, pressure will grow for a special prosecutor to come in. Ask Ken Starr and Bill Clinton how that works out.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"china shipping containers\" data-image-large=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/v-s-k-shutterstock_189076856.jpg?w=940\" data-image-large-size=\"940xany\" data-image-tablet=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/v-s-k-shutterstock_189076856.jpg?w=768\" data-image-tablet-size=\"768xany\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/v-s-k-shutterstock_189076856.jpg?w=660&is-pending-load=1\" src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/v-s-k-shutterstock_189076856.jpg?w=940\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img><figcaption>China Shipping Lines Cargo Ship Summer loading at the Port of Oakland</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In late April, Trump sat at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office surrounded by steel industry honchos to sign an executive order to &ldquo;prioritize&rdquo; an investigation into the effects of low-cost steel imports, implicitly targeting China, a familiar trade foe. Then Trump&rsquo;s focus shifted to what appeared to be handwritten notes and an unusual target inspired by a visit to Wisconsin two days earlier: &ldquo;In Canada, what they&rsquo;ve done to our dairy farm workers is a disgrace.&rdquo; The &ldquo;NAFTA disaster,&rdquo; as Trump termed it, has to do with our northern neighbor&rsquo;s market protections for its dairy farmers. Then last week, he slapped a tariff on Canadian soft lumber imports. Along with cheap Mexican manufacturing, it&rsquo;s part of his argument to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been in force since 1994.</p>\n<p>Trade policy was one of the most consistent <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/2016/is-trump-right-on-trade/71323\">planks</a> of Trump&rsquo;s campaign. He immediately pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership upon taking office, but that treaty was never ratified. Trump last week said he was backing off plans to pull out of NAFTA altogether, and would start fresh negotiations with Ottawa and Mexico City. Opening up a long-standing deal will take more time and finesse, though commerce secretary Wilbur Ross recently said a revamped NAFTA might look a lot like what Mexico and Canada agreed to in the TPP &mdash; such as tougher labor and environmental standards. Though most of Trump&rsquo;s moves so far have been rhetorical, with pledged reviews and investigations, the Canadian lumber action is the first sign of teeth, with more to come over the next 100 days.</p>\n<p>But in the wake of the summit with President Xi Jinping, Trump notably backed down from a campaign pledge to label China a currency manipulator, a move that would lead to tariffs and other punishments. The policy whiplash is often seen as the reflection of the internal struggle between senior counselor Steve Bannon&rsquo;s economic nationalism and a more moderate approach from chief economic adviser Gary Cohn&rsquo;s crowd, a debate not likely to go away anytime soon.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Anthony Kennedy Neil Gorsuch Trump\" data-image-large=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages666865066.jpg?w=940\" data-image-large-size=\"940xany\" data-image-tablet=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages666865066.jpg?w=768\" data-image-tablet-size=\"768xany\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages666865066.jpg?w=660&is-pending-load=1\" src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages666865066.jpg?w=940\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>Washington&rsquo;s most scrutinized &mdash; and at times inscrutable &mdash; octogenarian has a choice to make in June. Anthony Kennedy will decide whether to hang up his robe as the Supreme Court&rsquo;s swing justice. Though high court retirements are as tough to predict as their decisions, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the head of the Judiciary Committee that would consider a replacement, recently told constituents in Iowa that he expects a SCOTUS vacancy this summer.</p>\n<p>On an evenly split court, Kennedy has tilted conservative on some issues (gun rights, campaign finance) and liberal on others (gay rights, affirmative action). Most critically for the fight to come over his seat, Kennedy has repeatedly upheld a woman&rsquo;s right to an abortion. Add an antiabortion justice, and the legally questionable 1973 ruling Roe v. Wade easily could tumble.</p>\n<p>The filibuster already has fallen for Supreme Court nominees in this year&rsquo;s partisan battle over Neil Gorsuch, so the next justice will face a 50-vote threshold in the Senate. Still, the higher ideological stakes than the Gorsuch&ndash;for&ndash;Antonin Scalia swap means &ldquo;the <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/opinion/why-trumps-real-supreme-court-fight-is-the-next-one/75415\">battle</a> for Kennedy&rsquo;s seat will be Armageddon and will likely take a long while in the Senate,&rdquo; says Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.</p>\n<p>If Armageddon arrives, keep an eye on whether Trump sticks to the list of conservative Federalist Society&ndash;approved judges he put out during the campaign, and the signals from GOP moderates Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. And remember Kennedy himself was Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s third choice, after the defeat of the severely conservative Robert Bork and the withdrawal of Douglas Ginsburg who &mdash; gasp! &mdash; admitted to smoking marijuana a few times.</p>\n<h4>If you take a walk, I&rsquo;ll tax your feet</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"President Donald Trump signs an Executive Order,\" data-image-large=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages671379270.jpg?w=940\" data-image-large-size=\"940xany\" data-image-tablet=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages671379270.jpg?w=768\" data-image-tablet-size=\"768xany\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages671379270.jpg?w=660&is-pending-load=1\" src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gettyimages671379270.jpg?w=940\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img><figcaption>President Donald Trump signs an executive order identifying and reducing tax regulatory burdens.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For decades, blowing up the tax code has been the Washington equivalent of Tantalus&rsquo; apple from Greek mythology: always just out of reach. Everyone &mdash; except, perhaps, the nation&rsquo;s accountants &mdash; agrees that the code is too complex, but every deduction has a lobby attached. Just before the end of his first 100 days in office, Trump announced an outline to slash tax rates for individuals and corporations. Now comes the hard part: steering it through Congress.</p>\n<p>Republicans propose that most families will be able to fill out their taxes on a postcard, with a juiced-up standard deduction or itemized deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving but nothing else. Democrats have sent mixed signals about whether they&rsquo;d be open to working with Republicans on the plan. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he wants Trump to release his own taxes first &mdash; an exceedingly unlikely proposition and a nod to Democrats&rsquo; protest-minded base.</p>\n<p>Republicans remain divided over the &ldquo;border adjustment tax&rdquo; on imports, designed to help American manufacturers and offset the deficit impact of the rate cuts. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no pleasant way to raise $2 trillion,&rdquo; says Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and an OZY contributor. Norquist adds that his reply to any business complaining about a border tax when the corporate rate has been cut from 35 percent to 15 percent would be: &ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; The border adjustment tax was not in last week&rsquo;s White House outline, which on its own is likely to increase the deficit, meaning congressional rules would force the tax cuts to expire after 10 years rather than become permanent. As the debate unfolds, look out for competing analyses from the White House predicting huge growth and lower deficits and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</p>\n<p>Another barometer to watch: the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It has jumped more than 10 percent since Election Day, in part on the promise of a regulation- and tax-slashing presidency. Trump has started to deliver on the former. The latter will be a slog.</p>\n<p>Those are the issues we can see coming. Because it&rsquo;s Donald Trump, there&rsquo;s always the chance for a wild-card moment, particularly as the country gorges on the latest dramatics in <em>As the West Wing Turns</em>. Perhaps Bannon will end up ambassador to Liechtenstein by the time we hit Day 200.</p>",

                "text": "Take a breath. It\u2019s been a hectic first 100 days of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. We have a new Supreme Court justice, Obamacare is still standing (for now), the U.S. military struck Syria with Tomahawk cruise missiles, and Saturday Night Live has material for ages thanks to the tweeter in chief \u2014 and press secretary Sean Spicer. We\u2019ll leave further recaps to others and take a look at Trump\u2019s next 100 days, with the standard caveat that this president lives to be unpredictable.\nThe biggest misconception about Kim Jong-un is that he\u2019s insane. Waving around a nuclear arsenal like a child brandishing a new toy, allegedly ordering the assassination of a half brother with a nerve agent in another country\u2019s airport, warehousing 100,000 political prisoners in forced-labor camps \u2014 these are not the actions of a well-adjusted world leader. But North Korea\u2019s accelerating nuclear ambitions and provocations toward South Korea and the United States are perfectly rational as the authoritarian regime seeks to satisfy its elites, rally the masses and hold onto power. They\u2019re also the most explosive test of Trump\u2019s foreign policy over the next 100 days.\nBut short of preemptively bombing missile sites \u2014 Trump has indicated he\u2019s willing to do it, with the Syria strike and \u201cmother of all bombs\u201d drop in Afghanistan under his belt \u2014 there\u2019s little direct impact the U.S. can have. China, then, is the key.\nChina has long helped prop up the rogue nation for fear of the instability a collapse would bring, but there are signs that Beijing is growing tired of Kim\u2019s antics. China announced this year it was cutting off coal imports from its neighbor. The next step could be to halt crude oil exports to North Korea.\nIf China won\u2019t move, Trump could impose second-order sanctions on Chinese companies that deal with North Korea\u2014 locking banks out of the critical U.S. financial system, for example. Previous administrations have avoided such a step for fear of angering Beijing. For its part, North Korea shows no signs of changing course as it tests missiles and threatens nuclear war. \u201cWhen you normalize provocations, and then people will think, \u2018Oh, yeah, the North Koreans, they are just doing what they do,\u2019 that\u2019s great for North Korea,\u201d says Kent Boydston, a Korea expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Beware the crazy-uncle excuse.\nIt was one of his first and most prominent pledges: a big, beautiful wall on America\u2019s southern border, which would be paid for by Mexico because of the Donald\u2019s negotiating acumen.\nWithin days of taking office, Trump signed an executive order to start \u201cimmediate construction of a physical wall\u201d along with other border security measures. But he needs Congress to follow through with the money, as Mexico\u2019s president has made it clear he\u2019s disinclined to write a check for the wall. Trump has responded with vague pledges about how Mexico might pay indirectly.\nEventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.\nSo how much will the great wall cost? The Trump administration requested $4.1 billion over two years, but that\u2019s a fraction of what a physical barrier across the entire border would cost. Senate Democrats extrapolated from prototype proposals that a 1,827-mile wall would cost at least $64 billion \u2014 and $150 million more per year to maintain. An internal Department of Homeland Security analysis, Reuters reports, pegged the cost at $21.4 billion to shore up the 1,250 miles of the border that are not already fortified.\nDemocrats are digging in, vowing to block any spending bill that includes wall money \u2014 and for more than fiscal reasons. \u201cIt stems from a value: Are you somebody who sees the humanity in our neighbors, or are you not?\u201d asks Faiz Shakir, national political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is pushing Democrats to stand firm. The result was Trump backing off his demand to include wall funding in a government spending bill, postponing the fight.\nThis is in part because even border-state Republicans who are hawkish on immigration say electronic surveillance in some places might be preferable to a barrier. And the government would have to seize some property under eminent domain to build a wall, a tactic not likely to sit well with landowners. The Houston Chronicle recently quoted House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, telling local college students: \u201cI don\u2019t think a 30-foot concrete wall is going to be the answer.\u201d\nThe easygoing investigator who could derail the presidency\nThe topic was serious, the tone sober when Republican Sen. Richard Burr shared a news conference podium with Democrat Mark Warner to talk about Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their investigation of it. But Burr wore a slight smirk when setting a ground rule in his light North Carolina drawl: \u201cWe will not take questions on the House Intelligence Committee.\u201d\nAs the Russia investigation unfolds, it\u2019s the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence who will be charged with maintaining the professionalism and bipartisanship critical to making the probe credible. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who soaked up the attention during the first 100 days, showed himself too chummy with Trump to assess impartially whether the president\u2019s campaign collaborated with foreign interests, and he stepped aside from leading the probe. Thus, Burr has taken center stage in the casual manner he handles most everything else.\nBurr is known around the Capitol for his quirks \u2014 wearing loafers without socks, driving a 1974 open-air Volkswagen Thing \u2014 and for being tight with former house speaker John Boehner. Burr took over the chairmanship of the intelligence committee early in 2015. It\u2019s a job that makes one privy to the nation\u2019s darkest secrets and biggest fears, and it requires lots of time locked away with classified materials, unreachable to the outside world. Burr\u2019s longtime political consultant Paul Shumaker tells OZY that Burr told him early on: \u201cThere would be times in his re-election that we would have to run a campaign without a candidate, because he was going to put that responsibility of the committee chairmanship first.\u201d\nBurr\u2019s lack of interest in campaigning was often interpreted in D.C. circles as laziness, but he won an unexpectedly tight race last year and says his third term in the Senate will be his last. Though he typically votes the party line, Burr is now free of political shackles as he pursues the ties between Moscow and Trump Tower. Last year Burr was more steadfast than many GOP senators in supporting Trump, and Yahoo! News recently reported growing frustration among the committee\u2019s Democrats that Burr is slow-walking the probe. If it appears to be tainted by politics, pressure will grow for a special prosecutor to come in. Ask Ken Starr and Bill Clinton how that works out.\nIn late April, Trump sat at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office surrounded by steel industry honchos to sign an executive order to \u201cprioritize\u201d an investigation into the effects of low-cost steel imports, implicitly targeting China, a familiar trade foe. Then Trump\u2019s focus shifted to what appeared to be handwritten notes and an unusual target inspired by a visit to Wisconsin two days earlier: \u201cIn Canada, what they\u2019ve done to our dairy farm workers is a disgrace.\u201d The \u201cNAFTA disaster,\u201d as Trump termed it, has to do with our northern neighbor\u2019s market protections for its dairy farmers. Then last week, he slapped a tariff on Canadian soft lumber imports. Along with cheap Mexican manufacturing, it\u2019s part of his argument to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been in force since 1994.\nTrade policy was one of the most consistent planks of Trump\u2019s campaign. He immediately pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership upon taking office, but that treaty was never ratified. Trump last week said he was backing off plans to pull out of NAFTA altogether, and would start fresh negotiations with Ottawa and Mexico City. Opening up a long-standing deal will take more time and finesse, though commerce secretary Wilbur Ross recently said a revamped NAFTA might look a lot like what Mexico and Canada agreed to in the TPP \u2014 such as tougher labor and environmental standards. Though most of Trump\u2019s moves so far have been rhetorical, with pledged reviews and investigations, the Canadian lumber action is the first sign of teeth, with more to come over the next 100 days.\nBut in the wake of the summit with President Xi Jinping, Trump notably backed down from a campaign pledge to label China a currency manipulator, a move that would lead to tariffs and other punishments. The policy whiplash is often seen as the reflection of the internal struggle between senior counselor Steve Bannon\u2019s economic nationalism and a more moderate approach from chief economic adviser Gary Cohn\u2019s crowd, a debate not likely to go away anytime soon.\nWashington\u2019s most scrutinized \u2014 and at times inscrutable \u2014 octogenarian has a choice to make in June. Anthony Kennedy will decide whether to hang up his robe as the Supreme Court\u2019s swing justice. Though high court retirements are as tough to predict as their decisions, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the head of the Judiciary Committee that would consider a replacement, recently told constituents in Iowa that he expects a SCOTUS vacancy this summer.\nOn an evenly split court, Kennedy has tilted conservative on some issues (gun rights, campaign finance) and liberal on others (gay rights, affirmative action). Most critically for the fight to come over his seat, Kennedy has repeatedly upheld a woman\u2019s right to an abortion. Add an antiabortion justice, and the legally questionable 1973 ruling Roe v. Wade easily could tumble.\nThe filibuster already has fallen for Supreme Court nominees in this year\u2019s partisan battle over Neil Gorsuch, so the next justice will face a 50-vote threshold in the Senate. Still, the higher ideological stakes than the Gorsuch\u2013for\u2013Antonin Scalia swap means \u201cthe battle for Kennedy\u2019s seat will be Armageddon and will likely take a long while in the Senate,\u201d says Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\nIf Armageddon arrives, keep an eye on whether Trump sticks to the list of conservative Federalist Society\u2013approved judges he put out during the campaign, and the signals from GOP moderates Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. And remember Kennedy himself was Ronald Reagan\u2019s third choice, after the defeat of the severely conservative Robert Bork and the withdrawal of Douglas Ginsburg who \u2014 gasp! \u2014 admitted to smoking marijuana a few times.\nIf you take a walk, I\u2019ll tax your feet\nFor decades, blowing up the tax code has been the Washington equivalent of Tantalus\u2019 apple from Greek mythology: always just out of reach. Everyone \u2014 except, perhaps, the nation\u2019s accountants \u2014 agrees that the code is too complex, but every deduction has a lobby attached. Just before the end of his first 100 days in office, Trump announced an outline to slash tax rates for individuals and corporations. Now comes the hard part: steering it through Congress.\nRepublicans propose that most families will be able to fill out their taxes on a postcard, with a juiced-up standard deduction or itemized deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving but nothing else. Democrats have sent mixed signals about whether they\u2019d be open to working with Republicans on the plan. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he wants Trump to release his own taxes first \u2014 an exceedingly unlikely proposition and a nod to Democrats\u2019 protest-minded base.\nRepublicans remain divided over the \u201cborder adjustment tax\u201d on imports, designed to help American manufacturers and offset the deficit impact of the rate cuts. \u201cThere\u2019s no pleasant way to raise $2 trillion,\u201d says Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and an OZY contributor. Norquist adds that his reply to any business complaining about a border tax when the corporate rate has been cut from 35 percent to 15 percent would be: \u201cShut up.\u201d The border adjustment tax was not in last week\u2019s White House outline, which on its own is likely to increase the deficit, meaning congressional rules would force the tax cuts to expire after 10 years rather than become permanent. As the debate unfolds, look out for competing analyses from the White House predicting huge growth and lower deficits and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\nAnother barometer to watch: the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It has jumped more than 10 percent since Election Day, in part on the promise of a regulation- and tax-slashing presidency. Trump has started to deliver on the former. The latter will be a slog.\nThose are the issues we can see coming. Because it\u2019s Donald Trump, there\u2019s always the chance for a wild-card moment, particularly as the country gorges on the latest dramatics in As the West Wing Turns. Perhaps Bannon will end up ambassador to Liechtenstein by the time we hit Day 200.",

                "html": "<p>Shakespeare couldn&rsquo;t have written two better foils when Elizabeth Prelogar and <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/meet-trumps-supreme-court-pick-brett-kavanaugh/86827\">Brett Kavanaugh</a> squared off in a makeshift courtroom that December night in 2016. The former Miss Idaho was a prosecutor &mdash; an appellate attorney to the U.S. solicitor general &mdash; and a Democrat who had donated to the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Kavanaugh, then a judge with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, was a member of the conservative Federal Society who would later spark liberal outrage with his appointment to the Supreme Court by Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>Despite their differences, fate had brought them to Washington&rsquo;s Shakespeare Theatre Company for a mock trial of Friar Laurence for the &ldquo;wrongful death&rdquo; of Romeo and Juliet. And through the comedic evening, their similar wit emerged. When Prelogar introduced Taylor Swift&rsquo;s &ldquo;Love Story&rdquo; into the record, Kavanaugh noted that the song replaced Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragic ending with a happy one. &ldquo;This court can&rsquo;t rewrite history like that &mdash; we&rsquo;re not the Ninth Circuit,&rdquo; he said, a dig at the West Coast appellate court&rsquo;s progressive bent. &ldquo;They have tried to impugn [the friar&rsquo;s] character. And to that I say: When they go low, he goes high. Really, really high. He&rsquo;s with Him,&rdquo; Prelogar said, pointing to the heavens with a political nod (to Michelle Obama) of her own.</p>\n<p>If all the world is a stage, then Prelogar is poised to become one of its major players. The 39-year-old fluent Russian speaker worked as a top prosecutor for special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation into Moscow&rsquo;s meddling in the 2016 election while on loan from the U.S. Solicitor General&rsquo;s office, reportedly tasked with research and interviewing key witnesses. Before that, she clerked for Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. Kavanaugh, too, clerked on the highest court (for Justice Anthony Kennedy) before serving on a special counsel investigation (for <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/opinion/the-mueller-thread-how-ken-starrs-leaks-could-help-trump/93005\">Ken Starr&rsquo;s Bill Clinton probe</a>). Which makes it worth wondering: Is Prelogar headed toward a future that looks more like Mueller&rsquo;s or Kavanaugh&rsquo;s?</p>\n<blockquote> <p>She&rsquo;s made Forrest Gump&ndash;like cameos in the lives of those making news in national politics today. </p> </blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;There are several facets that are important to presidents when they nominate &mdash; and some of that dovetails with Elizabeth,&rdquo; says Adam Feldman, a court scholar who runs the blog Empirical SCOTUS (neither Prelogar nor the solicitor general&rsquo;s office responded to requests for comment).</p>\n<p>While any such forecast is fraught with hypotheticals, Prelogar seems poised for a possible judgeship or a long career as a prosecutor, particularly under a potential future Democratic president. She has already argued six Supreme Court cases since 2014, including the historic first argument of the 2016 term, which had an equal number of men (five justices) and women (three justices, two attorneys) considering a case bearing on the issue of double jeopardy in <em>Bravo-Fernandez v. United States</em>. The year prior, less than 20 percent of the lawyers appearing before the court had been women. Feldman is aware of only one other instance where women stood on equal footing with men in a Supreme Court case. That experience, plus her youth, is an advantage. &ldquo;The legacy aspect is big,&rdquo; Feldman notes: Presidents want to see their picks stay on the court for decades.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Unnamed\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/c-d-d-unnamed.jpg?w=266&is-pending-load=1\" src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/c-d-d-unnamed.jpg?w=266&is-pending-load=1\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img><figcaption>Elizabeth Prelogar as Miss Idaho.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;She definitely has a stage presence that is not typical for a high-powered lawyer &hellip; she is personable, has a lot of wit,&rdquo; says David Lat, the founder of the legal profession news site Above the Law, who has met Prelogar and followed her career. Her work at high-powered law firm Hogan Lovells could pay off during a confirmation, Lat says, when she can retort to Republicans: &ldquo;How much of a leftist can I be?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Still, the donations to Obama and Clinton could hurt her if she ever faces a nomination process from a Republican Senate, or if she&rsquo;s ever considered as a Mueller-style, nonpartisan figure to investigate a president. And before she gets on any Supreme short lists, she&rsquo;d likely need to serve time as a judge to show the kind of reliable ideological bent presidents have come to count on for their high court nominees.</p>\n<p>Regardless, there is time for Prelogar to don a judge&rsquo;s robes &mdash; a far cry from the gowns she wore years ago as a head-turning beauty queen. She shone there, too, winning the &ldquo;Triple Crown&rdquo; of pageants: Miss Teen Idaho (1998), Miss Idaho USA (2001) and Miss Idaho (2004). As a slogan-bearer for the state, Prelogar honed her voice, showing a particular softness to the children she met. &ldquo;As long as I brought the crown with me, it was easy to get them to listen,&rdquo; she told Emory College, where she was an undergraduate, after becoming a Rhodes Scholarship national finalist in 2002. &ldquo;Then afterward, they would all want to try it on &mdash; even the boys.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Following a master&rsquo;s in creative writing at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, she was accepted to Harvard Law &mdash; but deferred to pursue a yearlong Fulbright Scholarship in St. Petersburg, where she won an Overseas Press Club Foundation award for <a href=\"https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/GEdAssistantwebsite,_newFile_UpdatesFeb_2007_Vol_120DEVO_07.pdf\">an essay</a> documenting censorship of the Russian press. Her interest stemmed from wanting to read the great Russian authors in their native language. &ldquo;Now I can read poetry in the original, which is wonderful because in poetry especially so much is lost in translation,&rdquo; she told Emory.</p>\n<p>An interesting twist to Prelogar&rsquo;s story is her Forrest Gump&ndash;like cameos in the lives of those making news in national politics today. She was a contender in the 2001 Miss USA contest where Trump (who owned the competition as part of the <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/flashback/before-there-was-miss-universe-there-was-miss-subways/91229\">Miss Universe</a> umbrella) was later accused of purposefully walking in on half-dressed and naked contestants on multiple occasions. And before working for Ginsburg and Kagan, Prelogar clerked for Merrick Garland, the D.C. Circuit Court judge Republicans famously refused to consider for the Supreme Court in 2016.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Img 5189\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/img_5189.jpg?w=660&is-pending-load=1\" src=\"https://www.ozy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/img_5189.jpg?w=660&is-pending-load=1\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img><figcaption>Prelogar during her time at international law firm Hogan Lovells.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Those instances, in addition to her comedic bout with Kavanaugh and others, matter more than mere kismet. They illuminate her status as a capital insider, Feldman says, which bodes well for her chances of being nominated to the D.C. Circuit one day &mdash; a feeder for the highest court: &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s an interest of hers, she knows the right people.&rdquo; Soon her mock court sparring could become Washington reality.</p>\n<p><em>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/opinion/the-mueller-thread-whats-next-for-the-special-counsel/93411\">What&rsquo;s next</a> for the special counsel?</em></p>",

                "text": "Shakespeare couldn\u2019t have written two better foils when Elizabeth Prelogar and Brett Kavanaugh squared off in a makeshift courtroom that December night in 2016. The former Miss Idaho was a prosecutor \u2014 an appellate attorney to the U.S. solicitor general \u2014 and a Democrat who had donated to the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Kavanaugh, then a judge with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, was a member of the conservative Federal Society who would later spark liberal outrage with his appointment to the Supreme Court by Donald Trump.\nDespite their differences, fate had brought them to Washington\u2019s Shakespeare Theatre Company for a mock trial of Friar Laurence for the \u201cwrongful death\u201d of Romeo and Juliet. And through the comedic evening, their similar wit emerged. When Prelogar introduced Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLove Story\u201d into the record, Kavanaugh noted that the song replaced Shakespeare\u2019s tragic ending with a happy one. \u201cThis court can\u2019t rewrite history like that \u2014 we\u2019re not the Ninth Circuit,\u201d he said, a dig at the West Coast appellate court\u2019s progressive bent. \u201cThey have tried to impugn [the friar\u2019s] character. And to that I say: When they go low, he goes high. Really, really high. He\u2019s with Him,\u201d Prelogar said, pointing to the heavens with a political nod (to Michelle Obama) of her own.\nIf all the world is a stage, then Prelogar is poised to become one of its major players. The 39-year-old fluent Russian speaker worked as a top prosecutor for special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation into Moscow\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election while on loan from the U.S. Solicitor General\u2019s office, reportedly tasked with research and interviewing key witnesses. Before that, she clerked for Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. Kavanaugh, too, clerked on the highest court (for Justice Anthony Kennedy) before serving on a special counsel investigation (for Ken Starr\u2019s Bill Clinton probe). Which makes it worth wondering: Is Prelogar headed toward a future that looks more like Mueller\u2019s or Kavanaugh\u2019s?\nShe\u2019s made Forrest Gump\u2013like cameos in the lives of those making news in national politics today.\n\u201cThere are several facets that are important to presidents when they nominate \u2014 and some of that dovetails with Elizabeth,\u201d says Adam Feldman, a court scholar who runs the blog Empirical SCOTUS (neither Prelogar nor the solicitor general\u2019s office responded to requests for comment).\nWhile any such forecast is fraught with hypotheticals, Prelogar seems poised for a possible judgeship or a long career as a prosecutor, particularly under a potential future Democratic president. She has already argued six Supreme Court cases since 2014, including the historic first argument of the 2016 term, which had an equal number of men (five justices) and women (three justices, two attorneys) considering a case bearing on the issue of double jeopardy in Bravo-Fernandez v. United States. The year prior, less than 20 percent of the lawyers appearing before the court had been women. Feldman is aware of only one other instance where women stood on equal footing with men in a Supreme Court case. That experience, plus her youth, is an advantage. \u201cThe legacy aspect is big,\u201d Feldman notes: Presidents want to see their picks stay on the court for decades.\n\u201cShe definitely has a stage presence that is not typical for a high-powered lawyer \u2026 she is personable, has a lot of wit,\u201d says David Lat, the founder of the legal profession news site Above the Law, who has met Prelogar and followed her career. Her work at high-powered law firm Hogan Lovells could pay off during a confirmation, Lat says, when she can retort to Republicans: \u201cHow much of a leftist can I be?\u201d\nStill, the donations to Obama and Clinton could hurt her if she ever faces a nomination process from a Republican Senate, or if she\u2019s ever considered as a Mueller-style, nonpartisan figure to investigate a president. And before she gets on any Supreme short lists, she\u2019d likely need to serve time as a judge to show the kind of reliable ideological bent presidents have come to count on for their high court nominees.\nRegardless, there is time for Prelogar to don a judge\u2019s robes \u2014 a far cry from the gowns she wore years ago as a head-turning beauty queen. She shone there, too, winning the \u201cTriple Crown\u201d of pageants: Miss Teen Idaho (1998), Miss Idaho USA (2001) and Miss Idaho (2004). As a slogan-bearer for the state, Prelogar honed her voice, showing a particular softness to the children she met. \u201cAs long as I brought the crown with me, it was easy to get them to listen,\u201d she told Emory College, where she was an undergraduate, after becoming a Rhodes Scholarship national finalist in 2002. \u201cThen afterward, they would all want to try it on \u2014 even the boys.\u201d\nFollowing a master\u2019s in creative writing at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, she was accepted to Harvard Law \u2014 but deferred to pursue a yearlong Fulbright Scholarship in St. Petersburg, where she won an Overseas Press Club Foundation award for an essay documenting censorship of the Russian press. Her interest stemmed from wanting to read the great Russian authors in their native language. \u201cNow I can read poetry in the original, which is wonderful because in poetry especially so much is lost in translation,\u201d she told Emory.\nAn interesting twist to Prelogar\u2019s story is her Forrest Gump\u2013like cameos in the lives of those making news in national politics today. She was a contender in the 2001 Miss USA contest where Trump (who owned the competition as part of the Miss Universe umbrella) was later accused of purposefully walking in on half-dressed and naked contestants on multiple occasions. And before working for Ginsburg and Kagan, Prelogar clerked for Merrick Garland, the D.C. Circuit Court judge Republicans famously refused to consider for the Supreme Court in 2016.\nThose instances, in addition to her comedic bout with Kavanaugh and others, matter more than mere kismet. They illuminate her status as a capital insider, Feldman says, which bodes well for her chances of being nominated to the D.C. Circuit one day \u2014 a feeder for the highest court: \u201cIf that\u2019s an interest of hers, she knows the right people.\u201d Soon her mock court sparring could become Washington reality.\nRead more: What\u2019s next for the special counsel?",

                "html": "<p>It was the very first event of the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, and Candace Owens could hardly believe she was speaking. &ldquo;I uploaded a video onto <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/now-youtube-kills-the-radio-star/82122\">YouTube</a> five months ago, and I am sitting on the CPAC stage today,&rdquo; the 28-year-old said, a made-to-inspire nod to more than 1,000 acolytes gathered for her panel titled &ldquo;An Affair to Remember: How the Far Left and the Mainstream Media Got in Bed Together.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Two years ago, she was a liberal in Stamford, Connecticut, trying to start an online database to allow social media users to report online bullying &mdash; a nod to her own traumatic racial harassment as a high school track athlete and cheerleader. But Owens was criticized by progressives concerned the site, Social Autopsy, could be abused to &ldquo;dox&rdquo; innocent people. The backlash led in part to her political conversion. She watched as mainstream outlets shamed her, in her view. The only site that covered the story accurately was the &ldquo;white, nationalist&rdquo; Breitbart News, she said to Dave Rubin, a YouTube news personality. This was in April 2016, and Owens found confirmation in Trump, who was on the television near daily claiming the media was lying. &ldquo;I realized my friends were my enemies, and my enemies were my friends,&rdquo; Owens says.</p>\n<blockquote> <p>We are living in such a special time. We are watching the slow, and painful, death of the mainstream media.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Owens says she spent a year to &ldquo;rebuild as a person,&rdquo; shell-shocked by the negative coverage of Social Autopsy. Now she is a brimstone-raining headliner for Republican rallies. Her first video, featuring her satirically &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; to her parents as a conservative, drew a quarter-million views after its posting last August. It has since spawned dozens more under her channel, Red Pill Black, a nod to <em>The Matrix</em> and her purported political awakening. Armed with undeniable charisma and a well-sculpted persona, her online popularity has led to appearances on Fox News and dozens of radio, TV and online appearances, carried on the back of videos like &ldquo;How to Escape the Democrat Plantation&rdquo; and, her most popular one thus far, &ldquo;WTF? <a href=\"http://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/will-black-lives-matter-win-hollywood/75402\">Black Lives Matter</a> Has a List of Demands for White People!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The director of urban engagement for Turning Point USA, a nonprofit engaging young conservatives, Owens appears poised to break through from internet famous to actual famous. In the whirlwind of CPAC, she took selfies with Chris Loesch (husband and manager of media personality/NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch), rubbed elbows with Sebastian Gorka (bombastic fired Trump White House aide turned Fox News pundit) and then sprinted off to a meeting at the Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. The latter trumped an interview with OZY, as it turned out, though she texted us her apologies: &ldquo;This day has been impossible.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><iframe data-height=\"281\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/085u0NnAgjA?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not difficult to see why Owens is in such demand. Outspoken Black conservatives often soar to stardom quickly as Republicans seek to elevate their comparatively few minority voices. Their moments can be fleeting, but the former <em>Vogue </em>employee and University of Rhode Island journalism grad has the chops to stick around. Her direct-to-camera appeals are filled with fury, but also an acerbic wit reminiscent of Tomi Lahren&rsquo;s star-making &ldquo;final thoughts&rdquo; segments on TheBlaze &mdash; except more clever.</p>\n<p>In that sense, Owens is more Omarosa Manigault-Newman, the skilled if confounding agitator who turned her <em>Apprentice </em>appearances into a White House gig, than Diamond and Silk, the YouTube personalities who opened Trump campaign rallies with a shtick crossing into the absurd. Owens praises Trump&rsquo;s tax cuts and his cultural stances, but rarely advocates specific policies (she has said she supports gay marriage but hasn&rsquo;t arrived at a position yet on abortion)<strong>.</strong> Her online persona&rsquo;s most consistent belief is outrage. &ldquo;Black people are not a monolith,&rdquo; she says in another broadside aimed at &ldquo;the media.&rdquo; &ldquo;We all have different ideas, and I hope they keep pretending we don&rsquo;t exist, because that&rsquo;s the exact market I&rsquo;m after.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But her authenticity has come under question. Other vloggers note that Owens once wrote the tea party was &ldquo;bat-shit crazy&rdquo; in a post for Degree180, a news site she helped found after leaving a private equity firm in 2015. Her overnight ascent has frustrated other African-American Republicans, inspiring intense, and perhaps envious, reactions. Wayne Dupree, a conservative blogger and award-winning podcast host, interviewed Owens. But when asked by email to comment on her, he wondered why this story wasn&rsquo;t about him. Eugene Craig, a former vice chairman of the Maryland GOP, said he considers Owens &ldquo;an opportunistic person who, for the development of her own celebrity, uses and attacks Black culture while claiming to do minority engagement.&rdquo; He criticizes her for posting videos mocking Colin Kaepernick, the protesting quarterback. &ldquo;So original,&rdquo; Craig gripes. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a Tomi Lahren in blackface.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Of course, Lahren, now a Fox News contributor, has achieved incredible success to ease her notoriety for racially charged statements. And Owens could too, helped by a shift from traditional media &mdash; which the Edelman Trust Barometer recently reported has become &ldquo;the least trusted institution&rdquo; globally &mdash; that has buoyed the careers of everyone from Lahren to Ben Shapiro, the Daily Wire editor in chief and popular podcaster. As conservatives have gone from railing against the mainstream media to abandoning it altogether, they&rsquo;ll tune in to new platforms and new people like Owens. &ldquo;We are living in such a special time. We are watching the slow, and painful, death of the mainstream media,&rdquo; she said at CPAC, joining a co-panelist to &ldquo;wave goodbye&rdquo; to the media gathered in the back. &ldquo;It was fun standing up there and pointing to them, saying, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re fake news! You&rsquo;re <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/provocateurs/on-the-front-line-of-the-battle-against-fake-news/83548\">fake news</a>! You&rsquo;re fake news!&rsquo;&rdquo; Owens said in her subsequent radio interview with Dupree, reveling in the spectacle. &ldquo;I felt like Donald Trump there for a second.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "It was the very first event of the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, and Candace Owens could hardly believe she was speaking. \u201cI uploaded a video onto YouTube five months ago, and I am sitting on the CPAC stage today,\u201d the 28-year-old said, a made-to-inspire nod to more than 1,000 acolytes gathered for her panel titled \u201cAn Affair to Remember: How the Far Left and the Mainstream Media Got in Bed Together.\u201d\nTwo years ago, she was a liberal in Stamford, Connecticut, trying to start an online database to allow social media users to report online bullying \u2014 a nod to her own traumatic racial harassment as a high school track athlete and cheerleader. But Owens was criticized by progressives concerned the site, Social Autopsy, could be abused to \u201cdox\u201d innocent people. The backlash led in part to her political conversion. She watched as mainstream outlets shamed her, in her view. The only site that covered the story accurately was the \u201cwhite, nationalist\u201d Breitbart News, she said to Dave Rubin, a YouTube news personality. This was in April 2016, and Owens found confirmation in Trump, who was on the television near daily claiming the media was lying. \u201cI realized my friends were my enemies, and my enemies were my friends,\u201d Owens says.\nWe are living in such a special time. We are watching the slow, and painful, death of the mainstream media.\nOwens says she spent a year to \u201crebuild as a person,\u201d shell-shocked by the negative coverage of Social Autopsy. Now she is a brimstone-raining headliner for Republican rallies. Her first video, featuring her satirically \u201ccoming out\u201d to her parents as a conservative, drew a quarter-million views after its posting last August. It has since spawned dozens more under her channel, Red Pill Black, a nod to The Matrix and her purported political awakening. Armed with undeniable charisma and a well-sculpted persona, her online popularity has led to appearances on Fox News and dozens of radio, TV and online appearances, carried on the back of videos like \u201cHow to Escape the Democrat Plantation\u201d and, her most popular one thus far, \u201cWTF? Black Lives Matter Has a List of Demands for White People!\u201d\nThe director of urban engagement for Turning Point USA, a nonprofit engaging young conservatives, Owens appears poised to break through from internet famous to actual famous. In the whirlwind of CPAC, she took selfies with Chris Loesch (husband and manager of media personality/NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch), rubbed elbows with Sebastian Gorka (bombastic fired Trump White House aide turned Fox News pundit) and then sprinted off to a meeting at the Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. The latter trumped an interview with OZY, as it turned out, though she texted us her apologies: \u201cThis day has been impossible.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not difficult to see why Owens is in such demand. Outspoken Black conservatives often soar to stardom quickly as Republicans seek to elevate their comparatively few minority voices. Their moments can be fleeting, but the former Vogue employee and University of Rhode Island journalism grad has the chops to stick around. Her direct-to-camera appeals are filled with fury, but also an acerbic wit reminiscent of Tomi Lahren\u2019s star-making \u201cfinal thoughts\u201d segments on TheBlaze \u2014 except more clever.\nIn that sense, Owens is more Omarosa Manigault-Newman, the skilled if confounding agitator who turned her Apprentice appearances into a White House gig, than Diamond and Silk, the YouTube personalities who opened Trump campaign rallies with a shtick crossing into the absurd. Owens praises Trump\u2019s tax cuts and his cultural stances, but rarely advocates specific policies (she has said she supports gay marriage but hasn\u2019t arrived at a position yet on abortion). Her online persona\u2019s most consistent belief is outrage. \u201cBlack people are not a monolith,\u201d she says in another broadside aimed at \u201cthe media.\u201d \u201cWe all have different ideas, and I hope they keep pretending we don\u2019t exist, because that\u2019s the exact market I\u2019m after.\u201d\nBut her authenticity has come under question. Other vloggers note that Owens once wrote the tea party was \u201cbat-shit crazy\u201d in a post for Degree180, a news site she helped found after leaving a private equity firm in 2015. Her overnight ascent has frustrated other African-American Republicans, inspiring intense, and perhaps envious, reactions. Wayne Dupree, a conservative blogger and award-winning podcast host, interviewed Owens. But when asked by email to comment on her, he wondered why this story wasn\u2019t about him. Eugene Craig, a former vice chairman of the Maryland GOP, said he considers Owens \u201can opportunistic person who, for the development of her own celebrity, uses and attacks Black culture while claiming to do minority engagement.\u201d He criticizes her for posting videos mocking Colin Kaepernick, the protesting quarterback. \u201cSo original,\u201d Craig gripes. \u201cShe\u2019s a Tomi Lahren in blackface.\u201d\nOf course, Lahren, now a Fox News contributor, has achieved incredible success to ease her notoriety for racially charged statements. And Owens could too, helped by a shift from traditional media \u2014 which the Edelman Trust Barometer recently reported has become \u201cthe least trusted institution\u201d globally \u2014 that has buoyed the careers of everyone from Lahren to Ben Shapiro, the Daily Wire editor in chief and popular podcaster. As conservatives have gone from railing against the mainstream media to abandoning it altogether, they\u2019ll tune in to new platforms and new people like Owens. \u201cWe are living in such a special time. We are watching the slow, and painful, death of the mainstream media,\u201d she said at CPAC, joining a co-panelist to \u201cwave goodbye\u201d to the media gathered in the back. \u201cIt was fun standing up there and pointing to them, saying, \u2018You\u2019re fake news! You\u2019re fake news! You\u2019re fake news!\u2019\u201d Owens said in her subsequent radio interview with Dupree, reveling in the spectacle. \u201cI felt like Donald Trump there for a second.\u201d",

                "html": "<p>Margaret Van Vliet had long <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/opinion/trumps-triumphs-the-case-for-45/90210\">known who Donald Trump</a> was. She had seen him at a few well-to-do New York City parties, and often when she was visiting the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for business. But it wasn&rsquo;t until they crossed paths at a private Atlanta hangar that they spoke for the first time. Trump was going up a set of stairs: Van Vliet was going down them. As they passed each other, Van Vliet could feel Trump&rsquo;s eyes scan her body. &ldquo;Where do you think his eyes rested? Right on my crotch,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p>The anger in Van Vliet&rsquo;s voice is not what you would expect to hear on a quiet Saturday morning at Le Pain Quotidien in downtown Greenwich. But in this Connecticut town best known for its tony privilege, manners and restraint, Trump&rsquo;s name inspires strong feelings of aversion even among lifelong Republicans like Van Vliet, who voted for every GOP presidential candidate from Ronald Reagan to Mitt Romney and whose grandfather was a GOP state senator.</p>\n<p>That sentiment is spreading across wealthy Fairfield County, commonly referred to as the Gold Coast of Connecticut. The concern isn&rsquo;t just about a Trump-approved tax bill that disproportionately damaged wealthy homeowners in high-tax states like this, although for some, that was damning. No, the criticism is much more elemental. &ldquo;His whole persona is just so insulting to me, and to the women in this area,&rdquo; Van Vliet, 61, says. And that&rsquo;s hurting the Republican Party in a former bastion.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Gold Coast is where the Bush family had its roots, from Prescott to George Sr., and these ritzy towns spawned GOP Reps. Stewart McKinney and Chris Shays &mdash; before 2016, when they flipped from easy victories for Romney to landslide wins for Hillary Clinton. That leftward shift continued in the 2018 midterms, two years into Trump&rsquo;s presidency. And while it likely won&rsquo;t affect the Electoral College &mdash; no Republican has won Connecticut&rsquo;s seven votes since George H.W. Bush in 1988, even when the Gold Coast voted red &mdash; it could affect the GOP&rsquo;s purse strings in the 2020 presidential race and down ballot.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s particularly so because the Nutmeg State has historically been a disproportionately <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/2016/the-fundraising-guru-behind-bernie-sanders-27-dollars/68015\">lucrative gold mine for fundraisers</a>: Despite being only the 29th-biggest state, Connecticut was the 19th-highest source of political donations last cycle. &ldquo;The funds raised in Connecticut don&rsquo;t stay in Connecticut,&rdquo; says Gayle Alberda, a political scientist at Fairfield University. &ldquo;They go to the swing states that are purple &mdash; and they need them to get across the finish line.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The numbers don&rsquo;t lie: Conservative bankrollers have ceded serious ground since Trump became president. In the 2013&ndash;14 midterms, Connecticut donors gave $15 million to Democrats and $14 million to Republicans, essentially a draw. But in the 2017&ndash;18 midterms, Connecticut donors gave $24.5 million to Democrats and just $11.5 million to Republicans, according to Federal Election Commission data gathered by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. In federal elections across the state, nearly four-fifths of all donations to candidates went to liberal contenders.</p>\n<p>The voting booth reflects a similar shift. Republican voter registration dropped in Hartford suburbs such as Simsbury and Glastonbury. Avon, one of those Gold Coast towns, saw Democratic registration increase by 100 while Republican registration fell from 4,145 after the 2016 election to 3,969. To add insult to injury, 22-year-old Democrat Will Haskell, a Georgetown graduate and recent intern to Sen. Chris Murphy, upset a two-decade incumbent to win the 26th state Senate district &mdash; held by Republicans since the 1970s.</p>\n<p>Trump has put a lot of Yankee Republicans in a &ldquo;tricky situation, because you may still have traditional Republican values, but you don&rsquo;t agree with the leader of the party,&rdquo; Alberda says. That has alienated the Greenwich elite types while also helping the Republican Party see major growth in more rural parts of the state, such as eastern Connecticut, as well as in working-class regions like the Naugatuck Valley, reflective of the way Trump has recast conservatism nationwide.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Trump isn&rsquo;t the only reason why the Gold Coast is changing its voting patterns. It&rsquo;s a demographic effect too. The state is seeing a brain drain, with higher-earning residents leaving (oftentimes for lower-tax states), which leaves more small-donation voters who typically lean Democrat, says Alberda. An analysis by The Connecticut Mirror shortly after the midterms showed that cities and towns where Latinos made up more than 25 percent of the population saw significant increases in turnout. Connecticut is now 15 percent Hispanic, the 11th-largest share of any state and by far the most diverse in lily-white New England. Greenwich, in particular, has become a much more diverse city in recent decades, with <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/acumen/for-the-third-year-in-a-row-no-one-is-moving-to-connecticut/81465\">non-White residents &mdash; who, on average, are much more likely to vote Democrat &mdash; growing</a> from around 10 percent in the 2000 census to around 26 percent of the current population.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s struggles with well-educated women make a Republican rebound even harder here. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really morally opposed to him,&rdquo; says Greenwich resident Kim Parent, a former Republican, who, along with her husband, can&rsquo;t stomach backing Trump. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not that party-devoted that I would vote for it at any cost.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Will the party shift stick? Parent and Van Vliet say their vote is lost to this version of the Republican Party. It&rsquo;s hard to forecast too far ahead though, and only time can tell if this is a lasting trend or a one-off. Either way, there&rsquo;s still much at stake in Connecticut for the GOP. The state&rsquo;s governor races and two of its five U.S. House seats are competitive for the right candidate. And across the country, every Republican candidate, from the president to dogcatcher, would love to mine the Gold Coast for donations once again.</p>",

                "text": "Margaret Van Vliet had long known who Donald Trump was. She had seen him at a few well-to-do New York City parties, and often when she was visiting the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for business. But it wasn\u2019t until they crossed paths at a private Atlanta hangar that they spoke for the first time. Trump was going up a set of stairs: Van Vliet was going down them. As they passed each other, Van Vliet could feel Trump\u2019s eyes scan her body. \u201cWhere do you think his eyes rested? Right on my crotch,\u201d she says.\nThe anger in Van Vliet\u2019s voice is not what you would expect to hear on a quiet Saturday morning at Le Pain Quotidien in downtown Greenwich. But in this Connecticut town best known for its tony privilege, manners and restraint, Trump\u2019s name inspires strong feelings of aversion even among lifelong Republicans like Van Vliet, who voted for every GOP presidential candidate from Ronald Reagan to Mitt Romney and whose grandfather was a GOP state senator.\nThat sentiment is spreading across wealthy Fairfield County, commonly referred to as the Gold Coast of Connecticut. The concern isn\u2019t just about a Trump-approved tax bill that disproportionately damaged wealthy homeowners in high-tax states like this, although for some, that was damning. No, the criticism is much more elemental. \u201cHis whole persona is just so insulting to me, and to the women in this area,\u201d Van Vliet, 61, says. And that\u2019s hurting the Republican Party in a former bastion.\nIndeed, the Gold Coast is where the Bush family had its roots, from Prescott to George Sr., and these ritzy towns spawned GOP Reps. Stewart McKinney and Chris Shays \u2014 before 2016, when they flipped from easy victories for Romney to landslide wins for Hillary Clinton. That leftward shift continued in the 2018 midterms, two years into Trump\u2019s presidency. And while it likely won\u2019t affect the Electoral College \u2014 no Republican has won Connecticut\u2019s seven votes since George H.W. Bush in 1988, even when the Gold Coast voted red \u2014 it could affect the GOP\u2019s purse strings in the 2020 presidential race and down ballot.\nThat\u2019s particularly so because the Nutmeg State has historically been a disproportionately lucrative gold mine for fundraisers: Despite being only the 29th-biggest state, Connecticut was the 19th-highest source of political donations last cycle. \u201cThe funds raised in Connecticut don\u2019t stay in Connecticut,\u201d says Gayle Alberda, a political scientist at Fairfield University. \u201cThey go to the swing states that are purple \u2014 and they need them to get across the finish line.\u201d\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie: Conservative bankrollers have ceded serious ground since Trump became president. In the 2013\u201314 midterms, Connecticut donors gave $15 million to Democrats and $14 million to Republicans, essentially a draw. But in the 2017\u201318 midterms, Connecticut donors gave $24.5 million to Democrats and just $11.5 million to Republicans, according to Federal Election Commission data gathered by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. In federal elections across the state, nearly four-fifths of all donations to candidates went to liberal contenders.\nThe voting booth reflects a similar shift. Republican voter registration dropped in Hartford suburbs such as Simsbury and Glastonbury. Avon, one of those Gold Coast towns, saw Democratic registration increase by 100 while Republican registration fell from 4,145 after the 2016 election to 3,969. To add insult to injury, 22-year-old Democrat Will Haskell, a Georgetown graduate and recent intern to Sen. Chris Murphy, upset a two-decade incumbent to win the 26th state Senate district \u2014 held by Republicans since the 1970s.\nTrump has put a lot of Yankee Republicans in a \u201ctricky situation, because you may still have traditional Republican values, but you don\u2019t agree with the leader of the party,\u201d Alberda says. That has alienated the Greenwich elite types while also helping the Republican Party see major growth in more rural parts of the state, such as eastern Connecticut, as well as in working-class regions like the Naugatuck Valley, reflective of the way Trump has recast conservatism nationwide.\nTo be sure, Trump isn\u2019t the only reason why the Gold Coast is changing its voting patterns. It\u2019s a demographic effect too. The state is seeing a brain drain, with higher-earning residents leaving (oftentimes for lower-tax states), which leaves more small-donation voters who typically lean Democrat, says Alberda. An analysis by The Connecticut Mirror shortly after the midterms showed that cities and towns where Latinos made up more than 25 percent of the population saw significant increases in turnout. Connecticut is now 15 percent Hispanic, the 11th-largest share of any state and by far the most diverse in lily-white New England. Greenwich, in particular, has become a much more diverse city in recent decades, with non-White residents \u2014 who, on average, are much more likely to vote Democrat \u2014 growing from around 10 percent in the 2000 census to around 26 percent of the current population.\nTrump\u2019s struggles with well-educated women make a Republican rebound even harder here. \u201cI\u2019m really morally opposed to him,\u201d says Greenwich resident Kim Parent, a former Republican, who, along with her husband, can\u2019t stomach backing Trump. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not that party-devoted that I would vote for it at any cost.\u201d\nWill the party shift stick? Parent and Van Vliet say their vote is lost to this version of the Republican Party. It\u2019s hard to forecast too far ahead though, and only time can tell if this is a lasting trend or a one-off. Either way, there\u2019s still much at stake in Connecticut for the GOP. The state\u2019s governor races and two of its five U.S. House seats are competitive for the right candidate. And across the country, every Republican candidate, from the president to dogcatcher, would love to mine the Gold Coast for donations once again.",

On Tuesday evening Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, a close ally of Donald Trump, publicly threatened to ruin Michael Cohen&rsquo;s marriage if Cohen went through with his scheduled public testimony on Wednesday about Donald Trump. Even as legal experts were debating whether Gaetz would be criminally indicted for the tweet, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi took control.</p>\n<p>Nancy Pelosi posted a tweet which didn&rsquo;t even mention Matt Gaetz by name, yet nonetheless rather clearly called for the House Ethics Committee to investigate Gaetz&rsquo;s tweet. It took Gaetz awhile to get the message, but right around midnight he signaled that he&rsquo;d finally figured out how much trouble he was in, and how afraid he is of what&rsquo;s about to happen to him.</p>\n<p>Matt Gaetz posted this tweet at 11:52pm eastern time: &ldquo;Speaker, I want to get the truth too. While it is important 2 create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen, it was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did. I&rsquo;m deleting the tweet &amp; I should have chosen words that better showed my intent. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Well, yeah, that&rsquo;s not going to cut it. We expect the House Ethics Committee to open an investigation into Matt Gaetz over the felony he very clearly (and intentionally) committed with his original tweet. We&rsquo;ll also have to wait and see if prosecutors like Robert Mueller and/or SDNY decide to criminally target Gaetz for witness tampering.</p>",

                "text": "It was the felony witness tampering tweet heard round the world. On Tuesday evening Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, a close ally of Donald Trump, publicly threatened to ruin Michael Cohen\u2019s marriage if Cohen went through with his scheduled public testimony on Wednesday about Donald Trump. Even as legal experts were debating whether Gaetz would be criminally indicted for the tweet, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi took control.\nNancy Pelosi posted a tweet which didn\u2019t even mention Matt Gaetz by name, yet nonetheless rather clearly called for the House Ethics Committee to investigate Gaetz\u2019s tweet. It took Gaetz awhile to get the message, but right around midnight he signaled that he\u2019d finally figured out how much trouble he was in, and how afraid he is of what\u2019s about to happen to him.\nMatt Gaetz posted this tweet at 11:52pm eastern time: \u201cSpeaker, I want to get the truth too. While it is important 2 create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen, it was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did. I\u2019m deleting the tweet & I should have chosen words that better showed my intent. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nWell, yeah, that\u2019s not going to cut it. We expect the House Ethics Committee to open an investigation into Matt Gaetz over the felony he very clearly (and intentionally) committed with his original tweet. We\u2019ll also have to wait and see if prosecutors like Robert Mueller and/or SDNY decide to criminally target Gaetz for witness tampering.",

Last week ended with a trio of legal setbacks for Trump in New York that would take over the news cycle in any normal presidency. With Trump, these developments are just raindrops in a growing thunderstorm of bad news.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, a New York appeals court gave Summer Zervos the green light to proceed with her defamation lawsuit against Trump. A former contestant on The Apprentice, Zervos claimed that Trump groped and kissed her without her consent. Trump denied the allegations, calling them &ldquo;100% false&rdquo; and a &ldquo;hoax.&rdquo; Zervos then sued Trump under New York law for defamation, claiming that he damaged her reputation by falsely painting her as a liar.</p>\n<p>Trump loves to trample on the Constitution except when he thinks it might protect him. In this instance, Trump tried to hide behind the Constitution&rsquo;s supremacy clause, which prevents states from interfering with the federal government&rsquo;s powers. His lawyers argued that the Constitution bars Zervos from bringing the claim because he is the President of the United States. But the court agreed with Zervos, ruling 3-2 that even presidents are not immune from state level defamation lawsuits.</p>\n<p>Also on Thursday, New York Attorney General Letitia James made a new filing in the state&rsquo;s lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation. Her office already succeeded in getting a court-supervised takedown of the Foundation in December. But now she is asking a judge to order Trump to pay a $5.6 million penalty and $2.8 million in restitution, and to ban Trump, Don Jr., Ivanka, and Eric from running any New York charity for the next decade. The filing reveals that James is armed with a wealth of &ldquo;uncontroverted evidence&rdquo; establishing that Trump &ldquo;used Foundation funds to, among other things, pay for portraits of himself; make political donations, pay for advertising for Trump hotels, settle lawsuits involving the Trump Organization, and to improperly intervene in the 2016 election.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Finally, on Friday, a federal judge in New York ruled against the Trump administration in a class-action lawsuit on immigration. Under federal law, migrants who prove they were &ldquo;abused, abandoned, or neglected&rdquo; by their parents are entitled to a pathway to lawful permanent residence. But in a blow to Trump&rsquo;s hardline immigration aspirations, a judge ruled that the Trump administration wildly misconstrued the law and illegally denied this special status to thousands of qualified people.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s new legal setbacks were no doubt one ingredient in the stew that led to his Twitter hysteria over the weekend. Trump attacked the late Senator John McCain, threatened Saturday Night Live with a federal investigation after it aired a rerun, and barked orders at Fox News. This all reflects Trump&rsquo;s growing desperation, as the &ldquo;president&rdquo; who is obsessed with winning continues losing bigly.</p>",

                "text": "Donald Trump is continuing to get hammered in court. Last week ended with a trio of legal setbacks for Trump in New York that would take over the news cycle in any normal presidency. With Trump, these developments are just raindrops in a growing thunderstorm of bad news.\nOn Thursday, a New York appeals court gave Summer Zervos the green light to proceed with her defamation lawsuit against Trump. A former contestant on The Apprentice, Zervos claimed that Trump groped and kissed her without her consent. Trump denied the allegations, calling them \u201c100% false\u201d and a \u201choax.\u201d Zervos then sued Trump under New York law for defamation, claiming that he damaged her reputation by falsely painting her as a liar.\nTrump loves to trample on the Constitution except when he thinks it might protect him. In this instance, Trump tried to hide behind the Constitution\u2019s supremacy clause, which prevents states from interfering with the federal government\u2019s powers. His lawyers argued that the Constitution bars Zervos from bringing the claim because he is the President of the United States. But the court agreed with Zervos, ruling 3-2 that even presidents are not immune from state level defamation lawsuits.\nAlso on Thursday, New York Attorney General Letitia James made a new filing in the state\u2019s lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation. Her office already succeeded in getting a court-supervised takedown of the Foundation in December. But now she is asking a judge to order Trump to pay a $5.6 million penalty and $2.8 million in restitution, and to ban Trump, Don Jr., Ivanka, and Eric from running any New York charity for the next decade. The filing reveals that James is armed with a wealth of \u201cuncontroverted evidence\u201d establishing that Trump \u201cused Foundation funds to, among other things, pay for portraits of himself; make political donations, pay for advertising for Trump hotels, settle lawsuits involving the Trump Organization, and to improperly intervene in the 2016 election.\u201d\nFinally, on Friday, a federal judge in New York ruled against the Trump administration in a class-action lawsuit on immigration. Under federal law, migrants who prove they were \u201cabused, abandoned, or neglected\u201d by their parents are entitled to a pathway to lawful permanent residence. But in a blow to Trump\u2019s hardline immigration aspirations, a judge ruled that the Trump administration wildly misconstrued the law and illegally denied this special status to thousands of qualified people.\nDonald Trump\u2019s new legal setbacks were no doubt one ingredient in the stew that led to his Twitter hysteria over the weekend. Trump attacked the late Senator John McCain, threatened Saturday Night Live with a federal investigation after it aired a rerun, and barked orders at Fox News. This all reflects Trump\u2019s growing desperation, as the \u201cpresident\u201d who is obsessed with winning continues losing bigly.",
