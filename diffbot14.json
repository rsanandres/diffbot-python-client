Mark Makela / Getty</p> </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Asked why he supported &ldquo;open borders&rdquo; at a recent Iowa town hall, Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/08/bernie-sanders-open-borders-1261392\">responded</a> that he did not.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you may be getting your information wrong &hellip; I think what we need is comprehensive immigration reform,&rdquo; said Sanders. It got worse. &ldquo;My god, there&rsquo;s a lot of poverty in this world, and you&rsquo;re going to have people from all over the world. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s something that we can do at this point. Can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Liberal critics to Bernie&rsquo;s right cynically frame comments like this one as evidence of his lack of commitment to racial justice. <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/12/bernie-sanders-racial-justice-presidential-campaign\">This is absurd</a>: Bernie has a far better record on, and program for, racial justice than members of the Democratic establishment. Bernie does, however, sometimes fail to connect the dots between his marquee economic agenda and his racial justice program. His decrying &ldquo;open borders&rdquo; was a case in point: the comment was politically unnecessary, played into a right-wing nativist trap, and misconstrued the political economy of migration.</p>\n<p>Bernie&rsquo;s track record on immigration is strong. But he currently lacks a bold vision for immigrant justice that identifies an immigrant-dense working class as a protagonist for progressive social and economic transformation today, matching the clear and compelling framing <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/07/ceos-workers-bernie-sanders-class-conflict\">he uses</a> to talk about issues like economic inequality. Luckily, Sanders&rsquo;s track record suggests he can avoid the trap the Right wants to set for him on immigration and advance a vision of immigrant rights that expands and strengthens his call for a society for the many, not the few.</p>\n<p>The first thing Bernie and other left politicians must understand is that the Right wants to define the immigration and border debate by the question of &ldquo;open borders.&rdquo; The sudden insistence that any politician left of Attila the Hun answer the question of whether they support open borders or not is a ploy to make any reform to today&rsquo;s brutal immigration status quo seem impossible. Left politicians should refuse to take the bait.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Bernie articulated his opposition to &ldquo;open borders&rdquo; using language that legitimates false and dangerous right-wing nativist talking points. While he suggests a social-democratic rationale to that opposition (that we can&rsquo;t support a welfare state and high wages if American taxpayers must fund programs for the world&rsquo;s poor and if American workers must compete against poor immigrants), his rhetoric actually echoes a long-standing xenophobic argument that the world&rsquo;s huddled masses will swamp our economy the moment we blink on border vigilance.</p>\n<p>That contradictory argument, that migrants pose a simultaneous fiscal and labor market threat (too lazy to work so they&rsquo;ll mooch off welfare, yet so good at working for so little that they&rsquo;ll bid wages down), has long been a key nativist-right argument. It draws on a form of balanced-budget xenophobia that was central to the new nativist movement&rsquo;s breakout in 1990s California, as well as that era&rsquo;s broader, racist demonization of welfare.</p>\n<p>Bernie supports working-class unity and a robust welfare state. He should avoid language that suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, by suggesting that immigration exclusion functions to control immigration for the native-born working class&rsquo;s benefit, Bernie mischaracterizes the political economy of migration. For example, immigration flows from Mexico, which have for decades defined American immigration politics, have never been primarily shaped by any purported lack of border enforcement, but rather by <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/11/central-america-migrant-caravan-trump\">political-economic realities</a> in both countries.</p>\n<p>The long wave of Mexican undocumented immigration that took off in the 1970s came to a halt in 2008. Why? As the Congressional Research Service <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R42138.pdf\">put it</a>, &ldquo;Disentangling the effects of enforcement from other factors influencing migration flows is particularly difficult,&rdquo; because a sharp increase in border militarization measures &ldquo;all have occurred at the same time as the most severe recession since the 1930s.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But sociologist Douglas Massey and his colleagues have <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5049707/\">found</a> that border militarization <em>did</em> cause a perverse &ldquo;caging effect,&rdquo; which persuaded migrants who otherwise would have stayed a short time in the United States before returning to Mexico to actually stay put in the US &mdash; thus increasing the undocumented population.</p>\n<p>In other words, border enforcement has likely functioned more as a <em>cause</em> of undocumented immigration than a deterrent against it.</p>\n<p>In 2015, Bernie deservedly caught flack for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/7/28/9014491/bernie-sanders-vox-conversation\">calling</a> open borders a &ldquo;Koch brothers proposal.&rdquo; In reality, throughout the history of American capitalism, capital has never favored &ldquo;open borders.&rdquo; Business has always pushed for forms of migration that combined exclusion and oppression to create a labor caste system designed to increase profits by weakening immigrant-worker power &mdash; and thus the power of the working class as a whole.</p>\n<p>Black Africans were coercively migrated as enslaved laborers; roughly 250,000 Chinese migrant laborers came to work in the West until the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. In the early twentieth century, recruiters enticed Mexican workers into a system akin to indentured servitude in the United States known as <em>el enganche</em>, &ldquo;the hook,&rdquo; exploiting Mexicans&rsquo; labor as part of a system that also subjected Mexicans to segregation, discrimination, and rampant state and vigilante violence; millions more Mexican workers were recruited to work in the brutally exploitative Bracero guest-worker program after the door was shut to more Asians and to Eastern and Southern Europeans in the early twentieth century. In the 1960s, after the Bracero program was shuttered, Mexicans, documented and not, continued to labor in the US, their racialized second-class caste status exploited for profit.</p>\n<p>For capitalists, the border can&rsquo;t be open, but must function as a sieve that sorts workers into more or less favored categories in a segmented labor market to more effectively exploit them all &mdash; while simultaneously creating a useful scapegoat for the misery that capital imposes.</p>\n<p>NAFTA, for example, was accompanied by a massive crackdown on &ldquo;illegal immigration.&rdquo; Rahm Emanuel <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/230512565/Nov-1996-Emanuel-Memo-to-Clinton\">put it clearly</a> to President Bill Clinton in a 1996 memo: the US had to crack down on &ldquo;illegal immigrants&rdquo; to quiet opposition to free trade. &ldquo;We should be honest, that if we want continued public support for trade and friendly relations with Mexico, we must be vigilant in our effort to curb illegal trade (e.g. narcotics and immigrants).&rdquo; The hardening of borders for people and opening of borders for capital is functional and by design.</p>\n<p>There are no doubt libertarian calls for &ldquo;open borders&rdquo; emanating from the Cato Institute. But empirically, capital and the politicians who represent its power in Washington have consistently built racist immigration systems that divide the working class.</p>\n<p>By contrast, immigrant workers have been at the forefront of labor struggles: Haymarket in 1886; the 1912 Bread and Roses textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts; <a href=\"http://phr.ucpress.edu/content/85/2/188\">cross-border unity</a> between the Industrial Workers of the World and Mexican revolutionary <em>Magonistas</em>; the Congress of Industrial Organizations&rsquo; (CIO) organization of millions of Southern and Eastern European immigrant and black workers into a militant, striking fighting force; Los Angeles&rsquo; <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-central-american-migrants-helped-revive-the-us-labor-movement-109398\">Justice for Janitors</a> campaign in 1990; the mass immigrant rights protests on May Day 2006 that transformed American immigration politics forever, and the Fight for $15 waged in significant part by immigrant service workers. Similarly, from the Haymarket trials and the First Red Scare to the Republican Revolution of 1994, the Tea Party, and now Trumpism, the Right&rsquo;s anti-immigrant attacks have gone hand in hand with attacks on the entire working class.</p>\n<p>Organized labor&rsquo;s history on immigration is no doubt complex and rife with conflict. But CIO leader James B. Carey <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2706973\">described</a> the true nature of the class struggle well in 1940: &lsquo;&lsquo;The propagandists who preach today that [immigrants] aggravate our unemployment problem &hellip; are the very persons who never intended and who do not now intend to do anything about our own, American unemployment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Bernie must conceive of immigrant rights as workers&rsquo; rights, breaking with a dominant liberal moralism that appeals to sympathy with immigrant victims instead of calling for solidarity with immigrant workers. The standard liberal framework that the American economy &ldquo;needs immigrant workers to do jobs that no one else wants to do&rdquo; feeds directly into Bannonite anti-migrant nationalism. The Left&rsquo;s message isn&rsquo;t that capitalists need more immigrant workers but that the labor movement needs more immigrant worker militants.</p>\n<p>Laudably, Bernie has started to connect the dots, <a href=\"https://www.latintimes.com/bernie-sanders-immigration-plan-20-reasons-why-senator-more-pro-immigrant-hillary-355663\">supporting visas</a> for worker whistleblowers who call out labor abuses. But he must do more, particularly as Trump seems poised to accelerate <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/texas-immigration-raid.html\">mass raids</a> on immigrants in their workplace ahead of the 2020 election.</p>\n<p>Last night, Bernie&rsquo;s generally masterful performance at a Fox News town hall included discussion of the border and immigration. His rhetoric was mixed.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, he rightly emphasized the dire conditions of &ldquo;violence and misery&rdquo; that Central Americans migrants flee and warned that a failure to confront climate change would force massive numbers of people from their homes. But his proposed solutions were vague, and he returned to his standard call for &ldquo;comprehensive immigration reform,&rdquo; a phrase that either means nothing or, worse, refers to the legislative framework combining legalization, enforcement, and guestworker programs that repeatedly failed to become law under Bush and Obama. CIR is not only a morally odious tradeoff but one that is premised on winning over Republicans who will never vote for legalization &mdash; ever.</p>\n<p>And Sanders also argued that there were more &ldquo;cost-effective&rdquo; solutions than the wall, saying: &ldquo;We need border security, of course we do &mdash; who argues with that?&rdquo; Well, me and a lot of immigrant rights activists. I wrote an op-ed recently literally called &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/opinion/democrats-border-security-wall.html\">The Case Against Border Security</a>,&rdquo; arguing that Democrats must stop describing immigration as a &ldquo;security&rdquo; issue because it reaffirms a right-wing nativist framework for interpreting immigration.</p>\n<p>Bernie has to talk about immigration differently on the campaign trail. But we shouldn&rsquo;t confuse his record on this point: Sanders is easily the Democratic primary candidate with the strongest record on immigration.</p>\n<p>First, the imperfect: he <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-supported-minu/\">inexplicably voted</a> for a 2006 bill that allowed for the indefinite detention &ldquo;of specified dangerous aliens&rdquo; awaiting a final ruling on their deportation. The legislation, as the ACLU put it, &ldquo;would broaden&rdquo; a &ldquo;constitutionally dubious practice.&rdquo; And that same year, he voted to block the US government from sharing intelligence on Minutemen vigilantes with Mexico. Neither of these votes &mdash; the former, legislation that died in the Senate, and the latter purely if toxically symbolic &mdash; has been satisfactorily explained. Bernie should say that both votes were a mistake.</p>\n<p>Far more importantly, however, Sanders has mostly voted correctly on the major legislation that has defined immigration politics since he first entered the House.</p>\n<p>He voted against <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/6061/all-actions?overview=closed&q=%7B%22roll-call-vote%22%3A%22all%22%7D\">2006 Secure Fence Act</a> to build hundreds of miles of border wall &mdash; unlike Obama, Clinton, and Biden, when the bill came to the Senate. He <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/06/28/immigration.vote.rollcall/\">voted against</a> a 2007 &ldquo;reform bill&rdquo; that included legalization for undocumented workers but also harsh enforcement and a guest-worker program. It was supported by mainstream immigrant rights groups but opposed by the left grassroots movement. In 2013, however, he voted in favor of similar legislation, falling in line behind mainstream immigrant rights groups and the Obama White House. He voted against the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which greatly expanded government power to detain and deport.</p>\n<p>And perhaps most importantly of all, he was one of just eighty-seven House members to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; on the catastrophic Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which firmly linked the deportation machinery to the system of mass incarceration.</p>\n<p>Bernie is also the only candidate with an economic and foreign policy agenda consonant with substantive support for immigrant rights.</p>\n<p>Beto O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s rhetoric on the border has been stronger &mdash; it&rsquo;s where Beto is from, and he clearly understands the harm caused by militarization, something that I <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/conversations/2016/11/5/13501408/trump-mexico-beto-orourke\">interviewed him about in 2016</a>. And Beto is notable for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/betoorourke/status/832651566045736962?lang=en\">calling border militarization </a>by its name. Juli&aacute;n Castro has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/4/2/18291584/2020-immigration-democrats-policy-castro-abolish-ice\">recently called</a> for the decriminalization of &ldquo;illegal entry,&rdquo; the federal misdemeanor that Trump has used to separate families. I <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/opinion/democrats-border-security-wall.html\">called</a> on left politicians to do just that in February; Castro should be commended for doing just that. Castro has also set a high bar in calling for an end to cooperation agreements between ICE and local law enforcement, the latter of which has become the starting point for the deportation pipeline.</p>\n<p>But border and immigration politics can&rsquo;t be approached as stand-alone issues, apart from a larger political vision: immigrant rights are workers&rsquo; rights, and so support for organized labor is indispensable for evaluating a candidate on immigration.</p>\n<p>Likewise, <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/10/honduras-migrants-caravan-trump\">suppor</a>t for immigrants must be accompanied by an insistence on changing a foreign policy and global political economy that forces people from their homes and violates their right to stay put, which is a fundamental corollary to the freedom of movement. Support for immigrants must also include a bold agenda to combat climate change, which is already <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-climate-change-is-fuelling-the-us-border-crisis\">fomenting mass migration</a> from Central America.</p>\n<p>Bernie is the only candidate who can challenge US empire and the fossil-fueled global financial system that <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/11/immigration-reform-homeland-security-border-trump-obama-clinton/\">produced</a> mass forced migration and hardening borders that are <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/06/trump-immigration-child-family-separation-policy\">at the root</a> of today&rsquo;s migration crisis.</p>\n<p>Bernie doesn&rsquo;t need to come out for &ldquo;open borders.&rdquo; I support open borders and the unfettered transnational free movement of people, but I don&rsquo;t think it should be a litmus test for our support. (I also support worker control of the means of production but don&rsquo;t think that Bernie should call for that &mdash; not yet, anyway.) We <em>should</em> demand that Bernie speak clearly in favor of demilitarizing and making the border <em>more open</em> so as to radically increase the government&rsquo;s respect for the human right to mobility.</p>\n<p>That would include tearing down the hundreds of miles of <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/01/immigration-wall-trump-borges\">border wall</a> that already exists, dramatically downsizing the Border Patrol, and using those savings to address the humanitarian crisis at the border; ensuring that the right to asylum <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/11/we-built-wall-asylum-refugees-immigrants\">is respected</a> for those fleeing not only state repression but also climate chaos and <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/11/central-america-migrants-asylum-ms13-gang-violence\">domestic</a> and gang violence; and decriminalizing immigration enforcement by, for example, repealing laws that make illegal entry a misdemeanor and illegal reentry a felony. Castro&rsquo;s program isn&rsquo;t a bad place to start, as it&rsquo;s strong on these issues.</p>\n<p>The good news is that Bernie is well positioned to do all of this, given his track record of moving the national debate leftward generally and his strong voting record on immigration, breaking from the Democratic establishment to vote against harsh border enforcement and immigrant-criminalization measures during the long era when doing so was politically dangerous.</p>\n<p>The &ldquo;open borders&rdquo; question is often a misleading one, because it presupposes that there are only two options: either zero border controls or today&rsquo;s dystopian reality of border militarization. But Bernie can demand a <em>more open</em> border without demanding &ldquo;open borders&rdquo; now.</p>\n<p>When Bernie is asked about open borders, his response should be something like this: &ldquo;Wrong question. In the last three decades, we have nearly quintupled the size of our Border Patrol and built hundreds of miles of border wall &mdash; a measure, by the way, that I voted against in 2006. In doing so, we have militarized the border beyond recognition, which has caused thousands of migrant deaths in the desert and harmed millions in borderlands communities &mdash; people who have told me that they don&rsquo;t want to live in a police state, and don&rsquo;t want to be cut off from their Mexican sister cities to which they have such deep, long-standing ties. We have Trump today in part because we have had decades of scapegoating undocumented immigrants for the harms caused by an economy and government controlled by the 1 percent for their exclusive benefit.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The crisis at the border today is a humanitarian one, especially impacting <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/11/migrant-caravan-troop-deployment-veteran-statement\">Central American</a>s. We must demilitarize the border and ensure that it is open to asylum seekers fleeing economic devastation and violence &mdash; a situation created by our country&rsquo;s dreadful policies in Central America and, increasingly, the realities of global warming.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mexico is our next-door neighbor. It is immoral and hypocritical to suddenly say that Mexicans, our neighbors, are not welcome here &mdash; especially since US business has long relied on recruiting and exploiting Mexican migrant labor. People say that Mexicans should come legally. Do you know how many years a Mexican relative of US citizen has to wait to do that? Mexicans need legal ways to migrate so they can reunite with their families.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Throughout American history, immigrant workers have been at the forefront of the struggle for all workers&rsquo; rights. I proudly stand with them in that fight.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s 2020 campaign will be laser-focused on pushing virulent and racist anti-immigrant rhetoric. The Democratic nominee cannot hide from that fight. It&rsquo;s urgent that Bernie recruit a left immigrant rights brain trust to formulate a vibrant and coherent strategy that can both take on Trump and surpass the establishment liberal immigrant rights framework that has for decades utterly failed to advance immigrant rights.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t just naive idealism: <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2018/10/04/2018-midterm-voters-issues-and-political-values/\">Americans today hold</a> perhaps the most <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2018/06/28/shifting-public-views-on-legal-immigration-into-the-u-s/\">pro-immigrant opinions</a> in US history, thanks in part to growing partisan polarization on the issue that has accelerated under Trump. It&rsquo;s thus the task of left politicians to not only follow but to lead.</p>\n<p>Sanders&rsquo;s 2020 campaign slogan is &ldquo;not me, us.&rdquo; A robust program and strong rhetoric on immigrant rights is necessary for Bernie to ensure that &ldquo;us&rdquo; refers to the entirety: the task is to stand with immigrants as they fight at the lead of the working class.</p>",

                "text": "Asked why he supported \u201copen borders\u201d at a recent Iowa town hall, Bernie Sanders responded that he did not.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you may be getting your information wrong \u2026 I think what we need is comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d said Sanders. It got worse. \u201cMy god, there\u2019s a lot of poverty in this world, and you\u2019re going to have people from all over the world. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that we can do at this point. Can\u2019t do it.\u201d\nLiberal critics to Bernie\u2019s right cynically frame comments like this one as evidence of his lack of commitment to racial justice. This is absurd: Bernie has a far better record on, and program for, racial justice than members of the Democratic establishment. Bernie does, however, sometimes fail to connect the dots between his marquee economic agenda and his racial justice program. His decrying \u201copen borders\u201d was a case in point: the comment was politically unnecessary, played into a right-wing nativist trap, and misconstrued the political economy of migration.\nBernie\u2019s track record on immigration is strong. But he currently lacks a bold vision for immigrant justice that identifies an immigrant-dense working class as a protagonist for progressive social and economic transformation today, matching the clear and compelling framing he uses to talk about issues like economic inequality. Luckily, Sanders\u2019s track record suggests he can avoid the trap the Right wants to set for him on immigration and advance a vision of immigrant rights that expands and strengthens his call for a society for the many, not the few.\nThe first thing Bernie and other left politicians must understand is that the Right wants to define the immigration and border debate by the question of \u201copen borders.\u201d The sudden insistence that any politician left of Attila the Hun answer the question of whether they support open borders or not is a ploy to make any reform to today\u2019s brutal immigration status quo seem impossible. Left politicians should refuse to take the bait.\nUnfortunately, Bernie articulated his opposition to \u201copen borders\u201d using language that legitimates false and dangerous right-wing nativist talking points. While he suggests a social-democratic rationale to that opposition (that we can\u2019t support a welfare state and high wages if American taxpayers must fund programs for the world\u2019s poor and if American workers must compete against poor immigrants), his rhetoric actually echoes a long-standing xenophobic argument that the world\u2019s huddled masses will swamp our economy the moment we blink on border vigilance.\nThat contradictory argument, that migrants pose a simultaneous fiscal and labor market threat (too lazy to work so they\u2019ll mooch off welfare, yet so good at working for so little that they\u2019ll bid wages down), has long been a key nativist-right argument. It draws on a form of balanced-budget xenophobia that was central to the new nativist movement\u2019s breakout in 1990s California, as well as that era\u2019s broader, racist demonization of welfare.\nBernie supports working-class unity and a robust welfare state. He should avoid language that suggests otherwise.\nWhat\u2019s more, by suggesting that immigration exclusion functions to control immigration for the native-born working class\u2019s benefit, Bernie mischaracterizes the political economy of migration. For example, immigration flows from Mexico, which have for decades defined American immigration politics, have never been primarily shaped by any purported lack of border enforcement, but rather by political-economic realities in both countries.\nThe long wave of Mexican undocumented immigration that took off in the 1970s came to a halt in 2008. Why? As the Congressional Research Service put it, \u201cDisentangling the effects of enforcement from other factors influencing migration flows is particularly difficult,\u201d because a sharp increase in border militarization measures \u201call have occurred at the same time as the most severe recession since the 1930s.\u201d\nBut sociologist Douglas Massey and his colleagues have found that border militarization did cause a perverse \u201ccaging effect,\u201d which persuaded migrants who otherwise would have stayed a short time in the United States before returning to Mexico to actually stay put in the US \u2014 thus increasing the undocumented population.\nIn other words, border enforcement has likely functioned more as a cause of undocumented immigration than a deterrent against it.\nIn 2015, Bernie deservedly caught flack for calling open borders a \u201cKoch brothers proposal.\u201d In reality, throughout the history of American capitalism, capital has never favored \u201copen borders.\u201d Business has always pushed for forms of migration that combined exclusion and oppression to create a labor caste system designed to increase profits by weakening immigrant-worker power \u2014 and thus the power of the working class as a whole.\nBlack Africans were coercively migrated as enslaved laborers; roughly 250,000 Chinese migrant laborers came to work in the West until the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. In the early twentieth century, recruiters enticed Mexican workers into a system akin to indentured servitude in the United States known as el enganche, \u201cthe hook,\u201d exploiting Mexicans\u2019 labor as part of a system that also subjected Mexicans to segregation, discrimination, and rampant state and vigilante violence; millions more Mexican workers were recruited to work in the brutally exploitative Bracero guest-worker program after the door was shut to more Asians and to Eastern and Southern Europeans in the early twentieth century. In the 1960s, after the Bracero program was shuttered, Mexicans, documented and not, continued to labor in the US, their racialized second-class caste status exploited for profit.\nFor capitalists, the border can\u2019t be open, but must function as a sieve that sorts workers into more or less favored categories in a segmented labor market to more effectively exploit them all \u2014 while simultaneously creating a useful scapegoat for the misery that capital imposes.\nNAFTA, for example, was accompanied by a massive crackdown on \u201cillegal immigration.\u201d Rahm Emanuel put it clearly to President Bill Clinton in a 1996 memo: the US had to crack down on \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d to quiet opposition to free trade. \u201cWe should be honest, that if we want continued public support for trade and friendly relations with Mexico, we must be vigilant in our effort to curb illegal trade (e.g. narcotics and immigrants).\u201d The hardening of borders for people and opening of borders for capital is functional and by design.\nThere are no doubt libertarian calls for \u201copen borders\u201d emanating from the Cato Institute. But empirically, capital and the politicians who represent its power in Washington have consistently built racist immigration systems that divide the working class.\nBy contrast, immigrant workers have been at the forefront of labor struggles: Haymarket in 1886; the 1912 Bread and Roses textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts; cross-border unity between the Industrial Workers of the World and Mexican revolutionary Magonistas; the Congress of Industrial Organizations\u2019 (CIO) organization of millions of Southern and Eastern European immigrant and black workers into a militant, striking fighting force; Los Angeles\u2019 Justice for Janitors campaign in 1990; the mass immigrant rights protests on May Day 2006 that transformed American immigration politics forever, and the Fight for $15 waged in significant part by immigrant service workers. Similarly, from the Haymarket trials and the First Red Scare to the Republican Revolution of 1994, the Tea Party, and now Trumpism, the Right\u2019s anti-immigrant attacks have gone hand in hand with attacks on the entire working class.\nOrganized labor\u2019s history on immigration is no doubt complex and rife with conflict. But CIO leader James B. Carey described the true nature of the class struggle well in 1940: \u2018\u2018The propagandists who preach today that [immigrants] aggravate our unemployment problem \u2026 are the very persons who never intended and who do not now intend to do anything about our own, American unemployment.\u201d\nBernie must conceive of immigrant rights as workers\u2019 rights, breaking with a dominant liberal moralism that appeals to sympathy with immigrant victims instead of calling for solidarity with immigrant workers. The standard liberal framework that the American economy \u201cneeds immigrant workers to do jobs that no one else wants to do\u201d feeds directly into Bannonite anti-migrant nationalism. The Left\u2019s message isn\u2019t that capitalists need more immigrant workers but that the labor movement needs more immigrant worker militants.\nLaudably, Bernie has started to connect the dots, supporting visas for worker whistleblowers who call out labor abuses. But he must do more, particularly as Trump seems poised to accelerate mass raids on immigrants in their workplace ahead of the 2020 election.\nLast night, Bernie\u2019s generally masterful performance at a Fox News town hall included discussion of the border and immigration. His rhetoric was mixed.\nOn the one hand, he rightly emphasized the dire conditions of \u201cviolence and misery\u201d that Central Americans migrants flee and warned that a failure to confront climate change would force massive numbers of people from their homes. But his proposed solutions were vague, and he returned to his standard call for \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform,\u201d a phrase that either means nothing or, worse, refers to the legislative framework combining legalization, enforcement, and guestworker programs that repeatedly failed to become law under Bush and Obama. CIR is not only a morally odious tradeoff but one that is premised on winning over Republicans who will never vote for legalization \u2014 ever.\nAnd Sanders also argued that there were more \u201ccost-effective\u201d solutions than the wall, saying: \u201cWe need border security, of course we do \u2014 who argues with that?\u201d Well, me and a lot of immigrant rights activists. I wrote an op-ed recently literally called \u201cThe Case Against Border Security,\u201d arguing that Democrats must stop describing immigration as a \u201csecurity\u201d issue because it reaffirms a right-wing nativist framework for interpreting immigration.\nBernie has to talk about immigration differently on the campaign trail. But we shouldn\u2019t confuse his record on this point: Sanders is easily the Democratic primary candidate with the strongest record on immigration.\nFirst, the imperfect: he inexplicably voted for a 2006 bill that allowed for the indefinite detention \u201cof specified dangerous aliens\u201d awaiting a final ruling on their deportation. The legislation, as the ACLU put it, \u201cwould broaden\u201d a \u201cconstitutionally dubious practice.\u201d And that same year, he voted to block the US government from sharing intelligence on Minutemen vigilantes with Mexico. Neither of these votes \u2014 the former, legislation that died in the Senate, and the latter purely if toxically symbolic \u2014 has been satisfactorily explained. Bernie should say that both votes were a mistake.\nFar more importantly, however, Sanders has mostly voted correctly on the major legislation that has defined immigration politics since he first entered the House.\nHe voted against 2006 Secure Fence Act to build hundreds of miles of border wall \u2014 unlike Obama, Clinton, and Biden, when the bill came to the Senate. He voted against a 2007 \u201creform bill\u201d that included legalization for undocumented workers but also harsh enforcement and a guest-worker program. It was supported by mainstream immigrant rights groups but opposed by the left grassroots movement. In 2013, however, he voted in favor of similar legislation, falling in line behind mainstream immigrant rights groups and the Obama White House. He voted against the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which greatly expanded government power to detain and deport.\nAnd perhaps most importantly of all, he was one of just eighty-seven House members to vote \u201cno\u201d on the catastrophic Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which firmly linked the deportation machinery to the system of mass incarceration.\nBernie is also the only candidate with an economic and foreign policy agenda consonant with substantive support for immigrant rights.\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rhetoric on the border has been stronger \u2014 it\u2019s where Beto is from, and he clearly understands the harm caused by militarization, something that I interviewed him about in 2016. And Beto is notable for calling border militarization by its name. Juli\u00e1n Castro has recently called for the decriminalization of \u201cillegal entry,\u201d the federal misdemeanor that Trump has used to separate families. I called on left politicians to do just that in February; Castro should be commended for doing just that. Castro has also set a high bar in calling for an end to cooperation agreements between ICE and local law enforcement, the latter of which has become the starting point for the deportation pipeline.\nBut border and immigration politics can\u2019t be approached as stand-alone issues, apart from a larger political vision: immigrant rights are workers\u2019 rights, and so support for organized labor is indispensable for evaluating a candidate on immigration.\nLikewise, support for immigrants must be accompanied by an insistence on changing a foreign policy and global political economy that forces people from their homes and violates their right to stay put, which is a fundamental corollary to the freedom of movement. Support for immigrants must also include a bold agenda to combat climate change, which is already fomenting mass migration from Central America.\nBernie is the only candidate who can challenge US empire and the fossil-fueled global financial system that produced mass forced migration and hardening borders that are at the root of today\u2019s migration crisis.\nBernie doesn\u2019t need to come out for \u201copen borders.\u201d I support open borders and the unfettered transnational free movement of people, but I don\u2019t think it should be a litmus test for our support. (I also support worker control of the means of production but don\u2019t think that Bernie should call for that \u2014 not yet, anyway.) We should demand that Bernie speak clearly in favor of demilitarizing and making the border more open so as to radically increase the government\u2019s respect for the human right to mobility.\nThat would include tearing down the hundreds of miles of border wall that already exists, dramatically downsizing the Border Patrol, and using those savings to address the humanitarian crisis at the border; ensuring that the right to asylum is respected for those fleeing not only state repression but also climate chaos and domestic and gang violence; and decriminalizing immigration enforcement by, for example, repealing laws that make illegal entry a misdemeanor and illegal reentry a felony. Castro\u2019s program isn\u2019t a bad place to start, as it\u2019s strong on these issues.\nThe good news is that Bernie is well positioned to do all of this, given his track record of moving the national debate leftward generally and his strong voting record on immigration, breaking from the Democratic establishment to vote against harsh border enforcement and immigrant-criminalization measures during the long era when doing so was politically dangerous.\nThe \u201copen borders\u201d question is often a misleading one, because it presupposes that there are only two options: either zero border controls or today\u2019s dystopian reality of border militarization. But Bernie can demand a more open border without demanding \u201copen borders\u201d now.\nWhen Bernie is asked about open borders, his response should be something like this: \u201cWrong question. In the last three decades, we have nearly quintupled the size of our Border Patrol and built hundreds of miles of border wall \u2014 a measure, by the way, that I voted against in 2006. In doing so, we have militarized the border beyond recognition, which has caused thousands of migrant deaths in the desert and harmed millions in borderlands communities \u2014 people who have told me that they don\u2019t want to live in a police state, and don\u2019t want to be cut off from their Mexican sister cities to which they have such deep, long-standing ties. We have Trump today in part because we have had decades of scapegoating undocumented immigrants for the harms caused by an economy and government controlled by the 1 percent for their exclusive benefit.\n\u201cThe crisis at the border today is a humanitarian one, especially impacting Central Americans. We must demilitarize the border and ensure that it is open to asylum seekers fleeing economic devastation and violence \u2014 a situation created by our country\u2019s dreadful policies in Central America and, increasingly, the realities of global warming.\n\u201cMexico is our next-door neighbor. It is immoral and hypocritical to suddenly say that Mexicans, our neighbors, are not welcome here \u2014 especially since US business has long relied on recruiting and exploiting Mexican migrant labor. People say that Mexicans should come legally. Do you know how many years a Mexican relative of US citizen has to wait to do that? Mexicans need legal ways to migrate so they can reunite with their families.\n\u201cThroughout American history, immigrant workers have been at the forefront of the struggle for all workers\u2019 rights. I proudly stand with them in that fight.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s 2020 campaign will be laser-focused on pushing virulent and racist anti-immigrant rhetoric. The Democratic nominee cannot hide from that fight. It\u2019s urgent that Bernie recruit a left immigrant rights brain trust to formulate a vibrant and coherent strategy that can both take on Trump and surpass the establishment liberal immigrant rights framework that has for decades utterly failed to advance immigrant rights.\nThis isn\u2019t just naive idealism: Americans today hold perhaps the most pro-immigrant opinions in US history, thanks in part to growing partisan polarization on the issue that has accelerated under Trump. It\u2019s thus the task of left politicians to not only follow but to lead.\nSanders\u2019s 2020 campaign slogan is \u201cnot me, us.\u201d A robust program and strong rhetoric on immigrant rights is necessary for Bernie to ensure that \u201cus\u201d refers to the entirety: the task is to stand with immigrants as they fight at the lead of the working class.",

Matthew Lewis / Getty</p> </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Leavers on the Right insist that <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/04/theresa-euve-done-it-again\">Brexit</a> represents a new dawn, a break from the old politics and a fresh start for Britain. On Monday, however, a candidate for UKIP, Nigel Farage&rsquo;s old political stomping ground, was <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/sargon-akkad-discord-ukip-mep-campaign\">revealed</a> to have used a Discord server to drum up support for his EU election campaign, and predictably it was awash with hate.</p>\n<p>The UKIP candidate, Youtuber Carl Benjamin &mdash; or &ldquo;Sargon of Akkad&rdquo; &mdash; invited fans to join his server, titled #sargon-MEP-help-offers, to help him get elected. Comments <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/sargon-akkad-discord-ukip-mep-campaign?ref=hpsplash\">uncovered by <em>Buzzfeed</em> were openly fascist:</a> &ldquo;Maybe start assassinating fucking Eurocrats, preferably the unelected ones on top. But alas. That would be murder. And be wrong. Totally.&rdquo; Another user commented: &ldquo;We should strip them of their humanity first. If they&rsquo;re not recognized as humans, it&rsquo;s not murder,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;First step is forcing them to wear some kind of branding on their clothes.&rdquo; Another asked: &ldquo;So we decapitate the parliament members?&rdquo; With a member responding: &ldquo;Send messages. Hang em on street-lights.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The comments throughout the Discord were avowedly racist and hate-filled &mdash; no surprise from a deliberately controversial candidate who is proudly &ldquo;anti-feminist&rdquo; (read, misogynist), and par for the course for much of the Euroskeptic right, which is given so much credulous airtime by the mainstream media.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Nigel Farage himself, persistent as political sewage, refuses to be be flushed away. Another day, another paparazzi-pandering press launch for his new endeavor: the Brexit Party, its logo a blue arrow, vaguely reminiscent of Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s from 2016. The new party claimed to have raised over &pound;750,000 in a few days, online and at several rallies, organically and in small denominations. Quickly, the party made a considerable dent in EU election polls, heavily outperforming the <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/02/independent-group-labor-social-democratic-party\">disastrous</a> Independent Group / Change UK (or CHUK &mdash; <em>very coincidentally</em> similar to Chuka Umunna&rsquo;s name, in a nod to <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/07/emmanuel-macron-france-unions-workers-economics-le-pen\">Emmanuel Macron&rsquo;s</a> <em>En Marche</em> nomenclature), sucking votes away from the Conservatives and leaving Labour free to sneak an unforeseen landslide.</p>\n<p>But for all the glitz and pomp, there is little new in either Farage&rsquo;s new launch, or that of his former political vehicle, UKIP. Farage has always tried to position himself as mainstream, with a cloying man-of-the-people act capitalizing on the fact he didn&rsquo;t go to university, while breezily omitting the fact that he attended the highly exclusive and expensive fee-paying Dulwich College, and made a mint as a city trader in London&rsquo;s banking sector. Hoisting a pint of soapy ale aloft in photos is a handy substitute for any real working-class credentials if there&rsquo;s a camera nearby.</p>\n<p>Both UKIP and the new Brexit Party have attempted to cast themselves as mainstream and representative of a British public that is underserved by the current parliament, which consists predominantly of politicians who backed (and still back) remaining in the European Union.

                "text": "Leavers on the Right insist that Brexit represents a new dawn, a break from the old politics and a fresh start for Britain. On Monday, however, a candidate for UKIP, Nigel Farage\u2019s old political stomping ground, was revealed to have used a Discord server to drum up support for his EU election campaign, and predictably it was awash with hate.\nThe UKIP candidate, Youtuber Carl Benjamin \u2014 or \u201cSargon of Akkad\u201d \u2014 invited fans to join his server, titled #sargon-MEP-help-offers, to help him get elected. Comments uncovered by Buzzfeed were openly fascist: \u201cMaybe start assassinating fucking Eurocrats, preferably the unelected ones on top. But alas. That would be murder. And be wrong. Totally.\u201d Another user commented: \u201cWe should strip them of their humanity first. If they\u2019re not recognized as humans, it\u2019s not murder,\u201d adding, \u201cFirst step is forcing them to wear some kind of branding on their clothes.\u201d Another asked: \u201cSo we decapitate the parliament members?\u201d With a member responding: \u201cSend messages. Hang em on street-lights.\u201d\nThe comments throughout the Discord were avowedly racist and hate-filled \u2014 no surprise from a deliberately controversial candidate who is proudly \u201canti-feminist\u201d (read, misogynist), and par for the course for much of the Euroskeptic right, which is given so much credulous airtime by the mainstream media.\nMeanwhile, Nigel Farage himself, persistent as political sewage, refuses to be be flushed away. Another day, another paparazzi-pandering press launch for his new endeavor: the Brexit Party, its logo a blue arrow, vaguely reminiscent of Hillary Clinton\u2019s from 2016. The new party claimed to have raised over \u00a3750,000 in a few days, online and at several rallies, organically and in small denominations. Quickly, the party made a considerable dent in EU election polls, heavily outperforming the disastrous Independent Group / Change UK (or CHUK \u2014 very coincidentally similar to Chuka Umunna\u2019s name, in a nod to Emmanuel Macron\u2019s En Marche nomenclature), sucking votes away from the Conservatives and leaving Labour free to sneak an unforeseen landslide.\nBut for all the glitz and pomp, there is little new in either Farage\u2019s new launch, or that of his former political vehicle, UKIP. Farage has always tried to position himself as mainstream, with a cloying man-of-the-people act capitalizing on the fact he didn\u2019t go to university, while breezily omitting the fact that he attended the highly exclusive and expensive fee-paying Dulwich College, and made a mint as a city trader in London\u2019s banking sector. Hoisting a pint of soapy ale aloft in photos is a handy substitute for any real working-class credentials if there\u2019s a camera nearby.\nBoth UKIP and the new Brexit Party have attempted to cast themselves as mainstream and representative of a British public that is underserved by the current parliament, which consists predominantly of politicians who backed (and still back) remaining in the European Union. The handful of MPs who voted Leave are, by and large, right-wing headbangers and extremists, marking Brexit, as it stands, as a project of the far right.\nThat is no more obvious than when examining the language employed by UKIP, Farage, and his new Brexit Party. On the night of the EU referendum, I remember being chilled to the bone when at 4 AM, live on the BBC, Farage delivered a victory speech rejoicing that Leave had won \u201cwithout a single bullet being fired\u201d \u2014 just seven days after the murder of Jo Cox. The Labour MP had been assassinated outside her constituency advice surgery, shot with a sawed-off shotgun and stabbed twice, while her killer shouted \u201cPut Britain first!\u201d \u201ckeep Britain independent!\u201d and \u201cthis is for Britain!\u201d\nThe political atmosphere around the referendum was toxic; heightened xenophobia left many citizens in fear, and subject to racist verbal and physical attacks. In January, on Farage\u2019s radio show, a caller warned that if Brexit was foiled and Britain remained in the EU \u201c\u2026 we are only left with the old-fashioned way of solving disputes and that is blood and slaughter.\u201d Farage responded: \u201cI share your concerns, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why I, if Brexit is completely foiled by these people, we have to make sure there are democratic organizations and parties that they can go and support.\u201d\nAt the launch of his new party, Farage claimed UKIP had been taken over by the far right, adding, \u201cWe can again start to put the fear of God into our members of parliament in Westminster. They deserve nothing less than that after the way they\u2019ve treated us over this betrayal \u2026 I said that if I ever did come back into the political fray, next time it would be no more Mr Nice Guy, and I mean it.\u201d The language of betrayal and threats is a familiar tactic of extremist leaders, including Trump, who incite followers to attack enemies while claiming innocence when queried about their incendiary comments.\nFarage\u2019s Brexit Party was recently forced to suspend two founding members for sharing racist and inflammatory tweets. And on Sunday, even before Benjamin\u2019s racist Discord was uncovered, UKIP was challenged for choosing a candidate with a history of anti-feminist and misogynist tweets and videos. Benjamin had tweeted to Labour MP Jess Philips, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even rape you,\u201d after the MP spoke of receiving rape and death threats as a result of her job. Asked about that specific tweet on the BBC, UKIP leader Gerald Batten described it as \u201csatire\u201d and refused to condemn the party\u2019s decision to pick Benjamin. Several alt-right figures expressed interest in joining the party, aping the bleeding of the US alt-right into mainstream Republican politics.\nBenjamin\u2019s candidacy shows a deliberate decision to adopt the most extreme position possible in the upcoming elections, and a desire to attract open and closet misogynists to the ballot box with no fear of offending or alienating women. For all the mainstream media\u2019s pearl-clutching over the supposed rise of the extremist left, represented by the mild democratic socialism of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, very little weight is afforded to fears that the far right are merrily infiltrating major political parties.\nAn MP has already been murdered by the far right in Britain, Corbyn and another Labour MP were targeted for assassination, and yet parties harboring extremists and stoking up hate speech are routinely invited onto broadcast media. Their racism and misogyny are always sanitized, described not as straightforward bigotry and hate with dangerous repercussions for women and minorities, but the \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d of a supposedly silenced and uniformly white and male working class.\nThe Conservatives look set to take blows at the ballot box if the UK ends up taking part in next month\u2019s European elections. But the platform this gives the far right should concern everyone on the Left.",

Alex Wong / Getty</p> </figcaption></figure>\n<p>In front of a crowd of thousands at the AIPAC Policy Conference on March 26 in Washington DC, one speaker after another took turns condemning progressive Democrats. If there was a theme to the day&rsquo;s programming, it was to use the Left, and in particular the embattled freshman <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/04/ilhan-omar-democratic-party-islamophobia-incitement\">Rep. Ilhan Omar</a>, as a boogeyman and a punching bag.</p>\n<p>Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, <a href=\"http://www.policyconference.org/article/transcripts/2019/mcconnell.asp\">intoned</a> about the &ldquo;growing tide of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment&rdquo; in the Democratic Party. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi <a href=\"http://www.policyconference.org/article/transcripts/2019/pelosi.asp\">bragged</a> about using the allegations of antisemitism against Omar to justify a House bill against the &ldquo;antisemitic myth of dual loyalty.&rdquo; Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on a fuzzy livestream from Israel, directly <a href=\"http://www.policyconference.org/article/transcripts/2019/netanyahu.asp\">called</a> Omar an antisemite.</p>\n<p>That same day, about a ten-minute walk from AIPAC&rsquo;s festivities, the pro-Israel lobby held another, smaller event &mdash; &ldquo;an invitation-only roundtable with Michael Herzog, retired Israeli Defense forces brigadier general&rdquo; &mdash; at the H Street offices of the Center for American Progress (CAP), the most influential Democratic Party&ndash;aligned think tank. According to a private event invitation obtained by <em>Jewish Currents</em>, Herzog planned to discuss &ldquo;the challenges and opportunities that Israel faces in the current strategic landscape.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/16135233/CAP-letter-modified.png\"></img></figure>\n<p>As far as AIPAC-friendly issue experts go, Herzog is fairly tame. Not particularly far to the right, most of his <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/trump-departs-syria-an-israeli-perspective\">public writing</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/israels-2007-strike-on-syrian-nuclear-reactor-lessons-learned-for-iran\">expresses</a> either a quiet concern about the threat Iran poses to Israel and other American allies in the region, or offers <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/neutralizing-the-gaza-powder-keg\">vanilla</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/cracking-the-israeli-palestinian-security-challenge-is-possible\">policy prescriptions</a> to maintain the status quo of Israeli military control over Gaza and the West Bank. Previously a chief of staff in the Israeli Ministry of Defense who worked in negotiations with Palestinians, he presently serves as a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, an influential policy shop reportedly <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/does-pbs-know-that-washin_b_533808\">founded</a> by AIPAC officials.</p>\n<p>But the Herzog event reflects CAP&rsquo;s ambivalence about pursuing a progressive foreign policy and its repeated willingness to partner with reactionary foreign governments, including Israel, India, and the Persian Gulf monarchies.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As a research institution, CAP regularly holds both private and public discussions on a variety of topics &mdash; including America&rsquo;s approaches to foreign policy,&rdquo; a CAP spokesperson told <em>Jewish Currents</em> over email, noting that the group <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/press/advisory/2019/01/29/465626/event-advisory-reclaiming-religious-freedom-conversation-rep-ilhan-omar/\">hosted</a> Ilhan Omar in February and that the AIPAC-Herzog event &ldquo;was just one in a series we have hosted on Middle East policy, including a recent public event on the Trump administration&rsquo;s approach to Palestine.&rdquo; A representative for AIPAC did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>CAP was conceived in the early 2000s by former Clinton administration officials as the Democratic Party&rsquo;s answer to explicitly right-wing think tanks like the Cato Institute, the American Enterprise Institute, and the Heritage Foundation. CAP&rsquo;s sister organization, the CAP Action Fund, with which it shares staff, is a 501(c)4 advocacy group that engages in more explicit lobbying work and houses the <em>ThinkProgress</em> blog and newsroom, which ostensibly operate independently of CAP. Taken as a unit, CAP and its Action Fund comprise the largest institution of liberal policy thought inside the Beltway, and its alumni can be found all across Democratic offices on Capitol Hill and in the ranks of Democratic 2020 presidential campaigns.</p>\n<p>Though much of CAP&rsquo;s funding has come from philanthropic sources with conventionally liberal profiles &mdash; for example, George Soros, the Sandler Foundation, and the Ford Foundation &mdash; the institution has long faced criticism from the Left over its <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/secret-donors-behind-center-american-progress-and-other-think-tanks-updated-524/\">corporate funding sources</a> and the close proximity of its leadership to the Democratic establishment. CAP&rsquo;s chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/us/politics/tanden-sanders-.html\">Neera Tanden</a>, and its board chairman, John Podesta &mdash; both Clinton administration alumni &mdash; were senior advisers to Hillary Clinton throughout her failed 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>And on issues related to the Middle East, CAP has worked hand-in-hand with right-wingers and representatives of illiberal governments, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In recent years, such governments have increasingly relied on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/foreign-powers-buy-influence-at-think-tanks.html\">funding</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-saudis-washington-influence-machine-how-the-kingdom-gained-power-through-fierce-lobbying-and-charm-offensives/2018/10/21/8a0a3320-d3c3-11e8-a275-81c671a50422_story.html\">think tanks</a> like CAP as part of their lobbying efforts in Washington.</p>\n<p>Brian Katulis, the CAP senior fellow responsible for the Herzog-AIPAC event, is a case in point. In 2017, Katulis worked with Ilan Goldenberg, a fellow at another national security think tank influential in Democratic circles, the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), to organize a trip to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the details of which were revealed in <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/07/30/uae-yousef-otaiba-cnas-american-progress-michele-flournoy-drone/\">a 2017 report</a> by <em>The Intercept</em>. According to leaked emails obtained by <em>The Intercept</em>, the trip cost around $150,000 and was paid for by the UAE government.</p>\n<p>The participants &mdash; who included CNAS chief executive and former Hillary Clinton defense secretary prospect Michele Flournoy and fellows from CAP and the center-right American Enterprise Institute &mdash; were set to meet with Abu Dhabi&rsquo;s crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a staunch ally of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman. The UAE government routinely imprisons dissidents, supports the horrific Saudi war in Yemen, and operates a brutal migrant labor system in which, according <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/united-arab-emirates\">to Human Rights Watch</a>, workers &ldquo;who leave their employers can face punishment for &lsquo;absconding,&rsquo; including fines, prison, and deportation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The leaked CAP emails indicate that the think tank junket was a success. Writing to a lobbyist at the Harbour Group, the Washington firm employed by the UAE that pitched the trip, Katulis said that the UAE hosts &ldquo;hit all the key points and having a diversity of meetings was a good thing, and it was great to see the top leadership.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/01/16/center-for-american-progress-cap-uae-leak/\">firing two staffers</a> suspected of leaking the emails to <em>The Intercept</em>, CAP said in late January that it would no longer take funding from antidemocratic governments. While the UAE &ldquo;funding never impacted any CAP position or policy,&rdquo; a spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/25/united-arab-emirates-funding-center-for-american-progress\">told the <em>Guardian</em></a>, &ldquo;everybody here agrees it&rsquo;s just the right thing to do.&rdquo; Before cutting ties, CAP admitted to having taken between $500,000 and $1 million from the UAE government.</p>\n<p>When it comes to progressive criticism of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, CAP has shown a similar willingness to buckle to outside pressure. Though CAP maintains that <em>ThinkProgress</em> operates with editorial independence, former staffers have repeatedly insisted that they were instructed to avoid criticizing the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>A former editor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benjaminja/status/1117543572838940673\">claimed</a> in a Twitter thread on Sunday that in late 2011 and early 2012, CAP senior leadership barred <em>ThinkProgress</em> staffers from mentioning Netanyahu. The alleged censorship was a direct response to a right-wing campaign <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/revealed-the-secret-coordinated-effort-to-smear-thinkprogress-as-anti-semitic-and-anti-israel-359e671e297b/\">organized</a> by a former senior AIPAC official to paint <em>ThinkProgress</em>&rsquo;s reporting and commentary as antisemitic. Further emails <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/11/05/leaked-emails-from-pro-clinton-group-reveal-censorship-of-staff-on-israel-aipac-pandering-warped-militarism/\">leaked</a> to <em>The Intercept</em> show that Israel lobby activists (including Hillary Clinton loyalist Ann Lewis) successfully pressured Tanden to urge her staffers to back off Israel coverage.</p>\n<p>Over this past weekend, criticism of CAP&rsquo;s closeness to establishment Democratic politics, an undercurrent of the 2016 Democratic primary fight between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, once again <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/us/politics/bernie-sanders-2020-candidates.html\">spilled out</a> into public view. Sanders&rsquo;s current presidential campaign <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5839898-Bernie-Sanders-Letter-Accusing-CAP-of.html\">released</a> a letter accusing <em>ThinkProgress</em> of &ldquo;counterproductive negative campaigning&rdquo; against Sanders and other Democratic candidates.</p>\n<p>This criticism hits particularly close to home: <em>ThinkProgress</em> founder Faiz Shakir is now Sanders&rsquo;s 2020 campaign manager, and Sanders&rsquo;s Senate foreign policy chief, Matt Duss, was previously a <em>ThinkProgress</em> blogger and CAP staffer. Duss has <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/matt-duss-bernie-sanders-foreign-policy-blob/\">personally accused</a> CAP of interfering with <em>ThinkProgress</em>&rsquo;s editorial independence during his time there, specifically with regard to critical coverage of Israel.</p>\n<p>Although these days <em>ThinkProgress</em> appears to have <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=q5m0XOWnNu-6ggeniYIY&q=site%3Athinkprogress.org+netanyahu&btnK=Google+Search&oq=site%3Athinkprogress.org+netanyahu&gs_l=psy-ab.3...569.4386..4534...0.0..1.548.1783.2j2j0j1j1j1....2..0....1..gws-wiz.....0..35i39j0.u1DfUGgKQmM\">much more latitude</a> in criticizing Netanyahu as part of the global right-wing populist surge, CAP&rsquo;s leadership has often taken a much more conciliatory approach. This past September, Katulis <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/press/advisory/2018/09/20/458404/event-advisory-examining-trump-administrations-current-palestinian-policy/\">hosted</a> a CAP event featuring Jonathan Schanzer, an official of the far-right Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, in addition to more conventionally liberal panelists. Tanden, under <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/11/05/leaked-emails-from-pro-clinton-group-reveal-censorship-of-staff-on-israel-aipac-pandering-warped-militarism/\">reported</a> AIPAC and Israeli government pressure, hosted Netanyahu for a public conversation at CAP&rsquo;s offices in 2015. She later <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/37582\">conceded</a> in a hacked email to Podesta, published by WikiLeaks in 2016, that &ldquo;nothing we have done has pitted being a think tank and being ideologically action oriented against each other more harshly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At the end of the day,&rdquo; Tanden wrote, &ldquo;we had to choose.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "In front of a crowd of thousands at the AIPAC Policy Conference on March 26 in Washington DC, one speaker after another took turns condemning progressive Democrats. If there was a theme to the day\u2019s programming, it was to use the Left, and in particular the embattled freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, as a boogeyman and a punching bag.\nMitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, intoned about the \u201cgrowing tide of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment\u201d in the Democratic Party. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi bragged about using the allegations of antisemitism against Omar to justify a House bill against the \u201cantisemitic myth of dual loyalty.\u201d Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on a fuzzy livestream from Israel, directly called Omar an antisemite.\nThat same day, about a ten-minute walk from AIPAC\u2019s festivities, the pro-Israel lobby held another, smaller event \u2014 \u201can invitation-only roundtable with Michael Herzog, retired Israeli Defense forces brigadier general\u201d \u2014 at the H Street offices of the Center for American Progress (CAP), the most influential Democratic Party\u2013aligned think tank. According to a private event invitation obtained by Jewish Currents, Herzog planned to discuss \u201cthe challenges and opportunities that Israel faces in the current strategic landscape.\u201d\nAs far as AIPAC-friendly issue experts go, Herzog is fairly tame. Not particularly far to the right, most of his public writing expresses either a quiet concern about the threat Iran poses to Israel and other American allies in the region, or offers vanilla policy prescriptions to maintain the status quo of Israeli military control over Gaza and the West Bank. Previously a chief of staff in the Israeli Ministry of Defense who worked in negotiations with Palestinians, he presently serves as a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, an influential policy shop reportedly founded by AIPAC officials.\nBut the Herzog event reflects CAP\u2019s ambivalence about pursuing a progressive foreign policy and its repeated willingness to partner with reactionary foreign governments, including Israel, India, and the Persian Gulf monarchies.\n\u201cAs a research institution, CAP regularly holds both private and public discussions on a variety of topics \u2014 including America\u2019s approaches to foreign policy,\u201d a CAP spokesperson told Jewish Currents over email, noting that the group hosted Ilhan Omar in February and that the AIPAC-Herzog event \u201cwas just one in a series we have hosted on Middle East policy, including a recent public event on the Trump administration\u2019s approach to Palestine.\u201d A representative for AIPAC did not respond to a request for comment.\nCAP was conceived in the early 2000s by former Clinton administration officials as the Democratic Party\u2019s answer to explicitly right-wing think tanks like the Cato Institute, the American Enterprise Institute, and the Heritage Foundation. CAP\u2019s sister organization, the CAP Action Fund, with which it shares staff, is a 501(c)4 advocacy group that engages in more explicit lobbying work and houses the ThinkProgress blog and newsroom, which ostensibly operate independently of CAP. Taken as a unit, CAP and its Action Fund comprise the largest institution of liberal policy thought inside the Beltway, and its alumni can be found all across Democratic offices on Capitol Hill and in the ranks of Democratic 2020 presidential campaigns.\nThough much of CAP\u2019s funding has come from philanthropic sources with conventionally liberal profiles \u2014 for example, George Soros, the Sandler Foundation, and the Ford Foundation \u2014 the institution has long faced criticism from the Left over its corporate funding sources and the close proximity of its leadership to the Democratic establishment. CAP\u2019s chief executive, Neera Tanden, and its board chairman, John Podesta \u2014 both Clinton administration alumni \u2014 were senior advisers to Hillary Clinton throughout her failed 2016 presidential campaign.\nAnd on issues related to the Middle East, CAP has worked hand-in-hand with right-wingers and representatives of illiberal governments, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In recent years, such governments have increasingly relied on funding think tanks like CAP as part of their lobbying efforts in Washington.\nBrian Katulis, the CAP senior fellow responsible for the Herzog-AIPAC event, is a case in point. In 2017, Katulis worked with Ilan Goldenberg, a fellow at another national security think tank influential in Democratic circles, the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), to organize a trip to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the details of which were revealed in a 2017 report by The Intercept. According to leaked emails obtained by The Intercept, the trip cost around $150,000 and was paid for by the UAE government.\nThe participants \u2014 who included CNAS chief executive and former Hillary Clinton defense secretary prospect Michele Flournoy and fellows from CAP and the center-right American Enterprise Institute \u2014 were set to meet with Abu Dhabi\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a staunch ally of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman. The UAE government routinely imprisons dissidents, supports the horrific Saudi war in Yemen, and operates a brutal migrant labor system in which, according to Human Rights Watch, workers \u201cwho leave their employers can face punishment for \u2018absconding,\u2019 including fines, prison, and deportation.\u201d\nThe leaked CAP emails indicate that the think tank junket was a success. Writing to a lobbyist at the Harbour Group, the Washington firm employed by the UAE that pitched the trip, Katulis said that the UAE hosts \u201chit all the key points and having a diversity of meetings was a good thing, and it was great to see the top leadership.\u201d\nAfter firing two staffers suspected of leaking the emails to The Intercept, CAP said in late January that it would no longer take funding from antidemocratic governments. While the UAE \u201cfunding never impacted any CAP position or policy,\u201d a spokesperson told the Guardian, \u201ceverybody here agrees it\u2019s just the right thing to do.\u201d Before cutting ties, CAP admitted to having taken between $500,000 and $1 million from the UAE government.\nWhen it comes to progressive criticism of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, CAP has shown a similar willingness to buckle to outside pressure. Though CAP maintains that ThinkProgress operates with editorial independence, former staffers have repeatedly insisted that they were instructed to avoid criticizing the Israeli government.\nA former editor claimed in a Twitter thread on Sunday that in late 2011 and early 2012, CAP senior leadership barred ThinkProgress staffers from mentioning Netanyahu. The alleged censorship was a direct response to a right-wing campaign organized by a former senior AIPAC official to paint ThinkProgress\u2019s reporting and commentary as antisemitic. Further emails leaked to The Intercept show that Israel lobby activists (including Hillary Clinton loyalist Ann Lewis) successfully pressured Tanden to urge her staffers to back off Israel coverage.\nOver this past weekend, criticism of CAP\u2019s closeness to establishment Democratic politics, an undercurrent of the 2016 Democratic primary fight between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, once again spilled out into public view. Sanders\u2019s current presidential campaign released a letter accusing ThinkProgress of \u201ccounterproductive negative campaigning\u201d against Sanders and other Democratic candidates.\nThis criticism hits particularly close to home: ThinkProgress founder Faiz Shakir is now Sanders\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, and Sanders\u2019s Senate foreign policy chief, Matt Duss, was previously a ThinkProgress blogger and CAP staffer. Duss has personally accused CAP of interfering with ThinkProgress\u2019s editorial independence during his time there, specifically with regard to critical coverage of Israel.\nAlthough these days ThinkProgress appears to have much more latitude in criticizing Netanyahu as part of the global right-wing populist surge, CAP\u2019s leadership has often taken a much more conciliatory approach. This past September, Katulis hosted a CAP event featuring Jonathan Schanzer, an official of the far-right Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, in addition to more conventionally liberal panelists. Tanden, under reported AIPAC and Israeli government pressure, hosted Netanyahu for a public conversation at CAP\u2019s offices in 2015. She later conceded in a hacked email to Podesta, published by WikiLeaks in 2016, that \u201cnothing we have done has pitted being a think tank and being ideologically action oriented against each other more harshly.\u201d\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Tanden wrote, \u201cwe had to choose.\u201d",

Taken from a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSTNnKNFS0o\">March speech</a> at the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in which Omar discussed the prejudices experienced by Muslim Americans, here&rsquo;s the quote in context:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Here&rsquo;s the truth: far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen. And frankly I&rsquo;m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognized that some people did something and then all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Following quickly on the heels of the <em>Post</em>&rsquo;s bigoted cover, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-calling-rep-ilhan-omar-comments-good/story?id=62384114\">tweeted</a> an edited video superimposing Omar over 9/11 imagery with the caption &ldquo;WE WILL NEVER FORGET!&rdquo; A veritable army of other right-wing figures quickly followed suit.</p>\n<p>These more or less explicit attempts to link Omar, a Muslim woman &mdash; and by extension Muslims in general &mdash; to terrorism should have provoked both swift condemnation and unequivocal expressions of solidarity with the congresswoman from leading figures in the opposition.</p>\n<p>Or so you&rsquo;d think.</p>\n<p>Failing to even mention Omar let alone come to her defense, House majority leader Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1117024802403840000\">initial statement</a> instead accused Trump of misappropriating the memory of 9/11. Following a backlash, Pelosi eventually released a <a href=\"https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/41419/\">second statement</a> that actually referred to the congresswoman by name. And while said backlash may have played a role in inspiring other leading Democrats to speak, many of their initial responses proved little better.</p>\n<p>Copying Pelosi&rsquo;s template, liberal media darling <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetoORourke/status/1116892621115461632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1116892621115461632&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2F2019%2F04%2F14%2Fdemocrats-not-defend-ilhan-omar%2F\">Beto O&rsquo;Rourke</a> also failed to mention Omar as the target of the president&rsquo;s attack. Amy Klobuchar&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/1116910364065660930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1116910364065660930&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2F2019%2F04%2F14%2Fdemocrats-not-defend-ilhan-omar%2F\">statement</a>, meanwhile, seemed to imply there <em>had, </em>in fact, been something wrong with Omar&rsquo;s remarks, needlessly including the addendum: &ldquo;You can disagree with her words &mdash; as I have done before &mdash; but this video is wrong.&rdquo; Likewise, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenGillibrand/status/1117127662215008257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1117127662215008257&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com%2F2019%2F04%2F14%2Fdemocrats-not-defend-ilhan-omar%2F\">Kirsten Gillibrand&rsquo;s response</a> outrageously suggested that Omar had &ldquo;minimized the pain of 9/11 victims.&rdquo; True to form, Joe Biden said absolutely nothing. (<em>The Intercept</em>&rsquo;s Robert Mackey has collected every response from Democratic presidential contenders <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/04/14/democrats-not-defend-ilhan-omar/\">here</a>, including various amended second attempts.)</p>\n<p>While there&rsquo;s plenty of competition these days, it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine a starker illustration of Democratic fecklessness than the combination of foot-dragging, equivocation, and vaguery that initially followed the Right&rsquo;s latest onslaught against Omar. Faced with an example of the Trump presidency at its ugliest &mdash; in the form of a racist incitement campaign aimed at one of their own colleagues, no less &mdash; it took days for some to even utter a word, and a few still tried to have it both ways: condemning Trump&rsquo;s rhetoric in the abstract while maintaining a safe distance from Omar herself.</p>\n<p>It hardly needs saying, but meekness and vacillation of this kind <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/04/ilhan-omar-democratic-party-islamophobia-incitement\">will only further embolden the Right</a>. If Trump is determined to use a congresswoman and her words to attack Muslim Americans, the only adequate response is to defend both without hesitation.</p>",

                "text": "Last week, Donald Trump amplified a racist smear against a sitting Democratic lawmaker, potentially endangering her life.\nWith a few exceptions \u2014 including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who were both quick to release strongly worded statements, as did several House members \u2014 the initial responses offered by some Democrats, including several of those currently seeking the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, ranged from gutless to downright appalling.\nOn Thursday, the right-wing New York Post published a cover boasting an out-of-context quote from Minnesota representative Ilhan Omar in a nakedly cynical attempt to imply she was trivializing the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. Taken from a March speech at the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in which Omar discussed the prejudices experienced by Muslim Americans, here\u2019s the quote in context:\nHere\u2019s the truth: far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen. And frankly I\u2019m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognized that some people did something and then all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\nFollowing quickly on the heels of the Post\u2019s bigoted cover, Donald Trump tweeted an edited video superimposing Omar over 9/11 imagery with the caption \u201cWE WILL NEVER FORGET!\u201d A veritable army of other right-wing figures quickly followed suit.\nThese more or less explicit attempts to link Omar, a Muslim woman \u2014 and by extension Muslims in general \u2014 to terrorism should have provoked both swift condemnation and unequivocal expressions of solidarity with the congresswoman from leading figures in the opposition.\nOr so you\u2019d think.\nFailing to even mention Omar let alone come to her defense, House majority leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s initial statement instead accused Trump of misappropriating the memory of 9/11. Following a backlash, Pelosi eventually released a second statement that actually referred to the congresswoman by name. And while said backlash may have played a role in inspiring other leading Democrats to speak, many of their initial responses proved little better.\nCopying Pelosi\u2019s template, liberal media darling Beto O\u2019Rourke also failed to mention Omar as the target of the president\u2019s attack. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s statement, meanwhile, seemed to imply there had, in fact, been something wrong with Omar\u2019s remarks, needlessly including the addendum: \u201cYou can disagree with her words \u2014 as I have done before \u2014 but this video is wrong.\u201d Likewise, Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s response outrageously suggested that Omar had \u201cminimized the pain of 9/11 victims.\u201d True to form, Joe Biden said absolutely nothing. (The Intercept\u2019s Robert Mackey has collected every response from Democratic presidential contenders here, including various amended second attempts.)\nWhile there\u2019s plenty of competition these days, it\u2019s difficult to imagine a starker illustration of Democratic fecklessness than the combination of foot-dragging, equivocation, and vaguery that initially followed the Right\u2019s latest onslaught against Omar. Faced with an example of the Trump presidency at its ugliest \u2014 in the form of a racist incitement campaign aimed at one of their own colleagues, no less \u2014 it took days for some to even utter a word, and a few still tried to have it both ways: condemning Trump\u2019s rhetoric in the abstract while maintaining a safe distance from Omar herself.\nIt hardly needs saying, but meekness and vacillation of this kind will only further embolden the Right. If Trump is determined to use a congresswoman and her words to attack Muslim Americans, the only adequate response is to defend both without hesitation.",

Justin Sullivan / Getty</p> </figcaption></figure>\n<aside><p>This article is excerpted from John Patrick Leary&rsquo;s <em>Keywords: The New Language of Capitalism</em>, published by <a href=\"https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1227-keywords\">Haymarket Books</a>.</p> </aside>\n<p>For most of its early life, the word &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; was a pejorative, used to denounce false prophets and political dissidents. Thomas Hobbes used innovator in the seventeenth century as a synonym for a vain conspirator; Edmund Burke decried the innovators of revolutionary Paris as wreckers and miscreants; in 1837, a Catholic priest in Vermont devoted 320 pages to denouncing &ldquo;the Innovator,&rdquo; an archetypal heretic he summarized as an &ldquo;infidel and a sceptick at heart.&rdquo; The innovator&rsquo;s skepticism was a destructive conspiracy against the established order, whether in heaven or on Earth. And if the innovator styled himself a seer, he was a false prophet.</p>\n<p>By the turn of the last century, though, the practice of innovation had begun to shed these associations with plotting and heresy. A milestone may have been achieved around 1914, when <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vernon-and-Irene-Castle\">Vernon Castle</a>, America&rsquo;s foremost dance instructor, invented a &ldquo;decent,&rdquo; simplified American version of the Argentine tango and named it &ldquo;the Innovation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are now in a state of transmission to more beautiful dancing,&rdquo; said Mamie Fish, the famed New York socialite credited with naming the dance. She told the <em>Omaha Bee </em>in 1914 that &ldquo;this latest is a remarkably pretty dance, lacking in all the eccentricities and abandon of the &lsquo;tango,&rsquo; and it is not at all difficult to do.&rdquo; No longer a deviant sin, innovation &mdash; and &ldquo;The Innovation&rdquo; &mdash; had become positively decent.</p>\n<p>The contemporary ubiquity of innovation is an example of how the world of business, despite its claims of rationality and empirical precision, also summons its own enigmatic mythologies. Many of the words covered in my new book, <a href=\"https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1243-keywords\"><em>Keywords</em></a>, orbit this one, deriving their own authority from their connection to the power of innovation.</p>\n<p>The value of innovation is so widespread and so seemingly self-evident that questioning it might seem bizarre &mdash; like criticizing beauty, science, or penicillin, things that are, like innovation, treated as either abstract human values or socially useful things we can scarcely imagine doing without. And certainly, many things called innovations are, in fact, innovative in the strict sense: original processes or products that satisfy some human need.</p>\n<p>A scholar can uncover archival evidence that transforms how we understand the meaning of a historical event; an automotive engineer can develop new industrial processes to make a car lighter; a corporate executive can extract additional value from his employees by automating production. These are all new ways of doing something, but they are very different somethings. Some require a combination of dogged persistence and interpretive imagination; others make use of mathematical and technical expertise; others, organizational vision and practical ruthlessness.</p>\n<p>But innovation as it is used most often today comes with an implied sense of benevolence; we rarely talk of innovative credit-default swaps or innovative chemical weapons, but innovations they plainly are. The destructive skepticism of the false-prophet innovator has been redeemed as the profit-making insight of the technological visionary.</p>\n<p>Innovation is most popular today as a stand-alone concept, a kind of managerial spirit that permeates nearly every institutional setting, from nonprofits and newspapers to schools and children&rsquo;s toys. The Oxford English Dictionary (<em>OED</em>) defines innovation as &ldquo;the alteration of what is established by the introduction of new elements or forms.&rdquo; The earliest example the dictionary gives dates from the mid-sixteenth century; the adjectival &ldquo;innovative,&rdquo; meanwhile, was virtually unknown before the 1960s, but has exploded in popularity since.</p>\n<p>The verb &ldquo;to innovate&rdquo; has also seen a resurgence in recent years. The verb&rsquo;s intransitive meaning is &ldquo;to bring in or introduce novelties; to make changes <em>in</em> something established; to introduce innovations.&rdquo; Its earlier transitive meaning, &ldquo;To change (a thing) into something new; to alter; to renew&rdquo; is considered obsolete by the <em>OED</em>, but this meaning has seen something of a revival. This was the active meaning associated with conspirators and heretics, who were innovating the word of God or innovating government, in the sense of undermining or overthrowing each.</p>\n<p>The major conflict in innovation&rsquo;s history is that between its formerly prohibited, religious connotation and the salutary, practical meaning that predominates now. <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/models-innovation\">Beno&icirc;t Godin</a> has shown that innovation was recuperated as a secular concept in the late nineteenth century and into the twentieth, when it became a form of worldly praxis rather than theological reflection. Its grammar evolved along with this meaning. Instead of a discrete irruption in an established order, innovation as a mass noun became a visionary faculty that individuals could nurture and develop in practical ways in the world; it was also the <em>process </em>of applying this faculty (e.g., &ldquo;Lenovo&rsquo;s pursuit of innovation&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>Innovation as a count noun &mdash; that is, <em>an</em> innovation &mdash; was in turn the product of this process (e.g., &ldquo;the new iPhone features innovations like a high-resolution camera&rdquo;). But this new meaning evolved slowly. The concept&rsquo;s old link to deceit and conspiracy shadowed its meaning into the twentieth century.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Schumpeter\">Joseph Schumpeter</a>, who elaborated an influential theory of innovation three years before the debut of the Innovation tango in his 1911 book <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674879904\"><em>The Theory of Economic Development</em></a>, treated it as both a process and a product, with no sense of the old conspiratorial connotation. Schumpeter used &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; to describe capitalism&rsquo;s tendency toward tumult and transformation. Critical to his definition is the distinction Schumpeter makes between innovation as the refinement of a process or product, and invention, the creation of something entirely new.</p>\n<p>While Schumpeter was suspicious of the mythology of the inventor, the innovator, a more complex figure, was fundamental to the process he was describing. He understood innovation historically, as a process of economic transformation, but for him this historical process relied upon a creative, private agent to carry it out. Schumpeter&rsquo;s term for this agent was &ldquo;the entrepreneur.&rdquo; To innovate, Schumpeter wrote later, was to &ldquo;revolutionise the pattern of production by exploiting an invention or, more generally, an untried technological possibility for producing a new commodity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the second decade of the twentieth century, the word began to appear regularly in brand names and advertisements (and short-lived dance crazes) in its now familiar form: as a new, improved product or process. One of the first major products to be advertised as an innovation was the Innovation wardrobe trunk, which Gimbel&rsquo;s department store offered in 1915 to appeal to customers&rsquo; desires for the chimera of the new. (The trunks, the innovative features of which seem to have been their durability and &ldquo;roomy construction,&rdquo; were so popular that an &ldquo;innovation trunk&rdquo; became a generic name for any trunk, like &ldquo;Kleenex&rdquo; is for tissues.)</p>\n<p>Although innovation has been thoroughly rehabilitated and purged of subversion, it retains its old accent of individual prophetic vision, the talent of those who, as Hobbes said of &ldquo;innovators&rdquo; in 1651, &ldquo;suppose themselves wiser than others.&rdquo; It is not that innovation has lost its old moral connotation; instead, it has reversed. What we once regarded as deviant and deceitful is now praised as visionary.</p>\n<p>In a 2011 reflection on the late Apple computer executive Steve Jobs, probably the archetypal hero-innovator of our time, a <em>San Francisco Chronicle </em>author praised his &ldquo;constant desire to innovate and take chances.&rdquo; Here, the verb is used intransitively, in the more modern sense &mdash; that is, there is no direct object &mdash; but it lacks even the faintest hint of a reference. Jobs is no longer innovating <em>on</em> or <em>upon</em> anything in particular, which can make &ldquo;innovate&rdquo; sound like a kind of mantra. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t innovate every day and have a great understanding of your customers,&rdquo; a Denver processed cheese executive told the <em>Denver Post </em>in 2010, &ldquo;then you don&rsquo;t grow.&rdquo; And when the author of a <em>Wall Street Journal </em>obituary for Jobs writes that the Apple executive was a &ldquo;secular prophet&rdquo; who made innovation &ldquo;a perfectly secular form of hope,&rdquo; it is apparent that the term has never really lost its old association with prophecy.</p>\n<p>Other than mystifying creativity itself &mdash; which now looks more like an intuitive blast of inspiration, like an epiphany, and less like work &mdash; &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; gives creativity a specific professional, class dimension. It is almost always applied to white-collar and profit-seeking activities, although its increasing popularity in educational contexts only reflects the creeping influence of market-based models in this field. Quality organizations are supposed to cultivate it in their employees by giving them the freedom to work independently and creatively. Rarely do we hear of the innovative carpenter, plumber, or homemaker, in spite of the imagination, improvisation, and managerial skills required of each.</p>\n<p>Business publications issue rankings of the &ldquo;most innovative countries in the world,&rdquo; a curious usage that describes a) a capacity <em>constrained</em> by national borders, as if creativity dissipates or increases when one leaves passport control; and at the same time b) an intrinsic human talent unconstrained by fields, industries, or media.</p>\n<p>Another example of the term&rsquo;s increasing mystification is the acceptability of the tautological construction &ldquo;to innovate innovation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the Best at Innovating Innovation?&rdquo; asks the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>; the same publication sponsors a lucrative prize called the &ldquo;Innovating Innovation Challenge.&rdquo; One can &ldquo;innovate&rdquo; without having to act upon any process or idea other than the act of innovation itself. One simply innovates in circles, forever.</p>\n<p>Innovation is an example of the ways in which the production and circulation of commodities becomes imbued with fantastic and even theological properties detached from the labor that produces them, or in the case of many common uses of the verb &ldquo;to innovate,&rdquo; detached from any object. So when liberal politicians promote an &ldquo;innovation agenda&rdquo; that includes student debt forgiveness for &ldquo;startup founders,&rdquo; as Hillary Clinton did during her 2016 presidential campaign, it is unclear how this differs from any other form of corporate welfare. And when conservative politicians or CEOs lament how labor unions or public regulation of the private sector &ldquo;impede innovation,&rdquo; we can recognize this as both a ludicrous obfuscation but also another example of the bourgeois contempt for labor.</p>\n<p>Innovation is thus a theological concept which became a theory of commodity production and which has lately become a commodity itself. The innovator, meanwhile, has always been identified with novelty and visionary charisma. But where the innovator&rsquo;s visions were once widely feared as venal and destructive, now innovation is understood as the refinement of a technical process, in which creativity is turned to profit.</p>\n<p>But as the mythic figure of Jobs makes clear, rather than replacing prophecy with procedure, modern celebrations of innovation supplement each with the other. From the business world to education and politics, innovation is simultaneously spiritual and technological, both an individual&rsquo;s reaction against bureaucratic malaise and the spirit of anti-orthodox creativity to be cultivated by the same bureaucracy. Innovation, therefore, is a strangely contradictory concept, simultaneously grandiose and modest, saccharine and pessimistic.</p>\n<p>The prophetic meaning embedded deep in its history allows innovation to stand in for nearly any kind of positive transformation, doing for the twenty-first century what &ldquo;progress&rdquo; once did for the nineteenth and twentieth. In the United States, innovation also suggests a high-tech update to the myth of &ldquo;Yankee ingenuity&rdquo; or &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; &mdash; the spirit of mechanical cleverness and entrepreneurial energy once associated with New England&rsquo;s artisan class. Like the mythical inventors of the American industrial age &mdash; Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison tinkering in their workshops &mdash; the innovator is a model capitalist citizen for our times.</p>\n<p>But the object of most innovations today is more elusive: you can touch a telephone or a phonograph, but who can lay hands on an Amazon algorithm, a credit-default swap, a piece of proprietary Uber code, or an international free trade agreement? As an intangible, individualistic, yet strictly white-collar trait, innovation reframes the cruel fortunes of an unequal global economy as the logical products of a creative, visionary brilliance. In this new guise, the innovator retains both a touch of the prophet and a hint of the confidence man.</p>",

                "text": "This article is excerpted from John Patrick Leary\u2019s Keywords: The New Language of Capitalism, published by Haymarket Books.\nFor most of its early life, the word \u201cinnovation\u201d was a pejorative, used to denounce false prophets and political dissidents. Thomas Hobbes used innovator in the seventeenth century as a synonym for a vain conspirator; Edmund Burke decried the innovators of revolutionary Paris as wreckers and miscreants; in 1837, a Catholic priest in Vermont devoted 320 pages to denouncing \u201cthe Innovator,\u201d an archetypal heretic he summarized as an \u201cinfidel and a sceptick at heart.\u201d The innovator\u2019s skepticism was a destructive conspiracy against the established order, whether in heaven or on Earth. And if the innovator styled himself a seer, he was a false prophet.\nBy the turn of the last century, though, the practice of innovation had begun to shed these associations with plotting and heresy. A milestone may have been achieved around 1914, when Vernon Castle, America\u2019s foremost dance instructor, invented a \u201cdecent,\u201d simplified American version of the Argentine tango and named it \u201cthe Innovation.\u201d\n\u201cWe are now in a state of transmission to more beautiful dancing,\u201d said Mamie Fish, the famed New York socialite credited with naming the dance. She told the Omaha Bee in 1914 that \u201cthis latest is a remarkably pretty dance, lacking in all the eccentricities and abandon of the \u2018tango,\u2019 and it is not at all difficult to do.\u201d No longer a deviant sin, innovation \u2014 and \u201cThe Innovation\u201d \u2014 had become positively decent.\nThe contemporary ubiquity of innovation is an example of how the world of business, despite its claims of rationality and empirical precision, also summons its own enigmatic mythologies. Many of the words covered in my new book, Keywords, orbit this one, deriving their own authority from their connection to the power of innovation.\nThe value of innovation is so widespread and so seemingly self-evident that questioning it might seem bizarre \u2014 like criticizing beauty, science, or penicillin, things that are, like innovation, treated as either abstract human values or socially useful things we can scarcely imagine doing without. And certainly, many things called innovations are, in fact, innovative in the strict sense: original processes or products that satisfy some human need.\nA scholar can uncover archival evidence that transforms how we understand the meaning of a historical event; an automotive engineer can develop new industrial processes to make a car lighter; a corporate executive can extract additional value from his employees by automating production. These are all new ways of doing something, but they are very different somethings. Some require a combination of dogged persistence and interpretive imagination; others make use of mathematical and technical expertise; others, organizational vision and practical ruthlessness.\nBut innovation as it is used most often today comes with an implied sense of benevolence; we rarely talk of innovative credit-default swaps or innovative chemical weapons, but innovations they plainly are. The destructive skepticism of the false-prophet innovator has been redeemed as the profit-making insight of the technological visionary.\nInnovation is most popular today as a stand-alone concept, a kind of managerial spirit that permeates nearly every institutional setting, from nonprofits and newspapers to schools and children\u2019s toys. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines innovation as \u201cthe alteration of what is established by the introduction of new elements or forms.\u201d The earliest example the dictionary gives dates from the mid-sixteenth century; the adjectival \u201cinnovative,\u201d meanwhile, was virtually unknown before the 1960s, but has exploded in popularity since.\nThe verb \u201cto innovate\u201d has also seen a resurgence in recent years. The verb\u2019s intransitive meaning is \u201cto bring in or introduce novelties; to make changes in something established; to introduce innovations.\u201d Its earlier transitive meaning, \u201cTo change (a thing) into something new; to alter; to renew\u201d is considered obsolete by the OED, but this meaning has seen something of a revival. This was the active meaning associated with conspirators and heretics, who were innovating the word of God or innovating government, in the sense of undermining or overthrowing each.\nThe major conflict in innovation\u2019s history is that between its formerly prohibited, religious connotation and the salutary, practical meaning that predominates now. Beno\u00eet Godin has shown that innovation was recuperated as a secular concept in the late nineteenth century and into the twentieth, when it became a form of worldly praxis rather than theological reflection. Its grammar evolved along with this meaning. Instead of a discrete irruption in an established order, innovation as a mass noun became a visionary faculty that individuals could nurture and develop in practical ways in the world; it was also the process of applying this faculty (e.g., \u201cLenovo\u2019s pursuit of innovation\u201d).\nInnovation as a count noun \u2014 that is, an innovation \u2014 was in turn the product of this process (e.g., \u201cthe new iPhone features innovations like a high-resolution camera\u201d). But this new meaning evolved slowly. The concept\u2019s old link to deceit and conspiracy shadowed its meaning into the twentieth century.\nJoseph Schumpeter, who elaborated an influential theory of innovation three years before the debut of the Innovation tango in his 1911 book The Theory of Economic Development, treated it as both a process and a product, with no sense of the old conspiratorial connotation. Schumpeter used \u201cinnovation\u201d to describe capitalism\u2019s tendency toward tumult and transformation. Critical to his definition is the distinction Schumpeter makes between innovation as the refinement of a process or product, and invention, the creation of something entirely new.\nWhile Schumpeter was suspicious of the mythology of the inventor, the innovator, a more complex figure, was fundamental to the process he was describing. He understood innovation historically, as a process of economic transformation, but for him this historical process relied upon a creative, private agent to carry it out. Schumpeter\u2019s term for this agent was \u201cthe entrepreneur.\u201d To innovate, Schumpeter wrote later, was to \u201crevolutionise the pattern of production by exploiting an invention or, more generally, an untried technological possibility for producing a new commodity.\u201d\nIn the second decade of the twentieth century, the word began to appear regularly in brand names and advertisements (and short-lived dance crazes) in its now familiar form: as a new, improved product or process. One of the first major products to be advertised as an innovation was the Innovation wardrobe trunk, which Gimbel\u2019s department store offered in 1915 to appeal to customers\u2019 desires for the chimera of the new. (The trunks, the innovative features of which seem to have been their durability and \u201croomy construction,\u201d were so popular that an \u201cinnovation trunk\u201d became a generic name for any trunk, like \u201cKleenex\u201d is for tissues.)\nAlthough innovation has been thoroughly rehabilitated and purged of subversion, it retains its old accent of individual prophetic vision, the talent of those who, as Hobbes said of \u201cinnovators\u201d in 1651, \u201csuppose themselves wiser than others.\u201d It is not that innovation has lost its old moral connotation; instead, it has reversed. What we once regarded as deviant and deceitful is now praised as visionary.\nIn a 2011 reflection on the late Apple computer executive Steve Jobs, probably the archetypal hero-innovator of our time, a San Francisco Chronicle author praised his \u201cconstant desire to innovate and take chances.\u201d Here, the verb is used intransitively, in the more modern sense \u2014 that is, there is no direct object \u2014 but it lacks even the faintest hint of a reference. Jobs is no longer innovating on or upon anything in particular, which can make \u201cinnovate\u201d sound like a kind of mantra. \u201cIf you don\u2019t innovate every day and have a great understanding of your customers,\u201d a Denver processed cheese executive told the Denver Post in 2010, \u201cthen you don\u2019t grow.\u201d And when the author of a Wall Street Journal obituary for Jobs writes that the Apple executive was a \u201csecular prophet\u201d who made innovation \u201ca perfectly secular form of hope,\u201d it is apparent that the term has never really lost its old association with prophecy.\nOther than mystifying creativity itself \u2014 which now looks more like an intuitive blast of inspiration, like an epiphany, and less like work \u2014 \u201cinnovation\u201d gives creativity a specific professional, class dimension. It is almost always applied to white-collar and profit-seeking activities, although its increasing popularity in educational contexts only reflects the creeping influence of market-based models in this field. Quality organizations are supposed to cultivate it in their employees by giving them the freedom to work independently and creatively. Rarely do we hear of the innovative carpenter, plumber, or homemaker, in spite of the imagination, improvisation, and managerial skills required of each.\nBusiness publications issue rankings of the \u201cmost innovative countries in the world,\u201d a curious usage that describes a) a capacity constrained by national borders, as if creativity dissipates or increases when one leaves passport control; and at the same time b) an intrinsic human talent unconstrained by fields, industries, or media.\nAnother example of the term\u2019s increasing mystification is the acceptability of the tautological construction \u201cto innovate innovation.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s the Best at Innovating Innovation?\u201d asks the Harvard Business Review; the same publication sponsors a lucrative prize called the \u201cInnovating Innovation Challenge.\u201d One can \u201cinnovate\u201d without having to act upon any process or idea other than the act of innovation itself. One simply innovates in circles, forever.\nInnovation is an example of the ways in which the production and circulation of commodities becomes imbued with fantastic and even theological properties detached from the labor that produces them, or in the case of many common uses of the verb \u201cto innovate,\u201d detached from any object. So when liberal politicians promote an \u201cinnovation agenda\u201d that includes student debt forgiveness for \u201cstartup founders,\u201d as Hillary Clinton did during her 2016 presidential campaign, it is unclear how this differs from any other form of corporate welfare. And when conservative politicians or CEOs lament how labor unions or public regulation of the private sector \u201cimpede innovation,\u201d we can recognize this as both a ludicrous obfuscation but also another example of the bourgeois contempt for labor.\nInnovation is thus a theological concept which became a theory of commodity production and which has lately become a commodity itself. The innovator, meanwhile, has always been identified with novelty and visionary charisma. But where the innovator\u2019s visions were once widely feared as venal and destructive, now innovation is understood as the refinement of a technical process, in which creativity is turned to profit.\nBut as the mythic figure of Jobs makes clear, rather than replacing prophecy with procedure, modern celebrations of innovation supplement each with the other. From the business world to education and politics, innovation is simultaneously spiritual and technological, both an individual\u2019s reaction against bureaucratic malaise and the spirit of anti-orthodox creativity to be cultivated by the same bureaucracy. Innovation, therefore, is a strangely contradictory concept, simultaneously grandiose and modest, saccharine and pessimistic.\nThe prophetic meaning embedded deep in its history allows innovation to stand in for nearly any kind of positive transformation, doing for the twenty-first century what \u201cprogress\u201d once did for the nineteenth and twentieth. In the United States, innovation also suggests a high-tech update to the myth of \u201cYankee ingenuity\u201d or \u201cknow-how\u201d \u2014 the spirit of mechanical cleverness and entrepreneurial energy once associated with New England\u2019s artisan class. Like the mythical inventors of the American industrial age \u2014 Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison tinkering in their workshops \u2014 the innovator is a model capitalist citizen for our times.\nBut the object of most innovations today is more elusive: you can touch a telephone or a phonograph, but who can lay hands on an Amazon algorithm, a credit-default swap, a piece of proprietary Uber code, or an international free trade agreement? As an intangible, individualistic, yet strictly white-collar trait, innovation reframes the cruel fortunes of an unequal global economy as the logical products of a creative, visionary brilliance. In this new guise, the innovator retains both a touch of the prophet and a hint of the confidence man.",

                "html": "<p><u>California Sen.</u> Dianne Feinstein may feel like she was treated unfairly by young activists who have hammered her for not backing the Green New Deal resolution, but she has plenty of company. In upstate New York, Utah, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania, voters who feel a much greater sense of urgency than their elected officials have been reacting furiously to politicians who say that the attempt to turn the fossil fuel-based economy around in the next 12 years simply isn&rsquo;t realistic.</p>\n<p>Rep. Antonio Delgado, the freshman from New York&rsquo;s 19th District, was pressed repeatedly by constituents over his half-hearted support for the effort. He doesn&rsquo;t support the Green New Deal, he <a href=\"https://www.hudsonvalley360.com/article/delgado-draws-standing-room-only-crowd-town-hall-meeting\">told constituents at a town hall on February 16</a>, though he noted that he backed certain aspects of the bill. Delgado said that he&rsquo;s more interested in solutions that address the issues around climate change that can be solved now and that the bill as written does not sufficiently lay out a path for that kind of approach to the inevitability of climate crisis.</p>\n<p>Democrats, especially freshmen in the House, are having to face voters in their districts who find the lack of action on climate change to be a major issue for the new representatives. And those complaints aren&rsquo;t coming from blue districts &mdash; as with Delgado, freshmen Democrats from purple districts are facing resistance from constituents over their hesitancy to endorse progressive programs. Republicans aren&rsquo;t immune either. On Monday morning, roughly 250 young activists from the Sunrise Movement occupied the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., with 35 getting arrested.</p>\n<p>The main rhetorical device that Democratic skeptics of the Green New Deal have been employing begins with a confident assertion that they believe in climate science and that the crisis must be taken seriously, and they admire the ambition of the Green New Deal. But, they add, the resolution just can&rsquo;t pass a Republican Senate or be signed by President Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That resolution will not pass the Senate, and you can take that back to whoever sent you here,&rdquo; Feinstein told a group of children from the Bay Area who spoke with her in her office. She added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in the Senate for a quarter of a century, and I know what can pass, and I know what can&rsquo;t pass.&rdquo; She was crafting an alternate resolution, she said, which has a &ldquo;much better chance of passing.&rdquo; That, of course, is not remotely true. A Senate controlled by McConnell is about as likely to pass a resolution written by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as one penned by Feinstein, even if Feinstein&rsquo;s is much more moderate and does not push to turn the economy around in 12 years. The current debate is over what Democrats plan to implement if and when they take power &mdash; not what Trump will sign tomorrow.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am for the call to action,&rdquo; Delgado told his constituents, listing off a number of priorities, including green jobs and ending fossil fuel subsidies, though he was less clear on what that would precisely look like. Rather, Delgado said that he was interested in policies that presented change in the short term &mdash; closing the door, at least for now, on the more long-term goals of the Green New Deal.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what we want 15, 20, 30 years from now,&rdquo; said Delgado. &ldquo;What can we get done right now?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Many Democrats, some of whom are vying for the party&rsquo;s 2020 presidential nomination, are deflecting calls from the party&rsquo;s base to come out forcefully in favor of policies like Medicare for All, free four-year college, and the Green New Deal, that, while popular, would still require major political battles to get through Congress.</p>\n<p>By asserting their support of the broad principles undergirding the policies while rejecting the actual nuts and bolts of the legislation, Democrats are trying to have it both ways: keeping rhetorically in tune with the desires of the base but protecting the interests of the party&rsquo;s powerful establishment donor class in their actions.</p>\n<p>On Sunday night, Ocasio-Cortez responded to Feinstein, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GobAbiertoBOL/status/1099843291305119746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1099843291305119746&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonexaminer.com%2Fnews%2Faoc-rips-dianne-feinstein-after-her-confrontation-with-kids-over-green-new-deal\">saying on Instagram Live</a> and repeating later on Twitter that &ldquo;Climate delayers are the new climate deniers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that working on an issue for 30 years alone is what makes someone qualified to solve an issue,&rdquo; Ocasio-Cortez said on Instagram. &ldquo;That said, there are a lot of people that have been doing this work for decades that have proposed ambitious solutions for years and have not been listened to.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Protesters took McConnell&rsquo;s office holding up a banner that read &ldquo;Mitch, Look Us in the Eyes,&rdquo; while others lined the halls outside his office in the Senate Russell Office Building. The action followed previous protests outside his office in Louisville. Lily Gardner, a 15-year-old high school student in Kentucky, said she was there to ask McConnell to back the Green New Deal and &ldquo;to look us in the eye and explain to us why the $1.9 million he has taken from the fossil fuel corporations are more important than my future, my community&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am here urging him to consider the young Kentuckians who have traveled all the way to ask him why,&rdquo; Gardner said outside his office. &ldquo;Why are our voices not being listened to?

Susan Wild beat the Bernie Sanders-backed local minister Greg Edwards in the Democratic primary, before turning her red Lehigh Valley district blue. She was faced with a similar barrage of questions from constituents dissatisfied by the new representative&rsquo;s lukewarm take on the Green New Deal during a town hall on February 19. Wild doesn&rsquo;t support the Green New Deal, <a href=\"https://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/capitol-ideas/mc-nws-susan-wild-congress-takes-questions-20190219-story.html\">at least not yet</a> &mdash; she said that she was interested in seeing more details on the proposal before deciding whether to sign on &mdash; and that position rankled some supporters who felt that she wasn&rsquo;t representing their interests. In response to sustained criticism at the event, Wild told the crowd that she was interested in what could be done now &mdash; the same dodge used by Delgado.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What the scientists tell us we must do right now,&rdquo; said Wild, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The environment has long been a top concern of voters in the largely rural 19th, where Delgado <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/new-york-house-district-19\">unseated incumbent Republican John Faso</a> in the November midterm election with a narrow 50.2 percent to 47.3 percent margin of victory. Delgado&rsquo;s victory in the overwhelmingly white district was a win for upstate New York&rsquo;s liberal voters, who sent the state&rsquo;s first black representative from outside the New York City area to Washington on the back of a campaign that relied on activists and advocates for support &mdash; and included <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/12/06/antonio-delgado-green-new-deal/\">a call for the Green New Deal on the campaign trail</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am only beholden to you,&rdquo; Delgado <a href=\"https://radiokingston.org/en/broadcast/source-hillary-harvey/episodes/antonio-delgado-acceptance-speech\">said in a speech to supporters on election night</a>. &ldquo;No special interests, no outside voices.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The voters at the town hall, however, were less than convinced, asking the member of Congress whose interests he was representing by not signing onto the legislation. Environmental issues are a bipartisan affair for the 19th; Faso was a member of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus during his time in office.</p>\n<p>Feinstein was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/climate/feinstein-sunrise-green-new-deal.html\">confronted by activists from the Sunrise Movement</a> on February 22 about her lack of support for the Green New Deal legislation and responded with a blunt message for the next generation: There&rsquo;s neither time nor money nor &mdash; most importantly &mdash; the political will to effect meaningful change over the coming climate catastrophe. Feinstein&rsquo;s comments provoked outrage on social media after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sunrisemvmt/status/1099075460649107458\">video of the exchange</a> circulated on Friday night.</p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\"><p>This is how <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenFeinstein?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SenFeinstein</a> reacted to children asking her to support the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GreenNewDeal?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GreenNewDeal</a> resolution -- with smugness + disrespect.<br><br>This is a fight for our generation's survival.

On the campaign trail on February 15, <a href=\"https://www.wthr.com/article/latest-harris-says-green-new-deal-has-sound-principles\">California Sen. Kamala Harris told reporters</a> that the legislation was &ldquo;sound&rdquo; and that she planned to vote in favor of it.</p>\n<p>Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar took a different approach when she <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2019/02/20/amy-klobuchar-needs-to-learn-messaging-and-stop-trash-talking-the-green-new-deal/\">said on Fox News</a> program &ldquo;Special Report&rdquo; with Bret Baier on February 12 that while she supported the principle of the legislation, the actual nuts and bolts of what the law would look like might change her support as that time grew nearer.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If it got down to the nitty-gritty of an actual legislation, as opposed to, &lsquo;Oh, here&rsquo;s some goals we have,&rsquo; that would be different for me,&rdquo; said Klobuchar.</p>\n<p>Yet not all congressional Democrats are keeping a distance from the legislation. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, <a href=\"https://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/420128-324264-wyden-revamp-tax-breaks-as-part-of-green-new-deal\">speaking to constituents on February 15</a>, said that the Green New Deal was a way to &ldquo;get more green for less green&rdquo; and remarked that he&rsquo;d like to see Republicans sign onto the plan, if only for its fiscal responsibility.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;One of the things I should be doing is to get Congress to kick the carbon habit,&rdquo; said Wyden, who spoke at the resolution&rsquo;s unveiling on Capitol Hill, alongside authors Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey.</p>\n<p>If the reaction to Delgado&rsquo;s decision to avoid supporting the Green New Deal in his rural, majority white, purple district is an indication of the mood of the electorate, then Democrats running on a more centrist or right-wing platform in the next election may be in danger.</p>\n<p>Akiva Hirsch, who asked Delgado about supporting the Green New Deal during the town hall, told The Intercept that given the severity of the problem of climate change, and the possibility of irreversible catastrophe in only a decade, Delgado&rsquo;s response was insufficient. Hirsch and a group of friends from Bard College, which is in Delgado&rsquo;s district, told The Intercept that they were registered voters in the district.</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t all for Delgado on the Green New Deal, however, as at least one of the town hall attendees expressed support for his rejection of the proposal.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m 100 percent happy that you didn&rsquo;t sign onto the Green New Deal,&rdquo; said constituent Hillary Thomas. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a publicity piece for the people that are promoting it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Thomas told The Intercept that she voted for Delgado&rsquo;s Republican opponent, John Faso, in last November&rsquo;s election.</p>\n<p>Ocasio-Cortez said that politicians who aren&rsquo;t proposing ambitious solutions are harming the effort. &ldquo;If you think a carbon tax alone is going to fix climate change, you&rsquo;re part of the problem,&rdquo; she said. We basically need to propose a solution on the scale and of the magnitude of the problem. We have one shot. &hellip; To be very frank, people didn&rsquo;t try. For 30 or 40 years, they wrung their hands and said it&rsquo;s too complex. And now people are dying.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Wait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn&rsquo;t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren&rsquo;t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don&rsquo;t have ads, so we depend on our members &mdash; 35,000 and counting &mdash; to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn&rsquo;t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month. That&rsquo;s all it takes to support the journalism you rely on.</p>",

                "text": "California Sen. Dianne Feinstein may feel like she was treated unfairly by young activists who have hammered her for not backing the Green New Deal resolution, but she has plenty of company. In upstate New York, Utah, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania, voters who feel a much greater sense of urgency than their elected officials have been reacting furiously to politicians who say that the attempt to turn the fossil fuel-based economy around in the next 12 years simply isn\u2019t realistic.\nRep. Antonio Delgado, the freshman from New York\u2019s 19th District, was pressed repeatedly by constituents over his half-hearted support for the effort. He doesn\u2019t support the Green New Deal, he told constituents at a town hall on February 16, though he noted that he backed certain aspects of the bill. Delgado said that he\u2019s more interested in solutions that address the issues around climate change that can be solved now and that the bill as written does not sufficiently lay out a path for that kind of approach to the inevitability of climate crisis.\nDemocrats, especially freshmen in the House, are having to face voters in their districts who find the lack of action on climate change to be a major issue for the new representatives. And those complaints aren\u2019t coming from blue districts \u2014 as with Delgado, freshmen Democrats from purple districts are facing resistance from constituents over their hesitancy to endorse progressive programs. Republicans aren\u2019t immune either. On Monday morning, roughly 250 young activists from the Sunrise Movement occupied the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., with 35 getting arrested.\nThe main rhetorical device that Democratic skeptics of the Green New Deal have been employing begins with a confident assertion that they believe in climate science and that the crisis must be taken seriously, and they admire the ambition of the Green New Deal. But, they add, the resolution just can\u2019t pass a Republican Senate or be signed by President Donald Trump.\n\u201cThat resolution will not pass the Senate, and you can take that back to whoever sent you here,\u201d Feinstein told a group of children from the Bay Area who spoke with her in her office. She added, \u201cI\u2019ve been in the Senate for a quarter of a century, and I know what can pass, and I know what can\u2019t pass.\u201d She was crafting an alternate resolution, she said, which has a \u201cmuch better chance of passing.\u201d That, of course, is not remotely true. A Senate controlled by McConnell is about as likely to pass a resolution written by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as one penned by Feinstein, even if Feinstein\u2019s is much more moderate and does not push to turn the economy around in 12 years. The current debate is over what Democrats plan to implement if and when they take power \u2014 not what Trump will sign tomorrow.\n\u201cI am for the call to action,\u201d Delgado told his constituents, listing off a number of priorities, including green jobs and ending fossil fuel subsidies, though he was less clear on what that would precisely look like. Rather, Delgado said that he was interested in policies that presented change in the short term \u2014 closing the door, at least for now, on the more long-term goals of the Green New Deal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what we want 15, 20, 30 years from now,\u201d said Delgado. \u201cWhat can we get done right now?\u201d\nMany Democrats, some of whom are vying for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, are deflecting calls from the party\u2019s base to come out forcefully in favor of policies like Medicare for All, free four-year college, and the Green New Deal, that, while popular, would still require major political battles to get through Congress.\nBy asserting their support of the broad principles undergirding the policies while rejecting the actual nuts and bolts of the legislation, Democrats are trying to have it both ways: keeping rhetorically in tune with the desires of the base but protecting the interests of the party\u2019s powerful establishment donor class in their actions.\nOn Sunday night, Ocasio-Cortez responded to Feinstein, saying on Instagram Live and repeating later on Twitter that \u201cClimate delayers are the new climate deniers.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that working on an issue for 30 years alone is what makes someone qualified to solve an issue,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said on Instagram. \u201cThat said, there are a lot of people that have been doing this work for decades that have proposed ambitious solutions for years and have not been listened to.\u201d\nProtesters took McConnell\u2019s office holding up a banner that read \u201cMitch, Look Us in the Eyes,\u201d while others lined the halls outside his office in the Senate Russell Office Building. The action followed previous protests outside his office in Louisville. Lily Gardner, a 15-year-old high school student in Kentucky, said she was there to ask McConnell to back the Green New Deal and \u201cto look us in the eye and explain to us why the $1.9 million he has taken from the fossil fuel corporations are more important than my future, my community\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\u201cI am here urging him to consider the young Kentuckians who have traveled all the way to ask him why,\u201d Gardner said outside his office. \u201cWhy are our voices not being listened to? To back the only comprehensive climate solution we have because I am scared. We are all scared and we must be listened to.\u201d\nMcConnell, meanwhile, was nowhere to be found. The demonstration ended with the young protesters singing \u201cwhich side are you on?\u201d Shortly after, Capitol Police gave the crowd several warnings before arresting dozens of members of the group and escorting them out of the building.\nRep. Ben McAdams, the new Democratic congressperson from Utah\u2019s 4th District, who unseated incumbent Republican Mia Love in November by a razor-thin margin, told constituents at a town hall on February 19 that while he supported the Green New Deal\u2019s aspirations in principle, he worried that the legislation wouldn\u2019t make it through the House.\n\u201cIt seems expensive,\u201d said McAdams. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s feasible.\u201d\nIn Pennsylvania, freshman Rep. Susan Wild beat the Bernie Sanders-backed local minister Greg Edwards in the Democratic primary, before turning her red Lehigh Valley district blue. She was faced with a similar barrage of questions from constituents dissatisfied by the new representative\u2019s lukewarm take on the Green New Deal during a town hall on February 19. Wild doesn\u2019t support the Green New Deal, at least not yet \u2014 she said that she was interested in seeing more details on the proposal before deciding whether to sign on \u2014 and that position rankled some supporters who felt that she wasn\u2019t representing their interests. In response to sustained criticism at the event, Wild told the crowd that she was interested in what could be done now \u2014 the same dodge used by Delgado.\n\u201cWhat the scientists tell us we must do right now,\u201d said Wild, \u201clet\u2019s do it.\u201d\nThe environment has long been a top concern of voters in the largely rural 19th, where Delgado unseated incumbent Republican John Faso in the November midterm election with a narrow 50.2 percent to 47.3 percent margin of victory. Delgado\u2019s victory in the overwhelmingly white district was a win for upstate New York\u2019s liberal voters, who sent the state\u2019s first black representative from outside the New York City area to Washington on the back of a campaign that relied on activists and advocates for support \u2014 and included a call for the Green New Deal on the campaign trail.\n\u201cI am only beholden to you,\u201d Delgado said in a speech to supporters on election night. \u201cNo special interests, no outside voices.\u201d\nThe voters at the town hall, however, were less than convinced, asking the member of Congress whose interests he was representing by not signing onto the legislation. Environmental issues are a bipartisan affair for the 19th; Faso was a member of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus during his time in office.\nFeinstein was confronted by activists from the Sunrise Movement on February 22 about her lack of support for the Green New Deal legislation and responded with a blunt message for the next generation: There\u2019s neither time nor money nor \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the political will to effect meaningful change over the coming climate catastrophe. Feinstein\u2019s comments provoked outrage on social media after video of the exchange circulated on Friday night.\nThis is how @SenFeinstein reacted to children asking her to support the #GreenNewDeal resolution -- with smugness + disrespect.\nThis is a fight for our generation's survival. Her reaction is why young people desperately want new leadership in Congress. pic.twitter.com/0zAkaxruMI\n\u2014 Sunrise Movement ? (@sunrisemvmt) February 22, 2019\nThe issue is becoming a hot-button topic in the party\u2019s presidential primary, too, with candidates being forced to answer for their support \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 for the Green New Deal in pressers and stops across early primary states. On the campaign trail on February 15, California Sen. Kamala Harris told reporters that the legislation was \u201csound\u201d and that she planned to vote in favor of it.\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar took a different approach when she said on Fox News program \u201cSpecial Report\u201d with Bret Baier on February 12 that while she supported the principle of the legislation, the actual nuts and bolts of what the law would look like might change her support as that time grew nearer.\n\u201cIf it got down to the nitty-gritty of an actual legislation, as opposed to, \u2018Oh, here\u2019s some goals we have,\u2019 that would be different for me,\u201d said Klobuchar.\nYet not all congressional Democrats are keeping a distance from the legislation. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, speaking to constituents on February 15, said that the Green New Deal was a way to \u201cget more green for less green\u201d and remarked that he\u2019d like to see Republicans sign onto the plan, if only for its fiscal responsibility.\n\u201cOne of the things I should be doing is to get Congress to kick the carbon habit,\u201d said Wyden, who spoke at the resolution\u2019s unveiling on Capitol Hill, alongside authors Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey.\nIf the reaction to Delgado\u2019s decision to avoid supporting the Green New Deal in his rural, majority white, purple district is an indication of the mood of the electorate, then Democrats running on a more centrist or right-wing platform in the next election may be in danger.\nAkiva Hirsch, who asked Delgado about supporting the Green New Deal during the town hall, told The Intercept that given the severity of the problem of climate change, and the possibility of irreversible catastrophe in only a decade, Delgado\u2019s response was insufficient. Hirsch and a group of friends from Bard College, which is in Delgado\u2019s district, told The Intercept that they were registered voters in the district.\nIt wasn\u2019t all for Delgado on the Green New Deal, however, as at least one of the town hall attendees expressed support for his rejection of the proposal.\n\u201cI\u2019m 100 percent happy that you didn\u2019t sign onto the Green New Deal,\u201d said constituent Hillary Thomas. \u201cI think it\u2019s a publicity piece for the people that are promoting it.\u201d\nThomas told The Intercept that she voted for Delgado\u2019s Republican opponent, John Faso, in last November\u2019s election.\nOcasio-Cortez said that politicians who aren\u2019t proposing ambitious solutions are harming the effort. \u201cIf you think a carbon tax alone is going to fix climate change, you\u2019re part of the problem,\u201d she said. We basically need to propose a solution on the scale and of the magnitude of the problem. We have one shot. \u2026 To be very frank, people didn\u2019t try. For 30 or 40 years, they wrung their hands and said it\u2019s too complex. And now people are dying.\u201d\nWait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn\u2019t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren\u2019t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don\u2019t have ads, so we depend on our members \u2014 35,000 and counting \u2014 to help us hold the powerful to account.

Julia Salazar.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Photo: Scott Heins</p>\n<p><u>Tears welled up</u> in the eyes of many of the 150-plus people gathered in New York City&rsquo;s Foley Square on Monday afternoon. Not all the tears came because of the frigid winds of the &ldquo;bomb cyclone&rdquo; blowing through the region. Instead, standing before the crowd, Cecilia Gentili almost began to cry because of the strides taken for the cause she was there to promote. &ldquo;It feels surreal to be here, talking about this. It&rsquo;s very emotional for me as a former sex worker,&rdquo; said Gentili, an advocate for sex workers&rsquo; and transgender rights. &ldquo;We will decriminalize sex work. We&rsquo;re doing it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Behind Gentili stood more than 30 supporters of sex workers&rsquo; rights, holding protest signs bearing slogans like &ldquo;Sex work is work&rdquo; and &ldquo;Arrests only save police budgets.&rdquo; The rally and press conference marked the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.decrimny.org/\">DecrimNY</a> campaign that has a coalition of over 20 organizations pushing for the full decriminalization of sex work, the decarceration of sex workers, and the destigmatization of that most censured industry. The launch also celebrated the coming introduction in the New York State House and Senate of what DecrimNY described as &ldquo;the most comprehensive state-level decriminalization bill in the country.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote data-reactid=\"201\">&ldquo;This is one of the most taboo conversations for us to be having as a society. And we are not going to stop.&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;This is one of the most taboo conversations for us to be having as a society,&rdquo; New York state Sen. Jessica Ramos told the Foley Square rally. &ldquo;And we are not going to stop.&rdquo; Ramos will be <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-decriminalize-sex-work-in-ny-20190221-story.html\">introducing</a> the decriminalization bill this spring alongside newly elected democratic socialist Sen. Julia Salazar, Sen. Brad Hoylman, and Assembly Member Richard Gottfried, all Democrats.</p>\n<p>The mere introduction of decriminalization legislation marks a major and hard-won point of progress in the public discussion around sex workers&rsquo; rights. It is a welcome statement for those who have been long disappointed in politicians with allegedly progressive agendas standing on the wrong side of history when it comes to sex workers&rsquo; rights. (Think of when Sen. Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/04/19/bernie-sanders-may-sing-cardi-bs-praises-but-sex-workers-say-hes-no-ally/\">voted</a> to support the misleadingly titled Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act and Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, known as <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/06/13/sesta-fosta-sex-work-criminalize-advocacy/\">SESTA-FOSTA</a>, which cripples sex workers&rsquo; ability to work <a href=\"http://www.citypages.com/news/how-congress-attempt-to-rescue-sex-workers-threatens-their-safety-instead/482720031\">safely</a> online.)</p>\n<p>Rejecting longstanding criminal justice frameworks, which insist that sex workers are always both criminal and victim, full decriminalization would recognize that sex work is work &mdash; and not the business of the police and courts. For many, sex work may not be good work, or always free of exploitation, and it may be resorted to as a means of survival. But the very same is true of many jobs in which workers are nonetheless deemed worthy of rights and legal protections as workers.</p>\n<p>The history of labor struggle is not the history of workers fighting for the love of their work; as authors and sex workers Juno Mac and Molly Smith <a href=\"http://bostonreview.net/gender-sexuality/juno-mac-molly-smith-sex-not-problem-sex-work\">remind</a> us in their new book, &ldquo;Revolting Prostitutes,&rdquo; when British coal miners in the 1980s went on strike, it was not because they loved mining. And, as the advocates and elected officials pushing for sex work decriminalization make clear, any feminist and workers&rsquo; rights movement worthy of the description would be a failure if sex workers are excluded.</p>\n<p>To fight for the decriminalization of sex work is to fight for and with society&rsquo;s most vulnerable and marginalized communities, in particular women of color and of immigration backgrounds, especially transgender women who often rely on sex work when discriminated against in other industries. Black women account for 94 percent <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-butler-fosta-sex-work_us_5ad75366e4b0e4d0715c4bf8\">of people</a> arrested for the absurd and capacious charge of &ldquo;loitering for the purposes of prostitution&rdquo; in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. Thus, to ignore the struggle for sex workers&rsquo; rights is de facto to allow their lives not to matter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I ran away from an abusive foster home and traded sex to access housing when I was 15,&rdquo; said Jessica Raven, executive director of the Audre Lorde Project and a member of the DecrimNY steering committee, in a statement. &ldquo;Whether we are trading sex by choice, by circumstance, or by coercion, we all need the same things: We need safety from violence, freedom from criminalization, and access to basic needs like housing and healthcare.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><u>Only full decriminalization</u> will satisfy Raven and others in the DecrimNY coalition. The so-called Nordic model, in which only buyers of sex or third parties face criminalization, forces sex workers into the shadows. &ldquo;In reality, these laws target loved ones, family, landlords, drivers and other people providing care and service to sex workers,&rdquo; Raven said in her statement. Meanwhile, the widespread use of Human Trafficking Intervention Courts, which treat all arrested sex workers as trafficking victims, continue to place sex workers in <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/inside-ny-courts-where-sex-workers-are-painted-as-victims-and-treated-as-criminals/\">frameworks of criminalization</a> and regularly offer up undocumented immigrants to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who haunt the court rooms.</p>\n<p>Full decriminalization will, of course, not offer economic justice and material safety for the vulnerable communities who turn to sex work for survival. It would, nonetheless, help reduce the violence of discriminatory policing &mdash; or the purported grounds for it &mdash; in their lives. With full decriminalization, law enforcement officers would no longer be able to use policing prostitution as a pretext for harassing trans women, raiding immigrants&rsquo; businesses, and <a href=\"https://theslot.jezebel.com/when-will-new-york-state-finally-update-its-rape-shield-1830767981\">discrediting</a> sex workers who report abuse. Since the November 2018 election handed the New York Senate to the Democrats &mdash; while ushering in politicians like Salazar with progressive platforms &mdash; the notion that the state penal code could soon be adjusted to decriminalize sex work is no mere idealism.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It depends what you consider soon,&rdquo; said Jared Trujillo of the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, another member of the DecrimNY steering committee. Trujillo, also a former sex worker, told The Intercept that legislation to repeal New York&rsquo;s loitering for prostitution law, and legislation that would disallow using the possession of condoms as evidence of prostitution, could be passed in the next congressional session. &ldquo;Full decriminalization could happen in a few years,&rdquo; he said. Fellow DecrimNY members in Foley Square echoed his optimism. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so close that we can taste it,&rdquo; Gentili told the crowd.</p>\n<p>The potential for decriminalization may have been ushered in by last year&rsquo;s election, but it was built on the backs of sex workers struggling for their rights and their lives for decades. As Trujillo noted, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, which inaugurated the gay rights revolution &mdash; and were started by trans sex workers. Anything but decriminalization is discrimination; it can&rsquo;t come soon enough.</p>\n<p>Wait!

                "text": "Photo: Scott Heins\nTears welled up in the eyes of many of the 150-plus people gathered in New York City\u2019s Foley Square on Monday afternoon. Not all the tears came because of the frigid winds of the \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d blowing through the region. Instead, standing before the crowd, Cecilia Gentili almost began to cry because of the strides taken for the cause she was there to promote. \u201cIt feels surreal to be here, talking about this. It\u2019s very emotional for me as a former sex worker,\u201d said Gentili, an advocate for sex workers\u2019 and transgender rights. \u201cWe will decriminalize sex work. We\u2019re doing it.\u201d\nBehind Gentili stood more than 30 supporters of sex workers\u2019 rights, holding protest signs bearing slogans like \u201cSex work is work\u201d and \u201cArrests only save police budgets.\u201d The rally and press conference marked the launch of the DecrimNY campaign that has a coalition of over 20 organizations pushing for the full decriminalization of sex work, the decarceration of sex workers, and the destigmatization of that most censured industry. The launch also celebrated the coming introduction in the New York State House and Senate of what DecrimNY described as \u201cthe most comprehensive state-level decriminalization bill in the country.\u201d\n\u201cThis is one of the most taboo conversations for us to be having as a society. And we are not going to stop.\u201d\n\u201cThis is one of the most taboo conversations for us to be having as a society,\u201d New York state Sen. Jessica Ramos told the Foley Square rally. \u201cAnd we are not going to stop.\u201d Ramos will be introducing the decriminalization bill this spring alongside newly elected democratic socialist Sen. Julia Salazar, Sen. Brad Hoylman, and Assembly Member Richard Gottfried, all Democrats.\nThe mere introduction of decriminalization legislation marks a major and hard-won point of progress in the public discussion around sex workers\u2019 rights. It is a welcome statement for those who have been long disappointed in politicians with allegedly progressive agendas standing on the wrong side of history when it comes to sex workers\u2019 rights. (Think of when Sen. Bernie Sanders voted to support the misleadingly titled Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act and Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, known as SESTA-FOSTA, which cripples sex workers\u2019 ability to work safely online.)\nRejecting longstanding criminal justice frameworks, which insist that sex workers are always both criminal and victim, full decriminalization would recognize that sex work is work \u2014 and not the business of the police and courts. For many, sex work may not be good work, or always free of exploitation, and it may be resorted to as a means of survival. But the very same is true of many jobs in which workers are nonetheless deemed worthy of rights and legal protections as workers.\nThe history of labor struggle is not the history of workers fighting for the love of their work; as authors and sex workers Juno Mac and Molly Smith remind us in their new book, \u201cRevolting Prostitutes,\u201d when British coal miners in the 1980s went on strike, it was not because they loved mining. And, as the advocates and elected officials pushing for sex work decriminalization make clear, any feminist and workers\u2019 rights movement worthy of the description would be a failure if sex workers are excluded.\nTo fight for the decriminalization of sex work is to fight for and with society\u2019s most vulnerable and marginalized communities, in particular women of color and of immigration backgrounds, especially transgender women who often rely on sex work when discriminated against in other industries. Black women account for 94 percent of people arrested for the absurd and capacious charge of \u201cloitering for the purposes of prostitution\u201d in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. Thus, to ignore the struggle for sex workers\u2019 rights is de facto to allow their lives not to matter.\n\u201cI ran away from an abusive foster home and traded sex to access housing when I was 15,\u201d said Jessica Raven, executive director of the Audre Lorde Project and a member of the DecrimNY steering committee, in a statement. \u201cWhether we are trading sex by choice, by circumstance, or by coercion, we all need the same things: We need safety from violence, freedom from criminalization, and access to basic needs like housing and healthcare.\u201d\nOnly full decriminalization will satisfy Raven and others in the DecrimNY coalition. The so-called Nordic model, in which only buyers of sex or third parties face criminalization, forces sex workers into the shadows. \u201cIn reality, these laws target loved ones, family, landlords, drivers and other people providing care and service to sex workers,\u201d Raven said in her statement. Meanwhile, the widespread use of Human Trafficking Intervention Courts, which treat all arrested sex workers as trafficking victims, continue to place sex workers in frameworks of criminalization and regularly offer up undocumented immigrants to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who haunt the court rooms.\nFull decriminalization will, of course, not offer economic justice and material safety for the vulnerable communities who turn to sex work for survival. It would, nonetheless, help reduce the violence of discriminatory policing \u2014 or the purported grounds for it \u2014 in their lives. With full decriminalization, law enforcement officers would no longer be able to use policing prostitution as a pretext for harassing trans women, raiding immigrants\u2019 businesses, and discrediting sex workers who report abuse. Since the November 2018 election handed the New York Senate to the Democrats \u2014 while ushering in politicians like Salazar with progressive platforms \u2014 the notion that the state penal code could soon be adjusted to decriminalize sex work is no mere idealism.\n\u201cIt depends what you consider soon,\u201d said Jared Trujillo of the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, another member of the DecrimNY steering committee. Trujillo, also a former sex worker, told The Intercept that legislation to repeal New York\u2019s loitering for prostitution law, and legislation that would disallow using the possession of condoms as evidence of prostitution, could be passed in the next congressional session. \u201cFull decriminalization could happen in a few years,\u201d he said. Fellow DecrimNY members in Foley Square echoed his optimism. \u201cIt\u2019s so close that we can taste it,\u201d Gentili told the crowd.\nThe potential for decriminalization may have been ushered in by last year\u2019s election, but it was built on the backs of sex workers struggling for their rights and their lives for decades. As Trujillo noted, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, which inaugurated the gay rights revolution \u2014 and were started by trans sex workers. Anything but decriminalization is discrimination; it can\u2019t come soon enough.\nWait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn\u2019t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren\u2019t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don\u2019t have ads, so we depend on our members \u2014 35,000 and counting \u2014 to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn\u2019t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month. That\u2019s all it takes to support the journalism you rely on.",

Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren&rsquo;t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don&rsquo;t have ads, so we depend on our members &mdash; 35,000 and counting &mdash; to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn&rsquo;t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month. That&rsquo;s all it takes to support the journalism you rely on.</p>",

                "text": "Photo: Carolyn Kaster/AP\nDo you know what really annoys me about the media\u2019s coverage of U.S. politics, and especially the Democratic Party?\nGoogle the words \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201ccentrist\u201d and a small group of names will instantly appear: Michael Bloomberg, Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden, and, yes, Howard Schultz.\nBloomberg is considered a \u201ccentrist thought leader\u201d (Vanity Fair). Klobuchar is the \u201cstraight-shooting pragmatist\u201d (Time). Biden is the \u201cquintessential centrist\u201d (CNN) and the \u201clast hurrah for moderate Democrats\u201d (New York magazine). Shultz is gifted with high-profile interview slots to make his \u201ccentrist independent\u201d pitch to voters.\nNow Google the freshman House Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She\u2019s been dubbed a member of the \u201cloony left\u201d (Washington Post), a \u201cprogressive firebrand\u201d (Reuters), and a \u201cliberal bomb thrower\u201d (New York Times).\nGot that? Biden, Schultz and Co., we are told, sit firmly in the middle of American politics; Ocasio-Cortez stands far out on its fringes.\nThis is a brazen distortion of reality, a shameless and demonstrable lie that is repeated day after day in newspaper op-eds and cable news headlines.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to call what AOC is doing as far-lefty, but nothing could be farther from the truth,\u201d Nick Hanauer, the venture capitalist and progressive activist, told MSNBC in January. \u201cWhen you advocate for economic policies that benefit the broad majority of citizens, that\u2019s true centrism. What Howard Schultz represents, the centrism that he represents, is really just trickle-down economics.\u201d\n\u201cHe is not the centrist,\u201d continued Hanauer. \u201cAOC is the centrist.\u201d\nHanauer is right. And Bernie Sanders is centrist too \u2014 smeared as an \u201cideologue\u201d (The Economist) and \u201cdangerously far left\u201d (Chicago Tribune). So too is Elizabeth Warren \u2014 dismissed as a \u201cradical extremist\u201d (Las Vegas Review-Journal) and a \u201cclass warrior\u201d (Fox News).\nThe inconvenient truth that our lazy media elites do so much to ignore is that Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders, and Warren are much closer in their views to the vast majority of ordinary Americans than the Bloombergs or the Bidens. They are the true centrists, the real moderates; they represent the actual political middle.\nDon\u2019t believe me? Take Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s signature issue: the Green New Deal. Former George W. Bush speechwriter \u2014 and torture advocate \u2014 Marc Thiessen claims that the Green New Deal will \u201cmake the Democrats unelectable in 2020.\u201d The Economist agrees: \u201cThe bold plan could make the party unelectable in conservative-leaning states.\u201d The Green New Deal \u201cwill not pass the Senate, and you can take that back to whoever sent you here and tell them,\u201d a testy Diane Feinstein, the senior and supposedly \u201cmoderate\u201d Democratic senator from California, told a bunch of kids in a viral video.\nBut here is the reality: The Green New Deal is extremely popular and has massive bipartisan support. A recent survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University found that a whopping 81 percent of voters said they either \u201cstrongly support\u201d (40 percent) or \u201csomewhat support\u201d (41 percent) the Green New Deal, including 64 percent of Republicans (and even 57 percent of conservative Republicans).\nWhat else do Ocasio-Cortez, Warren, and Sanders have in common with each other \u2014 and with the voters? They want to soak the rich. Ocasio-Cortez suggested a 70 percent marginal tax rate on incomes above $10 million \u2014 condemned by \u201ccentrist\u201d Schultz as \u201cun-American\u201d but backed by a majority (51 percent) of Americans. Warren proposed a 2 percent wealth tax on assets above $50 million \u2014 slammed by \u201cmoderate\u201d Bloomberg as Venezuelan-style socialism, but supported by 61 percent of voters, including 51 percent of Republicans. (As my colleague Jon Schwarz has demonstrated, \u201cAmericans have never, in living memory, been averse to higher taxes on the rich.\u201d)\nHow about health care? The vast majority (70 percent) of voters, including a majority (52 percent) of Republicans, support a single-payer universal health care system, or Medicare for All. Six in 10 say it is \u201cthe responsibility of the federal government\u201d to ensure that all Americans have access to health care coverage.\nDebt-free and tuition-free college? A clear majority (60 percent) of the public, including a significant minority (41 percent) of Republicans, support free college \u201cfor those who meet income levels.\u201d\nA higher minimum wage? According to Pew, almost 6 in 10 (58 percent) Americans support increasing the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to (the Sanders-recommended) $15 an hour.\nGun control? About six out of 10 (61 percent) Americans back stricter laws on gun control, according to Gallup, \u201cthe highest percentage to favor tougher firearms laws in two or more decades.\u201d Almost all Americans (94 percent) back universal background checks on all gun sales \u2014 including almost three-quarters of National Rifle Association members.\nAbortion? Support for a legal right to abortion, according to a June 2018 poll by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, is at an \u201call-time high.\u201d Seven out of 10 Americans said they believed Roe v. Wade \u201cshould not be overturned,\u201d including a majority (52 percent) of Republicans.\nLegalizing marijuana? Two out of three Americans think marijuana should be made legal. According to a Gallup survey from October 2018, this marks \u201canother new high in Gallup\u2019s trend over nearly half a century.\u201d And here\u2019s the kicker: A majority (53 percent) of Republicans support legal marijuana too!\nMass incarceration? About nine out of 10 (91 percent) Americans say that the criminal justice system \u201chas problems that need fixing.\u201d About seven out of 10 (71 percent) say it is important \u201cto reduce the prison population in America,\u201d including a majority (52 percent) of Trump voters.\nImmigration? \u201cA record-high 75 percent of Americans,\u201d including 65 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, told Gallup in 2018 that immigration is a \u201cgood thing for the U.S.\u201d Six in 10 Americans oppose the construction of a wall on the southern border, while a massive 8 in 10 (81 percent) support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States.\nHow much of this polling, however, is reflected in the daily news coverage of the Democrats, which seeks to pit \u201cleftist\u201d activists against \u201ccentrist\u201d voters, and \u201cliberals\u201d against \u201cmoderates\u201d?\nHow is it that labels like \u201ccentrist\u201d and \u201cmoderate,\u201d which common sense tells us should reflect the views of a majority of Americans, have come to be applied to those who represent minority interests and opinions?\nHow many political reporters are willing to tell their readers or viewers what Stanford political scientist David Broockman told Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein in 2014: \u201cWhen we say moderate what we really mean is what corporations want. Within both parties there is this tension between what the politicians who get more corporate money and tend to be part of the establishment want \u2014 that\u2019s what we tend to call moderate \u2014 versus what the Tea Party and more liberal members want\u201d?\nThe center ground \u2014 if it even exists \u2014 cannot be found on a map; it is not a fixed geographical location. You cannot get in your car, type the address in your navigation, and then drive to it.\nIt moves, it shifts, it reacts to events. The center of 2019 is not the center of 1999 or even 2009. You want to know where it is right now? You want to find the moderate middle? Then ignore the right-wing hacks, the conventional wisdom-mongers, and the donor class. Go check out the policy platforms of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren.\nWait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn\u2019t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have?

Central to the approval process has been a top Staples lawyer who spent five years overseeing the very division that is now contemplating approval of the merger.</p>\n<p>A leading anti-corruption group is crying foul, pointing to a revolving-door practice in which agency officials often show up on the opposite side of the negotiating table, where they press their former colleagues to get mergers approved.</p>\n<p>Two recent cases involve mergers in the office supply and dialysis industries, and on Monday, Jeff Hauser of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research filed a <a href=\"http://cepr.net/publications/briefings/testimony/comment-by-jeff-hauser-to-ftc-on-proposed-consent-agreement-in-the-matter-of-staples-essendant-inc\">public comment</a> exposing that dynamic.</p>\n<p>Hauser&rsquo;s comment pertains to the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/staples-acquire-essendant-12-80-120000341.html\">proposed merger</a> between Staples and Essendant, the nation&rsquo;s largest office equipment wholesaler and one of only two major companies in that space. If the merger is approved, Staples, the main retail giant in the industry, would be in a position to potentially control price points for its retail competitors.</p>\n<p>On a party-line vote, the <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1448328/181_0180_staples_essendant_majority_statement_1-28-19.pdf\">FTC agreed</a> to this unholy alliance, <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/1810180_staples_essendant_agreement_1-28-19.pdf\">reaching a settlement</a> that puts alleged &ldquo;firewalls&rdquo; in place to separate information about Essendant&rsquo;s retail clients from those making Staples pricing decisions. Staples presumably wouldn&rsquo;t need access to that information to simply make Essendant&rsquo;s prices higher (or its own prices lower) to drive market share away from rivals, among <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1448321/181_0180_staples_essendant_slaughter_statement.pdf\">numerous other options</a>. The settlement agreement provisionally agreed to by the FTC is subject to public comment and then a final approval.</p>\n<p>In his <a href=\"http://cepr.net/publications/briefings/testimony/comment-by-jeff-hauser-to-ftc-on-proposed-consent-agreement-in-the-matter-of-staples-essendant-inc\">letter</a>, Hauser floats a hypothesis for why the FTC gave the go-ahead: The legal counsel for Staples&rsquo;s parent company was, until 2012, the leader of the FTC division that negotiated the settlement, where he worked with some of the agency lawyers now dealing with the Staples case.</p>\n<p>The lead counsel for Sycamore Partners, the private equity firm that owns Staples, is Matthew J. Reilly of the white-shoe D.C. law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis. As his <a href=\"https://www.kirkland.com/lawyers/r/reilly-matthew-j-pc\">bio</a> indicates, Reilly &ldquo;served for five years as the head of the FTC&rsquo;s Mergers IV division.&rdquo; The Mergers IV Division of the FTC&rsquo;s Bureau of Competition happens to be the section that <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/1810180_staples_essendant_agreement_1-28-19.pdf\">handled the Staples-Essendant case</a>.</p>\n<blockquote data-reactid=\"220\">&ldquo;The potential for Reilly&rsquo;s prior relationships with members of the Mergers IV division to have helped secure the deal&rsquo;s approval irreparably undermines public confidence in this merger&rsquo;s merits.&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<p>Two of the career FTC attorneys involved in the Staples case &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggie-dimoscato-b6b4953/\">Maria DiMoscato</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-hahm-7aa63/\">Kevin Hahm</a> &mdash; previously worked on cases in which Reilly was a lead attorney. Hauser speculated that, as head of the division, Reilly had promotion or bonus authority over these more junior attorneys. &ldquo;The potential for Reilly&rsquo;s prior relationships with members of the Mergers IV division to have helped secure the deal&rsquo;s approval irreparably undermines public confidence in this merger&rsquo;s merits,&rdquo; Hauser wrote in his comment letter to the FTC.</p>\n<p>Due to this conflict of interest, the Revolving Door Project wants the FTC to withdraw its approval for the Staples-Essendant merger. The Washington-based watchdog group also wants new rules prohibiting a former attorney from representing clients in a merger inquiry before a division in which the attorney once held a leadership role.</p>\n<p>This would renew public trust in the agency as &ldquo;serving the public interest, rather than the interests of the regulated,&rdquo; Hauser writes. But it would really screw up Kirkland &amp; Ellis&rsquo;s marketing of Reilly as a bulldozer prying open the doors of the FTC.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Matt is frequently relied upon to obtain regulatory clearance for many of the toughest, high profile deals,&rdquo; according to his law firm bio. TheNational Law Journal <a href=\"https://www.kirkland.com/news/press-release/2016/10/kirkland--ellis-boosts-antitrust-and-competition-p\">gave Reilly the honor</a> of one of America&rsquo;s top outside counsels, specifically &ldquo;for his success in obtaining US merger clearances,&rdquo; Kirkland &amp; Ellis notes. He has experience in this field, too, having represented Office Depot when it was <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131105006961/en/Office-Depot-OfficeMax-Complete-Merger\">approved to purchase OfficeMax</a> in 2013.</p>\n<p>In other words, Reilly&rsquo;s past service at the FTC is precisely how he makes his money working for corporate clients. He needs to shuttle between the government and the private sector to build the relationships necessary to serve his clients&rsquo; goals of concentrating corporate power.</p>\n<p>Through a spokesperson, Sycamore Partners declined to comment. Reilly did not respond to a request for comment, and neither did the FTC.</p>\n<p>The FTC is <a href=\"https://ftcpublic.commentworks.com/ftc/staplesessendantconsent/\">taking public comment</a> on the proposed settlement for the Staples-Essendant merger until Wednesday, February 27. The commission will then make a final decision on the merger within a couple months.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of comments <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/public-comments/2019/02/initiative-797?page=2\">have been filed</a> opposing the merger, which is unusually large for an FTC comment period. Grassroots groups like Demand Progress have been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/demandprogress/status/1100142866058235904\">organizing opposition</a> to the merger, with an emphasis on preventing another <a href=\"http://cepr.net/publications/briefings/testimony/comment-to-ftc-by-eileen-appelbaum-on-proposed-consent-agreement-in-the-matter-of-staples-essendant-inc\">private equity retail disaster</a>, in which Staples builds unsustainable debt as it grows through acquisition.</p>\n<p><u>A similar revolving-door</u> situation can be seen in another <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-requires-fresenius-medical-care-ag-kgaa-nxstage-medical-inc\">approved vertical merger</a>, between dialysis giant Fresenius and NxStage Medical, makers of an in-home dialysis machine. Fresenius is one of two leading dialysis companies, and <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1455733/171_0227_fresenius_nxstage_chopra_statement_2-19-19.pdf\">critics charge</a> that the deal could prohibit competitors from making more patient-friendly devices and potentially limit uptake of in-home use.</p>\n<p>In this case, NxStage Medical went beyond merely hiring the head of the specific division of the FTC&rsquo;s Bureau of Competition analyzing the merger: It <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/1710227_fresenius-nxstage_agreement.pdf\">hired Deborah Feinstein</a>, the former head of the entire bureau.</p>\n<p>Feinstein&rsquo;s case exemplifies just how fluid the door between the private and public spheres is. She has shuttled between the Bureau of Competition and top antitrust law firm Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer three times in the past 30 years. At the FTC, she was <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/12/16/why-are-drug-monopolies-running-amok-meet-deborah-feinstein/\">notorious for waving through mergers</a> in pharmaceuticals and other industries; in a <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_statements/significance-consent-orders-federal-trade-commission%E2%80%99s-competition-enforcement-efforts-gcr-live/130917gcrspeech.pdf\">2013 speech</a>, Feinstein openly argued in favor of settlements that allow companies to merge as &ldquo;a remedy that is as good as or better than what could be achieved from litigation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Now back at Arnold &amp; Porter, Feinstein represents companies in the same settlement negotiations that she championed while at the FTC.</p>\n<p>Feinstein did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>This corrosive back-and-forth between positions of power at the antitrust agencies and firms that represent clients before those agencies is widespread. Joseph Simons, the current chair of the FTC, <a href=\"https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/02/02/joseph-simons-of-paul-weiss-trumps-ftc-chair-pick-reports-1-9m-in-partner-share/?slreturn=20181111122527\">worked on corporate mergers</a> at the law office of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison. Christine Wilson, a Republican commissioner, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftc-nominee-christine-wilson-discloses-084914363.html\">worked at Kirkland &amp; Ellis</a>, Matthew Reilly&rsquo;s firm, representing clients like Northwest Airlines in its merger with Delta, and later as Delta&rsquo;s in-house counsel.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is not Nigerian corruption where suitcases of cash are handed over or money is transferred to Swiss Banks,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/why-the-regulators-went-soft-on-monopolies/\">writes</a> Jonathan Tepper, co-author of &ldquo;The Myth of Capitalism.&rdquo; &ldquo;The revolving door creates a culture of ideological capture and what Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls the &lsquo;retrospective bribe.&rsquo; It encourages poachers turned gamekeepers turned poachers to look after their clients&rsquo; interests in the long term.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The antitrust group of Arnold &amp; Porter, Feinstein&rsquo;s firm, has a particular pipeline into government service. Lawyers from the group<a href=\"http://www.arnoldporter.com/practices.cfm?u=AntitrustCompetition&action=view&id=275\"> have moved on to positions</a> like FTC chair, general counsel, and director of the Bureau of Competition, as well as head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Antitrust Division. Former Antitrust Division chief William Baer had<a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/william-baer-confirmed-as-justice-department-antitrust-chief/\"> two stints at the FTC</a> in between his tenure at Arnold &amp; Porter. Former chair of the FTC<a href=\"http://www.arnoldporter.com/professionals.cfm?action=view&id=424\"> Robert Pitofsky</a> also went back-and-forth between the agency and Arnold &amp; Porter.</p>\n<p>The true irony is that one of the co-founders of Arnold &amp; Porter was <a href=\"https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/about/history\">Thurman Arnold</a>, the head of the Antitrust Division under President Franklin D. Roosevelt and perhaps the most aggressive antitrust enforcer in history. He might not be thrilled about what&rsquo;s being done in his name.</p>\n<p>Wait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn&rsquo;t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren&rsquo;t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don&rsquo;t have ads, so we depend on our members &mdash; 35,000 and counting &mdash; to help us hold the powerful to account.

Central to the approval process has been a top Staples lawyer who spent five years overseeing the very division that is now contemplating approval of the merger.\nA leading anti-corruption group is crying foul, pointing to a revolving-door practice in which agency officials often show up on the opposite side of the negotiating table, where they press their former colleagues to get mergers approved.\nTwo recent cases involve mergers in the office supply and dialysis industries, and on Monday, Jeff Hauser of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research filed a public comment exposing that dynamic.\nHauser\u2019s comment pertains to the proposed merger between Staples and Essendant, the nation\u2019s largest office equipment wholesaler and one of only two major companies in that space. If the merger is approved, Staples, the main retail giant in the industry, would be in a position to potentially control price points for its retail competitors.\nOn a party-line vote, the FTC agreed to this unholy alliance, reaching a settlement that puts alleged \u201cfirewalls\u201d in place to separate information about Essendant\u2019s retail clients from those making Staples pricing decisions. Staples presumably wouldn\u2019t need access to that information to simply make Essendant\u2019s prices higher (or its own prices lower) to drive market share away from rivals, among numerous other options. The settlement agreement provisionally agreed to by the FTC is subject to public comment and then a final approval.\nIn his letter, Hauser floats a hypothesis for why the FTC gave the go-ahead: The legal counsel for Staples\u2019s parent company was, until 2012, the leader of the FTC division that negotiated the settlement, where he worked with some of the agency lawyers now dealing with the Staples case.\nThe lead counsel for Sycamore Partners, the private equity firm that owns Staples, is Matthew J.

Hauser speculated that, as head of the division, Reilly had promotion or bonus authority over these more junior attorneys. \u201cThe potential for Reilly\u2019s prior relationships with members of the Mergers IV division to have helped secure the deal\u2019s approval irreparably undermines public confidence in this merger\u2019s merits,\u201d Hauser wrote in his comment letter to the FTC.\nDue to this conflict of interest, the Revolving Door Project wants the FTC to withdraw its approval for the Staples-Essendant merger. The Washington-based watchdog group also wants new rules prohibiting a former attorney from representing clients in a merger inquiry before a division in which the attorney once held a leadership role.\nThis would renew public trust in the agency as \u201cserving the public interest, rather than the interests of the regulated,\u201d Hauser writes. But it would really screw up Kirkland & Ellis\u2019s marketing of Reilly as a bulldozer prying open the doors of the FTC.\n\u201cMatt is frequently relied upon to obtain regulatory clearance for many of the toughest, high profile deals,\u201d according to his law firm bio. TheNational Law Journal gave Reilly the honor of one of America\u2019s top outside counsels, specifically \u201cfor his success in obtaining US merger clearances,\u201d Kirkland & Ellis notes. He has experience in this field, too, having represented Office Depot when it was approved to purchase OfficeMax in 2013.\nIn other words, Reilly\u2019s past service at the FTC is precisely how he makes his money working for corporate clients. He needs to shuttle between the government and the private sector to build the relationships necessary to serve his clients\u2019 goals of concentrating corporate power.\nThrough a spokesperson, Sycamore Partners declined to comment. Reilly did not respond to a request for comment, and neither did the FTC.\nThe FTC is taking public comment on the proposed settlement for the Staples-Essendant merger until Wednesday, February 27. The commission will then make a final decision on the merger within a couple months.\nHundreds of comments have been filed opposing the merger, which is unusually large for an FTC comment period. Grassroots groups like Demand Progress have been organizing opposition to the merger, with an emphasis on preventing another private equity retail disaster, in which Staples builds unsustainable debt as it grows through acquisition.\nA similar revolving-door situation can be seen in another approved vertical merger, between dialysis giant Fresenius and NxStage Medical, makers of an in-home dialysis machine. Fresenius is one of two leading dialysis companies, and critics charge that the deal could prohibit competitors from making more patient-friendly devices and potentially limit uptake of in-home use.\nIn this case, NxStage Medical went beyond merely hiring the head of the specific division of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition analyzing the merger: It hired Deborah Feinstein, the former head of the entire bureau.\nFeinstein\u2019s case exemplifies just how fluid the door between the private and public spheres is. She has shuttled between the Bureau of Competition and top antitrust law firm Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer three times in the past 30 years. At the FTC, she was notorious for waving through mergers in pharmaceuticals and other industries; in a 2013 speech, Feinstein openly argued in favor of settlements that allow companies to merge as \u201ca remedy that is as good as or better than what could be achieved from litigation.\u201d\nNow back at Arnold & Porter, Feinstein represents companies in the same settlement negotiations that she championed while at the FTC.\nFeinstein did not respond to a request for comment.\nThis corrosive back-and-forth between positions of power at the antitrust agencies and firms that represent clients before those agencies is widespread. Joseph Simons, the current chair of the FTC, worked on corporate mergers at the law office of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Christine Wilson, a Republican commissioner, worked at Kirkland & Ellis, Matthew Reilly\u2019s firm, representing clients like Northwest Airlines in its merger with Delta, and later as Delta\u2019s in-house counsel.\n\u201cThis is not Nigerian corruption where suitcases of cash are handed over or money is transferred to Swiss Banks,\u201d writes Jonathan Tepper, co-author of \u201cThe Myth of Capitalism.\u201d \u201cThe revolving door creates a culture of ideological capture and what Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls the \u2018retrospective bribe.\u2019 It encourages poachers turned gamekeepers turned poachers to look after their clients\u2019 interests in the long term.\u201d\nThe antitrust group of Arnold & Porter, Feinstein\u2019s firm, has a particular pipeline into government service. Lawyers from the group have moved on to positions like FTC chair, general counsel, and director of the Bureau of Competition, as well as head of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division. Former Antitrust Division chief William Baer had two stints at the FTC in between his tenure at Arnold & Porter. Former chair of the FTC Robert Pitofsky also went back-and-forth between the agency and Arnold & Porter.\nThe true irony is that one of the co-founders of Arnold & Porter was Thurman Arnold, the head of the Antitrust Division under President Franklin D. Roosevelt and perhaps the most aggressive antitrust enforcer in history. He might not be thrilled about what\u2019s being done in his name.\nWait!

Bernie Sanders waves as he takes the stage at the Our Revolution Massachusetts Rally in Boston, Mass., on March 31, 2017.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Photo: Scott Eisen/Getty Images</p>\n<p><u>After Sens. Kamala Harris</u> and Cory Booker were asked about reparations for slavery in <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/20/2020-candidates-reparations/\">a Breakfast Club interview last week</a>, the issue quickly became hot on the 2020 campaign trail, with candidates Elizabeth Warren and Juli&aacute;n Castro quickly voicing their support for the policy. Last night, the reparations question surfaced again when Sen. Bernie Sanders was asked for his position during a CNN Town Hall hosted by Wolf Blitzer.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There are massive disparities that must be addressed,&rdquo; Sanders answered. &ldquo;There is legislation that I like introduced by Congressman Jim Clyburn &mdash; it&rsquo;s called the 10/20/30 legislation &mdash; which focuses federal resources in a very significant way on distressed communities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He went on: &ldquo;I think we have to do everything that we can to end institutional racism in this country. It is not acceptable to me that the rate of childhood poverty among the African-American community is over 30 percent in this country &mdash; that is beyond belief &mdash; that African-Americans die from cancer at higher rates than whites. So we&rsquo;re going to do everything we can to put resources into distressed communities and improve lives for those people who have been hurt by the legacy of slavery.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sanders&rsquo;s response was broadly similar to the other candidates who support reparations. Unlike in 2016, when Sanders joined Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in <i>not</i> supporting reparations, the Vermont senator was careful not to appear dismissive of the underlying right to recompense. Like Sens. Cory Booker, Harris, and Warren, he acknowledged racial disparities resulting from &ldquo;the legacy of slavery&rdquo; and the need to address them. Unlike any other 2020 candidate, he went on to offer his support for specific legislation, which would address racial disparities: the Clyburn/Booker 10/20/30 aimed at attacking persistent poverty.</p>\n<p>Blitzer posed a follow-up question demanding an up-or-down answer: &ldquo;So what is your position specifically on reparations?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At this point, Sanders asked a crucial, as yet unasked question: &ldquo;What does that mean? What do they mean? I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s been very clear.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And he&rsquo;s right.</p>\n<p>Up until now, no one&rsquo;s bothered to define reparations in the context of 2020 vetting. And the discourse has suffered for it.</p>\n<blockquote data-reactid=\"203\">Up until now, no one&rsquo;s bothered to define reparations in the context of 2020 vetting. And the discourse has suffered for it.</blockquote>\n<p>Like Harris and Booker before them, Warren and Castro&rsquo;s support for reparations amounts to a support for a principle, but not a policy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Black families have had a much steeper hill to climb, we need systematic structural changes to address that,&rdquo; Warren has said.</p>\n<p>Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, offered: &ldquo;I have long thought that this country would be better off if we did find a way to do that &mdash; reparations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The &ldquo;structural changes&rdquo; Warren evokes aren&rsquo;t necessarily racially specific. And Castro&rsquo;s statement that we&rsquo;d be &ldquo;better off&rdquo; with reparations manages to dodge the question of whether he supports reparations as a political matter entirely. &ldquo;This is not something that I see through a political lens,&rdquo; he said, before proposing a &ldquo;task force&rdquo; to look into the issue.</p>\n<p>Although Harris has said she supports &ldquo;some kind of reparations,&rdquo; the examples she&rsquo;s pointed to, like her <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/19/17995374/kamala-harris-lift-act-basic-income-cash-eitc\">LIFT tax cuts</a>, aren&rsquo;t race-specific, though they would disproportionately help black Americans. Booker similarly hasn&rsquo;t proposed race-targeted programs, pointing instead to his baby bonds plan, criminal justice reform, and other anti-poverty programs.</p>\n<p>Because they&rsquo;ve not been pressed for details, the candidates have been able to voice &ldquo;support&rdquo; for reparations without committing to any particular policy or goals. But while the press may not appreciate the difference between symbolic posturing and genuine policy commitments, many black Americans have.</p>\n<p><u>&ldquo;What</u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris\"> @KamalaHarris</a> is proposing is a CLASS SPECIFIC piece of legislation,&rdquo; tweeted Yvette Carnell, founder of the #ADOS movement, which advocates for the interests of American descendants of slavery. &ldquo;Reparations for<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ADOS?src=hash\"> #ADOS</a> is a RACE SPECIFIC piece of legislation. America inflicted race specific harm that requires race specific redress. Stop trying to lie to us. We&rsquo;re not stupid.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Carnell&rsquo;s tweet followed an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsB6EWNUcyY\">interview</a> in which Grio reporter Natasha Alford asked Harris a critical follow-up question after the California senator evoked race-neutral programs like her LIFT Act in response to an inquiry about reparations: &ldquo;So by default, it affects black families, but there&rsquo;s not a particular policy for African-Americans that you&rsquo;ve explored?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Harris&rsquo;s answer, after a lengthy preamble, was no: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to sit here and say I&rsquo;m going to do something that only benefits black people. No! Because whatever benefits black people will benefit society as a whole and the country, right?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Harris couldn&rsquo;t have been more clear about <i>not</i> supporting a race-specific reparations program. Yet the press has generally covered all of these answers on the question of reparations as yeses.</p>\n<p>Astead Herndon at the New York Times has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/us/politics/2020-democrats-race-policy.html\">reported</a> that Warren, Castro, and Harris &ldquo;supported reparations,&rdquo; though he acknowledged that Warren&rsquo;s campaign &rdquo;declined to give further details on that backing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The no&rsquo;s, too, have been described inconsistently. In the space of one article, Herndon characterized Sanders as having &ldquo;dismissed&rdquo; reparations as impractical in 2016, while writing that Clinton had merely &ldquo;declined to support&rdquo; reparations that year. It would be more accurate to say that she <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/26/bernie-s/reparations-for-slavery-sanders-obama-clinton/\">dodged</a> answering the question directly.</p>\n<p>And while neither Sanders, Clinton, nor Barack Obama answered yes on the question of reparations, Herndon characterized Obama&rsquo;s response more gently, writing: &ldquo;The first black president was seen in some political quarters as reticent about prioritizing the interests of black voters, and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/ta-nehisi-coates-obama-transcript-ii/511133/\">he called the idea of reparations impractical</a> in 2016.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth asking who benefits from this inconsistent coverage and empty political posturing.</p>\n<p><u>Consider the effect</u> of Obama&rsquo;s rationalization against reparations, which has gone largely unscrutinized.</p>\n<p>In a 2016 <a href=\"https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/164713\">interview</a> with Ta-Nehisi Coates, Obama argued that &ldquo;as a practical matter, it is hard to think of any society in human history in which a majority population has said that as a consequence of historic wrongs, we are now going to take a big chunk of the nation&rsquo;s resources over a long period of time to make that right.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s not true. As Obama went on to acknowledge, Jews received reparations from Germany following the Holocaust, and Japanese-Americans received reparations after internment during World War II. Obama attempted to distinguish black Americans from other groups, adopting the right-wing argument that reparations were politically impractical because too much time had passed for black Americans to collect on the debts of slavery. According to Obama, Holocaust survivors and their children &mdash; only one or two generations removed from the genocide &mdash; could say &ldquo;that was my house. Those were my paintings. Those were my mother&rsquo;s family jewels&rdquo; in a way that black Americans could not.</p>\n<p>But the passage of time has never been more than a pretext used to justify not paying what America had promised it would: the now proverbial 40 acres and a mule.</p>\n<blockquote data-reactid=\"207\">The passage of time has never been more than a pretext used to justify not paying what America had promised it would: the now proverbial 40 acres and a mule.</blockquote>\n<p>The question of reparations has been raised continuously since <i>before</i> the end of the Civil War &mdash; including by President Abraham Lincoln who <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/black-reparations/\">seriously considered the issue</a> &mdash; not for slaves, but for slaveholders who felt they should be compensated for their lost &ldquo;property.&rdquo; Indeed, an entire movement of slavery opponents pushed for years to simply buy out the slave population to avoid war. And throughout the 20th century &mdash; including in the 1960s, when those born into slavery were in their 90s, and many millions more of their immediate descendants still lived &mdash; requests for reparations were continually ignored. Over the years, the excuse that &ldquo;too much time has passed&rdquo; increasingly came to be rooted in reality. But only because it was a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>\n<p>Obama, a lawyer, should know better than to argue that the statute of limitations on reparations had lapsed when a timely claim had been made. But in truth, there <i>are</i> now legitimate (but not insurmountable) logistical concerns to administering a race-specific plan. How do you account for people who are only partially descended from American slaves? What about those who can&rsquo;t prove their lineage? What about families who immigrated early enough to experience Jim Crow, but after slavery? Is the most politically viable way to deliver material benefits to black Americans via intersectionally designed universal programs?</p>\n<p>These questions are crucial to anyone serious about pursuing reparations. And, it could be argued, they&rsquo;re the questions that a genuine supporter of reparations wants to explore. But none of them were ever put to Obama, Clinton, or Sanders in 2016. The assumptions put forward by Obama and others were never challenged. And none of these foundational questions were raised at last night&rsquo;s town hall. It&rsquo;s almost as if the interest in reparations was only symbolic. Or political.</p>\n<blockquote data-reactid=\"211\">By asking Blitzer to define what reparations actually means, Sanders shifted the conversation from speculative rhetoric to practical policy.</blockquote>\n<p>As I <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/20/2020-candidates-reparations/\">argued</a> last week, the void left by a lack of serious political conversations about reparations has created opportunities for politicians to use reparations as political brinkmanship, a way to effect commitment to black Americans without committing to anything beyond lip service.</p>\n<p>But by asking Blitzer to define what reparations actually means, Sanders shifted the conversation from speculative rhetoric to practical policy and in doing so, made it more likely that the <i>goals</i> of reparations will be pursued in good faith. He forced everyone to show their hand.</p>\n<p><u>Importantly, there is</u> currently no consensus on what reparations would look like. Coates famously wrote over 15,000 words making a powerful case for reparations, but even he failed to come to a firm conclusion about what we should do next.</p>\n<p>When I spoke to Duke University professor Sandy Darity last week, an authority on the subject of reparations, he emphasized that a full-scale attack on the racial wealth gap will require a racially targeted project on the order of a large-scale reparations program. But he also acknowledged that universal programs of the type now on the table can reduce racial wealth inequality.</p>\n<p>Darity has specifically championed Booker&rsquo;s baby bonds program as the class-based plan best positioned to close the racial wealth gap. But he was also clear that the program is flawed insofar as it&rsquo;s pegged to parental income &mdash; not wealth, where the biggest racial disparity lies. (The original baby bonds program he designed with Ohio State economist Darrick Hamilton was keyed to wealth. But Darity says that Booker chose to base his plan on income because of &ldquo;convenience.&rdquo; When I pointed out that millions of parents calculate their wealth to apply for federal student aid for their college-bound kids every year, Darity agreed that it wasn&rsquo;t as easy, but it was doable).</p>\n<p>The point is that universal programs are not a substitute for racially targeted interventions. But &ldquo;the ideal world,&rdquo; he says, is one in which you&rsquo;d combine approaches that target wealth: prioritize giving more resources to the poor while also closing the gap by taxing the rich.</p>\n<p>To ensure that the ostensible goals of black Americans are met, it&rsquo;s important not to lose sight of the fact that equality will require a multipronged approach.</p>\n<p><u>All the 2020</u> candidates can be faulted for not turning attention to the question of reparations until campaign season. But it feels strange to demand that candidates throw their unqualified support behind something that no one can yet define.</p>\n<p>The preliminary questions journalists should ask instead of &ldquo;do you support reparations?&rdquo; are these: 1) Will you commit to meaningfully researching and developing a plan for reparations, and 2) If and when you develop a policy, will you commit to implementing it?</p>\n<p>I suspect most candidates would have a much easier time answering &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to this formulation, and rightly so. At this point, every candidate who has opined has done a solid job of articulating the <i>why</i> of reparations: slavery, Jim Crow, disparities. Now the question worth asking is the <i>how</i>.</p>\n<p>Ironically, as long as the question of reparations remains vague, it&rsquo;s more likely to be controversial. Undefined, reparations can take the form of the public&rsquo;s worst fears: a free &ldquo;check&rdquo; to the &ldquo;undeserving&rdquo; black masses (which, who knows, might be the best option), versus tuition or housing grants that mimic those New Deal programs from which blacks were historically excluded. Both black and white legislators have shied away from the question of reparations, treating it as a political hot potato &mdash; hiding behind the idea that reparations are just too complicated to administer. Nailing down an actual plan destroys that rationale. Vagueness is a gift to the non-committal.</p>\n<p>Wait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn&rsquo;t done it?

                "text": "Photo: Scott Eisen/Getty Images\nAfter Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker were asked about reparations for slavery in a Breakfast Club interview last week, the issue quickly became hot on the 2020 campaign trail, with candidates Elizabeth Warren and Juli\u00e1n Castro quickly voicing their support for the policy. Last night, the reparations question surfaced again when Sen. Bernie Sanders was asked for his position during a CNN Town Hall hosted by Wolf Blitzer.\n\u201cThere are massive disparities that must be addressed,\u201d Sanders answered. \u201cThere is legislation that I like introduced by Congressman Jim Clyburn \u2014 it\u2019s called the 10/20/30 legislation \u2014 which focuses federal resources in a very significant way on distressed communities.\u201d\nHe went on: \u201cI think we have to do everything that we can to end institutional racism in this country. It is not acceptable to me that the rate of childhood poverty among the African-American community is over 30 percent in this country \u2014 that is beyond belief \u2014 that African-Americans die from cancer at higher rates than whites. So we\u2019re going to do everything we can to put resources into distressed communities and improve lives for those people who have been hurt by the legacy of slavery.\u201d\nSanders\u2019s response was broadly similar to the other candidates who support reparations. Unlike in 2016, when Sanders joined Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in not supporting reparations, the Vermont senator was careful not to appear dismissive of the underlying right to recompense. Like Sens. Cory Booker, Harris, and Warren, he acknowledged racial disparities resulting from \u201cthe legacy of slavery\u201d and the need to address them. Unlike any other 2020 candidate, he went on to offer his support for specific legislation, which would address racial disparities: the Clyburn/Booker 10/20/30 aimed at attacking persistent poverty.\nBlitzer posed a follow-up question demanding an up-or-down answer: \u201cSo what is your position specifically on reparations?\u201d\nAt this point, Sanders asked a crucial, as yet unasked question: \u201cWhat does that mean? What do they mean? I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s been very clear.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s right.\nUp until now, no one\u2019s bothered to define reparations in the context of 2020 vetting. And the discourse has suffered for it.\nUp until now, no one\u2019s bothered to define reparations in the context of 2020 vetting. And the discourse has suffered for it.\nLike Harris and Booker before them, Warren and Castro\u2019s support for reparations amounts to a support for a principle, but not a policy.\n\u201cBlack families have had a much steeper hill to climb, we need systematic structural changes to address that,\u201d Warren has said.\nCastro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, offered: \u201cI have long thought that this country would be better off if we did find a way to do that \u2014 reparations.\u201d\nThe \u201cstructural changes\u201d Warren evokes aren\u2019t necessarily racially specific. And Castro\u2019s statement that we\u2019d be \u201cbetter off\u201d with reparations manages to dodge the question of whether he supports reparations as a political matter entirely. \u201cThis is not something that I see through a political lens,\u201d he said, before proposing a \u201ctask force\u201d to look into the issue.\nAlthough Harris has said she supports \u201csome kind of reparations,\u201d the examples she\u2019s pointed to, like her LIFT tax cuts, aren\u2019t race-specific, though they would disproportionately help black Americans. Booker similarly hasn\u2019t proposed race-targeted programs, pointing instead to his baby bonds plan, criminal justice reform, and other anti-poverty programs.\nBecause they\u2019ve not been pressed for details, the candidates have been able to voice \u201csupport\u201d for reparations without committing to any particular policy or goals. But while the press may not appreciate the difference between symbolic posturing and genuine policy commitments, many black Americans have.\n\u201cWhat @KamalaHarris is proposing is a CLASS SPECIFIC piece of legislation,\u201d tweeted Yvette Carnell, founder of the #ADOS movement, which advocates for the interests of American descendants of slavery. \u201cReparations for #ADOS is a RACE SPECIFIC piece of legislation. America inflicted race specific harm that requires race specific redress. Stop trying to lie to us. We\u2019re not stupid.\u201d\nCarnell\u2019s tweet followed an interview in which Grio reporter Natasha Alford asked Harris a critical follow-up question after the California senator evoked race-neutral programs like her LIFT Act in response to an inquiry about reparations: \u201cSo by default, it affects black families, but there\u2019s not a particular policy for African-Americans that you\u2019ve explored?\u201d\nHarris\u2019s answer, after a lengthy preamble, was no: \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say I\u2019m going to do something that only benefits black people. No! Because whatever benefits black people will benefit society as a whole and the country, right?\u201d\nHarris couldn\u2019t have been more clear about not supporting a race-specific reparations program. Yet the press has generally covered all of these answers on the question of reparations as yeses.\nAstead Herndon at the New York Times has reported that Warren, Castro, and Harris \u201csupported reparations,\u201d though he acknowledged that Warren\u2019s campaign \u201ddeclined to give further details on that backing.\u201d\nThe no\u2019s, too, have been described inconsistently. In the space of one article, Herndon characterized Sanders as having \u201cdismissed\u201d reparations as impractical in 2016, while writing that Clinton had merely \u201cdeclined to support\u201d reparations that year. It would be more accurate to say that she dodged answering the question directly.\nAnd while neither Sanders, Clinton, nor Barack Obama answered yes on the question of reparations, Herndon characterized Obama\u2019s response more gently, writing: \u201cThe first black president was seen in some political quarters as reticent about prioritizing the interests of black voters, and he called the idea of reparations impractical in 2016.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth asking who benefits from this inconsistent coverage and empty political posturing.\nConsider the effect of Obama\u2019s rationalization against reparations, which has gone largely unscrutinized.\nIn a 2016 interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates, Obama argued that \u201cas a practical matter, it is hard to think of any society in human history in which a majority population has said that as a consequence of historic wrongs, we are now going to take a big chunk of the nation\u2019s resources over a long period of time to make that right.\u201d\nOf course, that\u2019s not true. As Obama went on to acknowledge, Jews received reparations from Germany following the Holocaust, and Japanese-Americans received reparations after internment during World War II. Obama attempted to distinguish black Americans from other groups, adopting the right-wing argument that reparations were politically impractical because too much time had passed for black Americans to collect on the debts of slavery. According to Obama, Holocaust survivors and their children \u2014 only one or two generations removed from the genocide \u2014 could say \u201cthat was my house. Those were my paintings. Those were my mother\u2019s family jewels\u201d in a way that black Americans could not.\nBut the passage of time has never been more than a pretext used to justify not paying what America had promised it would: the now proverbial 40 acres and a mule.\nThe passage of time has never been more than a pretext used to justify not paying what America had promised it would: the now proverbial 40 acres and a mule.\nThe question of reparations has been raised continuously since before the end of the Civil War \u2014 including by President Abraham Lincoln who seriously considered the issue \u2014 not for slaves, but for slaveholders who felt they should be compensated for their lost \u201cproperty.\u201d Indeed, an entire movement of slavery opponents pushed for years to simply buy out the slave population to avoid war. And throughout the 20th century \u2014 including in the 1960s, when those born into slavery were in their 90s, and many millions more of their immediate descendants still lived \u2014 requests for reparations were continually ignored. Over the years, the excuse that \u201ctoo much time has passed\u201d increasingly came to be rooted in reality. But only because it was a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nObama, a lawyer, should know better than to argue that the statute of limitations on reparations had lapsed when a timely claim had been made. But in truth, there are now legitimate (but not insurmountable) logistical concerns to administering a race-specific plan. How do you account for people who are only partially descended from American slaves? What about those who can\u2019t prove their lineage? What about families who immigrated early enough to experience Jim Crow, but after slavery? Is the most politically viable way to deliver material benefits to black Americans via intersectionally designed universal programs?\nThese questions are crucial to anyone serious about pursuing reparations. And, it could be argued, they\u2019re the questions that a genuine supporter of reparations wants to explore. But none of them were ever put to Obama, Clinton, or Sanders in 2016. The assumptions put forward by Obama and others were never challenged. And none of these foundational questions were raised at last night\u2019s town hall. It\u2019s almost as if the interest in reparations was only symbolic. Or political.\nBy asking Blitzer to define what reparations actually means, Sanders shifted the conversation from speculative rhetoric to practical policy.\nAs I argued last week, the void left by a lack of serious political conversations about reparations has created opportunities for politicians to use reparations as political brinkmanship, a way to effect commitment to black Americans without committing to anything beyond lip service.\nBut by asking Blitzer to define what reparations actually means, Sanders shifted the conversation from speculative rhetoric to practical policy and in doing so, made it more likely that the goals of reparations will be pursued in good faith. He forced everyone to show their hand.\nImportantly, there is currently no consensus on what reparations would look like. Coates famously wrote over 15,000 words making a powerful case for reparations, but even he failed to come to a firm conclusion about what we should do next.\nWhen I spoke to Duke University professor Sandy Darity last week, an authority on the subject of reparations, he emphasized that a full-scale attack on the racial wealth gap will require a racially targeted project on the order of a large-scale reparations program. But he also acknowledged that universal programs of the type now on the table can reduce racial wealth inequality.\nDarity has specifically championed Booker\u2019s baby bonds program as the class-based plan best positioned to close the racial wealth gap. But he was also clear that the program is flawed insofar as it\u2019s pegged to parental income \u2014 not wealth, where the biggest racial disparity lies. (The original baby bonds program he designed with Ohio State economist Darrick Hamilton was keyed to wealth. But Darity says that Booker chose to base his plan on income because of \u201cconvenience.\u201d When I pointed out that millions of parents calculate their wealth to apply for federal student aid for their college-bound kids every year, Darity agreed that it wasn\u2019t as easy, but it was doable).\nThe point is that universal programs are not a substitute for racially targeted interventions. But \u201cthe ideal world,\u201d he says, is one in which you\u2019d combine approaches that target wealth: prioritize giving more resources to the poor while also closing the gap by taxing the rich.\nTo ensure that the ostensible goals of black Americans are met, it\u2019s important not to lose sight of the fact that equality will require a multipronged approach.\nAll the 2020 candidates can be faulted for not turning attention to the question of reparations until campaign season. But it feels strange to demand that candidates throw their unqualified support behind something that no one can yet define.\nThe preliminary questions journalists should ask instead of \u201cdo you support reparations?\u201d are these: 1) Will you commit to meaningfully researching and developing a plan for reparations, and 2) If and when you develop a policy, will you commit to implementing it?\nI suspect most candidates would have a much easier time answering \u201cyes\u201d to this formulation, and rightly so. At this point, every candidate who has opined has done a solid job of articulating the why of reparations: slavery, Jim Crow, disparities. Now the question worth asking is the how.\nIronically, as long as the question of reparations remains vague, it\u2019s more likely to be controversial. Undefined, reparations can take the form of the public\u2019s worst fears: a free \u201ccheck\u201d to the \u201cundeserving\u201d black masses (which, who knows, might be the best option), versus tuition or housing grants that mimic those New Deal programs from which blacks were historically excluded. Both black and white legislators have shied away from the question of reparations, treating it as a political hot potato \u2014 hiding behind the idea that reparations are just too complicated to administer. Nailing down an actual plan destroys that rationale. Vagueness is a gift to the non-committal.\nWait!

Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren\u2019t on the beat?

Beto O&rsquo;Rourke told a television station in his native El Paso that he is joining the race for president, and released a video announcement online Thursday morning, before starting <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2019/03/13/beto-orourke-heads-iowa-three-day-swing-first-2020-campaign\">a three-day trip to Iowa</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really proud of what El Paso did and what El Paso represents,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Rourke said in <a href=\"https://www.ktsm.com/news/politics/beto-o-rourke-is-running-for-president-in-2020-ktsm-confirms/1846804405\">a text to KTSM</a>, Wednesday night. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big part of why I&rsquo;m running.

In the announcement video released early Thursday, sitting alongside his wife Amy, O&rsquo;Rourke said that he would hold a rally in the border city on March 30 to formally kick off his campaign, suggesting that his challenge to Trump would lean heavily on his alternative vision of what immigration represents for America.</p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\"><p>I am running to serve you as the next president.

In 2018, some of the key staffers behind it, including Becky Bond and and Zack Malitz, joined O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s Texas Senate campaign and<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/10/16/beto-o-rourke-campaign-donations/\"> took distributed organizing to the next level</a>. They and some other veterans of the Sanders campaign have stayed with O&rsquo;Rourke, even as Sanders has re-launched his presidential bid.</p>\n<p>The request for volunteers to send text messages may seem fairly standard, but there&rsquo;s something revolutionary about it from an organizing perspective. It empowers volunteers from the very start to begin to take actually useful action on behalf of the campaign. And it requires an immense amount of trust in the campaign&rsquo;s supporters, but it also requires a message and a messenger that people believe passionately in. O&rsquo;Rourke very much was that in his 2018 Senate bid, partially because his unapologetically progressive affect stood in such stark contrast to the national understanding of Texas politics. O&rsquo;Rourke also benefited greatly from running against a widely reviled Republican opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz. Whether the energy he harnessed in 2018 carries with him into a 2020 presidential run could be determined as early as the first few days of the run.</p>\n<p>If those volunteers respond with a barrage of text messages that generate new volunteers and add up to big money, O&rsquo;Rourke is in the hunt. O&rsquo;Rourke, though, is viewed skeptically by a segment of the left, which worries that he is a new <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/hes-barack-obama-but-white-beto-o-rourke-blows-up-the-us-2020-democratic-primary/\">version of Barack Obama</a>, a blank canvas on which the hopeful can paint their political dreams, only to be disappointed as he seeks deals with industry or the GOP. Democrats are confident that Trump can be defeated in 2020, but there are questions as to whether O&rsquo;Rourke has the drive to defeat Trumpism. He has hinted in essays from the road about the threat of fascism in America and said that he recognizes today&rsquo;s GOP isn&rsquo;t interested in compromise, yet his ever-hopeful spirit has some progressives worried that he&rsquo;d squander his presidency hoping Republicans change. And <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lissandravilla/beto-orourke-green-new-deal-el-paso\">while he has praised </a>the Green New Deal, his roots in Texas &mdash; and his public comments themselves, in which he has said fossil fuels can be a part of the solution to climate change &mdash; have further worried some Democrats that he may not fully grasp the existential nature of the threat.</p>\n<p>The 46-year-old enters a crowded Democratic primary field just four months after his unsuccessful effort to unseat Cruz earned him national recognition and glowing reviews from <a href=\"https://crooked.com/articles/beto-president-2020/\">campaign veterans</a> excited by the former indie rocker&rsquo;s potential to excite small-dollar donors and connect with younger voters through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/grace_panetta/status/1083394103071645696\">rampant oversharing</a> on a host of social networks.</p>\n<p>The former Texas representative shunned traditional polling in his race against Cruz, but did his own version of focus groups. By traveling to deeply conservative areas and taking questions until each audience was exhausted, he got a priceless feel for what was on the minds of voters. He didn&rsquo;t skip polling for a lack of campaign funds. His small-dollar operation pulled in so much money &mdash; $80 million by the end &mdash; that the term record simply doesn&rsquo;t do it justice. He raised more, for instance, than Jeb Bush did for his entire 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>Yet it all started with weed.</p>\n<p><u>In the latter</u> half of the 2000s, a bloody drug-cartel war was raging just across the border from El Paso in Juarez, Mexico. The intractable conflict was claiming tens of thousands of lives and producing a climate of fear in the region. Most politicians were calling for an ever-more militarized response, which only fed the conflict. O&rsquo;Rourke, then on the city council, introduced a resolution that took a different approach. Given that the war was being driven by demand for an illegal product, perhaps the United States should consider legalizing and regulating that product, he suggested. His focus was on marijuana, but he also called for &ldquo;an honest, open national debate on ending the prohibition of narcotics.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s resolution passed 8-0 and was headed to the mayor&rsquo;s desk for his signature when the local congressman, Rep. Sylvestre Reyes, a conservative Democrat and former border patrol guard, sent a letter, along with other Texas congressmen, to the mayor, calling on him to veto it.</p>\n<p>The mayor complied, and Reyes then lobbied each council member privately, making veiled threats that the city would lose federal money if the veto was overridden.</p>\n<p>Four members of the council switched their votes and supported the veto; three of them publicly cited the funding threat as the reason for backing down.</p>\n<p>After reading an acknowledgement from Reyes <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/14/drug-legalization-debate_n_157798.html\">to The Huffington Post</a> that he had used the threat of cuts to federal funding for El Paso to quash the legalization effort, O&rsquo;Rourke was so livid he vowed to primary Reyes.</p>\n<p><em>(A full recounting of the incident will appear in the forthcoming book </em>We&rsquo;ve Got People; <em>portions of this article are drawn from it. <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/forms/get-an-email-when-ryan-grims-book-iweve-got-peoplei-is-published/\">Sign up here to get an email when it&rsquo;s published next month.</a> )</em></p>\n<p>He launched that challenge in 2011 and his upset of Reyes was itself historic, as it marked the first time a member of Congress had lost his job for being too tough on the war on drugs. That insurgent victory reoriented political incentives in Washington, as all of a sudden Democrats had to think twice about their drug-war rhetoric. O&rsquo;Rourke restated his support for ending the prohibition on marijuana at his first stop in Iowa on Thursday.</p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\"><p>Speaking to a crowd in Iowa, Beto O'Rourke says &quot;we should end the federal prohibition on marijuana,&quot; adding that the people hurt most by marijuana prohibition &quot;do not look like this room.

During freshman orientation, one presentation from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee felt particularly ominous.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-reactid=\"238\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mnZ8y0q2C5Q?autoplay=0&rel=0&enablejsapi=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com&widgetid=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>It came on Nov. 16, 2012, barely a week after the election, and it was all about fundraising.</p>\n<p>The amount of time that members of Congress in both parties spend fundraising is widely known to take up an obscene portion of a typical day &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s &ldquo;call time&rdquo; spent on the phone with potential donors, or in person at fundraisers in Washington or back home. Seeing it spelled out in black and white, however, can be a jarring experience for a new member.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke and the other freshmen were shown <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/08/call-time-congressional-fundraising_n_2427291.html\">a PowerPoint presentation</a> laying out the dreary existence awaiting these new back-benchers. The daily schedule prescribed by the Democratic leadership contemplated a nine or 10-hour day while in Washington. Of that, four hours were to be spent in &ldquo;call time&rdquo; and another hour was blocked off for &ldquo;strategic outreach,&rdquo; which includes fundraisers and press work.</p>\n<p>An hour was walled off to &ldquo;recharge,&rdquo; and three to four hours were designated for the actual work of being a member of Congress &mdash; hearings, votes, and meetings with constituents. If the constituents were donors, all the better. The presentation assured members that their fundraising would be closely monitored; the Federal Election Commission requires members to file quarterly reports.</p>\n<p>Even members in safe districts, they were told, were expected to keep up the torrid fundraising pace, so that they could contribute to the defense of vulnerable colleagues.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know really what call time was until I was elected and sworn in to become a member of Congress, and the real first orientation that I had up on the Hill by our leadership in the Democratic Party&hellip;they kind of broke out for the newly elected members of Congress, here&rsquo;s what we want you to do during your day. So in the morning we want you to go to what is known as a PAC breakfast. You&rsquo;re going to meet with lobbyists for the different industries and corporations and special interests who have business on the Hill. Get to know them, introduce yourself, tell them who you are, and then that&rsquo;s going to lead to the next thing on your calendar, which is &lsquo;call time.&rsquo; We&rsquo;re going to put you in a boiler room where there&rsquo;s a series of cubicles where these representatives of the people of the United States of America are furiously making cold calls or slightly warm calls to those PACs and lobbyists and representatives of the special interests to ask them for money to fund their campaign, to finance their reelection.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And then you may go into the office,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Rourke continued, &ldquo;you may go to the floor and take some votes, and then we want you back to what they called the d triple c to do some more call time. And then that evening we want you to go to a fundraiser or a get-together to meet more prospects to feed the call time that you&rsquo;re going to have the next day. And when I calculated it, 40 to 50 percent of every single day we were being asked to call people for money.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It sounded miserable to O&rsquo;Rourke, but he assumed that this was just how it would have to be done. &ldquo;Like just about any other member of Congress, I hired a Washington-DC based fundraiser who puts me in those call time boiler rooms to call those special interests, those PACs, introduce myself and say, &lsquo;Hey, could you write a 5,000 dollar check to the campaign? It&rsquo;s really important that we show strength right out of the gate so that we do well and that we don&rsquo;t have a challenger and I can focus on delivering to the people of El Paso,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t feel right to me and I&rsquo;m sure it doesn&rsquo;t feel right to anybody doing that, but I just thought that&rsquo;s what we do now that we&rsquo;re in Congress.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He was reassured, though, that some of the fundraising targets would be hit easily. After he&rsquo;d won his primary, after all, checks began pouring in from corporate PACs around the country, eager to ingratiate themselves with the incoming member of Congress. He hadn&rsquo;t solicited any of them, he reasoned, so what harm could there be in cashing the checks?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Almost overnight. Political Action Committee checks just flood in, rain down on us, from everywhere, unsolicited &mdash; didn&rsquo;t even know that some of these PACs or industries or interests existed. And we thought it was great. No more awkward phone calls to Amy&rsquo;s gynecologist,&rdquo; he said, recalling that one of his first fundraising calls had been to his wife&rsquo;s OBGYN. &ldquo;These folks are gonna fund the campaign going forward and I can focus on the work that I want to do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That money, though, comes with obvious, but translucent strings attached. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to change who you are in any fundamental way,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Rourke, explaining why corporate fundraising can be so pernicious. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re not on the defense committee, and you could care less what&rsquo;s in the defense bill, but you know that there&rsquo;s a $10,000 check coming from Boeing. Why pissed those guys off? Why not just vote their way, if it&rsquo;s no skin off your back and you don&rsquo;t understand the issue very well to begin with?&rdquo; he said, laying out the mindset that makes voting with Boeing more likely than not.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of priorities, he said. Most members of Congress have a handful of issues they care deeply about &mdash; what he called &ldquo;issues one through ten&rdquo; &mdash; and on the rest, they&rsquo;re ambivalent. It&rsquo;s on the rest where the calculus is easily made that the smarter move is just to vote with the money.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No amount of money is going to buy you, but we will vote on 1,200 different items every session of Congress, so items 11 through 1,200, why not make these guys or these gals happy by voting their way, keeping the money coming in and allow you to focus on one through 10?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At SXSW last year, O&rsquo;Rourke recounted the moment he decided to swear off fundraising in the typical fashion. When he voted against a farm bill on the advice of his legislative aide, even though it would have granted a favor to a farmers&rsquo; PAC that gave him a big donation, his DC fundraiser berated him. &ldquo;What in the hell are you doing?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last time you&rsquo;ll ever get a check from them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it. You know, loved working with you, but we&rsquo;re done, I&rsquo;m not doing this anymore because this is fucked up that that thought is even going across our minds right now, that we would vote a certain way based on money coming in or potentially coming in.'&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And it explains so much of the dysfunction in that place,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Rourke added of Washington, &ldquo;because, the news to me when I got there was not only how screwed up fundraising is, and how fundamental it is to everything else that occurs there, but most of the people that I work with are decent human beings, they&rsquo;re good people who came there for the right reasons they want to do good by and for the people who sent them up to Congress, but they&rsquo;ve been compromised by this system.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>El Paso is home to Fort Bliss and its more than 30,000 enlisted members of the U.S. Army, so O&rsquo;Rourke fought to get on the Armed Services Committee shortly before the election. But he was already developing a reputation as somebody who wasn&rsquo;t enthusiastic about fundraising, so the party leadership kept him off.</p>\n<p>He said he was told by another member of Congress who was in the meeting where the decision was made that his unenthusiastic approach to fundraising kept him off the committee. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t appoint you to that committee your first session in Congress because they just didn&rsquo;t think you were going to make the money off of it,&rdquo; he said he was told. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t going to ask those defense contractors for the checks and it is a squandered opportunity for our party to have you in that seat. That&rsquo;s like a wasted seat for us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke has long been intrigued by the hopeful prospect of bipartisanship. His first Facebook Live video to go viral, in fact, was <a href=\"https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/politics/blogs/tx-capital-report/2017/03/16/20-best-moments-orourke-hurds-road-trip/99223134/\">his long car ride</a> from Texas to Washington with GOP Rep. Will Hurd, who represented the district next to O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s, stretching 800 miles from El Paso to San Antonio.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The number one imperative that we had, we were told as members of Congress, is to get re-elected and to get your fellow Democrats re-elected, and to defeat those Republicans with whom you serve, so that we can be in the majority and do great stuff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But in order to do that, we&rsquo;re going to compromise ourselves, and I don&rsquo;t want you to spend any time getting to know your Republican colleagues. I don&rsquo;t want you to spend any time becoming the subject matter expert on the shit that you&rsquo;re going to be working on the next day.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A bipartisan caucus dedicated to solving problems sounded good to O&rsquo;Rourke, which is why he entertained the idea of joining the Problem Solvers Caucus, which was sponsored by No Labels. His legislative director warned him it would be useless or worse, but he went to one of the first meetings. To his credit, he came back from it shaking his head and never did join.</p>\n<p>To his discredit, he joined the New Democrat Coalition, the Wall Street-friendly wing of the party. On a personal and stylistic level, the move makes sense, as it fits O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s desire for common ground &mdash; the Obama refrain of no blue states or red states, only the United States. And O&rsquo;Rourke grew up deeply privileged, with a powerful father and education at an elite boarding school in Virginia. (He was born Robert O&rsquo;Rourke to his Irish-American family, but was nicknamed Beto at birth &mdash; Beto being a common shortening of Robert in El Paso.)</p>\n<p>On the question of the substance, though, his attraction to bipartisanship clashes with some of O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s progressive political instincts, the type that led to a call for the legalization of all narcotics in 2009, for instance. At the height of the 2014 migration crisis at the border, when asked about the U.S. role in destabilizing Central America, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/18/refugee-crisis-border_n_5596125.html\">he dove into the history of the Dulles brothers,</a> the CIA&rsquo;s overthrow of Arbenz, and its history of support for dirty wars.</p>\n<p>And then there was his early refusal to take PAC money. But, again, complicating the picture is his refusal to take <em>any</em> PAC money, even from liberal groups, unions, or anybody else. Not all corporations are the same, but a blanket refusal of all corporate PAC money makes sense. And some labor money comes with strings attached that could arguably be detrimental to the public. But it&rsquo;s a policy reminiscent, again, of Obama, who for most of his first term would only criticize &ldquo;Washington&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Republicans.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And then there&rsquo;s Israel, a foreign policy subject that has <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/12/there-is-a-taboo-against-criticizing-aipac-and-ilhan-omar-just-destroyed-it/\">split the Democratic party</a> in recent months, where O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s record suggests he might hew closer to young progressives.</p>\n<p>In July 2014, while O&rsquo;Rourke was still a freshman, Israel launched a bombing campaign and then ground invasion of Gaza, after Hamas militants kidnapped and murdered three Israeli teenagers. A United Nations report would later find evidence of Israeli war crimes against civilians in the barrage that followed, which killed more than a thousand people, many of them children. O&rsquo;Rourke said at the time he thought of his three small children as he saw images of young ones pulled from the rubble of Israeli shellings of densely populated areas.</p>\n<p>His emotional reaction at the time seemed to be a genuine one, and he was determined not to let the slaughter happen in his name. Before adjourning for the summer recess, the House rushed through an aide package to support the Israeli Iron Dome missile interceptor system. The timing of the vote was purely symbolic &mdash; the money wasn&rsquo;t needed at the moment, but Congress wanted to rush it to show full-throated support of Israel at the height of the war, even as nations around the world were condemning its assault.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke cast one of just eight votes against the money, and the response from the pro-Israel lobby was swift, furious and well-coordinated, hitting him everywhere from the New Yorker to his local paper. &ldquo;I could not in good conscience vote for borrowing $225 million more to send to Israel, without debate and without discussion, in the midst of a war that has cost more than a thousand civilian lives already, too many of them children,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Rourke posted on Facebook.</p>\n<p>Responding to the uproar, he held a series of meetings with pro-Israel groups and local Jewish leaders, agreeing to visit Israel on AIPAC&rsquo;s dime the next year, and the lobby expressed hope that O&rsquo;Rourke would come around and oppose the Iran nuclear deal Obama had been negotiating.</p>\n<p>The threat from the Israel lobby to unseat O&rsquo;Rourke never materialized. The next March, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Washington and addressed Congress at the invitation of the House Speaker John Boehner &mdash; not the president, as is the custom &mdash; and O&rsquo;Rourke was one of 58 Democrats to boycott the speech.</p>\n<p>That spring, he took the trip to Israel he had promised. When he returned, he was asked a town hall if he&rsquo;d have voted differently knowing then what he knew now. No, he said, &ldquo;I think our unequivocal support at times has been damaging to Israel.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That summer, the Iran deal was finalized and O&rsquo;Rourke declared it &ldquo;an impressive diplomatic achievement that has the potential to peacefully resolve one of the most intractable problems facing our country and the world today,&rdquo; pledging his support. Like the rest of Congress, he continued broadly supporting foreign aid for Israel, but the unrelenting pressure campaign from the lobby had failed.</p>\n<p>Asked in 2018 if he still supported the Iran deal, which Israel backers like Sheldon Adelson urged Trump to withdraw from, O&rsquo;Rourke described the agreement as imperfect, but vital, and &ldquo;almost a miracle of modern diplomacy.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\"><p>Although the Iran Deal is not perfection, it is a critical international effort to ensure Iran doesn't acquire nuclear weapons.

Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn&rsquo;t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren&rsquo;t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don&rsquo;t have ads, so we depend on our members &mdash; 35,000 and counting &mdash; to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn&rsquo;t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month. That&rsquo;s all it takes to support the journalism you rely on.</p>",

                "text": "Ending months of speculation, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke told a television station in his native El Paso that he is joining the race for president, and released a video announcement online Thursday morning, before starting a three-day trip to Iowa.\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of what El Paso did and what El Paso represents,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in a text to KTSM, Wednesday night. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of why I\u2019m running. This city is the best example of this country at its best.\u201d\nO\u2019Rourke led a protest against President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed border wall in El Paso last month. In the announcement video released early Thursday, sitting alongside his wife Amy, O\u2019Rourke said that he would hold a rally in the border city on March 30 to formally kick off his campaign, suggesting that his challenge to Trump would lean heavily on his alternative vision of what immigration represents for America.\nI am running to serve you as the next president. The challenges we face are the greatest in living memory. No one person can meet them on their own. Only this country can do that, and only if we build a movement that includes all of us. Say you're in: https://t.co/EKLdkVET2u pic.twitter.com/lainXyvG2n\n\u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) March 14, 2019\nThe former congressperson promised to run a positive campaign and sounded the alarm about the need for an American president who would seriously address climate change, voter suppression, and find a way to \u201cend these decadeslong wars.\u201d\nThe El Paso Times noted that O\u2019Rourke lives so close to the border that his front porch \u201chas views of Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico.\u201d He told the newspaper that his campaign will be based in El Paso, partly because \u201ca firsthand perspective and experience from the border is missing from the conversation.\u201d\nIn a subsequent email to supporters, O\u2019Rourke wrote: \u201cAt this moment of truth \u2014 at this moment where we could make or break our democracy, where we will decide the fate of generations to come on this planet \u2014 we must all ask what each of us can give to this country and to the people who will inherit the consequences of our choices.\u201d\nRumors of an impending announcement were swirling around Washington throughout the day on Wednesday, with the biggest clue that O\u2019Rourke was preparing to announce coming when his camp emailed volunteers on the Senate campaign, telling them, \u201cWe need help sending some text messages tomorrow morning.\u201d That\u2019s a reference to what\u2019s known as distributed organizing, which became a driving factor that powered the Bernie Sanders campaign in 2016. In 2018, some of the key staffers behind it, including Becky Bond and and Zack Malitz, joined O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Texas Senate campaign and took distributed organizing to the next level. They and some other veterans of the Sanders campaign have stayed with O\u2019Rourke, even as Sanders has re-launched his presidential bid.\nThe request for volunteers to send text messages may seem fairly standard, but there\u2019s something revolutionary about it from an organizing perspective. It empowers volunteers from the very start to begin to take actually useful action on behalf of the campaign. And it requires an immense amount of trust in the campaign\u2019s supporters, but it also requires a message and a messenger that people believe passionately in. O\u2019Rourke very much was that in his 2018 Senate bid, partially because his unapologetically progressive affect stood in such stark contrast to the national understanding of Texas politics. O\u2019Rourke also benefited greatly from running against a widely reviled Republican opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz. Whether the energy he harnessed in 2018 carries with him into a 2020 presidential run could be determined as early as the first few days of the run.\nIf those volunteers respond with a barrage of text messages that generate new volunteers and add up to big money, O\u2019Rourke is in the hunt. O\u2019Rourke, though, is viewed skeptically by a segment of the left, which worries that he is a new version of Barack Obama, a blank canvas on which the hopeful can paint their political dreams, only to be disappointed as he seeks deals with industry or the GOP. Democrats are confident that Trump can be defeated in 2020, but there are questions as to whether O\u2019Rourke has the drive to defeat Trumpism. He has hinted in essays from the road about the threat of fascism in America and said that he recognizes today\u2019s GOP isn\u2019t interested in compromise, yet his ever-hopeful spirit has some progressives worried that he\u2019d squander his presidency hoping Republicans change. And while he has praised the Green New Deal, his roots in Texas \u2014 and his public comments themselves, in which he has said fossil fuels can be a part of the solution to climate change \u2014 have further worried some Democrats that he may not fully grasp the existential nature of the threat.\nThe 46-year-old enters a crowded Democratic primary field just four months after his unsuccessful effort to unseat Cruz earned him national recognition and glowing reviews from campaign veterans excited by the former indie rocker\u2019s potential to excite small-dollar donors and connect with younger voters through rampant oversharing on a host of social networks.\nThe former Texas representative shunned traditional polling in his race against Cruz, but did his own version of focus groups. By traveling to deeply conservative areas and taking questions until each audience was exhausted, he got a priceless feel for what was on the minds of voters. He didn\u2019t skip polling for a lack of campaign funds. His small-dollar operation pulled in so much money \u2014 $80 million by the end \u2014 that the term record simply doesn\u2019t do it justice. He raised more, for instance, than Jeb Bush did for his entire 2016 presidential campaign.\nYet it all started with weed.\nIn the latter half of the 2000s, a bloody drug-cartel war was raging just across the border from El Paso in Juarez, Mexico. The intractable conflict was claiming tens of thousands of lives and producing a climate of fear in the region. Most politicians were calling for an ever-more militarized response, which only fed the conflict. O\u2019Rourke, then on the city council, introduced a resolution that took a different approach. Given that the war was being driven by demand for an illegal product, perhaps the United States should consider legalizing and regulating that product, he suggested. His focus was on marijuana, but he also called for \u201can honest, open national debate on ending the prohibition of narcotics.\u201d\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s resolution passed 8-0 and was headed to the mayor\u2019s desk for his signature when the local congressman, Rep. Sylvestre Reyes, a conservative Democrat and former border patrol guard, sent a letter, along with other Texas congressmen, to the mayor, calling on him to veto it.\nThe mayor complied, and Reyes then lobbied each council member privately, making veiled threats that the city would lose federal money if the veto was overridden.\nFour members of the council switched their votes and supported the veto; three of them publicly cited the funding threat as the reason for backing down.\nAfter reading an acknowledgement from Reyes to The Huffington Post that he had used the threat of cuts to federal funding for El Paso to quash the legalization effort, O\u2019Rourke was so livid he vowed to primary Reyes.\n(A full recounting of the incident will appear in the forthcoming book We\u2019ve Got People; portions of this article are drawn from it. Sign up here to get an email when it\u2019s published next month. )\nHe launched that challenge in 2011 and his upset of Reyes was itself historic, as it marked the first time a member of Congress had lost his job for being too tough on the war on drugs. That insurgent victory reoriented political incentives in Washington, as all of a sudden Democrats had to think twice about their drug-war rhetoric. O\u2019Rourke restated his support for ending the prohibition on marijuana at his first stop in Iowa on Thursday.\nSpeaking to a crowd in Iowa, Beto O'Rourke says \"we should end the federal prohibition on marijuana,\" adding that the people hurt most by marijuana prohibition \"do not look like this room. They are browner and blacker than most of America.\" https://t.co/jVu5m4xu8R pic.twitter.com/2LJM3fQC36\n\u2014 CNN (@CNN) March 14, 2019\nAs O\u2019Rourke recalled during a 2018 conversation with The Intercept at SXSW, after his election, he had a hard time finding his footing. During freshman orientation, one presentation from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee felt particularly ominous.\nIt came on Nov. 16, 2012, barely a week after the election, and it was all about fundraising.\nThe amount of time that members of Congress in both parties spend fundraising is widely known to take up an obscene portion of a typical day \u2014 whether it\u2019s \u201ccall time\u201d spent on the phone with potential donors, or in person at fundraisers in Washington or back home. Seeing it spelled out in black and white, however, can be a jarring experience for a new member.\nO\u2019Rourke and the other freshmen were shown a PowerPoint presentation laying out the dreary existence awaiting these new back-benchers. The daily schedule prescribed by the Democratic leadership contemplated a nine or 10-hour day while in Washington. Of that, four hours were to be spent in \u201ccall time\u201d and another hour was blocked off for \u201cstrategic outreach,\u201d which includes fundraisers and press work.\nAn hour was walled off to \u201crecharge,\u201d and three to four hours were designated for the actual work of being a member of Congress \u2014 hearings, votes, and meetings with constituents. If the constituents were donors, all the better. The presentation assured members that their fundraising would be closely monitored; the Federal Election Commission requires members to file quarterly reports.\nEven members in safe districts, they were told, were expected to keep up the torrid fundraising pace, so that they could contribute to the defense of vulnerable colleagues.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know really what call time was until I was elected and sworn in to become a member of Congress, and the real first orientation that I had up on the Hill by our leadership in the Democratic Party\u2026they kind of broke out for the newly elected members of Congress, here\u2019s what we want you to do during your day. So in the morning we want you to go to what is known as a PAC breakfast. You\u2019re going to meet with lobbyists for the different industries and corporations and special interests who have business on the Hill. Get to know them, introduce yourself, tell them who you are, and then that\u2019s going to lead to the next thing on your calendar, which is \u2018call time.\u2019 We\u2019re going to put you in a boiler room where there\u2019s a series of cubicles where these representatives of the people of the United States of America are furiously making cold calls or slightly warm calls to those PACs and lobbyists and representatives of the special interests to ask them for money to fund their campaign, to finance their reelection.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then you may go into the office,\u201d O\u2019Rourke continued, \u201cyou may go to the floor and take some votes, and then we want you back to what they called the d triple c to do some more call time. And then that evening we want you to go to a fundraiser or a get-together to meet more prospects to feed the call time that you\u2019re going to have the next day. And when I calculated it, 40 to 50 percent of every single day we were being asked to call people for money.\u201d\nIt sounded miserable to O\u2019Rourke, but he assumed that this was just how it would have to be done. \u201cLike just about any other member of Congress, I hired a Washington-DC based fundraiser who puts me in those call time boiler rooms to call those special interests, those PACs, introduce myself and say, \u2018Hey, could you write a 5,000 dollar check to the campaign? It\u2019s really important that we show strength right out of the gate so that we do well and that we don\u2019t have a challenger and I can focus on delivering to the people of El Paso,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right to me and I\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t feel right to anybody doing that, but I just thought that\u2019s what we do now that we\u2019re in Congress.\u201d\nHe was reassured, though, that some of the fundraising targets would be hit easily. After he\u2019d won his primary, after all, checks began pouring in from corporate PACs around the country, eager to ingratiate themselves with the incoming member of Congress. He hadn\u2019t solicited any of them, he reasoned, so what harm could there be in cashing the checks?\n\u201cAlmost overnight. Political Action Committee checks just flood in, rain down on us, from everywhere, unsolicited \u2014 didn\u2019t even know that some of these PACs or industries or interests existed. And we thought it was great. No more awkward phone calls to Amy\u2019s gynecologist,\u201d he said, recalling that one of his first fundraising calls had been to his wife\u2019s OBGYN. \u201cThese folks are gonna fund the campaign going forward and I can focus on the work that I want to do.\u201d\nThat money, though, comes with obvious, but translucent strings attached. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change who you are in any fundamental way,\u201d said O\u2019Rourke, explaining why corporate fundraising can be so pernicious. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re not on the defense committee, and you could care less what\u2019s in the defense bill, but you know that there\u2019s a $10,000 check coming from Boeing. Why pissed those guys off? Why not just vote their way, if it\u2019s no skin off your back and you don\u2019t understand the issue very well to begin with?\u201d he said, laying out the mindset that makes voting with Boeing more likely than not.\nIt\u2019s a matter of priorities, he said. Most members of Congress have a handful of issues they care deeply about \u2014 what he called \u201cissues one through ten\u201d \u2014 and on the rest, they\u2019re ambivalent. It\u2019s on the rest where the calculus is easily made that the smarter move is just to vote with the money.\n\u201cNo amount of money is going to buy you, but we will vote on 1,200 different items every session of Congress, so items 11 through 1,200, why not make these guys or these gals happy by voting their way, keeping the money coming in and allow you to focus on one through 10?\u201d\nAt SXSW last year, O\u2019Rourke recounted the moment he decided to swear off fundraising in the typical fashion. When he voted against a farm bill on the advice of his legislative aide, even though it would have granted a favor to a farmers\u2019 PAC that gave him a big donation, his DC fundraiser berated him. \u201cWhat in the hell are you doing?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat\u2019s the last time you\u2019ll ever get a check from them.\u201d\n\u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s it. You know, loved working with you, but we\u2019re done, I\u2019m not doing this anymore because this is fucked up that that thought is even going across our minds right now, that we would vote a certain way based on money coming in or potentially coming in.'\u201d\n\u201cAnd it explains so much of the dysfunction in that place,\u201d O\u2019Rourke added of Washington, \u201cbecause, the news to me when I got there was not only how screwed up fundraising is, and how fundamental it is to everything else that occurs there, but most of the people that I work with are decent human beings, they\u2019re good people who came there for the right reasons they want to do good by and for the people who sent them up to Congress, but they\u2019ve been compromised by this system.\u201d\nEl Paso is home to Fort Bliss and its more than 30,000 enlisted members of the U.S. Army, so O\u2019Rourke fought to get on the Armed Services Committee shortly before the election. But he was already developing a reputation as somebody who wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about fundraising, so the party leadership kept him off.\nHe said he was told by another member of Congress who was in the meeting where the decision was made that his unenthusiastic approach to fundraising kept him off the committee. \u201cThey didn\u2019t appoint you to that committee your first session in Congress because they just didn\u2019t think you were going to make the money off of it,\u201d he said he was told. \u201cYou weren\u2019t going to ask those defense contractors for the checks and it is a squandered opportunity for our party to have you in that seat. That\u2019s like a wasted seat for us.\u201d\nO\u2019Rourke has long been intrigued by the hopeful prospect of bipartisanship. His first Facebook Live video to go viral, in fact, was his long car ride from Texas to Washington with GOP Rep. Will Hurd, who represented the district next to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, stretching 800 miles from El Paso to San Antonio.\n\u201cThe number one imperative that we had, we were told as members of Congress, is to get re-elected and to get your fellow Democrats re-elected, and to defeat those Republicans with whom you serve, so that we can be in the majority and do great stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in order to do that, we\u2019re going to compromise ourselves, and I don\u2019t want you to spend any time getting to know your Republican colleagues. I don\u2019t want you to spend any time becoming the subject matter expert on the shit that you\u2019re going to be working on the next day.\u201d\nA bipartisan caucus dedicated to solving problems sounded good to O\u2019Rourke, which is why he entertained the idea of joining the Problem Solvers Caucus, which was sponsored by No Labels. His legislative director warned him it would be useless or worse, but he went to one of the first meetings. To his credit, he came back from it shaking his head and never did join.\nTo his discredit, he joined the New Democrat Coalition, the Wall Street-friendly wing of the party. On a personal and stylistic level, the move makes sense, as it fits O\u2019Rourke\u2019s desire for common ground \u2014 the Obama refrain of no blue states or red states, only the United States. And O\u2019Rourke grew up deeply privileged, with a powerful father and education at an elite boarding school in Virginia. (He was born Robert O\u2019Rourke to his Irish-American family, but was nicknamed Beto at birth \u2014 Beto being a common shortening of Robert in El Paso.)\nOn the question of the substance, though, his attraction to bipartisanship clashes with some of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s progressive political instincts, the type that led to a call for the legalization of all narcotics in 2009, for instance. At the height of the 2014 migration crisis at the border, when asked about the U.S. role in destabilizing Central America, he dove into the history of the Dulles brothers, the CIA\u2019s overthrow of Arbenz, and its history of support for dirty wars.\nAnd then there was his early refusal to take PAC money. But, again, complicating the picture is his refusal to take any PAC money, even from liberal groups, unions, or anybody else. Not all corporations are the same, but a blanket refusal of all corporate PAC money makes sense. And some labor money comes with strings attached that could arguably be detrimental to the public. But it\u2019s a policy reminiscent, again, of Obama, who for most of his first term would only criticize \u201cWashington\u201d rather than \u201cRepublicans.\u201d\nAnd then there\u2019s Israel, a foreign policy subject that has split the Democratic party in recent months, where O\u2019Rourke\u2019s record suggests he might hew closer to young progressives.\nIn July 2014, while O\u2019Rourke was still a freshman, Israel launched a bombing campaign and then ground invasion of Gaza, after Hamas militants kidnapped and murdered three Israeli teenagers. A United Nations report would later find evidence of Israeli war crimes against civilians in the barrage that followed, which killed more than a thousand people, many of them children. O\u2019Rourke said at the time he thought of his three small children as he saw images of young ones pulled from the rubble of Israeli shellings of densely populated areas.\nHis emotional reaction at the time seemed to be a genuine one, and he was determined not to let the slaughter happen in his name. Before adjourning for the summer recess, the House rushed through an aide package to support the Israeli Iron Dome missile interceptor system. The timing of the vote was purely symbolic \u2014 the money wasn\u2019t needed at the moment, but Congress wanted to rush it to show full-throated support of Israel at the height of the war, even as nations around the world were condemning its assault.\nO\u2019Rourke cast one of just eight votes against the money, and the response from the pro-Israel lobby was swift, furious and well-coordinated, hitting him everywhere from the New Yorker to his local paper. \u201cI could not in good conscience vote for borrowing $225 million more to send to Israel, without debate and without discussion, in the midst of a war that has cost more than a thousand civilian lives already, too many of them children,\u201d O\u2019Rourke posted on Facebook.\nResponding to the uproar, he held a series of meetings with pro-Israel groups and local Jewish leaders, agreeing to visit Israel on AIPAC\u2019s dime the next year, and the lobby expressed hope that O\u2019Rourke would come around and oppose the Iran nuclear deal Obama had been negotiating.\nThe threat from the Israel lobby to unseat O\u2019Rourke never materialized. The next March, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Washington and addressed Congress at the invitation of the House Speaker John Boehner \u2014 not the president, as is the custom \u2014 and O\u2019Rourke was one of 58 Democrats to boycott the speech.\nThat spring, he took the trip to Israel he had promised. When he returned, he was asked a town hall if he\u2019d have voted differently knowing then what he knew now. No, he said, \u201cI think our unequivocal support at times has been damaging to Israel.\u201d\nThat summer, the Iran deal was finalized and O\u2019Rourke declared it \u201can impressive diplomatic achievement that has the potential to peacefully resolve one of the most intractable problems facing our country and the world today,\u201d pledging his support. Like the rest of Congress, he continued broadly supporting foreign aid for Israel, but the unrelenting pressure campaign from the lobby had failed.\nAsked in 2018 if he still supported the Iran deal, which Israel backers like Sheldon Adelson urged Trump to withdraw from, O\u2019Rourke described the agreement as imperfect, but vital, and \u201calmost a miracle of modern diplomacy.\u201d\nAlthough the Iran Deal is not perfection, it is a critical international effort to ensure Iran doesn't acquire nuclear weapons. The United States of America should not be giving up on diplomacy. pic.twitter.com/9JvUFocPBm\n\u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) May 8, 2018\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s membership of the centrist New Democrat Coalition, and a series of votes he cast against the progressive agenda on a variety of issues, has already been identified by Republicans as a potential weakness in a Democratic primary field with progressive champions like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Last week, the Club for Growth released an attack ad it plans to run in Iowa comparing O\u2019Rourke\u2019s record on progressive issues unfavorably to that of former President Barack Obama.\nWait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn\u2019t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren\u2019t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet.

She didn&rsquo;t want an iPhone, new clothes or &mdash; banish the thought &mdash; a car. Cars and trucks account for about <a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/car-emissions-and-global-warming\">a fifth</a> of greenhouse gas emissions, and a significant amount of Fernands&rsquo;s climate anxiety. &ldquo;Sometimes we&rsquo;ll be stuck in traffic and I&rsquo;ll look outside and watch the exhaust coming out of the car in front of me and I&rsquo;ll freak out,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;I feel so powerless to stop it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Fernands has been struggling with that sense of helplessness since she first became keyed into the accelerating timetable of climate change in seventh grade. &ldquo;It seemed like the end of the world,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But the apocalyptic message wasn&rsquo;t being broadcast.

Marcela Mulholland, a senior at the University of Florida, grew up in South Florida and has experienced the ravages of flooding, storms, and rising temperatures firsthand. &ldquo;I was drawn to this work because of a deep sense of pain,&rdquo; said Mulholland.</p>\n<p>But over the past year, as she&rsquo;s begun to volunteer with the <a href=\"https://www.sunrisemovement.org/\">Sunrise Movement</a>, Mulholland has experienced a dramatic emotional shift. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found that there are other people who feel just as depressed and sad about it and are choosing to do something about these problems,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There has been no better antidote to despair and hopelessness than finding the other people who feel as I do and working with them to fix what is breaking our hearts.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Climate change is causing mental anguish in people of all ages, according to Lise Van Susteren, a psychiatrist and member of the <a href=\"https://www.climatepsychiatry.org/\">Climate Psychiatry Alliance</a>. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re hearing day in and day out that we&rsquo;ve got 12 years, we&rsquo;ve got 11 years, the oceans are collapsing, fires are burning, air quality is terrible, wear a mask, the anxiety is inescapable,&rdquo; said Van Susteren. &ldquo;It sticks itself into dark crevices in your brain.&rdquo; For kids, she said, there&rsquo;s often an added emotional layer of feeling betrayed by the older generation&rsquo;s inaction.</p>\n<p>Justine Berfond, a 22-year-old who lives in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, agrees. &ldquo;The tough thing is when the adults in our lives are like, don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; said Berfond, a senior at New York University. &ldquo;They have good intentions. It&rsquo;s like when you think there&rsquo;s a monster under the bed when you&rsquo;re little, and they tell you you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. But in this case, the monster is real.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Berfond, who has been terrified about climate change since elementary school, has found relief in sharing some of the anxieties she used to keep to herself with other activists. &ldquo;Every time the winter is rainy and there&rsquo;s no snow, I get really upset,&rdquo; said Berfond. &ldquo;I talked about that in a Sunrise meeting recently &mdash; how I remembered winters being different. And every person around my age said, &lsquo;Oh my god, I feel the same way.&rsquo;&rdquo; The discussion eased some of the burden. &ldquo;Saying &lsquo;I&rsquo;m scared&rsquo; publicly is cathartic,&rdquo; said Berfond.</p>\n<p>But there are limits to the uplift. &ldquo;The reality is that the climate crisis is really depressing,&rdquo; said Oli Tierney, a 17-year-old climate activist in Louisville, Kentucky. Tierney has found that urging lawmakers to do something about the crisis has eased her feelings of helplessness. But nothing can shake her worry about her mother and grandfather, who both have disabilities and live in a coastal area of the Philippines that has already been hit by storms.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what will happen to them,&rdquo; said Tierney. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing that brings me to tears when I participate in actions. Every time I get ignored by politicians, I feel like I&rsquo;m failing them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tierney was thinking about her mother and grandfather when she and other young Kentuckians stormed Senate Majority Leader <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/25/politics/sunrise-movement-mcconnell-protests/index.html\">Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s</a> office last month to demand climate action. She was already facing possible suspension from school for skipping part of a class to attend a planning meeting for the protest. And then security guards told the protesters that if they didn&rsquo;t leave, they would be arrested.</p>\n<p>Tierney left &mdash; in tears. But girded by her fellow activists and her conviction that someone needs to call attention to the environmental catastrophe the adults around her are ignoring, she spent much of the next few weeks planning Friday&rsquo;s walkout.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They think threatening us with arrest and suspension will stop us, but it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tierney. &ldquo;The climate crisis is way more frightening than that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Wait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn&rsquo;t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren&rsquo;t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet.

Marcela Mulholland, a senior at the University of Florida, grew up in South Florida and has experienced the ravages of flooding, storms, and rising temperatures firsthand. \u201cI was drawn to this work because of a deep sense of pain,\u201d said Mulholland.\nBut over the past year, as she\u2019s begun to volunteer with the Sunrise Movement, Mulholland has experienced a dramatic emotional shift. \u201cI\u2019ve found that there are other people who feel just as depressed and sad about it and are choosing to do something about these problems,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has been no better antidote to despair and hopelessness than finding the other people who feel as I do and working with them to fix what is breaking our hearts.\u201d\nClimate change is causing mental anguish in people of all ages, according to Lise Van Susteren, a psychiatrist and member of the Climate Psychiatry Alliance. \u201cWhen you\u2019re hearing day in and day out that we\u2019ve got 12 years, we\u2019ve got 11 years, the oceans are collapsing, fires are burning, air quality is terrible, wear a mask, the anxiety is inescapable,\u201d said Van Susteren. \u201cIt sticks itself into dark crevices in your brain.\u201d For kids, she said, there\u2019s often an added emotional layer of feeling betrayed by the older generation\u2019s inaction.\nJustine Berfond, a 22-year-old who lives in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, agrees. \u201cThe tough thing is when the adults in our lives are like, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d said Berfond, a senior at New York University. \u201cThey have good intentions. It\u2019s like when you think there\u2019s a monster under the bed when you\u2019re little, and they tell you you don\u2019t have to worry about it. But in this case, the monster is real.\u201d\nBerfond, who has been terrified about climate change since elementary school, has found relief in sharing some of the anxieties she used to keep to herself with other activists. \u201cEvery time the winter is rainy and there\u2019s no snow, I get really upset,\u201d said Berfond. \u201cI talked about that in a Sunrise meeting recently \u2014 how I remembered winters being different. And every person around my age said, \u2018Oh my god, I feel the same way.\u2019\u201d The discussion eased some of the burden. \u201cSaying \u2018I\u2019m scared\u2019 publicly is cathartic,\u201d said Berfond.\nBut there are limits to the uplift. \u201cThe reality is that the climate crisis is really depressing,\u201d said Oli Tierney, a 17-year-old climate activist in Louisville, Kentucky. Tierney has found that urging lawmakers to do something about the crisis has eased her feelings of helplessness. But nothing can shake her worry about her mother and grandfather, who both have disabilities and live in a coastal area of the Philippines that has already been hit by storms.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen to them,\u201d said Tierney. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that brings me to tears when I participate in actions. Every time I get ignored by politicians, I feel like I\u2019m failing them.\u201d\nTierney was thinking about her mother and grandfather when she and other young Kentuckians stormed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office last month to demand climate action. She was already facing possible suspension from school for skipping part of a class to attend a planning meeting for the protest. And then security guards told the protesters that if they didn\u2019t leave, they would be arrested.\nTierney left \u2014 in tears. But girded by her fellow activists and her conviction that someone needs to call attention to the environmental catastrophe the adults around her are ignoring, she spent much of the next few weeks planning Friday\u2019s walkout.\n\u201cThey think threatening us with arrest and suspension will stop us, but it won\u2019t,\u201d said Tierney. \u201cThe climate crisis is way more frightening than that.\u201d\nWait!

                "html": "<p><u>There is perhaps</u> no foreign leader more in tune with Donald Trump than Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Both men are unscripted, uninformed, and unburdened by the truth; they&rsquo;ve whipped up devoted mass followings by breaking with conventions and using direct, simple language to <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/10/28/jair-bolsonaro-elected-president-brazil/\">preach a message</a> of <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/16/brazil-bolsonaro-indigenous-land/\">violence</a>, hatred, victimhood, right-wing culture war, anti-science, and &ldquo;anti-globalism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro has difficulty staying on script in person, despite a proclivity for putting his foot in his mouth, and he loves to use Twitter to belittle and attack enemies, decry &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; even when the reporting is demonstrably true, and praise right-wing torturers and dictators. Sound familiar?</p>\n<p>It is unsurprising, therefore, that Bolsonaro, who took office in January, insisted that his first visit to a foreign capital be Washington, D.C., and Trump was eager to oblige. On Tuesday, the two men are scheduled to meet at the White House and have lunch (there was not enough time to arrange a full state visit).</p>\n<p>The far-right leaders are expected to discuss <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/01/30/donald-trump-and-the-yankee-plot-to-overthrow-the-venezuelan-government/\">the push to oust Venezuela President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro</a>, economic and trade cooperation, Brazil&rsquo;s bid to enter the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and sign a deal to allow <a href=\"https://brazilian.report/money/2019/03/11/brazil-usa-alcantara-space-station/\">U.S. rocket launches from a Brazilian base</a>.</p>\n<p>For the U.S., Venezuela is the key issue, while the Brazilians are more focused on economic accords. The trip is meant to signal strengthened ties between two ideological allies, but the practical results will likely be limited.</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro&rsquo;s team hopes to leave the meeting with multiple major signed agreements, but due to the rushed nature of the preparations, that seems unlikely. Bolsonaro <a href=\"https://istoe.com.br/bolsonaro-confirma-acordo-com-eua-sobre-base-de-alcantara/\">confirmed</a> in a livestream that the two countries will sign an agreement almost 20 years in the making to permit the U.S. to launch satellites and rockets into space from Brazil&rsquo;s Alc&acirc;ntara Launch Center without sharing U.S. intellectual property. Its location near the equator would allow for rocket launches to use 30 percent less fuel. The deal had stalled over national sovereignty concerns.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Rocket launch tower at Alc\u00e2ntara Launch Center (CLA) in Alcantara, Maranhao State, Brazil, on September 14, 2018. - The CLA is a satellite launching facility of the Brazilian Space Agency and is operated by the Brazilian Air Force. The CLA is the closest launching base to the equator. There are also plans to launch several international rockets from Alc\u00e2ntara. In the beginning of 2018, Brazilian government offered the possibility to use the spaceport to several U.S. companies.

The delegation also expects to sign minor accords on exchanges between the Brazilian Federal Police and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as well as NASA and the Brazilian Space Agency. They plan to announce their intention to create a $100 million fund for small businesses operating in the Amazon region and establish working groups to study the reduction of trade barriers.</p>\n<p>The U.S. is <a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/trump-deve-frustrar-pauta-economica-de-bolsonaro-em-viagem-aos-eua.shtml\">not expected</a> to back Brazil&rsquo;s bid to join the OECD, a Brazilian priority. Nor do they plan to sign a bilateral agreement to grant expedited customs processing for select operators, Brazil&rsquo;s inclusion in the Global Entry border fast-lane program, or reach an agreement to open the U.S. market to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-agriculture/brazil-confident-in-talks-to-reopen-us-market-for-brazil-beef-minister-idUSE6N1XC05G\">Brazilian beef exports</a>. The Brazilians are considering the <a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/03/brasil-deve-derrubar-barreiras-para-importacao-de-trigo-dos-eua.shtml\">reduction of tariffs</a> on U.S. wheat and <a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/01/brasil-planeja-eliminar-necessidade-de-visto-para-americanos-diz-ministro.shtml\">scrapping</a> the requirement of tourist visas for U.S. citizens.</p>\n<p>This is Bolsonaro&rsquo;s second trip abroad as president; he was widely criticized for a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/01/23/brazils-new-president-fizzles-his-overseas-debut/?utm_term=.f7d1d5ef227c\">weak showing</a> on his first trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Later this month, he will travel to Chile and Israel, just days before their legislative elections.</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro is far more popular than his most recent predecessors, but his domestic approval ratings have <a href=\"https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2019/02/26/pesquisa-cnt-mda-aprovacao-governo-bolsonaro.htm\">dipped</a> to 39 percent as internal squabbling, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/22/jair-bolsonaro-presidency-brazil/\">strategic missteps</a>, and a series of <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/12/09/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-cabinet/\">corruption scandals</a> have quickly usurped his <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/10/05/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-election-stabbinng/\">campaign</a> narrative of a disciplined, moral leader untainted by the corruption that plagues the capital.</p>\n<p>The trip may grant him a momentary reprieve from the <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/22/jair-bolsonaro-presidency-brazil/\">countless crises</a> &mdash; many of his own making &mdash; that continue to encircle him in Bras&iacute;lia. At the White House, Bolsonaro will get to mug for the cameras with Trump, whom he&rsquo;s already referred to as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/10/1925626-o-trump-serve-de-exemplo-para-mim-diz-bolsonaro-em-visita-aos-eua.shtml\">an example</a>&rdquo; and never misses a chance to publicly flatter. But in the end, his political future hinges on dragging the economy out of years of languor, though recent economic indicators have been ticking down alongside his popularity.</p>\n<p>His administration&rsquo;s strategy on that front is to push through wildly unpopular austerity measures to roll out the red carpet for <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/10/25/brazil-election-jair-bolsonaro-us-investors/\">foreign investment</a>, particularly from the United States. The visit is designed to signal positive steps in that direction, even if it is unlikely to produce any substantial breakthroughs.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"O presidente Jair Bolsonaro durante encontro com o autoproclamado presidente interino da Venezuela, Juan Guaid\u00f3, no Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto.\" src=\"https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/03/Jair-Bolsonaro-Juan-Guaido-Venezuela-1552923762.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90\"></img><figcaption>Bolsonaro shakes hands with the president of Venezuela&rsquo;s National Assembly, Juan Guaid&oacute;, at the Planalto Palace in the Brazilian capital, Bras&iacute;lia, on Feb. 28, 2019.

The U.S.-Brazilian bilateral trade relationship has been rocky for years, particularly under the 13 years of Workers&rsquo; Party administrations that sought to contain U.S. influence in the hemisphere. Grudges remain.</p>\n<p>However, Trump&rsquo;s main concern in the region at the moment is <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/13/neoliberalism-or-death-the-u-s-economic-war-against-venezuela/\">Venezuela</a>. After launching a risky <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/20/regime-change-we-can-believe-in-the-u-s-agenda-in-venezuela-haiti-and-egypt/\">regime change campaign</a> against Maduro in January, the administration and its allies have little to show for it except a string of failures. The threat of military intervention is still officially on the table, but increasingly appears to be a bluff as allies have backed away from that rhetoric, but the U.S. has tightened economic <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/venezuela-us-sanctions-united-nations-oil-pdvsa-a8748201.html\">sanctions</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There will be an expectation on the American side that Bolsonaro can show that he is truly committed to ramping up the pressure&rdquo; on Maduro, says Matias Spektor, associate professor of international relations at the Get&uacute;lio Vargas Foundation. &ldquo;No one in Washington expects Brazil to intervene&rdquo; militarily, says Spektor, &ldquo;what they&rsquo;re asking for is ramping up the diplomatic pressure,&rdquo; including the implementation of economic sanctions of their own against Venezuela. In an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbf584ba-435f-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3\">interview</a> to the Financial Times last week, Vice President Hamilton Mour&atilde;o said &ldquo;the political pressure is there,&rdquo; but &ldquo;economic pressure&rdquo; from Brazil would have limited impact since Venezuelan officials who might be targeted &ldquo;don&rsquo;t have their assets [in Brazil].&rdquo; Mour&atilde;o is a former general and represents the line of thinking of the Brazilian military, which has been a moderating force on the issue, a counterbalance to Foreign Minister Ernesto Ara&uacute;jo&rsquo;s more aggressive posture.</p>\n<h3>Rifts Within the Bolsonaro Coalition</h3>\n<p>The Venezuela crisis is one of many recent episodes that have laid bare the divisions within the Bolsonaro administration, which roughly shakes out into four main groups: military, evangelicals, old guard conservative politicians, and new far-right outsiders loyal to their pseudo-intellectual, conspiracy theory-peddling guru Olavo de Carvalho.</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro, a former army captain, embodies shades of each group. When it came to cabinet posts and top advisory positions, he has favored the military faction, loading his administration with generals. But his rhetoric and the actions of his sons &mdash; a Rio city council member, a federal deputy, and a federal senator &mdash; who have significant influence over their father, tend toward the Carvalho camp. Carvalho has <a href=\"https://noticias.uol.com.br/ciencia/ultimas-noticias/redacao/2019/01/09/o-que-a-ciencia-diz-sobre-a-terra-ser-o-centro-do-universo.htm\">publicly questioned</a> whether the Earth revolves around the sun. On Saturday, he made <a href=\"https://www.valor.com.br/politica/6164073/para-olavo-de-carvalho-se-nao-mudar-governo-acaba-em-seis-meses\">comments</a> that were sharply critical of the military&rsquo;s role in the administration: &ldquo;If everything continues as it is, it is already bad. You do not have to change anything to be bad. Just keep it up. In six months, it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While the military, old guard conservatives, and evangelicals tend to hew toward a more protectionist and incrementalist view of foreign policy, the new far right has a strong ideological vision that wants to radically break with tradition in ways that often put them shoulder to shoulder with Trump.</p>\n<p>This contingent is well-represented in Bolsonaro&rsquo;s delegation. They arranged for the first item on the president&rsquo;s agenda to be a dinner party at the ambassador&rsquo;s residence last Sunday and invited former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Carvalho as honored guests. Attendees <a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/bolsonaro-tera-santa-ceia-com-direita-nos-eua.shtml\">also included</a> Mary Anastasia O&rsquo;Grady, a Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s editorial board member; right-wing social commentator Roger Kimball, who endorsed both Trump and Bolsonaro and has written critically about political correctness; <a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/em-santa-ceia-da-direita-bolsonaro-diz-que-comunismo-nao-pode-imperar.shtml\">and</a> Matt Schlapp, chair of the lobbying organization that hosts the annual Conservative Political Action Conference.</p>\n<p>Bannon was once the vice president of Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-evidence-emerges-of-steve-bannon-and-cambridge-analyticas-role-in-brexit\">company</a> that controversially used psychological profiling to target swing voters on social media with &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; in the 2016 presidential election on behalf of Trump and in favor of the Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom. The company&rsquo;s activities <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/facebook-data-deals-investigation.html\">remain under investigation</a> by the U.S. Justice Department. Bolsonaro&rsquo;s campaign relentlessly deployed its own &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; on social media and WhatsApp. The Folha de S&atilde;o Paulo newspaper also <a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/empresarios-bancam-campanha-contra-o-pt-pelo-whatsapp.shtml\">revealed</a> that wealthy supporters spent millions of dollars to disseminate &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; on Bolsonaro&rsquo;s behalf during the election in violation of campaign finance laws.</p>\n<p>Bannon&rsquo;s international far-right alliance called The Movement <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/steve-bannon-welcomes-eduardo-bolsonaro-as-head-of-the-movement-in-south-america-2019-02-02\">named</a> Congressperson Eduardo Bolsonaro as its South American representative last month. Eduardo was also recently a guest at an event at Mar-a-Lago hosted by Toni Kramer, founder of the group &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/politics/a15543254/trumpettes-mar-a-lago-party/\">Trumpettes USA</a>&rdquo; and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bolsonarosp/status/1099537111890432000?lang=en\">snapped photos</a> with Trump&rsquo;s son Eric and prominent Trump backers.</p>\n<p>Ara&uacute;jo, for his part, is also a fervent disciple of the conspiracy theorist Carvalho and an admirer of Trump. The <a href=\"https://www.metapoliticabrasil.com/about\">&ldquo;about the author&rdquo; section</a> of his blog reads:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I want to help Brazil and the world free themselves from globalist ideology. Globalism is economic globalization that has come to be piloted by cultural Marxism. Essentially it is an anti-human and anti-Christian system. Faith in Christ means today to fight against globalism, whose ultimate goal is to break the connection between God and man, make man a slave and God irrelevant.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/a-novos-diplomatas-araujo-diz-que-pais-nao-vendera-alma-para-exportar-minerio-de-ferro-e-soja.shtml\">recent speech</a>, he criticized policy positions that he believes permitted China to surpass the U.S. as Brazil&rsquo;s largest trade partner, blaming the new dynamic for the country&rsquo;s economic stagnation. He said Brazil &ldquo;will not sell its soul&rdquo; to export soy and iron. Ara&uacute;jo also claimed responsibility for instigating the current quagmire in Venezuela in a <a href=\"https://www.metapoliticabrasil.com/blog/contra-o-consenso-da-ina%C3%A7%C3%A3o\">recent blog post</a>, &ldquo;It was not Brazil that followed the U.S.A., but rather the opposite.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The military brass in Bolsonaro&rsquo;s inner circle have, with considerable success, moderated the administration&rsquo;s foreign policy. They were able to nix a plan publicly endorsed by Ara&uacute;jo and Bolsonaro to permit a U.S. military base on Brazilian soil, moderate the stance on Venezuela, and get Bolsonaro to walk back his plan to pull out of the Paris climate accords. They are also attempting to prevent Bolsonaro from <a href=\"https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/mourao-diz-que-por-ora-brasil-nao-pensa-em-mudar-embaixada-para-jerusalem-23408864\">moving the embassy</a> in Israel to Jerusalem. Yet Ara&uacute;jo is very much a true believer in the cause and, by all accounts, enjoys enormous prestige in the eyes of the president &mdash; and his sons as well. None of them appear to be going away anytime soon. This trip to Washington therefore can be seen as something of a counter volley by the most extremist, far-right element of Bolsonaro&rsquo;s coalition after a string of defeats to the moderates in the ongoing war to determine the course of the administration.</p>\n<p>Wait!

                "text": "There is perhaps no foreign leader more in tune with Donald Trump than Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Both men are unscripted, uninformed, and unburdened by the truth; they\u2019ve whipped up devoted mass followings by breaking with conventions and using direct, simple language to preach a message of violence, hatred, victimhood, right-wing culture war, anti-science, and \u201canti-globalism.\u201d\nBolsonaro has difficulty staying on script in person, despite a proclivity for putting his foot in his mouth, and he loves to use Twitter to belittle and attack enemies, decry \u201cfake news\u201d even when the reporting is demonstrably true, and praise right-wing torturers and dictators. Sound familiar?\nIt is unsurprising, therefore, that Bolsonaro, who took office in January, insisted that his first visit to a foreign capital be Washington, D.C., and Trump was eager to oblige. On Tuesday, the two men are scheduled to meet at the White House and have lunch (there was not enough time to arrange a full state visit).\nThe far-right leaders are expected to discuss the push to oust Venezuela President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, economic and trade cooperation, Brazil\u2019s bid to enter the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and sign a deal to allow U.S. rocket launches from a Brazilian base.\nFor the U.S., Venezuela is the key issue, while the Brazilians are more focused on economic accords. The trip is meant to signal strengthened ties between two ideological allies, but the practical results will likely be limited.\nBolsonaro\u2019s team hopes to leave the meeting with multiple major signed agreements, but due to the rushed nature of the preparations, that seems unlikely. Bolsonaro confirmed in a livestream that the two countries will sign an agreement almost 20 years in the making to permit the U.S. to launch satellites and rockets into space from Brazil\u2019s Alc\u00e2ntara Launch Center without sharing U.S. intellectual property. Its location near the equator would allow for rocket launches to use 30 percent less fuel. The deal had stalled over national sovereignty concerns.\nPhoto: Evaristo Sa/AFP/Getty Images\nAccording to a Brazilian diplomat involved in the negotiations who is prohibited from discussing them publicly, the Alc\u00e2ntara deal will likely be the only major achievement. The delegation also expects to sign minor accords on exchanges between the Brazilian Federal Police and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, as well as NASA and the Brazilian Space Agency. They plan to announce their intention to create a $100 million fund for small businesses operating in the Amazon region and establish working groups to study the reduction of trade barriers.\nThe U.S. is not expected to back Brazil\u2019s bid to join the OECD, a Brazilian priority. Nor do they plan to sign a bilateral agreement to grant expedited customs processing for select operators, Brazil\u2019s inclusion in the Global Entry border fast-lane program, or reach an agreement to open the U.S. market to Brazilian beef exports. The Brazilians are considering the reduction of tariffs on U.S. wheat and scrapping the requirement of tourist visas for U.S. citizens.\nThis is Bolsonaro\u2019s second trip abroad as president; he was widely criticized for a weak showing on his first trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Later this month, he will travel to Chile and Israel, just days before their legislative elections.\nBolsonaro is far more popular than his most recent predecessors, but his domestic approval ratings have dipped to 39 percent as internal squabbling, strategic missteps, and a series of corruption scandals have quickly usurped his campaign narrative of a disciplined, moral leader untainted by the corruption that plagues the capital.\nThe trip may grant him a momentary reprieve from the countless crises \u2014 many of his own making \u2014 that continue to encircle him in Bras\u00edlia. At the White House, Bolsonaro will get to mug for the cameras with Trump, whom he\u2019s already referred to as \u201can example\u201d and never misses a chance to publicly flatter. But in the end, his political future hinges on dragging the economy out of years of languor, though recent economic indicators have been ticking down alongside his popularity.\nHis administration\u2019s strategy on that front is to push through wildly unpopular austerity measures to roll out the red carpet for foreign investment, particularly from the United States. The visit is designed to signal positive steps in that direction, even if it is unlikely to produce any substantial breakthroughs.\nPhoto: Antonio Cruz/Ag\u00eancia Brasil\nTrump Wants Help With Venezuela\nTrump, for his part, has made it clear that he wants to support his new ideological ally, despite some misgivings within the administrative ranks. The U.S.-Brazilian bilateral trade relationship has been rocky for years, particularly under the 13 years of Workers\u2019 Party administrations that sought to contain U.S. influence in the hemisphere. Grudges remain.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s main concern in the region at the moment is Venezuela. After launching a risky regime change campaign against Maduro in January, the administration and its allies have little to show for it except a string of failures. The threat of military intervention is still officially on the table, but increasingly appears to be a bluff as allies have backed away from that rhetoric, but the U.S. has tightened economic sanctions.\n\u201cThere will be an expectation on the American side that Bolsonaro can show that he is truly committed to ramping up the pressure\u201d on Maduro, says Matias Spektor, associate professor of international relations at the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation. \u201cNo one in Washington expects Brazil to intervene\u201d militarily, says Spektor, \u201cwhat they\u2019re asking for is ramping up the diplomatic pressure,\u201d including the implementation of economic sanctions of their own against Venezuela. In an interview to the Financial Times last week, Vice President Hamilton Mour\u00e3o said \u201cthe political pressure is there,\u201d but \u201ceconomic pressure\u201d from Brazil would have limited impact since Venezuelan officials who might be targeted \u201cdon\u2019t have their assets [in Brazil].\u201d Mour\u00e3o is a former general and represents the line of thinking of the Brazilian military, which has been a moderating force on the issue, a counterbalance to Foreign Minister Ernesto Ara\u00fajo\u2019s more aggressive posture.\nRifts Within the Bolsonaro Coalition\nThe Venezuela crisis is one of many recent episodes that have laid bare the divisions within the Bolsonaro administration, which roughly shakes out into four main groups: military, evangelicals, old guard conservative politicians, and new far-right outsiders loyal to their pseudo-intellectual, conspiracy theory-peddling guru Olavo de Carvalho.\nBolsonaro, a former army captain, embodies shades of each group. When it came to cabinet posts and top advisory positions, he has favored the military faction, loading his administration with generals. But his rhetoric and the actions of his sons \u2014 a Rio city council member, a federal deputy, and a federal senator \u2014 who have significant influence over their father, tend toward the Carvalho camp. Carvalho has publicly questioned whether the Earth revolves around the sun. On Saturday, he made comments that were sharply critical of the military\u2019s role in the administration: \u201cIf everything continues as it is, it is already bad. You do not have to change anything to be bad. Just keep it up. In six months, it\u2019s over.\u201d\nWhile the military, old guard conservatives, and evangelicals tend to hew toward a more protectionist and incrementalist view of foreign policy, the new far right has a strong ideological vision that wants to radically break with tradition in ways that often put them shoulder to shoulder with Trump.\nThis contingent is well-represented in Bolsonaro\u2019s delegation. They arranged for the first item on the president\u2019s agenda to be a dinner party at the ambassador\u2019s residence last Sunday and invited former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Carvalho as honored guests. Attendees also included Mary Anastasia O\u2019Grady, a Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board member; right-wing social commentator Roger Kimball, who endorsed both Trump and Bolsonaro and has written critically about political correctness; and Matt Schlapp, chair of the lobbying organization that hosts the annual Conservative Political Action Conference.\nBannon was once the vice president of Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct company that controversially used psychological profiling to target swing voters on social media with \u201cfake news\u201d in the 2016 presidential election on behalf of Trump and in favor of the Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom. The company\u2019s activities remain under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. Bolsonaro\u2019s campaign relentlessly deployed its own \u201cfake news\u201d on social media and WhatsApp. The Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper also revealed that wealthy supporters spent millions of dollars to disseminate \u201cfake news\u201d on Bolsonaro\u2019s behalf during the election in violation of campaign finance laws.\nBannon\u2019s international far-right alliance called The Movement named Congressperson Eduardo Bolsonaro as its South American representative last month. Eduardo was also recently a guest at an event at Mar-a-Lago hosted by Toni Kramer, founder of the group \u201cTrumpettes USA\u201d and snapped photos with Trump\u2019s son Eric and prominent Trump backers.\nAra\u00fajo, for his part, is also a fervent disciple of the conspiracy theorist Carvalho and an admirer of Trump. The \u201cabout the author\u201d section of his blog reads:\nI want to help Brazil and the world free themselves from globalist ideology. Globalism is economic globalization that has come to be piloted by cultural Marxism. Essentially it is an anti-human and anti-Christian system. Faith in Christ means today to fight against globalism, whose ultimate goal is to break the connection between God and man, make man a slave and God irrelevant.\nIn a recent speech, he criticized policy positions that he believes permitted China to surpass the U.S. as Brazil\u2019s largest trade partner, blaming the new dynamic for the country\u2019s economic stagnation. He said Brazil \u201cwill not sell its soul\u201d to export soy and iron. Ara\u00fajo also claimed responsibility for instigating the current quagmire in Venezuela in a recent blog post, \u201cIt was not Brazil that followed the U.S.A., but rather the opposite.\u201d\nThe military brass in Bolsonaro\u2019s inner circle have, with considerable success, moderated the administration\u2019s foreign policy. They were able to nix a plan publicly endorsed by Ara\u00fajo and Bolsonaro to permit a U.S. military base on Brazilian soil, moderate the stance on Venezuela, and get Bolsonaro to walk back his plan to pull out of the Paris climate accords. They are also attempting to prevent Bolsonaro from moving the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Yet Ara\u00fajo is very much a true believer in the cause and, by all accounts, enjoys enormous prestige in the eyes of the president \u2014 and his sons as well. None of them appear to be going away anytime soon. This trip to Washington therefore can be seen as something of a counter volley by the most extremist, far-right element of Bolsonaro\u2019s coalition after a string of defeats to the moderates in the ongoing war to determine the course of the administration.\nWait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn\u2019t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren\u2019t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don\u2019t have ads, so we depend on our members \u2014 35,000 and counting \u2014 to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn\u2019t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month. That\u2019s all it takes to support the journalism you rely on.",

Before livestreaming his massacre of Muslim worshipers, he composed a lengthy document that proudly advocates the murder of innocent people in the name of racial purity. The manifesto is predictably disturbing. It is the work of a nihilist who sees a world so bleak and hopeless that it could be improved through acts of mass murder.

There have been calls to simply ignore what Tarrant wrote. While understandable, it is naive to think that ignoring people like him will make their demands go away.

He approvingly cites the deterrent effect of killing their children.</p>\n<p>For those wondering where Tarrant was radicalized, the answer is right out in the open. It is in our media and politics, where minorities, Muslims or otherwise, are <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/03/15/new-zealand-shooter-manifesto/\">vilified</a> as a matter of course. Tarrant&rsquo;s beliefs reached a violent praxis that I assume many of his fellow travelers would find hard to stomach. But his claims about disastrous birthrates and floods of immigrant invaders are practically banal at this point. Such rhetoric animates the policies of Donald Trump, who has revived a medieval response to &ldquo;invaders,&rdquo; promising to contain them behind a giant wall. It comes from the president&rsquo;s political supporters who openly <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iowa-rep-steve-king-austria-white-nationalist_us_5bca4851e4b0a8f17eec6001\">espouse</a> the same &ldquo;Great Replacement&rdquo; theory that motivated Tarrant&rsquo;s massacre.</p>\n<p>This rhetoric about foreign pollution also emanates from the mouths and pens of supposedly liberal public figures. In 2006, the &ldquo;New Atheist&rdquo; writer Sam Harris wrote an <a href=\"https://www.truthdig.com/articles/sam-harris-on-the-reality-of-islam/\">article</a> claiming that within 25 years, France was on course to have a majority-Muslim population, even if immigration were to stop tomorrow. This demographic shift would mean nothing less than an end to democracy itself, he argued. (Harris did not deem it necessary to provide a citation for his ludicrous population projections.) Tarrant&rsquo;s manifesto reads like a shortened, albeit more violent, version of the popular 2017 book &ldquo;<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/12/25/strange-death-of-europe-douglas-murray-review/\">The Death of Europe</a>,&rdquo; by British author Douglas Murray, who argued that immigration had already effectively destroyed European society.</p>\n<p>In short, Tarrant&rsquo;s writings reflect a worldview that is not just confined to the dark corners of the internet, but is openly expressed in media and politics. His alleged actions are the logical conclusion to the rhetoric of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38688507\">American Carnage</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Death of Europe&rdquo; promoted by prominent figures across the globe.</p>\n<p><u>Tarrant writes that</u> his breaking point came while traveling through France. There, he was overwhelmed by the number of &ldquo;invaders,&rdquo; whose black and brown faces he encountered in every city and town. Judging from his words, he didn&rsquo;t pause to consider that most of these people were in fact not foreigners but the children of <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/23/france-islamophobia-islam-french-muslims-terrorism/\">people who have lived for several generations</a> in France. They are people who know no home but that country. Tarrant describes being overtaken by emotion when seeing a wartime cemetery, which he views as the resting place of a previous French generation that fought &ldquo;invaders.&rdquo; It apparently never occurred to him that the majority of the World War II-era Free French Army, which liberated France from the Nazis, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7984436.stm\">consisted mostly of black and North African colonial soldiers</a>. It is the descendants of these people whose presence caused Tarrant, an Australian tourist, such heartache that he, according to his manifesto, &ldquo;broke into tears, sobbing alone in the car.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote data-reactid=\"207\">To insist that they to &ldquo;go back&rdquo; to an imaginary homeland on a distant continent is to insist on genocide and ethnic cleansing.</blockquote>\n<p>As we consider the attacks in New Zealand, it is important to understand that Muslims are an easy target for racist violence. They are an unpopular minority in Western countries. Some analysts, even as they condemned Tarrant&rsquo;s alleged, murders, <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-analyst-on-new-zealand-shooting-its-very-understandable-what-the-shooter-was-trying-to-do-on-a-political-level\">expressed sympathy</a> with his reasoning about Muslims. This reaction seems to be exactly what Tarrant was counting on. In one section of his manifesto, he makes clear that all &ldquo;high fertility immigrants&rdquo; are the enemy, but that he chose to target Muslims because, &ldquo;they are the most despised group of invaders in the West, attacking them receives the greatest level of support.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Killing Muslims is only the first stage in the plan he lays out, however. The ultimate goal is changing the demographic makeup of Western countries through a more general program of ethnic cleansing that also targets blacks, Jews, and Asians. &ldquo;The invaders must be removed from European soil, regardless from where they came or when they came. Roma, African, Indian, Turkish, Semitic or other,&rdquo; Tarrant writes. Among his stated influences are the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik and Dylann Roof, who murdered nine African-American parishioners at a South Carolina church. Tarrant makes clear that he is not a Christian in any religious sense. His only consistent belief is a genocidal intention to remove the &ldquo;other,&rdquo; whether by murder or expulsion.</p>\n<p>Though he acted alone, Tarrant ominously claims in his manifesto to have received blessing for his attack from a clandestine far-right organization. Sympathizers with his motives exist in huge numbers, he writes, including in the military and police apparatuses of Western states. So far, no evidence has emerged to corroborate this claim, but looking at the <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/white-nationalists-military-identity-evropa_n_5c8ab70ae4b0d7f6b0f1094b\">news</a>, it <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-nazis/dozens-of-neo-nazis-serving-in-german-police-army-der-spiegel-idUSKBN1HR2GO\">seems</a> entirely <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/01/31/the-fbi-has-quietly-investigated-white-supremacist-infiltration-of-law-enforcement/\">plausible</a>.</p>\n<p>In his writings, Tarrant makes clear that he has no problems with Muslims who live in their own homelands, nor with Jews, as long as they live in Israel. He simply wants them out of the West. &ldquo;How they are removed is irrelevant, peacefully, forcefully, happily, violently or diplomatically. They must be removed,&rdquo; he writes. It is unlikely, of course, that these people will leave their homes voluntarily. The United States and Europe are where they raise their families, pay taxes, attend schools, and contribute their labor to society. To insist that they to &ldquo;go back&rdquo; to an imaginary homeland on a distant continent, therefore, is to insist on genocide and ethnic cleansing.</p>\n<p>When faced with such an implacable and fanatic demand, it is important to take it seriously. I fear there will be more men like Brenton Tarrant, Anders Breivik, and accused Pittsburgh synagogue shooter Robert Bowers, particularly while those in power respond to their messages with a wink and a nod. In the face of such an enemy &mdash; that demands that one literally abolish oneself &mdash; the comforting idea of compromise evaporates. Racist attacks have continued since the New Zealand killings, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/surrey-terrorism-incident-teenager-attacked-baseball-bat-knife-stanwell-police-a8827361.html\">including a number</a> of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-47612086\">violent assaults</a>. In the face of this reality and the struggles ahead, it seems important to recall a popular Jewish mantra in the face of Nazi oppression, which carries renewed meaning today: &ldquo;We will outlive them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Wait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn&rsquo;t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren&rsquo;t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don&rsquo;t have ads, so we depend on our members &mdash; 35,000 and counting &mdash; to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn&rsquo;t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month. That&rsquo;s all it takes to support the journalism you rely on.</p>",

They are an unpopular minority in Western countries. Some analysts, even as they condemned Tarrant\u2019s alleged, murders, expressed sympathy with his reasoning about Muslims. This reaction seems to be exactly what Tarrant was counting on. In one section of his manifesto, he makes clear that all \u201chigh fertility immigrants\u201d are the enemy, but that he chose to target Muslims because, \u201cthey are the most despised group of invaders in the West, attacking them receives the greatest level of support.\u201d\nKilling Muslims is only the first stage in the plan he lays out, however. The ultimate goal is changing the demographic makeup of Western countries through a more general program of ethnic cleansing that also targets blacks, Jews, and Asians. \u201cThe invaders must be removed from European soil, regardless from where they came or when they came. Roma, African, Indian, Turkish, Semitic or other,\u201d Tarrant writes. Among his stated influences are the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik and Dylann Roof, who murdered nine African-American parishioners at a South Carolina church. Tarrant makes clear that he is not a Christian in any religious sense. His only consistent belief is a genocidal intention to remove the \u201cother,\u201d whether by murder or expulsion.\nThough he acted alone, Tarrant ominously claims in his manifesto to have received blessing for his attack from a clandestine far-right organization. Sympathizers with his motives exist in huge numbers, he writes, including in the military and police apparatuses of Western states. So far, no evidence has emerged to corroborate this claim, but looking at the news, it seems entirely plausible.\nIn his writings, Tarrant makes clear that he has no problems with Muslims who live in their own homelands, nor with Jews, as long as they live in Israel. He simply wants them out of the West. \u201cHow they are removed is irrelevant, peacefully, forcefully, happily, violently or diplomatically. They must be removed,\u201d he writes. It is unlikely, of course, that these people will leave their homes voluntarily. The United States and Europe are where they raise their families, pay taxes, attend schools, and contribute their labor to society. To insist that they to \u201cgo back\u201d to an imaginary homeland on a distant continent, therefore, is to insist on genocide and ethnic cleansing.\nWhen faced with such an implacable and fanatic demand, it is important to take it seriously. I fear there will be more men like Brenton Tarrant, Anders Breivik, and accused Pittsburgh synagogue shooter Robert Bowers, particularly while those in power respond to their messages with a wink and a nod. In the face of such an enemy \u2014 that demands that one literally abolish oneself \u2014 the comforting idea of compromise evaporates. Racist attacks have continued since the New Zealand killings, including a number of violent assaults. In the face of this reality and the struggles ahead, it seems important to recall a popular Jewish mantra in the face of Nazi oppression, which carries renewed meaning today: \u201cWe will outlive them.\u201d\nWait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn\u2019t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren\u2019t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet.

                "html": "<p><u>In Davenport, Iowa</u> this weekend, Sen. Cory Booker twice offered veiled criticism of the lighthearted way that two of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sens. Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders, have joked about their past use of marijuana.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-iSonSLVxzQ\">an interview with MSNBC</a> on Monday, Booker suggested that, while he was in favor of reforming the drug laws, the gross disparity in the way that rich and poor users are currently treated by the criminal justice system makes it no laughing matter. &ldquo;The privileged can break laws and not have to worry about it. There&rsquo;s no difference between blacks and whites for using marijuana, or even selling marijuana, but blacks are almost four times more likely to be convicted,&rdquo; Booker said.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-reactid=\"228\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-iSonSLVxzQ?autoplay=0&rel=0&enablejsapi=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Ftheintercept.com&widgetid=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;Now we have presidential candidates, senators, bragging about their pot use while there are kids who can&rsquo;t get a job because they have a nonviolent offense for doing things that two of the last three presidents did,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>While he declined to name them, both Harris and Sanders recently attracted attention for joking about their past use of the drug during interviews with &ldquo;The Breakfast Club,&rdquo; a nationally syndicated radio show.</p>\n<p>As the pro-legalization website Marijuana Moment <a href=\"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/cory-booker-appears-to-call-out-kamala-harriss-marijuana-jokes/\">first noted</a>, Booker made similar comments one day earlier, suggesting that he plans to use the issue against rivals who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/us/politics/marijuana-legalize-democrats.html\">both signed on as co-sponsors</a> last month when he introduced the<a href=\"https://www.booker.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=892\"> Marijuana Justice Act</a>, which would remove the drug from the federal list of controlled substances and expunge past convictions.</p>\n<p>Asked at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ABCNewsPolitics/videos/315869188956127/?sfnsw=cl\">a town hall discussion</a> on Sunday to explain his stance on the decriminalization of the drug, Booker adopted a somber tone and began by saying, &ldquo;a lot of people have a very different perspective on marijuana than I do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have presidential candidates and congresspeople and senators who now talk about their marijuana use almost as if it&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But meanwhile, in 2017, we had more arrests for marijuana possession in this country than all the violent crime arrests combined.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With a note of righteous indignation in his voice, Booker concluded: &ldquo;Do not talk to me about legalizing marijuana unless in the same breath you talk to me about expunging the records of millions of people that are suffering with not being able to find a job.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Booker, who says that <a href=\"https://youtu.be/t3GnanNmTvU\">he has never smoked pot</a> &mdash; in part because of an awareness instilled into him by his parents that, as a young black man, he could expect no mercy from the justice system &mdash; seems intent on using the lighthearted way Harris and Sanders discussed the issue to undermine them.</p>\n<p>The Harris and Sanders campaigns did not immediately reply to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Booker&rsquo;s Senate bill is also supported by Elizabeth Warren, who says she has <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elizabeth-warren-jeff-sessions-weed-legalization-states-act-715651/\">never smoked marijuana</a>, and Kirsten Gillibrand. The Democrat with the longest record of supporting legalization is former Rep. Beto O&rsquo;Rourke, who <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/03/13/beto-orourke-running-president-started-weed/\">sponsored an El Paso City Council resolution in 2009</a> calling for marijuana legalization and a conversation about legalizing all narcotics.</p>\n<p>Booker&rsquo;s comments were widely seen as a way for him to cast doubt on Harris&rsquo;s commitment to reform, given her <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a26576642/kamala-harris-weed-marijuana-complete-guide/\">recent change of heart</a> on the issue, and potentially question her <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html\">less than progressive record</a> as San Francisco&rsquo;s district attorney and then as California&rsquo;s attorney general.</p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\"><p>Here we go!

In 2010, a spokesperson for Harris explained that her position was based on her experience as a prosecutor. &ldquo;Spending two decades in courtrooms, Harris believes that drug-selling harms communities,&rdquo; her then-campaign manager Brian Brokaw said. &ldquo;Harris supports the legal use of medicinal marijuana but does not support anything beyond that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Last year, however, Booker had seemed glad to have Harris&rsquo;s support for his bill &mdash; and video from the time shows that he was already using the argument that &ldquo;congresspeople, senators, have admitted to using marijuana.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\"><p>The fact is?,? marijuana laws are not applied and enforced in the same way for all people.

                "text": "In Davenport, Iowa this weekend, Sen. Cory Booker twice offered veiled criticism of the lighthearted way that two of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sens. Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders, have joked about their past use of marijuana.\nIn an interview with MSNBC on Monday, Booker suggested that, while he was in favor of reforming the drug laws, the gross disparity in the way that rich and poor users are currently treated by the criminal justice system makes it no laughing matter. \u201cThe privileged can break laws and not have to worry about it. There\u2019s no difference between blacks and whites for using marijuana, or even selling marijuana, but blacks are almost four times more likely to be convicted,\u201d Booker said.\n\u201cNow we have presidential candidates, senators, bragging about their pot use while there are kids who can\u2019t get a job because they have a nonviolent offense for doing things that two of the last three presidents did,\u201d he added.\nWhile he declined to name them, both Harris and Sanders recently attracted attention for joking about their past use of the drug during interviews with \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d a nationally syndicated radio show.\nAs the pro-legalization website Marijuana Moment first noted, Booker made similar comments one day earlier, suggesting that he plans to use the issue against rivals who both signed on as co-sponsors last month when he introduced the Marijuana Justice Act, which would remove the drug from the federal list of controlled substances and expunge past convictions.\nAsked at a town hall discussion on Sunday to explain his stance on the decriminalization of the drug, Booker adopted a somber tone and began by saying, \u201ca lot of people have a very different perspective on marijuana than I do.\u201d\n\u201cWe have presidential candidates and congresspeople and senators who now talk about their marijuana use almost as if it\u2019s funny,\u201d he added. \u201cBut meanwhile, in 2017, we had more arrests for marijuana possession in this country than all the violent crime arrests combined.\u201d\nWith a note of righteous indignation in his voice, Booker concluded: \u201cDo not talk to me about legalizing marijuana unless in the same breath you talk to me about expunging the records of millions of people that are suffering with not being able to find a job.\u201d\nBooker, who says that he has never smoked pot \u2014 in part because of an awareness instilled into him by his parents that, as a young black man, he could expect no mercy from the justice system \u2014 seems intent on using the lighthearted way Harris and Sanders discussed the issue to undermine them.\nThe Harris and Sanders campaigns did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\nBooker\u2019s Senate bill is also supported by Elizabeth Warren, who says she has never smoked marijuana, and Kirsten Gillibrand. The Democrat with the longest record of supporting legalization is former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who sponsored an El Paso City Council resolution in 2009 calling for marijuana legalization and a conversation about legalizing all narcotics.\nBooker\u2019s comments were widely seen as a way for him to cast doubt on Harris\u2019s commitment to reform, given her recent change of heart on the issue, and potentially question her less than progressive record as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney and then as California\u2019s attorney general.\nHere we go! Now things are starting to get interesting.\nIn a little-noticed comment over the weekend, Cory Booker appeared to criticize the way rival presidential candidate Kamala Harris has treated the marijuana issue as a laughing matter.https://t.co/rEzYnx1O0K pic.twitter.com/00JqNoqowU\n\u2014 Tom Angell ??

Shots fired.\n\u2014 Dr Sheena Howard (@DrSheenaHoward) March 18, 2019\nHarris\u2019s peals of laughter on the radio when she replied to the questions of whether she supports the legalization of marijuana \u2014 \u201cHalf my family is from Jamaica, are you kidding me?\u201d \u2014 and whether she ever smoked pot \u2014 \u201cI have, and I did inhale\u201d \u2014 were criticized from both the right and the left, for seeming too flip to some and like part of an effort to conceal her past opposition to others.\nhttps://twitter.com/breakfastclubam/status/1094953059334176770/\nThe senator\u2019s Jamaica-born father, Donald Harris, was among those who criticized the tone of her remarks. \u201cMy dear departed grandmothers \u2026 as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their grave right now to see their family\u2019s name, reputation, and proud Jamaican identity being connected, in any way, jokingly or not with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics,\u201d he told Jamaica Global Online. \u201cSpeaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically dissociate ourselves from this travesty.\u201d\nBefore Harris came out in favor of marijuana legalization in 2018, when she endorsed an earlier measure introduced by Booker, she had opposed ballot initiatives to decriminalize recreational use in California. In 2010, a spokesperson for Harris explained that her position was based on her experience as a prosecutor. \u201cSpending two decades in courtrooms, Harris believes that drug-selling harms communities,\u201d her then-campaign manager Brian Brokaw said. \u201cHarris supports the legal use of medicinal marijuana but does not support anything beyond that.\u201d\nLast year, however, Booker had seemed glad to have Harris\u2019s support for his bill \u2014 and video from the time shows that he was already using the argument that \u201ccongresspeople, senators, have admitted to using marijuana.\u201d\nThe fact is?,? marijuana laws are not applied and enforced in the same way for all people. That\u2019s why I'?ve signed onto @CoryBooker\u2019s Marijuana Justice Act? to make marijuana legal at the federal level?. It\u2019s the smart thing to do?. pic.twitter.com/JD5qqm0bfU\n\u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) May 10, 2018\nThe comments by Sanders drew less attention, but he told the \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d hosts this month, \u201cI believe in the legalization of marijuana.\u201d When asked if he had ever smoked, he replied: \u201cFew times \u2014 didn\u2019t do a whole lot for me. My recollection is, I nearly coughed my brains out, so it\u2019s not my cup of tea.\u201d\nWait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn\u2019t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren\u2019t on the beat?

The <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/press-release/file/1153481/download\">charging document</a> and accompanying extradition request from the U.S. government, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metpoliceuk/status/1116302894259679233\">used by the U.K. police</a> to arrest Assange once Ecuador officially withdrew its asylum protection, seeks to criminalize numerous activities at the core of investigative journalism.</p>\n<p>So much of what has been reported today about this indictment has been false. Two facts in particular have been utterly distorted by the DOJ and then misreported by numerous media organizations.</p>\n<p>The first crucial fact about the indictment is that its key allegation &mdash; that Assange did not merely receive classified documents from Chelsea Manning but tried to help her crack a password in order to cover her tracks &mdash; is not new. It <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2011/12/defense-manning-was-overcharged-070787?paginate=false\">was long known</a> by the Obama DOJ and was explicitly part of Manning&rsquo;s trial, yet the Obama DOJ &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/opinion/sunday/if-donald-trump-targets-journalists-thank-obama.html\">not exactly renowned</a> for being stalwart guardians of press freedoms &mdash; concluded that it could not and should not prosecute Assange because indicting him would pose serious threats to press freedom. In sum, today&rsquo;s indictment contains <em>no new evidence or facts</em> about Assange&rsquo;s actions; all of it has been known for years.</p>\n<p>The other key fact being widely misreported is that the indictment accuses Assange of trying to help Manning obtain access to document databases to which she had no valid access: i.e., hacking rather than journalism. But the indictment alleges no such thing. Rather, it simply accuses Assange of trying to help Manning log into the Defense Department&rsquo;s computers using a different username so that she could maintain her anonymity while downloading documents in the public interest and then furnish them to WikiLeaks to publish.</p>\n<p>In other words, the indictment seeks to criminalize what journalists are not only permitted but ethically required to do: take steps to help their sources maintain their anonymity. As longtime Assange lawyer Barry Pollack <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Isikoff/status/1116343484552708098\">put it</a>: &ldquo;The factual allegations &hellip; boil down to encouraging a source to provide him information and taking efforts to protect the identity of that source. Journalists around the world should be deeply troubled by these unprecedented criminal charges.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why the indictment poses such a grave threat to press freedom. It characterizes as a felony many actions that journalists are not just permitted but required to take in order to conduct sensitive reporting in the digital age.</p>\n<p>But because the DOJ issued <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/wikileaks-founder-charged-computer-hacking-conspiracy\">a press release</a> with a headline that claimed that Assange was accused of &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; crimes, media outlets mindlessly repeated this claim <em>even though the indictment contains no such allegation</em>. It merely accuses Assange of trying to help Manning avoid detection. That&rsquo;s not &ldquo;hacking.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s called a core obligation of journalism.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/04/hackkk-1555027834.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/04/hackkk-1555027834.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&w=1024&h=743\"></img></a></figure>\n<p><u>The history of this case</u> is vital for understanding what actually happened today. The U.S. government has been determined to indict Julian Assange and WikiLeaks since at least 2010, when the group published hundreds of thousands of war logs and diplomatic cables <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2010/12/24/wikileaks_23/\">revealing numerous war crimes and other acts of corruption</a> by the U.S., the U.K., and other governments around the world. To achieve that goal, the Obama DOJ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/11/us-opens-wikileaks-grand-jury-hearing\">empaneled a grand jury in 2011</a> and conducted a sweeping investigation into WikiLeaks, Assange, and Manning.</p>\n<p>But in 2013, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/julian-assange-unlikely-to-face-us-charges-over-publishing-classified-documents/2013/11/25/dd27decc-55f1-11e3-8304-caf30787c0a9_story.html?utm_term=.a5ca2f419894\">Obama DOJ concluded that it could not prosecute</a> Assange in connection with the publication of those documents because there was no way to distinguish what WikiLeaks did from what the New York Times, The Guardian, and numerous media outlets around the world routinely do: namely, work with sources to publish classified documents.</p>\n<p>The Obama DOJ tried for years to find evidence to justify a claim that Assange did more than act as a journalist &mdash; that he, for instance, illegally worked with Manning to steal the documents &mdash; but found nothing to justify that accusation and thus, never indicted Assange (as noted, the Obama DOJ since at least 2011 was well-aware of the core allegation of today&rsquo;s indictment &mdash; that Assange tried to help Manning circumvent a password wall so she could use a different username &mdash; because <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/11/julian-assange-arrested-media-journalism-analysis-226650\">that was all part of Manning&rsquo;s charges</a>).</p>\n<p>So Obama ended eight years in office without indicting Assange or WikiLeaks. Everything regarding Assange&rsquo;s possible indictment changed only at the start of the Trump administration. Beginning in early 2017, the most reactionary Trump officials were determined to do what the Obama DOJ refused to do: indict Assange in connection with publication of the Manning documents.</p>\n<p>As the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/trump-administration-assange-wikileaks.html\">reported late last year</a>, &ldquo;Soon after he took over as C.I.A. director, [current Secretary of State] Mike Pompeo privately told lawmakers about a new target for American spies: Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks.&rdquo; The Times added that &ldquo;Mr. Pompeo and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions unleashed an aggressive campaign against Mr. Assange, reversing an Obama-era view of WikiLeaks as a journalistic entity.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/04/assangeeee-1555019797.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/04/assangeeee-1555019797.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&w=1024&h=899\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>In April, 2017, Pompeo, while still CIA chief, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/04/14/trumps-cia-director-pompeo-targeting-wikileaks-explicitly-threatens-speech-and-press-freedoms/\">delivered a deranged speech</a> proclaiming that &ldquo;we have to recognize that we can no longer allow Assange and his colleagues <em>the latitude to use free speech values against us</em>.&rdquo; He punctuated his speech with this threat: &ldquo;To give them the space to crush us with misappropriated secrets is a perversion of what our great Constitution stands for. It ends now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>From the start, the Trump DOJ has made no secret of its desire to criminalize journalism generally. Early in the Trump administration, Sessions <a href=\"https://www.huffpostbrasil.com/entry/sessions-jailing-journalists-media_n_5984dcbae4b041356ebfc875\">explicitly discussed</a> the possibility of prosecuting journalists for publishing classified information. Trump and his key aides were open about how eager they were to build on, and escalate, the Obama administration&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/30/barack-obama-press-freedom-strong-media-stop-donald-trump\">progress in enabling journalism in the U.S. to be criminalized</a>.</p>\n<p>Today&rsquo;s arrest of Assange is clearly the culmination of a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/verabergengruen/ecuador-julian-assange-anti-american-embassy-london\">two-year effort by the U.S. government</a> to coerce Ecuador &mdash; under its <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/05/16/ecuadors-ex-president-rafael-correa-denounces-treatment-of-julian-assange-as-torture/\">new and submissive president, Len&iacute;n Moreno</a> &mdash; to withdraw the asylum protection it extended to Assange in 2012. Rescinding Assange&rsquo;s asylum would enable the U.K. to arrest Assange on minor bail-jumping charges pending in London and, far more significantly, to rely on an extradition request from the U.S. government to send him to a country to which he has no connection (the U.S.) to stand trial relating to leaked documents.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Trump administration&rsquo;s motive here is clear. With Ecuador withdrawing its asylum protection and subserviently allowing the U.K. to enter its own embassy to arrest Assange, Assange faced no charges other than a minor bail-jumping charge in the U.K. (Sweden <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/05/19/sweden-withdraws-arrest-warrant-for-julian-assange-but-he-still-faces-serious-legal-jeopardy/\">closed its sexual assault investigation</a> not because they concluded Assange was innocent, but because they spent years unsuccessfully trying to extradite him). By indicting Assange and demanding his extradition, it ensures that Assange &mdash; once he serves his time in a London jail for bail-jumping &mdash; will be kept in a British prison for the full year or longer that it takes for the U.S. extradition request, which Assange will certainly contest, to wind its way through the British courts.</p>\n<p><u>The indictment tries</u> to cast itself as charging Assange not with journalistic activities but with criminal hacking. But it is a thinly disguised pretext for prosecuting Assange for publishing the U.S. government&rsquo;s secret documents while pretending to make it about something else.</p>\n<p>Whatever else is true about the indictment, substantial parts of the document explicitly characterize as criminal exactly the actions that journalists routinely engage in with their sources and thus, constitutes a dangerous attempt to criminalize investigative journalism.</p>\n<p>The indictment, for instance, places great emphasis on Assange&rsquo;s alleged encouragement that Manning &mdash; after she already turned over hundreds of thousands of classified documents &mdash; try to get more documents for WikiLeaks to publish. The indictment claims that &ldquo;discussions also reflect Assange actively encouraging Manning to provide more information. During an exchange, Manning told Assange that &lsquo;after this upload, that&rsquo;s all I really have got left.&rsquo; To which Assange replied, &lsquo;curious eyes never run dry in my experience.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But encouraging sources to obtain more information is something journalists do routinely. Indeed, it would be a breach of one&rsquo;s journalistic duties <em>not</em> to ask vital sources with access to classified information if they could provide even more information so as to allow more complete reporting. If a source comes to a journalist with information, it is entirely common and expected that the journalist would reply: <em>Can you also get me X, Y, and Z to complete the story or to make it better? </em>As Edward Snowden <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1116342647327797249\">said this morning</a>, &ldquo;Bob Woodward stated publicly he would have advised me to remain in place and act as a mole.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Investigative journalism in many, if not most, cases, entails a constant back and forth between journalist and source in which the journalist tries to induce the source to provide more classified information, even if doing so is illegal. To include such &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; as part of a criminal indictment &mdash; as the Trump DOJ did today &mdash; is to criminalize the crux of investigative journalism itself, even if the indictment includes other activities you believe fall outside the scope of journalism.</p>\n<p>As Northwestern journalism professor Dan Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/dec/16/julian-assange-wikileaks-eric-holder\">explained in The Guardian</a> in 2010 when denouncing as a press freedom threat the Obama DOJ&rsquo;s attempts to indict Assange based on the theory that he did more than passively receive and publish documents &mdash; i.e., that he actively &ldquo;colluded&rdquo; with Manning:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The problem is that there is no meaningful distinction to be made. How did the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/the-us-embassy-cables\">Guardian, equally, not &ldquo;collude&rdquo; with WikiLeaks in obtaining the cables</a>? How did the New York Times not &ldquo;collude&rdquo; with the Guardian when the Guardian gave the Times a copy following Assange&rsquo;s decision to cut the Times out of the latest document dump?</p> <p>For that matter, I don&rsquo;t see how any news organisation can be said not to have colluded with a source when it receives leaked documents. Didn&rsquo;t the Times collude with Daniel Ellsberg when it <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg\">received the Pentagon Papers</a> from him? Yes, there are differences. Ellsberg had finished making copies long before he began working with the Times, whereas Assange may have goaded Manning. But does that really matter?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Most of the reports about the Assange indictment today have falsely suggested that the Trump DOJ discovered some sort of new evidence that proved Assange tried to help Manning hack through a password in order to use a different username to download documents. Aside from the fact that those attempts failed, none of this is new: As the last five paragraphs of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2011/12/defense-manning-was-overcharged-070787?paginate=false\">this 2011 Politico story demonstrate</a>, that Assange talked to Manning about ways to use a different username so as to avoid detection was part of Manning&rsquo;s trial and was long known to the Obama DOJ when they decided not to prosecute.</p>\n<p>There are only two new events that explain today&rsquo;s indictment of Assange: 1) The Trump administration from the start included authoritarian extremists such as Sessions and Pompeo who do not care in the slightest about press freedom and were determined to criminalize journalism against the U.S., and 2) With Ecuador about to withdraw its asylum protection, the U.S. government needed an excuse to prevent Assange from walking free.</p>\n<p><u>A technical analysis</u> of the indictment&rsquo;s claims similarly proves the charge against Assange to be a serious threat to First Amendment press liberties, primarily because it seeks to criminalize what is actually a journalist&rsquo;s core duty: helping one&rsquo;s source avoid detection. The indictment deceitfully seeks to cast Assange&rsquo;s efforts to help Manning maintain her anonymity as some sort of sinister hacking attack.</p>\n<p>The Defense Department computer that Manning used to download the documents which she then furnished to WikiLeaks was likely running the Windows operating system. It had multiple user accounts on it, including an account to which Manning had legitimate access. Each account is protected by a password, and Windows computers store a file that contains a list of usernames and password &ldquo;hashes,&rdquo; or scrambled versions of the passwords. Only accounts designated as &ldquo;administrator,&rdquo; a designation Manning&rsquo;s account lacked, have permission to access this file.</p>\n<p>The indictment suggests that Manning, in order to access this password file, powered off her computer and then powered it back on, this time booting to a CD running the Linux operating system. From within Linux, she allegedly accessed this file full of password hashes. The indictment alleges that Assange agreed to try to crack one of these password hashes, which, if successful, would recover the original password. With the original password, Manning would be able to log directly into that other user&rsquo;s account, which &mdash; as the indictment puts it &mdash; &ldquo;would have made it more difficult for investigators to identify Manning as the source of disclosures of classified information.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Assange appears to have been unsuccessful in cracking the password. The indictment alleges that &ldquo;Assange indicated that he had been trying to crack the password by stating that he had &lsquo;no luck so far.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Thus, even if one accepts all of the indictment&rsquo;s claims as true, Assange was not trying to hack into new document files to which Manning had no access, but rather trying to help Manning avoid detection as a source. For that reason, the precedent that this case would set would be a devastating blow to investigative journalists and press freedom everywhere.</p>\n<p>Journalists have an ethical obligation to take steps to protect their sources from retaliation, which sometimes includes granting them anonymity and employing technical measures to help ensure that their identity is not discovered. When journalists take source protection seriously, they strip metadata and redact information from documents before publishing them if that information could have been used to identify their source; they host cloud-based systems such as SecureDrop, now <a href=\"https://securedrop.org/directory/\">employed by dozens of major newsrooms around the world</a>, that make it easier and safer for whistleblowers, who may be under surveillance, to send messages and classified documents to journalists without their employers knowing; and they use secure communication tools like Signal and set them to automatically delete messages.</p>\n<p>But today&rsquo;s indictment of Assange seeks <em>to criminalize</em> exactly these types of source-protection efforts, as it states that &ldquo;it was part of the conspiracy that Assange and Manning used a special folder on a cloud drop box of WikiLeaks to transmit classified records containing information related to the national defense of the United States.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The indictment, in numerous other passages, plainly conflates standard newsroom best practices with a criminal conspiracy. It states, for instance, that &ldquo;it was part of the conspiracy that Assange and Manning used the &lsquo;Jabber&rsquo; online chat service to collaborate on the acquisition and dissemination of the classified records, and to enter into the agreement to crack the password [&hellip;].&rdquo; There is no question that using Jabber, or any other encrypted messaging system, to communicate with sources and acquire documents with the intent to publish them, is a completely lawful and standard part of modern investigative journalism. Newsrooms across the world now use similar technologies to communicate securely with their sources and to help their sources avoid detection by the government.</p>\n<p>The indictment similarly alleges that &ldquo;it was part of the conspiracy that Assange and Manning took measures to conceal Manning as the source of the disclosure of classified records to WikiLeaks, including by removing usernames from the disclosed information and deleting chat logs between Assange and Manning.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Removing metadata that could help identify an anonymous source, such as usernames, is a critical step in protecting sources. Indeed, in 2017, The Intercept <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/\">published</a> a top-secret National Security Agency document claiming that Russian military intelligence played a role in hacking U.S. election infrastructure during the 2016 election. The person accused and convicted of having provided the document, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/08/23/reality-winner-sentenced-leak-election-hacking/\">whistleblower Reality Winner</a>, had already been arrested by the time the story was published.</p>\n<p>The Intercept was <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/the-mysterious-printer-code-that-could-have-led-the-fbi-to-reality-winner/529350/\">widely criticized</a> when computer security experts discovered that the document included nearly invisible yellow &ldquo;printer dots&rdquo; that track exactly when and where it was printed, which most modern printers add to every document that gets printed. While there&rsquo;s no evidence that these printer dots contributed to Winner becoming a suspect (the FBI&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-government-contractor-georgia-charged-removing-and-mailing-classified-materials-news\">affidavit</a> says she was one of only six people who had printed this document, and the only one of those who had email contact with The Intercept), they could have aided an investigation, and The Intercept, as its editor-in-chief <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/07/11/first-look-to-support-defense-of-reality-winner-in-espionage-act-prosecution/\">acknowledged</a>, should have taken greater care to remove this metadata before publishing the document.</p>\n<p>That is because it is not only common but ethically required for a journalist to do everything possible to protect a source from detection. Virtually the entirety of the accusations against Assange in today&rsquo;s indictment consist of him doing exactly that.</p>\n<p>For that reason, the indictment, at its core, clearly seeks to criminalize what investigative journalism necessarily entails in order for to be effective. That is why civil liberties organizations, <a href=\"https://freedom.press/news/civil-liberties-groups-condemn-trump-admins-indictment-julian-assange/\">press freedom groups</a> and political figures from around the world &mdash; including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1116424423953903616\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, U.S. Congress members <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1116460705765646336\">Ro Khanna</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1116446982342529024\">Tulsi Gabbard</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeGravel/status/1116387680231796736\">former Sen. Mike Gravel</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1116451848758677504\">Brazilian</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cpimspeak/status/1116286008662712320\">Indian</a> leftist political parties, and <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-comment-julian-assange-arrest\">the American Civil Liberties Union</a> &mdash; have vehemently denounced today&rsquo;s arrest of Assange.</p>\n<p>Assange is a deeply polarizing figure. That&rsquo;s almost certainly why the Trump DOJ believes that it could get away with indicting him based on a theory that would clearly endanger core journalistic functions: because it hopes that the intense animosity for Assange personally will blind people to the dangers this indictment poses.</p>\n<p>But far more important than one&rsquo;s personal feelings about Assange is the huge step this indictment represents in the Trump administration&rsquo;s explicitly stated goal to criminalize journalism that involves reporting on classified information. Opposition to that menacing goal does not require admiration or affection for Assange. It simply requires a belief in the critical importance of a free press in a democracy.</p>\n<p>Wait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn&rsquo;t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren&rsquo;t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don&rsquo;t have ads, so we depend on our members &mdash; 35,000 and counting &mdash; to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn&rsquo;t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month. That&rsquo;s all it takes to support the journalism you rely on.</p>",

                "text": "The indictment of Julian Assange unsealed today by the Trump Justice Department poses grave threats to press freedoms, not only in the U.S. but around the world. The charging document and accompanying extradition request from the U.S. government, used by the U.K. police to arrest Assange once Ecuador officially withdrew its asylum protection, seeks to criminalize numerous activities at the core of investigative journalism.\nSo much of what has been reported today about this indictment has been false. Two facts in particular have been utterly distorted by the DOJ and then misreported by numerous media organizations.\nThe first crucial fact about the indictment is that its key allegation \u2014 that Assange did not merely receive classified documents from Chelsea Manning but tried to help her crack a password in order to cover her tracks \u2014 is not new. It was long known by the Obama DOJ and was explicitly part of Manning\u2019s trial, yet the Obama DOJ \u2014 not exactly renowned for being stalwart guardians of press freedoms \u2014 concluded that it could not and should not prosecute Assange because indicting him would pose serious threats to press freedom. In sum, today\u2019s indictment contains no new evidence or facts about Assange\u2019s actions; all of it has been known for years.\nThe other key fact being widely misreported is that the indictment accuses Assange of trying to help Manning obtain access to document databases to which she had no valid access: i.e., hacking rather than journalism. But the indictment alleges no such thing. Rather, it simply accuses Assange of trying to help Manning log into the Defense Department\u2019s computers using a different username so that she could maintain her anonymity while downloading documents in the public interest and then furnish them to WikiLeaks to publish.\nIn other words, the indictment seeks to criminalize what journalists are not only permitted but ethically required to do: take steps to help their sources maintain their anonymity. As longtime Assange lawyer Barry Pollack put it: \u201cThe factual allegations \u2026 boil down to encouraging a source to provide him information and taking efforts to protect the identity of that source. Journalists around the world should be deeply troubled by these unprecedented criminal charges.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why the indictment poses such a grave threat to press freedom. It characterizes as a felony many actions that journalists are not just permitted but required to take in order to conduct sensitive reporting in the digital age.\nBut because the DOJ issued a press release with a headline that claimed that Assange was accused of \u201chacking\u201d crimes, media outlets mindlessly repeated this claim even though the indictment contains no such allegation. It merely accuses Assange of trying to help Manning avoid detection. That\u2019s not \u201chacking.\u201d That\u2019s called a core obligation of journalism.\nThe history of this case is vital for understanding what actually happened today. The U.S. government has been determined to indict Julian Assange and WikiLeaks since at least 2010, when the group published hundreds of thousands of war logs and diplomatic cables revealing numerous war crimes and other acts of corruption by the U.S., the U.K., and other governments around the world. To achieve that goal, the Obama DOJ empaneled a grand jury in 2011 and conducted a sweeping investigation into WikiLeaks, Assange, and Manning.\nBut in 2013, the Obama DOJ concluded that it could not prosecute Assange in connection with the publication of those documents because there was no way to distinguish what WikiLeaks did from what the New York Times, The Guardian, and numerous media outlets around the world routinely do: namely, work with sources to publish classified documents.\nThe Obama DOJ tried for years to find evidence to justify a claim that Assange did more than act as a journalist \u2014 that he, for instance, illegally worked with Manning to steal the documents \u2014 but found nothing to justify that accusation and thus, never indicted Assange (as noted, the Obama DOJ since at least 2011 was well-aware of the core allegation of today\u2019s indictment \u2014 that Assange tried to help Manning circumvent a password wall so she could use a different username \u2014 because that was all part of Manning\u2019s charges).\nSo Obama ended eight years in office without indicting Assange or WikiLeaks. Everything regarding Assange\u2019s possible indictment changed only at the start of the Trump administration. Beginning in early 2017, the most reactionary Trump officials were determined to do what the Obama DOJ refused to do: indict Assange in connection with publication of the Manning documents.\nAs the New York Times reported late last year, \u201cSoon after he took over as C.I.A. director, [current Secretary of State] Mike Pompeo privately told lawmakers about a new target for American spies: Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks.\u201d The Times added that \u201cMr. Pompeo and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions unleashed an aggressive campaign against Mr. Assange, reversing an Obama-era view of WikiLeaks as a journalistic entity.\u201d\nIn April, 2017, Pompeo, while still CIA chief, delivered a deranged speech proclaiming that \u201cwe have to recognize that we can no longer allow Assange and his colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us.\u201d He punctuated his speech with this threat: \u201cTo give them the space to crush us with misappropriated secrets is a perversion of what our great Constitution stands for. It ends now.\u201d\nFrom the start, the Trump DOJ has made no secret of its desire to criminalize journalism generally. Early in the Trump administration, Sessions explicitly discussed the possibility of prosecuting journalists for publishing classified information. Trump and his key aides were open about how eager they were to build on, and escalate, the Obama administration\u2019s progress in enabling journalism in the U.S. to be criminalized.\nToday\u2019s arrest of Assange is clearly the culmination of a two-year effort by the U.S. government to coerce Ecuador \u2014 under its new and submissive president, Len\u00edn Moreno \u2014 to withdraw the asylum protection it extended to Assange in 2012. Rescinding Assange\u2019s asylum would enable the U.K. to arrest Assange on minor bail-jumping charges pending in London and, far more significantly, to rely on an extradition request from the U.S. government to send him to a country to which he has no connection (the U.S.) to stand trial relating to leaked documents.\nIndeed, the Trump administration\u2019s motive here is clear. With Ecuador withdrawing its asylum protection and subserviently allowing the U.K. to enter its own embassy to arrest Assange, Assange faced no charges other than a minor bail-jumping charge in the U.K. (Sweden closed its sexual assault investigation not because they concluded Assange was innocent, but because they spent years unsuccessfully trying to extradite him). By indicting Assange and demanding his extradition, it ensures that Assange \u2014 once he serves his time in a London jail for bail-jumping \u2014 will be kept in a British prison for the full year or longer that it takes for the U.S. extradition request, which Assange will certainly contest, to wind its way through the British courts.\nThe indictment tries to cast itself as charging Assange not with journalistic activities but with criminal hacking. But it is a thinly disguised pretext for prosecuting Assange for publishing the U.S. government\u2019s secret documents while pretending to make it about something else.\nWhatever else is true about the indictment, substantial parts of the document explicitly characterize as criminal exactly the actions that journalists routinely engage in with their sources and thus, constitutes a dangerous attempt to criminalize investigative journalism.\nThe indictment, for instance, places great emphasis on Assange\u2019s alleged encouragement that Manning \u2014 after she already turned over hundreds of thousands of classified documents \u2014 try to get more documents for WikiLeaks to publish. The indictment claims that \u201cdiscussions also reflect Assange actively encouraging Manning to provide more information. During an exchange, Manning told Assange that \u2018after this upload, that\u2019s all I really have got left.\u2019 To which Assange replied, \u2018curious eyes never run dry in my experience.\u2019\u201d\nBut encouraging sources to obtain more information is something journalists do routinely. Indeed, it would be a breach of one\u2019s journalistic duties not to ask vital sources with access to classified information if they could provide even more information so as to allow more complete reporting. If a source comes to a journalist with information, it is entirely common and expected that the journalist would reply: Can you also get me X, Y, and Z to complete the story or to make it better? As Edward Snowden said this morning, \u201cBob Woodward stated publicly he would have advised me to remain in place and act as a mole.\u201d\nInvestigative journalism in many, if not most, cases, entails a constant back and forth between journalist and source in which the journalist tries to induce the source to provide more classified information, even if doing so is illegal. To include such \u201cencouragement\u201d as part of a criminal indictment \u2014 as the Trump DOJ did today \u2014 is to criminalize the crux of investigative journalism itself, even if the indictment includes other activities you believe fall outside the scope of journalism.\nAs Northwestern journalism professor Dan Kennedy explained in The Guardian in 2010 when denouncing as a press freedom threat the Obama DOJ\u2019s attempts to indict Assange based on the theory that he did more than passively receive and publish documents \u2014 i.e., that he actively \u201ccolluded\u201d with Manning:\nThe problem is that there is no meaningful distinction to be made. How did the Guardian, equally, not \u201ccollude\u201d with WikiLeaks in obtaining the cables? How did the New York Times not \u201ccollude\u201d with the Guardian when the Guardian gave the Times a copy following Assange\u2019s decision to cut the Times out of the latest document dump?\nFor that matter, I don\u2019t see how any news organisation can be said not to have colluded with a source when it receives leaked documents. Didn\u2019t the Times collude with Daniel Ellsberg when it received the Pentagon Papers from him? Yes, there are differences. Ellsberg had finished making copies long before he began working with the Times, whereas Assange may have goaded Manning. But does that really matter?\nMost of the reports about the Assange indictment today have falsely suggested that the Trump DOJ discovered some sort of new evidence that proved Assange tried to help Manning hack through a password in order to use a different username to download documents. Aside from the fact that those attempts failed, none of this is new: As the last five paragraphs of this 2011 Politico story demonstrate, that Assange talked to Manning about ways to use a different username so as to avoid detection was part of Manning\u2019s trial and was long known to the Obama DOJ when they decided not to prosecute.\nThere are only two new events that explain today\u2019s indictment of Assange: 1) The Trump administration from the start included authoritarian extremists such as Sessions and Pompeo who do not care in the slightest about press freedom and were determined to criminalize journalism against the U.S., and 2) With Ecuador about to withdraw its asylum protection, the U.S. government needed an excuse to prevent Assange from walking free.\nA technical analysis of the indictment\u2019s claims similarly proves the charge against Assange to be a serious threat to First Amendment press liberties, primarily because it seeks to criminalize what is actually a journalist\u2019s core duty: helping one\u2019s source avoid detection. The indictment deceitfully seeks to cast Assange\u2019s efforts to help Manning maintain her anonymity as some sort of sinister hacking attack.\nThe Defense Department computer that Manning used to download the documents which she then furnished to WikiLeaks was likely running the Windows operating system. It had multiple user accounts on it, including an account to which Manning had legitimate access. Each account is protected by a password, and Windows computers store a file that contains a list of usernames and password \u201chashes,\u201d or scrambled versions of the passwords. Only accounts designated as \u201cadministrator,\u201d a designation Manning\u2019s account lacked, have permission to access this file.\nThe indictment suggests that Manning, in order to access this password file, powered off her computer and then powered it back on, this time booting to a CD running the Linux operating system. From within Linux, she allegedly accessed this file full of password hashes. The indictment alleges that Assange agreed to try to crack one of these password hashes, which, if successful, would recover the original password. With the original password, Manning would be able to log directly into that other user\u2019s account, which \u2014 as the indictment puts it \u2014 \u201cwould have made it more difficult for investigators to identify Manning as the source of disclosures of classified information.\u201d\nAssange appears to have been unsuccessful in cracking the password. The indictment alleges that \u201cAssange indicated that he had been trying to crack the password by stating that he had \u2018no luck so far.\u2019\u201d\nThus, even if one accepts all of the indictment\u2019s claims as true, Assange was not trying to hack into new document files to which Manning had no access, but rather trying to help Manning avoid detection as a source. For that reason, the precedent that this case would set would be a devastating blow to investigative journalists and press freedom everywhere.\nJournalists have an ethical obligation to take steps to protect their sources from retaliation, which sometimes includes granting them anonymity and employing technical measures to help ensure that their identity is not discovered. When journalists take source protection seriously, they strip metadata and redact information from documents before publishing them if that information could have been used to identify their source; they host cloud-based systems such as SecureDrop, now employed by dozens of major newsrooms around the world, that make it easier and safer for whistleblowers, who may be under surveillance, to send messages and classified documents to journalists without their employers knowing; and they use secure communication tools like Signal and set them to automatically delete messages.\nBut today\u2019s indictment of Assange seeks to criminalize exactly these types of source-protection efforts, as it states that \u201cit was part of the conspiracy that Assange and Manning used a special folder on a cloud drop box of WikiLeaks to transmit classified records containing information related to the national defense of the United States.\u201d\nThe indictment, in numerous other passages, plainly conflates standard newsroom best practices with a criminal conspiracy. It states, for instance, that \u201cit was part of the conspiracy that Assange and Manning used the \u2018Jabber\u2019 online chat service to collaborate on the acquisition and dissemination of the classified records, and to enter into the agreement to crack the password [\u2026].\u201d There is no question that using Jabber, or any other encrypted messaging system, to communicate with sources and acquire documents with the intent to publish them, is a completely lawful and standard part of modern investigative journalism. Newsrooms across the world now use similar technologies to communicate securely with their sources and to help their sources avoid detection by the government.\nThe indictment similarly alleges that \u201cit was part of the conspiracy that Assange and Manning took measures to conceal Manning as the source of the disclosure of classified records to WikiLeaks, including by removing usernames from the disclosed information and deleting chat logs between Assange and Manning.\u201d\nRemoving metadata that could help identify an anonymous source, such as usernames, is a critical step in protecting sources. Indeed, in 2017, The Intercept published a top-secret National Security Agency document claiming that Russian military intelligence played a role in hacking U.S. election infrastructure during the 2016 election. The person accused and convicted of having provided the document, whistleblower Reality Winner, had already been arrested by the time the story was published.\nThe Intercept was widely criticized when computer security experts discovered that the document included nearly invisible yellow \u201cprinter dots\u201d that track exactly when and where it was printed, which most modern printers add to every document that gets printed. While there\u2019s no evidence that these printer dots contributed to Winner becoming a suspect (the FBI\u2019s affidavit says she was one of only six people who had printed this document, and the only one of those who had email contact with The Intercept), they could have aided an investigation, and The Intercept, as its editor-in-chief acknowledged, should have taken greater care to remove this metadata before publishing the document.\nThat is because it is not only common but ethically required for a journalist to do everything possible to protect a source from detection. Virtually the entirety of the accusations against Assange in today\u2019s indictment consist of him doing exactly that.\nFor that reason, the indictment, at its core, clearly seeks to criminalize what investigative journalism necessarily entails in order for to be effective. That is why civil liberties organizations, press freedom groups and political figures from around the world \u2014 including Jeremy Corbyn, U.S. Congress members Ro Khanna and Tulsi Gabbard, former Sen. Mike Gravel, Brazilian and Indian leftist political parties, and the American Civil Liberties Union \u2014 have vehemently denounced today\u2019s arrest of Assange.\nAssange is a deeply polarizing figure. That\u2019s almost certainly why the Trump DOJ believes that it could get away with indicting him based on a theory that would clearly endanger core journalistic functions: because it hopes that the intense animosity for Assange personally will blind people to the dangers this indictment poses.\nBut far more important than one\u2019s personal feelings about Assange is the huge step this indictment represents in the Trump administration\u2019s explicitly stated goal to criminalize journalism that involves reporting on classified information. Opposition to that menacing goal does not require admiration or affection for Assange. It simply requires a belief in the critical importance of a free press in a democracy.\nWait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn\u2019t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren\u2019t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don\u2019t have ads, so we depend on our members \u2014 35,000 and counting \u2014 to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn\u2019t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month. That\u2019s all it takes to support the journalism you rely on.",

The actions of those terrorists, she told supporters of the group, had led some Americans to associate everyone of that faith with terrorism. &ldquo;For far too long,&rdquo; Omar said, &ldquo;we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I&rsquo;m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Although Omar&rsquo;s reference to the attackers having been Muslims was vague, it was not, as her enemies claimed, flip or dismissive &mdash; nor was it intended as a description of the attack itself.</p>\n<p>The video posted on Twitter by Trump clipped out Omar&rsquo;s passing reference to the attacks &mdash; set to unsettling music and played on a loop with footage of the attack in New York &mdash; and treated it as if it were proof that Omar had described the massacre as unimportant. Trump&rsquo;s all-caps caption for his video, &ldquo;WE WILL NEVER FORGET,&rdquo; was echoed in a closing on-screen title, which read: &ldquo;September 11, 2001. WE REMEMBER.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In addition to the false accusation against Omar, that closing invocation to remember was an accidental reminder that Trump had revealed, during the 2016 campaign, that he does not, in fact, recall the events of that day clearly. By insisting, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/02/video-report-cited-as-evidence-of-trumps-claim-of-mass-911-celebrations-is-debunked/\">against all evidence to the contrary</a>, that he remembered watching on television as &ldquo;thousands and thousands&rdquo; of American Muslims in New Jersey cheered the collapse of the towers, Trump betrayed that he was either genuinely confused and believed that something <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/24/the-video-of-celebrations-that-was-broadcast-on-911/\">he had imagined</a> actually took place, or that he was willing to smear an entire faith community by pretending that their behavior matched his delusion.</p>\n<p>The gross distortion of Omar&rsquo;s actual comments was initiated by a <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/religion/welcome-to-the-weird-world-of-australias-fake-sheikh-mohammad-ta/10095874\">fringe</a> Shiite Muslim cleric in Australia, Mohamad Tawhidi, whose <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fv_tWSNsv88\">embrace of far-right myths</a> about Sunni Muslim plots to destroy Western civilization has made him a favorite of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bX28hCVoPUo\">Australian nativists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/episodes/fake-sheikh-of-shock/9972660\">tabloid journalists</a> working for Rupert Murdoch.

Dan Crenshaw</a>, a Texas Republican.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw&rsquo;s tweet then formed the basis for a segment broadcast into the White House during <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattshuham/status/1115982828754415617\">the Wednesday morning edition</a> of the president&rsquo;s daily briefing, a.k.a &ldquo;Fox and Friends.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The claim from Fox, that Omar&rsquo;s comment &ldquo;trivializes September the 11th,&rdquo; was followed by a New York Post cover showing the towers under attack, which seems in turn to have inspired Trump&rsquo;s video. So a false claim made about Omar by a fringe figure in Australia, who owes his celebrity to journalists working for Rupert Murdoch, was then amplified by Murdoch&rsquo;s American television network and Murdoch&rsquo;s New York tabloid, both of which shape the American president&rsquo;s worldview.</p>\n<p>Omar said in a statement released late on Sunday that the incitement had produced a response from Trump&rsquo;s followers. &ldquo;Since the President&rsquo;s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life&mdash;many directly referencing or replying to the President&rsquo;s video,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>\n<p>The objection of Trump&rsquo;s defenders, that the president and like-minded Republicans were merely responding to Omar&rsquo;s words, is undercut by the fact that his video seems to echo a bigoted internet meme displayed on a poster in West Virginia&rsquo;s Capitol last month, which was made well before she said anything at all about 9/11.</p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\"><p>This poster is in your Capitol on a booth sponsored by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WVGOP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WVGOP</a> &ldquo;When someone shows you who they are, believe them&rdquo; <a href=\"https://t.co/4k566ztHWo\">pic.twitter.com/4k566ztHWo</a></p>&mdash; (((Mike Pushkin))) (@pushkinforhouse) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pushkinforhouse/status/1101532563020148737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 1, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<p>The message of that poster, and the barely concealed subtext of attacks on Omar by Trump and other Republicans, is that the mere presence of a Muslim woman in Congress is proof that Americans have &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; the terror attacks &mdash; by failing to embrace bigotry.</p>\n<p>After Sanders and Warren spoke out against Trump&rsquo;s video on Friday night, their comments were followed throughout the weekend by statements expressing varying levels of support for Omar from almost all of the leading contenders for the Democratic nomination.</p>\n<blockquote data-width=\"500\"><p>President Trump's inflammatory and dangerous rhetoric towards Ilhan Omar is jeopardizing her safety.

                "text": "Democratic presidential candidates, led by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, spoke out forcefully in defense of Rep. Ilhan Omar this weekend, after the president of the United States risked inciting violence against the Muslim congressperson by endorsing the false claim that she downplayed the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\nIlhan Omar is a leader with strength and courage. She won't back down to Trump's racism and hate, and neither will we. The disgusting and dangerous attacks against her must end.\n\u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 13, 2019\nThe President is inciting violence against a sitting Congresswoman\u2014and an entire group of Americans based on their religion. It's disgusting. It's shameful. And any elected leader who refuses to condemn it shares responsibility for it.\n\u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) April 13, 2019\nThose comments from the progressive Democratic senators contrasted sharply with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s initial failure to even mention that Omar, whose life has recently been threatened by a Trump fan, was the target of the president\u2019s inflammatory tweet, which mixed video of her with harrowing images of the World Trade Center towers falling.\nAs we visit our troops in Stuttgart to thank them and be briefed by them, we honor our first responsibility as leaders to protect and defend the American people. It is wrong for the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to fan the flames to make anyone less safe.\n\u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) April 13, 2019\nAfter a wave of criticism for those tepid remarks \u2014 which seemed to endorse the claim that Omar had somehow erred in failing to show \u201creverence\u201d in how she referred to the 9/11 attacks \u2014 Pelosi called on Sunday for Trump\u2019s tweet to be deleted and asked for security to be stepped up for Omar.\n.@realDonaldTrump\u2019s dangerous video must be taken down. I have spoken with the Sergeant-at-Arms to ensure that Capitol Police are conducting a security assessment to safeguard Rep. @Ilhan Omar, her family & her staff. They will continue to monitor & address the threats she faces. pic.twitter.com/Grb9c8S18d\n\u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) April 14, 2019\nPelosi was forced to take the threats to Omar more seriously by the fact that, as the weekend wore on, more and more Democrats followed the lead of Sanders and Warren, who denounced Trump\u2019s tweet for its incitement against the Muslim representative rather than its use of 9/11 imagery.\nTrump had propelled the smear campaign against Omar into overdrive on Friday night, taking his cues from Fox News and the New York Post, which stoked outrage by distorting a reference to the attacks that Omar made during a speech in support of a Muslim civil rights group.\nThe raw material for the manufactured outrage was video of Omar discussing the work of the rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, in combating anti-Muslim bigotry after the September 11 attacks. The actions of those terrorists, she told supporters of the group, had led some Americans to associate everyone of that faith with terrorism. \u201cFor far too long,\u201d Omar said, \u201cwe have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I\u2019m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\u201d\nAlthough Omar\u2019s reference to the attackers having been Muslims was vague, it was not, as her enemies claimed, flip or dismissive \u2014 nor was it intended as a description of the attack itself.\nThe video posted on Twitter by Trump clipped out Omar\u2019s passing reference to the attacks \u2014 set to unsettling music and played on a loop with footage of the attack in New York \u2014 and treated it as if it were proof that Omar had described the massacre as unimportant. Trump\u2019s all-caps caption for his video, \u201cWE WILL NEVER FORGET,\u201d was echoed in a closing on-screen title, which read: \u201cSeptember 11, 2001. WE REMEMBER.\u201d\nIn addition to the false accusation against Omar, that closing invocation to remember was an accidental reminder that Trump had revealed, during the 2016 campaign, that he does not, in fact, recall the events of that day clearly. By insisting, against all evidence to the contrary, that he remembered watching on television as \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of American Muslims in New Jersey cheered the collapse of the towers, Trump betrayed that he was either genuinely confused and believed that something he had imagined actually took place, or that he was willing to smear an entire faith community by pretending that their behavior matched his delusion.\nThe gross distortion of Omar\u2019s actual comments was initiated by a fringe Shiite Muslim cleric in Australia, Mohamad Tawhidi, whose embrace of far-right myths about Sunni Muslim plots to destroy Western civilization has made him a favorite of Australian nativists and tabloid journalists working for Rupert Murdoch. Tawhidi tweeted video of the congressperson, edited from a Daily Caller edit, along with an inflammatory lie: that \u201cOmar mentions 9/11 and does not consider it a terrorist attack.\u201d\nThat false claim, along with another lie \u2014 that Omar sought \u201cto justify the establishment of a terrorist organization (CAIR) on US soil\u201d \u2014 was amplified by Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican.\nCrenshaw\u2019s tweet then formed the basis for a segment broadcast into the White House during the Wednesday morning edition of the president\u2019s daily briefing, a.k.a \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d\nThe claim from Fox, that Omar\u2019s comment \u201ctrivializes September the 11th,\u201d was followed by a New York Post cover showing the towers under attack, which seems in turn to have inspired Trump\u2019s video. So a false claim made about Omar by a fringe figure in Australia, who owes his celebrity to journalists working for Rupert Murdoch, was then amplified by Murdoch\u2019s American television network and Murdoch\u2019s New York tabloid, both of which shape the American president\u2019s worldview.\nOmar said in a statement released late on Sunday that the incitement had produced a response from Trump\u2019s followers. \u201cSince the President\u2019s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life\u2014many directly referencing or replying to the President\u2019s video,\u201d she wrote.\nThe objection of Trump\u2019s defenders, that the president and like-minded Republicans were merely responding to Omar\u2019s words, is undercut by the fact that his video seems to echo a bigoted internet meme displayed on a poster in West Virginia\u2019s Capitol last month, which was made well before she said anything at all about 9/11.\nThis poster is in your Capitol on a booth sponsored by @WVGOP \u201cWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them\u201d pic.twitter.com/4k566ztHWo\n\u2014 (((Mike Pushkin))) (@pushkinforhouse) March 1, 2019\nThe message of that poster, and the barely concealed subtext of attacks on Omar by Trump and other Republicans, is that the mere presence of a Muslim woman in Congress is proof that Americans have \u201cforgotten\u201d the terror attacks \u2014 by failing to embrace bigotry.\nAfter Sanders and Warren spoke out against Trump\u2019s video on Friday night, their comments were followed throughout the weekend by statements expressing varying levels of support for Omar from almost all of the leading contenders for the Democratic nomination.\nPresident Trump's inflammatory and dangerous rhetoric towards Ilhan Omar is jeopardizing her safety. He is deliberately putting her and all Muslim Americans in harm's way.\n\u2014 Jay Inslee (@JayInslee) April 13, 2019\nWe are stronger than this president\u2019s hatred and Islamophobia. Do not let him drive us apart or make us afraid.\n\u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) April 13, 2019\nAfter 9/11 we all said we were changed. That we were stronger and more united. That\u2019s what \u201cnever forget\u201d was about. Now, a president uses that dark day to incite his base against a member of Congress, as if for sport. As if we learned nothing that day about the workings of hate.\n\u2014 Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) April 13, 2019\nI served overseas, at risk to my life, in the struggle against such terrorism. But it can only be fully defeated if we have leaders at home who defuse its capacity to sow hate\u2014hate against Islam or against any number of \u201cothers.\u201d\n\u2014 Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) April 13, 2019\nPresident Trump's personal attack against Representative Omar is vile and shameful. It's not just below the office, it's dangerous and dishonest.\n\u2014 John Hickenlooper (@Hickenlooper) April 13, 2019\nSomeone has already been charged with a serious threat on Congresswoman Omar\u2019s life. The video the President chose to send out today will only incite more hate. You can disagree with her words\u2014as I have done before\u2014but this video is wrong. Enough.\n\u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) April 13, 2019\nFor two years, this President has used the most powerful platform in the world to sow hate & division. He's done it again. Putting the safety of a sitting member of Congress @IlhanMN at risk & vilifying a whole religion is beyond the pale. I'll be blunt \u2014 we must defeat him.\n\u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) April 13, 2019\nTrump is shamelessly trying to foment religious bigotry against ?#IlhanOmar & all Muslims, based on the horrendous actions of a few individuals claiming to be Muslim. This is the very definition of religious bigotry & Trump is fomenting it for political gain. Dangerous & sad pic.twitter.com/vcpnTGFlrD\n\u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) April 14, 2019\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke was criticized for failing to mention Omar in his first tweeted comment. Hours later, his campaign shared video of him describing Trump\u2019s tweet in South Carolina on Saturday morning as \u201can incitement to violence against Congresswoman Omar, against our fellow Americans who happen to be Muslim.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s actions are an incitement to violence against Rep. Omar and Muslim Americans across the country. There is a cost and consequence to this rhetoric. Members of both parties must stand together and condemn the president's dangerous actions. pic.twitter.com/GV5l2qLf0Q\n\u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) April 13, 2019\nPerhaps the least supportive comment came from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, whose statement seemed to accept the Republicans\u2019 false claim that Omar was somehow guilty of \u201cminimizing\u201d the pain of the attack\u2019s victims or families.\nAs a Senator who represents 9/11 victims, I can't accept any minimizing of that pain. But Trump's dangerous rhetoric against @IlhanMN is disgusting. It\u2019s a false choice to suggest we can\u2019t fight terrorism and reject Islamophobic hate at once\u2014a president should do both.\n\u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) April 13, 2019\nSen. Cory Booker, who initially released no statement, denounced Trump\u2019s attack on Omar in an interview with CBS News recorded on Saturday and broadcast Sunday morning.\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, who responded to Trump directly last week when the president mocked him, was the only likely candidate to offer no comment. Biden\u2019s silence was made even more obvious by the fact that another possible contender who has yet to decide on a run, Stacey Abrams, did release a strong statement of support for Omar.\nOur country is made better by Rep. Ilhan Omar\u2019s voice and leadership in Congress. I am thankful for her courage and praying for her safety.\nAll Americans of good conscience must stand with the Muslim community & speak up against anti-Muslim bigotry stoked by inciteful rhetoric.\n\u2014 Stacey Abrams (@staceyabrams) April 13, 2019\nPelosi\u2019s first mild rebuke of Trump was far less supportive of Omar than statements from several of her colleagues, including Rep. James Clyburn, the Democratic whip.\nEnough is enough. No more silence, with NY Post and now Trump taking Ilhan\u2019s words out of context to incite violence toward her, it\u2019s time for more Dems to speak up. Clearly the GOP is fine with this shameful stunt, but we cannot stand by.\n\u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) April 12, 2019\nMembers of Congress have a duty to respond to the President\u2019s explicit attack today.@IlhanMN\u2019s life is in danger. For our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress.\nWe must speak out.\n\u201cFirst they came...\u201d pic.twitter.com/ygOX1vhE9j\n\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 12, 2019\nPresident Trump understands the weight his words carry. His tweet about Congresswoman Ilhan Omar puts her life & her family\u2019s lives at risk. Our outrage should be nonpartisan. That it\u2019s not will only give him license to continue to incite violence.\n\u2014 Rep. Joe Kennedy III (@RepJoeKennedy) April 13, 2019\nThe President\u2019s hateful, anti-Muslim attack on Congresswoman Omar is disgusting & dangerous.\nThose enabling him ought to be ashamed. They are using 9/11 as a political ploy & it is just plain wrong. But they will not divide us. We have your back, @Ilhan.\n\u2014 Rep. Jim McGovern (@RepMcGovern) April 13, 2019\nRep. Jerry Nadler, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, told CNN on Sunday that he was not troubled by Omar\u2019s reference to the attacks, as Pelosi seemed to be, and lambasted Trump for taking a post-9/11 grant meant to aid small business owners in the area. \u201cHe stole $150,000 from small businessperson\u201d Nadler said. \u201cHe has no moral authority to be talking about 9/11. At. All.\u201d\nBefore Pelosi\u2019s second statement on Sunday, the lack of a stronger response from the Democratic leadership in Congress \u2014 and no comment at all from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2014 had led Rep. Rashida Tlaib to accuse the party of using its Muslim congresspeople as props, without giving them adequate support against bad-faith attacks from Republicans.\nThey put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse. However, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for & why we ran in the first place, we are ignored. To truly honor our diversity is to never silence us. https://t.co/7T1OlwS1YG\n\u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) April 13, 2019\nUpdate: April 15, 7:00 a.m. ET\nThis story was updated to clarify the origins of the attack on Rep. Ilhan Omar and to add new statements released on Sunday from Omar and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\nWait!

                "html": "<p><u>An American doctor</u> who conducted several medical and mental health evaluations of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange inside Ecuador&rsquo;s Embassy in London over the last two years says that she believes she was spied on and that the confidentiality of her doctor-patient relationship with Assange was violated.</p>\n<p>Dr. Sondra Crosby, an associate professor of medicine and public health at Boston University and an expert on the physical and psychological impact of torture, has evaluated detainees held by the United States, including at its prison in Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba. She quietly began meeting with and evaluating Assange in 2017 inside the embassy where he had sought refuge.</p>\n<p>During her last session with Assange on February 23, Crosby says that her confidential medical notes were removed when she briefly left the embassy to get food to bring back to Assange who, she wrote, &ldquo;had not eaten.&rdquo; The notes were taken from where she had been evaluating Assange and only later discovered in another space used by the embassy&rsquo;s surveillance staff.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mr. Assange&rsquo;s right to doctor-patient confidentiality was violated, and his confidential information had been breached,&rdquo; Crosby wrote in a March 1 affidavit she gave to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. In her affidavit, she states that her medical notes were &ldquo;presumably&rdquo; read by embassy personnel.</p>\n<p>She also says that her medical visit with Assange in February was monitored by two cameras, and that she had to speak with Assange &ldquo;over the noise of a radio playing&rdquo; to mask their conversations because of what he said were listening devices in the room.</p>\n<p>In addition, when she returned to the embassy after getting food, she was questioned by embassy security staff and asked for a copy of her medical license, even though she had earlier provided her passport and explained the purpose of her visit.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The hostile, nonconfidential, and intimidating environment was palpable,&rdquo; she wrote in her affidavit.</p>\n<p>In an April 8 letter sent to both U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet and Dunja Mijatovic, the commissioner for human rights for the Council of Europe, Crosby added that during her February visit to the embassy, the conditions of Assange&rsquo;s confinement had significantly worsened since her first visit in 2017. Her letter noted the severe psychological toll Assange suffered in his prolonged and indefinite confinement.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mr. Assange&rsquo;s situation [inside the embassy] differs from a typical prisoner in a conventional prison,&rdquo; she wrote in her letter. &ldquo;In fact, his position is worse than a conventional prison in many respects. His confinement is indefinite and uncertain, which increases chronic stress and its myriad of chronic physical and serious psychological risks, including suicide.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>During seven years of confinement, Assange had suffered &ldquo;a number of serious deleterious effects of sunlight deprivation,&rdquo; she wrote, including &ldquo;neuropsychological impairment, weakened bones, decreased immune function, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer.&rdquo; He also displayed physical and psychological symptoms as a result of &ldquo;prolonged social isolation and sensory deprivation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I believe the psychological, physical, and social [aftereffects] will be long-lasting and severe,&rdquo; Crosby wrote.</p>\n<p>Assange was expelled from the Ecuadorian Embassy and <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/04/11/julian-assange-arrested-london-ecuador-withdraws-asylum/\">arrested by</a> British authorities on April 11, three days after her letter was sent to the U.N. and the Council of Europe. He is now in prison in Britain on charges of jumping bail, but also faces an indictment in the United States on a hacking charge in connection with the 2010 publication of classified U.S. documents obtained from former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Assange has been charged in the U.S. with trying to help Manning crack a government password; he also faces the possibility of a <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/04/12/julian-assange-rape-sweden/\">renewed investigation</a> by Sweden into sexual assault charges. His lawyers have vowed to fight his extradition.</p>\n<p>Assange sought refuge in Ecuador&rsquo;s Embassy in 2012, when Sweden was seeking his extradition in the sexual assault case, and remained in the embassy until his arrest last Thursday. British officials repeatedly vowed to arrest him for jumping bail if he ever set foot outside the embassy.</p>\n<p>In 2012, when Ecuador agreed to give Assange refuge, the country had a leftist president, Rafael Correa, who was sympathetic to the WikiLeaks founder. But Ecuador&rsquo;s current president, Len&iacute;n Moreno, has been far less tolerant of Assange and grew impatient with his presence in the embassy.</p>\n<p>Both before and since his arrest and expulsion from the embassy, Assange has been criticized and mocked for his erratic behavior. But Crosby&rsquo;s observations and statements make it clear that he has suffered severe psychological harm.</p>\n<p>Crosby wrote in her letter to the U.N. and the Council of Europe that Assange suffered from &ldquo;multiple medical conditions&rdquo; that had become &ldquo;more complex and urgent&rdquo; over the two years she had evaluated him. &ldquo;He has no ability to access necessary medical care, and he does not have access to the outdoors and sunlight. Even minimum standards for prisoners dictate at least one hour of sunlight daily and access to natural light.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While the British government and Assange&rsquo;s many critics say that it was his choice to stay in the embassy, Crosby argues that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/24/julian-assange-care-wikileaks-ecuadorian-embassy\">Assange was denied the fundamental right to health care that should have been afforded to him as a refugee</a>.</p>\n<p>In her April 8 letter, Crosby wrote that the &ldquo;highest priority&rdquo; for Assange&rsquo;s medical care was his &ldquo;critical need for an oral surgery procedure,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;the severe daily pain&rdquo; from his dental condition is &ldquo;inhumane.&rdquo; She had consulted with a dentist who had examined Assange, she wrote, and learned that the dental surgery could not be performed in the embassy. In her letter, Crosby says that the British government had repeatedly rejected requests to give Assange safe passage to a hospital for treatment.</p>\n<p>In addition to Crosby, Dr. Brock Chisholm, a British clinical psychologist who was previously retained as an expert witness in a case involving allegations of torture at CIA black sites, evaluated Assange over the past two years. Dr. Sean Love, now at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, initially met with Assange and arranged for an introduction to Crosby and Chisholm, but did not conduct any of the evaluations. Love said that Assange and WikiLeaks gave the doctors permission to make Crosby&rsquo;s affidavit and letter public.</p>\n<p>Love criticized the British government for denying Assange medical care while he was in the embassy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Whatever you think of his politics, he is a human being,&rdquo; Love said, &ldquo;and under international law, he deserved to be treated fairly and not in cruel or inhumane ways.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Wait!

                "text": "An American doctor who conducted several medical and mental health evaluations of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange inside Ecuador\u2019s Embassy in London over the last two years says that she believes she was spied on and that the confidentiality of her doctor-patient relationship with Assange was violated.\nDr. Sondra Crosby, an associate professor of medicine and public health at Boston University and an expert on the physical and psychological impact of torture, has evaluated detainees held by the United States, including at its prison in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. She quietly began meeting with and evaluating Assange in 2017 inside the embassy where he had sought refuge.\nDuring her last session with Assange on February 23, Crosby says that her confidential medical notes were removed when she briefly left the embassy to get food to bring back to Assange who, she wrote, \u201chad not eaten.\u201d The notes were taken from where she had been evaluating Assange and only later discovered in another space used by the embassy\u2019s surveillance staff.\n\u201cMr. Assange\u2019s right to doctor-patient confidentiality was violated, and his confidential information had been breached,\u201d Crosby wrote in a March 1 affidavit she gave to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. In her affidavit, she states that her medical notes were \u201cpresumably\u201d read by embassy personnel.\nShe also says that her medical visit with Assange in February was monitored by two cameras, and that she had to speak with Assange \u201cover the noise of a radio playing\u201d to mask their conversations because of what he said were listening devices in the room.\nIn addition, when she returned to the embassy after getting food, she was questioned by embassy security staff and asked for a copy of her medical license, even though she had earlier provided her passport and explained the purpose of her visit.\n\u201cThe hostile, nonconfidential, and intimidating environment was palpable,\u201d she wrote in her affidavit.\nIn an April 8 letter sent to both U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet and Dunja Mijatovic, the commissioner for human rights for the Council of Europe, Crosby added that during her February visit to the embassy, the conditions of Assange\u2019s confinement had significantly worsened since her first visit in 2017. Her letter noted the severe psychological toll Assange suffered in his prolonged and indefinite confinement.\n\u201cMr. Assange\u2019s situation [inside the embassy] differs from a typical prisoner in a conventional prison,\u201d she wrote in her letter. \u201cIn fact, his position is worse than a conventional prison in many respects. His confinement is indefinite and uncertain, which increases chronic stress and its myriad of chronic physical and serious psychological risks, including suicide.\u201d\nDuring seven years of confinement, Assange had suffered \u201ca number of serious deleterious effects of sunlight deprivation,\u201d she wrote, including \u201cneuropsychological impairment, weakened bones, decreased immune function, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer.\u201d He also displayed physical and psychological symptoms as a result of \u201cprolonged social isolation and sensory deprivation.\u201d\n\u201cI believe the psychological, physical, and social [aftereffects] will be long-lasting and severe,\u201d Crosby wrote.\nAssange was expelled from the Ecuadorian Embassy and arrested by British authorities on April 11, three days after her letter was sent to the U.N. and the Council of Europe. He is now in prison in Britain on charges of jumping bail, but also faces an indictment in the United States on a hacking charge in connection with the 2010 publication of classified U.S. documents obtained from former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Assange has been charged in the U.S. with trying to help Manning crack a government password; he also faces the possibility of a renewed investigation by Sweden into sexual assault charges. His lawyers have vowed to fight his extradition.\nAssange sought refuge in Ecuador\u2019s Embassy in 2012, when Sweden was seeking his extradition in the sexual assault case, and remained in the embassy until his arrest last Thursday. British officials repeatedly vowed to arrest him for jumping bail if he ever set foot outside the embassy.\nIn 2012, when Ecuador agreed to give Assange refuge, the country had a leftist president, Rafael Correa, who was sympathetic to the WikiLeaks founder. But Ecuador\u2019s current president, Len\u00edn Moreno, has been far less tolerant of Assange and grew impatient with his presence in the embassy.\nBoth before and since his arrest and expulsion from the embassy, Assange has been criticized and mocked for his erratic behavior. But Crosby\u2019s observations and statements make it clear that he has suffered severe psychological harm.\nCrosby wrote in her letter to the U.N. and the Council of Europe that Assange suffered from \u201cmultiple medical conditions\u201d that had become \u201cmore complex and urgent\u201d over the two years she had evaluated him. \u201cHe has no ability to access necessary medical care, and he does not have access to the outdoors and sunlight. Even minimum standards for prisoners dictate at least one hour of sunlight daily and access to natural light.\u201d\nWhile the British government and Assange\u2019s many critics say that it was his choice to stay in the embassy, Crosby argues that Assange was denied the fundamental right to health care that should have been afforded to him as a refugee.\nIn her April 8 letter, Crosby wrote that the \u201chighest priority\u201d for Assange\u2019s medical care was his \u201ccritical need for an oral surgery procedure,\u201d adding that \u201cthe severe daily pain\u201d from his dental condition is \u201cinhumane.\u201d She had consulted with a dentist who had examined Assange, she wrote, and learned that the dental surgery could not be performed in the embassy. In her letter, Crosby says that the British government had repeatedly rejected requests to give Assange safe passage to a hospital for treatment.\nIn addition to Crosby, Dr. Brock Chisholm, a British clinical psychologist who was previously retained as an expert witness in a case involving allegations of torture at CIA black sites, evaluated Assange over the past two years. Dr. Sean Love, now at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, initially met with Assange and arranged for an introduction to Crosby and Chisholm, but did not conduct any of the evaluations. Love said that Assange and WikiLeaks gave the doctors permission to make Crosby\u2019s affidavit and letter public.\nLove criticized the British government for denying Assange medical care while he was in the embassy.\n\u201cWhatever you think of his politics, he is a human being,\u201d Love said, \u201cand under international law, he deserved to be treated fairly and not in cruel or inhumane ways.\u201d\nWait!

                "html": "<p><u>Since the brutal</u> murder of Saudi dissident and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi last October, Congress has increasingly pressured the Trump administration to stop backing the Saudi Arabia-led coalition fighting in Yemen and halt U.S. arms sales to Riyadh. In response, President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that if the U.S. does not sell weapons to the Saudis, they will turn to U.S. adversaries to supply their arsenals.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the concept of stopping an investment of $110 billion into the United States,&rdquo; Trump <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/11/trump-getting-closer-khashoggi-893494\">told reporters in October</a>, referring to a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=glenn+kessler+110+billion+saudi&oq=glenn+kessler+110+billion+saudi&aqs=chrome..69i57.3315j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">collection of intent letters</a> signed with the Saudis in the early months of his presidency. &ldquo;You know what they are going to do? They&rsquo;re going to take that money and spend it in Russia or China or someplace else.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But a highly classified document produced by the French Directorate of Military Intelligence shows that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are overwhelmingly dependent on Western-produced weapon systems to wage their devastating war in Yemen. Many of the systems listed are only compatible with munitions, spare parts, and communications systems produced in NATO countries, meaning that the Saudis and UAE would have to replace large portions of their arsenals to continue with Russian or Chinese weapons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/collections/making-a-killing/\"><figure><img alt=\"Making a Killing\" src=\"https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/10/saudi-collection-promo-1540416194-promo.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&fit=crop&w=440&h=220\"></img></figure></a></p>\n<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just swap out the missiles that are used in U.S. planes for suddenly using Chinese and Russian missiles,&rdquo; said Rachel Stohl, managing director of the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, D.C. &ldquo;It takes decades to build your air force. It&rsquo;s not something you do in one fell swoop.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Saudi-led bombing campaign in North Yemen primarily relies on three types of aircraft: American F-15s, British EF-2000 Typhoons, and European Tornado fighters. The Saudis fly American Apache and Black Hawk helicopters into Yemen from military bases in Saudi Arabia, as well as the French AS-532 Cougar. They have lined the Saudi-Yemen border with American Abrams and French AMX 30 tanks, reinforced by at least five types of Western-made artillery guns. And the coalition blockade, which is aimed at cutting off aid to the Houthi rebels but has also interfered with humanitarian aid shipments, relies on U.S., French, and German models of attack ships with, as well as two types of French naval helicopters.</p>\n<p>The catalogue of weapon systems is just one revelation in the classified report, which was obtained by the French investigative news organization Disclose and is being published in full by The Intercept, Disclose, and four other French media organizations. The report also harshly criticizes Saudi military capabilities in Yemen, describing the Saudis as operating &ldquo;ineffectively&rdquo; and characterizing their efforts to secure their border with Yemen as &ldquo;a failure.&rdquo; And it suggests that U.S. assistance with Saudi targeting in Yemen may go beyond what has previously been acknowledged.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the war, the U.S. has backed the coalition bombing campaign with weapons sales and, until recently, midair refueling support for aircraft. But the French report suggests that U.S. drones may also be helping with Saudi munitions targeting.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If the RSAF benefits from American support, in the form of advice in the field of targeting, the practice of Close Air Support (CAS) is recent and appears poorly understood by these crews,&rdquo; the document says. A footnote after the word &ldquo;targeting&rdquo; specifies that the possible U.S. &ldquo;advice&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;targeting effectuated by American drones.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Though the U.S. has denied engaging directly in hostilities against the Houthis, American MQ-9 Reaper drones &ndash; a reconnaissance drone with hunt-and-kill capabilities &ndash; have flown over Houthi occupied territory. After the Houthis shot down one of the drones in October 2017, it led to <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2017/10/02/us-mq-9-drone-shot-down-in-yemen/\">speculation</a> that the U.S. could be using them to collect intelligence for the Saudis. Targeting being effectuated by American drones could mean that U.S. drones play a more active role in coalition targeting, like laser-sighting precision-guided munitions drops, for example.</p>\n<p>U.S. Central Command strongly denied that U.S. drones have any operational role in coalition targeting. &ldquo;The U.S. military does not provide that type of support to the Saudi-led coalition,&rdquo; a CENTCOM spokesperson told The Intercept by email. &ldquo;Our role with the Saudi-led coalition is advisory only. We provide intelligence and advise the coalition on best practices, air-to-ground space awareness, and the law of armed conflict.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"French-made Leclerc tanks of the Saudi-led coalition are deployed on the outskirts of the southern Yemeni port city of Aden on August 3, 2015, during a military operation against Shiite Huthi rebels and their allies.

Its publication is likely to have significant political implications for the Macron government, which has steadfastly defended arms sales to Saudi Arabia, while simultaneously downplaying its own knowledge of how French weapons are used in Yemen.</p>\n<p>In January, Parly told a host on <a href=\"https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/secrets-d-info/secrets-d-info-02-fevrier-2019\">France Inter</a>, a major French public radio station, that she had &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/questions-politiques/questions-politiques-20-janvier-2019\">no knowledge as to whether [French] weapons are being used directly in this conflict</a>,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;we have recently sold no weapons that could be used in the course of the Yemen conflict.&rdquo; She has also <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20181030-yemen-war-must-stop-french-defence-minister-says\">told journalists</a> that French weapons &ldquo;have not been used against civilians,&rdquo; and described the country&rsquo;s weapons exports as &ldquo;relatively modest,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t sell weapons like they&rsquo;re baguettes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But the report shows that the Saudis and Emiratis have made much wider use French military hardware than the French government has admitted. Since the war began in 2015, the coalition has used French tanks and armored vehicles to reinforce the Saudi border and defend Emirati military outposts in Yemen. The Saudis have stationed French long-range artillery guns along its border, capable of firing deep into Yemen&rsquo;s northern governorates, while the Emiratis have piloted French multiengine fighter planes, equipped with French laser-targeting technology. And both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have used French warships to enforce the coalition blockade against the country.</p>\n<p>Though the report lists the French arms used by Saudi Arabia and the and UAE, it consistently notes that French intelligence has not observed the same weapons on &ldquo;active fronts&rdquo; with coalition ground forces, which are largely made up of Yemeni fighters loyal to former President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, as well as foreign mercenaries. One map notes the presence of French Leclerc tanks at a coalition base near the battle of Hodeidah, but the report also says that the UAE uses Leclerc tanks generally for defensive purposes.</p>\n<p>In response to a detailed list of questions sent by Disclose, the French prime minister&rsquo;s office sent a lengthy statement about France&rsquo;s arms sales and its alliance with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The statement says that French arms sales are thoroughly reviewed and consistent with French and international law.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;France is a responsible and reliable partner,&rdquo; the statement reads. &ldquo;Offensive actions are regularly taken from Yemen against the territory of our regional partners &ndash; we have seen this with ballistic missile attacks or drones carrying explosives, for example. France maintains a constant dialogue with these partners to respond to their defense needs.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It continues: &ldquo;Moreover, to our knowledge, the French weapons available to the members of the coalition are mostly placed in a defensive position, outside Yemeni territory or on coalition holdings, but not on the front line, and we are not aware of civilian casualties resulting from their use in Yemeni theater.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At no point does the report assess whether French arms have been used against civilians. One map, however, estimates that more than 430,000 Yemeni people live within range of French artillery guns on the Saudi-Yemen border.</p>\n<p>The report is primarily concerned with the location of French weapons among coalition forces and says nothing about origin of Houthi weapons, some of which are known to have come from Iran. An appendix catalogues the major weapon systems used by the Saudis and Emiratis, but is not a complete list; it does not mention munitions, rifles, or several types of <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/02/yemen-uae-recklessly-supplying-militias-with-windfall-of-western-arms/\">armored vehicles</a> spotted by monitoring groups.</p>\n<p>Overall, the appendix reinforces a point that observers of the war have made since the intervention began: that the military capability of the coalition has been created and sustained almost entirely by the global arms trade. In addition to the U.S., the U.K., and France, the report mentions radar and detection systems from Sweden; Austrian Camcopter drones; defensive naval rockets from South Korea, Italian warships, and even rocket launcher batteries from Brazil.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"HODEIDAH, YEMEN - SEPTEMBER 21: Yemeni fighters aligned with Yemen's Saudi-led coalition-backed government, man a frontline position at Kilo 16, an area which contains the main supply route linking Hodeidah city to the rebel-held capital Sanaa, on September 21, 2018 in Hodeidah, Yemen.

The only non-NATO aircraft mentioned in the report is the Wing Loong, a Reaper drone knockoff produced by the Chinese. Export controls have prevented the U.S. from selling armed drones to the UAE, so Abu Dhabi <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/21/pentagon-is-scrambling-as-china-sells-the-hell-out-of-armed-drones-to-americas-allies.html\">turned to China</a> to acquire them. Last year, the UAE used a Chinese drone to <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/\">kill Saleh al-Samad</a>, president of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, who was widely viewed as an advocate for engaging in the U.N.-led peace process.</p>\n<p>Despite their vast technological superiority, the Saudis in particular are failing to meet their military objectives, the report says, identifying Saudi targeting as in need of improvement. And it describes the Saudis as less effective participants in air and sea missions, noting that the Emiratis are largely responsible for the blockade. It speaks more favorably of Emirati pilots, saying that they have a &ldquo;proven&rdquo; ability to use guided munitions, and that they perform up to NATO standards during bombing missions.</p>\n<p>The report opens with a discussion of the battle to retake Hodeidah, a port city on the Red Sea and the entry point for most commercial goods and humanitarian aid into Yemen. The UAE predicted a decisive victory in Hodeidah, where fighting began last summer. But the intelligence report assessed that the &ldquo;taking by force of [Hodeidah] appears still out of reach&rdquo; for UAE-backed militias, despite their having nearly twice as many forces on the ground as their adversaries at the time it was written. However, the report notes them slowly moving to encircle and besiege the city by trying to retake critical junctions on the road between Hodeidah and Sana&rsquo;a, the capital, which the Houthis control.</p>\n<p>Before the offensive began, humanitarian groups <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/06/16/yemen-foreign-policy-united-states/\">identified a protracted siege</a> as a worst-case scenario because it could largely stop the flow of aid to some of the regions of the country most in need.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Commercial and humanitarian shipments coming through Hodeidah port are a lifeline, not just for people in Hodeidah city, but for much of Yemen,&rdquo; said Scott Paul, a humanitarian policy lead at Oxfam America. &ldquo;Setting up a long-term front-line and siege on the perimeter of the city would have a dramatic impact on national commodities markets and endanger anyone struggling to pay for basic necessities like food, fuel, and medicine.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Despite calls from aid groups, the U.S. did not pressure the Emiratis to back off the attack. One U.S. official told the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-deepens-role-in-yemen-fight-offers-gulf-allies-airstrike-target-assistance-1528830371\">Wall Street Journal</a> that U.S. policy was to display a &ldquo;blinking yellow light of caution,&rdquo; and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/06/283116.htm\">statement</a> asking parties to respect the &ldquo;free flow of humanitarian aid&rdquo; but stopping short of calling on coalition forces to back off.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"ADEN, YEMEN - SEPTEMBER 23: Humedan Hussin Abdullah, sits with father at a government hospital bed on September 23, 2018 in Aden, Yemen.

Aid groups also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security/yemeni-civilians-trapped-by-hodeidah-fighting-aid-groups-say-idUSKCN1NA2A2\">sounded the alarm</a> about thousands of civilians who were trapped because of the fighting. An internationally brokered ceasefire in December slowed the pace of coalition airstrikes, but the ceasefire broke down in January and violence resumed.</p>\n<p>The French intelligence report also describes a massive operation by the Saudis to secure their border with Yemen, and says that five brigades of the Saudi army and two brigades of the Saudi National Guard &mdash; about 25,000 men &mdash; are deployed along the border. The troops are reinforced by 300 tanks and a battalion of 48 French-made Caesar self-propelled Howitzer guns capable of firing dozens of miles into Yemeni territory.</p>\n<p>The &ldquo;unspoken goal&rdquo; of this border operation is to penetrate Houthi-controlled areas and eventually advance on Houthi strongholds in the Yemeni governorate of Saada, the report says. But it says the Saudis&rsquo; lack of mobility leaves them highly vulnerable to guerrilla attacks and that their strikes are too imprecise be effective against the nimbler Houthi forces.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Despite the defensive means deployed, the rebels maintain their nuisance capability: artillery salvos, missile shots, improvised explosive devices, ambushes and infiltrations into Saudi territory,&rdquo; the report says. &ldquo;The addition of infantry combat vehicles in empty spaces between the tanks, in the summer of 2016, did not allow for an improvement in the efficiency of Saudi tactics.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://disclose.ngo/en\">Disclose</a> is the first nonprofit newsroom of investigative journalism in France.

                "text": "Since the brutal murder of Saudi dissident and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi last October, Congress has increasingly pressured the Trump administration to stop backing the Saudi Arabia-led coalition fighting in Yemen and halt U.S. arms sales to Riyadh. In response, President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that if the U.S. does not sell weapons to the Saudis, they will turn to U.S. adversaries to supply their arsenals.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the concept of stopping an investment of $110 billion into the United States,\u201d Trump told reporters in October, referring to a collection of intent letters signed with the Saudis in the early months of his presidency. \u201cYou know what they are going to do? They\u2019re going to take that money and spend it in Russia or China or someplace else.\u201d\nBut a highly classified document produced by the French Directorate of Military Intelligence shows that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are overwhelmingly dependent on Western-produced weapon systems to wage their devastating war in Yemen. Many of the systems listed are only compatible with munitions, spare parts, and communications systems produced in NATO countries, meaning that the Saudis and UAE would have to replace large portions of their arsenals to continue with Russian or Chinese weapons.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just swap out the missiles that are used in U.S. planes for suddenly using Chinese and Russian missiles,\u201d said Rachel Stohl, managing director of the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, D.C. \u201cIt takes decades to build your air force. It\u2019s not something you do in one fell swoop.\u201d\nThe Saudi-led bombing campaign in North Yemen primarily relies on three types of aircraft: American F-15s, British EF-2000 Typhoons, and European Tornado fighters. The Saudis fly American Apache and Black Hawk helicopters into Yemen from military bases in Saudi Arabia, as well as the French AS-532 Cougar. They have lined the Saudi-Yemen border with American Abrams and French AMX 30 tanks, reinforced by at least five types of Western-made artillery guns. And the coalition blockade, which is aimed at cutting off aid to the Houthi rebels but has also interfered with humanitarian aid shipments, relies on U.S., French, and German models of attack ships with, as well as two types of French naval helicopters.\nThe catalogue of weapon systems is just one revelation in the classified report, which was obtained by the French investigative news organization Disclose and is being published in full by The Intercept, Disclose, and four other French media organizations. The report also harshly criticizes Saudi military capabilities in Yemen, describing the Saudis as operating \u201cineffectively\u201d and characterizing their efforts to secure their border with Yemen as \u201ca failure.\u201d And it suggests that U.S. assistance with Saudi targeting in Yemen may go beyond what has previously been acknowledged.\nSince the beginning of the war, the U.S. has backed the coalition bombing campaign with weapons sales and, until recently, midair refueling support for aircraft. But the French report suggests that U.S. drones may also be helping with Saudi munitions targeting.\n\u201cIf the RSAF benefits from American support, in the form of advice in the field of targeting, the practice of Close Air Support (CAS) is recent and appears poorly understood by these crews,\u201d the document says. A footnote after the word \u201ctargeting\u201d specifies that the possible U.S. \u201cadvice\u201d refers to \u201ctargeting effectuated by American drones.\u201d\nThough the U.S. has denied engaging directly in hostilities against the Houthis, American MQ-9 Reaper drones \u2013 a reconnaissance drone with hunt-and-kill capabilities \u2013 have flown over Houthi occupied territory. After the Houthis shot down one of the drones in October 2017, it led to speculation that the U.S. could be using them to collect intelligence for the Saudis. Targeting being effectuated by American drones could mean that U.S. drones play a more active role in coalition targeting, like laser-sighting precision-guided munitions drops, for example.\nU.S. Central Command strongly denied that U.S. drones have any operational role in coalition targeting. \u201cThe U.S. military does not provide that type of support to the Saudi-led coalition,\u201d a CENTCOM spokesperson told The Intercept by email. \u201cOur role with the Saudi-led coalition is advisory only. We provide intelligence and advise the coalition on best practices, air-to-ground space awareness, and the law of armed conflict.\u201d\nPhoto: Saleh Al-Obeidi/AFP/Getty Images\nDated September 25, 2018, the report was written to brief an October meeting of the French \u201crestricted council,\u201d a meeting of cabinet-level officials that included French President Emmanuel Macron, Minister of the Armed Forces Florence Parly, and Minister of European and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian. Its publication is likely to have significant political implications for the Macron government, which has steadfastly defended arms sales to Saudi Arabia, while simultaneously downplaying its own knowledge of how French weapons are used in Yemen.\nIn January, Parly told a host on France Inter, a major French public radio station, that she had \u201cno knowledge as to whether [French] weapons are being used directly in this conflict,\u201d and that \u201cwe have recently sold no weapons that could be used in the course of the Yemen conflict.\u201d She has also told journalists that French weapons \u201chave not been used against civilians,\u201d and described the country\u2019s weapons exports as \u201crelatively modest,\u201d adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t sell weapons like they\u2019re baguettes.\u201d\nBut the report shows that the Saudis and Emiratis have made much wider use French military hardware than the French government has admitted. Since the war began in 2015, the coalition has used French tanks and armored vehicles to reinforce the Saudi border and defend Emirati military outposts in Yemen. The Saudis have stationed French long-range artillery guns along its border, capable of firing deep into Yemen\u2019s northern governorates, while the Emiratis have piloted French multiengine fighter planes, equipped with French laser-targeting technology. And both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have used French warships to enforce the coalition blockade against the country.\nThough the report lists the French arms used by Saudi Arabia and the and UAE, it consistently notes that French intelligence has not observed the same weapons on \u201cactive fronts\u201d with coalition ground forces, which are largely made up of Yemeni fighters loyal to former President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, as well as foreign mercenaries. One map notes the presence of French Leclerc tanks at a coalition base near the battle of Hodeidah, but the report also says that the UAE uses Leclerc tanks generally for defensive purposes.\nIn response to a detailed list of questions sent by Disclose, the French prime minister\u2019s office sent a lengthy statement about France\u2019s arms sales and its alliance with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The statement says that French arms sales are thoroughly reviewed and consistent with French and international law.\n\u201cFrance is a responsible and reliable partner,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOffensive actions are regularly taken from Yemen against the territory of our regional partners \u2013 we have seen this with ballistic missile attacks or drones carrying explosives, for example. France maintains a constant dialogue with these partners to respond to their defense needs.\u201d\nIt continues: \u201cMoreover, to our knowledge, the French weapons available to the members of the coalition are mostly placed in a defensive position, outside Yemeni territory or on coalition holdings, but not on the front line, and we are not aware of civilian casualties resulting from their use in Yemeni theater.\u201d\nAt no point does the report assess whether French arms have been used against civilians. One map, however, estimates that more than 430,000 Yemeni people live within range of French artillery guns on the Saudi-Yemen border.\nThe report is primarily concerned with the location of French weapons among coalition forces and says nothing about origin of Houthi weapons, some of which are known to have come from Iran. An appendix catalogues the major weapon systems used by the Saudis and Emiratis, but is not a complete list; it does not mention munitions, rifles, or several types of armored vehicles spotted by monitoring groups.\nOverall, the appendix reinforces a point that observers of the war have made since the intervention began: that the military capability of the coalition has been created and sustained almost entirely by the global arms trade. In addition to the U.S., the U.K., and France, the report mentions radar and detection systems from Sweden; Austrian Camcopter drones; defensive naval rockets from South Korea, Italian warships, and even rocket launcher batteries from Brazil.\nYemeni fighters aligned with the Saudi-led coalition-backed government man a frontline position at Kilo 16, an area which contains the main supply route linking Hodeidah city to the rebel-held capital Sanaa, on Sept. 21, 2018.\nPhoto: Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images\nThe report describes the Saudi-led air war in Yemen as \u201ca campaign of massive and continuous airstrikes against territories held by the Houthi rebellion.\u201d The coalition carried out a total of 24,000 airstrikes from the beginning of the war through September 2018, according to the report \u2014 a number that falls within the range estimated by the Yemen Data Project, an independent monitoring group.\nFrench intelligence has observed five types of piloted fighters flying over Yemen, all of which are NATO aircraft. The only non-NATO aircraft mentioned in the report is the Wing Loong, a Reaper drone knockoff produced by the Chinese. Export controls have prevented the U.S. from selling armed drones to the UAE, so Abu Dhabi turned to China to acquire them. Last year, the UAE used a Chinese drone to kill Saleh al-Samad, president of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, who was widely viewed as an advocate for engaging in the U.N.-led peace process.\nDespite their vast technological superiority, the Saudis in particular are failing to meet their military objectives, the report says, identifying Saudi targeting as in need of improvement. And it describes the Saudis as less effective participants in air and sea missions, noting that the Emiratis are largely responsible for the blockade. It speaks more favorably of Emirati pilots, saying that they have a \u201cproven\u201d ability to use guided munitions, and that they perform up to NATO standards during bombing missions.\nThe report opens with a discussion of the battle to retake Hodeidah, a port city on the Red Sea and the entry point for most commercial goods and humanitarian aid into Yemen. The UAE predicted a decisive victory in Hodeidah, where fighting began last summer. But the intelligence report assessed that the \u201ctaking by force of [Hodeidah] appears still out of reach\u201d for UAE-backed militias, despite their having nearly twice as many forces on the ground as their adversaries at the time it was written. However, the report notes them slowly moving to encircle and besiege the city by trying to retake critical junctions on the road between Hodeidah and Sana\u2019a, the capital, which the Houthis control.\nBefore the offensive began, humanitarian groups identified a protracted siege as a worst-case scenario because it could largely stop the flow of aid to some of the regions of the country most in need.\n\u201cCommercial and humanitarian shipments coming through Hodeidah port are a lifeline, not just for people in Hodeidah city, but for much of Yemen,\u201d said Scott Paul, a humanitarian policy lead at Oxfam America. \u201cSetting up a long-term front-line and siege on the perimeter of the city would have a dramatic impact on national commodities markets and endanger anyone struggling to pay for basic necessities like food, fuel, and medicine.\u201d\nDespite calls from aid groups, the U.S. did not pressure the Emiratis to back off the attack. One U.S. official told the Wall Street Journal that U.S. policy was to display a \u201cblinking yellow light of caution,\u201d and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement asking parties to respect the \u201cfree flow of humanitarian aid\u201d but stopping short of calling on coalition forces to back off.\nPhoto: Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images\nHodeidah saw some of the worst fighting of 2018, and the Norwegian Refugee Council estimated a total of 2,325 civilian casualties as a result. Aid groups also sounded the alarm about thousands of civilians who were trapped because of the fighting. An internationally brokered ceasefire in December slowed the pace of coalition airstrikes, but the ceasefire broke down in January and violence resumed.\nThe French intelligence report also describes a massive operation by the Saudis to secure their border with Yemen, and says that five brigades of the Saudi army and two brigades of the Saudi National Guard \u2014 about 25,000 men \u2014 are deployed along the border. The troops are reinforced by 300 tanks and a battalion of 48 French-made Caesar self-propelled Howitzer guns capable of firing dozens of miles into Yemeni territory.\nThe \u201cunspoken goal\u201d of this border operation is to penetrate Houthi-controlled areas and eventually advance on Houthi strongholds in the Yemeni governorate of Saada, the report says. But it says the Saudis\u2019 lack of mobility leaves them highly vulnerable to guerrilla attacks and that their strikes are too imprecise be effective against the nimbler Houthi forces.\n\u201cDespite the defensive means deployed, the rebels maintain their nuisance capability: artillery salvos, missile shots, improvised explosive devices, ambushes and infiltrations into Saudi territory,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe addition of infantry combat vehicles in empty spaces between the tanks, in the summer of 2016, did not allow for an improvement in the efficiency of Saudi tactics.\u201d\nDisclose is the first nonprofit newsroom of investigative journalism in France.

                "html": "<p><u>After years of</u> ignoring the issue, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are suddenly engaged in a furious fight over enacting national legislation to establish basic online privacy rights for consumers. As with the crafting of much legislation dealing with complicated issues, legislators are relying on experts to help codify the consumer protections.</p>\n<p>In a twist that is all too familiar in Washington, D.C., however, many of the groups that have positioned themselves as expert voices on consumer privacy are pushing for a bill that hews closely to tech industry interests. Lawmakers who are famously ignorant on technology issues are hearing largely from an army of industry lobbyists and experts funded by social media companies, online platforms, data brokers, advertisers, and telecommunication giants &mdash; the very same corporate interests that profit from the collection and sale of internet data.</p>\n<p>Take the Center for Democracy and Technology, one of the most prominent privacy-centered Beltway think tanks. The group is considered to be well-respected among congressional staffers, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy-advocates-tell-senators-what-they-want-in-a-data-protection-law/\">routinely</a> testifies before committees on privacy legislation, and is a prime mover in the national online privacy bill discussion.</p>\n<p>Late last year, the organization circulated draft federal privacy legislation that would <a href=\"https://cdt.org/insight/cdts-federal-privacy-legislation-section-by-section-analysis-and-explanation/\">nullify</a> major state-level regulations. In March, when the Senate Judiciary Committee held its first hearing of the session on how to formulate a federal consumer privacy standard, the center&rsquo;s Privacy and Data Project Director Michelle Richardson testified.</p>\n<p>The Center for Democracy and Technology is also awash in corporate money from the tech sector. Amazon, Verizon, and Google are among the corporate donors that each provide over $200,000 to the group. AT&amp;T, Uber, and Twitter are also major donors.</p>\n<p>Last Wednesday, the group hosted its annual gala, known as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/techpromcdt?f=tweets&vertical=default&src=hash\">Tech Prom</a>,&rdquo; which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpencerOverton/status/1116141809586135040\">brought</a> together lobbyists and government affairs officials from leading Silicon Valley and telecom firms. Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft purchased tables at the event and served as sponsors, a privilege that came in exchange for a <a href=\"https://cdt.org/files/2019/03/Tech-Prom-2019-Sponsorships.pdf\">$35,000</a> donation to the center.</p>\n<p>These industry-funded think tanks are pushing legislation in a direction that would have weak enforcement mechanisms, give consumers limited means for recourse, and perhaps most importantly for the industry, roll back state-level privacy standards being enacted by state legislatures.</p>\n<p>The stakes of the online privacy fight could have ramifications the world over. American standards on data collection could shape political and business decisions across the world, said Jeff Chester, president of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy think tank that opposes overturning of state-level privacy laws.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica,&rdquo; Chester said. Cambridge Analytica was involved in a scandal when, while working on behalf of Donald Trump&rsquo;s presidential campaign, the data analytics firm illicitly scraped consumer data from Facebook in order to build advanced voter-targeting methods. The events stoked outrage over Facebook&rsquo;s security around its users&rsquo; private data.</p>\n<p>Chester said the money lavished by the tech industry on privacy think tanks was tantamount to funding lobbyists. &ldquo;These groups should not take a dime of corporate money. This is basically lobbying dollars,&rdquo; Chester said. &ldquo;I think every one of these groups working on privacy that takes corporate money should return it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, actual tech industry lobby groups are pushing federal legislation along the same lines as that proposed by the tech-funded think tanks. One of the largest lobbying groups for Silicon Valley, NetChoice, has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-30/tech-group-favors-privacy-bill-that-preempts-tougher-state-laws\">rallied behind</a> Sen. Marco Rubio&rsquo;s, R-Fla., privacy bill. His bill would roll back state regulation and place enforcement authority largely under the Federal Trade Commission, a notoriously toothless federal agency with no rule-making power, instead of letting consumers directly sue tech companies under the law.</p>\n<p>NetChoice lobbies on behalf of Facebook, Google, Twitter, Airbnb, and eBay, among other tech companies. (Pierre Omidyar, founder of The Intercept<em>&rsquo;</em>s parent company, First Look Media, is the chair of eBay.)</p>\n<p><u>The sudden moves</u> around online privacy kicked into high gear with a state-level privacy law that passed in California last year. In June 2018, state legislators passed California Consumer Privacy Act, a surprise turn of events that enshrined the strongest consumer privacy standard in the country.</p>\n<p>The law, set to take effect next year, gives California residents the power to view the types of data companies collect from them, request that the data be deleted, and allows residents to declare that their data not be sold to third parties. In response, similar bills are being proposed in several <a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/infosec/washington-privacy-law-1-1-1/\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=e453c554-8292-49a5-8203-a40ed60fe3ad\">states</a>.</p>\n<p>The lobbying push to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/08/theres-going-be-fight-here-weaken-it-inside-lobbying-war-over-californias-landmark-privacy-law/?utm_term=.3b84c6e96ab4\">water down</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2019/03/06/silicon-valley-lobbies-hard-to-kill-off.html\">overturn</a> the California law has been so intense that some federal legislators are raising questions about whether the urgency for a national standard is simply a vehicle for lobbyists to push pre-emption, provisions in the federal law that would supersede and roll back the state-level privacy laws.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are we here just because we don&rsquo;t like the California law, and we just want the federal pre-emption law to shut it down?&rdquo; asked Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., during one of the recent hearings on the bill.</p>\n<p>The Center for Democracy and Technology&rsquo;s proposal for a draft bill contained such a pre-emption provision. The proposed bill would overturn the California Consumer Privacy Act and the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which compels technology companies to obtain consent from customers before collecting biometric data, including fingerprints and facial recognition models. Both Google and Facebook could faced <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/01/28/facebook-face-scanning-bipa/\">lawsuits</a> under the Illinois law.</p>\n<p>The Center for Democracy and Technology&rsquo;s vice president for external affairs, Brian Wesolowski, defended the group&rsquo;s draft proposal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a stronger bill than the California one when it comes to the privacy rights of all,&rdquo; he said in an email to The Intercept, adding that the group maintains &ldquo;clear lines between funding and policy positions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The proposed draft from the Center for Democracy and Technology, however, does not reproduce the California law&rsquo;s right for consumers to opt out of data collection. The California law also provides consumers with what is called a private right of action &mdash; meaning that they can file a lawsuit if the state attorney general does not act when companies violate the law &mdash; while the Center for Democracy and Technology&rsquo;s draft simply calls for companies to respond to complaints within 30 days.</p>\n<p>Another think tank, the Center for Information Policy Leadership, which bills itself as a leading voice on privacy, has also called for a provision pre-empting state-level laws. In a memo for policymakers <a href=\"https://www.informationpolicycentre.com/uploads/5/7/1/0/57104281/cipl_principles_for_a_revised_us_privacy_framework__21_march_2019_.pdf\">released</a> last month, the group said the new federal bill should &ldquo;preempt a patchwork of inconsistent state laws.&rdquo; Similarly, another group, the Technology Policy Institute, has asked that a federal privacy law pre-empts state regulation and explicitly called for any new national standard to have &ldquo;fewer restrictions on the use of information.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Both groups receive funding from Amazon, Google, and Facebook &mdash; and both strongly defended their positions.</p>\n<p>Markus Heyder, a vice president at the Center for Information Policy Leadership, told The Intercept in an email, &ldquo;CIPL&rsquo;s mission is not to advocate specific industry positions, but to help develop globally consistent policies and approaches to privacy regulation that maximize both the appropriate protection of consumers from privacy risks and harms and reasonable data use and innovation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>David Fish, a spokesperson for the Technology Policy Institute, dismissed concerns about industry funding, noting that his group&rsquo;s position is &ldquo;not supported universally by industry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Just like NetChoice, the tech industry lobby group, the Center for Information Policy Leadership and the Center for Democracy and Technology have both called for a weak enforcement standard that rests largely with the Federal Trade Commission.</p>\n<p>The push for pre-emption, however, is not shared by all privacy and consumer think tanks. Electronic Privacy Information Center, Public Citizen, and U.S. Public Interest Research Group are among several major advocacy organizations that have demanded that any federal standard not pre-empt state privacy law. &ldquo;Federal privacy legislation that preempts stronger state laws would only benefit technology companies at the expense of the public,&rdquo; the groups wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/december-2018-preemption-letter\">letter</a> to lawmakers.</p>\n<p>Jeff Chester&rsquo;s group, the Center for Digital Democracy, also signed the letter demanding a redline on pre-emption. None of the four groups that signed the letter take corporate money.</p>\n<p>Wait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn&rsquo;t done it?

                "text": "After years of ignoring the issue, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are suddenly engaged in a furious fight over enacting national legislation to establish basic online privacy rights for consumers. As with the crafting of much legislation dealing with complicated issues, legislators are relying on experts to help codify the consumer protections.\nIn a twist that is all too familiar in Washington, D.C., however, many of the groups that have positioned themselves as expert voices on consumer privacy are pushing for a bill that hews closely to tech industry interests. Lawmakers who are famously ignorant on technology issues are hearing largely from an army of industry lobbyists and experts funded by social media companies, online platforms, data brokers, advertisers, and telecommunication giants \u2014 the very same corporate interests that profit from the collection and sale of internet data.\nTake the Center for Democracy and Technology, one of the most prominent privacy-centered Beltway think tanks. The group is considered to be well-respected among congressional staffers, routinely testifies before committees on privacy legislation, and is a prime mover in the national online privacy bill discussion.\nLate last year, the organization circulated draft federal privacy legislation that would nullify major state-level regulations. In March, when the Senate Judiciary Committee held its first hearing of the session on how to formulate a federal consumer privacy standard, the center\u2019s Privacy and Data Project Director Michelle Richardson testified.\nThe Center for Democracy and Technology is also awash in corporate money from the tech sector. Amazon, Verizon, and Google are among the corporate donors that each provide over $200,000 to the group. AT&T, Uber, and Twitter are also major donors.\nLast Wednesday, the group hosted its annual gala, known as \u201cTech Prom,\u201d which brought together lobbyists and government affairs officials from leading Silicon Valley and telecom firms. Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft purchased tables at the event and served as sponsors, a privilege that came in exchange for a $35,000 donation to the center.\nThese industry-funded think tanks are pushing legislation in a direction that would have weak enforcement mechanisms, give consumers limited means for recourse, and perhaps most importantly for the industry, roll back state-level privacy standards being enacted by state legislatures.\nThe stakes of the online privacy fight could have ramifications the world over. American standards on data collection could shape political and business decisions across the world, said Jeff Chester, president of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy think tank that opposes overturning of state-level privacy laws.\n\u201cThis is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica,\u201d Chester said. Cambridge Analytica was involved in a scandal when, while working on behalf of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, the data analytics firm illicitly scraped consumer data from Facebook in order to build advanced voter-targeting methods. The events stoked outrage over Facebook\u2019s security around its users\u2019 private data.\nChester said the money lavished by the tech industry on privacy think tanks was tantamount to funding lobbyists. \u201cThese groups should not take a dime of corporate money. This is basically lobbying dollars,\u201d Chester said. \u201cI think every one of these groups working on privacy that takes corporate money should return it.\u201d\nMeanwhile, actual tech industry lobby groups are pushing federal legislation along the same lines as that proposed by the tech-funded think tanks. One of the largest lobbying groups for Silicon Valley, NetChoice, has rallied behind Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s, R-Fla., privacy bill. His bill would roll back state regulation and place enforcement authority largely under the Federal Trade Commission, a notoriously toothless federal agency with no rule-making power, instead of letting consumers directly sue tech companies under the law.\nNetChoice lobbies on behalf of Facebook, Google, Twitter, Airbnb, and eBay, among other tech companies. (Pierre Omidyar, founder of The Intercept\u2019s parent company, First Look Media, is the chair of eBay.)\nThe sudden moves around online privacy kicked into high gear with a state-level privacy law that passed in California last year. In June 2018, state legislators passed California Consumer Privacy Act, a surprise turn of events that enshrined the strongest consumer privacy standard in the country.\nThe law, set to take effect next year, gives California residents the power to view the types of data companies collect from them, request that the data be deleted, and allows residents to declare that their data not be sold to third parties. In response, similar bills are being proposed in several other states.\nThe lobbying push to water down and overturn the California law has been so intense that some federal legislators are raising questions about whether the urgency for a national standard is simply a vehicle for lobbyists to push pre-emption, provisions in the federal law that would supersede and roll back the state-level privacy laws.\n\u201cAre we here just because we don\u2019t like the California law, and we just want the federal pre-emption law to shut it down?\u201d asked Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., during one of the recent hearings on the bill.\nThe Center for Democracy and Technology\u2019s proposal for a draft bill contained such a pre-emption provision. The proposed bill would overturn the California Consumer Privacy Act and the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which compels technology companies to obtain consent from customers before collecting biometric data, including fingerprints and facial recognition models. Both Google and Facebook could faced lawsuits under the Illinois law.\nThe Center for Democracy and Technology\u2019s vice president for external affairs, Brian Wesolowski, defended the group\u2019s draft proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s a stronger bill than the California one when it comes to the privacy rights of all,\u201d he said in an email to The Intercept, adding that the group maintains \u201cclear lines between funding and policy positions.\u201d\nThe proposed draft from the Center for Democracy and Technology, however, does not reproduce the California law\u2019s right for consumers to opt out of data collection. The California law also provides consumers with what is called a private right of action \u2014 meaning that they can file a lawsuit if the state attorney general does not act when companies violate the law \u2014 while the Center for Democracy and Technology\u2019s draft simply calls for companies to respond to complaints within 30 days.\nAnother think tank, the Center for Information Policy Leadership, which bills itself as a leading voice on privacy, has also called for a provision pre-empting state-level laws. In a memo for policymakers released last month, the group said the new federal bill should \u201cpreempt a patchwork of inconsistent state laws.\u201d Similarly, another group, the Technology Policy Institute, has asked that a federal privacy law pre-empts state regulation and explicitly called for any new national standard to have \u201cfewer restrictions on the use of information.\u201d\nBoth groups receive funding from Amazon, Google, and Facebook \u2014 and both strongly defended their positions.\nMarkus Heyder, a vice president at the Center for Information Policy Leadership, told The Intercept in an email, \u201cCIPL\u2019s mission is not to advocate specific industry positions, but to help develop globally consistent policies and approaches to privacy regulation that maximize both the appropriate protection of consumers from privacy risks and harms and reasonable data use and innovation.\u201d\nDavid Fish, a spokesperson for the Technology Policy Institute, dismissed concerns about industry funding, noting that his group\u2019s position is \u201cnot supported universally by industry.\u201d\nJust like NetChoice, the tech industry lobby group, the Center for Information Policy Leadership and the Center for Democracy and Technology have both called for a weak enforcement standard that rests largely with the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe push for pre-emption, however, is not shared by all privacy and consumer think tanks. Electronic Privacy Information Center, Public Citizen, and U.S. Public Interest Research Group are among several major advocacy organizations that have demanded that any federal standard not pre-empt state privacy law. \u201cFederal privacy legislation that preempts stronger state laws would only benefit technology companies at the expense of the public,\u201d the groups wrote in a letter to lawmakers.\nJeff Chester\u2019s group, the Center for Digital Democracy, also signed the letter demanding a redline on pre-emption. None of the four groups that signed the letter take corporate money.\nWait! Before you go on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn\u2019t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren\u2019t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don\u2019t have ads, so we depend on our members \u2014 35,000 and counting \u2014 to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn\u2019t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month. That\u2019s all it takes to support the journalism you rely on.",

Jones, who defeated Roy Moore in a wild 2017 special election, is considered the most vulnerable Senate Democrat up for re-election in 2020.\nInterestingly, Jones raised more money from the UK than he did from Alabama in the fourth quarter of last year, Yellowhammer News also reported last month.\n\u201cSenator Doug Jones (D-Ala.) might just have more support in Birmingham, England, than Birmingham, Alabama,\u201d the outlet quipped. \u201cAs first reported by Alabama Media Group, Jones raised more last reporting period from Americans overseas than from Alabamians.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact, he almost raked in more from people in the United Kingdom alone than Alabama.\u201d\nIn February, the senator\u2019s re-election committee apparently excluded Alabama votes from a Facebook ad that opposed President Trump\u2019s border declaration, according to the Washington Free Beacon.\n\u201cAs denoted by Facebook\u2019s ad archives, Jones\u2019s campaign was programmed to specifically target the news feeds of older individuals in Texas as well as the heavily liberal states of California, Massachusetts, and New York,\u201d the outlet reported. \u201c\u2026The divergent ads showcase the tightrope Jones has to walk between the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal base and his conservative state ahead of his 2020 reelection race.\u201d\nNorm Pattis joins Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson to give his take on the recent arrest of Julian Assange.\nBy the way, people who know what's coming are taking advantage of our healthy & delicious storable food!",

Then the school told her to remove it or else.https://t.co/olnzIPvrIu pic.twitter.com/3yI6BBLdmJ\n\u2014 UnionLeader.com (@UnionLeader) April 10, 2019\n.\u2066@EppingHighNH\u2069 freshman Ciretta MacKenzie says she was taken out of class on Monday and told that her \u2066@realDonaldTrump\u2069 T-shirt violated the dress code. #NBC10Boston #NECN pic.twitter.com/FzugxdTgEo\n\u2014 Mike Manzoni NBC10 Boston (@MikeNBCBoston) April 11, 2019\nOn Friday Principal Ernest issued an apology to MacKenzie, saying he had acted in error.\n\u201cWe have begun to draft a plan to move forward to promote civil discourse and diversity in our schools,\u201d Ernest stated. \u201cIn retrospect, I want to fully acknowledge my error in judgment and sincerely apologize if my actions were misinterpreted and offended anyone. That was never my intention.\u201d\nSchool district superintendent Valerie McKenny also issued a statement to the community saying the incident should never have happened.\n\u201cThe Epping School Board and Epping District\u2019s position is that this event should not ever have taken place, and we are committed to the creation of a school environment that promotes open and free thought and dialogue.\u201d\nMacKenzie\u2019s family is relieved and satisfied by the apology, according to CBS Boston.\nBy the way, people who know what's coming are taking advantage of our healthy & delicious storable food!",

That&rsquo;s driving this crisis, driving our resources, being overwhelmed.

It has to be bipartisan.

That\u2019s driving this crisis, driving our resources, being overwhelmed. We have to address it.\u201d the former Border Patrol chief urged.\nMorgan has previously expressed his support for a border wall, saying that \u201cThe president is right. The wall works.\u201d\nWhile senior Democrats and candidates for the Democratic nomination continue to suggest that there is no crisis on the border, Morgan isn\u2019t the only former Obama official sounding the alarm on the situation.\nObama\u2019s former head of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson has also repeatedly warned that the situation is \u201ca crisis by any measure.\u201d\n\u201cThis is, in my view, having owned this problem for three years, first, I know what a thousand a day looks like. I saw it myself at border patrol holding stations,\u201d Johnson said last week.\n\u201cI cannot begin to imagine what 4,000 a day looks like. It must overwhelm the system.\u201d he added.\n\u201cI think we have to get away from Democrat vs. Republican, crisis vs. no crisis.\u201d Johnson continued.\n\u201cThis is a crisis by any measure, and the solution inevitably is bipartisan. It has to be bipartisan. It requires a change in law,\u201d Johnson urged.\nBy the way, people who know what's coming are taking advantage of our healthy & delicious storable food!",

                "html": "<p><strong>Finally, the news that Vatican treasurer Cardinal George Pell has been found guilty of child sex abuse charges has been made public. Of course, the conviction of Pell, the Vatican treasurer and Opus Dei leader who became a close adviser to Pope Francis, will send shockwaves through the church, which is already reeling from accusations of sexual abuse committed by its pedophile rings worldwide.</strong></p>\n<p>To understand better why Pope Francis defrocked Theodore McCarrick and not the powerful Cardinal Pell, I include a brief extract from my latest book <em><strong>Confessions of an Illuminati Vol. 6.66</strong> </em>and the chapter appropriately entitled, <strong><em>Cardinal Pell: Satan&rsquo;s Little Helper </em></strong>:</p>\n<p>The Holy See is losing control of their fa&ccedil;ade, and the last glimpse of honor was lost with Cardinal Pell&rsquo;s arrival in Rome in 2014, after he was appointed by Pope Francis to be the first Cardinal-prefect of the newly created Secretariat for the Economy. In this new role, Pell was responsible for the annual budget of the Holy See and the Vatican, a position that needed an easily blackmailable figure, like him.</p>\n<p>No wonder the Vatican is now facing the biggest economic fall, partly due to the ill management of many of their businesses, but also because of the increasing compensation request from victims of pedophilia. This situation forced Pell back to his native Australia, where he even devised a scheme back in the 90s, called the <em>Melbourne Response</em>, for his Catholic priest pedophile network, so they could all pay the victims a ridiculous amount, and continue molesting them at a cheap price.</p>\n<p>At least one of them ended up suicidal due to the lack of support from the Church, and ABC news stated on the 29th of June 2017, that compensation for victims was capped at $50,000, and the process was widely criticised as offering inadequate support to victims. Strangely enough, when Pell arrived in Rome, <strong>Lord Christopher Patten (b.1944)</strong>, immediately joined his team. This is the same guy the elite of the New World Order used to cover-up the increasing pedophilia scandals in the <strong>BBC</strong>, that included the infamous activities of the pedophile monster <strong>Jimmy Savile</strong>. Patten, who was Governor of the BBC Trust from 2011 when he was nominated by the Queen until 2014, and then went on to work with Cardinal Pell. Just a coincidence? Of course not, the pedo ring that rules the world helps their own! However, for three years, the victims of Cardinal Pell, and a few journalists and writers including myself, in the Italian edition of <em>Pope Francis: The Last Pope?</em>, have openly warned the Pontiff and the Vatican about the dark side of the Australian prelate.</p>\n<p>Despite all this, Bergoglio appointed Cardinal Pell as his right arm for the economy, and a member of the elite group of nine, known as C9, the most influential Cardinals of the Church, now reduced to C6 after Pell and another two recently left. Despite evidence that Cardinal George Pell was covering-up for pedophilia in Australia and was possibly involved himself, the Pope went forward with placing him in one of the most important and influential positions in the Church today, where he lived a lavish lifestyle in Rome, often creating problems for Bergoglio&rsquo;s image, who refused all criticism towards him.</p>\n<p>After becoming an archbishop, Cardinal George Pell invited <strong>Opus Dei </strong>to establish themselves in Melbourne and then Sydney. Under Pell&rsquo;s patronage, <em>&ldquo;Opus Dei&rsquo;s star was on the rise, it is said, and that of others &mdash; including other more established groups within the Church &mdash; is sinking,</em>&rdquo; <strong>Sydney Morning Herald</strong>&rsquo;s religious affairs columnist wrote in January 2002. This reporter saw <em>&ldquo;signs of a new elitism&hellip;.a clerical culture is being encouraged in which there is a highly select &lsquo;in&rsquo; crowd around Pell.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Cardinal Pell maintained a close relationship with Australia&rsquo;s conservative PM, <strong>Tony Abbott</strong>, and his party for decades. Abbott served as the 28th Prime Minister of Australia from 2013 to 2015 and Leader of the Liberal Party from 2009 to 2015. He served as Leader of the Opposition from 2009 to 2013. Days before Pope Bergoglio appointed Pell on <strong>April 13, 2013</strong>, to his exclusive &ldquo;C8&rdquo; group of Cardinals (later C9), who would advise the pope on &ldquo;governing the Church,&rdquo; Pell attended a &ldquo;Gala Dinner&rdquo; celebrating the Melbourne-based <em>Institute of Public Affairs </em><strong>(IPA) </strong>an &ldquo;ultraconservative think tank.&rdquo; Illuminati media tycoon <strong>Rupert Murdoch </strong>was guest of honor and Abbott the keynote speaker in this event. (Murdoch was awarded a papal knighthood by Pope John Paul II for <strong>&ldquo;promoting the interests of society, the Church and the Holy See.&rdquo;</strong>) From Bergoglio&rsquo;s point of view, Pell had sound business experience at his arrival in Rome.</p>\n<p><strong> READ THE REST OF THE CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK:</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" src=\"https://assets.infowars.com/2019/02/Leo-Zagamy-Confessions-666-1-1-768x545.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.infowars.com/2019/02/Leo-Zagamy-Confessions-666-1-1-768x545.jpg 768w, https://assets.infowars.com/2019/02/Leo-Zagamy-Confessions-666-1-1-768x545-451x320.jpg 451w\"></img></figure>\n<p>Leo Zagami is a regular contributor to<strong> Infowars</strong> and the author of the new groundbreaking book <strong><em><u>Confessions of an Illuminati Vol. 6.66 The Age of Cyber Satan, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics</u></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>OUT NOW ON KINDLE:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Illuminati-6-66-Artificial-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B07NS8WS9V/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1550411820&sr=1-2&keywords=vol.+6.66\">https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Illuminati-6-66-Artificial-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B07NS8WS9V/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1550411820&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=vol.+6.66</a></p>\n<p><strong><em>And on paperback :</em></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1796904694/ref=cm_sw_r_fa_awdo_t1_2dvACb2HVH6TP?fbclid=IwAR1h_VlIytuACI3zxXUc9mBfOk96N4Yk0WH3To6Psv2kbFxJLwfzAwV4mUE\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1796904694/ref=cm_sw_r_fa_awdo_t1_2dvACb2HVH6TP?fbclid=IwAR1h_VlIytuACI3zxXUc9mBfOk96N4Yk0WH3To6Psv2kbFxJLwfzAwV4mUE</a></p>\n<p><em>This article first appeared at <a href=\"http://leozagami.com/2019/02/26/the-reasons-why-the-pope-has-not-defrocked-cardinal-pell/\">LeoZagami.com</a>.</em></p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://vod-api.infowars.com/embed/5c5c971b495b3c0017da8cc1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><strong>By the way, people who know what's coming are taking advantage of our <a href=\"https://www.infowarsstore.com/preparedness/emergency-survival-foods?ims=ccuef&utm_campaign=FSS-EmergencyFood-Jan20&utm_source=banned.video&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_content=FSS-EmergencyFood-J20BV\">healthy &amp; delicious storable food!</a></strong></p>",

                "text": "Finally, the news that Vatican treasurer Cardinal George Pell has been found guilty of child sex abuse charges has been made public. Of course, the conviction of Pell, the Vatican treasurer and Opus Dei leader who became a close adviser to Pope Francis, will send shockwaves through the church, which is already reeling from accusations of sexual abuse committed by its pedophile rings worldwide.\nTo understand better why Pope Francis defrocked Theodore McCarrick and not the powerful Cardinal Pell, I include a brief extract from my latest book Confessions of an Illuminati Vol. 6.66 and the chapter appropriately entitled, Cardinal Pell: Satan\u2019s Little Helper :\nThe Holy See is losing control of their fa\u00e7ade, and the last glimpse of honor was lost with Cardinal Pell\u2019s arrival in Rome in 2014, after he was appointed by Pope Francis to be the first Cardinal-prefect of the newly created Secretariat for the Economy. In this new role, Pell was responsible for the annual budget of the Holy See and the Vatican, a position that needed an easily blackmailable figure, like him.\nNo wonder the Vatican is now facing the biggest economic fall, partly due to the ill management of many of their businesses, but also because of the increasing compensation request from victims of pedophilia. This situation forced Pell back to his native Australia, where he even devised a scheme back in the 90s, called the Melbourne Response, for his Catholic priest pedophile network, so they could all pay the victims a ridiculous amount, and continue molesting them at a cheap price.\nAt least one of them ended up suicidal due to the lack of support from the Church, and ABC news stated on the 29th of June 2017, that compensation for victims was capped at $50,000, and the process was widely criticised as offering inadequate support to victims. Strangely enough, when Pell arrived in Rome, Lord Christopher Patten (b.1944), immediately joined his team. This is the same guy the elite of the New World Order used to cover-up the increasing pedophilia scandals in the BBC, that included the infamous activities of the pedophile monster Jimmy Savile. Patten, who was Governor of the BBC Trust from 2011 when he was nominated by the Queen until 2014, and then went on to work with Cardinal Pell. Just a coincidence? Of course not, the pedo ring that rules the world helps their own! However, for three years, the victims of Cardinal Pell, and a few journalists and writers including myself, in the Italian edition of Pope Francis: The Last Pope?, have openly warned the Pontiff and the Vatican about the dark side of the Australian prelate.\nDespite all this, Bergoglio appointed Cardinal Pell as his right arm for the economy, and a member of the elite group of nine, known as C9, the most influential Cardinals of the Church, now reduced to C6 after Pell and another two recently left. Despite evidence that Cardinal George Pell was covering-up for pedophilia in Australia and was possibly involved himself, the Pope went forward with placing him in one of the most important and influential positions in the Church today, where he lived a lavish lifestyle in Rome, often creating problems for Bergoglio\u2019s image, who refused all criticism towards him.\nAfter becoming an archbishop, Cardinal George Pell invited Opus Dei to establish themselves in Melbourne and then Sydney. Under Pell\u2019s patronage, \u201cOpus Dei\u2019s star was on the rise, it is said, and that of others \u2014 including other more established groups within the Church \u2014 is sinking,\u201d Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s religious affairs columnist wrote in January 2002. This reporter saw \u201csigns of a new elitism\u2026.a clerical culture is being encouraged in which there is a highly select \u2018in\u2019 crowd around Pell.\u201d\nCardinal Pell maintained a close relationship with Australia\u2019s conservative PM, Tony Abbott, and his party for decades. Abbott served as the 28th Prime Minister of Australia from 2013 to 2015 and Leader of the Liberal Party from 2009 to 2015. He served as Leader of the Opposition from 2009 to 2013. Days before Pope Bergoglio appointed Pell on April 13, 2013, to his exclusive \u201cC8\u201d group of Cardinals (later C9), who would advise the pope on \u201cgoverning the Church,\u201d Pell attended a \u201cGala Dinner\u201d celebrating the Melbourne-based Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) an \u201cultraconservative think tank.\u201d Illuminati media tycoon Rupert Murdoch was guest of honor and Abbott the keynote speaker in this event. (Murdoch was awarded a papal knighthood by Pope John Paul II for \u201cpromoting the interests of society, the Church and the Holy See.\u201d) From Bergoglio\u2019s point of view, Pell had sound business experience at his arrival in Rome.\nREAD THE REST OF THE CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK:\nLeo Zagami is a regular contributor to Infowars and the author of the new groundbreaking book Confessions of an Illuminati Vol. 6.66 The Age of Cyber Satan, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics\nOUT NOW ON KINDLE:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Illuminati-6-66-Artificial-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B07NS8WS9V/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1550411820&sr=1-2&keywords=vol.+6.66\nAnd on paperback :\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/1796904694/ref=cm_sw_r_fa_awdo_t1_2dvACb2HVH6TP?fbclid=IwAR1h_VlIytuACI3zxXUc9mBfOk96N4Yk0WH3To6Psv2kbFxJLwfzAwV4mUE\nThis article first appeared at LeoZagami.com.\nBy the way, people who know what's coming are taking advantage of our healthy & delicious storable food!",

Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez / Twitter</p> </figcaption></figure>\n<p>The only thing certain about today&rsquo;s municipal elections in Chicago is that it will settle little to nothing. From the mayoral race to a score of aldermanic elections, few if any of the most contentious races will have an outright winner; they&rsquo;ll be settled in an April runoff.</p>\n<p>But today&rsquo;s election is the <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/features/chicago_mayor_aldermanic_elections_political_revolution_social_movements.html\">most important</a> Chicago has seen in a generation, with an opportunity to make significant progress in breaking from the neoliberal status quo that has dominated the city&rsquo;s politics in recent years. Chicago&rsquo;s 2019 municipal elections are a microcosm of our national politics. The political class is scrambling to cope with a population that is furious about inequality, manifesting everywhere in daily life from commuting to work to paying the rent, but also desperate to continue doing nothing about it.</p>\n<p>The latest battle for Chicago began last September when Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced he was not running for a third term. After a mad scramble of <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-met-chicago-mayor-petition-deadline-20181126-story.html\">twenty-one</a> candidate vying to replace him, the final number of candidates on the ballot is <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/willie-wilson-petition-challenge-withdraw-mayoral-race-neal-sales-griffin-dorothy-brown/\">fourteen</a>. Yet despite the enormous number running, the differences between them range from slim to none.</p>\n<p>But in December, the Ed Burke corruption scandal broke. Burke, a fifty-year veteran of the city council, is at the center of the biggest corruption scandal in years &mdash; one that has threatened much of the city&rsquo;s political establishment.</p>\n<p>The scandal soiled the <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/toni-preckwinkle-susana-mendoza-favorites-face-off-mayoral-run-cfl-poll-shows/\">two leading candidates</a> at the time, <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/09/toni-preckwinkle-chicago-mayor-cook-county\">Toni Preckwinkle</a>, the chair of the Cook County Democratic Party and the current president of the Cook County Board, and Susana Mendoza, the Illinois comptroller, who both share <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/kass/ct-met-chicago-mayor-race-kass-20190116-story.html\">extensive ties</a> to Burke.</p>\n<p>Things took a bizarre turn in January, when it was revealed that longtime Chicago alderman Danny Solis was wiring a wire for nearly two years for the FBI, recording the most private of political conversations with local and state leaders of the Democratic Party, including Burke. Solis hasn&rsquo;t been seen in public since then.</p>\n<p>The Burke-Solis scandals have pulled back the mask of the corrupt relationship between the real-estate goliath gentrifying Chicago and the political class that serves it. This not small change political corruption but involves millions in various and sundry payoffs to remold what Chicago will look like for the next century.</p>\n<p>While the mayor&rsquo;s race comes to an inconclusive end &mdash; none of the leading candidates break <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-met-chicago-mayoral-race-final-push-20190222-story.html\">20 percent</a> in the most recent poll of likely voters, and a majority vote is required to win &mdash; the most important elections to keep an eye on are the aldermanic contests, where socialists are fighting for the largest number of seats on the city council in living memory.</p>\n<h1>Mayor 1% Collapses</h1>\n<p>What was so surprising about Mayor Emanuel&rsquo;s fall was that everything appeared to be going his way.</p>\n<p>His strongest and likely opponent, Jesus &ldquo;Chuy&rdquo; Garcia, who forced Rahm into a run-off in 2015, was anointed the successor to retiring US representative Luis Gutierrez. Gutierrez, a longtime Rahm ally and national advocate for immigrant rights, orchestrated Garcia&rsquo;s move into a safe congressional seat. With Garcia off to Washington, Rahm&rsquo;s reelection appeared secure.</p>\n<p>Rahm was also getting his signature projects passed with little opposition. In one week in late May 2018, he won two major votes on the city council for the <a href=\"https://abc7chicago.com/society/city-council-approves-obama-presidential-center-plans-/3511344/\">Obama Presidential Library</a> in Jackson Park and a new police academy, to be built to the tune of <a href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20170703/garfield-park/new-police-fire-academy-training-first-responder-department-mayor-rahm-emanuel/\">$95 million</a> on the West Side.</p>\n<p>In both cases, the city council voted 48-1 to approve both projects that would accelerate the rapid gentrification of working-class, black communities. The virtually unanimous vote demonstrated, once again, how much of a rubber stamp the city council was for Rahm. Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, was the sole dissenting vote on the cop academy.</p>\n<p>And Emanuel was sitting on a mountain of cash for a third run. By late July 2018, his campaign war chest had swelled to <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/its-fundraising-friday-again-rahm-emanuel-adds-another-600k-to-warchest/\">$8 million</a>, with the prospect of much more money coming his way. Few contenders could compete in the money race with him.</p>\n<p>Emanuel was already a legend in the Democratic Party for his fundraising abilities, but there was little secret to his success. If you didn&rsquo;t pay up, you didn&rsquo;t get access or contracts. Much of his contributions were from the city&rsquo;s hospitality and tourist businesses, which flourished under him, along with construction companies and investment companies.</p>\n<p>Everyone I knew expected him to run again and win (<a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/08/chicago-gun-violence-rahm-emanuel\">including me</a>). What happened? We may have to wait several years for a credible insider account of the decision-making that led to his withdrawal. But his pollsters must have warned him that his support was narrow and weak, and that the right sort of contender could defeat him. His own statements on withdrawing weren&rsquo;t <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/04/politics/chicago-mayor-rahm-emanuel-re-election/index.html\">credible</a>. The answer had to lay somewhere else.</p>\n<p>Rahm was never a popular mayor either politically or personally, despite winning two elections. His famously thuggish personality &mdash; which he confessed to in a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/rahm-emanuel-i-can-rub-people-the-wrong-way/2015/03/04/fc65ca6e-c275-11e4-a188-8e4971d37a8d_video.html?utm_term=.0d90c0bf09c0\">election commercial</a> &mdash; combined with his ruthless pursuit of a political agenda that made the ultra-rich richer led him to be tagged as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/459-mayor-1\">Mayor 1%</a>&rdquo; early in his administration.</p>\n<p>His failed effort during the last two years of his administration to lure Amazon to Chicago to build its new &ldquo;HQ2&rdquo; reinforced this image. He and former Illinois governor Bruce Rauner offered Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos over $2.2 billion in tax breaks and the choicest land in the city for his new headquarters.</p>\n<p>But it was the historic 2012 Chicago Teachers strike, led by the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), that permanently tarnished him as an opponent of progressive unions and community groups fighting educational apartheid. The strike and the CTU&rsquo;s continued role in city politics has elevated other working-class struggles in the city, from housing rights to fighting police racism.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Rev-Jesse-Jackson-Calls-for-March-on-Michigan-Avenue-on-Black-Friday-353942231.html\">CTU endorsed</a> a Black Friday 2015 protest march on Chicago&rsquo;s famed shopping district the &ldquo;Magnificent Mile&rdquo; &mdash; a magnet for tourists &mdash; in response to the city releasing the long-suppressed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/nov/24/chicago-officials-release-video-showing-police-killing-of-laquan-mcdonald-video\">dash cam video</a> of the murder of seventeen-year-old Laquan McDonald by Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke. CTU members even <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/18733/chicago-teachers-union-laquan-mcdonald-rahm-emanuel-anita-alvarez-resign\">voted to call on him to resign</a> in the wake of the scandal.</p>\n<p>McDonald was shot sixteen times by Van Dyke on October 20, 2014. The video was considered so politically explosive and detrimental to Rahm&rsquo;s reelection that his administration suppressed it. <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-laquan-mcdonald-emails-met-0101-20151231-story.html\">Emails</a> later released under court order revealed a panicked administration doing everything it could to keep it out of the public eye.</p>\n<p>The city even settled with the McDonald family for $5 million, even though they hadn&rsquo;t filed a lawsuit. Rahm&rsquo;s fears about the political impact of the video were confirmed in December 2015, when 51 percent of likely voters said they believed he should have <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/12/08/poll-51-chicagoans-say-mayor-rahm-emanuel-should-resign/76977622/\">resigned</a>, and 67 percent disapproved of his job performance for handling of the case.</p>\n<p>Despite the unified support that Rahm had from business and the city council, the prospect of seeking reelection to a third term was uncertain at best with the trial of Jason Van Dyke on the horizon. He chose to bow out rather than face defeat and humiliation.</p>\n<p>The contenders to replace Rahm are mostly old and familiar faces, overwhelmingly drawn from the existing political class in Chicago. They are career politicians, many of whom have worked for or are related to former Mayor Richard M. Daley, Rahm&rsquo;s predecessor, or Rahm himself. All, of course, are running as &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; or &ldquo;independents.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The top <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/chicago-mayor-election-2019-mayoral-money-tracker-candidates-campaign-fundraising-contributions-spending/\">fundraiser</a> so far is Bill Daley, the son and brother of two former mayors, the infamous <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DYX9MJU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1\">Richard J. Daley</a> (1955&ndash;1976), and his son Richard M. Daley, Rahm&rsquo;s immediate predecessor. Bill Daley rose to high-level positions by appointments and has the most extensive corporate connections. He was Bill Clinton&rsquo;s commerce secretary and Obama&rsquo;s chief of staff, a fact his extensive <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjZye4dbrwI\">television ads</a> play up.</p>\n<p>For those who thought that the Daley dynasty was done and another couldn&rsquo;t be elected mayor, Bill Daley &mdash; a former <a href=\"https://www.bondbuyer.com/news/chicago-public-finance-banker-bill-daley-jumps-to-goldman-sachs\">Goldman Sachs</a> executive &mdash; might prove them wrong. In such a large field of candidates drawing narrow support from likely voters, he could squeak by and land in the April runoff. We know from two recent <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/business/billionaire-ken-griffin-1-million-bill-daleys-campaign-mayor-billionaire/\">campaign contributions</a> of a million dollars each from Ken Griffin, a Republican and the richest man in Illinois, that Daley is the favorite of the billionaire hedge fund crowd.</p>\n<p>The rest of the pack are local and state political figures, businessmen, or products of the NGO milieu. Most are creatures of the Cook County Democratic Party, or what is referred to locally as the &ldquo;machine.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Paul Vallas is a <a href=\"http://www.substancenews.net/articles.php?page=5738\">union-buster</a> and privatizer of public schools who got his start as Mayor Richard M. Daley&rsquo;s CEO of Chicago Public Schools (CPS). Gery Chico was Daley&rsquo;s chief of staff and was later appointed by him to be school board president.</p>\n<p>Lori Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor, has held a variety jobs under the Daley and Rahm administrations. Her last position was president of the Chicago Police Board, the civilian body that oversees disciplinary cases for Chicago police officers.</p>\n<p>Garry McCarthy, the Chicago police chief fired by Rahm as part of his attempt to distance himself from the Laquan McDonald case, has tried to appeal to the largely white backlash voters, mostly cops and firemen, who are heavily concentrated in the residential neighborhoods on the Northwest and Southwest fringes of the city.</p>\n<p>Several precincts in these neighborhoods went for <a href=\"https://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/November-2016/Chicago-Election-Results-President/\">Trump in 2016</a>, and two precincts in the Mount Greenwood neighborhood on the Southwest Side actually gave the <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/nazi-art-jones-votes-19th-ward-southwest-side-mount-greenwood/\">Nazi Art Jones</a>, running on the Republican ballot line, nearly 40 percent of the vote in the November election for Congress.</p>\n<p>Jerry Joyce, a member of an old <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/jeremiah-joyce-jr-son-controverisal-daley-political-operative-plans-circulate-petitions-mayoral-race/\">political family</a>, is also courting the backlash vote, playing as the other law-and-order candidate.</p>\n<p>Amara Enyia is one of few candidates that could surprise political pundits. Her <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-met-chance-the-rapper-amara-enyia-chicago-mayor-20190115-story.html\">funding</a> largely comes from two Chicago rappers, Chance the Rapper and Kanye West &mdash; the latter of which is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/02/entertainment/kanye-west-trump-tweets/index.html\">Trump&rsquo;s best-known musician supporter</a>. This gives her an appeal, especially to younger people, but it conceals much.</p>\n<p>In response to Enyia&rsquo;s appeal for the Chicago Democratic Socialists of America&rsquo;s endorsement, Micah Uetricht wrote in <a href=\"http://www.midwestsocialist.com/2019/01/15/why-chicago-dsa-should-not-endorse-amara-enyia-for-mayor/\"><em>Midwest Socialist</em></a>, &ldquo;she actually <em>worked</em> in Daley&rsquo;s office as a policy analyst in 2009. Daley&rsquo;s tenure was fundamentally characterized by his embrace of <a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Daley-proposes-privatized-water-meters65754982.html\">widespread privatization</a>, <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/views/2009/05/29/arne-duncan-and-chicago-success-story-myth-or-reality\">attacks on public schools</a>, and a broadly <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/views/2009/05/29/arne-duncan-and-chicago-success-story-myth-or-reality\">neoliberal, anti-working class agenda</a>.&rdquo; She is a product of the consulting/NGO industrial complex that easily combines neoliberal policies with radical-sounding lingo.</p>\n<p>Until Bill Daley&rsquo;s improbable campaign pushed him towards the front of the pack, the two most likely candidates to replace Rahm were Cook County Board president <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/09/toni-preckwinkle-chicago-mayor-cook-county\">Toni Preckwinkle</a> and Illinois state comptroller Susana Mendoza. Both are career politicians.</p>\n<p>Preckwinkle, a former teacher and a twenty-year alderman from Hyde Park, the home of the University of Chicago, has been Cook County Board president since 2010. A liberal technocrat and former reformer, Preckwinkle has been part of the city&rsquo;s political establishment for a very long time. Preckwinkle had to return over $110,000 in campaign contributions from Burke. But while she has dumped Burke&rsquo;s money, her ties to developers go back a long way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chicagoreporter.com/will-toni-preckwinkles-woes-boost-susana-mendoza-in-mayoral-race/\">Curtis Black</a> recently wrote about Preckwinkle:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But back in her ward she relied heavily on campaign donations from developers. Search the archives of the Hyde Park Herald and you&rsquo;ll find repeated references to Preckwinkle &ldquo;com[ing] under fire for accepting donations from representatives of the development community currently at work in her ward.&rdquo; The notorious Tony Rezko, later convicted on corruption charges, was a major donor for many years.</p> <p>Preckwinkle isn&rsquo;t particularly well positioned to lead the charge for reform. In <a href=\"http://www.iviipo.org/2019_CandidateAnswers.htm\">her IVI-IPO questionnaire</a>, she declined to support a ban on political contributions from city contractors, parties seeking permits or zoning changes, or lobbyists. She said she supports public financing of political campaigns &mdash; the best option currently out there for cleaning up &ldquo;pay-to-play&rdquo; politics &mdash; &ldquo;in theory&rdquo; but not as a priority.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Susana Mendoza, the Illinois state comptroller, has tried to cast herself as a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lBR7ocwbs8\">feminist hero</a> and someone who understands the <a href=\"https://susanamendoza.com/futurenow/\">street violence</a> in Chicago&rsquo;s poor neighborhoods. Mendoza is a product of Mike Madigan&rsquo;s political machine. He is the longest-serving speaker of the Illinois House and rules over the state Democrats with an iron fist.</p>\n<p>Preckwinkle and Mendoza <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/toni-preckwinkle-susana-mendoza-favorites-face-off-mayoral-run-cfl-poll-shows/\">initially polled well</a>, but both have been severely tarnished by the Burke corruption scandal. Burke had a federal criminal complaint filed against him for <a href=\"https://news.wttw.com/2019/01/03/ald-ed-burke-charged-attempted-extortion\">extortion</a> in early January. Until recently, Burke was spoken of reverentially as the &ldquo;dean&rdquo; of the city council, a mentor or a role model. Ironically, he was.</p>\n<p>Most of Burke&rsquo;s extortion charge is related to denying permits to a company if they didn&rsquo;t give his tax law firm their business. Not only is this common practice for aldermen in Chicago, for whom being an alderman is a &ldquo;part-time job&rdquo; paying over $<a href=\"https://www.illinoispolicy.org/15-former-chicago-aldermen-collecting-6-figure-pensions/\">100,000, with a lucrative pension</a>. His wife is also an Illinois Supreme Court justice.</p>\n<p>Incredibly, Burke was <a href=\"https://wgntv.com/2016/02/17/donald-trumps-multi-million-dollar-chicago-tax-break/\">Donald Trump&rsquo;s tax lawyer for years</a> and saved Trump millions of dollars at the same time that working-class homeowners&rsquo; taxes have skyrocketed. Mendoza also received large contributions from Burke and was actually married at Burke&rsquo;s home.</p>\n<p>Despite the pretense of being a progressive and wanting to break up the &ldquo;old boys club,&rdquo; Preckwinkle has been revealed to be deeply part of it. She was initially <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/chicago-mayoral-election-susana-mendoza-toni-preckwinkle-poll/\">hurt far more than Mendoza</a> by her past association with Burke. But over the last few weeks that has shifted, and Mendoza has struggled to stay in a position to be in the runoff.</p>\n<p>No matter who ends up winning, Chicago&rsquo;s new mayor is unlikely to differ significantly from past practice. Preckwinkle stands out if for no other reason than the fact that she has won the support of the CTU. But she also has her own history of instituting austerity in and around Chicago. The other candidates would likely do the same in office, with some at least taking progressive stands on social issues while others hewing a more out-and-out reactionary line.</p>\n<p>The Burke-Solis corruption scandals have revealed the political-real-estate-financial complex that is at the heart of the rapid gentrification of Chicago. Working-class Chicago is disappearing from the city under the crushing weight of neoliberalism.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Chicago is one of the last major cities that you could possibly call <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/features/chicago_mayor_aldermanic_elections_political_revolution_social_movements.html\">working class</a>,&rdquo; Amisha Patel of the Grassroots Collaborative told <em>In These Times</em>. &ldquo;And that label is certainly disintegrating quickly as prices are escalating across neighborhoods, from Woodlawn to Logan Square.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Rahm is using his final months in office to push through mega-development projects such as Lincoln Yards, where a billion dollars in tax money will subsidize a mega-real-estate development that will not simply change the Chicago skyline but massively accelerate gentrification on the city&rsquo;s North Side.</p>\n<p>Taking on the real-estate developers and the political class that serves it will determine much of the future of working-class Chicago, and is at the heart of socialist challenges in key aldermanic races, especially in wards targeted for gentrification. Currently, one DSA member, Ramirez-Rosa, sits on the city council. If he is joined by one or two others, it will be the largest socialist presence at City Hall in one hundred years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/02/byron-sigcho-lopez-chicago-democratic-socialists-america-pilsen\">Byron Sigcho Lopez</a> is running to replace the disgraced Solis in the Twenty-Fifth Ward. The heart of the ward is Pilsen, a community ravaged by gentrification. Over <a href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160413/pilsen/pilsen-gets-whiter-as-10000-hispanics-families-move-out-study-finds/\">ten thousand Latinos</a> from the historically Mexican-American community have left since 2000. The Eighteenth Street retail district that runs through the heart of Pilsen is unrecognizable from a few years ago, now dotted with expensive shops and restaurants with valet parking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/09/carlos-rosa-chicago-bds-democratic-party\">Ramirez-Rosa</a>, a nationally known DSA member, is running for reelection in the Thirty-Fifth Ward. The heart of the ward is Logan Square, where &ldquo;between 2000 and 2014, about <a href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160516/logan-square/logan-squares-hispanic-population-dropped-by-19000-since-2000/\">19,200 Hispanic residents</a> moved out, a 35.6 percent decrease.&rdquo; Four years ago, Rosa defeated then-alderman <a href=\"https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/12/30/can-a-26-year-old-beat-rey-colon-in-the-35th-ward\">Rey Colon</a>, a frontman for the Logan Square real-estate mogul Mark Fishman, who was <a href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/01/04/mark-fishman-kicked-me-out-of-my-ward-office-ald-carlos-ramirez-rosa-says/\">recently described</a> as &ldquo;the face of gentrification in the neighborhood.&rdquo; Fishman is <a href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/01/28/meet-the-candidate-vying-for-ald-carlos-ramirez-rosas-35th-ward-seat/\">supporting</a> Ramirez-Rosa&rsquo;s opponent in this election, Amanda Yu Dieterich, but few believe she has a chance at defeating him.</p>\n<p>In the Thirty-Third Ward, another DSA member, <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/10/rossana-rodriguez-sanchez-chicago-city-council\">Rosanna Rodriguez-Sanchez</a>, is challenging Alderman Deb Mell, of the infamous <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2013-07-03-chi-ald-mell-retiring-after-nearly-4-decades-in-office-20130703-story.html\">Mell political dynasty</a>. Her brother-in-law is former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who is serving a fourteen-year prison sentence for public corruption. The heart of the Thirty-Third Ward is Albany Park, one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in the city and whose long-term residents are facing <a href=\"https://wgntv.com/2018/07/28/low-income-residents-say-theyre-being-squeezed-out-of-albany-park/\">mass evictions</a> as the neighborhood gentrifies. Like Yu Dieterich&rsquo;s, Deb Mell&rsquo;s campaign is heavily financed by <a href=\"https://www.debmell.money/?fbclid=IwAR33vjQjKAEMDMZLxvzOYYYQwOzSTyvIP-gudcXiyr6v6bGFd91tRE_OAXQ\">real-estate developers</a>. Like Rosa&rsquo;s, Rodriguez-Sanchez&rsquo;s campaign has widespread support from progressive unions, community groups, and socialists.</p>\n<p>In the Fortieth Ward, DSA members <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/02/ugo-okere-interview-alderman-chicago-city-council\">Ugo Okere</a> (who is endorsed by DSA) and Andre Vasquez are challenging incumbent Alderman Pat O&rsquo;Connor, Rahm&rsquo;s floor leader on the city council. O&rsquo;Connor has now been appointed to replace Ed Burke as chair of the city council&rsquo;s finance committee, making him one of the most powerful politicians in Chicago. Historian Rick Perlstein, who moderated the first aldermanic debate in the Fortieth Ward, called O&rsquo;Connor &ldquo;<a href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2018/10/17/ald-pat-oconnor-called-racist-troll-by-moderator-of-40th-ward-forum/\">a racist troll</a>&rdquo; on Facebook after he made blatantly bigoted comments about Okere&rsquo;s Nigerian heritage. Perhaps unsurprisingly, O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s wife Barbara is <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2008-06-01-0806010003-story.html\">a major player</a> in real estate.</p>\n<p>In the Twentieth Ward, where Toni Preckwinkle was alderman for two decades, DSA-endorsed candidate Jeanette Taylor, a mother of five and former <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/10/chicago-teachers-union-rahm-emanuel-school-closures/\">Dyett High School hunger striker</a>, is running against eight other candidates for alderman. In a recent <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/02/jeanette-taylor-koco-chicago-schools-20th-ward\">interview</a> in <em>Jacobin</em>, she said, referring to the Obama presidential library pushed hard by Emanuel:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The ward as a whole is in jeopardy from the Obama library. All of a sudden, parts of the ward are getting clean, there are lights, they&rsquo;re making it pretty. That&rsquo;s not for us. That&rsquo;s for selling it. They&rsquo;re going to say you&rsquo;re fifteen minutes away from the Obama center. Move in. The entire ward will be a victim of this placement if we don&rsquo;t get an elected official who is willing to stand up and fight for this community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, DSA member Pete DeMay is making his second attempt to unseat Twelfth Ward alderman George Cardenas, a major ally of Rahm. Cardenas recently received a $20,000 campaign donation from Rahm&rsquo;s super PAC.</p>\n<p>Beyond the DSA is another layer of challengers to the status quo politicians endorsed by the <a href=\"https://www.unitedworkingfamilies.org/endorsements\">United Working Families of Illinois</a>, including Erika Wozniak Francis, a CTU delegate running in the Forty-Sixth Ward and Maria Hadden in the Forty-Ninth.</p>\n<p>The next mayor of Chicago will likely continue the four-decades-long project to gentrify the city. Yet there is also the potential to create an organized socialist presence on the city council that can mobilize opposition to that project in a way that the current Progressive Caucus has failed to do.</p>\n<p>We are the tipping point for the class and racial makeup of the major cities of the United States. This may be Chicago&rsquo;s last chance to stay a working-class city for working-class people. Gentrification is moving at rapid speed. Much of the city has been privatized.</p>\n<p>Chicago desperately needs a political bloc that opposes neoliberalism in the city. The next mayor of Chicago probably won&rsquo;t be part of that bloc, but Chicagoans could take steps towards building it in the city council today.</p>",

                "text": "The only thing certain about today\u2019s municipal elections in Chicago is that it will settle little to nothing. From the mayoral race to a score of aldermanic elections, few if any of the most contentious races will have an outright winner; they\u2019ll be settled in an April runoff.\nBut today\u2019s election is the most important Chicago has seen in a generation, with an opportunity to make significant progress in breaking from the neoliberal status quo that has dominated the city\u2019s politics in recent years. Chicago\u2019s 2019 municipal elections are a microcosm of our national politics. The political class is scrambling to cope with a population that is furious about inequality, manifesting everywhere in daily life from commuting to work to paying the rent, but also desperate to continue doing nothing about it.\nThe latest battle for Chicago began last September when Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced he was not running for a third term. After a mad scramble of twenty-one candidate vying to replace him, the final number of candidates on the ballot is fourteen. Yet despite the enormous number running, the differences between them range from slim to none.\nBut in December, the Ed Burke corruption scandal broke. Burke, a fifty-year veteran of the city council, is at the center of the biggest corruption scandal in years \u2014 one that has threatened much of the city\u2019s political establishment.\nThe scandal soiled the two leading candidates at the time, Toni Preckwinkle, the chair of the Cook County Democratic Party and the current president of the Cook County Board, and Susana Mendoza, the Illinois comptroller, who both share extensive ties to Burke.\nThings took a bizarre turn in January, when it was revealed that longtime Chicago alderman Danny Solis was wiring a wire for nearly two years for the FBI, recording the most private of political conversations with local and state leaders of the Democratic Party, including Burke. Solis hasn\u2019t been seen in public since then.\nThe Burke-Solis scandals have pulled back the mask of the corrupt relationship between the real-estate goliath gentrifying Chicago and the political class that serves it. This not small change political corruption but involves millions in various and sundry payoffs to remold what Chicago will look like for the next century.\nWhile the mayor\u2019s race comes to an inconclusive end \u2014 none of the leading candidates break 20 percent in the most recent poll of likely voters, and a majority vote is required to win \u2014 the most important elections to keep an eye on are the aldermanic contests, where socialists are fighting for the largest number of seats on the city council in living memory.\nMayor 1% Collapses\nWhat was so surprising about Mayor Emanuel\u2019s fall was that everything appeared to be going his way.\nHis strongest and likely opponent, Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who forced Rahm into a run-off in 2015, was anointed the successor to retiring US representative Luis Gutierrez. Gutierrez, a longtime Rahm ally and national advocate for immigrant rights, orchestrated Garcia\u2019s move into a safe congressional seat. With Garcia off to Washington, Rahm\u2019s reelection appeared secure.\nRahm was also getting his signature projects passed with little opposition. In one week in late May 2018, he won two major votes on the city council for the Obama Presidential Library in Jackson Park and a new police academy, to be built to the tune of $95 million on the West Side.\nIn both cases, the city council voted 48-1 to approve both projects that would accelerate the rapid gentrification of working-class, black communities. The virtually unanimous vote demonstrated, once again, how much of a rubber stamp the city council was for Rahm. Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, was the sole dissenting vote on the cop academy.\nAnd Emanuel was sitting on a mountain of cash for a third run. By late July 2018, his campaign war chest had swelled to $8 million, with the prospect of much more money coming his way. Few contenders could compete in the money race with him.\nEmanuel was already a legend in the Democratic Party for his fundraising abilities, but there was little secret to his success. If you didn\u2019t pay up, you didn\u2019t get access or contracts. Much of his contributions were from the city\u2019s hospitality and tourist businesses, which flourished under him, along with construction companies and investment companies.\nEveryone I knew expected him to run again and win (including me). What happened? We may have to wait several years for a credible insider account of the decision-making that led to his withdrawal. But his pollsters must have warned him that his support was narrow and weak, and that the right sort of contender could defeat him. His own statements on withdrawing weren\u2019t credible. The answer had to lay somewhere else.\nRahm was never a popular mayor either politically or personally, despite winning two elections. His famously thuggish personality \u2014 which he confessed to in a 2015 election commercial \u2014 combined with his ruthless pursuit of a political agenda that made the ultra-rich richer led him to be tagged as \u201cMayor 1%\u201d early in his administration.\nHis failed effort during the last two years of his administration to lure Amazon to Chicago to build its new \u201cHQ2\u201d reinforced this image. He and former Illinois governor Bruce Rauner offered Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos over $2.2 billion in tax breaks and the choicest land in the city for his new headquarters.\nBut it was the historic 2012 Chicago Teachers strike, led by the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), that permanently tarnished him as an opponent of progressive unions and community groups fighting educational apartheid. The strike and the CTU\u2019s continued role in city politics has elevated other working-class struggles in the city, from housing rights to fighting police racism.\nThe CTU endorsed a Black Friday 2015 protest march on Chicago\u2019s famed shopping district the \u201cMagnificent Mile\u201d \u2014 a magnet for tourists \u2014 in response to the city releasing the long-suppressed dash cam video of the murder of seventeen-year-old Laquan McDonald by Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke. CTU members even voted to call on him to resign in the wake of the scandal.\nMcDonald was shot sixteen times by Van Dyke on October 20, 2014. The video was considered so politically explosive and detrimental to Rahm\u2019s reelection that his administration suppressed it. Emails later released under court order revealed a panicked administration doing everything it could to keep it out of the public eye.\nThe city even settled with the McDonald family for $5 million, even though they hadn\u2019t filed a lawsuit. Rahm\u2019s fears about the political impact of the video were confirmed in December 2015, when 51 percent of likely voters said they believed he should have resigned, and 67 percent disapproved of his job performance for handling of the case.\nDespite the unified support that Rahm had from business and the city council, the prospect of seeking reelection to a third term was uncertain at best with the trial of Jason Van Dyke on the horizon. He chose to bow out rather than face defeat and humiliation.\nThe contenders to replace Rahm are mostly old and familiar faces, overwhelmingly drawn from the existing political class in Chicago. They are career politicians, many of whom have worked for or are related to former Mayor Richard M. Daley, Rahm\u2019s predecessor, or Rahm himself. All, of course, are running as \u201coutsiders\u201d or \u201cindependents.\u201d\nThe top fundraiser so far is Bill Daley, the son and brother of two former mayors, the infamous Richard J. Daley (1955\u20131976), and his son Richard M. Daley, Rahm\u2019s immediate predecessor. Bill Daley rose to high-level positions by appointments and has the most extensive corporate connections. He was Bill Clinton\u2019s commerce secretary and Obama\u2019s chief of staff, a fact his extensive television ads play up.\nFor those who thought that the Daley dynasty was done and another couldn\u2019t be elected mayor, Bill Daley \u2014 a former Goldman Sachs executive \u2014 might prove them wrong. In such a large field of candidates drawing narrow support from likely voters, he could squeak by and land in the April runoff. We know from two recent campaign contributions of a million dollars each from Ken Griffin, a Republican and the richest man in Illinois, that Daley is the favorite of the billionaire hedge fund crowd.\nThe rest of the pack are local and state political figures, businessmen, or products of the NGO milieu. Most are creatures of the Cook County Democratic Party, or what is referred to locally as the \u201cmachine.\u201d\nPaul Vallas is a union-buster and privatizer of public schools who got his start as Mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s CEO of Chicago Public Schools (CPS). Gery Chico was Daley\u2019s chief of staff and was later appointed by him to be school board president.\nLori Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor, has held a variety jobs under the Daley and Rahm administrations. Her last position was president of the Chicago Police Board, the civilian body that oversees disciplinary cases for Chicago police officers.\nGarry McCarthy, the Chicago police chief fired by Rahm as part of his attempt to distance himself from the Laquan McDonald case, has tried to appeal to the largely white backlash voters, mostly cops and firemen, who are heavily concentrated in the residential neighborhoods on the Northwest and Southwest fringes of the city.\nSeveral precincts in these neighborhoods went for Trump in 2016, and two precincts in the Mount Greenwood neighborhood on the Southwest Side actually gave the Nazi Art Jones, running on the Republican ballot line, nearly 40 percent of the vote in the November election for Congress.\nJerry Joyce, a member of an old political family, is also courting the backlash vote, playing as the other law-and-order candidate.\nAmara Enyia is one of few candidates that could surprise political pundits. Her funding largely comes from two Chicago rappers, Chance the Rapper and Kanye West \u2014 the latter of which is Trump\u2019s best-known musician supporter. This gives her an appeal, especially to younger people, but it conceals much.\nIn response to Enyia\u2019s appeal for the Chicago Democratic Socialists of America\u2019s endorsement, Micah Uetricht wrote in Midwest Socialist, \u201cshe actually worked in Daley\u2019s office as a policy analyst in 2009. Daley\u2019s tenure was fundamentally characterized by his embrace of widespread privatization, attacks on public schools, and a broadly neoliberal, anti-working class agenda.\u201d She is a product of the consulting/NGO industrial complex that easily combines neoliberal policies with radical-sounding lingo.\nUntil Bill Daley\u2019s improbable campaign pushed him towards the front of the pack, the two most likely candidates to replace Rahm were Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle and Illinois state comptroller Susana Mendoza. Both are career politicians.\nPreckwinkle, a former teacher and a twenty-year alderman from Hyde Park, the home of the University of Chicago, has been Cook County Board president since 2010. A liberal technocrat and former reformer, Preckwinkle has been part of the city\u2019s political establishment for a very long time. Preckwinkle had to return over $110,000 in campaign contributions from Burke. But while she has dumped Burke\u2019s money, her ties to developers go back a long way.\nCurtis Black recently wrote about Preckwinkle:\nBut back in her ward she relied heavily on campaign donations from developers. Search the archives of the Hyde Park Herald and you\u2019ll find repeated references to Preckwinkle \u201ccom[ing] under fire for accepting donations from representatives of the development community currently at work in her ward.\u201d The notorious Tony Rezko, later convicted on corruption charges, was a major donor for many years.\nPreckwinkle isn\u2019t particularly well positioned to lead the charge for reform. In her IVI-IPO questionnaire, she declined to support a ban on political contributions from city contractors, parties seeking permits or zoning changes, or lobbyists. She said she supports public financing of political campaigns \u2014 the best option currently out there for cleaning up \u201cpay-to-play\u201d politics \u2014 \u201cin theory\u201d but not as a priority.\nSusana Mendoza, the Illinois state comptroller, has tried to cast herself as a feminist hero and someone who understands the street violence in Chicago\u2019s poor neighborhoods. Mendoza is a product of Mike Madigan\u2019s political machine. He is the longest-serving speaker of the Illinois House and rules over the state Democrats with an iron fist.\nPreckwinkle and Mendoza initially polled well, but both have been severely tarnished by the Burke corruption scandal. Burke had a federal criminal complaint filed against him for extortion in early January. Until recently, Burke was spoken of reverentially as the \u201cdean\u201d of the city council, a mentor or a role model. Ironically, he was.\nMost of Burke\u2019s extortion charge is related to denying permits to a company if they didn\u2019t give his tax law firm their business. Not only is this common practice for aldermen in Chicago, for whom being an alderman is a \u201cpart-time job\u201d paying over $100,000, with a lucrative pension. His wife is also an Illinois Supreme Court justice.\nIncredibly, Burke was Donald Trump\u2019s tax lawyer for years and saved Trump millions of dollars at the same time that working-class homeowners\u2019 taxes have skyrocketed. Mendoza also received large contributions from Burke and was actually married at Burke\u2019s home.\nDespite the pretense of being a progressive and wanting to break up the \u201cold boys club,\u201d Preckwinkle has been revealed to be deeply part of it. She was initially hurt far more than Mendoza by her past association with Burke. But over the last few weeks that has shifted, and Mendoza has struggled to stay in a position to be in the runoff.\nNo matter who ends up winning, Chicago\u2019s new mayor is unlikely to differ significantly from past practice. Preckwinkle stands out if for no other reason than the fact that she has won the support of the CTU. But she also has her own history of instituting austerity in and around Chicago. The other candidates would likely do the same in office, with some at least taking progressive stands on social issues while others hewing a more out-and-out reactionary line.\nThe Burke-Solis corruption scandals have revealed the political-real-estate-financial complex that is at the heart of the rapid gentrification of Chicago. Working-class Chicago is disappearing from the city under the crushing weight of neoliberalism.\n\u201cChicago is one of the last major cities that you could possibly call working class,\u201d Amisha Patel of the Grassroots Collaborative told In These Times. \u201cAnd that label is certainly disintegrating quickly as prices are escalating across neighborhoods, from Woodlawn to Logan Square.\u201d\nRahm is using his final months in office to push through mega-development projects such as Lincoln Yards, where a billion dollars in tax money will subsidize a mega-real-estate development that will not simply change the Chicago skyline but massively accelerate gentrification on the city\u2019s North Side.\nTaking on the real-estate developers and the political class that serves it will determine much of the future of working-class Chicago, and is at the heart of socialist challenges in key aldermanic races, especially in wards targeted for gentrification. Currently, one DSA member, Ramirez-Rosa, sits on the city council. If he is joined by one or two others, it will be the largest socialist presence at City Hall in one hundred years.\nByron Sigcho Lopez is running to replace the disgraced Solis in the Twenty-Fifth Ward. The heart of the ward is Pilsen, a community ravaged by gentrification. Over ten thousand Latinos from the historically Mexican-American community have left since 2000. The Eighteenth Street retail district that runs through the heart of Pilsen is unrecognizable from a few years ago, now dotted with expensive shops and restaurants with valet parking.\nRamirez-Rosa, a nationally known DSA member, is running for reelection in the Thirty-Fifth Ward. The heart of the ward is Logan Square, where \u201cbetween 2000 and 2014, about 19,200 Hispanic residents moved out, a 35.6 percent decrease.\u201d Four years ago, Rosa defeated then-alderman Rey Colon, a frontman for the Logan Square real-estate mogul Mark Fishman, who was recently described as \u201cthe face of gentrification in the neighborhood.\u201d Fishman is supporting Ramirez-Rosa\u2019s opponent in this election, Amanda Yu Dieterich, but few believe she has a chance at defeating him.\nIn the Thirty-Third Ward, another DSA member, Rosanna Rodriguez-Sanchez, is challenging Alderman Deb Mell, of the infamous Mell political dynasty. Her brother-in-law is former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who is serving a fourteen-year prison sentence for public corruption. The heart of the Thirty-Third Ward is Albany Park, one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in the city and whose long-term residents are facing mass evictions as the neighborhood gentrifies. Like Yu Dieterich\u2019s, Deb Mell\u2019s campaign is heavily financed by real-estate developers. Like Rosa\u2019s, Rodriguez-Sanchez\u2019s campaign has widespread support from progressive unions, community groups, and socialists.\nIn the Fortieth Ward, DSA members Ugo Okere (who is endorsed by DSA) and Andre Vasquez are challenging incumbent Alderman Pat O\u2019Connor, Rahm\u2019s floor leader on the city council. O\u2019Connor has now been appointed to replace Ed Burke as chair of the city council\u2019s finance committee, making him one of the most powerful politicians in Chicago. Historian Rick Perlstein, who moderated the first aldermanic debate in the Fortieth Ward, called O\u2019Connor \u201ca racist troll\u201d on Facebook after he made blatantly bigoted comments about Okere\u2019s Nigerian heritage. Perhaps unsurprisingly, O\u2019Connor\u2019s wife Barbara is a major player in real estate.\nIn the Twentieth Ward, where Toni Preckwinkle was alderman for two decades, DSA-endorsed candidate Jeanette Taylor, a mother of five and former Dyett High School hunger striker, is running against eight other candidates for alderman. In a recent interview in Jacobin, she said, referring to the Obama presidential library pushed hard by Emanuel:\nThe ward as a whole is in jeopardy from the Obama library. All of a sudden, parts of the ward are getting clean, there are lights, they\u2019re making it pretty. That\u2019s not for us. That\u2019s for selling it. They\u2019re going to say you\u2019re fifteen minutes away from the Obama center. Move in. The entire ward will be a victim of this placement if we don\u2019t get an elected official who is willing to stand up and fight for this community.\nMeanwhile, DSA member Pete DeMay is making his second attempt to unseat Twelfth Ward alderman George Cardenas, a major ally of Rahm. Cardenas recently received a $20,000 campaign donation from Rahm\u2019s super PAC.\nBeyond the DSA is another layer of challengers to the status quo politicians endorsed by the United Working Families of Illinois, including Erika Wozniak Francis, a CTU delegate running in the Forty-Sixth Ward and Maria Hadden in the Forty-Ninth.\nThe next mayor of Chicago will likely continue the four-decades-long project to gentrify the city. Yet there is also the potential to create an organized socialist presence on the city council that can mobilize opposition to that project in a way that the current Progressive Caucus has failed to do.\nWe are the tipping point for the class and racial makeup of the major cities of the United States. This may be Chicago\u2019s last chance to stay a working-class city for working-class people. Gentrification is moving at rapid speed. Much of the city has been privatized.\nChicago desperately needs a political bloc that opposes neoliberalism in the city. The next mayor of Chicago probably won\u2019t be part of that bloc, but Chicagoans could take steps towards building it in the city council today.",

The basic idea is to charge parents a fee equal to 0 to 7 percent of their income to attend various local childcare options with the federal government making up the rest of the cost of that care via grants. I told the <em>Washington Post</em>&rsquo;s Jeff Stein that I thought it was a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/02/19/sen-elizabeth-warren-proposes-universal-child-care-paid-by-tax-ultra-millionaires/\">good start</a>. Below are four other notes on it based on the way I <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/projects/family-fun-pack/\">think</a> about this issue.</p>\n<h1>1</h1>\n<p>In my Family Fun Pack <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/projects/family-fun-pack/\">program</a>, parents are given the option of sending their kids to a free public childcare center or receiving a home childcare allowance if they prefer to care for young kids in the home. Warren&rsquo;s plan currently does not offer support to stay-at-home carers, though her 2006 book <em>The Two-Income Trap </em>acknowledges that such support has to be part of a childcare benefit system.</p>\n<p>Home childcare allowances, which provide cash to at-home carers, make a childcare benefit system equitable to all kinds of families and are especially important to rural people and immigrants, who disproportionately do childcare in the home.</p>\n<h1>2</h1>\n<p>Nominal fees are not uncommon for childcare programs in the world, but I genuinely do not understand why they are being charged at all.</p>\n<p>In the context of health care, the theory behind charging fees &mdash; deductibles, <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2017/10/sanders-single-payer-copays-medicare-for-all\">co-pays</a>, coinsurance &mdash; to users is to discourage people from going to the doctor all the time. But this reasoning does not make sense in the context of childcare where we want people to utilize it and where it is not really possible to overutilize it in the same way that it is possible to overutilize health care.</p>\n<p>One goal of charging the fees might be to raise revenue to fund the childcare system, but in that case it seems like you should use broad-based taxes that apply to all households not de facto 0 to 7 percent taxes applied only to households with children in childcare. It would be trivial to raise that amount of revenue from the universe of all households and would seemingly make the program more popular and fairer.</p>\n<h1>3</h1>\n<p>As currently written, Warren&rsquo;s proposal does not appear to contain any mechanism for controlling the underlying costs of the childcare itself. It promises to cap user fees at 0 to 7 percent of income, but then appears to offer open-ended subsidies for the remaining charges of each childcare center. Unless the plan also specifically caps how much childcare centers can charge the government, there is nothing to prevent childcare centers from escalating costs at will.</p>\n<p>The ordinary mechanism for preventing such cost escalation would be that parents would choose the lower-priced centers over the higher-priced centers. But since parents pay a fixed percent of income regardless of which center they go to, that mechanism cannot operate. The 0 to 7 percent fee thus has all the downsides of &ldquo;skin in the game&rdquo; (the annoyance of out-of-pocket expenses) but none of the upsides (downward price pressure).</p>\n<h1>4</h1>\n<p>Some proponents of childcare benefits <a href=\"https://slate.com/business/2019/02/elizabeth-warren-new-child-care-proposal-real-deal.html\">argue</a> that it would hugely boost the output of the economy. But these claims seem a bit exaggerated.</p>\n<p>The general idea here is that, if childcare was more affordable, the employment rate would increase because people who currently cannot afford childcare will become able to do that. And once they are able to do that, they will be able to put their kid in day care and go to work rather than care for them in the home.</p>\n<p>The first problem with this argument is that it relies upon the fact that only market labor is counted towards the country&rsquo;s economic output. Thus, shifting some childcare from nonmarket labor to market labor mechanically boosts GDP even though it does not, by itself, increase the total amount of childcare being performed and thus does not actually increase total output.</p>\n<p>In response to this point, advocates will acknowledge that the GDP measure will overstate the gains considerably, but also point out that the stay-at-home parent who is now able to go to work might produce more in the labor market than they produce at home (i.e., the value of their market labor is higher than the value of their home-care labor).</p>\n<p>But the issue with this move is that the people who cannot currently afford childcare are also going to be disproportionately those whose market labor is not <em>that</em> &ldquo;valuable.&rdquo; Indeed, that is sort of the crux of their conundrum: they cannot afford childcare because their market labor does not fetch high enough wages.</p>\n<p>In response to this point, advocates will say that remaining attached to the labor force during this period will make the workers more productive later on in life because they will have more experience and more skills. That is, being locked out of the labor force for a few years in early adulthood is a long-term drag on human capital.</p>\n<p>This point &mdash; essentially a version of the hysteresis hypothesis for unemployment &mdash; is really the key to the theory of higher productivity, but as you can see it&rsquo;s quite a bit more diluted a point than the one advocates initially make.</p>\n<p>And even this point, which seems correct to me, may end up being a smaller deal than advocates think. Treatments of this issue assume that childcare benefits will cause larger increases in women&rsquo;s employment than they probably will. The reason for this error is that there is little mainstream acknowledgement of the fact that lagging women&rsquo;s labor force participation appears to be heavily <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2018/06/12/whats-behind-the-decline-in-women-working/\">driven</a> by recent <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/08/key-facts-about-asian-americans/\">increases</a> in immigration from Latin America and Asia. These populations are much more likely to organize their families along sole-earner / male-breadwinner lines than the overall population, which appears to be at least partially be culturally driven.</p>\n<p>All of this is to say that the case for free (or subsidized) childcare is not that it will significantly grow the economy. It is that it redistributes income to families with young children, easing their often-severe financial strain, and gives all parents the ability to work outside of the home if that is what they want to do.</p>",

                "text": "Elizabeth Warren unveiled a childcare proposal earlier this week. The basic idea is to charge parents a fee equal to 0 to 7 percent of their income to attend various local childcare options with the federal government making up the rest of the cost of that care via grants. I told the Washington Post\u2019s Jeff Stein that I thought it was a good start. Below are four other notes on it based on the way I think about this issue.\n1\nIn my Family Fun Pack program, parents are given the option of sending their kids to a free public childcare center or receiving a home childcare allowance if they prefer to care for young kids in the home. Warren\u2019s plan currently does not offer support to stay-at-home carers, though her 2006 book The Two-Income Trap acknowledges that such support has to be part of a childcare benefit system.\nHome childcare allowances, which provide cash to at-home carers, make a childcare benefit system equitable to all kinds of families and are especially important to rural people and immigrants, who disproportionately do childcare in the home.\n2\nNominal fees are not uncommon for childcare programs in the world, but I genuinely do not understand why they are being charged at all.\nIn the context of health care, the theory behind charging fees \u2014 deductibles, co-pays, coinsurance \u2014 to users is to discourage people from going to the doctor all the time. But this reasoning does not make sense in the context of childcare where we want people to utilize it and where it is not really possible to overutilize it in the same way that it is possible to overutilize health care.\nOne goal of charging the fees might be to raise revenue to fund the childcare system, but in that case it seems like you should use broad-based taxes that apply to all households not de facto 0 to 7 percent taxes applied only to households with children in childcare. It would be trivial to raise that amount of revenue from the universe of all households and would seemingly make the program more popular and fairer.\n3\nAs currently written, Warren\u2019s proposal does not appear to contain any mechanism for controlling the underlying costs of the childcare itself. It promises to cap user fees at 0 to 7 percent of income, but then appears to offer open-ended subsidies for the remaining charges of each childcare center. Unless the plan also specifically caps how much childcare centers can charge the government, there is nothing to prevent childcare centers from escalating costs at will.\nThe ordinary mechanism for preventing such cost escalation would be that parents would choose the lower-priced centers over the higher-priced centers. But since parents pay a fixed percent of income regardless of which center they go to, that mechanism cannot operate. The 0 to 7 percent fee thus has all the downsides of \u201cskin in the game\u201d (the annoyance of out-of-pocket expenses) but none of the upsides (downward price pressure).\n4\nSome proponents of childcare benefits argue that it would hugely boost the output of the economy. But these claims seem a bit exaggerated.\nThe general idea here is that, if childcare was more affordable, the employment rate would increase because people who currently cannot afford childcare will become able to do that. And once they are able to do that, they will be able to put their kid in day care and go to work rather than care for them in the home.\nThe first problem with this argument is that it relies upon the fact that only market labor is counted towards the country\u2019s economic output. Thus, shifting some childcare from nonmarket labor to market labor mechanically boosts GDP even though it does not, by itself, increase the total amount of childcare being performed and thus does not actually increase total output.\nIn response to this point, advocates will acknowledge that the GDP measure will overstate the gains considerably, but also point out that the stay-at-home parent who is now able to go to work might produce more in the labor market than they produce at home (i.e., the value of their market labor is higher than the value of their home-care labor).\nBut the issue with this move is that the people who cannot currently afford childcare are also going to be disproportionately those whose market labor is not that \u201cvaluable.\u201d Indeed, that is sort of the crux of their conundrum: they cannot afford childcare because their market labor does not fetch high enough wages.\nIn response to this point, advocates will say that remaining attached to the labor force during this period will make the workers more productive later on in life because they will have more experience and more skills. That is, being locked out of the labor force for a few years in early adulthood is a long-term drag on human capital.\nThis point \u2014 essentially a version of the hysteresis hypothesis for unemployment \u2014 is really the key to the theory of higher productivity, but as you can see it\u2019s quite a bit more diluted a point than the one advocates initially make.\nAnd even this point, which seems correct to me, may end up being a smaller deal than advocates think. Treatments of this issue assume that childcare benefits will cause larger increases in women\u2019s employment than they probably will. The reason for this error is that there is little mainstream acknowledgement of the fact that lagging women\u2019s labor force participation appears to be heavily driven by recent increases in immigration from Latin America and Asia. These populations are much more likely to organize their families along sole-earner / male-breadwinner lines than the overall population, which appears to be at least partially be culturally driven.\nAll of this is to say that the case for free (or subsidized) childcare is not that it will significantly grow the economy. It is that it redistributes income to families with young children, easing their often-severe financial strain, and gives all parents the ability to work outside of the home if that is what they want to do.",

Joe Brusky</p> </figcaption></figure>\n<p>On the first day of the Oakland teachers&rsquo; strike, I met up with Oakland teacher and union activist Tim Marshall at the rally downtown. Marshall has been an Oakland public school teacher for twenty-two years. He sits on the organizing committee for the <a href=\"https://oaklandea.org/\">Oakland Education Association</a> (OEA), the teachers union that&rsquo;s fighting for a living wage, smaller class sizes, more student supports, and an end to school closures. He&rsquo;s also a cluster leader, in charge of organizing union activity at a handful of school sites. And he&rsquo;s a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), having joined in the big post-Bernie membership wave.</p>\n<p>My name is Meagan Day. I&rsquo;m also a DSA member, as well as a staff writer for <em>Jacobin</em>. I interviewed Marshall on Thursday in Oakland, to get a sense of what&rsquo;s really at stake in the teachers&rsquo; fight.</p>\n<p>Marshall and I peeled off the rally the pickets had converged into, and settled into a restaurant called Ed&rsquo;s Cheesesteak. From our booth, we could hear more than five thousand teachers chanting and singing outside City Hall. Before the interview began, Marshall got a phone call from a leader at one of his school sites. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a propaganda war right now,&rdquo; he told the organizer on the other end. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you take attendance. We need to show that we shut it down.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Marshall hung up and pulled up an app on his phone that showed attendance percentages at schools across the city. Many of them were in the single digits. He pointed to one, a major aberration with a thirty percent attendance rate. &ldquo;This is a problem,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be sending DSA members out to this picket tomorrow morning to make sure this doesn&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I talked with Marshall about the Oakland teachers&rsquo; fight, the role of billionaires in dismantling public education, what&rsquo;s so undemocratic about charter schools, and the right of every student to an equitably funded school that reflects and responds to the community where they live.</p>\n<p>After the interview, we walked outside to find nurses from the California Nurses Association chanting, &ldquo;Without teachers, we wouldn&rsquo;t be nurses!&rdquo; and elementary school children chanting, &ldquo;Get up, get down, Oakland is a union town!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>MD</p>\n<p>In January, the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) announced that they were <a href=\"http://www.oaklandpost.org/2018/11/30/oakland-unified-moves-forward-plan-close-24-schools/\">considering closing</a> twenty-four of the district&rsquo;s eighty-six public schools. Since then, opposition to school closures has been integrated into OEA&rsquo;s demands, alongside the original three: a living wage, smaller class sizes, and more student support staff.</p>\n<p>In the media, the school closures issue is getting less attention than the other three. I heard a segment on the radio this morning that neglected to mention it. But in a way, it&rsquo;s the framing demand, because it&rsquo;s the greatest threat to public education in Oakland.</p>\n<p>What is the district threatening to do, and what&rsquo;s their broader agenda?</p>\n<p>TM</p>\n<p>The district recently announced the official closure of two schools, one in the hills and one in the flatlands, but both are part of a massive downsizing plan that they have, a blueprint for the district that is similar to what&rsquo;s called the portfolio model.</p>\n<p>The portfolio model is a model in which districts pit schools against each other, assess them based on criteria that are not necessarily the criteria of the community, and close the underperforming ones, ultimately reducing the number of schools in a public school system. Proponents of this model speak about schools in the language of corporate competition: investments, bargaining chips, productive and non-productive assets.</p>\n<p>The district meant to phase this in, but word got out and now Oakland parents are up in arms about their kids&rsquo; schools being closed. The people on the school board are defending it as a cost-cutting measure, which is not true even according to their own internal documents, which we&rsquo;ve seen. It doesn&rsquo;t save them a substantial amount of money. It only makes sense if you understand that it&rsquo;s part of a bigger plan, which is to hand over closed schools to charter school operators and/or sell off properties to developers to transform and gentrify Oakland.</p>\n<p>MD</p>\n<p>In the public sector, austerity is only superficially about saving money. California has the highest concentration of billionaires in the nation, and we could end austerity in public education in a heartbeat.</p>\n<p>But there are two main reasons this doesn&rsquo;t happen. First, rich people control our political system and fight tooth and nail for tax breaks for themselves. And second, austerity is a pretext for privatization, which promises to make rich people even richer. Can you tell me how that works in education?</p>\n<p>TM</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s right. Oakland has already closed over a dozen schools in the last decade, and those schools have almost all been replaced by charter school operations. Partly that&rsquo;s because of Proposition 39, which is the charter school law in California, and partly it&rsquo;s because of the school board&rsquo;s own bias and their plans to encourage privatization.</p>\n<p>This is a long-standing policy of the district. In 2003, they proposed giving away thirteen of their own schools to the charter school companies. I was one of the organizers who went out to those schools, told teachers and communities what their rights were, and talked to them about how to fight back, and we saved eleven of those public schools.</p>\n<p>But those schools were severely underfunded, were labeled underperforming as a result, and are on the chopping block again. So our union has taken up ending school closures as a key demand, one we&rsquo;re trying to bring to the bargaining table.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re inspired in part by the <a href=\"https://www.ktvu.com/news/385351174-video\">incredible resistance</a> from the community at Roots International Academy. Teachers, parents, and students at Roots have been fighting the closure of their school for months.</p>\n<p>Roots is a small, underfunded school in East Oakland. It serves students in the Havenscourt neighborhood, one of the poorest in Oakland. Almost all of the students are black and brown. These students are being punished for predictably low test scores, even though what test scores measure most is poverty, lack of access to resources and support.</p>\n<p>The district offered a couple of alternatives when they announced they were closing Roots. One is something called a &ldquo;golden ticket&rdquo; which supposedly gives students entrance into a better school someplace else in Oakland. That could mean a charter school or a public school in the hills.</p>\n<p>Not only are the students unlikely to be able to physically get to these schools, but it undermines the idea that students should be able to go to a school in their neighborhood, one that reflects and unifies their community, is funded equitably, and offers a high-quality public education.</p>\n<p>Another option the district floated is a public school site thirty-two blocks away, down International Boulevard, which is a dangerous walk for anybody. A lot of these students don&rsquo;t have money for the bus both ways every day. It&rsquo;s an area of high crime and high sex trafficking, so to send middle-school age students down that street for thirty-two blocks is lunacy.</p>\n<p>MD</p>\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not really what&rsquo;s going to happen, anyway. Roots has a physical school structure, and it won&rsquo;t sit empty for long. A charter school will probably just open up in its place and many of those kids will end up going there, right?</p>\n<p>TM</p>\n<p>The community loses. Charter school companies win, and the billionaires who are funding the school privatization movement win.</p>\n<p>And not all of them are charter school operators, they&rsquo;re just ideologically committed to dismantling public education. The Koch brothers are smart. They understand what&rsquo;s at stake. They understand that by pushing this agenda, they will break unions as they have done in cities like New Orleans, which has <u><a href=\"https://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/news/education/article_9e7c55fc-0471-11e9-8c4c-e3f94b3162f1.html\">no public schools left</a></u> and therefore <u><a href=\"https://edreform.com/2014/09/new-orleans-charter-school-union-talks-proceed-but-no-copycats-yet/\">basically no union presence</a></u> in education.</p>\n<p>And they know that they can dismantle the social expectation of quality public education for all. They want to subject education to free-market principles, and usher in an era in which all schools, teachers, and students compete against each other for survival.</p>\n<p>MD</p>\n<p>Reed Hastings <u><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/03/14/netflixs-reed-hastings-has-a-big-idea-kill-elected-school-boards/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.0491a58e0d37\">has even said</a></u> that charter schools are preferable because they have &ldquo;stable governance&rdquo; instead of rotating school boards. Of course the very reason we have school boards is so they can be elected, democratic, and accountable to the public.</p>\n<p>As it stands, the democratic nature of school boards is compromised by the fact that billionaires like Hastings throw so much money into school board elections. The solution to that is to get big money out of those races. But a guy like Hastings envisions instead a libertarian dystopia where all decisions about education are made by private corporations behind closed doors.</p>\n<p>TM</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why charter schools are their dream. Charter schools are all about public funding and private control. They are not subject to the same transparency laws. They don&rsquo;t have the same kind of oversight and accountability &mdash; even the nominal accountability that we hope for in Oakland and don&rsquo;t always receive. But at least we can set that demand. Nobody can set that demand on the board of a private charter school company and expect it to be met.</p>\n<p>Neighborhood schools are given over to these fly-by-night companies, and they can stay or leave, unionize or not. Communities lose their right to demand specific outcomes, and to affect change inside of a school system.</p>\n<p>For a long time I taught third grade at an elementary school in East Oakland. It went through this process of being condemned as a failing school. We fought to demand that it stay open, and we transformed it into a new school. We had to give it a new name, but the staff remained intact mostly, and we fought successfully to preserve the rights of the community that we had worked so hard to build relationships with.</p>\n<aside>Billionaires see that public-sector unionism is one of the last bastions of an organized working class, and a defender of the rights not only of union members but also the democratic rights of the broader community. And that&rsquo;s an obstacle. They want it all. They want the whole pie.</aside>\n<p>Those rights would not have been respected by a charter school. For instance, I&rsquo;m a bilingual teacher and we provided bilingual education. The community decided that&rsquo;s what they wanted, the teachers supported and provided that. But a charter has no obligation to listen to the community. They don&rsquo;t have to listen to anyone besides CEOs.</p>\n<p>Worse yet, charter schools often accept kids who don&rsquo;t speak English well or kids with special needs or behavioral problems, count them at the beginning of the year and receive funding for them, and then over the course of the year &ldquo;counsel them out.&rdquo; That means pressuring their parents to take them out of the charter school, so the school&rsquo;s test scores will remain high and they will attract more customers. It&rsquo;s called dumping.</p>\n<p>TM</p>\n<p>To a great extent. We all know that union density and union membership in the United States has fallen off precipitously, especially in the last two or three decades. But billionaires aren&rsquo;t content. They see that public-sector unionism is one of the last bastions of an organized working class, and a defender of the rights not only of union members but also the democratic rights of the broader community. And that&rsquo;s an obstacle. They want it all. They want the whole pie.</p>\n<p>In education specifically, Oakland is a laboratory in which privatizers have been successful at establishing a foothold, and getting their ideas to become prevalent among school board members and high-ranking members of the administration. To do that, they&rsquo;ve needed to delegitimize the public school system. And in order to make their case, they&rsquo;ve starved us into austerity.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why they pack us into classrooms, it&rsquo;s why the heat in my room only occasionally works, it&rsquo;s why the windows don&rsquo;t close properly during smoke days caused by devastating wildfires, it&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s mold in the classrooms, it&rsquo;s why there aren&rsquo;t enough adults to safely staff most of the schools, it&rsquo;s why there aren&rsquo;t enough nurses or counselors, and so on.</p>\n<p>MD</p>\n<p>A terrible consequence is that in pointing to the effects of austerity to delegitimize public education, the privatizers have actually persuaded some people in social justice circles too. I&rsquo;ve heard people who care about racism, for example, justify charters by talking about the &ldquo;harm that the public school system has done to black and brown kids,&rdquo; not realizing that what they mean is the harm that <em>egregious</em> <em>underfunding </em>has done to those kids.</p>\n<p>I think that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re getting at &mdash; that part of the privatizers&rsquo; strategy is to make public education seem not worth defending. To make us feel like there&rsquo;s something flawed, maybe even something dangerous about public schools, and to get us to give up on the idea.</p>\n<p>TM</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s like the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA was created with a piece of progressive legislation, but it&rsquo;s now being run into the ground on purpose by Trump to pave the way for shutting it down altogether. The same is happening in many cities across the nation to public education.</p>\n<p>Public education is ours. The fight for public education is a fight by and for the working class, from the earliest attempts to build something like it in Massachusetts in the 1830s and 40s, through the <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/07/the-socialist-case-for-school-integration\">desegregation fights</a> of the 1950s and 60s, continuing into these fights today to preserve public education for all &mdash; not for a few, not for a talented tenth, but for everyone.</p>\n<p>In Oakland there is literally a chief officer in charge of &ldquo;innovation,&rdquo; but what she&rsquo;s really in charge of is innovating us out of existence, closing schools and transforming them into charters. Those charters may or may not be innovative on their own, but I&rsquo;m telling you that they are undemocratic, they are often corrupt, and they are not the key to providing quality public education for all.</p>\n<p>TM</p>\n<p>I was a bilingual instructional aide in Los Angeles when I was a college student. There I met some people who became instrumental in the United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA) reform movement, including some young kid everybody was talking about named Alex Caputo-Pearl, who is now the president of the union and led their phenomenally successful strike last month.</p>\n<p>And then in 1992 I went to Chicago and worked for a short time as a substitute. There I worked with members of what would eventually become the <a href=\"https://www.coreteachers.org/\">Caucus of Rank and File Educators</a> (CORE), which led their groundbreaking strike in 2012. Back then, the victories of 2012 were just a gleam in their eye. Just like in Los Angeles, they had a dream of organizing a rank-and-file resistance to a union misleadership and of connecting community struggles to labor struggles.</p>\n<p>So I&rsquo;ve been familiar with reform efforts inside teachers&rsquo; unions for many decades. And I will say it has sometimes seemed like a long and lonely struggle. But this moment is different. People who aren&rsquo;t us seem to be understanding what&rsquo;s at stake.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s more sympathy for the labor movement in general from the public, and there&rsquo;s more support for strikes within the labor movement. This strike, for example, has seen a lot of support from our AFSCME and SEIU brothers and sisters, just to name a couple.</p>\n<p>I think the additional wild card has been these young people. The young people of our union are much more fearless resisters against their principals. They&rsquo;re also much more vulnerable, because the rents are rising and the reality of being a twenty-five-year-old teacher is not the same as when I did it. They never paid us well in Oakland, but rent in Oakland used to be cheap.</p>\n<p>And the support of younger socialists has been crucial. It&rsquo;s not like how it used to be, with radicals isolated in their unions, the residual effects of the Cold War and red-baiting forcing them to disguise their politics. DSA is much more out front.</p>\n<p>The role that East Bay DSA has played has been really welcome in the union. There are DSA members who are teachers on the organizing committee, and there were DSA members out on picket lines all over town this morning. In the lead-up to the strike DSA has cosponsored events with the union and taken on a huge logistical burden to make them happen. <a href=\"https://donorbox.org/breadfored\">Bread for Ed</a>, a massive fundraiser to feed kids during the strike, would not have happened without DSA. Much of the solidarity school organizing would not have happened without DSA.</p>\n<p>The other day I had an exchange with our union president Keith Brown. I said, &ldquo;Thank you for all you do,&rdquo; and he responded, &ldquo;No thank <em>you </em>brother. You brought the squad.&rdquo; And by the squad he meant DSA.</p>\n<p>The union leadership understands that the messaging of this fight can&rsquo;t just about bread and butter for teachers, it also has to be about building better community schools and fighting off a mean-spirited and antidemocratic attack on public education. So that perspective was already there in the union.</p>\n<p>But the union leadership has been very appreciative of the role DSA has played, and the cross-fertilization of ideas between the union leadership and DSA activists has helped our messaging take on a new character, emphasizing class struggle against the billionaires.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s going to help us in this fight if we can link the struggles of the community to the not-so-secret plans of billionaires and privatizers to dismantle public education. The socialist vision is helping stiffen our resistance to that plan. And I think it&rsquo;s resonating with all these people right outside of this restaurant.</p>",

                "text": "On the first day of the Oakland teachers\u2019 strike, I met up with Oakland teacher and union activist Tim Marshall at the rally downtown. Marshall has been an Oakland public school teacher for twenty-two years. He sits on the organizing committee for the Oakland Education Association (OEA), the teachers union that\u2019s fighting for a living wage, smaller class sizes, more student supports, and an end to school closures. He\u2019s also a cluster leader, in charge of organizing union activity at a handful of school sites. And he\u2019s a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), having joined in the big post-Bernie membership wave.\nMy name is Meagan Day. I\u2019m also a DSA member, as well as a staff writer for Jacobin. I interviewed Marshall on Thursday in Oakland, to get a sense of what\u2019s really at stake in the teachers\u2019 fight.\nMarshall and I peeled off the rally the pickets had converged into, and settled into a restaurant called Ed\u2019s Cheesesteak. From our booth, we could hear more than five thousand teachers chanting and singing outside City Hall. Before the interview began, Marshall got a phone call from a leader at one of his school sites. \u201cIt\u2019s a propaganda war right now,\u201d he told the organizer on the other end. \u201cThat\u2019s why you take attendance. We need to show that we shut it down.\u201d\nMarshall hung up and pulled up an app on his phone that showed attendance percentages at schools across the city. Many of them were in the single digits. He pointed to one, a major aberration with a thirty percent attendance rate. \u201cThis is a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be sending DSA members out to this picket tomorrow morning to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\nI talked with Marshall about the Oakland teachers\u2019 fight, the role of billionaires in dismantling public education, what\u2019s so undemocratic about charter schools, and the right of every student to an equitably funded school that reflects and responds to the community where they live.\nAfter the interview, we walked outside to find nurses from the California Nurses Association chanting, \u201cWithout teachers, we wouldn\u2019t be nurses!\u201d and elementary school children chanting, \u201cGet up, get down, Oakland is a union town!\u201d\nMD\nIn January, the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) announced that they were considering closing twenty-four of the district\u2019s eighty-six public schools. Since then, opposition to school closures has been integrated into OEA\u2019s demands, alongside the original three: a living wage, smaller class sizes, and more student support staff.\nIn the media, the school closures issue is getting less attention than the other three. I heard a segment on the radio this morning that neglected to mention it. But in a way, it\u2019s the framing demand, because it\u2019s the greatest threat to public education in Oakland.\nWhat is the district threatening to do, and what\u2019s their broader agenda?\nTM\nThe district recently announced the official closure of two schools, one in the hills and one in the flatlands, but both are part of a massive downsizing plan that they have, a blueprint for the district that is similar to what\u2019s called the portfolio model.\nThe portfolio model is a model in which districts pit schools against each other, assess them based on criteria that are not necessarily the criteria of the community, and close the underperforming ones, ultimately reducing the number of schools in a public school system. Proponents of this model speak about schools in the language of corporate competition: investments, bargaining chips, productive and non-productive assets.\nThe district meant to phase this in, but word got out and now Oakland parents are up in arms about their kids\u2019 schools being closed. The people on the school board are defending it as a cost-cutting measure, which is not true even according to their own internal documents, which we\u2019ve seen. It doesn\u2019t save them a substantial amount of money. It only makes sense if you understand that it\u2019s part of a bigger plan, which is to hand over closed schools to charter school operators and/or sell off properties to developers to transform and gentrify Oakland.\nMD\nIn the public sector, austerity is only superficially about saving money. California has the highest concentration of billionaires in the nation, and we could end austerity in public education in a heartbeat.\nBut there are two main reasons this doesn\u2019t happen. First, rich people control our political system and fight tooth and nail for tax breaks for themselves. And second, austerity is a pretext for privatization, which promises to make rich people even richer. Can you tell me how that works in education?\nTM\nThat\u2019s right. Oakland has already closed over a dozen schools in the last decade, and those schools have almost all been replaced by charter school operations. Partly that\u2019s because of Proposition 39, which is the charter school law in California, and partly it\u2019s because of the school board\u2019s own bias and their plans to encourage privatization.\nThis is a long-standing policy of the district. In 2003, they proposed giving away thirteen of their own schools to the charter school companies. I was one of the organizers who went out to those schools, told teachers and communities what their rights were, and talked to them about how to fight back, and we saved eleven of those public schools.\nBut those schools were severely underfunded, were labeled underperforming as a result, and are on the chopping block again. So our union has taken up ending school closures as a key demand, one we\u2019re trying to bring to the bargaining table.\nWe\u2019re inspired in part by the incredible resistance from the community at Roots International Academy. Teachers, parents, and students at Roots have been fighting the closure of their school for months.\nRoots is a small, underfunded school in East Oakland. It serves students in the Havenscourt neighborhood, one of the poorest in Oakland. Almost all of the students are black and brown. These students are being punished for predictably low test scores, even though what test scores measure most is poverty, lack of access to resources and support.\nThe district offered a couple of alternatives when they announced they were closing Roots. One is something called a \u201cgolden ticket\u201d which supposedly gives students entrance into a better school someplace else in Oakland. That could mean a charter school or a public school in the hills.\nNot only are the students unlikely to be able to physically get to these schools, but it undermines the idea that students should be able to go to a school in their neighborhood, one that reflects and unifies their community, is funded equitably, and offers a high-quality public education.\nAnother option the district floated is a public school site thirty-two blocks away, down International Boulevard, which is a dangerous walk for anybody. A lot of these students don\u2019t have money for the bus both ways every day. It\u2019s an area of high crime and high sex trafficking, so to send middle-school age students down that street for thirty-two blocks is lunacy.\nMD\nBut that\u2019s not really what\u2019s going to happen, anyway. Roots has a physical school structure, and it won\u2019t sit empty for long. A charter school will probably just open up in its place and many of those kids will end up going there, right?\nTM\nThe community loses. Charter school companies win, and the billionaires who are funding the school privatization movement win.\nAnd not all of them are charter school operators, they\u2019re just ideologically committed to dismantling public education. The Koch brothers are smart. They understand what\u2019s at stake. They understand that by pushing this agenda, they will break unions as they have done in cities like New Orleans, which has no public schools left and therefore basically no union presence in education.\nAnd they know that they can dismantle the social expectation of quality public education for all. They want to subject education to free-market principles, and usher in an era in which all schools, teachers, and students compete against each other for survival.\nMD\nReed Hastings has even said that charter schools are preferable because they have \u201cstable governance\u201d instead of rotating school boards. Of course the very reason we have school boards is so they can be elected, democratic, and accountable to the public.\nAs it stands, the democratic nature of school boards is compromised by the fact that billionaires like Hastings throw so much money into school board elections. The solution to that is to get big money out of those races. But a guy like Hastings envisions instead a libertarian dystopia where all decisions about education are made by private corporations behind closed doors.\nTM\nThat\u2019s why charter schools are their dream. Charter schools are all about public funding and private control. They are not subject to the same transparency laws. They don\u2019t have the same kind of oversight and accountability \u2014 even the nominal accountability that we hope for in Oakland and don\u2019t always receive. But at least we can set that demand. Nobody can set that demand on the board of a private charter school company and expect it to be met.\nNeighborhood schools are given over to these fly-by-night companies, and they can stay or leave, unionize or not. Communities lose their right to demand specific outcomes, and to affect change inside of a school system.\nFor a long time I taught third grade at an elementary school in East Oakland. It went through this process of being condemned as a failing school. We fought to demand that it stay open, and we transformed it into a new school. We had to give it a new name, but the staff remained intact mostly, and we fought successfully to preserve the rights of the community that we had worked so hard to build relationships with.\nBillionaires see that public-sector unionism is one of the last bastions of an organized working class, and a defender of the rights not only of union members but also the democratic rights of the broader community. And that\u2019s an obstacle. They want it all. They want the whole pie.\nThose rights would not have been respected by a charter school. For instance, I\u2019m a bilingual teacher and we provided bilingual education. The community decided that\u2019s what they wanted, the teachers supported and provided that. But a charter has no obligation to listen to the community. They don\u2019t have to listen to anyone besides CEOs.\nWorse yet, charter schools often accept kids who don\u2019t speak English well or kids with special needs or behavioral problems, count them at the beginning of the year and receive funding for them, and then over the course of the year \u201ccounsel them out.\u201d That means pressuring their parents to take them out of the charter school, so the school\u2019s test scores will remain high and they will attract more customers. It\u2019s called dumping.\nTM\nTo a great extent. We all know that union density and union membership in the United States has fallen off precipitously, especially in the last two or three decades. But billionaires aren\u2019t content. They see that public-sector unionism is one of the last bastions of an organized working class, and a defender of the rights not only of union members but also the democratic rights of the broader community. And that\u2019s an obstacle. They want it all. They want the whole pie.\nIn education specifically, Oakland is a laboratory in which privatizers have been successful at establishing a foothold, and getting their ideas to become prevalent among school board members and high-ranking members of the administration. To do that, they\u2019ve needed to delegitimize the public school system. And in order to make their case, they\u2019ve starved us into austerity.\nThat\u2019s why they pack us into classrooms, it\u2019s why the heat in my room only occasionally works, it\u2019s why the windows don\u2019t close properly during smoke days caused by devastating wildfires, it\u2019s why there\u2019s mold in the classrooms, it\u2019s why there aren\u2019t enough adults to safely staff most of the schools, it\u2019s why there aren\u2019t enough nurses or counselors, and so on.\nMD\nA terrible consequence is that in pointing to the effects of austerity to delegitimize public education, the privatizers have actually persuaded some people in social justice circles too. I\u2019ve heard people who care about racism, for example, justify charters by talking about the \u201charm that the public school system has done to black and brown kids,\u201d not realizing that what they mean is the harm that egregious underfunding has done to those kids.\nI think that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at \u2014 that part of the privatizers\u2019 strategy is to make public education seem not worth defending. To make us feel like there\u2019s something flawed, maybe even something dangerous about public schools, and to get us to give up on the idea.\nTM\nIt\u2019s like the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA was created with a piece of progressive legislation, but it\u2019s now being run into the ground on purpose by Trump to pave the way for shutting it down altogether. The same is happening in many cities across the nation to public education.\nPublic education is ours. The fight for public education is a fight by and for the working class, from the earliest attempts to build something like it in Massachusetts in the 1830s and 40s, through the desegregation fights of the 1950s and 60s, continuing into these fights today to preserve public education for all \u2014 not for a few, not for a talented tenth, but for everyone.\nIn Oakland there is literally a chief officer in charge of \u201cinnovation,\u201d but what she\u2019s really in charge of is innovating us out of existence, closing schools and transforming them into charters. Those charters may or may not be innovative on their own, but I\u2019m telling you that they are undemocratic, they are often corrupt, and they are not the key to providing quality public education for all.\nTM\nI was a bilingual instructional aide in Los Angeles when I was a college student. There I met some people who became instrumental in the United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA) reform movement, including some young kid everybody was talking about named Alex Caputo-Pearl, who is now the president of the union and led their phenomenally successful strike last month.\nAnd then in 1992 I went to Chicago and worked for a short time as a substitute. There I worked with members of what would eventually become the Caucus of Rank and File Educators (CORE), which led their groundbreaking strike in 2012. Back then, the victories of 2012 were just a gleam in their eye. Just like in Los Angeles, they had a dream of organizing a rank-and-file resistance to a union misleadership and of connecting community struggles to labor struggles.\nSo I\u2019ve been familiar with reform efforts inside teachers\u2019 unions for many decades. And I will say it has sometimes seemed like a long and lonely struggle. But this moment is different. People who aren\u2019t us seem to be understanding what\u2019s at stake.\nThere\u2019s more sympathy for the labor movement in general from the public, and there\u2019s more support for strikes within the labor movement. This strike, for example, has seen a lot of support from our AFSCME and SEIU brothers and sisters, just to name a couple.\nI think the additional wild card has been these young people. The young people of our union are much more fearless resisters against their principals. They\u2019re also much more vulnerable, because the rents are rising and the reality of being a twenty-five-year-old teacher is not the same as when I did it. They never paid us well in Oakland, but rent in Oakland used to be cheap.\nAnd the support of younger socialists has been crucial. It\u2019s not like how it used to be, with radicals isolated in their unions, the residual effects of the Cold War and red-baiting forcing them to disguise their politics. DSA is much more out front.\nThe role that East Bay DSA has played has been really welcome in the union. There are DSA members who are teachers on the organizing committee, and there were DSA members out on picket lines all over town this morning. In the lead-up to the strike DSA has cosponsored events with the union and taken on a huge logistical burden to make them happen. Bread for Ed, a massive fundraiser to feed kids during the strike, would not have happened without DSA. Much of the solidarity school organizing would not have happened without DSA.\nThe other day I had an exchange with our union president Keith Brown. I said, \u201cThank you for all you do,\u201d and he responded, \u201cNo thank you brother. You brought the squad.\u201d And by the squad he meant DSA.\nThe union leadership understands that the messaging of this fight can\u2019t just about bread and butter for teachers, it also has to be about building better community schools and fighting off a mean-spirited and antidemocratic attack on public education. So that perspective was already there in the union.\nBut the union leadership has been very appreciative of the role DSA has played, and the cross-fertilization of ideas between the union leadership and DSA activists has helped our messaging take on a new character, emphasizing class struggle against the billionaires.\nIt\u2019s going to help us in this fight if we can link the struggles of the community to the not-so-secret plans of billionaires and privatizers to dismantle public education. The socialist vision is helping stiffen our resistance to that plan. And I think it\u2019s resonating with all these people right outside of this restaurant.",

If we want to build public support for socialism we must make foreign policy part of our analysis.</p>\n<p>We need to be able to explain clearly why the United States is perpetually involved in hot and cold wars; and offer a clear pathway to a different foreign policy that serves the true interests of the vast majority of Americans and the desires of people around the world for freedom from war, environmental disaster, economic oppression, and political repression.</p>\n<p>This country&rsquo;s military budget, trade agreements, foreign &ldquo;aid,&rdquo; military alliances, and wars all are designed to further the interests of capitalists and of what <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/the-power-elite-9780195133547?cc=us&lang=en&\">C. Wright Mills</a> called the military elite. We need to recognize that at times some capitalists are in conflict with others and that the military elite has its own interests that go beyond making the world safe for American capitalism. Those differences provide leverage for the rest of us to challenge existing foreign policy. However, our main strength comes from showing how most people are harmed rather than helped when the government serves narrow elite interests.</p>\n<p>Ever since the 1930s the US government has pushed for trade agreements that give American companies access to foreign markets. At the same time, the United States has used military and non-military means to remove governments that tried to restrict capitalists&rsquo; ability to exploit resources and workers in other countries or to create social protections for their citizens. Obviously, the United States is less able to intervene in other wealthy countries, like those of Western Europe, even as America&rsquo;s ability to mold other nations to its will has increased since the end of the Soviet Union.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/05/trans-pacific-parternship-china-united-states-asia/\">US goals in trade treaties</a> have changed over time. Up to the 1960s, the government pushed to open foreign markets to American manufactured goods. But as America&rsquo;s industrial edge disappeared, the United States instead has sought to win access for financial firms above all. It also aims to protect American pharmaceutical, software, and entertainment firms&rsquo; patents and copyrights. In essence, since the 1970s, American trade negotiators have sacrificed industrial workers to protect the profits of Wall Street, Big Pharma, Silicon Valley, and Hollywood.</p>\n<aside>Our foreign policy&rsquo;s primary goal should be to unite workers across borders to limit the power of capitalists.</aside>\n<p>The United States&rsquo; trade strategies and interventionist tactics reflect the power that American capitalists as a class, and a shifting set of the most privileged corporations, exert over the US government. As socialists, we need to present this reality and refute the false claim that trade treaties are win-win outcomes for people throughout the world. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/03/sanders-trump-nafta-tpp-china-mexico-populists/\">workers everywhere</a> are harmed by the trade treaties their governments negotiate.</p>\n<p>We need to note that American trade policies have been consistent over Democratic as well as Republican administrations. Claims that &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; trade treaties protect workers or the environment were as false under Obama and Clinton as they are under Trump. Moreover, they harm workers in China as well as in the United States. The game Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/03/donald-trump-tariffs-protectionism-trade\">claims to be playing</a>, of extracting concessions from China that will benefit American workers, is as misleading as the promises that Obama and all his predecessors made about the benefits of their latest trade treaty.</p>\n<p>The US military, like those of most countries, protects its nation&rsquo;s capitalist investments abroad. <a href=\"http://americanempireproject.com/a-peoples-history-of-american-empire/\">Howard Zinn</a>, among many scholars, documented numerous instances of American invasions or intimidation to ensure that US corporations could keep the plantations, mines, factories, and other facilities they owned abroad. Sometimes, the United States intervenes to protect foreign capitalists&rsquo; investments, as when the CIA overthrew the democratically elected government of Iran in 1953 after it nationalized British owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.</p>\n<p>As the United States&rsquo; edge over other military powers has widened, it rarely needs to actually send troops to overthrow governments. The mere fact of US military dominance serves to intimidate other governments and prevents other countries from challenging America&rsquo;s ability to set the terms of international trade and diplomacy.</p>\n<p>Such power is enormously expensive to build and maintain. It requires a vast, permanent military establishment. Any organization, like the Pentagon, which commands millions of soldiers and other employees and controls a budget approaching $1 trillion a year, amasses great political power and autonomy as well &mdash; both abroad and within US institutions.</p>\n<p>The US is unusual among nations in that from its beginning it relied upon private companies to develop and build weaponry. Weapons contracts generate greater profit margins than most other businesses, creating a unity of interests between military officers and capitalists, who otherwise oppose expensive government programs that ultimately must be funded through taxes.</p>\n<p>Generals&rsquo; views of how to fight wars and what weaponry they need are shaped, indeed determined, by the way their careers are structured. Officers spend their careers assigned to units that man and deploy specific weapons systems. They advance by commanding expensive and technically complex weapons. Winning appropriations for those weapons systems ensures long careers for the ever-expanding corps of generals. Budget cuts or more drastically the cancellation of a weapons system would stymie or end the careers of officers in that military division.</p>\n<p>Weapons systems also reward officers in their retirement. Defense firms often hire retired military officers, and the promise of high corporate salaries to supplement their pensions gives officers a powerful incentive not to question the worth of expensive weapons systems, or to dispute contractors&rsquo; bills and pricing decisions.</p>\n<p>These career and organizational imperatives mesh perfectly with defense firms&rsquo; interest in selling advanced weapons systems, which consistently yield the largest profits. Thus, advanced weapons continue to absorb the lion&rsquo;s share of the Pentagon budget even though those weapons are fundamentally ill suited for the actual wars the United States fights in the twenty-first century.</p>\n<p>The United States&rsquo; overwhelming military power is complemented by a system of alliances spanning much of the globe. However, relations with other countries are increasingly managed by the military rather than the State Department. The Defense Department since World War II has cultivated direct ties with their military counterparts elsewhere in the world, as has the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>\n<p>In addition, the military and CIA sustain independent relations with civilian officials of many foreign governments. The Pentagon has created &ldquo;commands&rdquo; for each region of the world, headed by senior generals or admirals, who negotiate directly with both military and civilian officials in the countries of those regions about policy matters that extend far beyond military cooperation. These commands endure across presidential administrations and thus provide more continuity in US strategic policies and foreign relations than do the civilian side of the US government.</p>\n<p>Ties between the United States and foreign militaries are further cemented through arms sales since purchasers remain dependent on the United States for training and intelligence. Arms sales abroad also bolster manufacturers&rsquo; profits, providing a powerful incentive for American capitalists to support their government&rsquo;s ties to even the most brutal regimes in the world, as we see now with Saudi Arabia. In addition, <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/how-does-us-spend-its-foreign-aid\">a third of America&rsquo;s measly foreign aid budget</a>, which comes to less than 1 percent of the total Federal budget, is devoted to subsidizing other countries&rsquo; weapons purchases.</p>\n<p>The Pentagon&rsquo;s common interests with capitalists, and its increasingly independent links to other governments, makes it difficult for civilian officials &mdash; including presidents &mdash; to challenge the military&rsquo;s war plans. The Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq wars continued for years after it became clear the commanding generals were delusional about the prospects for victory, and as the death toll of both US soldiers and civilians in the countries the United States had invaded mounted. The United States has almost <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321\">eight hundred bases</a> in more than seventy countries around the world. Those bases expose US troops stationed there to potential attacks, which then become justification for sending more troops and increasing &ldquo;anti-terrorism&rdquo; spending. American soldiers offer &ldquo;training&rdquo; to foreign armies, and in so doing insert themselves into the politics and conflicts of the countries where they are based. Since World War II the United States has tried to overthrow governments in <a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/overthrowing-other-peoples-governments-the-master-list-of-u-s-regime-changes/5400829\">sixty countries</a>, and succeeded in thirty-four of them.</p>\n<p>It is not enough to say what is wrong with US military and foreign policy. We need to present a socialist alternative. Our foreign policy&rsquo;s primary goal should be to unite workers across borders to limit the power of capitalists. Capitalists gain a huge advantage from their ability to move money around the globe. The <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/02/capital-strike-regulations-lending-productivity-economy-banks-bailout\">threat of a capital strike</a> or of capital flight is used to break unions; force left governments to reduce social benefits; and cancel environmental, financial, and business regulation.</p>\n<p>The United States clearly has the leverage to reverse pro-capitalist policies. After all it has used its power, as we noted above, to impose trade treaties and to intimidate or replace foreign governments. We need to demand that our government instead ally with left governments and popular forces around the world to enact very different sorts of treaties: ones that end money laundering and movements of &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money by forcing banks around the world to identify the true owners of capital, tax treaties that impose uniform and highly progressive rates so that capitalists can&rsquo;t park money in tax shelters, and trade treaties that require exporting countries and firms to uphold living wages, strong health and safety regulations, and favor products made by unionized workers.</p>\n<p>Bernie Sanders was correct <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-says-climate-change-is-the-biggest-national-security-threat_us_5b564ddee4b0cf38668f8d04\">when he said</a> that climate change is the greatest national security threat faced by the United States; it is also the greatest threat facing humans the world over.</p>\n<p>American efforts to limit fossil fuels were nonexistent before 2009; then uneven and pathetically weak under Obama. Now, Trump is actively fostering oil and coal production domestically and around the world.</p>\n<p>The rich countries of the world, who in the centuries of fossil fuel use have emitted most of the CO2 in the atmosphere, need to immediately sign a treaty committing them to end fossil fuel use within a decade. The United States can use its economic and diplomatic power to pressure its fellow oil/coal producers and users to make this transition, with the threat that rich countries that continue to use fossil fuels will have their exports embargoed.</p>\n<p>At the same time, foreign aid now needs to be focused on helping poor nations make a rapid transition to green energy and on conserving forests and wetlands. The United States needs to recognize that in its budget and encourage other rich countries to do the same.</p>\n<p>Wars in their destruction of human life are immoral and almost always fought for evil reasons: to further capitalist exploitation, to allow militaries to self-aggrandize themselves and the politicians who fund them, and to allow powerful groups to dominate weaker ones. Because the United States has such an overwhelming edge in arms and technology, American disarmament can be leveraged to gain commitments by others to disarm. We need to demand that the US government immediately stop all arms sales, withdraw its soldiers from the vast archipelago of bases it holds around the world, and to stop any sort of military cooperation with repressive regimes.</p>\n<p>Human rights can&rsquo;t be applied selectively to delegitimize countries the US government opposes (Iran, Venezuela, Russia, China). Instead the whole array of political, social, and economic rights needs to be upheld everywhere.</p>\n<h1>A 2020 Platform</h1>\n<p>Here is a basic five-point foreign policy platform that a socialist candidate for president like Bernie Sanders, or indeed any politician who wants to present her or himself as progressive, should adopt.</p>\n<p>First, the greatest danger to the United States, and the main source of future refugees, is global warming. Thus, the primary goal of foreign policy should be to take every step possible to reduce CO2 emissions, and use this country&rsquo;s leverage from such reductions to negotiate treaties committing other countries to also take significant and verifiable measures.</p>\n<p>Second, since arms sales mainly serve to intensify wars, the United States should commit to ending the sales of weapons abroad. Again, the United States should use that commitment to negotiate treaties with the other major arms sellers (our allies like France, Britain, Germany and Israel, as well as Russia and China) to also stop sales.</p>\n<p>Third, the United States needs to wind down its empire of global military bases. Those bases, like arms sales, make wars more likely (with the exception of those in Western Europe), and in many countries they fortify authoritarian governments.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the American military budget should be cut so that it funds only a truly defensive armed force. Arms cuts, like those of CO2 and of arms sales, can be leveraged in negotiations to get other countries to also reduce their military budgets. This country did this before: President Nixon cut the military budget by over a third and that provided the basis for the series of arms control treaties that significantly reduced nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>Fifth, we need to learn the lesson of the 2008 financial crisis and negotiate limits on capitalists&rsquo; ability to move &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money around the globe and to hide money in tax havens. The United States has enormous leverage over banks throughout the world because it can threaten to exclude foreign banks from transactions with the United States. That is the power that underwrites the current embargoes against Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela.</p>\n<p>Instead, such sanctions should be used to cut off any country that does not make information about the true owners of accounts in those countries available to tax officials in their home countries. Thus, banks in tax shelters would need to let the IRS know about all accounts held by Americans in those places, and let the authorities of other countries know about their citizens&rsquo; accounts.</p>\n<aside>World affairs often are made to appear a stew of distinct and unrelated actors and events. In that imagined fog, capitalists and militarists who know what they want, and who know better than to separate domestic and foreign affairs, can overwhelm the rest of us.</aside>\n<p>These five principles can help develop rational and humane policies in the hotspots that are the focus of attention. They can guide immediate responses to the unpredictable foreign-policy tussles that occur in our twenty-four-hour-media cycle.</p>\n<p>Iran, for instance, is not a threat to the United States. If we want to reduce tension in the Middle East, the first step is to stop selling weapons to the antagonists of the region. We should immediately stop sales to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries which today are using American weapons to massacre civilians in Yemen, creating bitter enemies whose anger someday will blow back on the United States.</p>\n<p>For more than forty years the United States has used Israel as its enforcer in the Middle East. Israel, in return for arms and diplomatic support, has intimidated and waged war when necessary on Syria, Lebanon, Iran, and on leftists in Jordan and elsewhere while quietly assisting Egypt and Saudi Arabia in their repression of domestic opponents. US arms sales have served to embolden the most militaristic and intransigent elements in Israel, encouraging aggression rather than negotiation with Palestinians.</p>\n<p>The United States tips the scale in favor of the most reactionary elements within Israel and toward policies rejected by a majority of Jews in the United States and around the world. Sanders and other left politicians need to be clear that departing from the establishment policy on Israel is not antisemitic. Since the United States is the biggest supporter of Israel&rsquo;s policies, it is the United States and not Jewish people who are responsible for the oppression of Palestinians.</p>\n<p>Neither Iran nor Venezuela pose a threat to the United States. Their militaries are tiny in comparison to ours. The people of those countries should be able to decide on their own government without US interference. Nor should we encourage neighboring countries to attack. An Israeli attack on Iran or an invasion of Venezuela by any of its neighbors would lead to regional war and create massive numbers of refugees, further destabilizing those regions.</p>\n<p>Finally, we need to remember that Russia and China&rsquo;s military budgets are fractions of that of the United States. They do not pose a threat to this country. They too face budgetary pressures and would gain from new arms control treaties. We should engage their stated willingness to reduce tensions and to negotiate new treaties.</p>\n<p>Today, in the midst of vicious attacks on workers and the oppressed within the United States, it&rsquo;s tempting to focus our energies on domestic issues. With so few Americans dying in wars, and the toll the United States imposes internationally often going unseen, to many it feels like a side issue.</p>\n<p>However, our ability to challenge capitalists is weakened by their global reach, and resources needed for social programs and environmental transformation are wasted on weapons. These weapons then cause and intensify wars which, thanks to their nuclear capacity and environmental destruction, threaten to destroy us completely.</p>\n<p>Transformations within the United States and around the world will only happen if mass movements push them. A socialist domestic policy will be strengthened if it is combined with an effort to remake foreign policy as well. We also will have an easier time explaining the causes of our falling standard of living and of environmental disaster when we can place it in a global context.</p>\n<p>The great advantage we have as socialists is that we have a conceptual framework that can make clear the connections between domestic and foreign policy. World affairs often are made to appear a stew of distinct and unrelated actors and events. In that imagined fog, capitalists and militarists who know what they want, and who know better than to separate domestic and foreign affairs, can overwhelm the rest of us.</p>\n<p>The best way to challenge their power is to formulate clear demands and back them with sharp socialist analysis that make clear the choice between a world they continue to run and one that instead is shaped by the ideas and the common interests of the vast majority of people on this planet.</p>",

                "text": "Our hopes for a socialist United States are constrained as much by the material and human costs of the American empire as by the power capitalists wield domestically. If we want to build public support for socialism we must make foreign policy part of our analysis.\nWe need to be able to explain clearly why the United States is perpetually involved in hot and cold wars; and offer a clear pathway to a different foreign policy that serves the true interests of the vast majority of Americans and the desires of people around the world for freedom from war, environmental disaster, economic oppression, and political repression.\nThis country\u2019s military budget, trade agreements, foreign \u201caid,\u201d military alliances, and wars all are designed to further the interests of capitalists and of what C. Wright Mills called the military elite. We need to recognize that at times some capitalists are in conflict with others and that the military elite has its own interests that go beyond making the world safe for American capitalism. Those differences provide leverage for the rest of us to challenge existing foreign policy. However, our main strength comes from showing how most people are harmed rather than helped when the government serves narrow elite interests.\nEver since the 1930s the US government has pushed for trade agreements that give American companies access to foreign markets. At the same time, the United States has used military and non-military means to remove governments that tried to restrict capitalists\u2019 ability to exploit resources and workers in other countries or to create social protections for their citizens. Obviously, the United States is less able to intervene in other wealthy countries, like those of Western Europe, even as America\u2019s ability to mold other nations to its will has increased since the end of the Soviet Union.\nUS goals in trade treaties have changed over time. Up to the 1960s, the government pushed to open foreign markets to American manufactured goods. But as America\u2019s industrial edge disappeared, the United States instead has sought to win access for financial firms above all. It also aims to protect American pharmaceutical, software, and entertainment firms\u2019 patents and copyrights. In essence, since the 1970s, American trade negotiators have sacrificed industrial workers to protect the profits of Wall Street, Big Pharma, Silicon Valley, and Hollywood.\nOur foreign policy\u2019s primary goal should be to unite workers across borders to limit the power of capitalists.\nThe United States\u2019 trade strategies and interventionist tactics reflect the power that American capitalists as a class, and a shifting set of the most privileged corporations, exert over the US government. As socialists, we need to present this reality and refute the false claim that trade treaties are win-win outcomes for people throughout the world. Indeed, workers everywhere are harmed by the trade treaties their governments negotiate.\nWe need to note that American trade policies have been consistent over Democratic as well as Republican administrations. Claims that \u201cgold standard\u201d trade treaties protect workers or the environment were as false under Obama and Clinton as they are under Trump. Moreover, they harm workers in China as well as in the United States. The game Donald Trump claims to be playing, of extracting concessions from China that will benefit American workers, is as misleading as the promises that Obama and all his predecessors made about the benefits of their latest trade treaty.\nThe US military, like those of most countries, protects its nation\u2019s capitalist investments abroad. Howard Zinn, among many scholars, documented numerous instances of American invasions or intimidation to ensure that US corporations could keep the plantations, mines, factories, and other facilities they owned abroad. Sometimes, the United States intervenes to protect foreign capitalists\u2019 investments, as when the CIA overthrew the democratically elected government of Iran in 1953 after it nationalized British owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.\nAs the United States\u2019 edge over other military powers has widened, it rarely needs to actually send troops to overthrow governments. The mere fact of US military dominance serves to intimidate other governments and prevents other countries from challenging America\u2019s ability to set the terms of international trade and diplomacy.\nSuch power is enormously expensive to build and maintain. It requires a vast, permanent military establishment. Any organization, like the Pentagon, which commands millions of soldiers and other employees and controls a budget approaching $1 trillion a year, amasses great political power and autonomy as well \u2014 both abroad and within US institutions.\nThe US is unusual among nations in that from its beginning it relied upon private companies to develop and build weaponry. Weapons contracts generate greater profit margins than most other businesses, creating a unity of interests between military officers and capitalists, who otherwise oppose expensive government programs that ultimately must be funded through taxes.\nGenerals\u2019 views of how to fight wars and what weaponry they need are shaped, indeed determined, by the way their careers are structured. Officers spend their careers assigned to units that man and deploy specific weapons systems. They advance by commanding expensive and technically complex weapons. Winning appropriations for those weapons systems ensures long careers for the ever-expanding corps of generals. Budget cuts or more drastically the cancellation of a weapons system would stymie or end the careers of officers in that military division.\nWeapons systems also reward officers in their retirement. Defense firms often hire retired military officers, and the promise of high corporate salaries to supplement their pensions gives officers a powerful incentive not to question the worth of expensive weapons systems, or to dispute contractors\u2019 bills and pricing decisions.\nThese career and organizational imperatives mesh perfectly with defense firms\u2019 interest in selling advanced weapons systems, which consistently yield the largest profits. Thus, advanced weapons continue to absorb the lion\u2019s share of the Pentagon budget even though those weapons are fundamentally ill suited for the actual wars the United States fights in the twenty-first century.\nThe United States\u2019 overwhelming military power is complemented by a system of alliances spanning much of the globe. However, relations with other countries are increasingly managed by the military rather than the State Department. The Defense Department since World War II has cultivated direct ties with their military counterparts elsewhere in the world, as has the Central Intelligence Agency.\nIn addition, the military and CIA sustain independent relations with civilian officials of many foreign governments. The Pentagon has created \u201ccommands\u201d for each region of the world, headed by senior generals or admirals, who negotiate directly with both military and civilian officials in the countries of those regions about policy matters that extend far beyond military cooperation. These commands endure across presidential administrations and thus provide more continuity in US strategic policies and foreign relations than do the civilian side of the US government.\nTies between the United States and foreign militaries are further cemented through arms sales since purchasers remain dependent on the United States for training and intelligence. Arms sales abroad also bolster manufacturers\u2019 profits, providing a powerful incentive for American capitalists to support their government\u2019s ties to even the most brutal regimes in the world, as we see now with Saudi Arabia. In addition, a third of America\u2019s measly foreign aid budget, which comes to less than 1 percent of the total Federal budget, is devoted to subsidizing other countries\u2019 weapons purchases.\nThe Pentagon\u2019s common interests with capitalists, and its increasingly independent links to other governments, makes it difficult for civilian officials \u2014 including presidents \u2014 to challenge the military\u2019s war plans. The Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq wars continued for years after it became clear the commanding generals were delusional about the prospects for victory, and as the death toll of both US soldiers and civilians in the countries the United States had invaded mounted. The United States has almost eight hundred bases in more than seventy countries around the world. Those bases expose US troops stationed there to potential attacks, which then become justification for sending more troops and increasing \u201canti-terrorism\u201d spending. American soldiers offer \u201ctraining\u201d to foreign armies, and in so doing insert themselves into the politics and conflicts of the countries where they are based. Since World War II the United States has tried to overthrow governments in sixty countries, and succeeded in thirty-four of them.\nIt is not enough to say what is wrong with US military and foreign policy. We need to present a socialist alternative. Our foreign policy\u2019s primary goal should be to unite workers across borders to limit the power of capitalists. Capitalists gain a huge advantage from their ability to move money around the globe. The threat of a capital strike or of capital flight is used to break unions; force left governments to reduce social benefits; and cancel environmental, financial, and business regulation.\nThe United States clearly has the leverage to reverse pro-capitalist policies. After all it has used its power, as we noted above, to impose trade treaties and to intimidate or replace foreign governments. We need to demand that our government instead ally with left governments and popular forces around the world to enact very different sorts of treaties: ones that end money laundering and movements of \u201chot\u201d money by forcing banks around the world to identify the true owners of capital, tax treaties that impose uniform and highly progressive rates so that capitalists can\u2019t park money in tax shelters, and trade treaties that require exporting countries and firms to uphold living wages, strong health and safety regulations, and favor products made by unionized workers.\nBernie Sanders was correct when he said that climate change is the greatest national security threat faced by the United States; it is also the greatest threat facing humans the world over.\nAmerican efforts to limit fossil fuels were nonexistent before 2009; then uneven and pathetically weak under Obama. Now, Trump is actively fostering oil and coal production domestically and around the world.\nThe rich countries of the world, who in the centuries of fossil fuel use have emitted most of the CO2 in the atmosphere, need to immediately sign a treaty committing them to end fossil fuel use within a decade. The United States can use its economic and diplomatic power to pressure its fellow oil/coal producers and users to make this transition, with the threat that rich countries that continue to use fossil fuels will have their exports embargoed.\nAt the same time, foreign aid now needs to be focused on helping poor nations make a rapid transition to green energy and on conserving forests and wetlands. The United States needs to recognize that in its budget and encourage other rich countries to do the same.\nWars in their destruction of human life are immoral and almost always fought for evil reasons: to further capitalist exploitation, to allow militaries to self-aggrandize themselves and the politicians who fund them, and to allow powerful groups to dominate weaker ones. Because the United States has such an overwhelming edge in arms and technology, American disarmament can be leveraged to gain commitments by others to disarm. We need to demand that the US government immediately stop all arms sales, withdraw its soldiers from the vast archipelago of bases it holds around the world, and to stop any sort of military cooperation with repressive regimes.\nHuman rights can\u2019t be applied selectively to delegitimize countries the US government opposes (Iran, Venezuela, Russia, China). Instead the whole array of political, social, and economic rights needs to be upheld everywhere.\nA 2020 Platform\nHere is a basic five-point foreign policy platform that a socialist candidate for president like Bernie Sanders, or indeed any politician who wants to present her or himself as progressive, should adopt.\nFirst, the greatest danger to the United States, and the main source of future refugees, is global warming. Thus, the primary goal of foreign policy should be to take every step possible to reduce CO2 emissions, and use this country\u2019s leverage from such reductions to negotiate treaties committing other countries to also take significant and verifiable measures.\nSecond, since arms sales mainly serve to intensify wars, the United States should commit to ending the sales of weapons abroad. Again, the United States should use that commitment to negotiate treaties with the other major arms sellers (our allies like France, Britain, Germany and Israel, as well as Russia and China) to also stop sales.\nThird, the United States needs to wind down its empire of global military bases. Those bases, like arms sales, make wars more likely (with the exception of those in Western Europe), and in many countries they fortify authoritarian governments.\nFourth, the American military budget should be cut so that it funds only a truly defensive armed force. Arms cuts, like those of CO2 and of arms sales, can be leveraged in negotiations to get other countries to also reduce their military budgets. This country did this before: President Nixon cut the military budget by over a third and that provided the basis for the series of arms control treaties that significantly reduced nuclear weapons.\nFifth, we need to learn the lesson of the 2008 financial crisis and negotiate limits on capitalists\u2019 ability to move \u201chot\u201d money around the globe and to hide money in tax havens. The United States has enormous leverage over banks throughout the world because it can threaten to exclude foreign banks from transactions with the United States. That is the power that underwrites the current embargoes against Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela.\nInstead, such sanctions should be used to cut off any country that does not make information about the true owners of accounts in those countries available to tax officials in their home countries. Thus, banks in tax shelters would need to let the IRS know about all accounts held by Americans in those places, and let the authorities of other countries know about their citizens\u2019 accounts.\nWorld affairs often are made to appear a stew of distinct and unrelated actors and events. In that imagined fog, capitalists and militarists who know what they want, and who know better than to separate domestic and foreign affairs, can overwhelm the rest of us.\nThese five principles can help develop rational and humane policies in the hotspots that are the focus of attention. They can guide immediate responses to the unpredictable foreign-policy tussles that occur in our twenty-four-hour-media cycle.\nIran, for instance, is not a threat to the United States. If we want to reduce tension in the Middle East, the first step is to stop selling weapons to the antagonists of the region. We should immediately stop sales to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries which today are using American weapons to massacre civilians in Yemen, creating bitter enemies whose anger someday will blow back on the United States.\nFor more than forty years the United States has used Israel as its enforcer in the Middle East. Israel, in return for arms and diplomatic support, has intimidated and waged war when necessary on Syria, Lebanon, Iran, and on leftists in Jordan and elsewhere while quietly assisting Egypt and Saudi Arabia in their repression of domestic opponents. US arms sales have served to embolden the most militaristic and intransigent elements in Israel, encouraging aggression rather than negotiation with Palestinians.\nThe United States tips the scale in favor of the most reactionary elements within Israel and toward policies rejected by a majority of Jews in the United States and around the world. Sanders and other left politicians need to be clear that departing from the establishment policy on Israel is not antisemitic. Since the United States is the biggest supporter of Israel\u2019s policies, it is the United States and not Jewish people who are responsible for the oppression of Palestinians.\nNeither Iran nor Venezuela pose a threat to the United States. Their militaries are tiny in comparison to ours. The people of those countries should be able to decide on their own government without US interference. Nor should we encourage neighboring countries to attack. An Israeli attack on Iran or an invasion of Venezuela by any of its neighbors would lead to regional war and create massive numbers of refugees, further destabilizing those regions.\nFinally, we need to remember that Russia and China\u2019s military budgets are fractions of that of the United States. They do not pose a threat to this country. They too face budgetary pressures and would gain from new arms control treaties. We should engage their stated willingness to reduce tensions and to negotiate new treaties.\nToday, in the midst of vicious attacks on workers and the oppressed within the United States, it\u2019s tempting to focus our energies on domestic issues. With so few Americans dying in wars, and the toll the United States imposes internationally often going unseen, to many it feels like a side issue.\nHowever, our ability to challenge capitalists is weakened by their global reach, and resources needed for social programs and environmental transformation are wasted on weapons. These weapons then cause and intensify wars which, thanks to their nuclear capacity and environmental destruction, threaten to destroy us completely.\nTransformations within the United States and around the world will only happen if mass movements push them. A socialist domestic policy will be strengthened if it is combined with an effort to remake foreign policy as well. We also will have an easier time explaining the causes of our falling standard of living and of environmental disaster when we can place it in a global context.\nThe great advantage we have as socialists is that we have a conceptual framework that can make clear the connections between domestic and foreign policy. World affairs often are made to appear a stew of distinct and unrelated actors and events. In that imagined fog, capitalists and militarists who know what they want, and who know better than to separate domestic and foreign affairs, can overwhelm the rest of us.\nThe best way to challenge their power is to formulate clear demands and back them with sharp socialist analysis that make clear the choice between a world they continue to run and one that instead is shaped by the ideas and the common interests of the vast majority of people on this planet.",

Coming in the wake of the <em><a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/06/labors-choice-after-janus\">Janus</a></em><a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/06/labors-choice-after-janus\"> Supreme Court decision</a>, the decline in membership is not particularly surprising. But that decline in official union membership is happening at the same time as an uptick in on-the-job militancy.</p>\n<p>Before the strike numbers were released, Doug Henwood <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/01/union-density-united-states-2018-bls\">sorted</a> through some of the union membership numbers, noting that while the numbers were down, the decline isn&rsquo;t the bloodletting that many the mainstream commentators <a href=\"https://illinoisepi.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/ilepi-pmcr-after-janus-final.pdf\">predicted</a> in the wake of <em>Janus, </em>at least not yet. Though labor is starting from a weak position, the key measure of labors strength &mdash; strikes &mdash; is on the rebound in a major way.</p>\n<p>How the open-shop offensive is playing out is being shaped by different strategies within labor&rsquo;s leadership, and by the rising tide of labor militancy kicked off (and given another <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/02/west-virginia-teachers-political-strike-omnibus-bill-education-privatization\">recent boost</a>) by <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/03/west-virginia-teachers-strike-agreement-budget\">West Virginia educators</a>.</p>\n<p>While some locals have focused on member-to-member outreach and aggressive bargaining to show the value of union representation, others continue focusing on a service-based philosophy. Former SEIU Local 775 President David Rolf was <a href=\"https://www.labornotes.org/blogs/2018/10/labors-real-innovators-will-come-ranks-not-corporate-world\">infamous for this approach,</a> arguing labor had to embrace &ldquo;a specific strategy that delivers quantifiable benefits to a recipient through a uniquely differentiated product, service, or intervention that solves a problem or improves a situation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If unions can&rsquo;t deliver strong contracts and real benefits on the job, the right-wing pitch to &ldquo;give yourself a raise&rdquo; by quitting the union and saving on monthly dues offers a more immediate payoff. Reducing union membership to a transactional level of getting a good <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/the-state-worker/article220310445.html\">return on investment</a> undermines the larger solidaristic cause of labor that is so evident in the current strike wave.</p>\n<p>But this shouldn&rsquo;t be unexpected for anyone familiar with the labor movement for the last fifty years.

Decade after decade of stagnating or falling wages simply leaves the door open to the question &ldquo;why pay dues at all?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This is mirrored in the private sector, most dramatically illustrated by the recent <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/09/ups-teamsters-union-contract-hoffa\">Teamsters contract negotiations</a> with United Parcel Service (UPS).

Adding insult to injury, starting wages for the lowest paid at unionized UPS are now fully $2 less than <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/10/jeff-bezos-amazon-wage-union-sanders\">nonunion Amazon</a> &mdash; a calculated move by the retail behemoth to cut any unionization effort at off at the legs.</p>\n<p>On the more positive side of the equation for labor, the impressive numbers can&rsquo;t be separated from the character of the strikes. The most exciting of these recent strikes broke out of the narrow confines of tightly scripted actions and unleashed the creative energy of the rank and file. The strikes of 2018 included illegal strikes, rank-and-file-led strikes, and strikes of the unorganized (most notably <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html\">anti-sexual harassment walkouts</a> at Google).</p>\n<p>It is not surprising then, that locals that bargained strong contracts, and those that struck, held the line against <em>Janus </em>or grew. Membership actually <em>rose</em> by 2.2 percent in Red States that saw raucous strikes last year, where unionism came to mean participatory direct action.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles teachers&rsquo; strike was an offensive strike that brought <a href=\"https://socialistworker.org/2019/01/23/we-won-a-historic-victory-for-la-schools\">social justice issues</a> to the bargaining table that were not covered by their contract. Images of teachers, students, and parents <a href=\"https://socialistworker.org/2019/01/18/give-us-tacos-and-roses\">eating free tacos</a> and dancing in the streets flooded the news.

Hours before his inauguration, the first curious visitors were already wandering wide-eyed through a sumptuous series of rooms that, in symbolic terms, carried similar weight to the unveiling of <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/romania/bucharest/travel-tips-and-articles/the-ghosts-of-bucharests-past-a-tour-of-the-spring-palace/40625c8c-8a11-5710-a052-1479d276cec5\">Ceausescu&rsquo;s Spring Palace in Bucharest</a>. AMLO <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-j7koX9ws\">rode to the inauguration</a> from his private residence &mdash; where he continues to live &mdash; in the same simple Volkswagen Jetta subsequently used to usher around visiting heads of government <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlhYU0wNmE8\">such as Spain&rsquo;s Pedro S&aacute;nchez</a>. And with the windows down, he allowed a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7yLQ_K8upU\">cyclist to ride up and wish him well</a> with the words: &ldquo;<em>En ti confiamos</em>.&rdquo; We trust you.</p>\n<p>Once in office, the new president continued to dismantle the trappings of the imperial presidency, putting the opulent presidential plane &mdash; acquired for some $218 million dollars in 2012, just in time for the presidency of Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto &mdash; <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/04/world/mexico-presidential-plane-obrador-trnd/index.html\">up for sale</a>, together with sixty other governmental planes. AMLO, for his part, would fly coach. And whereas <em>Los Pinos</em> was opened on his first day, the president took advantage of his hundredth day to <a href=\"https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/amlo-conmemora-100-dias-de-gobierno-con-el-cierre-del-penal-en-islas-marias\">officially close the Islas Mar&iacute;as penitentiary</a>, the once-feared gulag of torture and torment that housed, among others, the <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/11/07/mexicos-marxist-prophet/\">Marxist writer Jos&eacute; Revueltas</a> (the novelist&rsquo;s time in the prison forms the basis of his 1941 novel <em>Los muros del agua </em>or &ldquo;Walls of Water&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>Whereas former presidents restricted press access to a combination of carefully scripted public events and fluffball interviews with friendly media, AMLO gives a morning press conference <em>every day </em>for upwards of two hours at a time. Far from saturating his image and subjecting him to debilitating attacks &mdash; the warnings of high-paid handlers the world over &mdash; the <em>ma&ntilde;aneras</em>, as they have come to be known, have set the agenda for both the nation&rsquo;s politics and its front pages. In a sign of the times, the archive of past conferences <a href=\"https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/mananeras-de-amlo-podran-escucharse-en-spotify\">is now available on Spotify</a>.</p>\n<p>AMLO&rsquo;s results in the policy terrain have, inevitably, been more nuanced than his masterful public image maneuvers. As promised with disciplined insistence during the campaign, AMLO wasted no time in attacking the kleptocratic state inherited from Pe&ntilde;a Nieto, lowering the <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/02/lopez-obrador-mexico-attacks-pan-right-wing\">bloated salaries of top bureaucracy</a>, reforming the <a href=\"https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/mexico/sociedad/amlo-acuerda-con-onu-transparencia-en-licitaciones-3056331.html\">bidding process for government tenders</a>, and launching a war on the <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/amlo-huachicoleros-cartel-gasoline-mexico-theft/\">multibillion-dollar industry of gasoline thievery</a> that literally fuels the nation&rsquo;s criminal economy. He&rsquo;s also quickly rolled out a series of social programs, including a modest <a href=\"https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/politica/lo-que-sabemos-de-las-pensiones-adultos-mayores-que-dara-amlo\">universal pension for over-68s</a> and <a href=\"https://expansion.mx/nacional/2019/01/11/un-millon-de-personas-con-discapacidad-recibiran-pension-de-1-274-pesos-al-mes\">those with disabilities</a>, a scholarship program to allow young people who are neither studying nor working (known in Mexico as &ldquo;<em>ninis</em>&ldquo;) <a href=\"http://www.unionguanajuato.mx/articulo/2019/01/11/educacion/becas-amlo-lineamientos-de-jovenes-construyendo-el-futuro\">to receive training and apprenticeships</a>, a system of <a href=\"https://www.nacion321.com/gobierno/como-hacer-que-el-gobierno-de-amlo-te-de-desde-6-mil-hasta-15-mil-pesos\">microcredits for areas of high marginalization</a>, and a <a href=\"https://politico.mx/minuta-politica/minuta-politica-gobierno-federal/amlo-inicia-federalizaci%C3%B3n-de-sistema-de-salud-de-qu%C3%A9-trata/\">centralization of the nation&rsquo;s scattershot health care system</a> with the promise of phasing in some form of universal coverage over two years.</p>\n<p>In other areas, presidential inaction has been enough to allow advances to be made. In mid-January, the &ldquo;20/32&rdquo; strike movement began spreading through the <em>Ciudad Industrial</em> maquiladora zone in the city of Matamoros, located directly across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas. The action was spurred by AMLO&rsquo;s doubling of the minimum wage in the border area, which activated a collective-contract clause requiring any wage increase to be reflected in the salaries of all workers, even those making more than the minimum.</p>\n<p>In response, workers demanded a 20 percent across-the-board raise and an annual $32,000-peso ($1,665 US) bonus. When their demands were refused, they took to the streets. &ldquo;While <a href=\"https://jorgecastaneda.org/notas/2019/01/18/abstencion-en-matamoros/\">some point out </a>that the AMLO administration&rsquo;s failure to strongly stand with the strikers calls into question his Fourth Transformation&rsquo;s reputation as a &lsquo;leftist&rsquo; movement,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://nacla.org/news/2019/03/01/labor-spring-mexico%E2%80%99s-maquilas\">writes NACLA&rsquo;s Daniel Blue Tyx</a>, &ldquo;the fact that the government didn&rsquo;t take the side of the companies, in fact, represents a significant change.&rdquo; In previous cases of labor unrest, companies would simply get the federal government to declare the strike illegal; that did not happen this time.</p>\n<p>Another example of active neutrality has come on the foreign-affairs front. By standing up to both the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/pompeo-urges-regional-bloc-to-support-venezuelas-guaido.html\">Trump administration</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-latam/maduro-isolated-as-latin-american-nations-back-venezuela-opposition-leader-idUSKCN1PI01J\">Lima Group</a> (of which Mexico is nominally a member) in refusing to recognize Juan Guaid&oacute; as the interim president of Venezuela&mdash; and further, by refusing to go along with the <a href=\"https://en.mercopress.com/2019/02/08/international-contact-group-on-venezuela-calls-for-fresh-transparent-presidential-elections\">International Contact Group&rsquo;s call for new elections</a> &mdash; AMLO has provided an important regional counterweight to right-wing governments such as Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. This has helped curb the momentum of the imperial rush to war, providing a breathing space for negotiations of a non-aligned nature to take place. While it would be silly to assert that Mexico alone could hold off a Bolton/Abrams-stoked invasion of the beleaguered Bolivarian republic, its reclaiming of the historical mantle of state sovereignty &mdash; a <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/2019/02/08/greg-grandin/whats-at-stake-in-venezuela\">long-standing tenet of Latin American jurisprudence</a> in its struggle against international interventionism &mdash; has a value that goes beyond the merely symbolic.</p>\n<p>Other aspects of AMLO&rsquo;s relationship with the US, however, have been less forthright. Since taking power, he has <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/12/amlo-asylum-seekers-migrants-borders\">accommodated</a> &mdash; to a fault &mdash; Trump&rsquo;s border policy, <a href=\"https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Mexico-AMLO-Pledges-Visa-Program-for-Central-Americans--20181019-0002.html\">seeking to provide visas and jobs</a> to Central Americans in an attempt to curb migration, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/03/12/us/politics/ap-us-mexico-asylum.html\">allowing asylum seekers to be returned to Mexico</a> while their cases are processed with only a mild statement of disagreement, and refusing to speak out against both the American president&rsquo;s inhumane policy of family separation and his repeated insistence on building a border wall. AMLO is clearly banking on behind-the-scenes persuasion standing a better chance of success than a high-profile, asymmetric war of words. But, although Trump has been unusually measured when referring to his Mexican counterpart, it is unclear what else Mexico is gaining by opting for the soft sell.</p>\n<p>While AMLO is going along and getting along with Trump&rsquo;s bellicose border policy, he is also proceeding with the militarization of the Mexican side of the border. At the end of February, the Morena-controlled <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/2019/02/28/guardia-nacional-san-lazaro-7518.html\">Congress approved</a> &mdash; and the <a href=\"https://www.animalpolitico.com/2019/03/aprueban-guardia-nacional-32-congresos/\">state legislatures quickly ratified</a> &mdash; a series of Constitutional reforms allowing for the creation of a <em>Guardia Nacional</em>, or National Guard. The combined civil-military force will be made up of members of the Federal, Military, and Naval Police under the joint command of the Defense and Public Safety Departments. While the guard is being built up, the armed forces proper will continue to participate in internal security measures <a href=\"https://www.animalpolitico.com/2019/02/ejercito-calles-cinco-anos-guardia-nacional/\">for a period of five more years</a>.</p>\n<p>AMLO is clearly in an unenviable position: with <a href=\"https://www.animalpolitico.com/2019/02/violencia-enero-record-homicidios-secuestros/\">violence unabating</a> and police across all levels <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/09/26/651708030/mexican-authorities-disarm-acapulco-police-amid-infiltration-concerns-by-drug-ga\">infiltrated by organized crime</a> in multiple regions, a hybrid force under (ostensibly) civilian command, with a firm end date for the armed forces to return to their barracks, represents a defensible compromise. That, however, is scant comfort to the victims of decades of <a href=\"https://www.animalpolitico.com/2018/11/fuerzas-armadas-violaciones-derechos/\">human-rights violations and extrajudicial killings</a> perpetrated by Mexico&rsquo;s armed forces. And in light of AMLO&rsquo;s handing over the construction, administration, and profits from the <a href=\"https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/english/amlo-mexican-army-build-santa-lucia-airport\">revamped airport in Santa Lucia to the army</a> &mdash; without tenders of any kind &mdash; the new president&rsquo;s relationship with the armed forces remains under necessary scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Under scrutiny, too, is AMLO&rsquo;s seminal infrastructure project for the south: the <a href=\"https://themazatlanpost.com/2018/10/14/amlo-promotes-yucatans-mayan-train-with-new-video/\"><em>tren maya</em></a>, or Mayan Train, a 1,500-kilometer railroad designed to ferry tourists around the archaeological sites spread across five southern states &mdash; Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucat&aacute;n, and Quintana Roo. Following a tokenist &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.theyucatantimes.com/2018/12/amlo-asks-mother-earths-permission-to-build-maya-train-project/\">asking permission of Mother Earth</a>&rdquo; &mdash; but without, yet, consultation with the region&rsquo;s indigenous groups &mdash; AMLO announced the project would proceed, <a href=\"https://www.animalpolitico.com/2018/11/construccion-tren-maya-fase-proyecto/\">pending</a> the necessary feasibility and environmental studies.</p>\n<p>In a sign of the kind of development the project is already attracting, <a href=\"https://www.traveltradecaribbean.es/es-oficial-hoteleras-espanolas-interesadas-en-el-tren-maya/\">Spanish hotel chains have declared their interest</a> in constructing a series of posh units along the line. In addition to sucking millions of gallons of water from the region&rsquo;s aquifers, these hotels will offer only precarious, low-paid service jobs while further threatening the cultural integrity of the region. Former <a href=\"http://www.sexenio.com.mx/aplicaciones/articulo/default.aspx?Id=271357\">indigenous presidential candidate Maria de Jes&uacute;s Patricio</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/2019/01/01/ezln-advierte-que-se-opondra-a-proyectos-de-amlo-9972.html\">the Zapatistas</a> have condemned what the latter have coined &ldquo;<em>el proyecto de muerte</em>&rdquo; &mdash; the death project. Others, like the nationally recognized Oaxacan artist and activist Francisco Toledo, have criticized the train as a <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/2019/02/06/cultura/a03n1cul\">potential ecological disaster</a>.</p>\n<p>In these and other projects, AMLO has displayed a frustrating social-democratic tendency to present himself as the farthest acceptable limit of progressive politics. This has manifested itself in <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/2019/02/27/201creproche-fraterno201d-de-amlo-a-opositores-de-la-termoelectrica-8129.html\">his habit</a> of labeling left-wing critics and activists who oppose his government&rsquo;s plans as &ldquo;conservatives.&rdquo; In the case of the thermoelectric power plant being built on the Huexca River in the State of Morelos, for instance &mdash; which <a href=\"https://www.elsoldecuernavaca.com.mx/local/no-queremos-esa-termoelectrica-amlo-en-2014-3017243.html\">AMLO opposed</a> before coming to support it once in power &mdash; the president levelled a &ldquo;fraternal reproach to organizations that present themselves as left or radical. For me that is conservatism. That is to maintain the status quo, to keep things the same.&rdquo; In another instance, <a href=\"https://www.animalpolitico.com/2019/02/amlo-termoelectrica-morelos-radicales-izquierda/\">in stronger terms, he stated</a>: &ldquo;Listen, left-wing radicals, who for me are no more than conservatives: if the Federal Electricity Commission&rsquo;s thermoelectric plant, which belongs to the nation, is not used, instead of having light for all of Morelos, we will have to continue to buy electricity from foreign companies; it&rsquo;s that simple.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The point is well-taken: of course it is better to produce electricity publicly &mdash; building up the nation&rsquo;s energy autonomy &mdash; than purchase it from subsidized private providers. But that begs the question: why not repeal the Energy Reform Law that opened the sector to those providers in the first place? Tragically, just days after AMLO railing against &ldquo;left-wing radicals,&rdquo; a longtime activist against the Huexca project, Samir Flores, <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/2019/02/21/matan-a-samir-flores-opositor-a-termoelectrica-en-morelos-6192.html\">was gunned down</a>. Even so, AMLO went ahead with another of his off-the-cuff <em>consultas</em>, or plebiscites, organized on the quick without the opposition having the time or resources to oppose the government&rsquo;s massive bully pulpit. The plant project won with 59 percent of votes cast, but rural and indigenous activists denounced it as a victory &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/2019/02/22/miles-marchan-en-la-cdmx-en-repudio-al-asesinato-de-samir-flores\"><em>manchada de sangre</em></a>&rdquo; &mdash; stained in blood. As AMLO should well know, there is more than one definition of &ldquo;<em>conservador</em>&rdquo;: it can also refer to those who conserve social and cultural practices and the natural world from destruction.</p>\n<p>On February 14, in another awkward miscommunication, a presidential order announced the <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/2019/02/23/reasignaran-recursos-para-refugios-de-victimas-de-violencia-extrema-6680.html\">cessation</a> of governmental subsidies to all social organizations, unions, civil, and citizen movements. At stake was $30 million pesos in direct government subsidies. In the neoliberal era, the leeching of core state functions to an unelected, unaccountable army of NGOS and &ldquo;civil society organizations&rdquo; has represented a deliberate strategy of undermining the state. In that context, AMLO&rsquo;s decree was clearly in the right. &ldquo;They created this idea of civil society, satanizing and stigmatizing the government. If the work is done by the government it won&rsquo;t be efficient and they&rsquo;ll rob it all, so better to give it to us [civil-society organizations],&rdquo; he <a href=\"https://lopezobrador.org.mx/2019/02/26/version-estenografica-de-la-conferencia-de-prensa-matutina-del-presidente-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-50/\">stated at a press conference</a>.</p>\n<p>What was intended as a strike against corruption and the outsourcing of the state, however, was quickly spun by media as an attack on the vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Included among organizations whose funding would be cut were refuges for women escaping violence. In a country where <a href=\"https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/politica/Cada-dia-nueve-mujeres-asesinadas-20190306-0127.html\">3,580 women were killed in 2018</a> and 66 percent of women have experienced some form of violence, it should have come as no surprise that a sudden funding cut would produce an angry reaction from a network of <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/2019/02/23/reasignaran-recursos-para-refugios-de-victimas-de-violencia-extrema-6680.html\">190 refuges across the country</a>. AMLO&rsquo;s own stumbles only exacerbated the issue. Rather than simply reassuring the public that crucial services such as shelters would be protected during the transition &mdash; as he did with the phasing out of the <em>Seguro Popular </em>health program &mdash; he made the insensitive suggestion that at-risk women should <a href=\"https://www.nacion321.com/gobierno/amlo-dejara-de-apoyar-a-las-mujeres-que-sufren-violencia\">receive money in a debit card</a>, as if that were a substitute for a safe place to go.</p>\n<p>A similar furor was sparked by AMLO&rsquo;s comments on childcare. For years, the government has outsourced day-care provision for both the IMSS health care system and a separate network of <em>estancias infantiles</em>, to a series of poorly regulated, private day-care centers financed by a <a href=\"https://www.animalpolitico.com/2019/02/estancias-infantiles-irregularidades-familias/\">ripe-for-corruption system</a> of per-child reimbursements. The results, in at least once instance, have been deadly: a 2009 fire at the ABC daycare facility in the City of Hermosillo killed 49 children between the ages of five months and five years, leaving 106 more injured. It <a href=\"https://www.animalpolitico.com/2014/09/la-causa-del-incendio-en-la-guarderia-abc-peritajes-testimonios-e-implicaciones-legales/\">was later determined</a> that the blaze was caused by the overheating of a power outlet, leading highly flammable substances in the paper warehouse where the facility was precariously located to catch fire.</p>\n<p>In this case, too, AMLO&rsquo;s government mooted the idea of ending subsidies to these facilities, opting instead to provide a monthly payment directly to parents. Such a voucher system, in the absence of universal day care, is likely to funnel the money back into the private sector. While these plans were later qualified both <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/2019/03/05/politica/003n1pol\">by AMLO</a> and his Secretary of Well-being, <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/2019/03/07/no-cierran-estancias-infantiles-albores-5683.html\">Maria Luisa Albores</a>, who promised that no refuges and day cares providing proper services would be closed, the damage had been done.</p>\n<p>These stumbles may be symptomatic of deeper issues at the heart of the <em>cuarta transformaci&oacute;n </em>&mdash; the fourth transformation which AMLO promises will revolutionize Mexican politics and society. AMLO&rsquo;s lofty rhetoric and frenetic activism &mdash; he repeatedly declares that he works <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/2019/03/11/politica/003n1pol\">&ldquo;sixteen hours a day for the people</a>,&rdquo; a claim few would doubt &mdash; allows it to seem, <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/2019/03/11/opinion/008o1pol\">as columnist Julio Hern&aacute;ndez L&oacute;pez suggests</a>, like big changes are in store even if, in the end, market forces will limit what his government can achieve.</p>\n<p>What Hern&aacute;ndez L&oacute;pez calls the &ldquo;invisible guillotine&rdquo; has already made itself felt in the new government&rsquo;s first one-hundred days: on January 29, the Wall Street ratings agency Fitch <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=2ahUKEwixr_y7uorhAhUSZawKHU8_Db4QFjABegQICBAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pemex.com%2Fen%2Finvestors%2Fdebt%2FCalificacin%2520crediticia%2FFitch%2520Downgrades%2520PEMEX%2527s%2520IDRs%2520to%2520%2527BBB-%2527%3B%2520Outlook%2520Negative.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0vYnmS62L0S_GFlp7ZZsUH\">downgraded the debt</a> on Mexico&rsquo;s national oil company, Pemex, to just above junk status. On March 2<sup>,</sup> <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/2019/03/02/economia/017n1eco\">Standard and Poor&rsquo;s (S&amp;P) announced</a> that AMLO&rsquo;s first ninety days had &ldquo;affected the confidence of investors&rdquo; and therefore justified the downgrading of Mexico&rsquo;s public debt from stable to negative. This, despite the fact the government&rsquo;s first budget largely remained within neoliberal strictures, moving money around without levying new taxes on the wealthy or corporations. The cravenness of the ratings agencies &mdash; they were willing to award positive evaluations to the Pe&ntilde;a Nieto government while collecting <a href=\"https://www.jornada.com.mx/2019/03/11/opinion/006o1eco\">approximately $1.3 million dollars in government contracts</a> &mdash; should surprise no one. What may surprise some is how quickly the coercive power of &ldquo;market forces&rdquo; has been unleashed on a government which, so far, has done little to disrupt their basic logic. But, as the cases of other left governments in Latin America have shown, making concessions to neoliberal capitalism is no guarantee that the invisible guillotine will not decapitate best-laid plans.</p>\n<p>The challenge for the Mexican left in the coming months will be to find a way of working both with and against AMLO&rsquo;s government. It must defend the government from the Right while simultaneously pushing it further when its reforms either do not go far enough or go too far in damaging indigenous rights and the environment. Although AMLO&rsquo;s party, <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/07/morena-mexico-obrador-df-nieto-pri-oaxaca\">Morena</a>, is politically uneven, it remains a diverse and <em>national</em> movement that has become a repository for decades of pent-up grievances, aspirations, and demands, often exceeding what its leadership is willing to offer. After a hundred days, some sections of the Left have already written off AMLO&rsquo;s government as hopelessly compromised. But maintaining the balance between solidarity and critique is crucial to standing with and alongside the millions who, in the face of fraud, violence, disappearances, and years of crushing inequality, have succeeded in bringing a new government to power.</p>",

                "text": "Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has coasted through the artificial, arbitrary and frequently anticlimactic hundred-day gate with the wind at his back: an 80 percent approval rating and the sense, like few presidents in modern Mexican memory, of reshaping the office in his image.\nAMLO, as he is known for short, has proven to be a consummate master of political imagery. Within minutes of assuming the presidency on December 1, 2018, he opened the lavish presidential residence Los Pinos to the public for the first time. Hours before his inauguration, the first curious visitors were already wandering wide-eyed through a sumptuous series of rooms that, in symbolic terms, carried similar weight to the unveiling of Ceausescu\u2019s Spring Palace in Bucharest. AMLO rode to the inauguration from his private residence \u2014 where he continues to live \u2014 in the same simple Volkswagen Jetta subsequently used to usher around visiting heads of government such as Spain\u2019s Pedro S\u00e1nchez. And with the windows down, he allowed a cyclist to ride up and wish him well with the words: \u201cEn ti confiamos.\u201d We trust you.\nOnce in office, the new president continued to dismantle the trappings of the imperial presidency, putting the opulent presidential plane \u2014 acquired for some $218 million dollars in 2012, just in time for the presidency of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u2014 up for sale, together with sixty other governmental planes. AMLO, for his part, would fly coach. And whereas Los Pinos was opened on his first day, the president took advantage of his hundredth day to officially close the Islas Mar\u00edas penitentiary, the once-feared gulag of torture and torment that housed, among others, the Marxist writer Jos\u00e9 Revueltas (the novelist\u2019s time in the prison forms the basis of his 1941 novel Los muros del agua or \u201cWalls of Water\u201d).\nWhereas former presidents restricted press access to a combination of carefully scripted public events and fluffball interviews with friendly media, AMLO gives a morning press conference every day for upwards of two hours at a time. Far from saturating his image and subjecting him to debilitating attacks \u2014 the warnings of high-paid handlers the world over \u2014 the ma\u00f1aneras, as they have come to be known, have set the agenda for both the nation\u2019s politics and its front pages. In a sign of the times, the archive of past conferences is now available on Spotify.\nAMLO\u2019s results in the policy terrain have, inevitably, been more nuanced than his masterful public image maneuvers. As promised with disciplined insistence during the campaign, AMLO wasted no time in attacking the kleptocratic state inherited from Pe\u00f1a Nieto, lowering the bloated salaries of top bureaucracy, reforming the bidding process for government tenders, and launching a war on the multibillion-dollar industry of gasoline thievery that literally fuels the nation\u2019s criminal economy. He\u2019s also quickly rolled out a series of social programs, including a modest universal pension for over-68s and those with disabilities, a scholarship program to allow young people who are neither studying nor working (known in Mexico as \u201cninis\u201c) to receive training and apprenticeships, a system of microcredits for areas of high marginalization, and a centralization of the nation\u2019s scattershot health care system with the promise of phasing in some form of universal coverage over two years.\nIn other areas, presidential inaction has been enough to allow advances to be made. In mid-January, the \u201c20/32\u201d strike movement began spreading through the Ciudad Industrial maquiladora zone in the city of Matamoros, located directly across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas. The action was spurred by AMLO\u2019s doubling of the minimum wage in the border area, which activated a collective-contract clause requiring any wage increase to be reflected in the salaries of all workers, even those making more than the minimum.\nIn response, workers demanded a 20 percent across-the-board raise and an annual $32,000-peso ($1,665 US) bonus. When their demands were refused, they took to the streets. \u201cWhile some point out that the AMLO administration\u2019s failure to strongly stand with the strikers calls into question his Fourth Transformation\u2019s reputation as a \u2018leftist\u2019 movement,\u201d writes NACLA\u2019s Daniel Blue Tyx, \u201cthe fact that the government didn\u2019t take the side of the companies, in fact, represents a significant change.\u201d In previous cases of labor unrest, companies would simply get the federal government to declare the strike illegal; that did not happen this time.\nAnother example of active neutrality has come on the foreign-affairs front. By standing up to both the Trump administration and the Lima Group (of which Mexico is nominally a member) in refusing to recognize Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the interim president of Venezuela\u2014 and further, by refusing to go along with the International Contact Group\u2019s call for new elections \u2014 AMLO has provided an important regional counterweight to right-wing governments such as Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. This has helped curb the momentum of the imperial rush to war, providing a breathing space for negotiations of a non-aligned nature to take place. While it would be silly to assert that Mexico alone could hold off a Bolton/Abrams-stoked invasion of the beleaguered Bolivarian republic, its reclaiming of the historical mantle of state sovereignty \u2014 a long-standing tenet of Latin American jurisprudence in its struggle against international interventionism \u2014 has a value that goes beyond the merely symbolic.\nOther aspects of AMLO\u2019s relationship with the US, however, have been less forthright. Since taking power, he has accommodated \u2014 to a fault \u2014 Trump\u2019s border policy, seeking to provide visas and jobs to Central Americans in an attempt to curb migration, allowing asylum seekers to be returned to Mexico while their cases are processed with only a mild statement of disagreement, and refusing to speak out against both the American president\u2019s inhumane policy of family separation and his repeated insistence on building a border wall. AMLO is clearly banking on behind-the-scenes persuasion standing a better chance of success than a high-profile, asymmetric war of words. But, although Trump has been unusually measured when referring to his Mexican counterpart, it is unclear what else Mexico is gaining by opting for the soft sell.\nWhile AMLO is going along and getting along with Trump\u2019s bellicose border policy, he is also proceeding with the militarization of the Mexican side of the border. At the end of February, the Morena-controlled Congress approved \u2014 and the state legislatures quickly ratified \u2014 a series of Constitutional reforms allowing for the creation of a Guardia Nacional, or National Guard. The combined civil-military force will be made up of members of the Federal, Military, and Naval Police under the joint command of the Defense and Public Safety Departments. While the guard is being built up, the armed forces proper will continue to participate in internal security measures for a period of five more years.\nAMLO is clearly in an unenviable position: with violence unabating and police across all levels infiltrated by organized crime in multiple regions, a hybrid force under (ostensibly) civilian command, with a firm end date for the armed forces to return to their barracks, represents a defensible compromise. That, however, is scant comfort to the victims of decades of human-rights violations and extrajudicial killings perpetrated by Mexico\u2019s armed forces. And in light of AMLO\u2019s handing over the construction, administration, and profits from the revamped airport in Santa Lucia to the army \u2014 without tenders of any kind \u2014 the new president\u2019s relationship with the armed forces remains under necessary scrutiny.\nUnder scrutiny, too, is AMLO\u2019s seminal infrastructure project for the south: the tren maya, or Mayan Train, a 1,500-kilometer railroad designed to ferry tourists around the archaeological sites spread across five southern states \u2014 Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucat\u00e1n, and Quintana Roo. Following a tokenist \u201casking permission of Mother Earth\u201d \u2014 but without, yet, consultation with the region\u2019s indigenous groups \u2014 AMLO announced the project would proceed, pending the necessary feasibility and environmental studies.\nIn a sign of the kind of development the project is already attracting, Spanish hotel chains have declared their interest in constructing a series of posh units along the line. In addition to sucking millions of gallons of water from the region\u2019s aquifers, these hotels will offer only precarious, low-paid service jobs while further threatening the cultural integrity of the region. Former indigenous presidential candidate Maria de Jes\u00fas Patricio as well as the Zapatistas have condemned what the latter have coined \u201cel proyecto de muerte\u201d \u2014 the death project. Others, like the nationally recognized Oaxacan artist and activist Francisco Toledo, have criticized the train as a potential ecological disaster.\nIn these and other projects, AMLO has displayed a frustrating social-democratic tendency to present himself as the farthest acceptable limit of progressive politics. This has manifested itself in his habit of labeling left-wing critics and activists who oppose his government\u2019s plans as \u201cconservatives.\u201d In the case of the thermoelectric power plant being built on the Huexca River in the State of Morelos, for instance \u2014 which AMLO opposed before coming to support it once in power \u2014 the president levelled a \u201cfraternal reproach to organizations that present themselves as left or radical. For me that is conservatism. That is to maintain the status quo, to keep things the same.\u201d In another instance, in stronger terms, he stated: \u201cListen, left-wing radicals, who for me are no more than conservatives: if the Federal Electricity Commission\u2019s thermoelectric plant, which belongs to the nation, is not used, instead of having light for all of Morelos, we will have to continue to buy electricity from foreign companies; it\u2019s that simple.\u201d\nThe point is well-taken: of course it is better to produce electricity publicly \u2014 building up the nation\u2019s energy autonomy \u2014 than purchase it from subsidized private providers. But that begs the question: why not repeal the Energy Reform Law that opened the sector to those providers in the first place? Tragically, just days after AMLO railing against \u201cleft-wing radicals,\u201d a longtime activist against the Huexca project, Samir Flores, was gunned down. Even so, AMLO went ahead with another of his off-the-cuff consultas, or plebiscites, organized on the quick without the opposition having the time or resources to oppose the government\u2019s massive bully pulpit. The plant project won with 59 percent of votes cast, but rural and indigenous activists denounced it as a victory \u201cmanchada de sangre\u201d \u2014 stained in blood. As AMLO should well know, there is more than one definition of \u201cconservador\u201d: it can also refer to those who conserve social and cultural practices and the natural world from destruction.\nOn February 14, in another awkward miscommunication, a presidential order announced the cessation of governmental subsidies to all social organizations, unions, civil, and citizen movements. At stake was $30 million pesos in direct government subsidies. In the neoliberal era, the leeching of core state functions to an unelected, unaccountable army of NGOS and \u201ccivil society organizations\u201d has represented a deliberate strategy of undermining the state. In that context, AMLO\u2019s decree was clearly in the right. \u201cThey created this idea of civil society, satanizing and stigmatizing the government. If the work is done by the government it won\u2019t be efficient and they\u2019ll rob it all, so better to give it to us [civil-society organizations],\u201d he stated at a press conference.\nWhat was intended as a strike against corruption and the outsourcing of the state, however, was quickly spun by media as an attack on the vulnerable.\nIncluded among organizations whose funding would be cut were refuges for women escaping violence. In a country where 3,580 women were killed in 2018 and 66 percent of women have experienced some form of violence, it should have come as no surprise that a sudden funding cut would produce an angry reaction from a network of 190 refuges across the country. AMLO\u2019s own stumbles only exacerbated the issue. Rather than simply reassuring the public that crucial services such as shelters would be protected during the transition \u2014 as he did with the phasing out of the Seguro Popular health program \u2014 he made the insensitive suggestion that at-risk women should receive money in a debit card, as if that were a substitute for a safe place to go.\nA similar furor was sparked by AMLO\u2019s comments on childcare. For years, the government has outsourced day-care provision for both the IMSS health care system and a separate network of estancias infantiles, to a series of poorly regulated, private day-care centers financed by a ripe-for-corruption system of per-child reimbursements. The results, in at least once instance, have been deadly: a 2009 fire at the ABC daycare facility in the City of Hermosillo killed 49 children between the ages of five months and five years, leaving 106 more injured. It was later determined that the blaze was caused by the overheating of a power outlet, leading highly flammable substances in the paper warehouse where the facility was precariously located to catch fire.\nIn this case, too, AMLO\u2019s government mooted the idea of ending subsidies to these facilities, opting instead to provide a monthly payment directly to parents. Such a voucher system, in the absence of universal day care, is likely to funnel the money back into the private sector. While these plans were later qualified both by AMLO and his Secretary of Well-being, Maria Luisa Albores, who promised that no refuges and day cares providing proper services would be closed, the damage had been done.\nThese stumbles may be symptomatic of deeper issues at the heart of the cuarta transformaci\u00f3n \u2014 the fourth transformation which AMLO promises will revolutionize Mexican politics and society. AMLO\u2019s lofty rhetoric and frenetic activism \u2014 he repeatedly declares that he works \u201csixteen hours a day for the people,\u201d a claim few would doubt \u2014 allows it to seem, as columnist Julio Hern\u00e1ndez L\u00f3pez suggests, like big changes are in store even if, in the end, market forces will limit what his government can achieve.\nWhat Hern\u00e1ndez L\u00f3pez calls the \u201cinvisible guillotine\u201d has already made itself felt in the new government\u2019s first one-hundred days: on January 29, the Wall Street ratings agency Fitch downgraded the debt on Mexico\u2019s national oil company, Pemex, to just above junk status. On March 2, Standard and Poor\u2019s (S&P) announced that AMLO\u2019s first ninety days had \u201caffected the confidence of investors\u201d and therefore justified the downgrading of Mexico\u2019s public debt from stable to negative. This, despite the fact the government\u2019s first budget largely remained within neoliberal strictures, moving money around without levying new taxes on the wealthy or corporations. The cravenness of the ratings agencies \u2014 they were willing to award positive evaluations to the Pe\u00f1a Nieto government while collecting approximately $1.3 million dollars in government contracts \u2014 should surprise no one. What may surprise some is how quickly the coercive power of \u201cmarket forces\u201d has been unleashed on a government which, so far, has done little to disrupt their basic logic. But, as the cases of other left governments in Latin America have shown, making concessions to neoliberal capitalism is no guarantee that the invisible guillotine will not decapitate best-laid plans.\nThe challenge for the Mexican left in the coming months will be to find a way of working both with and against AMLO\u2019s government. It must defend the government from the Right while simultaneously pushing it further when its reforms either do not go far enough or go too far in damaging indigenous rights and the environment. Although AMLO\u2019s party, Morena, is politically uneven, it remains a diverse and national movement that has become a repository for decades of pent-up grievances, aspirations, and demands, often exceeding what its leadership is willing to offer. After a hundred days, some sections of the Left have already written off AMLO\u2019s government as hopelessly compromised. But maintaining the balance between solidarity and critique is crucial to standing with and alongside the millions who, in the face of fraud, violence, disappearances, and years of crushing inequality, have succeeded in bringing a new government to power.",

But last Saturday&rsquo;s Education Town Hall, organized by Jackson Heights People for Public Schools, was special. In addition to panelists from Class Size Matters, NYC Opt Out, Network for Public Education, New York State Alliance for Bilingual Education, the Alliance for Quality Education (AQE), and New York State Allies for Public Education (NYSAPE) &mdash; as well as newly-elected State Senators (and longtime education activists) John Liu, Jessica Ramos and Robert Jackson &mdash; we were expecting to hear from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p>\n<p>Of course, everyone wanted to see the charismatic AOC in person and take a selfie with her, and why not?

But thanks to the longstanding bipartisan consensus in favor of hedge-fund driven education remedies like charter schools and testing, even the most progressive national politicians have been complicit with pernicious &ldquo;teacher accountability&rdquo; schemes. <a href=\"https://gadflyonthewallblog.com/2015/08/15/bernie-sanders-explains-puzzling-education-vote-its-because-accountability/\">Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren</a> both pushed to keep the annual standardized-testing mandate &mdash; beloved of education-reform types as a cudgel to use against &ldquo;low-performing&rdquo; public schools and teachers, as well as a reliable profit stream for the test-prep industry &mdash; in the 2015 renewal of ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act, the latest rebranding of No Child Left Behind).</p>\n<p>Would AOC similarly disappoint?</p>\n<p>Spoiler: She did not, at least not on Saturday. Instead, she came out firmly against the privatization agenda, and urged parents to organize to have the testing mandate removed from federal education policy. But more than that, she exhorted us to reject the menu of bad options and divisive fights served up by austerity conditions, and instead embrace &ldquo;a solution on the scale of the problem&rdquo; as well as the solidarity that such an approach requires.</p>\n<p>AOC nodded in agreement when Diane Ravitch, historian and author of <em>The Death and Life of the Great American School System</em>, criticized anti-democratic efforts to privatize public goods and encouraged parents to resist by refusing standardized testing for their children. When AOC had the floor, she made a strong call to &ldquo;turn the ship around&rdquo; on education policy. She talked about her own parents&rsquo; painful decision to leave their Bronx community for Westchester and better schools for their children and how, decades later, a similar set of &ldquo;perverse incentives&rdquo; led her cousins to enroll their kids in charter schools &ldquo;because the public schools in Hunt&rsquo;s Point didn&rsquo;t feel good enough&hellip;We should never feel that way. And the moment we start feeling that way is the moment we should start fighting to improve them. Not to reject them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>AOC described how Betsy DeVos and her band of privatization zealots in the the federal Education Department were actively deregulating education in the interests of charter school profiteers on Wall Street. &ldquo;What we need to do is realize the scale of the problem and organize our hearts out. Because it is not going to come from just one vote,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s not just going to come from the Congresswoman in New York&rsquo;s Fourteenth district. This needs to be a national movement. Where we realize our agency. And the good news is that it has already started.&rdquo; She connected the organizing reflected in the room to the ongoing wave of teachers&rsquo; strikes, most recently in West Virginia, Los Angeles and Oakland, in which opposition to austerity and privatization has taken center stage. &ldquo;We are seeing it all over the country,&rdquo; she emphasized.</p>\n<p>At times, the Town Hall was like a rally, full of inspiring calls to action. The audience cheered when panelists urged the state to honor its commitments to funding equity and to expand bilingual education. AQE&rsquo;s Maria Bautista called upon elected officials to &ldquo;cripple the white supremacy curriculum that we have in our schools,&rdquo; specifically by supporting legislation to mandate culturally responsive education and end racially discriminatory discipline practices. And when Leonie Haimson of Class Size Matters pointed out that <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s579\">a Senate bill</a> to fund smaller class sizes in high-poverty schools was in need of a House co-sponsor, AOC called out, &ldquo;Good to know!&rdquo; to satisfied laughter from the crowd.</p>\n<p>But during the Q&amp;A, tensions emerged. The moderator, summarizing a number of written questions submitted by index card, relayed one from a student at one of New York City&rsquo;s selective specialized high schools, concerned that it was dominated by &ldquo;privileged, tutored&rdquo; students and in no way representative of the neighborhood. But another question characterized admissions test for such schools as an &ldquo;objective&rdquo; and &ldquo;ethnically blind&rdquo; way to &ldquo;level the playing field&rdquo; for applicants.</p>\n<p>Until this point, the panelists hadn&rsquo;t discussed the specialized high schools, New York City&rsquo;s renowned public exam schools, which have in recent years come under justified attack for enrolling few black or Latino students. (Two days after the town hall, public schoolchildren around the city learned which high schools they had gotten into: only seven black kids were among the nearly 900 who got into Stuyvesant, the most selective of the specialized high schools.) Various approaches to reform have been floated, but Mayor de Blasio&rsquo;s proposal to eliminate the entrance test has been particularly unpopular among Asian-Americans in Queens, where many feel that such a scheme discriminates against Asian students. As this last question was read, and as State Senator Jessica Ramos responded, about a dozen Asian parents, holding signs protesting de Blasio&rsquo;s plan as &ldquo;progressive racism&rdquo; against Asian children, stood to shout down the speakers.</p>\n<p>Perhaps surprisingly, AOC asked to take the mic on this question as well. Congress has no authority over New York City&rsquo;s specialized high schools, which in any case enroll a tiny fraction of NYC&rsquo;s public schoolchildren, and this messy fight seemed an unnecessary one for her to wade into. But her intervention was both politically masterful and startlingly on point. &ldquo;I also want to acknowledge the parents in the back of the room,&rdquo; she said, referring to the hecklers. Her father, growing up as one of five people in a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx, had attended Brooklyn Tech, one of the specialized schools. He woke up at 5am each morning to ride the subway there because, she explained, going to such a selective school was &ldquo;seen as the only way to have a dignified life.&rdquo; She explained that despite this exhausting routine, her father &ldquo;loved his experience at Brooklyn Tech, because he went to a good school.&rdquo; And here, she deftly reframed the whole debate, &ldquo;My question is, why isn&rsquo;t every public school in NYC a Brooklyn Tech-caliber school? Every one should be.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Rather than accepting the conditions of austerity and scrounging over crumbs, AOC urged people to embrace solidarity, think bigger and fight the ruling class. &ldquo;My concern is that this right here&rdquo; &mdash; she gestured to the protesters and to herself &mdash; &ldquo;when we are fighting each other, is exactly what happens under a scarcity mindset. Because this should not be the fight. This&rdquo; &mdash; she gestured around the room in a round, inclusive motion, then pointed upwards &mdash; &ldquo;should be the fight. We are in this together.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Some education activists were dismayed that AOC didn&rsquo;t take a position on the specialized high school exam. But in a way, her point on that issue &mdash; that the division among parents was distracting us from advocating for good schools for all of our children &mdash; was more trenchant than any specific solution she could have supported.</p>\n<p>In response to a question about how to get standardized testing requirements out of ESSA, she answered &ldquo;as an organizer,&rdquo; urging those present to bring their advocacy to DC and pointing out that grass-roots activists are the reason her Green New Deal has so much momentum in Congress. Speaking of her colleagues she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that they find me persuasive, they find you persuasive!&rdquo; She also implied that the hostile environment on education issues could be changing in Congress, just as it has been in New York State, noting that &ldquo;we have over thirty new members that don&rsquo;t take any corporate PAC money. So that in itself is a huge, heavy lift that we have already accomplished.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Independence from such interests, Ocasio-Cortez ventured, could reshape education politics. &ldquo;Because those members don&rsquo;t have to respond to corporate PACs they are much more responsive to the public on these issues.&rdquo; She also pointed out that a number of public school teachers had been elected to Congress during the midterms.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;a lot of this is about bringing it.&rdquo;</p>",

And the good news is that it has already started.\u201d She connected the organizing reflected in the room to the ongoing wave of teachers\u2019 strikes, most recently in West Virginia, Los Angeles and Oakland, in which opposition to austerity and privatization has taken center stage. \u201cWe are seeing it all over the country,\u201d she emphasized.\nAt times, the Town Hall was like a rally, full of inspiring calls to action. The audience cheered when panelists urged the state to honor its commitments to funding equity and to expand bilingual education. AQE\u2019s Maria Bautista called upon elected officials to \u201ccripple the white supremacy curriculum that we have in our schools,\u201d specifically by supporting legislation to mandate culturally responsive education and end racially discriminatory discipline practices. And when Leonie Haimson of Class Size Matters pointed out that a Senate bill to fund smaller class sizes in high-poverty schools was in need of a House co-sponsor, AOC called out, \u201cGood to know!\u201d to satisfied laughter from the crowd.\nBut during the Q&A, tensions emerged. The moderator, summarizing a number of written questions submitted by index card, relayed one from a student at one of New York City\u2019s selective specialized high schools, concerned that it was dominated by \u201cprivileged, tutored\u201d students and in no way representative of the neighborhood. But another question characterized admissions test for such schools as an \u201cobjective\u201d and \u201cethnically blind\u201d way to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for applicants.\nUntil this point, the panelists hadn\u2019t discussed the specialized high schools, New York City\u2019s renowned public exam schools, which have in recent years come under justified attack for enrolling few black or Latino students. (Two days after the town hall, public schoolchildren around the city learned which high schools they had gotten into: only seven black kids were among the nearly 900 who got into Stuyvesant, the most selective of the specialized high schools.) Various approaches to reform have been floated, but Mayor de Blasio\u2019s proposal to eliminate the entrance test has been particularly unpopular among Asian-Americans in Queens, where many feel that such a scheme discriminates against Asian students. As this last question was read, and as State Senator Jessica Ramos responded, about a dozen Asian parents, holding signs protesting de Blasio\u2019s plan as \u201cprogressive racism\u201d against Asian children, stood to shout down the speakers.\nPerhaps surprisingly, AOC asked to take the mic on this question as well. Congress has no authority over New York City\u2019s specialized high schools, which in any case enroll a tiny fraction of NYC\u2019s public schoolchildren, and this messy fight seemed an unnecessary one for her to wade into. But her intervention was both politically masterful and startlingly on point. \u201cI also want to acknowledge the parents in the back of the room,\u201d she said, referring to the hecklers. Her father, growing up as one of five people in a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx, had attended Brooklyn Tech, one of the specialized schools. He woke up at 5am each morning to ride the subway there because, she explained, going to such a selective school was \u201cseen as the only way to have a dignified life.\u201d She explained that despite this exhausting routine, her father \u201cloved his experience at Brooklyn Tech, because he went to a good school.\u201d And here, she deftly reframed the whole debate, \u201cMy question is, why isn\u2019t every public school in NYC a Brooklyn Tech-caliber school? Every one should be.\u201d\nRather than accepting the conditions of austerity and scrounging over crumbs, AOC urged people to embrace solidarity, think bigger and fight the ruling class. \u201cMy concern is that this right here\u201d \u2014 she gestured to the protesters and to herself \u2014 \u201cwhen we are fighting each other, is exactly what happens under a scarcity mindset. Because this should not be the fight. This\u201d \u2014 she gestured around the room in a round, inclusive motion, then pointed upwards \u2014 \u201cshould be the fight. We are in this together.\u201d\nSome education activists were dismayed that AOC didn\u2019t take a position on the specialized high school exam. But in a way, her point on that issue \u2014 that the division among parents was distracting us from advocating for good schools for all of our children \u2014 was more trenchant than any specific solution she could have supported.\nIn response to a question about how to get standardized testing requirements out of ESSA, she answered \u201cas an organizer,\u201d urging those present to bring their advocacy to DC and pointing out that grass-roots activists are the reason her Green New Deal has so much momentum in Congress. Speaking of her colleagues she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that they find me persuasive, they find you persuasive!\u201d She also implied that the hostile environment on education issues could be changing in Congress, just as it has been in New York State, noting that \u201cwe have over thirty new members that don\u2019t take any corporate PAC money. So that in itself is a huge, heavy lift that we have already accomplished.\u201d\nIndependence from such interests, Ocasio-Cortez ventured, could reshape education politics. \u201cBecause those members don\u2019t have to respond to corporate PACs they are much more responsive to the public on these issues.\u201d She also pointed out that a number of public school teachers had been elected to Congress during the midterms.\n\u201cSo,\u201d she observed, \u201ca lot of this is about bringing it.\u201d",

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p> </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Why exactly does anyone want <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/12/beto-orourke-president-2020-senate-race\">Beto O&rsquo;Rourke</a> to run for president?</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not because of his legislative record, which is <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/02/ted-cruz-beto-orourke-congressional-accomplishments-texas/\">quite limited</a>. Throughout six years in the House of Representatives, he <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/12/what-does-beto-orourke-actually-stand-for\">passed three bills</a> &mdash; two related to veterans affairs, one to renaming a federal building and courthouse.</p>\n<p>Nor does it seem to have much to do with any particular agenda he&rsquo;s hoping to implement. Despite taking the odd progressive position here and there, O&rsquo;Rourke is <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/12/what-does-beto-orourke-actually-stand-for\">assiduously vague and slippery on policy specifics</a>. As the <em>Washington Post</em>&rsquo;s Jenna Johnson <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/beto-orourkes-immigration-plan-no-wall-but-no-specifics/2019/01/15/f6e36fac-15ea-11e9-90a8-136fa44b80ba_story.html?fbclid=IwAR20XafFoPELP0zEtd5b4zoWBXj-wytqdlt_2RJ4LD2fuG2EeSONV2n4nDE&noredirect=on&utm_term=.f4680421fb4c\">observed a few months ago</a>: &ldquo;When it comes to many of the biggest policy issues facing the country today, O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s default stance is to call for a debate&rdquo; &mdash; even when it comes to areas he himself is fond of emphasizing, such as border policy and immigration.</p>\n<p>Nor is it because he espouses any particular set of beliefs that reflect a discernible popular or ideological constituency. In fact, O&rsquo;Rourke explicitly rejects labels. Apart from assuring everyone he&rsquo;s not a socialist (no surprise there), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VanityFair/status/1105939339622649858\">he says</a> he&rsquo;ll &ldquo;leave it to other people&rdquo; to characterize his political identity &mdash; refusing even to embrace the (already quite vague) descriptor &ldquo;progressive.&rdquo; &ldquo;In Texas, Ted Cruz called me a socialist. I&rsquo;m too liberal for Texas,&rdquo; he said during a recent visit to Wisconsin. &ldquo;Outside of Texas, people say, &lsquo;Is he really a Democrat? I think he&rsquo;s a closet Republican.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know where I am on a spectrum, and I almost could care less. I just want to get to better things for this country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A politician who wants things to get better. At long last.</p>\n<p>Given his general lack of legislative achievement, policy commitments, or distinct ideological edges of any kind, how exactly do we account for the Beto delirium that&rsquo;s swept through certain quarters of the media and Democratic Party elite over the past few months (as well as the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/18/beto-orourke-2020-6-million-dollars-1224704\">$6.1 million</a> his campaign reportedly raised in its first twenty-four hours)? More than a few <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/12/what-does-beto-orourke-actually-stand-for\">quite influential figures</a> have pitched O&rsquo;Rourke as a uniquely gifted politician, perfectly in sync with the times and primed to assume the mantle of political destiny.</p>\n<p><em>Pod Save America</em>&rsquo;s Dan Pfeiffer, for example, <a href=\"https://crooked.com/articles/beto-president-2020/\">wrote last November</a> that he&rsquo;d &ldquo;never seen a Senate candidate &mdash; including Obama in 2004 &mdash; inspire the sort of enthusiasm Beto did in this race,&rdquo; concluding: &ldquo;Millions of people already believe in Beto O&rsquo;Rourke, and that moment, for them and him, may be upon us.&rdquo; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s game changing,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/12/poll-biden-bernie-beto-lead-2020-dems-983995\">said</a><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/12/poll-biden-bernie-beto-lead-2020-dems-983995\"> Robert Wolf</a>, a past executive at the UBS investment bank who also happens to be a Democratic mega-donor. Such hyperbole (and much more in the same vein) aside, Beto-mania may have reached its zenith with last week&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/how-to-write-a-political-puff-piece?fbclid=IwAR2kKUVYiW6LToZXI78vUn8snY3kZ5uXUf2ueN8-cx5xujdcP9tXsDNOnSM\">fluffy</a>, 8,500 word <em>Vanity Fair </em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-orourke-cover-story\">profile</a> &mdash; with a cover photo shot by Annie Leibovitz and timed perfectly for O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s official campaign announcement.</p>\n<p>Despite its considerable length and tone of breathless enthusiasm, we learn very little about what O&rsquo;Rourke really believes or what, if anything, he would specifically seek to do as president. Indeed, it&rsquo;s many thousands of words before we finally arrive at anything approaching a coherent political belief:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t get turned on by being against &hellip;. I really get excited to be for. That&rsquo;s what moves me. It&rsquo;s important to defeat Trump, but that&rsquo;s not exciting to me &hellip;. What&rsquo;s exciting to me is figuring out something that has eluded us for so long: How do we make sure every single person can see a doctor in this country?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>We&rsquo;re informed, in addition to this, that O&rsquo;Rourke wants to &ldquo;shore up the Affordable Care Act and make Medicare part of the health-care marketplace,&rdquo; eventually making &ldquo;health care for all a reality&rdquo; (in the days since the profile was published, he has <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mollyhensleyclancy/beto-orourke-says-his-goal-for-health-care-is-not\">already rejected an actual single-payer model</a>). We also learn that he supports the <em>idea </em>of higher incomes tax for the wealthy (refusing to offer any kind of number, where <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/01/ocasio-cortez-70-percent-tax-redistribution-wealth\">others</a> <a href=\"http://tennesseestar.com/2019/01/31/ilhan-omar-floats-90-percent-tax-rate-on-americas-wealthiest/\">have</a>), and that he thinks the <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/02/green-new-deal-climate-change-policy\">Green New Deal</a> is a totally rad idea &mdash; at least &ldquo;in spirit.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we do learn a great deal about such things as O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s impressive shelf of presidential biographies (&ldquo;arranged in historical order [thus suggesting] there&rsquo;s been some reflection on the gravity of the presidency &hellip;&rdquo;), his fondness for rock memoirs, and his partiality to recordings by Nina Simone and The Clash. Quite a few adjectives are offered to describe O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s personal qualities, but these, too, come with a crippling lack of specificity. We learn, for example, that he has a knack for seeming &ldquo;free of political calculation, as if his charisma were a mere side effect of Beto just being Beto&rdquo; &mdash; the evidence for this being that O&rsquo;Rourke was seen air-drumming to The Who&rsquo;s &ldquo;Baba O&rsquo;Reilly&rdquo; while &ldquo;waiting for burgers at a drive-through the night he debated Ted Cruz at Southern Methodist University.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Indeed, much of the piece&rsquo;s portrait of O&rsquo;Rourke (both as a person and a politician) hinges on derivative cultural signifiers that tell us just as little as the candidate&rsquo;s laboriously vague statements on health care and border policy; for example: &ldquo;Beto O&rsquo;Rourke is quintessentially Generation X, weaned on Star Wars and punk rock and priding himself on authenticity over showmanship and a healthy skepticism of the mainstream.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If Authenticity&trade; and Charisma&trade; are supposed to be the cruxes of O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s personal style, we also learn that his message is one of &ldquo;honesty&rdquo; &mdash; though what exactly he intends to be honest <em>about</em> is apparently none of our business, his own declarations on the matter being positively postmodern in their indeterminacy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If I bring something to this &hellip;. I think it is my ability to listen to people, to help bring people together to do something that is thought to be impossible &hellip;. I may have an ability to work with people who think differently than I do, come to a different conclusion that I&rsquo;ve come to on a given issue, and yet find enough common ground to do something better than what we have right now.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>(Lofty proclamation tempered with post-partisan platitude seems to be a hallmark flourish of O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s rhetorical style, as when he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/betoorourke/status/1028635939852234755?lang=en\">declared during his Senate campaign</a>: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not running against anyone, any party, or anything. We&rsquo;re running for Texas, for this country, for the big, bold, ambitious work we want to accomplish together.&rdquo;)</p>\n<p>From start to finish, with several able assists from O&rsquo;Rourke himself, the <em>Vanity Fair</em> story reads more like a piece of political fan fiction than a serious (let alone even slightly critical) profile of someone who wants to be president with any specific purpose in mind, right down to its cringeworthy final sentences:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The more he talks, the more he likes the sound of what he&rsquo;s saying. &lsquo;I want to be in it,&rsquo; he says, now leaning forward. &lsquo;Man, I&rsquo;m just born to be in it, and want to do everything I humanly can for this country at this moment.&rsquo; A month later, Beto O&rsquo;Rourke announces his run for the White House.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>To return to the initial question then: why exactly do so many influential liberals believe Beto O&rsquo;Rourke 2020 is a good idea?</p>\n<p>A partial answer is that O&rsquo;Rourke reflects more or less the only presidential archetype Democrats have been able or willing to conjure since the Clintonite turn in the 1990s. Though material conditions for vast parts of their electoral base have continued to deteriorate, and though the country&rsquo;s politics has in many respects continued to move rightward, personally charismatic Democrats with decidedly centrist politics have won the White House four times since 1992.</p>\n<p>Back in 2008, Barack Obama &mdash; by most measures, a far more talented politician than either Clinton or O&rsquo;Rourke &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/2007/02/obama_is_the_best_bs_artist_since_bill_clinton/\">ran and won as a kind of universal political cipher</a>, rhetorically attacking special interests while also praising Ronald Reagan and pitching himself to the middle of the middle. He stood for everything and anything, and therefore nothing in particular &mdash; nothing, at least, that wasn&rsquo;t already mostly acceptable to Washington&rsquo;s conservative-minded policy consensus. Obama himself was quite conscious of it: &ldquo;I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views,&rdquo; he wrote in <em>The Audacity of Hope</em>.</p>\n<p>That, of course, is the real rub with <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/01/howard-schultz-billionaire-starbucks-president-2020\">candidates</a> who say they&rsquo;re neither left nor right, or those who gesture vaguely towards both: without a discernible program, set of values, or a clearly defined ideology, political leadership tends to default to whatever context it&rsquo;s situated in. When that&rsquo;s an atrophied Washington establishment, flooded with big donors, lobbyists, and hack politicians, we can usually expect some aggregate of the interests of all three to be what passes for progress, especially when the occupant of the Oval Office eschews the language of contestation in favor of hollow liturgies about bringing people (read: Beltway interest groups) &ldquo;together.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lacking Obama&rsquo;s compelling personal story and Clinton&rsquo;s skillfully contrived folksiness, O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s general pitch nevertheless has much in common with the one championed by the previous two Democratic presidents.</p>\n<p>If some elite <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/12/liberalism-theory-practice-obama-trudeau\">liberals</a> are trying to get the rest of us excited by O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s candidacy, then, one reason is that it conforms so closely to the mold of politics with which they&rsquo;re most familiar and comfortable &mdash; a politics which is avowedly about very little <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/the-obama-boys\">but nevertheless inspires tremendous fervor</a> among the devoted.</p>\n<p>He is ideologically vague and deliberately so. He is politically ambidextrous, talking endlessly about the need for debate, compromise, bipartisanship, and reaching across the aisle. He combines high-minded sentiments about historical destiny with ethereal notions about hearing from all sides and taking seriously all points of view.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke is therefore as much a brand and a product as he is a prospective national leader: an unfolding cultural narrative in which to become emotionally invested for mostly apolitical reasons, like the question of which team will win the Super Bowl or who will finally sit on the Iron Throne at the end of season eight. Fronting for an all-too-conventional style of Beltway politics, his personality is a tabula rasa upon which sundry groups in the Democratic coalition are invited to inscribe most anything they please and see themselves reflected. If we are to go by <em>Vanity Fair</em>&rsquo;s account, his cultural tastes usefully align with those of several key demographics and are squeaky clean with just a wee bit of #Edge. Most important of all, he is adept at seeming to say a whole lot while actually saying very little, trading in substance-free feel-goodisms with the smarmy bravado of an over-caffeinated self-help guru or door-to-door salesman &mdash; a quality admired above all others in the gilded, marketing-obsessed environment of Washington D.C.</p>\n<p>When politics has been stripped of program or ideological commitment &mdash; as it increasingly has been for many elite Democrats &mdash; all that is left is to recast the whole enterprise as a grand exercise in fan fiction: one that devotes tremendous energy to crafting a series of catch-all personalities who audition to play protagonists in the nation&rsquo;s collective psyche. While meeting with students at the University of Texas at El Paso last year, O&rsquo;Rourke himself in fact <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/beto-orourke-cover-story?verso=true\">compared</a> the battle against Trump to &ldquo;every epic movie that you&rsquo;ve ever seen, from <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For a privileged few, the 2020 presidential election may be just this: a notional spectacle whose stakes are so low that they can be communicated through appeals to mass-market fantasy. For the majority of Americans, though, the stakes are all too high, and there&rsquo;s precious little time for another round of fan fiction.</p>",

                "text": "Why exactly does anyone want Beto O\u2019Rourke to run for president?\nIt\u2019s certainly not because of his legislative record, which is quite limited. Throughout six years in the House of Representatives, he passed three bills \u2014 two related to veterans affairs, one to renaming a federal building and courthouse.\nNor does it seem to have much to do with any particular agenda he\u2019s hoping to implement. Despite taking the odd progressive position here and there, O\u2019Rourke is assiduously vague and slippery on policy specifics. As the Washington Post\u2019s Jenna Johnson observed a few months ago: \u201cWhen it comes to many of the biggest policy issues facing the country today, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s default stance is to call for a debate\u201d \u2014 even when it comes to areas he himself is fond of emphasizing, such as border policy and immigration.\nNor is it because he espouses any particular set of beliefs that reflect a discernible popular or ideological constituency. In fact, O\u2019Rourke explicitly rejects labels. Apart from assuring everyone he\u2019s not a socialist (no surprise there), he says he\u2019ll \u201cleave it to other people\u201d to characterize his political identity \u2014 refusing even to embrace the (already quite vague) descriptor \u201cprogressive.\u201d \u201cIn Texas, Ted Cruz called me a socialist. I\u2019m too liberal for Texas,\u201d he said during a recent visit to Wisconsin. \u201cOutside of Texas, people say, \u2018Is he really a Democrat? I think he\u2019s a closet Republican.\u2019 I don\u2019t know where I am on a spectrum, and I almost could care less. I just want to get to better things for this country.\u201d\nA politician who wants things to get better. At long last.\nGiven his general lack of legislative achievement, policy commitments, or distinct ideological edges of any kind, how exactly do we account for the Beto delirium that\u2019s swept through certain quarters of the media and Democratic Party elite over the past few months (as well as the $6.1 million his campaign reportedly raised in its first twenty-four hours)? More than a few quite influential figures have pitched O\u2019Rourke as a uniquely gifted politician, perfectly in sync with the times and primed to assume the mantle of political destiny.\nPod Save America\u2019s Dan Pfeiffer, for example, wrote last November that he\u2019d \u201cnever seen a Senate candidate \u2014 including Obama in 2004 \u2014 inspire the sort of enthusiasm Beto did in this race,\u201d concluding: \u201cMillions of people already believe in Beto O\u2019Rourke, and that moment, for them and him, may be upon us.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s game changing,\u201d said Robert Wolf, a past executive at the UBS investment bank who also happens to be a Democratic mega-donor. Such hyperbole (and much more in the same vein) aside, Beto-mania may have reached its zenith with last week\u2019s fluffy, 8,500 word Vanity Fair profile \u2014 with a cover photo shot by Annie Leibovitz and timed perfectly for O\u2019Rourke\u2019s official campaign announcement.\nDespite its considerable length and tone of breathless enthusiasm, we learn very little about what O\u2019Rourke really believes or what, if anything, he would specifically seek to do as president. Indeed, it\u2019s many thousands of words before we finally arrive at anything approaching a coherent political belief:\n\u201cI just don\u2019t get turned on by being against \u2026. I really get excited to be for. That\u2019s what moves me. It\u2019s important to defeat Trump, but that\u2019s not exciting to me \u2026. What\u2019s exciting to me is figuring out something that has eluded us for so long: How do we make sure every single person can see a doctor in this country?\u201d\nWe\u2019re informed, in addition to this, that O\u2019Rourke wants to \u201cshore up the Affordable Care Act and make Medicare part of the health-care marketplace,\u201d eventually making \u201chealth care for all a reality\u201d (in the days since the profile was published, he has already rejected an actual single-payer model). We also learn that he supports the idea of higher incomes tax for the wealthy (refusing to offer any kind of number, where others have), and that he thinks the Green New Deal is a totally rad idea \u2014 at least \u201cin spirit.\u201d\nOn the other hand, we do learn a great deal about such things as O\u2019Rourke\u2019s impressive shelf of presidential biographies (\u201carranged in historical order [thus suggesting] there\u2019s been some reflection on the gravity of the presidency \u2026\u201d), his fondness for rock memoirs, and his partiality to recordings by Nina Simone and The Clash. Quite a few adjectives are offered to describe O\u2019Rourke\u2019s personal qualities, but these, too, come with a crippling lack of specificity. We learn, for example, that he has a knack for seeming \u201cfree of political calculation, as if his charisma were a mere side effect of Beto just being Beto\u201d \u2014 the evidence for this being that O\u2019Rourke was seen air-drumming to The Who\u2019s \u201cBaba O\u2019Reilly\u201d while \u201cwaiting for burgers at a drive-through the night he debated Ted Cruz at Southern Methodist University.\u201d\nIndeed, much of the piece\u2019s portrait of O\u2019Rourke (both as a person and a politician) hinges on derivative cultural signifiers that tell us just as little as the candidate\u2019s laboriously vague statements on health care and border policy; for example: \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke is quintessentially Generation X, weaned on Star Wars and punk rock and priding himself on authenticity over showmanship and a healthy skepticism of the mainstream.\u201d\nIf Authenticity\u2122 and Charisma\u2122 are supposed to be the cruxes of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s personal style, we also learn that his message is one of \u201chonesty\u201d \u2014 though what exactly he intends to be honest about is apparently none of our business, his own declarations on the matter being positively postmodern in their indeterminacy:\n\u201cIf I bring something to this \u2026. I think it is my ability to listen to people, to help bring people together to do something that is thought to be impossible \u2026. I may have an ability to work with people who think differently than I do, come to a different conclusion that I\u2019ve come to on a given issue, and yet find enough common ground to do something better than what we have right now.\u201d\n(Lofty proclamation tempered with post-partisan platitude seems to be a hallmark flourish of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rhetorical style, as when he declared during his Senate campaign: \u201cWe\u2019re not running against anyone, any party, or anything. We\u2019re running for Texas, for this country, for the big, bold, ambitious work we want to accomplish together.\u201d)\nFrom start to finish, with several able assists from O\u2019Rourke himself, the Vanity Fair story reads more like a piece of political fan fiction than a serious (let alone even slightly critical) profile of someone who wants to be president with any specific purpose in mind, right down to its cringeworthy final sentences:\n\u201cThe more he talks, the more he likes the sound of what he\u2019s saying. \u2018I want to be in it,\u2019 he says, now leaning forward. \u2018Man, I\u2019m just born to be in it, and want to do everything I humanly can for this country at this moment.\u2019 A month later, Beto O\u2019Rourke announces his run for the White House.\u201d\nTo return to the initial question then: why exactly do so many influential liberals believe Beto O\u2019Rourke 2020 is a good idea?\nA partial answer is that O\u2019Rourke reflects more or less the only presidential archetype Democrats have been able or willing to conjure since the Clintonite turn in the 1990s. Though material conditions for vast parts of their electoral base have continued to deteriorate, and though the country\u2019s politics has in many respects continued to move rightward, personally charismatic Democrats with decidedly centrist politics have won the White House four times since 1992.\nBack in 2008, Barack Obama \u2014 by most measures, a far more talented politician than either Clinton or O\u2019Rourke \u2014 ran and won as a kind of universal political cipher, rhetorically attacking special interests while also praising Ronald Reagan and pitching himself to the middle of the middle. He stood for everything and anything, and therefore nothing in particular \u2014 nothing, at least, that wasn\u2019t already mostly acceptable to Washington\u2019s conservative-minded policy consensus. Obama himself was quite conscious of it: \u201cI serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views,\u201d he wrote in The Audacity of Hope.\nThat, of course, is the real rub with candidates who say they\u2019re neither left nor right, or those who gesture vaguely towards both: without a discernible program, set of values, or a clearly defined ideology, political leadership tends to default to whatever context it\u2019s situated in. When that\u2019s an atrophied Washington establishment, flooded with big donors, lobbyists, and hack politicians, we can usually expect some aggregate of the interests of all three to be what passes for progress, especially when the occupant of the Oval Office eschews the language of contestation in favor of hollow liturgies about bringing people (read: Beltway interest groups) \u201ctogether.\u201d\nLacking Obama\u2019s compelling personal story and Clinton\u2019s skillfully contrived folksiness, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s general pitch nevertheless has much in common with the one championed by the previous two Democratic presidents.\nIf some elite liberals are trying to get the rest of us excited by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s candidacy, then, one reason is that it conforms so closely to the mold of politics with which they\u2019re most familiar and comfortable \u2014 a politics which is avowedly about very little but nevertheless inspires tremendous fervor among the devoted.\nHe is ideologically vague and deliberately so. He is politically ambidextrous, talking endlessly about the need for debate, compromise, bipartisanship, and reaching across the aisle. He combines high-minded sentiments about historical destiny with ethereal notions about hearing from all sides and taking seriously all points of view.\nO\u2019Rourke is therefore as much a brand and a product as he is a prospective national leader: an unfolding cultural narrative in which to become emotionally invested for mostly apolitical reasons, like the question of which team will win the Super Bowl or who will finally sit on the Iron Throne at the end of season eight. Fronting for an all-too-conventional style of Beltway politics, his personality is a tabula rasa upon which sundry groups in the Democratic coalition are invited to inscribe most anything they please and see themselves reflected. If we are to go by Vanity Fair\u2019s account, his cultural tastes usefully align with those of several key demographics and are squeaky clean with just a wee bit of #Edge. Most important of all, he is adept at seeming to say a whole lot while actually saying very little, trading in substance-free feel-goodisms with the smarmy bravado of an over-caffeinated self-help guru or door-to-door salesman \u2014 a quality admired above all others in the gilded, marketing-obsessed environment of Washington D.C.\nWhen politics has been stripped of program or ideological commitment \u2014 as it increasingly has been for many elite Democrats \u2014 all that is left is to recast the whole enterprise as a grand exercise in fan fiction: one that devotes tremendous energy to crafting a series of catch-all personalities who audition to play protagonists in the nation\u2019s collective psyche. While meeting with students at the University of Texas at El Paso last year, O\u2019Rourke himself in fact compared the battle against Trump to \u201cevery epic movie that you\u2019ve ever seen, from Star Wars to The Lord of the Rings.\u201d\nFor a privileged few, the 2020 presidential election may be just this: a notional spectacle whose stakes are so low that they can be communicated through appeals to mass-market fantasy. For the majority of Americans, though, the stakes are all too high, and there\u2019s precious little time for another round of fan fiction.",

Charles McQuillan / Getty</p> </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Numbers help make sense of some matters. On January 30, 1972 at 2:45 PM, between ten and fifteen thousand supporters of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association began a march protesting the British government&rsquo;s policy of internment without trial. Marching towards the rally point, they were blocked by a British Army barrier. Many were forced down nearby streets, some protestors threw stones at soldiers, and at 3:55 PM soldiers opened fire. From the first to the last shot, a total of one hundred rounds of ammunition were fired. Thirteen people died <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/explainer-what-happened-on-bloody-sunday-in-1972-1.3825614\">that day</a>, one more several months later, and fourteen more were injured. An inquiry commissioned in 1998 found that sixteen soldiers had used excessive force. Between that day and the decision on whether to charge the soldiers responsible, forty-seven years elapsed. One soldier was charged.</p>\n<p>With a trial now underway, some matters are <em>sub judice</em>, but the Saville Inquiry and the Police Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland have ascertained the facts of the day. The question hangs over whether the one person charged &mdash; the semi-anonymous &ldquo;Soldier F&rdquo; &mdash;merely killed, or instead murdered, the people who died at his hands that day. He will not be charged for at least two of the deaths for which he is responsible. Patrick Doherty was crawling away from the regiment when he was shot in the buttock, the bullet piercing his right flank. Rushing to his aid, Barney McGuigan waved a white handkerchief. Soldier F dropped to one knee and shot him through the head.</p>\n<p>Soldier F is not facing trial for murder for these two deaths because he is the only surviving witness. Statements from deceased witnesses are inadmissible to a murder trial. He will face trial for the murder of James Wray and William McKinney, who were both shot in the back, and the attempted murder of Patrick O&rsquo;Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon, and Michael Quinn, all of whom were injured on the day. The delay in justice played a key role in bringing about the fact that only one soldier was charged. Throughout the statement explaining the decision not to bring charges, the fact many witnesses were now dead was often the main impetus for not pursuing a murder charge.</p>\n<p>The families were understandably devastated. But the response of the British government tallies with the similarly callous and performatively uninformed comments of the Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/03/ireland-independence-uk-nationalism-brexit\">a week earlier</a>. Bradley was publicly condemned and forced to apologize after claiming that &ldquo;The [deaths] at the hands of the military and police were not crimes. They were people acting under orders and under instruction and fulfilling their duty in a dignified and appropriate way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>One soldier, granted immunity during the Saville Inquiry, told how of he saw one soldier indiscriminately fire off twenty rounds of ammunition toward a block of flats. Many of the Bloody Sunday victims were shot in the back. On August 9, near Springfield Park during the Ballymurphy Massacre in Belfast, Bobby Clarke took a baby from the area and on returning to remove more children was shot in the back.

                "text": "Numbers help make sense of some matters. On January 30, 1972 at 2:45 PM, between ten and fifteen thousand supporters of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association began a march protesting the British government\u2019s policy of internment without trial. Marching towards the rally point, they were blocked by a British Army barrier. Many were forced down nearby streets, some protestors threw stones at soldiers, and at 3:55 PM soldiers opened fire. From the first to the last shot, a total of one hundred rounds of ammunition were fired. Thirteen people died that day, one more several months later, and fourteen more were injured. An inquiry commissioned in 1998 found that sixteen soldiers had used excessive force. Between that day and the decision on whether to charge the soldiers responsible, forty-seven years elapsed. One soldier was charged.\nWith a trial now underway, some matters are sub judice, but the Saville Inquiry and the Police Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland have ascertained the facts of the day. The question hangs over whether the one person charged \u2014 the semi-anonymous \u201cSoldier F\u201d \u2014merely killed, or instead murdered, the people who died at his hands that day. He will not be charged for at least two of the deaths for which he is responsible. Patrick Doherty was crawling away from the regiment when he was shot in the buttock, the bullet piercing his right flank. Rushing to his aid, Barney McGuigan waved a white handkerchief. Soldier F dropped to one knee and shot him through the head.\nSoldier F is not facing trial for murder for these two deaths because he is the only surviving witness. Statements from deceased witnesses are inadmissible to a murder trial. He will face trial for the murder of James Wray and William McKinney, who were both shot in the back, and the attempted murder of Patrick O\u2019Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon, and Michael Quinn, all of whom were injured on the day. The delay in justice played a key role in bringing about the fact that only one soldier was charged. Throughout the statement explaining the decision not to bring charges, the fact many witnesses were now dead was often the main impetus for not pursuing a murder charge.\nThe families were understandably devastated. But the response of the British government tallies with the similarly callous and performatively uninformed comments of the Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley a week earlier. Bradley was publicly condemned and forced to apologize after claiming that \u201cThe [deaths] at the hands of the military and police were not crimes. They were people acting under orders and under instruction and fulfilling their duty in a dignified and appropriate way.\u201d\nOne soldier, granted immunity during the Saville Inquiry, told how of he saw one soldier indiscriminately fire off twenty rounds of ammunition toward a block of flats. Many of the Bloody Sunday victims were shot in the back. On August 9, near Springfield Park during the Ballymurphy Massacre in Belfast, Bobby Clarke took a baby from the area and on returning to remove more children was shot in the back. Father Mullan, a Catholic priest, ran to his aid waving a white baby\u2019s onesie after informing soldiers via telephone he was running to help injured people. After administering Clarke his last rites, Fr Mullan was shot in the back and killed. A dignified and appropriate death is perhaps possible, but being shot in the back by soldiers as you attempt to save civilians\u2019 lives can in no circumstances be described as \u201cdignified and appropriate.\u201d\nDefense Minister Gavin Williamson went further in responding to the announcement that one soldier would face prosecution, stating, \u201cWe will offer full legal and pastoral support to the individual affected by today\u2019s decision. This includes funding all his legal costs and providing welfare support. The Ministry of Defence is working across government to drive through a new package of safeguards to ensure our armed forces are not unfairly treated. And the government will urgently reform the system for dealing with legacy issues. Our serving and former personnel cannot live in constant fear of prosecution.\u201d\nEssentially, Williamson has signaled that the government is fully backing Soldier F morally and financially, and sees his trial as an affront to British military operations. Very few British soldiers have ever been prosecuted for killing civilians. One could argue that to avoid \u201cliving in constant fear of prosecution\u201d a soldier could adhere to the law and not kill unarmed citizens indiscriminately. Williamson clearly believes new measures are needed to prevent the prosecution of soldiers who are found to have repeatedly perjured themselves and killed unarmed civilians in future.\nHis comments are outrageous, and victims\u2019 families \u2014 fresh from the disappointment of seeing very little prospect of justice, with most soldiers not facing charges \u2014 have called for an investigation into his comments possibly prejudicing a trial.

Knowing that the victims, and those who feel sympathy and express solidarity with the victims, will never be Tory voters, he jumps upon a vote-winning stance with scant regard for moral decency. This is a worrying fallout from the referendum on the European Union: the revival of ardent nationalism, rose-tinted misrepresentations of colonial history, and a refusal to engage with the genuine story of the United Kingdom\u2019s creation and historical record.\nNowhere is this more evident than in the attitude of many politicians and sections of the general public towards Ireland. Many have flippantly suggested that the Irish Republic \u201crejoin\u201d Britain, refusing to accept the reality of the border and the importance of the Good Friday Agreement.

Soldiers were offered immunity if they told the truth and chose to lie rather than transmit the facts to the victims\u2019 relatives and the historical record. And they have been fully supported by the government in doing so.\nThe more obsessive side of the drive towards Brexit comes in large part from hard-line English nationalists; many of these are in government. Warning that peace in the North of Ireland is potentially jeopardized by Brexit matters little to them, because they have never cared about Ireland in any case. But that contempt for life extends to the rest of the country. Austerity is only possible when you are happy to starve people to keep the richest happier.\nThe endless rhetorical call-backs to the Second World War and the height of colonialism show a morbid nationalistic preoccupation with a certain historical model of Britain, and thus a certain model of Britons. That necessitates a hierarchy of life, deciding which lives are worth protecting and which can simply be snuffed out without consequence. For many of those pushing this demented patriotism, Brexit is the opportunity to revive old colonial mindsets, setting Britain on course to start wars to compete culturally and economically.\nThis is unlikely to end well for people of other nationalities in the UK: Brexit has seen a rise in reports of xenophobic and racist attacks and verbal taunts.

The murders of Karl Liebknecht and <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2016/01/rosa-luxemburg-paul-buhle-clr-james-reform-revolution-german-spd\">Rosa Luxemburg</a> in January 1919 are generally seen as the decisive turning point.</p>\n<p>But much less well-known are the decisive battles of March 1919, when a nationwide general strike called for the socialization of heavy industry and the anchoring of workers&rsquo; councils in the German constitution. The revolution was ultimately crushed by bloody force &mdash; over a thousand people were killed in Berlin alone. Yet its failure owed, more than anything, to deep-rooted contradictions within the workers&rsquo; movement itself.</p>\n<p>Such tensions had emerged during World War I, at the very origin of the revolution. Left-wing and revolutionary forces in the workers&rsquo; movement gathered into the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) in protest against the civilizational collapse, while the <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/07/second-international-bernstein-rosa-luxemburg-unions-world-war\">Majority Social Democrats (SPD)</a> continued to support the war. The USPD was extremely heterogenous. It united <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/01/reform-revolution-rosa-luxemburg-socialism-democracy\">committed revolutionaries</a> like Luxemburg and Liebknecht but also many so-called revisionists like Eduard Bernstein who had been eager to transform the SPD into a reformist party even before the war. Their only real point of agreement was a rejection of the senseless bloodbath on the battlefields of Europe.</p>\n<p>The USPD as a whole thus had neither the will nor the strength to organize a revolution. Smaller groupings began to form in the party from the beginning, like Luxemburg and Liebknecht&rsquo;s Spartacus Group or the network of &ldquo;Revolutionary Shop Stewards&rdquo; represented by radical trade unionist <a href=\"https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/766-working-class-politics-in-the-german-revolution\">Richard M&uuml;ller</a>. While the Spartacus Group concentrated mostly on demonstrations and propaganda leaflets and the USPD agitated against the war in parliament, the shop stewards were the only ones who could build a revolutionary organization rooted in workplaces. Politically speaking, they were undoubtedly dependent on analysis put out by the Spartacus Group, but organizationally they were more deeply embedded in the working class than other left-wing groups.</p>\n<p>Emerging out of the German Metalworkers Union (DMV) around 1915, the Shop Stewards organized three large mass strikes between 1916 and January 1918, some with hundreds of thousands of participants across the country. These strikes were the result of careful preparation. At first, the Shop Stewards only protested the strike ban imposed by the war, but &mdash; influenced not least by the events of the <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2017/11/the-russian-revolution-at-100\">Russian Revolution</a> &mdash; gradually became dedicated revolutionaries. Only over the course of 1918 would the majority of workers come to understand that there could be no peace without revolution. Yet what would come after this revolution was not even clear to the revolutionaries themselves.</p>\n<p>The informal and clandestine Berlin &ldquo;Workers&rsquo; Council,&rdquo; in which delegates from the left wing of the USPD, the Shop Stewards, and the Spartacus Group had been discussing a common strategy since mid-1918, was devoted exclusively to debating how a seizure of power could work. When Richard M&uuml;ller later said the Shop Stewards pursued a &ldquo;council republic in the Russian style,&rdquo; this perhaps represented an expression of radicalism hard to find in the workers&rsquo; movement before 1914. But this empty formulation in fact said little about the post-revolutionary order itself.</p>\n<p>Blueprints for a post-capitalist society drafted by vanguards have always proven illusory when faced with the test of events, and in the worst cases dictatorial. Facing censorship, military dictatorship, and the German police state, the Left in 1918 found it equally difficult if not impossible to develop a detailed revolutionary vision in dialogue with its social base.</p>\n<p>The revolution that broke out in fall 1918 was driven by two popular demands: overthrowing the monarchy and ending the war. The first happened on November 9, 1918, and the second was secured with the armistice of November 11, 1918. Officially, the country was now a &ldquo;socialist republic&rdquo; governed by a Workers&rsquo; Council. But what would come next? Should the provisional Councils develop into a more permanent system &mdash; or should a national assembly draft a constitution? The Left was divided over these issues. Only under the pressure of the revolution itself could a further differentiation of political currents occur, expressed by the founding of the Communist Party (KPD) on New Year&rsquo;s Day 1919. By the time this process concluded, however, the revolution was already at its end.</p>\n<p>The basic problem undermining the revolution was the fact that the workers&rsquo; movement as a whole had not prepared for it before 1914. Despite its Marxist rhetoric, the SPD in Imperial Germany did not cultivate anything approaching a revolutionary praxis. There was little real connection between the day-to-day struggle and the long-term socialist goal. Only the war would place the question of revolution suddenly and immediately back onto the agenda.</p>\n<p>The difficulty of making up for long-neglected political clarification in the heat of the revolution itself &mdash; not least under constant threat of counterrevolutionary violence &mdash; ultimately led the revolutionaries to defeat. The SPD continued to <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2017/11/german-social-democratic-party-second-international-culture\">command respect and loyalty</a> among a broad swathe of the working population, and, tragically, this party also perceived the radical left as a greater danger than the Right. Friedrich Ebert&rsquo;s social-democratic government permitted the counterrevolutionary military to strike a decisive blow to the revolution.</p>\n<p>At first the workers&rsquo; parties had been forced into a short-lived pact. Though the Shop Stewards and their allies had dominated the upheavals in Berlin on November 9, the Left was nonetheless compelled to accept an alliance with the SPD and form a government together with it. Pressure from below clamored for &ldquo;unity&rdquo; and equal representation for both workers&rsquo; parties in the new government.</p>\n<p>The workers and soldiers took command in the factories and barracks by forming their own councils, but had no intention of consolidating them into a permanent state. Most workers trusted that the armistice had removed the war question &mdash; understood as the essential reason for division &mdash; and that the socialist government between SPD and USPD formed on November 9 would now begin to &ldquo;do&rdquo; socialism.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Socialism&rdquo; in 1919 meant socializing the key industries viewed as &ldquo;ripe&rdquo; for such change, primarily the major state-owned factories, mining, and heavy industry. The term &ldquo;socialization&rdquo; was usually understood to mean nationalization, though the councils insisted on certain rights to co-determination and oversight. The state implemented social policy from above, and party and trade union policies were determined by leaders whom the masses were expected to approve on election day. In this sense, the councils&rsquo; mere existence in November 1918 represented a radical break with the state-focused representational practices and ideas common to the socialist movement under the monarchy.</p>\n<p>This lack of clarification explains why the first Council Congress held on December 16&ndash;20, 1918 rejected the council system as a model for the new state, instead calling for elections to a bourgeois parliament in the form of the National Assembly. The Congress was the first nationwide assembly of Councils. SPD delegates, who represented the majority, carried the decision. Though the USPD agitated on behalf of the councils, which had already occupied real positions of power, these latter only represented a practical political alternative for a minority of workers.</p>\n<p>The majority at this point went with the Social Democrats and their program for a National Assembly, which they shared with the bourgeois parties. This overlap between the SPD and bourgeois policies was not the result of any betrayal or change on its part, but rather the product of years of parliamentary activity under the monarchy. The SPD simply could not fathom what a council-based democratic social order or workers&rsquo; control in the factories would even look like. Its delegates to the Council Congress were mostly movement veterans, socialized in trade unionism and municipal parliaments.</p>\n<p>The Left did not have a particularly clear platform either. Indeed, its theorization of the councils only took place markedly after the councils themselves seized power. Neither anarcho-syndicalism nor Marx&rsquo;s analysis of the Paris Commune had much of an impact in Germany, and describing them as predecessors to the councils thus makes little sense. The first councils emerged spontaneously during the 1917 and 1918 mass strikes, while their theorization developed only in early 1919. In practice, workers had not read anything on council socialism, and even leaders like Richard M&uuml;ller would theorize their experience only during the revolution. The council movement was &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo; &mdash; going from practice to theory, and not the other way around.</p>\n<p>Richard M&uuml;ller and Ernst D&auml;umig from the Revolutionary Shop Stewards would have a strong influence on theoretical debates on the Left through their magazine <em>Der Arbeiter-Rat</em>. Their theory of a &ldquo;pure council system&rdquo; mixed with anarcho-syndicalist ideas grew into a real, though ultimately failed mass movement in early 1919.</p>\n<p>The occasion for the strike movement in March 1919 was the population&rsquo;s dwindling faith in the work of the so-called People&rsquo;s Deputies and the National Assembly convening in Weimar. The biggest source of discontent was the government&rsquo;s foot-dragging on socialization policy, but the government had also committed several acts of violence against the Left in December and January.</p>\n<p>After gunfire was exchanged during a failed coup attempt on December 6, 1918, open warfare broke out in central Berlin on Christmas Eve when government troops fired on the City Palace housing revolutionary sailors. Only the intervention of Berlin&rsquo;s populace in the form of a mass demonstration was enough to stop the attack. Following these events, the USPD People&rsquo;s Deputies left the government and were replaced by Social Democrats, including Gustav Noske as Defense Minister.</p>\n<p>A second scandal followed in January 1919 when the president of police, USPD member Emil Eichhorn, was to be removed from office. A general strike broke out in response, which parts of the radical left sought to expand into a second revolution, but the uprising was poorly prepared and barely coordinated. The movement remained restricted to Berlin and was bloodily repressed, and the government remained in power. Following the uprising&rsquo;s defeat Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were murdered by right-wing <em>Freikorps</em> commanded by SPD Defense Minister Noske.</p>\n<p>The consequences of the January Uprising were catastrophic. The Left lost two of its most brilliant minds and the defeat demoralized Berlin, the center of the revolution, for months. Shortly thereafter the symbol of the Bavarian revolution, Kurt Eisner, was murdered in Munich. The January Uprising weakened the revolutionary left decisively, while also revealing how far Ebert&rsquo;s government was willing to go to win.</p>\n<p>Mainstream German historiography generally defends Ebert&rsquo;s pact with the generals, arguing that this curious alliance between monarchist <em>Freikorps</em> and the Social Democratic Party was necessary to prevent civil war and stabilize democracy. This tends to overlook the fact that the radical left also fought for democracy &mdash; albeit its own version. For the USPD and the young KPD, transitioning big industries into public ownership and regulating the economy through elected workers&rsquo; councils were necessary preconditions for a socialist democracy. Only capitalists were to be excluded from voting &mdash; the essence of the <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/08/lenin-state-and-revolution-miliband\">&ldquo;dictatorship of the proletariat&rdquo;</a> that featured in both parties&rsquo; programs. Though the details of socialism were hotly debated even on the Left, the dictatorship of a single party &mdash; let alone individual &mdash; was widely rejected.</p>\n<p>The most peculiar thing about the claim that the government sought to &ldquo;prevent civil war&rdquo; is the fact that such a civil war was already raging, and it was the <em>Freikorps</em> commanded by the SPD that not only failed to prevent it but repeatedly escalated it. By Christmas 1918 the overwhelming majority of World War I conscripts had gone home &mdash; the soldiers&rsquo; council movement collapsed overnight. Beyond scattered left-wing formations like the &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Naval Division&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Republikanische Soldatenwehr,&rdquo; the only troops still active were those with no home to return to or who had simply enjoyed the experience of war.</p>\n<p>These were paid mercenaries and monarchists, men who often believed in ethno-nationalist and &ldquo;Greater German&rdquo; ideas. Many had been promised land to settle in the east after Germany&rsquo;s victory, and their hatred for the supposed traitors back home knew no bounds. Antisemitism was common, blaming &ldquo;the Jews&rdquo; as responsible for both the Revolution and German defeat. This hatred fueled their violence and made them the perfect choice to crush a socialist uprising.</p>\n<p>The strikes in March 1919 represented the climax of a German civil war that essentially lasted until April 1920, when a last insurrection in the mines of the Ruhr region was crushed. Unlike the January Uprising and the later Ruhr uprising, the strikes in March 1919 were spread across multiple regions and thus much more threatening to the government. Mass strikes in the Ruhr, Central Germany, and Berlin demanded government recognition of the workers&rsquo; councils and the immediate socialization of key industries. The National Assembly in Weimar was practically besieged by the general strike, and unable to act.</p>\n<p>Yet the strikes were not coordinated in terms of timing or location. While one region was out in force, others were already beginning to stumble. They forced the government to make some concessions, constitutionally establishing the works councils (<em>Betriebsr&auml;te</em>) as a shop-floor representation of workers with limited powers. Even ideas for corporatist industrial planning on the regional and national level were written into the constitution, along with the legal framework that would have allowed the socialization of whole industries. But none of these latter provisions became reality, and the strikes that won these compromises were defeated one by one in spring 1919.</p>\n<p>This was an ongoing dilemma for the Left: while the government could make centralized decisions and had a disciplined army at its disposal, the revolution itself had no organizational center and no armed force to defend it. It essentially emerged from a peace movement and the majority of its members were not ready for a civil war. They only took up arms when they already had their backs to the wall. The same would be true for the March strikes.</p>\n<p>Despite the Left&rsquo;s de facto defeat in March 1919, government troops continued fighting even after the end of the strike. As in January, the soldiers showed no interest in negotiations but instead sought to physically annihilate their enemy. The violence was especially brutal in Berlin. Defended by armed workers, the eastern districts of the capital were besieged and shelled for days. Troops following the orders of Gustav Noske had no qualms firing heavy artillery into residential neighborhoods, a callous act of revenge causing over a thousand deaths. The attack included air raids, making Berlin the first city in German history to be bombed from the air. Both the People&rsquo;s Naval Division and the left wing of the Republikanische Soldatenwehr were liquidated in these battles, and with them the last republican troops in the capital.</p>\n<p>It was no coincidence that the National Assembly decreed the formation of a &ldquo;provisional army&rdquo; while fighting raged in Berlin on March 6, 1919. It envisioned an army with classical discipline, no more soldiers&rsquo; councils, and practically legalized the <em>Freikorps</em>. As the last republican troops were being picked off the paramilitaries of the extreme right were institutionalized as the new state&rsquo;s army. This tragic birth defect of the Weimar Republic would play a major role in its later downfall.</p>\n<p>The constitutional article on works councils nevertheless remained in place, and still exists in German labor law today. Yet these councils were worlds apart from the idea of the &ldquo;pure council system&rdquo; that animated revolutionary workers in 1919. The works councils eventually enacted by law in 1920 promoted cooperation between business owners and workers &mdash; corporatism, instead of socialism.</p>\n<p>The defeat of the March 1919 strikes was thus decisive for the struggle for the new republic&rsquo;s constitution. Unlike the January Uprising and the later local council republics, here a broad movement from the center of the working class came together to shift the revolution&rsquo;s direction one more time &mdash; and failed.</p>\n<p>What remained of the German Revolution was the establishment of Germany&rsquo;s first democracy, including women&rsquo;s right to vote, the works councils, and the eight-hour day. These all constituted democratic advances. Yet this program was asserted in opposition to the majority of the working class, who had instead fought for a more radical, socialist democracy.</p>",

                "text": "Thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and over a century since the fall of the monarchy, the \u201cNovember Revolution\u201d of 1918\u20131919 still remains a controversial topic in German public life. Recent commemorations of the one hundredth anniversary were fairly sympathetic to these events, though this also underlined the degree to which the \u201crevolution\u201d and its history have today become little more than a museum piece.\nSome see the uprising as a transition to Germany\u2019s first democracy, while others view it as a \u201crevolution betrayed\u201d \u2014 an attempt to create socialism that was violently repressed. The murders of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg in January 1919 are generally seen as the decisive turning point.\nBut much less well-known are the decisive battles of March 1919, when a nationwide general strike called for the socialization of heavy industry and the anchoring of workers\u2019 councils in the German constitution. The revolution was ultimately crushed by bloody force \u2014 over a thousand people were killed in Berlin alone. Yet its failure owed, more than anything, to deep-rooted contradictions within the workers\u2019 movement itself.\nSuch tensions had emerged during World War I, at the very origin of the revolution. Left-wing and revolutionary forces in the workers\u2019 movement gathered into the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) in protest against the civilizational collapse, while the Majority Social Democrats (SPD) continued to support the war. The USPD was extremely heterogenous. It united committed revolutionaries like Luxemburg and Liebknecht but also many so-called revisionists like Eduard Bernstein who had been eager to transform the SPD into a reformist party even before the war. Their only real point of agreement was a rejection of the senseless bloodbath on the battlefields of Europe.\nThe USPD as a whole thus had neither the will nor the strength to organize a revolution. Smaller groupings began to form in the party from the beginning, like Luxemburg and Liebknecht\u2019s Spartacus Group or the network of \u201cRevolutionary Shop Stewards\u201d represented by radical trade unionist Richard M\u00fcller. While the Spartacus Group concentrated mostly on demonstrations and propaganda leaflets and the USPD agitated against the war in parliament, the shop stewards were the only ones who could build a revolutionary organization rooted in workplaces. Politically speaking, they were undoubtedly dependent on analysis put out by the Spartacus Group, but organizationally they were more deeply embedded in the working class than other left-wing groups.\nEmerging out of the German Metalworkers Union (DMV) around 1915, the Shop Stewards organized three large mass strikes between 1916 and January 1918, some with hundreds of thousands of participants across the country. These strikes were the result of careful preparation. At first, the Shop Stewards only protested the strike ban imposed by the war, but \u2014 influenced not least by the events of the Russian Revolution \u2014 gradually became dedicated revolutionaries. Only over the course of 1918 would the majority of workers come to understand that there could be no peace without revolution. Yet what would come after this revolution was not even clear to the revolutionaries themselves.\nThe informal and clandestine Berlin \u201cWorkers\u2019 Council,\u201d in which delegates from the left wing of the USPD, the Shop Stewards, and the Spartacus Group had been discussing a common strategy since mid-1918, was devoted exclusively to debating how a seizure of power could work. When Richard M\u00fcller later said the Shop Stewards pursued a \u201ccouncil republic in the Russian style,\u201d this perhaps represented an expression of radicalism hard to find in the workers\u2019 movement before 1914. But this empty formulation in fact said little about the post-revolutionary order itself.\nBlueprints for a post-capitalist society drafted by vanguards have always proven illusory when faced with the test of events, and in the worst cases dictatorial. Facing censorship, military dictatorship, and the German police state, the Left in 1918 found it equally difficult if not impossible to develop a detailed revolutionary vision in dialogue with its social base.\nThe revolution that broke out in fall 1918 was driven by two popular demands: overthrowing the monarchy and ending the war. The first happened on November 9, 1918, and the second was secured with the armistice of November 11, 1918. Officially, the country was now a \u201csocialist republic\u201d governed by a Workers\u2019 Council. But what would come next? Should the provisional Councils develop into a more permanent system \u2014 or should a national assembly draft a constitution? The Left was divided over these issues. Only under the pressure of the revolution itself could a further differentiation of political currents occur, expressed by the founding of the Communist Party (KPD) on New Year\u2019s Day 1919. By the time this process concluded, however, the revolution was already at its end.\nThe basic problem undermining the revolution was the fact that the workers\u2019 movement as a whole had not prepared for it before 1914. Despite its Marxist rhetoric, the SPD in Imperial Germany did not cultivate anything approaching a revolutionary praxis. There was little real connection between the day-to-day struggle and the long-term socialist goal. Only the war would place the question of revolution suddenly and immediately back onto the agenda.\nThe difficulty of making up for long-neglected political clarification in the heat of the revolution itself \u2014 not least under constant threat of counterrevolutionary violence \u2014 ultimately led the revolutionaries to defeat. The SPD continued to command respect and loyalty among a broad swathe of the working population, and, tragically, this party also perceived the radical left as a greater danger than the Right. Friedrich Ebert\u2019s social-democratic government permitted the counterrevolutionary military to strike a decisive blow to the revolution.\nAt first the workers\u2019 parties had been forced into a short-lived pact. Though the Shop Stewards and their allies had dominated the upheavals in Berlin on November 9, the Left was nonetheless compelled to accept an alliance with the SPD and form a government together with it. Pressure from below clamored for \u201cunity\u201d and equal representation for both workers\u2019 parties in the new government.\nThe workers and soldiers took command in the factories and barracks by forming their own councils, but had no intention of consolidating them into a permanent state. Most workers trusted that the armistice had removed the war question \u2014 understood as the essential reason for division \u2014 and that the socialist government between SPD and USPD formed on November 9 would now begin to \u201cdo\u201d socialism.\n\u201cSocialism\u201d in 1919 meant socializing the key industries viewed as \u201cripe\u201d for such change, primarily the major state-owned factories, mining, and heavy industry. The term \u201csocialization\u201d was usually understood to mean nationalization, though the councils insisted on certain rights to co-determination and oversight. The state implemented social policy from above, and party and trade union policies were determined by leaders whom the masses were expected to approve on election day. In this sense, the councils\u2019 mere existence in November 1918 represented a radical break with the state-focused representational practices and ideas common to the socialist movement under the monarchy.\nThis lack of clarification explains why the first Council Congress held on December 16\u201320, 1918 rejected the council system as a model for the new state, instead calling for elections to a bourgeois parliament in the form of the National Assembly. The Congress was the first nationwide assembly of Councils. SPD delegates, who represented the majority, carried the decision. Though the USPD agitated on behalf of the councils, which had already occupied real positions of power, these latter only represented a practical political alternative for a minority of workers.\nThe majority at this point went with the Social Democrats and their program for a National Assembly, which they shared with the bourgeois parties. This overlap between the SPD and bourgeois policies was not the result of any betrayal or change on its part, but rather the product of years of parliamentary activity under the monarchy. The SPD simply could not fathom what a council-based democratic social order or workers\u2019 control in the factories would even look like. Its delegates to the Council Congress were mostly movement veterans, socialized in trade unionism and municipal parliaments.\nThe Left did not have a particularly clear platform either. Indeed, its theorization of the councils only took place markedly after the councils themselves seized power. Neither anarcho-syndicalism nor Marx\u2019s analysis of the Paris Commune had much of an impact in Germany, and describing them as predecessors to the councils thus makes little sense. The first councils emerged spontaneously during the 1917 and 1918 mass strikes, while their theorization developed only in early 1919. In practice, workers had not read anything on council socialism, and even leaders like Richard M\u00fcller would theorize their experience only during the revolution. The council movement was \u201clearning by doing\u201d \u2014 going from practice to theory, and not the other way around.\nRichard M\u00fcller and Ernst D\u00e4umig from the Revolutionary Shop Stewards would have a strong influence on theoretical debates on the Left through their magazine Der Arbeiter-Rat. Their theory of a \u201cpure council system\u201d mixed with anarcho-syndicalist ideas grew into a real, though ultimately failed mass movement in early 1919.\nThe occasion for the strike movement in March 1919 was the population\u2019s dwindling faith in the work of the so-called People\u2019s Deputies and the National Assembly convening in Weimar. The biggest source of discontent was the government\u2019s foot-dragging on socialization policy, but the government had also committed several acts of violence against the Left in December and January.\nAfter gunfire was exchanged during a failed coup attempt on December 6, 1918, open warfare broke out in central Berlin on Christmas Eve when government troops fired on the City Palace housing revolutionary sailors. Only the intervention of Berlin\u2019s populace in the form of a mass demonstration was enough to stop the attack. Following these events, the USPD People\u2019s Deputies left the government and were replaced by Social Democrats, including Gustav Noske as Defense Minister.\nA second scandal followed in January 1919 when the president of police, USPD member Emil Eichhorn, was to be removed from office. A general strike broke out in response, which parts of the radical left sought to expand into a second revolution, but the uprising was poorly prepared and barely coordinated. The movement remained restricted to Berlin and was bloodily repressed, and the government remained in power. Following the uprising\u2019s defeat Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were murdered by right-wing Freikorps commanded by SPD Defense Minister Noske.\nThe consequences of the January Uprising were catastrophic. The Left lost two of its most brilliant minds and the defeat demoralized Berlin, the center of the revolution, for months. Shortly thereafter the symbol of the Bavarian revolution, Kurt Eisner, was murdered in Munich. The January Uprising weakened the revolutionary left decisively, while also revealing how far Ebert\u2019s government was willing to go to win.\nMainstream German historiography generally defends Ebert\u2019s pact with the generals, arguing that this curious alliance between monarchist Freikorps and the Social Democratic Party was necessary to prevent civil war and stabilize democracy. This tends to overlook the fact that the radical left also fought for democracy \u2014 albeit its own version. For the USPD and the young KPD, transitioning big industries into public ownership and regulating the economy through elected workers\u2019 councils were necessary preconditions for a socialist democracy. Only capitalists were to be excluded from voting \u2014 the essence of the \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d that featured in both parties\u2019 programs. Though the details of socialism were hotly debated even on the Left, the dictatorship of a single party \u2014 let alone individual \u2014 was widely rejected.\nThe most peculiar thing about the claim that the government sought to \u201cprevent civil war\u201d is the fact that such a civil war was already raging, and it was the Freikorps commanded by the SPD that not only failed to prevent it but repeatedly escalated it. By Christmas 1918 the overwhelming majority of World War I conscripts had gone home \u2014 the soldiers\u2019 council movement collapsed overnight. Beyond scattered left-wing formations like the \u201cPeople\u2019s Naval Division\u201d and the \u201cRepublikanische Soldatenwehr,\u201d the only troops still active were those with no home to return to or who had simply enjoyed the experience of war.\nThese were paid mercenaries and monarchists, men who often believed in ethno-nationalist and \u201cGreater German\u201d ideas. Many had been promised land to settle in the east after Germany\u2019s victory, and their hatred for the supposed traitors back home knew no bounds. Antisemitism was common, blaming \u201cthe Jews\u201d as responsible for both the Revolution and German defeat. This hatred fueled their violence and made them the perfect choice to crush a socialist uprising.\nThe strikes in March 1919 represented the climax of a German civil war that essentially lasted until April 1920, when a last insurrection in the mines of the Ruhr region was crushed. Unlike the January Uprising and the later Ruhr uprising, the strikes in March 1919 were spread across multiple regions and thus much more threatening to the government. Mass strikes in the Ruhr, Central Germany, and Berlin demanded government recognition of the workers\u2019 councils and the immediate socialization of key industries. The National Assembly in Weimar was practically besieged by the general strike, and unable to act.\nYet the strikes were not coordinated in terms of timing or location. While one region was out in force, others were already beginning to stumble. They forced the government to make some concessions, constitutionally establishing the works councils (Betriebsr\u00e4te) as a shop-floor representation of workers with limited powers. Even ideas for corporatist industrial planning on the regional and national level were written into the constitution, along with the legal framework that would have allowed the socialization of whole industries. But none of these latter provisions became reality, and the strikes that won these compromises were defeated one by one in spring 1919.\nThis was an ongoing dilemma for the Left: while the government could make centralized decisions and had a disciplined army at its disposal, the revolution itself had no organizational center and no armed force to defend it. It essentially emerged from a peace movement and the majority of its members were not ready for a civil war. They only took up arms when they already had their backs to the wall. The same would be true for the March strikes.\nDespite the Left\u2019s de facto defeat in March 1919, government troops continued fighting even after the end of the strike. As in January, the soldiers showed no interest in negotiations but instead sought to physically annihilate their enemy. The violence was especially brutal in Berlin. Defended by armed workers, the eastern districts of the capital were besieged and shelled for days. Troops following the orders of Gustav Noske had no qualms firing heavy artillery into residential neighborhoods, a callous act of revenge causing over a thousand deaths. The attack included air raids, making Berlin the first city in German history to be bombed from the air. Both the People\u2019s Naval Division and the left wing of the Republikanische Soldatenwehr were liquidated in these battles, and with them the last republican troops in the capital.\nIt was no coincidence that the National Assembly decreed the formation of a \u201cprovisional army\u201d while fighting raged in Berlin on March 6, 1919. It envisioned an army with classical discipline, no more soldiers\u2019 councils, and practically legalized the Freikorps. As the last republican troops were being picked off the paramilitaries of the extreme right were institutionalized as the new state\u2019s army. This tragic birth defect of the Weimar Republic would play a major role in its later downfall.\nThe constitutional article on works councils nevertheless remained in place, and still exists in German labor law today. Yet these councils were worlds apart from the idea of the \u201cpure council system\u201d that animated revolutionary workers in 1919. The works councils eventually enacted by law in 1920 promoted cooperation between business owners and workers \u2014 corporatism, instead of socialism.\nThe defeat of the March 1919 strikes was thus decisive for the struggle for the new republic\u2019s constitution. Unlike the January Uprising and the later local council republics, here a broad movement from the center of the working class came together to shift the revolution\u2019s direction one more time \u2014 and failed.\nWhat remained of the German Revolution was the establishment of Germany\u2019s first democracy, including women\u2019s right to vote, the works councils, and the eight-hour day. These all constituted democratic advances. Yet this program was asserted in opposition to the majority of the working class, who had instead fought for a more radical, socialist democracy.",
