                "html": "<p>Marie Le Conte is a French journalist, based in London. The opinions in this article belong to the author.</p>\n<p>(CNN)As flames ripped through the roof and into the spire of the Cathedral of Notre Dame on Monday night, French President Emmanuel Macron addressed his citizens.</p>\n<p>Looking distraught, he said: &quot;Notre Dame is our history, it's our literature, it's our imagery. It's the place where we live our greatest moments, from wars to pandemics to liberations ... I'm telling you all tonight -- we will rebuild this cathedral together. This is probably part of the French destiny.&quot;</p>\n<p>And perhaps for the first time, he spoke for the nation.</p>\n<p>Macron never did seem suited to the dull realities of day-to-day life. He has only been French President for two years and only has been in politics altogether for a few more. But it is hard to imagine him anywhere else.</p>\n<p>He sauntered into the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e while still in his late thirties, his mix of intellectual gravitas and childlike arrogance already proving controversial then. All has not been well since.</p>\n<p>In fact, Macron was scheduled to record a televised address on Monday night, partly to discuss the concerns of the &quot;gilets jaunes&quot; -- the yellow vest demonstrators whose protests began months ago over fuel tax hike -- and the national debates that followed, and partly to launch what was dubbed Phase 2 of his presidency, a hopeful new start after some unstable months.</p>\n<p>No one knows what the President was going to say or how it would have been received. As he was getting ready to record it, the Cathedral of Notre Dame caught fire.</p>\n<p>When the images got worse, he dropped what he was doing and headed towards the River Seine. First, he tweeted just after 7 p.m. local time. His message spared a thought for &quot;all Catholics and all French people,&quot; adding that &quot;as all our countrymen, I am sad to be watching this part of us burn tonight.&quot;</p>\n<p>The wording could have seemed excessive. After all, Macron has long been derided for his love of pompous allegories and unnecessarily flowery language -- and France isn't exactly known for its restraint in that area.</p>\n<p>Still, it seemed to hit the mark for once, as did his televised speech later that evening.</p>\n<p>It is the way he expresses himself and the way he thinks. Simultaneously fascinated by the past and obsessed with the future, he seldom appears to be someone comfortable governing in the present.</p>\n<p>This has nearly led to his undoing a number of times. Appearing distant and with no sincere interest in the dreary, real lives of real people, he quickly gained the nickname &quot;President Des Riches,&quot; which should speak for itself.</p>\n<p>But even this characterization isn't quite right. While his policies have been criticized for favoring the better-off, his out-of-touch image goes beyond class concerns.</p>\n<p>Take his initial decision to take a Jupiterian, nearly distant approach to the presidency, or his revealing comment in an interview during the campaign about French people secretly yearning to be ruled by kings again.</p>\n<p>This worked for him early on, as his predecessors Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande had been profoundly, sometimes embarrassingly human. But one cannot run a country with sweeping vision alone.</p>\n<p>It is unclear whether Macron even likes the France that he is in charge of. He adores France for its history, waxes lyrical about the France shown in its classical literature, has a million and one ideas about what France could and should become and how it should present itself to the world. But all of these things are not the France that people live and work in today.</p>\n<p>A country isn't simply the image of a country, and Macron has demonstrably struggled when dealing with the more granular aspects of governing. Rarely has someone so obviously wished to be leading in poetry while being trapped in tedious prose.</p>\n<p>Luckily for him, the fire that ravaged Notre Dame Cathedral fit squarely into his comfort zone. Notre Dame is far more than a building: It is a symbol recognized across the country and the world. It shows France at its best and the weight of its history in all its shame and glory.</p>\n<p>Gen. Philippe P&eacute;tain was there, but so was Charles de Gaulle. Napol&eacute;on crowned himself emperor within its walls, and Victor Hugo made sure its roof would be remembered forever.</p>\n<p>Countries struggling to know what they stand for can find themselves clinging to the symbolism of inanimate objects, and France is no exception. It wasn't only a building burning down; the melancholy was deeper. In this context, Macron's grand words felt welcome and appropriate.</p>\n<p>Back in 2017, only a day after he was elected, not-quite-yet President Macron was told by Senate grandee G&eacute;rard Larcher: &quot;It's going to feel odd, at your age, but you're the father of the nation.&quot;</p>\n<p>It hasn't always felt like it, and perhaps will never feel like it again. But on that Monday evening, as Notre Dame was going down in flames, Emmanuel Macron did appear to be carrying France on his narrow shoulders, and it suited him quite well.</p>",

                "text": "Marie Le Conte is a French journalist, based in London. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n(CNN)As flames ripped through the roof and into the spire of the Cathedral of Notre Dame on Monday night, French President Emmanuel Macron addressed his citizens.\nLooking distraught, he said: \"Notre Dame is our history, it's our literature, it's our imagery. It's the place where we live our greatest moments, from wars to pandemics to liberations ... I'm telling you all tonight -- we will rebuild this cathedral together. This is probably part of the French destiny.\"\nAnd perhaps for the first time, he spoke for the nation.\nMacron never did seem suited to the dull realities of day-to-day life. He has only been French President for two years and only has been in politics altogether for a few more. But it is hard to imagine him anywhere else.\nHe sauntered into the \u00c9lys\u00e9e while still in his late thirties, his mix of intellectual gravitas and childlike arrogance already proving controversial then. All has not been well since.\nIn fact, Macron was scheduled to record a televised address on Monday night, partly to discuss the concerns of the \"gilets jaunes\" -- the yellow vest demonstrators whose protests began months ago over fuel tax hike -- and the national debates that followed, and partly to launch what was dubbed Phase 2 of his presidency, a hopeful new start after some unstable months.\nNo one knows what the President was going to say or how it would have been received. As he was getting ready to record it, the Cathedral of Notre Dame caught fire.\nWhen the images got worse, he dropped what he was doing and headed towards the River Seine. First, he tweeted just after 7 p.m. local time. His message spared a thought for \"all Catholics and all French people,\" adding that \"as all our countrymen, I am sad to be watching this part of us burn tonight.\"\nThe wording could have seemed excessive. After all, Macron has long been derided for his love of pompous allegories and unnecessarily flowery language -- and France isn't exactly known for its restraint in that area.\nStill, it seemed to hit the mark for once, as did his televised speech later that evening.\nIt is the way he expresses himself and the way he thinks. Simultaneously fascinated by the past and obsessed with the future, he seldom appears to be someone comfortable governing in the present.\nThis has nearly led to his undoing a number of times. Appearing distant and with no sincere interest in the dreary, real lives of real people, he quickly gained the nickname \"President Des Riches,\" which should speak for itself.\nBut even this characterization isn't quite right. While his policies have been criticized for favoring the better-off, his out-of-touch image goes beyond class concerns.\nTake his initial decision to take a Jupiterian, nearly distant approach to the presidency, or his revealing comment in an interview during the campaign about French people secretly yearning to be ruled by kings again.\nThis worked for him early on, as his predecessors Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande had been profoundly, sometimes embarrassingly human. But one cannot run a country with sweeping vision alone.\nIt is unclear whether Macron even likes the France that he is in charge of. He adores France for its history, waxes lyrical about the France shown in its classical literature, has a million and one ideas about what France could and should become and how it should present itself to the world. But all of these things are not the France that people live and work in today.\nA country isn't simply the image of a country, and Macron has demonstrably struggled when dealing with the more granular aspects of governing. Rarely has someone so obviously wished to be leading in poetry while being trapped in tedious prose.\nLuckily for him, the fire that ravaged Notre Dame Cathedral fit squarely into his comfort zone. Notre Dame is far more than a building: It is a symbol recognized across the country and the world. It shows France at its best and the weight of its history in all its shame and glory.\nGen. Philippe P\u00e9tain was there, but so was Charles de Gaulle. Napol\u00e9on crowned himself emperor within its walls, and Victor Hugo made sure its roof would be remembered forever.\nCountries struggling to know what they stand for can find themselves clinging to the symbolism of inanimate objects, and France is no exception. It wasn't only a building burning down; the melancholy was deeper. In this context, Macron's grand words felt welcome and appropriate.\nBack in 2017, only a day after he was elected, not-quite-yet President Macron was told by Senate grandee G\u00e9rard Larcher: \"It's going to feel odd, at your age, but you're the father of the nation.\"\nIt hasn't always felt like it, and perhaps will never feel like it again. But on that Monday evening, as Notre Dame was going down in flames, Emmanuel Macron did appear to be carrying France on his narrow shoulders, and it suited him quite well.",

The prison's main yard has been well-known as a site for executions.</p>\n<p>&quot;He would've been led past the same hangman's noose where he sent people to meet their Lord,&quot; said one of the prison officials.</p>\n<p>Bashir was ousted from power in a military coup last week and was arrested, alongside other top officials, in a sweep of regime figures.</p>\n<p>Sudan's military has previously said that it would prosecute Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC), but would not extradite him.</p>\n<p>The military, which has dissolved the government, has said it would remain in power for up to two years, despite large street protests against their rule.</p>\n<p>Bashir, former Interior Minister Abdelrahim Mohamed Hussein and Ahmed Haroun, the former head of the ruling party, will be charged with corruption and the death of protesters, two sources with direct knowledge of events told CNN.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, a Ugandan foreign minister said his country would consider offering Bashir asylum.</p>\n<p>&quot;If former Sudan leader al-Bashir sought asylum in Uganda, Uganda will consider it,&quot; State Minister for Foreign Affairs in charge of International Relations, Henry Okello Oryem, told journalists after he left a parliamentary committee meeting.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Amnesty International released a statement calling on Bashir to be tried by the ICC for war crimes in Darfur.</p>\n<p>&quot;More than a decade after the first arrest warrant was issued against him in 2009, the time has come for al-Bashir to face justice at the ICC,&quot; said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty's International Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.</p>\n<p>Bashir faces five counts of crimes against humanity and two counts of war crimes at the ICC in The Hague in connection with Sudanese military actions in Darfur between 2003 and 2008.</p>\n<p>Sudan's ruling military transitional council is now facing mounting pressure from the international community to hand over power to a civilian government.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/16/africa/sudan-african-union-deadline-intl/index.html\">African Union threatened to revoke Sudan's membership</a> unless the country's military establishes civil rule within 15 days.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sudan has sought to appease demonstrators who have pressed on with marches and sit-ins. On Wednesday, the Military Transitional Council gave companies and government entities 72 hours to disclose their financial holdings in a bid to fight &quot;corruption and hold the corrupt accountable.&quot;</p>\n<p>Samson Ntale in Uganda contributed to this report.</p>",

The prison's main yard has been well-known as a site for executions.\n\"He would've been led past the same hangman's noose where he sent people to meet their Lord,\" said one of the prison officials.\nBashir was ousted from power in a military coup last week and was arrested, alongside other top officials, in a sweep of regime figures.\nSudan's military has previously said that it would prosecute Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC), but would not extradite him.\nThe military, which has dissolved the government, has said it would remain in power for up to two years, despite large street protests against their rule.\nBashir, former Interior Minister Abdelrahim Mohamed Hussein and Ahmed Haroun, the former head of the ruling party, will be charged with corruption and the death of protesters, two sources with direct knowledge of events told CNN.\nOn Tuesday, a Ugandan foreign minister said his country would consider offering Bashir asylum.\n\"If former Sudan leader al-Bashir sought asylum in Uganda, Uganda will consider it,\" State Minister for Foreign Affairs in charge of International Relations, Henry Okello Oryem, told journalists after he left a parliamentary committee meeting.\nOn Wednesday, Amnesty International released a statement calling on Bashir to be tried by the ICC for war crimes in Darfur.\n\"More than a decade after the first arrest warrant was issued against him in 2009, the time has come for al-Bashir to face justice at the ICC,\" said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty's International Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.\nBashir faces five counts of crimes against humanity and two counts of war crimes at the ICC in The Hague in connection with Sudanese military actions in Darfur between 2003 and 2008.\nSudan's ruling military transitional council is now facing mounting pressure from the international community to hand over power to a civilian government.\nOn Tuesday, the African Union threatened to revoke Sudan's membership unless the country's military establishes civil rule within 15 days.\nMeanwhile, Sudan has sought to appease demonstrators who have pressed on with marches and sit-ins. On Wednesday, the Military Transitional Council gave companies and government entities 72 hours to disclose their financial holdings in a bid to fight \"corruption and hold the corrupt accountable.\"\nSamson Ntale in Uganda contributed to this report.",

And US and other regional officials say it's Venezuela's own military and political elite who are facilitating the passage of drugs in and out of the country on hundreds of tiny, unmarked planes.</p>\n<p>A months-long CNN investigation traced the northward route of cocaine from the farmlands where much of it is grown in Colombia, and found that the number of suspected drug flights from Venezuela has risen from about two flights per week in 2017 to nearly daily in 2018, according to one US official. This year, the same official has seen as many as five nighttime flights in the sky at once.</p>\n<p>Planes loaded with Colombian cocaine used to depart from Venezuela's remote southern jungle regions. Now they take off from the country's more developed northwest region to reduce their flying time, US and regional officials also said.</p>\n<p>Officials involved in combating the deadly trade describe a ridiculously profitable courier system for the Venezuelan government. &quot;Drug smugglers are more and more exploiting the complicity of Venezuelan authorities, and more recently the vacuum of power,&quot; said one US official. Every shipment of cocaine from South America is so lucrative that the planes flown by traffickers are cheap in comparison; most are used only once and then discarded or set on fire upon arrival.</p>\n<p>A sizable fraction of the profits go to countries through which the drugs pass, from the jungles of Colombia through Venezuela and often to the Honduran coastline. A confidential 2018 US radar map of the plane routes seen by CNN shows their departure from northwestern Venezuela's Zulia region, their passage north to the Caribbean, and then their sharp turn West toward their destinations in the remote farmlands of Guatemala, on the Honduran coastline, and some in the Caribbean. From there, the drugs are shipped up to Mexico and then distributed to American cities.</p>\n<p>One US official estimated that in 2018 alone, 240 metric tons (265 tons for US readers) of cocaine crossed into Venezuela from Colombia to be flown out of the country. Other officials involved in combating the drug trade said that estimate was conservative. So much pure Colombian cocaine, when cut and distributed, could fetch around $39 billion on the streets of the US, according to an estimate by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for CNN.</p>\n<p>US officials recently expressed concern that a proposed ban by President Donald Trump on all types of aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador would create a &quot;bonanza&quot; among the Venezuelan-led traffickers, as US aid to these three Central American countries specifically targeted the cocaine trade. &quot;Right now, it's wide open,&quot; said one US law enforcement officer, &quot;then it'll just be a free for all.&quot;</p>\n<h3>Years of allegations</h3>\n<p>For years, the US has accused high-ranking Venezuelan officials of drug trafficking. Today's accelerating drug trade is a symptom of the urgent need for cash inside Venezuela's crumbling hyperinflation economy, and rampant corruption among the Maduro government's senior officials, multiple officials said. Colombian officials who would rarely be quoted on the record also said that the drug smuggling has recently involved Colombian leftist guerrilla group ELN working with the Maduro military.</p>\n<p>In 2017, former Venezuelan Vice President Tareck El Aissami was sanctioned by the US Treasury for overseeing or partially owning &quot;narcotics shipments of over 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) from Venezuela on multiple occasions.&quot; In March, El Aissami, now Venezuela's minister for industry, was indicted in New York for facilitating drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>He did not respond to the new charges, but tweeted two days after they were unsealed: &quot;LOYAL always! ANTIIMPERIALISTS always !! PATRIOTS always !! CHAVISTAS ALWAYS !! WE WILL OVERCOME!!&quot;</p>\n<p>In May 2018, Diosdado Cabello, the leader of Venezuela's National Constituent Assembly and embattled President Nicolas Maduro's number two, was also sanctioned for being &quot;directly involved in narcotics trafficking activities.&quot; He has replied there is no evidence of his involvement in trafficking, and said of sanctions against him in general: &quot;If there are persecuted politicians, those are the Venezuelan officials sanctioned by the US. You can keep your sanctions.&quot;</p>\n<p>Many other Venezuelan officials have faced similar US accusations, which the Venezuelan government has outright rejected. They did not comment for this report, despite several requests.</p>\n<p>Venezuela's scramble for cash, owing to hyperinflation caused by economic mismanagement, has led to an increase in the risks taken by pilots. Another US official said they were often former commercial airline pilots who used to fly passenger jets. &quot;Thirty planes roughly have crashed in the last three-month period, according to some reports,&quot; said one US official.</p>\n<p>The scale of the operation was confirmed by a government official in the region, who said the flights use around 50 clandestine runways in the northwestern region of Zulia in Venezuela. The drug cargo planes usually fly with the transponders that emit a signal identifying them to radar systems switched off.</p>\n<h3>Secret runways </h3>\n<p>CNN gained access with the elite Honduran military force known as Fusina to visit areas of Honduras' Moskitia region where the drug-smuggling planes from Venezuela land on secret runways.</p>\n<p>Tail-fin markings on nearly all the planes found by CNN in Moskitia show they originated in the US. The first US official told CNN that dozens of planes had been bought at US auctions by shell companies and then shipped south.</p>\n<p>Some of the planes lay damaged, rusting and exposed on the edge of makeshift former airstrips, rendered unusable by large craters created by Honduran military explosives. Others were hidden, submerged in the bend of a river, yet visible from the helicopter.</p>\n<p>Honduran military officers told CNN the traffickers had managed to reach an understanding with local fishermen on how to recover cocaine lost in accidents or interceptions by law enforcement. If a smuggler anticipates he might be caught, he throws the cocaine overboard, attached to a flotation device. Such bundles usually weigh 30 kilos (66 pounds), and fishermen are paid $150,000 if they hand them back to the cartels.</p>\n<p>While US technological assistance has helped reduce the number of illegal drug flights coming out of Colombian territory to almost zero, traffickers have an easy alternative just across the border in Venezuela. &quot;One of the problems we face is that the border area is very large,&quot; Colombian Colonel Mauricio Gonzalez told CNN. &quot;We've stopped the flights that try to depart Colombia with drugs, but narcotraffickers take advantage of the areas we cannot control.&quot;</p>\n<h3>Crossing the border</h3>\n<p>Ongoing tensions, in which Colombia has recognized Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido as its interim president, meant few Colombian officials would mention Venezuela by name. But it was clear that most of the cocaine grown in Colombia's Vichada border region is trafficked across the long, porous eastern border.</p>\n<p>The Colombian Air Force flew CNN over Vichada, to see the dozens of &quot;trochas&quot;, or tiny pathways, along which pure cocaine powder or less refined paste is trafficked. Small clearings in the forest where coca leaves are harvested, and tiny white shacks -- suspected of being cocaine laboratories -- were easy to spot.</p>\n<p>The Colombian helicopters are not allowed to fly closer than five miles to Venezuela's actual border, and stay above 2,300 feet to avoid risking the machine-gun fire of drug traffickers below. The helicopter CNN flew in dropped leaflets on the villages below, encouraging locals to respect the environment they lived in, an oblique code for turning their backs on the drug trade.</p>\n<p>Once inside Venezuela, the drugs are then whisked through military checkpoints and escorted or waved on by the army, allege US and regional officials and several Venezuelan army defectors.</p>\n<p>A defector from the Venezuelan border patrol told CNN that it was once his task to pick out trucks carrying traffickers' cocaine and ensure they passed through the border swiftly. He said this happened as often as three times a week, during the five-year period he served in the border region.</p>\n<h3>&quot;Brainwashed with food handouts&quot;</h3>\n<p>&quot;The cars that crossed with both weapons and drugs were pick-up (trucks),&quot; the defector told CNN, hiding his identity and location for fear of reprisals. &quot;We would be told the color and make of the truck, and when (it would come) -- usually at just after dawn or dusk.&quot;</p>\n<p>Speaking in hiding with his family in Colombia, he said his senior officers provided precise instructions. &quot;Everything was coordinated by the brigade commander. He'd send a lieutenant to tell you what needed to cross, and this was arranged high up above. Those who didn't agree were swapped out... Automatically.&quot;</p>\n<p>The defector described how tensions mounted in the early months of 2019, as the power struggle between Guaido and Maduro ramped up inside his border region. His unit was almost confined to barracks, but permitted to let the vital border contraband continue at pace.</p>\n<p>&quot;We were locked on the base&quot; when not on duty, he said. &quot;The general would say: 'Everyone must be with us. Leave, or speak against the government -- you'll get arrested.'&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;They had us brainwashed with food handouts,&quot; he added, referring to the subsidized food boxes that help state employees deal with the devastating impact of hyperinflation on family food purchases.</p>\n<p>&quot;One night, I couldn't take it anymore. I went home, and told my wife, 'We leave for Colombia!' My son started crying and son said: 'Dad what are we going to do?' But I knew if they stayed without me they'd be captured or interrogated.&quot; He and his family fled across the border at 3 a.m., using a route the he had noticed was being badly guarded.</p>",

                "text": "Colombia and Honduras (CNN)Cocaine trafficking from Venezuela to the United States is soaring, even as the country collapses. And US and other regional officials say it's Venezuela's own military and political elite who are facilitating the passage of drugs in and out of the country on hundreds of tiny, unmarked planes.\nA months-long CNN investigation traced the northward route of cocaine from the farmlands where much of it is grown in Colombia, and found that the number of suspected drug flights from Venezuela has risen from about two flights per week in 2017 to nearly daily in 2018, according to one US official. This year, the same official has seen as many as five nighttime flights in the sky at once.\nPlanes loaded with Colombian cocaine used to depart from Venezuela's remote southern jungle regions. Now they take off from the country's more developed northwest region to reduce their flying time, US and regional officials also said.\nOfficials involved in combating the deadly trade describe a ridiculously profitable courier system for the Venezuelan government. \"Drug smugglers are more and more exploiting the complicity of Venezuelan authorities, and more recently the vacuum of power,\" said one US official. Every shipment of cocaine from South America is so lucrative that the planes flown by traffickers are cheap in comparison; most are used only once and then discarded or set on fire upon arrival.\nA sizable fraction of the profits go to countries through which the drugs pass, from the jungles of Colombia through Venezuela and often to the Honduran coastline. A confidential 2018 US radar map of the plane routes seen by CNN shows their departure from northwestern Venezuela's Zulia region, their passage north to the Caribbean, and then their sharp turn West toward their destinations in the remote farmlands of Guatemala, on the Honduran coastline, and some in the Caribbean. From there, the drugs are shipped up to Mexico and then distributed to American cities.\nOne US official estimated that in 2018 alone, 240 metric tons (265 tons for US readers) of cocaine crossed into Venezuela from Colombia to be flown out of the country. Other officials involved in combating the drug trade said that estimate was conservative. So much pure Colombian cocaine, when cut and distributed, could fetch around $39 billion on the streets of the US, according to an estimate by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for CNN.\nUS officials recently expressed concern that a proposed ban by President Donald Trump on all types of aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador would create a \"bonanza\" among the Venezuelan-led traffickers, as US aid to these three Central American countries specifically targeted the cocaine trade. \"Right now, it's wide open,\" said one US law enforcement officer, \"then it'll just be a free for all.\"\nYears of allegations\nFor years, the US has accused high-ranking Venezuelan officials of drug trafficking. Today's accelerating drug trade is a symptom of the urgent need for cash inside Venezuela's crumbling hyperinflation economy, and rampant corruption among the Maduro government's senior officials, multiple officials said. Colombian officials who would rarely be quoted on the record also said that the drug smuggling has recently involved Colombian leftist guerrilla group ELN working with the Maduro military.\nIn 2017, former Venezuelan Vice President Tareck El Aissami was sanctioned by the US Treasury for overseeing or partially owning \"narcotics shipments of over 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) from Venezuela on multiple occasions.\" In March, El Aissami, now Venezuela's minister for industry, was indicted in New York for facilitating drug trafficking.\nHe did not respond to the new charges, but tweeted two days after they were unsealed: \"LOYAL always! ANTIIMPERIALISTS always !! PATRIOTS always !! CHAVISTAS ALWAYS !! WE WILL OVERCOME!!\"\nIn May 2018, Diosdado Cabello, the leader of Venezuela's National Constituent Assembly and embattled President Nicolas Maduro's number two, was also sanctioned for being \"directly involved in narcotics trafficking activities.\" He has replied there is no evidence of his involvement in trafficking, and said of sanctions against him in general: \"If there are persecuted politicians, those are the Venezuelan officials sanctioned by the US. You can keep your sanctions.\"\nMany other Venezuelan officials have faced similar US accusations, which the Venezuelan government has outright rejected. They did not comment for this report, despite several requests.\nVenezuela's scramble for cash, owing to hyperinflation caused by economic mismanagement, has led to an increase in the risks taken by pilots. Another US official said they were often former commercial airline pilots who used to fly passenger jets. \"Thirty planes roughly have crashed in the last three-month period, according to some reports,\" said one US official.\nThe scale of the operation was confirmed by a government official in the region, who said the flights use around 50 clandestine runways in the northwestern region of Zulia in Venezuela. The drug cargo planes usually fly with the transponders that emit a signal identifying them to radar systems switched off.\nSecret runways\nCNN gained access with the elite Honduran military force known as Fusina to visit areas of Honduras' Moskitia region where the drug-smuggling planes from Venezuela land on secret runways.\nTail-fin markings on nearly all the planes found by CNN in Moskitia show they originated in the US. The first US official told CNN that dozens of planes had been bought at US auctions by shell companies and then shipped south.\nSome of the planes lay damaged, rusting and exposed on the edge of makeshift former airstrips, rendered unusable by large craters created by Honduran military explosives. Others were hidden, submerged in the bend of a river, yet visible from the helicopter.\nHonduran military officers told CNN the traffickers had managed to reach an understanding with local fishermen on how to recover cocaine lost in accidents or interceptions by law enforcement. If a smuggler anticipates he might be caught, he throws the cocaine overboard, attached to a flotation device. Such bundles usually weigh 30 kilos (66 pounds), and fishermen are paid $150,000 if they hand them back to the cartels.\nWhile US technological assistance has helped reduce the number of illegal drug flights coming out of Colombian territory to almost zero, traffickers have an easy alternative just across the border in Venezuela. \"One of the problems we face is that the border area is very large,\" Colombian Colonel Mauricio Gonzalez told CNN. \"We've stopped the flights that try to depart Colombia with drugs, but narcotraffickers take advantage of the areas we cannot control.\"\nCrossing the border\nOngoing tensions, in which Colombia has recognized Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido as its interim president, meant few Colombian officials would mention Venezuela by name. But it was clear that most of the cocaine grown in Colombia's Vichada border region is trafficked across the long, porous eastern border.\nThe Colombian Air Force flew CNN over Vichada, to see the dozens of \"trochas\", or tiny pathways, along which pure cocaine powder or less refined paste is trafficked. Small clearings in the forest where coca leaves are harvested, and tiny white shacks -- suspected of being cocaine laboratories -- were easy to spot.\nThe Colombian helicopters are not allowed to fly closer than five miles to Venezuela's actual border, and stay above 2,300 feet to avoid risking the machine-gun fire of drug traffickers below. The helicopter CNN flew in dropped leaflets on the villages below, encouraging locals to respect the environment they lived in, an oblique code for turning their backs on the drug trade.\nOnce inside Venezuela, the drugs are then whisked through military checkpoints and escorted or waved on by the army, allege US and regional officials and several Venezuelan army defectors.\nA defector from the Venezuelan border patrol told CNN that it was once his task to pick out trucks carrying traffickers' cocaine and ensure they passed through the border swiftly. He said this happened as often as three times a week, during the five-year period he served in the border region.\n\"Brainwashed with food handouts\"\n\"The cars that crossed with both weapons and drugs were pick-up (trucks),\" the defector told CNN, hiding his identity and location for fear of reprisals. \"We would be told the color and make of the truck, and when (it would come) -- usually at just after dawn or dusk.\"\nSpeaking in hiding with his family in Colombia, he said his senior officers provided precise instructions. \"Everything was coordinated by the brigade commander. He'd send a lieutenant to tell you what needed to cross, and this was arranged high up above. Those who didn't agree were swapped out... Automatically.\"\nThe defector described how tensions mounted in the early months of 2019, as the power struggle between Guaido and Maduro ramped up inside his border region. His unit was almost confined to barracks, but permitted to let the vital border contraband continue at pace.\n\"We were locked on the base\" when not on duty, he said. \"The general would say: 'Everyone must be with us. Leave, or speak against the government -- you'll get arrested.'\"\n\"They had us brainwashed with food handouts,\" he added, referring to the subsidized food boxes that help state employees deal with the devastating impact of hyperinflation on family food purchases.\n\"One night, I couldn't take it anymore. I went home, and told my wife, 'We leave for Colombia!' My son started crying and son said: 'Dad what are we going to do?' But I knew if they stayed without me they'd be captured or interrogated.\" He and his family fled across the border at 3 a.m., using a route the he had noticed was being badly guarded.",

The girl is expected to make a full recovery, Evans said.\nSmith was in the back seat of a vehicle Saturday outside the pizza restaurant, changing the girl's diaper. The gun went off as he picked up or reached inside a diaper bag on the floorboard, Evans said after the incident.\nAfter the gun went off, the bullet traveled through Smith's leg and then the child's leg before lodging in the man's chest, Evans said.\n\"This was a tragic accident and condolences from the VHPD and VHFD go out to the family involved,\" the police department said in a release.\nCNN's Marlena Baldacci, Eliott C.

Officers forced entry into the bedroom, where they found Garcia with a wound to the head, Mor&aacute;n said.</p>\n<p>Garcia, 69, was rushed by police to a hospital in the capital Lima, where he was resuscitated three times, but doctors were ultimately unable to save him, according to the health minister.</p>\n<p>&quot;The former president made the decision to shoot himself,&quot; his lawyer Erasmo Reyna said outside the Casimiro Ulloa hospital before Garcia's death.</p>\n<p>&quot;Devastated by the death of former President Alan Garcia, I send my condolences to his family and loved ones,&quot; President Vizcarra tweeted.</p>\n<p>Garcia was accused of receiving kickbacks from one of Latin America's largest construction firms -- the Brazil-based company Odebrecht -- during the building of an electric train for the Lima metro while he was president during his second term. He has denied the claims.</p>\n<p>In his most recent tweet, posted on Tuesday, Garcia said there was &quot;no shred of evidence&quot; against him, accused Peruvian prosecutors of &quot;SPECULATION,&quot; and said he had &quot;never sold out and that is proven.&quot;</p>\n<p>In November last year, Garcia had requested asylum at the Uruguayan embassy after a judge banned him from leaving the country for 18 months. The Uruguayan government denied the request in December.</p>\n<p>Odebrecht is accused of doling out nearly $800 million in bribes between 2001 and 2016 to get contracts from governments to build roads, bridges, dams and highways.</p>\n<p>Authorities say Odebrecht officials shipped cash across the globe -- from one shell bank account to the next -- en route to politicians' pockets in a dozen countries, including Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina and Mozambique. Some of the bribes filtered through the United States.</p>\n<p>The corruption scandal -- one of the biggest in modern history -- implicated several former Latin American presidents.</p>\n<p>Last year, Peruvian President <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/21/americas/peru-president-pedro-pablo-kuczynski-resigns/index.html\">Pedro Pablo Kuczynski</a> resigned one day before the congress voted on his impeachment. He continued to deny any wrongdoing in the Odebrecht scandal.</p>\n<p>And former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/americas/brazil-luiz-incio-lula-da-silva-corruption-charges/?iid=EL\">serving a 12-year sentence</a> for corruption and money laundering, including allegedly allowing Odebrecht to pay for his family's vacation home.</p>\n<p>CNN's Rafael Romo, Mariano Castillo, Radina Gigova contributed to this report</p>",

Officers forced entry into the bedroom, where they found Garcia with a wound to the head, Mor\u00e1n said.\nGarcia, 69, was rushed by police to a hospital in the capital Lima, where he was resuscitated three times, but doctors were ultimately unable to save him, according to the health minister.\n\"The former president made the decision to shoot himself,\" his lawyer Erasmo Reyna said outside the Casimiro Ulloa hospital before Garcia's death.\n\"Devastated by the death of former President Alan Garcia, I send my condolences to his family and loved ones,\" President Vizcarra tweeted.\nGarcia was accused of receiving kickbacks from one of Latin America's largest construction firms -- the Brazil-based company Odebrecht -- during the building of an electric train for the Lima metro while he was president during his second term. He has denied the claims.\nIn his most recent tweet, posted on Tuesday, Garcia said there was \"no shred of evidence\" against him, accused Peruvian prosecutors of \"SPECULATION,\" and said he had \"never sold out and that is proven.\"\nIn November last year, Garcia had requested asylum at the Uruguayan embassy after a judge banned him from leaving the country for 18 months. The Uruguayan government denied the request in December.\nOdebrecht is accused of doling out nearly $800 million in bribes between 2001 and 2016 to get contracts from governments to build roads, bridges, dams and highways.\nAuthorities say Odebrecht officials shipped cash across the globe -- from one shell bank account to the next -- en route to politicians' pockets in a dozen countries, including Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina and Mozambique. Some of the bribes filtered through the United States.\nThe corruption scandal -- one of the biggest in modern history -- implicated several former Latin American presidents.\nLast year, Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned one day before the congress voted on his impeachment. He continued to deny any wrongdoing in the Odebrecht scandal.\nAnd former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is serving a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering, including allegedly allowing Odebrecht to pay for his family's vacation home.\nCNN's Rafael Romo, Mariano Castillo, Radina Gigova contributed to this report",

                "text": "(CNN)An Israeli flight attendant has slipped into a coma after contracting measles, according to health officials.\nThe 43-year-old woman has encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, a well-known and potentially deadly complication of the virus. She was otherwise healthy before getting measles.\n\"She's been in a deep coma for 10 days, and we're now just hoping for the best,\" said Dr. Itamar Grotto, associate director general of Israel's Ministry of Health.\nThe flight attendant, who works for El Al, the Israeli national airline, might have contracted the virus in New York, in Israel or on a flight between the two, Grotto said. Health authorities do not believed that she spread the virus to anyone on the flights.\nShe's unable to breathe on her own and on a respirator in the intensive care unit at Meir Medical Center in Kfar Saba, near Tel Aviv.\nOngoing measles outbreaks in the United States and Israel started with parents who've chosen not to vaccinate their children, according to health authorities. Authorities believe that the flight attendant was vaccinated as a child, but the vaccine isn't perfect, and in her case, it didn't work.\n\"I knew this was going to happen sooner or later,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University and an adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccines. \"We have the reintroduction of a serious viral infection with a population that's withholding the vaccine from their children, and now it's spreading beyond that population.\"\nLike many others of her generation around the world, the flight attendant, who has not been identified, received only one dose of the measles vaccine when she was a child.\nIt wasn't discovered until later that one dose is only about 93% effective. More recently -- in the United States, starting in 1989 -- children have been given two doses, which is about 97% effective, according to the CDC.\nAbout 1 out of every 1,000 children who gets measles will develop encephalitis, according to the CDC. This can lead to convulsions and leave a child deaf or with an intellectual disability.\nAdditionally, 1 or 2 out of 1,000 US children who get measles will die from it. Worldwide, the illness is fatal in 1 or 2 out of every 100 children.\nNo fatalities have been reported in the United States from measles this year or last year. In Israel, a toddler and an elderly woman died last year of the disease. In the European Union, 35 people died of the disease in 2018, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\nThere have been 3,920 cases of measles in Israel from March 2018 through April 11, said Grotto, who is also a professor of epidemiology and public health at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\nIn Europe, there were 34,383 cases of measles based on data reported to the World Health Organization from April of last year to April of this year.\nUkraine had the highest number of cases in the past 12 months, with more than 72,000, followed by Madagascar and India with more than 69,000 and 60,000 cases, respectively. WHO warned that there are delays in reporting and that this data may be incomplete.\nGrotto said there was a surge of cases in Israel last fall when large numbers of ultra-Orthodox Israelis traveled to Ukraine on a religious pilgrimage during the Jewish New Year. Ukraine has had more than 72,000 measles cases this year, more than any other country, according to the World Health Organization.\nThere's nothing in Judaism that teaches against vaccination; on the contrary, rabbis encourage vaccination in keeping with Jewish teachings on protecting your health and the health of others.\nUltra-Orthodox Jews tend to have large families, and Grotto said those who don't vaccinate tend to have practical, not ideological, reasons.\n\"Sometimes, they vaccinate their first or second child, but with so many children, they don't always have time to vaccinate them all,\" he said. \"They're not against vaccines. They have nothing against them ideologically.\"\nTo turn the tide in the outbreak, Israeli public health authorities have increased vaccine clinic hours, opened mobile clinics in religious neighborhoods and taken out ads in newspapers in religious communities.",

One logical explanation: Donald Trump has eroded our institutions and our trust in the presidency. But he may also have, perversely, increased many Americans' collective dedication to the democratic process.</p>\n<p>This move away from political apathy is evident from high office down to the municipal level. For example, the Democratic Party has a remarkably crowded field of candidates, each putting out a unique vision for America, from the socialist Bernie Sanders to the practical moderate Amy Klobuchar. Already <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/2020-democratic-presidential-candidates-list/\">10 Democrats</a> have announced their candidacy and 13 others are actively contemplating jumping in, too.</p>\n<p>Instead of deciding that Trump's America is beyond repair, it seems that every top Democrat has instead asked him or herself, &quot;What can I do?&quot; We saw this in the midterms as well, as a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/elections/women-elected-midterm-elections.html\">record number of women</a> -- 117-- ran (and won) across the country.</p>\n<p>Democrats have largely <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/10/17/in-the-2018-midterms-many-more-people-are-running-and-far-more-seats-are-contested-than-weve-seen-for-a-generation/?utm_term=.0015437519f6\">dominated this process,</a> including those challenging Republicans in the deepest red districts.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n(CNN)On Tuesday, Chicagoans are voting for mayor. New Yorkers are voting for public advocate. And in both cities, and all over the country, political races are crowded, with double-digit numbers of candidates vying for office: 14 (four of them women) for mayor of Chicago! Seventeen for New York public advocate! When was the last time you saw such a crowd reaching to become leaders in their cities?\nAnd as 2020 gets nearer, if recent history is any indication, we will likely see a huge proliferation of candidates declaring their intent to compete for seats across the country. Many of them will probably be women, as we saw demonstrated in the midterms. Perhaps records will be shattered.\nThe takeaway that is emerging: People are getting involved in their democracy because they still believe it can be a pathway to change.\nIndeed, the most exciting and telling story of America at this moment is not who's running, but how many people are throwing their hats in the ring. One logical explanation: Donald Trump has eroded our institutions and our trust in the presidency. But he may also have, perversely, increased many Americans' collective dedication to the democratic process.\nThis move away from political apathy is evident from high office down to the municipal level. For example, the Democratic Party has a remarkably crowded field of candidates, each putting out a unique vision for America, from the socialist Bernie Sanders to the practical moderate Amy Klobuchar. Already 10 Democrats have announced their candidacy and 13 others are actively contemplating jumping in, too.\nInstead of deciding that Trump's America is beyond repair, it seems that every top Democrat has instead asked him or herself, \"What can I do?\" We saw this in the midterms as well, as a record number of women -- 117-- ran (and won) across the country.\nDemocrats have largely dominated this process, including those challenging Republicans in the deepest red districts. But some Republicans are leaping in, too. There is, for example, an effort to at least get a few more Republican women to run for office, to counter the narrative (and the unfortunate reality) that the party is one by and for white men.\nThis also goes beyond candidates themselves. No candidate wins alone, and the midterms showed us enormous numbers of volunteers and new staffers who decided to get involved in politics for the first time -- again, particularly women. Canvassers broke records, using mobile apps to reach huge numbers of voters across the nation.\nThank goodness. These are difficult times, especially for progressives. It's not just that we dislike the President's politics; it's that his presidency has been a full-on assault of all we hold dear, from our laws to our norms to our institutions to the foundations of our democracy itself.\nBanning immigrants from a list of majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States was met with outrage; now it's our new normal. The President has undermined confidence in the FBI and targeted perceived critics in the CIA; he pulled a journalist's press pass for being too tough. When the political process didn't go his way, he abused his power to declare a state of emergency in order to fund a vanity project wall.\nIt's been shocking and heartbreaking to see the Republican Party allow this President to indulge his most anti-democratic impulses, concentrating power in an unstable executive and putting their own access to money and influence ahead of the good of country. The President has been pulling from the dictator's playbook and too many from his party have have aided and abetted him.\nGiven that reality, it's easy to imagine a scenario in which the rest of us just gave up. Who could blame Americans if we just threw in the towel?\nBut we haven't. Instead, so many of us have said, \"What can I do?\" Many have decided \u2014 as we see demonstrated in Chicago's mayoral race and beyond -- that electoral politics is the best route to progress.\nWhat a full-throated endorsement of the enduring strength of American democracy, and the promise of our political system. What a wonderful repudiation of the nihilism and cynicism embodied by the Trump administration.",

Stephen Lynch, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Oversight panel. &quot;The way we have it sort of walled off here, I'm not sure that may be possible.&quot;</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/michael-cohen-disbarred-in-new-york/index.html\"><img alt=\"Michael Cohen disbarred in New York\" data-demand-load=\"loaded\" data-eq-pts=\"mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781\" data-eq-state=\"mini xsmall\" data-lazy-img-observe=\"true\" data-src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226101254-01-michael-cohen-02212019-medium-plus-169.jpg\" data-src-full16x9=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226101254-01-michael-cohen-02212019-full-169.jpg\" data-src-large=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226101254-01-michael-cohen-02212019-super-169.jpg\" data-src-medium=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226101254-01-michael-cohen-02212019-exlarge-169.jpg\" data-src-mini=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226101254-01-michael-cohen-02212019-small-169.jpg\" data-src-mini1x1=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226101254-01-michael-cohen-02212019-small-11.jpg\" data-src-small=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226101254-01-michael-cohen-02212019-large-169.jpg\" data-src-xsmall=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226101254-01-michael-cohen-02212019-medium-plus-169.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226101254-01-michael-cohen-02212019-medium-plus-169.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/michael-cohen-disbarred-in-new-york/index.html\">Michael Cohen disbarred in New York</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Asked about splitting the lines of inquiries between multiple committees, Lynch added: &quot;I'm not sure that's the most effective way to do it.&quot;</p>\n<p>According to several sources familiar with a private meeting Tuesday night of committee members and staff, lawmakers engaged in a back-and-forth over whether they can pursue lines of inquiries about Trump's ties to Russia, with some noting that there are a range of Russia subjects that could be broached that would not interfere with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe.</p>\n<p>But those topics, including Cohen's admitted lies about the Trump Organization's pursuit of a Trump Tower Moscow project in the heat of the 2016 campaign, which were discussed at Tuesday's classified Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, will instead be relegated to a private hearing on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee.</p>\n<p>Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, a senior member of the Oversight panel, told CNN he asked Cummings and his staff at the Monday meeting about &quot;the rules of the road.&quot; He said he's &quot;pressing the envelope&quot; to see what lines of inquiry could be asked Wednesday on issues related to Russia.</p>\n<p>&quot;Does that mean we can't ask about Russian mob money? Russian oligarchs? The Trump Tower in Moscow that he lied about? The Russian oligarchy purchase to Trump's Florida property at a highly inflated price? The fact that Russians own apartments in Trump Tower?&quot; Connolly asked. &quot;I mean, when you say Russia, is all of that off limits? And that was really the nature of it.&quot;</p>\n<p>Connolly, who noted he's also a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, noted that for the past two years under GOP control they've little opportunity to question witnesses about Russia -- &quot;and now here's the opportunity to maybe pursue some of that.&quot;</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/michael-cohen-testimony-preview/index.html\"><img alt=\"This is Michael Cohen's moment\" data-demand-load=\"loaded\" data-eq-pts=\"mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781\" data-eq-state=\"mini xsmall\" data-lazy-img-observe=\"true\" data-src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226125043-20190226-michael-cohen-capitol-hill-medium-plus-169.jpg\" data-src-full16x9=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226125043-20190226-michael-cohen-capitol-hill-full-169.jpg\" data-src-large=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226125043-20190226-michael-cohen-capitol-hill-super-169.jpg\" data-src-medium=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226125043-20190226-michael-cohen-capitol-hill-exlarge-169.jpg\" data-src-mini=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226125043-20190226-michael-cohen-capitol-hill-small-169.jpg\" data-src-mini1x1=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226125043-20190226-michael-cohen-capitol-hill-small-11.jpg\" data-src-small=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226125043-20190226-michael-cohen-capitol-hill-large-169.jpg\" data-src-xsmall=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226125043-20190226-michael-cohen-capitol-hill-medium-plus-169.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190226125043-20190226-michael-cohen-capitol-hill-medium-plus-169.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/michael-cohen-testimony-preview/index.html\">This is Michael Cohen's moment</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Last week, Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings issued a public memo outlining the scope of the public hearing, including Trump's finances, his conflicts of interest, his foundation and his hotel as allowable topics.

                "text": "(CNN)The House Oversight Committee has instructed its Democratic members not to deviate from agreed upon lines of questioning at Michael Cohen's public hearing Wednesday, prompting grumbling from several Democrats on the panel who want to press President Donald Trump's former personal attorney about a range of matters related to Russia.\nIn a memo to Democrats obtained by CNN, the Oversight staff wrote that the committee \"wants to take great care not to inappropriately interfere with any ongoing investigation or prosecution,\" advising members to \"consult closely with Committee staff in advance about potential lines of questioning.\"\nThose areas, outlined in a nine-page memo to the Democratic staff, include a range of Trump's conflicts of interests, Trump Organization business practices as well as payments to Trump's alleged mistresses to silence their stories before the 2016 elections.\nBut they do not include a range of topics about Russia, instead leaving those matters to Thursday's classified hearing before the House Intelligence Committee, an early indication of the tension bound to grow between several powerful House committees all investigating aspects of Trump's life.\nIndeed, several Democrats on the panel told CNN that the public will get an incomplete picture if Russia topics are closed off, given that Wednesday's session will be the only public testimony Cohen will give out his of three congressional appearances this week.\n\"We want to hear about the relationship between Mr. Cohen and the President and candidate Trump, and so if he were inclined to have a lengthy discussion and an instructive discussion on, that then I'd like to have him proceed,\" said Rep. Stephen Lynch, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Oversight panel. \"The way we have it sort of walled off here, I'm not sure that may be possible.\"\nAsked about splitting the lines of inquiries between multiple committees, Lynch added: \"I'm not sure that's the most effective way to do it.\"\nAccording to several sources familiar with a private meeting Tuesday night of committee members and staff, lawmakers engaged in a back-and-forth over whether they can pursue lines of inquiries about Trump's ties to Russia, with some noting that there are a range of Russia subjects that could be broached that would not interfere with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe.\nBut those topics, including Cohen's admitted lies about the Trump Organization's pursuit of a Trump Tower Moscow project in the heat of the 2016 campaign, which were discussed at Tuesday's classified Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, will instead be relegated to a private hearing on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee.\nVirginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, a senior member of the Oversight panel, told CNN he asked Cummings and his staff at the Monday meeting about \"the rules of the road.\" He said he's \"pressing the envelope\" to see what lines of inquiry could be asked Wednesday on issues related to Russia.\n\"Does that mean we can't ask about Russian mob money? Russian oligarchs? The Trump Tower in Moscow that he lied about? The Russian oligarchy purchase to Trump's Florida property at a highly inflated price? The fact that Russians own apartments in Trump Tower?\" Connolly asked. \"I mean, when you say Russia, is all of that off limits? And that was really the nature of it.\"\nConnolly, who noted he's also a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, noted that for the past two years under GOP control they've little opportunity to question witnesses about Russia -- \"and now here's the opportunity to maybe pursue some of that.\"\nLast week, Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings issued a public memo outlining the scope of the public hearing, including Trump's finances, his conflicts of interest, his foundation and his hotel as allowable topics. But the memo did not list topics pertaining to Russia, including the Trump Tower Moscow project that Cohen negotiated.\nAn expanded version of that memo was sent this week to Democratic members, along with the instructions to stay within the scope of the hearing.\nIn his memo, Cummings said that he consulted with Mueller, the Justice Department and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, in deciding the parameters for the public hearing.\n\"The scope of the Oversight Committee's open public hearing will not include questions relating to the Intelligence Committee's investigation of efforts by Russia and other foreign entities to influence the U.S. political process during and since the 2016 U.S. election,\" the memo says.\nThe memo adds that the public hearing also won't touch \"the counterintelligence threat arising from any links or coordination between U.S. persons and the Russian government -- including any financial or other compromise or leverage foreign actors may possess over Donald Trump, his family, his business interests, or his associates.\" It goes onto say Cohen's lies to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project are not under the hearing's purview.\nAsked Tuesday about some Democratic members eager to ask Cohen about Russia, Cummings declined to discuss the matter or the scope of the hearing.\nOn Tuesday, Schiff praised Cummings handling of the public hearing and defended the decision to split the topics between the committees.\n\"I think that's a good division of labor which will allow the public to get information about the President's conduct, but will also ensure that we can get complete answers to our questions in the intelligence committee and that we also respect the equities of the Justice Department and our own investigative needs,\" Schiff told CNN.\nOne Democratic source says that the agreement struck by Schiff and Cummings shows the \"adults in the room\" were able to successfully resolve legitimate differences over the overlapping interests of the committees.\nAsked about Schiff's role, Connolly said: \"It's my understanding that he has staked out a role for the intelligence committee that largely subsumes questions about Russia.\"",

That would be yet another blow to the President, who has said he will veto the resolution if it comes to his desk.</p>\n<p>If four Republicans join all the Democrats in the Senate to pass the resolution, the measure would then face a presidential veto. The White House formally issued a veto threat on Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Congress would then need an overwhelming majority -- two-thirds of its members -- in both chambers to overrule the President. It is unlikely that there would be enough support on Capitol Hill to overturn a veto.</p>\n<p>So far, there are three Republicans who have signaled they will vote in favor of the resolution. And Senate GOP aides fully expect the resolution to pass when it is brought to the floor.</p>\n<p>&quot;As a conservative, I cannot endorse a precedent that I know future left-wing presidents will exploit to advance radical policies that will erode economic and individual freedoms,&quot; he wrote.</p>\n<p>Republican Sen. Susan Collins, a key swing vote also up for re-election in 2020, has<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/21/politics/susan-collins-trump-national-emergency-lawsuit/index.html\"> said</a> that she plans to vote in favor if it is &quot;a clean disapproval resolution.&quot;</p>\n<p>GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, another key swing vote, told reporters on Tuesday that she will vote in support of the resolution.</p>\n<p>During the recent 35-day government shutdown, the longest such federal shutdown in US history, Trump pushed Congress to appropriate $5.7 billion for physical barriers along the border with Mexico. The divided legislature rejected his proposal and the President eventually <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/14/politics/donald-trump-wall-funding-bill/index.html\">accepted its bill for $1.375 billion in border security </a>measures.</p>\n<p>But before signing the bill, Trump announced he would go around Congress to get the wall he wanted, presenting Republicans on Capitol Hill with a difficult choice. While some will support their party's leader on his top campaign issue, others argue it could set a poor precedent for future Democratic presidents to push liberal policies without congressional input.</p>\n<p>Republican leadership is not worried or up-in-arms right now about the state of play on the resolution, however, because they don't view this as a fight to block the resolution. They view it as a fight to make sure it stays below a veto-proof threshold and they appear on track for that now.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; the California Republican said when CNN asked if they'd have the votes to deny a veto-proof majority. &quot;If you read what the Democrats ... say, (that) the emergency is over -- no, it's not.&quot;</p>\n<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday that he expects the Senate will vote on the resolution before the next Senate recess, which will take place the week of March 18.</p>\n<p>McConnell said that GOP senators had a &quot;fulsome discussion&quot; at their afternoon policy lunch about the &quot;legality and appropriateness&quot; of the emergency declaration. The lunch was attended by Vice President Mike Pence and a lawyer from the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>The Republican leader said he hasn't &quot;reached a total conclusion&quot; about whether he believes the President's emergency declaration is legal.</p>\n<p>The President has been putting public pressure on Republicans over border security and has urged them not to side with Democrats.</p>\n<p>&quot;I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,&quot; the President <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1100017237228949506\">tweeted</a> on Monday. &quot;Without strong Borders, we don't have a Country - and the voters are on board with us.

                "text": "(CNN)The House on Tuesday rebuked President Donald Trump over one of his signature issues, passing a resolution to overturn his emergency declaration to unlock money for wall construction at the US southern border.\nThe resolution will next be taken up by the Senate, where it will put Republican unity to the test, though Senate leaders have signaled they will not bring it to a vote immediately.\nIt is not yet clear how many Republicans will vote for the resolution in the Senate, but it looks likely to pass the upper chamber, despite the fact that Republicans hold a majority. That would be yet another blow to the President, who has said he will veto the resolution if it comes to his desk.\nIf four Republicans join all the Democrats in the Senate to pass the resolution, the measure would then face a presidential veto. The White House formally issued a veto threat on Tuesday afternoon.\nCongress would then need an overwhelming majority -- two-thirds of its members -- in both chambers to overrule the President. It is unlikely that there would be enough support on Capitol Hill to overturn a veto.\nSo far, there are three Republicans who have signaled they will vote in favor of the resolution. And Senate GOP aides fully expect the resolution to pass when it is brought to the floor.\n\"As a conservative, I cannot endorse a precedent that I know future left-wing presidents will exploit to advance radical policies that will erode economic and individual freedoms,\" he wrote.\nRepublican Sen. Susan Collins, a key swing vote also up for re-election in 2020, has said that she plans to vote in favor if it is \"a clean disapproval resolution.\"\nGOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, another key swing vote, told reporters on Tuesday that she will vote in support of the resolution.\nDuring the recent 35-day government shutdown, the longest such federal shutdown in US history, Trump pushed Congress to appropriate $5.7 billion for physical barriers along the border with Mexico. The divided legislature rejected his proposal and the President eventually accepted its bill for $1.375 billion in border security measures.\nBut before signing the bill, Trump announced he would go around Congress to get the wall he wanted, presenting Republicans on Capitol Hill with a difficult choice. While some will support their party's leader on his top campaign issue, others argue it could set a poor precedent for future Democratic presidents to push liberal policies without congressional input.\nRepublican leadership is not worried or up-in-arms right now about the state of play on the resolution, however, because they don't view this as a fight to block the resolution. They view it as a fight to make sure it stays below a veto-proof threshold and they appear on track for that now.\n\"Yes,\" the California Republican said when CNN asked if they'd have the votes to deny a veto-proof majority. \"If you read what the Democrats ... say, (that) the emergency is over -- no, it's not.\"\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday that he expects the Senate will vote on the resolution before the next Senate recess, which will take place the week of March 18.\nMcConnell said that GOP senators had a \"fulsome discussion\" at their afternoon policy lunch about the \"legality and appropriateness\" of the emergency declaration. The lunch was attended by Vice President Mike Pence and a lawyer from the Justice Department.\nThe Republican leader said he hasn't \"reached a total conclusion\" about whether he believes the President's emergency declaration is legal.\nThe President has been putting public pressure on Republicans over border security and has urged them not to side with Democrats.\n\"I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,\" the President tweeted on Monday. \"Without strong Borders, we don't have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don't fall into the Democrats 'trap' of Open Borders and Crime!\"\nAs of Tuesday morning, many Republican senators said they were still undecided about how they will vote on the resolution.\nSen. Martha McSally, a Republican from the border state of Arizona, and Sen. Pat Toomey, a conservative from Pennsylvania, told CNN they were still looking at their options.\nRepublican Sens. Tim Scott of South Carolina and David Perdue of Georgia said they planned to vote with the President against a resolution of disapproval.\nRepublican Sen. Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee, told CNN on Monday he does not support the President's emergency declaration, but would review the resolution of disapproval before deciding how he'd vote.\n\"I think it is unnecessary, unwise and inconsistent with the Constitution,\" said Alexander of the declaration. \"And I feel strongly about that.\"\nCNN's Phil Mattingly, Pamela Brown, Lauren Fox, Ted Barrett, Manu Raju, Mike Conte and Katie Bernard contributed to this report.",

The justices will have a chance to explain when the government can display religious symbols on public land and clarify the court's somewhat muddled precedent on the issue.</p>\n<p>The American Legion built the so-called &quot;Peace Cross&quot; in 1925 to honor 49 local men who died serving in World War I. Mothers of the fallen soldiers designed the memorial to mirror the crosses that mark graves in American cemeteries overseas.</p>\n<p>&quot;This Memorial Cross Dedicated to the Heroes Of Prince George's County who gave their lives in the great war for the liberty of the world,&quot; a plaque reads.</p>\n<p>The cross was deeded to the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1961, after a highway was built around it. It stood without conflict until 2012, when nearby residents sued, arguing that they are offended by the government's endorsement of religion and the fact that the cross is maintained with taxpayer money.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/22/politics/clarence-thomas-supreme-court/index.html\"><img alt=\"Is Clarence Thomas headed out or just getting started?\" data-demand-load=\"loaded\" data-eq-pts=\"mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781\" data-eq-state=\"mini xsmall\" data-lazy-img-observe=\"true\" data-src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221125641-02-justice-clarence-thomas-medium-plus-169.jpg\" data-src-full16x9=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221125641-02-justice-clarence-thomas-full-169.jpg\" data-src-large=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221125641-02-justice-clarence-thomas-super-169.jpg\" data-src-medium=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221125641-02-justice-clarence-thomas-exlarge-169.jpg\" data-src-mini=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221125641-02-justice-clarence-thomas-small-169.jpg\" data-src-mini1x1=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221125641-02-justice-clarence-thomas-small-11.jpg\" data-src-small=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221125641-02-justice-clarence-thomas-large-169.jpg\" data-src-xsmall=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221125641-02-justice-clarence-thomas-medium-plus-169.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221125641-02-justice-clarence-thomas-medium-plus-169.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/22/politics/clarence-thomas-supreme-court/index.html\">Is Clarence Thomas headed out or just getting started?</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The fate of the cross that is illuminated at night and hosts annual Veterans Day and Memorial Day celebrations has divided the community.</p>\n<p>Last week, when two of the plaintiffs stood for an interview in front of the cross explaining their position, cars whizzed by and one driver stuck his head out the window yelling, &quot;Save the cross!&quot; as he careened around the intersection.</p>\n<p>&quot;As a memorial to all veterans, it only seems to represent -- the cross -- Christian veterans,&quot; Lowe told CNN in an interview.</p>\n<p>&quot;I'm not offended by the cross per se. What offends me is that it's on government land promoting government endorsement of religion, and it's not my religion,&quot; Edwords said.</p>\n<p>&quot;But even if it were my religion, I would not want my tax dollars used to endorse it,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>They lost when a district court upheld the cross. But in 2017, a panel of judges on the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to reverse the decision, saying that the government had &quot;excessively entangled itself with religion.&quot;</p>\n<p>In arguments before the Supreme Court, lawyers for the men argue the memorial should either be moved to private property or modified.</p>\n<p>But removing the arms of the cross amounts to disfigurement, lawyers for the American Legion argue.</p>\n<p>&quot;That would be an absolute desecration for the gravestone of 49 men who died defending our freedom -- under no circumstance can that be permitted,&quot; said Jeremy Dys, general counsel of the First Liberty Institute, a group representing the American Legion.</p>\n<p>&quot;Defacing it by taking the arms off or anything of that nature -- it's just a slap in the face for veterans,&quot; Shaw said.</p>\n<p>&quot;I don't see how a static cross can coerce anybody into a state religion,&quot; said Moore.</p>\n<p>&quot;Where will this end?&quot; he asked. He said he is concerned that if they lose in court it will end by people trying to &quot;take down every reference to God, every cross in every memorial that exists in the country.&quot;</p>\n<p>Indeed 84 House and Senate lawmakers have filed a brief in support of the American Legion, arguing that if the court rules against them in the case it could impact other crosses such as two that stand in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. One is the 13-foot-tall Latin cross called the Argonne Cross, dedicated in 1923 to the &quot;memory of our men in France,&quot; and another is the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, which stands 24 feet tall and was donated by the Canadian government to honor Americans who died in war.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration supports the American Legion and urges the justices to take a historical approach to the case. &quot;History shows that the Framers understood the Establishment Clause as prohibiting the coercion of religious belief or adherence, but not the acknowledgement of religion in public life,&quot; Principal Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall argued in briefs.</p>\n<p>He said that &quot;passive displays&quot; like the Peace Cross fall on the &quot;permissible side&quot; of the line</p>\n<p>because they &quot;typically do not compel religious belief; coerce support for, or participation in, any particular religion or its exercise; or represent an effort to proselytize or denigrate any particular faith.&quot;</p>\n<p>On the other side is a friend of the court brief filed by the Freedom from Religion Foundation and other groups that advance the rights of atheists, agnostics and nonbelievers.</p>\n<p>They argue that when the government selects a single religion's symbol to remember war heroes it &quot;stigmatizes, marginalizes and diminishes those citizens who exercise their constitutional right not to believe or practice the endorsed religion or any religion.&quot;</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court heard a similar case back in 2005 concerning the Ten Commandments. The court allowed a Ten Commandments monument that stood in a Texas public park, but it struck down a similar display in two Kentucky county courthouses.</p>\n<p>The justices could issue a broad ruling that would cover all religious symbols, or they could confine their opinion around the specifics of the Peace Cross.</p>\n<p>Two constitutional lawyers, Walter Dellinger and Martin S. Lederman, suggest in another friend of the court brief that there are &quot;discrete contexts&quot; when the government's display of religious symbols does not violate the Establishment Clause. That includes a symbol on a headstone that corresponds to the deceased's religion, or the Peace Cross.</p>\n<p>The lawyers argue the &quot;idiosyncratic characteristic&quot; of the cross is that the 49 men memorialized were likely all Christian. That would mean that the cross can be seen &quot;not as religious expression of the state itself,&quot; but instead &quot;a respectful representation of a fact about the religion of those being honored -- something the Establishment Clause generally does not prohibit.&quot;</p>",

                "text": "Bladensburg, Maryland (CNN)The fate of a 40-foot-tall cross built almost a century ago to honor World War I veterans is at the center of a separation of church and state dispute at the Supreme Court Wednesday.\nHow the court rules could impact similar memorials in towns across the country and even Arlington National Cemetery. The justices will have a chance to explain when the government can display religious symbols on public land and clarify the court's somewhat muddled precedent on the issue.\nThe American Legion built the so-called \"Peace Cross\" in 1925 to honor 49 local men who died serving in World War I. Mothers of the fallen soldiers designed the memorial to mirror the crosses that mark graves in American cemeteries overseas.\n\"This Memorial Cross Dedicated to the Heroes Of Prince George's County who gave their lives in the great war for the liberty of the world,\" a plaque reads.\nThe cross was deeded to the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1961, after a highway was built around it. It stood without conflict until 2012, when nearby residents sued, arguing that they are offended by the government's endorsement of religion and the fact that the cross is maintained with taxpayer money.\nThe fate of the cross that is illuminated at night and hosts annual Veterans Day and Memorial Day celebrations has divided the community.\nLast week, when two of the plaintiffs stood for an interview in front of the cross explaining their position, cars whizzed by and one driver stuck his head out the window yelling, \"Save the cross!\" as he careened around the intersection.\n\"As a memorial to all veterans, it only seems to represent -- the cross -- Christian veterans,\" Lowe told CNN in an interview.\n\"I'm not offended by the cross per se. What offends me is that it's on government land promoting government endorsement of religion, and it's not my religion,\" Edwords said.\n\"But even if it were my religion, I would not want my tax dollars used to endorse it,\" he said.\nThey lost when a district court upheld the cross. But in 2017, a panel of judges on the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to reverse the decision, saying that the government had \"excessively entangled itself with religion.\"\nIn arguments before the Supreme Court, lawyers for the men argue the memorial should either be moved to private property or modified.\nBut removing the arms of the cross amounts to disfigurement, lawyers for the American Legion argue.\n\"That would be an absolute desecration for the gravestone of 49 men who died defending our freedom -- under no circumstance can that be permitted,\" said Jeremy Dys, general counsel of the First Liberty Institute, a group representing the American Legion.\n\"Defacing it by taking the arms off or anything of that nature -- it's just a slap in the face for veterans,\" Shaw said.\n\"I don't see how a static cross can coerce anybody into a state religion,\" said Moore.\n\"Where will this end?\" he asked. He said he is concerned that if they lose in court it will end by people trying to \"take down every reference to God, every cross in every memorial that exists in the country.\"\nIndeed 84 House and Senate lawmakers have filed a brief in support of the American Legion, arguing that if the court rules against them in the case it could impact other crosses such as two that stand in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. One is the 13-foot-tall Latin cross called the Argonne Cross, dedicated in 1923 to the \"memory of our men in France,\" and another is the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, which stands 24 feet tall and was donated by the Canadian government to honor Americans who died in war.\nThe Trump administration supports the American Legion and urges the justices to take a historical approach to the case. \"History shows that the Framers understood the Establishment Clause as prohibiting the coercion of religious belief or adherence, but not the acknowledgement of religion in public life,\" Principal Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall argued in briefs.\nHe said that \"passive displays\" like the Peace Cross fall on the \"permissible side\" of the line\nbecause they \"typically do not compel religious belief; coerce support for, or participation in, any particular religion or its exercise; or represent an effort to proselytize or denigrate any particular faith.\"\nOn the other side is a friend of the court brief filed by the Freedom from Religion Foundation and other groups that advance the rights of atheists, agnostics and nonbelievers.\nThey argue that when the government selects a single religion's symbol to remember war heroes it \"stigmatizes, marginalizes and diminishes those citizens who exercise their constitutional right not to believe or practice the endorsed religion or any religion.\"\nThe Supreme Court heard a similar case back in 2005 concerning the Ten Commandments. The court allowed a Ten Commandments monument that stood in a Texas public park, but it struck down a similar display in two Kentucky county courthouses.\nThe justices could issue a broad ruling that would cover all religious symbols, or they could confine their opinion around the specifics of the Peace Cross.\nTwo constitutional lawyers, Walter Dellinger and Martin S. Lederman, suggest in another friend of the court brief that there are \"discrete contexts\" when the government's display of religious symbols does not violate the Establishment Clause. That includes a symbol on a headstone that corresponds to the deceased's religion, or the Peace Cross.\nThe lawyers argue the \"idiosyncratic characteristic\" of the cross is that the 49 men memorialized were likely all Christian. That would mean that the cross can be seen \"not as religious expression of the state itself,\" but instead \"a respectful representation of a fact about the religion of those being honored -- something the Establishment Clause generally does not prohibit.\"",

The reference in Jay Neveloff's bio was removed on Friday to avoid confusion,&quot; said Jennifer Manton of Kramer Levin. She added that no lawyer at the firm is currently working on any Trump-affiliated matter.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Rep. Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican who's the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote a letter addressed to Paul Pearlman, Kramer Levin's managing partner, echoing the concerns raised by the Trump Organization about an alleged conflict of interest and questioning changes to the firm's website. The letter cited the same example included in the Trump Organization's statement.</p>\n<p>&quot;I hope your firm is not intentionally trying to downplay its longstanding ties to The Trump Organization -- and actively changing its website in real-time -- simply because one of your firm's partners, Mr. (Barry) Berke, is now in a position to use the awesome powers of the United States Congress to investigate one of your firm's leading clients,&quot; Collins' letter reads.</p>\n<p>Collins asked for information about Berke's salary, internal conflict checks and all references to Trump that were removed from the website.</p>\n<p>Multiple congressional committees have requested information from the Trump Organization in the past, and now with Democrats in control of the House members of several committees, including Oversight and Intelligence, have said they intend to dig into the Trump Organization. The House Oversight Committee in January asked the Trump Organization to turn over records relating to hush money payments made to silence women alleging affairs with Donald Trump before he became President. Trump has denied having affairs with the women. Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, is testifying before the committee Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The new round of letters and statements comes after the Trump Organization told the House Oversight Committee on Friday that it would not respond to document requests because the House Judiciary Committee had hired Berke, which it said created a conflict of interest. Berke co-authorized think tank treatises in 2017 and 2018 outlining what they see as a case for impeaching or indicting Trump on charges of obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p>It was the second rebuff by the Trump Organization, which previously told the Oversight Committee it wouldn't comply with the request because it had already provided information toauthorities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/12/politics/house-judiciary-committee-hires-lawyers-impeachment/index.html3\">The Judiciary Committee announced earlier this month</a> that it was hiring Berke, a high-powered criminal defense attorney, as special oversight counsel for the committee, where he will help craft the panel's plans to investigate the President and his administration.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Trump Organization attorney Alan Futerfas sent a letter to Rep. Jerry Nadler, the New York Democrat who chairs the Judiciary Committee, asking him to cease the investigation into Trump Organization for now because of the alleged conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>Kramer Levin responded on Monday, saying, &quot;For the past several years the firm's work has involved only minor tasks for single purpose companies, such as pro forma amendments to condominium offering plans that date back more than a decade or the clearing up of minor building violations for management companies.&quot;</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the Trump Organization called Kramer Levin's claims &quot;false, as the many press releases issued by Kramer Levin concerning their work for us (to say nothing of the invoices we have paid) attest. The firm's work for us is in no way pro forma or 'ministerial.' It arises from a thirty-year relationship rooted in complex real estate matters.&quot;</p>",

                "text": "(CNN)The Trump Organization has accused a law firm of removing references about its long-term relationship with the company from its website as the organization alleges a conflict of interest over a lawyer from the firm working for a House committee that's investigating the President's company.\nIn a new statement Monday, the Trump Organization said that until Friday, New York law firm Kramer Levin had boasted on its website of its 25-year relationship with the real estate firm, saying it advised on \"innumerable real estate deals, including Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street, Trump Palace, Trump International in New York and Chicago, the GM building, the Plaza Hotel and numerous other matters.\" The Trump Organization said the description had been scrubbed from Kramer Levin real estate partner Jay Neveloff's biography.\nA spokeswoman for Kramer Levin confirmed the description had been removed. \"It is common practice to list prior representative experience in lawyer biographies on the website. The reference in Jay Neveloff's bio was removed on Friday to avoid confusion,\" said Jennifer Manton of Kramer Levin. She added that no lawyer at the firm is currently working on any Trump-affiliated matter.\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican who's the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote a letter addressed to Paul Pearlman, Kramer Levin's managing partner, echoing the concerns raised by the Trump Organization about an alleged conflict of interest and questioning changes to the firm's website. The letter cited the same example included in the Trump Organization's statement.\n\"I hope your firm is not intentionally trying to downplay its longstanding ties to The Trump Organization -- and actively changing its website in real-time -- simply because one of your firm's partners, Mr. (Barry) Berke, is now in a position to use the awesome powers of the United States Congress to investigate one of your firm's leading clients,\" Collins' letter reads.\nCollins asked for information about Berke's salary, internal conflict checks and all references to Trump that were removed from the website.\nMultiple congressional committees have requested information from the Trump Organization in the past, and now with Democrats in control of the House members of several committees, including Oversight and Intelligence, have said they intend to dig into the Trump Organization. The House Oversight Committee in January asked the Trump Organization to turn over records relating to hush money payments made to silence women alleging affairs with Donald Trump before he became President. Trump has denied having affairs with the women. Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, is testifying before the committee Wednesday.\nThe new round of letters and statements comes after the Trump Organization told the House Oversight Committee on Friday that it would not respond to document requests because the House Judiciary Committee had hired Berke, which it said created a conflict of interest. Berke co-authorized think tank treatises in 2017 and 2018 outlining what they see as a case for impeaching or indicting Trump on charges of obstruction of justice.\nIt was the second rebuff by the Trump Organization, which previously told the Oversight Committee it wouldn't comply with the request because it had already provided information toauthorities.\nThe Judiciary Committee announced earlier this month that it was hiring Berke, a high-powered criminal defense attorney, as special oversight counsel for the committee, where he will help craft the panel's plans to investigate the President and his administration.\nOn Monday, Trump Organization attorney Alan Futerfas sent a letter to Rep. Jerry Nadler, the New York Democrat who chairs the Judiciary Committee, asking him to cease the investigation into Trump Organization for now because of the alleged conflict of interest.\nKramer Levin responded on Monday, saying, \"For the past several years the firm's work has involved only minor tasks for single purpose companies, such as pro forma amendments to condominium offering plans that date back more than a decade or the clearing up of minor building violations for management companies.\"\nOn Tuesday, the Trump Organization called Kramer Levin's claims \"false, as the many press releases issued by Kramer Levin concerning their work for us (to say nothing of the invoices we have paid) attest. The firm's work for us is in no way pro forma or 'ministerial.' It arises from a thirty-year relationship rooted in complex real estate matters.\"",

Cohen also said the President's personal lawyers &quot;reviewed and edited&quot; his 2017 statements when Cohen lied to Congress about the Trump Organization's pursuit of a massive project in Moscow.</p>\n<p>The special counsel indictment of Roger Stone made no mention of direct contact between Stone and Assange.</p>\n<p>Stone -- who has been indicted on charges of making false statements, witness tampering and obstructing justice -- has denied discussing the matter with Trump or having any such interactions with WikiLeaks. He is fighting his charges in court.</p>\n<p>Cohen's opening statement also suggests that Trump may have been aware in advance of a 2016 meeting set up by Donald Trump Jr. and Russians at Trump Tower -- something that Trump and his eldest son have long denied. Cohen will tell Congress that he witnessed Trump Jr., in June 2016, tell his father: &quot;The meeting is all set.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen acknowledges not knowing for sure that Trump's son's comments were in reference to the meeting with Russians.</p>\n<p>&quot;I also knew that nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr. Trump's knowledge and approval,&quot; Cohen will say. &quot;So I concluded that Don Jr. was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary.&quot;</p>\n<p>CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/26/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-june-2016-meeting-knowledge/index.html\">reported</a> in July 2018 that Cohen was willing to testify to the special counsel that Trump knew in advance about the planned meeting at Trump Tower.</p>\n<p>The White House has attacked Cohen's credibility, calling him someone who cannot be trusted given he has already pleaded guilty to lying.</p>\n<p>When asked for comment on Cohen's prepared testimony, the White House referred to press secretary Sarah Sanders' Tuesday statement on Cohen's testimony.</p>\n<p>&quot;Disgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements,&quot; Sanders said in that statement. &quot;Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same. It's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.&quot;</p>\n<p>According to a copy of the opening statement he prepares to deliver to the House Oversight Committee Wednesday, Cohen says Trump lied repeatedly about a number of matters -- and made a host of racist statements.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/cohen-house-oversight-committee-russia/index.html\"><img alt=\"House panel to Dems: Russia off limits in Cohen's public hearing\" data-demand-load=\"loaded\" data-eq-pts=\"mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781\" data-eq-state=\"mini xsmall\" data-lazy-img-observe=\"true\" data-src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190110122620-elijah-cummings-michael-cohen-split-medium-plus-169.jpg\" data-src-full16x9=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190110122620-elijah-cummings-michael-cohen-split-full-169.jpg\" data-src-large=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190110122620-elijah-cummings-michael-cohen-split-super-169.jpg\" data-src-medium=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190110122620-elijah-cummings-michael-cohen-split-exlarge-169.jpg\" data-src-mini=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190110122620-elijah-cummings-michael-cohen-split-small-169.jpg\" data-src-mini1x1=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190110122620-elijah-cummings-michael-cohen-split-small-11.jpg\" data-src-small=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190110122620-elijah-cummings-michael-cohen-split-large-169.jpg\" data-src-xsmall=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190110122620-elijah-cummings-michael-cohen-split-medium-plus-169.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190110122620-elijah-cummings-michael-cohen-split-medium-plus-169.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/26/politics/cohen-house-oversight-committee-russia/index.html\">House panel to Dems: Russia off limits in Cohen's public hearing</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>&quot;To be clear, Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Tower negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,&quot; Cohen will tell the committee. &quot;He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen says that Trump did not &quot;directly&quot; tell him to lie to Congress. &quot;That's not how he operates,&quot; Cohen says.</p>\n<p>But he says that Trump would tell him and the public he has &quot;no business&quot; with Russia, even as he was negotiating the Moscow project.</p>\n<p>Cohen also says he's providing the panel with several documents to back up his allegations, including a check Trump wrote from his bank account to reimburse him for hush money payments to silence Stormy Daniels' story in 2016 about her alleged affair with Trump. Trump denies having an affair with Daniels.</p>\n<p>But in the testimony, Cohen recounts how he was visiting Trump in February 2017 in the White House when the President assured him his reimbursement checks were coming in the mail. He said Trump made 11 payments of $35,000 each to reimburse him in the hush-money scheme, saying he's providing the House panel with a copy of an August 2017 check signed by the President from his personal bank account.</p>\n<p>&quot;The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws,&quot; Cohen will say.</p>\n<p>Cohen also says he's providing the committee with copies of letters he wrote threatening Trump's high school, college and the College Board not to release his grades or test scores.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Cohen says he has documentation showing Trump arranging a bidder at an auction to purchase a portrait of himself, which he later reimbursed the bidder for from his charitable organization.</p>\n<p>And he provides information about Trump's decision to avoid serving in the Vietnam War. Cohen was directed to avoid answering reporters' questions about the matter, he will say. Trump, who has long claimed his deferment was due to a bone spur, had no medical records to provide because there was no surgery, Cohen said.</p>\n<p>In jarring testimony, Cohen also says Trump repeatedly made racist comments about African-Americans. While driving through a poor neighborhood in Chicago, Trump allegedly told Cohen that &quot;only black people could live that way.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen added that Trump said that African-Americans &quot;would never vote for him because they were too stupid.&quot;</p>",

                "text": "(CNN)Donald Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen is prepared to testify that Trump was aware of longtime adviser Roger Stone's efforts to reach out to WikiLeaks in advance of its release of damaging information about Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, according to a copy of his public testimony submitted to Congress and obtained by CNN.\nIn a stunning 20-page statement provided Tuesday night to lawmakers, Cohen details a wide range of allegations against Trump -- from making racist comments about African-Americans to participating during his presidency in an illegal hush-money scheme to keep his alleged extramarital affairs quiet -- as well as suggesting Trump faked a medical condition to get out of serving in the Vietnam War.\nAnd Cohen will provide new details saying Trump was engaged in an aggressive pursuit of a major project in Russia in 2016, alleging the President's attorneys edited Cohen's 2017 testimony when he lied to Congress, downplaying the efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.\nHe says Trump never directly ordered him to lie to Congress but he believed he was carrying out an order given his interactions with Trump, who was making public statements about not having any business dealings with Russia.\nIn the testimony, Cohen will allege that, in 2016, he witnessed Trump taking a phone call from Stone, who was on speakerphone.\n\"Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign,\" Cohen will say, according to his prepared testimony.\nCohen's allegations, if true, would amount to the first time anyone with direct knowledge has said that the President had advance knowledge of the WikiLeaks dump of Clinton emails. Cohen also said the President's personal lawyers \"reviewed and edited\" his 2017 statements when Cohen lied to Congress about the Trump Organization's pursuit of a massive project in Moscow.\nThe special counsel indictment of Roger Stone made no mention of direct contact between Stone and Assange.\nStone -- who has been indicted on charges of making false statements, witness tampering and obstructing justice -- has denied discussing the matter with Trump or having any such interactions with WikiLeaks. He is fighting his charges in court.\nCohen's opening statement also suggests that Trump may have been aware in advance of a 2016 meeting set up by Donald Trump Jr. and Russians at Trump Tower -- something that Trump and his eldest son have long denied. Cohen will tell Congress that he witnessed Trump Jr., in June 2016, tell his father: \"The meeting is all set.\"\nCohen acknowledges not knowing for sure that Trump's son's comments were in reference to the meeting with Russians.\n\"I also knew that nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr. Trump's knowledge and approval,\" Cohen will say. \"So I concluded that Don Jr. was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary.\"\nCNN reported in July 2018 that Cohen was willing to testify to the special counsel that Trump knew in advance about the planned meeting at Trump Tower.\nThe White House has attacked Cohen's credibility, calling him someone who cannot be trusted given he has already pleaded guilty to lying.\nWhen asked for comment on Cohen's prepared testimony, the White House referred to press secretary Sarah Sanders' Tuesday statement on Cohen's testimony.\n\"Disgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements,\" Sanders said in that statement. \"Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same. It's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.\"\nAccording to a copy of the opening statement he prepares to deliver to the House Oversight Committee Wednesday, Cohen says Trump lied repeatedly about a number of matters -- and made a host of racist statements.\n\"To be clear, Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Tower negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,\" Cohen will tell the committee. \"He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.\"\nCohen says that Trump did not \"directly\" tell him to lie to Congress. \"That's not how he operates,\" Cohen says.\nBut he says that Trump would tell him and the public he has \"no business\" with Russia, even as he was negotiating the Moscow project.\nCohen also says he's providing the panel with several documents to back up his allegations, including a check Trump wrote from his bank account to reimburse him for hush money payments to silence Stormy Daniels' story in 2016 about her alleged affair with Trump. Trump denies having an affair with Daniels.\nBut in the testimony, Cohen recounts how he was visiting Trump in February 2017 in the White House when the President assured him his reimbursement checks were coming in the mail. He said Trump made 11 payments of $35,000 each to reimburse him in the hush-money scheme, saying he's providing the House panel with a copy of an August 2017 check signed by the President from his personal bank account.\n\"The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws,\" Cohen will say.\nCohen also says he's providing the committee with copies of letters he wrote threatening Trump's high school, college and the College Board not to release his grades or test scores.\nMoreover, Cohen says he has documentation showing Trump arranging a bidder at an auction to purchase a portrait of himself, which he later reimbursed the bidder for from his charitable organization.\nAnd he provides information about Trump's decision to avoid serving in the Vietnam War. Cohen was directed to avoid answering reporters' questions about the matter, he will say. Trump, who has long claimed his deferment was due to a bone spur, had no medical records to provide because there was no surgery, Cohen said.\nIn jarring testimony, Cohen also says Trump repeatedly made racist comments about African-Americans. While driving through a poor neighborhood in Chicago, Trump allegedly told Cohen that \"only black people could live that way.\"\nCohen added that Trump said that African-Americans \"would never vote for him because they were too stupid.\"",

                "text": "(CNN)Lori Lightfoot and Toni Preckwinkle have emerged from a crowded field of candidates to move on to a runoff in Chicago's mayoral race, meaning the Windy City will elect its first black woman mayor in city history this spring.\nThe two will meet in a runoff set for April 2, according to CNN affiliate WBBM. The winner will replace Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who decided against running for re-election.\nLightfoot, a former assistant US Attorney, describes herself as \"an out and proud black lesbian\" and has made reforming the police department a bedrock of her campaign.\nIn the wake of the Laquan McDonald scandal -- in which a white police officer Jason Van Dyke shot the black teenager 16 times as he walked away from police -- Lightfoot was appointed by Emanuel to head the newly created police accountability task force.\nPreckwinkle is the Cook County Board president and has made education and a $15 minimum wage focal points of her campaign.\nShe had been considered a frontrunner. However, a recent Chicago Tribune report put Preckwinkle on the defensive. The report claimed that Preckwinkle hired the son of a powerful old-school alderman, Ed Burke, to a $100,000 a year job with the county. Burke was recently charged with attempted extortion after the FBI raided his offices in January.\nThe winner will become the second woman and the second African American elected Chicago's mayor, according to the Chicago Public Library. Jane Byrne was elected in 1979, and Harold Washington was elected in 1983.\nEugene Sawyer, a black man, also served as acting mayor of the city for two years.\n\"As much as I love this job and will always love this city and its residents, I've decided not to seek re-election,\" Emanuel said. \"This has been the job of a lifetime, but it is not a job for a lifetime.\"\nThe Board of Election Commissioners reported a turnout of 32.84% with 95% of precincts reporting. According to WBBM, the previous record for worst municipal election turnout in Chicago was in 2007 with 33%.\nCNN's Amir Vera and Bill Kirkos contributed to this report.",

If you've never been, go,\" Colbert said. \"The people there are unbelievably kind and welcoming.\n\"Obviously we're not going to go down now, but we hope to go down in the future. And again, we want to say to everyone down there how sad and heartbroken we are for what that country is going through.\"\nColbert had planned the trip after New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern appeared on his show last September and invited him to her country to be made an honorary citizen of Hobbiton, the set used in the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies.",

She weeps as she remembers the one that was hardest to read.</p>\n<p>&quot;The ones that said this was a fake story. That he wasn't real.

                "text": "The attacks were from those who oppose vaccination, and this mother, who lives in the Midwest, doesn't want her name used for fear the attention would only encourage more messages.\nInterviews with mothers who've lost children and with those who spy on anti-vaccination groups, reveal a tactic employed by anti-vaxers: When a child dies, members of the group sometimes encourage each other to go on that parent's Facebook page. The anti-vaxers then post messages telling the parents they're lying and their child never existed, or that the parent murdered them, or that vaccines killed the child, or some combination of all of those.\nNothing is considered too cruel. Just days after their children died, mothers say anti-vaxers on social media called them whores, the c-word and baby killers.\nJill Promoli, who lives outside Toronto, lost her son to flu. She believes the anti-vaxers are trying to silence the very people who can make the strongest argument for vaccinations: those whose children died of vaccine-preventable illnesses.\nFlu took the life of Promoli's 2-year-old son, Jude McGee, three years ago. She's since started a campaign in his name for flu prevention, including vaccination.\n\"I know that these people are really trying to hurt me, and I understand that the reason they're doing it is because they want me to stop,\" she said.\nLarry Cook, the founder of Stop Mandatory Vaccination, doesn't deny that such attacks on mothers of dead children exist.\nIn an email to CNN, he wrote that members of his group make more than half a million comments on the group's Facebook page each month.\n\"Any discussions about parents who lose their children after those children are vaccinated would be minor in number, and even smaller would be the number of members reaching out to parents in private message to share their concerns that vaccines may have played a role in a death,\" Cook wrote.\n\"I do not condone violent behavior or tone and encourage decorum during discussion,\" Cook wrote, adding that anyone \"who deliberately engage[s] in the politics of advocating for compulsory vaccination where children may be further damaged through government vaccine mandates can expect push back and resistance, alongside knowledgable discussions about vaccine risk in social media commentary.\"\nCook said some of the more than 160,000 members of his group have been targets of \"harassment campaigns,\" and that \"police have actually showed up at my members' doorsteps.\"\nHe added that he's been threatened and included a screenshot of a private Facebook message that said, \"Finally found where you live. Finally I'll be able to put a bullet in you. You are dead.\"\nAnother anti-vaccination leader blamed the postings on grieving parents' pages on \"infiltrators\" who try to \"create incendiary situations.\"\n\"I tell everybody that you should look at the person you're talking to and those on the other side of this discussion and recognize that they care about children, too,\" said Del Bigtree, chief executive officer of the Informed Consent Action Network.\nDuring the public comment period at a meeting last month of the US Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, more than a dozen people spoke about their concerns about vaccines. Some said they or their loved ones had been injured by vaccines.\n\"My older son suffered documented illness and regression following vaccination,\" said Jackie Martin-Sebell. \"These vaccines are not safe for everyone.\"\nAnother speaker, Rilei Cherry, said her son developed autism as a result of vaccines. \"We owe it to our children to truly look at the long term effects of vaccines and be honest about what could happen to our children,\" she told the CDC committee.\nDespite the speakers' concerns, more than a dozen studies have shown that vaccines do not cause autism. The American Academy of Pediatrics says \"Vaccines are safe. Vaccines are effective. Vaccines save lives.\"\nOn May 6, 2016, Promoli put her toddlers Jude and his twin brother Thomas, down for an afternoon nap in their home. Jude had a low-grade fever, but he was laughing and singing when he went down for his nap.\nWhen his mother went to check on him two hours later, he was dead. Promoli said the next few weeks were \"a living hell.\"\n\"Having to go in and plan a funeral and find the ability somehow to even take steps to walk into a funeral home, to make plans and decide whether to bury or cremate your child -- it was just all so horrifying,\" she said.\nWhen an autopsy came back showing Jude had died of the flu, Promoli started her flu prevention campaign.\nSome anti-vaxers told her she'd murdered Jude and made up a story about the flu to cover up her crime. Others said vaccines had killed her son. Some called her the c-word.\nThe worst ones -- the ones that would sometimes make her cry -- were the posts that said she was advocating for flu shots so that other children would die from the shots and their parents would be miserable like she was.\n\"The first time it made me feel really sick because I couldn't fathom how anybody could even come up with such a terrible claim,\" Promoli said. \"It caught me off guard in its cruelty. What kind of a person does this?\"\nTwisted logic that relies on scientific lies doesn't bother Promoli so much anymore. She's continued with her flu shot campaign, persuading Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to publicize his flu shot.\nShe said no matter how many nasty messages she's received -- and she says she's received hundreds -- she'll continue her campaign.\n\"The work that we're doing might mean that somebody else doesn't have to go plan a funeral for their toddler, and that is everything,\" she said.\nSerese Marotta lost her 5-year-old son, Joseph, to the flu in 2009, and is now chief operating officer of Families Fighting Flu, a group that encourages flu awareness and prevention, including vaccination.\nIn 2017, she posted a video on the eighth anniversary of her son's death to reinforce the importance of getting the flu vaccine.\n\"May you rot in hell for all the damages you do!\" a Facebook user wrote on another one of her posts.\n\"She called me a lot of names I won't repeat and used the go-to conspiracy theories about government and big pharma, and I responded, 'I lost a child,' and questioned where she was coming from, and she continued to attack me,\" said Marotta, who lives in Syracuse, New York.\nCatherine and Greg Hughes, an Australian couple who lost their 1-month old son, Riley, to whooping cough, have also received online abuse. Too young to be vaccinated, Riley relied on herd immunity -- the vaccinations of others -- to protect him.\nBut herd immunity didn't protect him, since the area where the Hughes family lived in Perth has some of the lowest vaccination rates in Australia.\n\"Riley's death was a very inconvenient truth for anti-vaccine activists,\" Catherine said. \"The nasty messages started 24 hours after he died. They called us baby killers and said we would have the blood of other babies on our hands. We've been told to kill ourselves.\"\n\"What a [f**king] evil whore you really are,\" another user wrote to them in a private Facebook message.\n\"A lot of them come from the position that they have children that were vaccine-injured,\" Catherine said. \"But a fair chunk of them are just haters.\"\nDorit Reiss, a professor at UC Hastings School of Law, has received countless vile messages, and as with the mothers, many of the messages are gender-oriented. Over the years, she's become pretty blas\u00e9 about it.\n\"'Whore' is pretty normal,\" said Reiss, a pro-vaccine advocate who has written extensively about vaccines. \"I've also been called a [c**t].\"\nOne Facebook user made a meme with a photo of her father with \"Proud Supporter of the Vaccine Holocaust.\" Reiss says her father has nothing to do with vaccines.\nAnother meme shows a photo of Reiss holding her infant son and it says that Reiss is \"FORCE-injecting\" her baby with vaccines.\nOther Facebook users have said her children look sick in photos, and that vaccines are clearly to blame.\n\"The Boy [sic] appears lethargic,\" one user wrote, with \"dark circles under his eyes. These are common precipitants of vaccine induced immune damage and suppression, as well as vaccine induced transient ischemic adverse event.\"\nOf all the various messages from anti-vaxers, Reiss said the one that angered her the most was a voicemail left for her husband on his work phone.\n\"If I hear or see anything written by your wife after today, I will release your phone number, your work phone number, your work address, her work address, her work phone number,\" the caller said, correctly reciting their phone numbers and home address.\nThree pediatricians who are vocal vaccine advocates have also been frequent targets of anti-vaxers. All three now have security escorts when they speak publicly.\nDr. Paul Offit keeps a fat folder of nasty messages he's received so that \"if someone kills me, my wife can give it to the police.\" He does not laugh when he says this.\n\"Rot in hell you baby killer,\" one user wrote in an email to Offit, who is director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and professor of pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\nDr. Peter Hotez at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston is a vaccine researcher who wrote a book about his daughter called \"Vaccines did not Cause Rachel's Autism.\"\n\"You have no morals whatsoever and you know that you are a [f**king] liar. I hope you rot in hell,\" one anti-vaxer emailed Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor.\nUsers on the social media platform MeWe discussed an upcoming public meeting Hotez was expected to attend.\n\"Maybe if we cause him enough stress he'll have a heart attack before [Wednesday],\" one woman wrote, adding, \"#sorrynotsorry.\"\nDr. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and a California state senator, spearheaded a successful attempt to get rid of vaccine exemptions for personal or religious reasons for schoolchildren in his state. He's frequently been the target of race-driven abuse by anti-vaxers on Facebook.\n\"Chinese garbage,\" one user wrote on Pan's Facebook page, followed by vomiting and devil emojis. \"Most ignorant [a**hole].\"\n\"I hope they stone you to death,\" another Facebook user wrote. \"I'll make a special trip to happily watch your head crack. The parents of the children you are destroying should each get a chance. Like a nazi pi\u00f1ata.\"\nSome of the professionals and the mothers interviewed for this story said they reported the abusive messages they received to Facebook. Most of those who made reports said they received an automated response and in the end nothing changed. Others said after they made a report the sender was suspended from Facebook for a short period of time, or their offensive messages were removed.\nOthers said they didn't report to Facebook because the process was onerous or they'd heard that it wouldn't change anything.\n\"We try to empower our users with controls, such as blocking other users and moderating comments, so they can limit their exposure to unwanted, offensive or hurtful content. We also encourage people to report bullying behavior on our platform, so we can review the content and take proper action,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email.\n\"We want members of our community to feel safe and respected on Facebook and will remove material that appears to purposefully target private individuals with the intention of degrading or shaming them.\"\nErin Costello creates fake Facebook accounts so she can join anti-vaxer groups to see if members are planning to attack mothers of dead children.\nErin Costello, a former bartender and current stay-at-home mom in Utica, New York, is the \"Ron\" who texted the grieving mother in the Midwest, warning her to expect more anti-vaxer attacks. Costello is an administrator for the pro-vaccine Facebook page \"What's the Harm?\"\nCostello is one of several vaccine advocates who've set up so-called \"sock puppet\" or fake Facebook accounts and then joins the closed anti-vaxer groups to spy on them.\nShe said she often sees members discussing posts by parents of sick or dead children, sometimes suggesting that members \"educate\" those parents by posting on their page.\nFor example, a member of the anti-vaccine group Stop Mandatory Vaccination said a mother had posted that her baby had suffered seizures after receiving vaccines.\nThe anti-vaxer urged others in the group to \"comment for her to read! I want to win this mom over and she really trusts her pediatrician but at the same time she is scared!\"\nAnother member of Stop Mandatory Vaccination re-posted a post by Catherine Hughes, the mother who'd lost her child to a vaccine-preventable disease, calling for others to vaccinate their children.\nAnother member responded, \"I feel sorry for the lost baby and her other children but someone needs to inject her with vaccines until she dies.\"\nWhen she sees anti-vaxers talking about parents in their closed groups, Costello, the online pro-vaccine spy, gets in touch with those parents to warn them they may be getting nasty messages from the anti-vaxers.\nWhen Costello reached out to the mother in the Midwest, she explained why she was contacting her.\n\"I know you're likely getting many horrible messages on Facebook right now,\" Costello wrote to the mother. \"Children such as [yours] are the reason why I do my part to fight for overwhelming acceptance of vaccines as well as fight against the lies and misinformation that are recklessly spread around against vaccines.\"\n\"I appreciate the strong role you take in helping protect families like mine,\" she said.\nAfter hundreds of Facebook comments from anti-vaxers, the mother turned off comments on her page, and deleted many of the ones she received.\nSome are still in her head, though. She weeps as she remembers the one that was hardest to read.\n\"The ones that said this was a fake story. That he wasn't real. That my child didn't exist,\" she said. \"Because when your child dies, that's the biggest fear -- that he will be forgotten.\"",

And even though she's not getting the breathless headlines of the B-boys -- Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg -- she's adeptly setting the bar for every other candidate in this race. The question now isn't her skill, style or substance. It's whether she'll get fair coverage from a political media eager to glom on to the shiny new thing, and unable to give a steady, competent woman her due.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/elizabeth-warren-town-hall-mississippi/index.html\">Warren's performance </a>wasn't perfect. She answered a question about affordable higher education and the rich being able to buy their way into nearly everything by talking about the influence of money in Washington, instead of addressing the college admissions scam in greater depth. Sometimes she dodged questions, such as when host Jake Tapper asked her specifically about reparations for slavery in the form of cash payments and about the possibility of eliminating private health insurance companies.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Warren: I'm tired of a Washington that works for the rich\" data-demand-load=\"loaded\" data-eq-pts=\"mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781\" data-eq-state=\"mini xsmall\" data-lazy-img-observe=\"true\" data-src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318210631-02-cnn-warren-town-hall-screen-grab-medium-plus-169.jpg\" data-src-full16x9=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318210631-02-cnn-warren-town-hall-screen-grab-full-169.jpg\" data-src-large=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318210631-02-cnn-warren-town-hall-screen-grab-super-169.jpg\" data-src-medium=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318210631-02-cnn-warren-town-hall-screen-grab-exlarge-169.jpg\" data-src-mini=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318210631-02-cnn-warren-town-hall-screen-grab-small-169.jpg\" data-src-mini1x1=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318210631-02-cnn-warren-town-hall-screen-grab-small-11.jpg\" data-src-small=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318210631-02-cnn-warren-town-hall-screen-grab-large-169.jpg\" data-src-xsmall=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318210631-02-cnn-warren-town-hall-screen-grab-medium-plus-169.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318210631-02-cnn-warren-town-hall-screen-grab-medium-plus-169.jpg\"></img></figure>\n<p>But more often, she connected. There were multiple times when she seemed near tears: When she recounted seeing men, women, girls and boys in cages near our southern border, I found myself watching in jaw-clenched silence; the auditorium, too, went still and soundless.</p>\n<p>Later, she told the story of her dad nearly dying of a heart attack <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/03/19/childhood-financial-problems-mom-dress-story-elizabeth-warren-town-hall-sot-vpx.cnn\">and her mother</a>, who had never worked outside the home, donning her best dress to go get a minimum wage job at Sears that kept the family afloat. The slightest waver crept into her voice as Warren talked about her own family's past. But when she connected it to our political present (&quot;Today, in America, a full-time minimum wage job will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty; I am in this fight because I believe that is wrong&quot;), she got loud -- she got mad. It was real and it was righteous.</p>\n<p>Warren's strategy, in her campaign and in this town hall, is start big and move to the granular. In response to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/elizabeth-warren-town-hall-mississippi/index.html\">question after question</a>, she led with a broad, values-driven idea (&quot;Health care is a basic human right and we fight for basic human rights;&quot; &quot;we are a country that is built on our differences, that is our strength, not our weakness;&quot; &quot;I believe we need a constitutional amendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizen and to make sure every vote gets counted&quot;) before outlining a more specific policy plan. And much of what she outlined was crucial, substantive and careful.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/09/opinions/elizabeth-warren-plan-to-break-up-tech-giants-alaimo/index.html\"><img alt=\"Elizabeth Warren's call to disband tech giants is a step in the right direction\" data-demand-load=\"loaded\" data-eq-pts=\"mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781\" data-eq-state=\"mini xsmall\" data-lazy-img-observe=\"true\" data-src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221185759-elizabeth-warren-file-0218-medium-plus-169.jpg\" data-src-full16x9=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221185759-elizabeth-warren-file-0218-full-169.jpg\" data-src-large=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221185759-elizabeth-warren-file-0218-super-169.jpg\" data-src-medium=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221185759-elizabeth-warren-file-0218-exlarge-169.jpg\" data-src-mini=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221185759-elizabeth-warren-file-0218-small-169.jpg\" data-src-mini1x1=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221185759-elizabeth-warren-file-0218-small-11.jpg\" data-src-small=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221185759-elizabeth-warren-file-0218-large-169.jpg\" data-src-xsmall=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221185759-elizabeth-warren-file-0218-medium-plus-169.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190221185759-elizabeth-warren-file-0218-medium-plus-169.jpg\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>She talked a lot about research, wanting to get experts and stakeholders in the room to come up with the best plan possible -- that was on the table for everything from maternal mortality to reparations for slavery. She talked a lot about the impact of race on inequality, and the impact of a self-interested class of highly influential millionaires and billionaires on fueling inequality. You can see why she made a great professor: It took her just a few sentences to explain her proposal to break up the big tech companies in digestible terms, and to get the audience quickly on her side. Most viewers, I imagine, walked away from this town hall having actually learned something.</p>\n<p>Warren's strength this cycle has come from two places: First, her ability to think big while actually planning out the details of how to achieve the sprawling policies she proposes; and second, her aptitude at talking about inequality as a class issue and a race issue and a gender issue.</p>\n<p>On Monday, she told us a little more about who she is, including about her faith. To be honest, I cringed a bit when Tapper asked about the role of faith in Warren's public and private life. Too often statements of faith (or lack thereof) can become a weapon for the religious right to attack progressives such as Warren; plus, the broad evangelical support enjoyed by a thrice-married philandering habitual liar has pretty much neutered any argument that this segment of the American faithful genuinely cares about morality. Nevertheless, Warren brought it, telling a Bible story with the fluency and vigor of someone behind a Sunday morning pulpit.</p>\n<p>Her challenge now is getting her due. Media narratives get set early (especially, it seems, for women), and hers so far is &quot;boring wonk.&quot; Putting aside that after several years of &quot;dramatic cretin,&quot; boring wonks should perhaps be met with a little more enthusiasm, Warren's time on the national stage Monday night showed depth, charisma and authenticity, all of the things voters say they want and the political press claims to value. Those of us with the privilege of platforms, and anyone who opines even in the most intimate quarters about the presidential race, owes Warren -- not the narratives or caricatures or assumptions about electability, but the woman herself -- a watch and a listen.</p>",

                "text": "(CNN)Big ideas? Check. Complex solutions broken down into digestible sound bites? Check. Heart-tugging anecdotes? Check. Authenticity? In spades.\nElizabeth Warren nailed her CNN town hall Monday night. And even though she's not getting the breathless headlines of the B-boys -- Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg -- she's adeptly setting the bar for every other candidate in this race. The question now isn't her skill, style or substance. It's whether she'll get fair coverage from a political media eager to glom on to the shiny new thing, and unable to give a steady, competent woman her due.\nWarren's performance wasn't perfect. She answered a question about affordable higher education and the rich being able to buy their way into nearly everything by talking about the influence of money in Washington, instead of addressing the college admissions scam in greater depth. Sometimes she dodged questions, such as when host Jake Tapper asked her specifically about reparations for slavery in the form of cash payments and about the possibility of eliminating private health insurance companies.\nBut more often, she connected. There were multiple times when she seemed near tears: When she recounted seeing men, women, girls and boys in cages near our southern border, I found myself watching in jaw-clenched silence; the auditorium, too, went still and soundless.\nLater, she told the story of her dad nearly dying of a heart attack and her mother, who had never worked outside the home, donning her best dress to go get a minimum wage job at Sears that kept the family afloat. The slightest waver crept into her voice as Warren talked about her own family's past. But when she connected it to our political present (\"Today, in America, a full-time minimum wage job will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty; I am in this fight because I believe that is wrong\"), she got loud -- she got mad. It was real and it was righteous.\nWarren's strategy, in her campaign and in this town hall, is start big and move to the granular. In response to question after question, she led with a broad, values-driven idea (\"Health care is a basic human right and we fight for basic human rights;\" \"we are a country that is built on our differences, that is our strength, not our weakness;\" \"I believe we need a constitutional amendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizen and to make sure every vote gets counted\") before outlining a more specific policy plan. And much of what she outlined was crucial, substantive and careful.\nShe talked a lot about research, wanting to get experts and stakeholders in the room to come up with the best plan possible -- that was on the table for everything from maternal mortality to reparations for slavery. She talked a lot about the impact of race on inequality, and the impact of a self-interested class of highly influential millionaires and billionaires on fueling inequality. You can see why she made a great professor: It took her just a few sentences to explain her proposal to break up the big tech companies in digestible terms, and to get the audience quickly on her side. Most viewers, I imagine, walked away from this town hall having actually learned something.\nWarren's strength this cycle has come from two places: First, her ability to think big while actually planning out the details of how to achieve the sprawling policies she proposes; and second, her aptitude at talking about inequality as a class issue and a race issue and a gender issue.\nOn Monday, she told us a little more about who she is, including about her faith. To be honest, I cringed a bit when Tapper asked about the role of faith in Warren's public and private life. Too often statements of faith (or lack thereof) can become a weapon for the religious right to attack progressives such as Warren; plus, the broad evangelical support enjoyed by a thrice-married philandering habitual liar has pretty much neutered any argument that this segment of the American faithful genuinely cares about morality. Nevertheless, Warren brought it, telling a Bible story with the fluency and vigor of someone behind a Sunday morning pulpit.\nHer challenge now is getting her due. Media narratives get set early (especially, it seems, for women), and hers so far is \"boring wonk.\" Putting aside that after several years of \"dramatic cretin,\" boring wonks should perhaps be met with a little more enthusiasm, Warren's time on the national stage Monday night showed depth, charisma and authenticity, all of the things voters say they want and the political press claims to value. Those of us with the privilege of platforms, and anyone who opines even in the most intimate quarters about the presidential race, owes Warren -- not the narratives or caricatures or assumptions about electability, but the woman herself -- a watch and a listen.",

Kamala Harris\" src=\"https://www.i.cdn.cnn.com/.a/2.186.1/assets/video_pinned_white_bg.jpg\"></img></figure>\n<p>(CNN)An 8-point jump in support for California Sen. Kamala Harris stands out in a new CNN Poll conducted by <a href=\"http://www.ssrs.com\">SSRS</a> that shows a field of four in double digits in the race for the Democratic nomination for president.</p>\n<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden (28%) and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (20%) continue to hold the top slots in the large Democratic field. Harris now stands at 12% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, up from 4% in December, and the latest entrant to the field -- former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke -- stands at 11%.</p>\n<p>Harris's rise comes across the board -- there is no major demographic group in which she lost support since December -- but her gains are more pronounced among Democrats (+10 points) than independents (+5), liberals (+10) more than moderates or conservatives (+7), women (+9) more than men (+6), and racial and ethnic minorities (+10) more than whites (+6).</p>\n<p>Beyond the top four, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (6%), former Secretary of State John Kerry (4%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (3%) and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (3%) round out the group earning more than 1% support in the poll. Another five candidates land at 1%, a minimum level candidates must meet in three separate polls in order to be included in the first debates of the cycle later this year.</p>\n<p>The poll also finds enthusiasm about voting next year already outpaces the level seen for any presidential contest since the turn of this century. Four in 10 say they are &quot;extremely enthusiastic&quot; about voting for president, far outpacing early reads in other recent presidential contests. CNN first began asking this question in the 2004 election cycle, and the previous high point among registered voters was 37% just days before the 2008 election.</p>\n<p>But unlike last year's midterm elections, when Democratic enthusiasm propelled the party to a majority in the House of Representatives, the energy now is higher among Republicans. Nearly 6 in 10 self-identified Republicans (57%) say they are extremely enthusiastic about voting for president, compared with 46% among Democrats and 26% among independents.</p>\n<p>That could be because it's a little easier for a voter to get excited if they have a good sense of who their party's standard bearer will be. And Republicans are largely in sync on the president.</p>\n<p>Three-quarters (76%) of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the party ought to nominate Trump in 2020, a figure that has held roughly steady for the last year. Nearly 8 in 10 say the party has a better chance of winning with Trump at the helm (78%) than with someone else at the top of the ticket (17%). That's a dramatic reversal from primary season in 2015, when a majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents thought the party would have a better chance with another candidate leading the ticket.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/18/politics/elizabeth-warren-townhall-takeaways/index.html\"><img alt=\"Five takeaways from Elizabeth Warren's CNN town hall\" data-demand-load=\"loaded\" data-eq-pts=\"mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781\" data-eq-state=\"mini xsmall\" data-lazy-img-observe=\"true\" data-src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318224044-14-cnn-warren-town-hall-medium-plus-169.jpg\" data-src-full16x9=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318224044-14-cnn-warren-town-hall-full-169.jpg\" data-src-large=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318224044-14-cnn-warren-town-hall-super-169.jpg\" data-src-medium=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318224044-14-cnn-warren-town-hall-exlarge-169.jpg\" data-src-mini=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318224044-14-cnn-warren-town-hall-small-169.jpg\" data-src-mini1x1=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318224044-14-cnn-warren-town-hall-small-11.jpg\" data-src-small=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318224044-14-cnn-warren-town-hall-large-169.jpg\" data-src-xsmall=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318224044-14-cnn-warren-town-hall-medium-plus-169.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318224044-14-cnn-warren-town-hall-medium-plus-169.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/18/politics/elizabeth-warren-townhall-takeaways/index.html\">Five takeaways from Elizabeth Warren's CNN town hall</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Almost 6 in 10 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, though, see their field as wide open at this point. Just 37% say that there are one or two candidates they would prefer to see win the Democratic nomination. Among those who do have favorites, the top four deepen their advantage: 33% in that group back Biden, 22% go toward Sanders, 13% each choose Harris and O'Rourke, with everyone else testing below 5%.</p>\n<p>A majority of Democratic leaners say they would rather see the party nominate a candidate with a strong chance of beating Trump (56%), while 35% say they prioritize a candidate's issue positions over electability.</p>\n<p>That preference for electability appears to work against Sanders most strongly. Among those who prefer someone who can beat Trump, Biden leads at 32%, followed by Harris at 16%, Sanders at 14% and O'Rourke at 11%. Those looking for ideological purity are more apt to favor Sanders (31% back him, vs. 21% Biden, 11% O'Rourke and 7% Harris).</p>\n<p>Asked directly whether Democrats have a better chance with Sanders at the top of the ticket or someone else facing off against Trump, 56% of Democratic leaners say the party's chances are better without Sanders. Asked the same about Biden, 51% say the party has a better shot with Biden than without him.</p>\n<p>Those numbers suggest at least some of the support for Biden and for Sanders is based on something more than just the fact that they are the best-known candidates in the field. But it also does raise the question of whether either will be able to expand on their support as the campaign moves forward and voters get to know their fellow contenders.</p>\n<p>Biden's support, for example, hits 30% among moderate and conservative Democrats. But compared with December, Biden has held about steady while O'Rourke, whose favorability rating with this group grew from 27% to 40% over the same time period, gained 5 points in the horserace.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/21/politics/2020-democrats-running-for-president/index.html\"><img alt=\"Here are the Democrats who have said they're running for president\" data-demand-load=\"loaded\" data-eq-pts=\"mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781\" data-eq-state=\"mini xsmall\" data-lazy-img-observe=\"true\" data-src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190107093415-kamala-harris-us-capitol-medium-plus-169.jpg\" data-src-full16x9=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190107093415-kamala-harris-us-capitol-full-169.jpg\" data-src-large=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190107093415-kamala-harris-us-capitol-super-169.jpg\" data-src-medium=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190107093415-kamala-harris-us-capitol-exlarge-169.jpg\" data-src-mini=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190107093415-kamala-harris-us-capitol-small-169.jpg\" data-src-mini1x1=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190107093415-kamala-harris-us-capitol-small-11.jpg\" data-src-small=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190107093415-kamala-harris-us-capitol-large-169.jpg\" data-src-xsmall=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190107093415-kamala-harris-us-capitol-medium-plus-169.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190107093415-kamala-harris-us-capitol-medium-plus-169.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/21/politics/2020-democrats-running-for-president/index.html\">Here are the Democrats who have said they're running for president</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>It is still possible for these well-known players to get an announcement bump and, as the highest-scoring unannounced candidate in the field, Biden may yet benefit from making it official.</p>\n<p>Sanders announced his run on February 19, and his overall standing rose from 14% in December to 20% now. His favorability rating remains unchanged among Democrats (around three-quarters viewed him favorably in December and about the same share say so now), but has taken a hit outside the party (from 51% favorable and 35% unfavorable in December among all adults to 46% favorable, 43% unfavorable now).</p>\n<p>The poll also finds Democrats and Republicans have completely different issue priorities when thinking about next year's election. Among Republicans, immigration and the economy are the top two issues by far, followed by considerations about a candidate's ideology or positions on the issues generally. On the Democratic side, they're weighing a candidate's personal attributes, immigration, the economy and health care all about evenly.</p>\n<p>The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS March 14 through 17 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. For the subsample of 456 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, it is 5.7 points, and it is 5.5 points for the subset of 448 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.</p>",

                "text": "(CNN)An 8-point jump in support for California Sen. Kamala Harris stands out in a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS that shows a field of four in double digits in the race for the Democratic nomination for president.\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden (28%) and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (20%) continue to hold the top slots in the large Democratic field. Harris now stands at 12% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, up from 4% in December, and the latest entrant to the field -- former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke -- stands at 11%.\nHarris's rise comes across the board -- there is no major demographic group in which she lost support since December -- but her gains are more pronounced among Democrats (+10 points) than independents (+5), liberals (+10) more than moderates or conservatives (+7), women (+9) more than men (+6), and racial and ethnic minorities (+10) more than whites (+6).\nBeyond the top four, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (6%), former Secretary of State John Kerry (4%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (3%) and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (3%) round out the group earning more than 1% support in the poll. Another five candidates land at 1%, a minimum level candidates must meet in three separate polls in order to be included in the first debates of the cycle later this year.\nThe poll also finds enthusiasm about voting next year already outpaces the level seen for any presidential contest since the turn of this century. Four in 10 say they are \"extremely enthusiastic\" about voting for president, far outpacing early reads in other recent presidential contests. CNN first began asking this question in the 2004 election cycle, and the previous high point among registered voters was 37% just days before the 2008 election.\nBut unlike last year's midterm elections, when Democratic enthusiasm propelled the party to a majority in the House of Representatives, the energy now is higher among Republicans. Nearly 6 in 10 self-identified Republicans (57%) say they are extremely enthusiastic about voting for president, compared with 46% among Democrats and 26% among independents.\nThat could be because it's a little easier for a voter to get excited if they have a good sense of who their party's standard bearer will be. And Republicans are largely in sync on the president.\nThree-quarters (76%) of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the party ought to nominate Trump in 2020, a figure that has held roughly steady for the last year. Nearly 8 in 10 say the party has a better chance of winning with Trump at the helm (78%) than with someone else at the top of the ticket (17%). That's a dramatic reversal from primary season in 2015, when a majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents thought the party would have a better chance with another candidate leading the ticket.\nAlmost 6 in 10 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, though, see their field as wide open at this point. Just 37% say that there are one or two candidates they would prefer to see win the Democratic nomination. Among those who do have favorites, the top four deepen their advantage: 33% in that group back Biden, 22% go toward Sanders, 13% each choose Harris and O'Rourke, with everyone else testing below 5%.\nA majority of Democratic leaners say they would rather see the party nominate a candidate with a strong chance of beating Trump (56%), while 35% say they prioritize a candidate's issue positions over electability.\nThat preference for electability appears to work against Sanders most strongly. Among those who prefer someone who can beat Trump, Biden leads at 32%, followed by Harris at 16%, Sanders at 14% and O'Rourke at 11%. Those looking for ideological purity are more apt to favor Sanders (31% back him, vs. 21% Biden, 11% O'Rourke and 7% Harris).\nAsked directly whether Democrats have a better chance with Sanders at the top of the ticket or someone else facing off against Trump, 56% of Democratic leaners say the party's chances are better without Sanders. Asked the same about Biden, 51% say the party has a better shot with Biden than without him.\nThose numbers suggest at least some of the support for Biden and for Sanders is based on something more than just the fact that they are the best-known candidates in the field. But it also does raise the question of whether either will be able to expand on their support as the campaign moves forward and voters get to know their fellow contenders.\nBiden's support, for example, hits 30% among moderate and conservative Democrats. But compared with December, Biden has held about steady while O'Rourke, whose favorability rating with this group grew from 27% to 40% over the same time period, gained 5 points in the horserace.\nIt is still possible for these well-known players to get an announcement bump and, as the highest-scoring unannounced candidate in the field, Biden may yet benefit from making it official.\nSanders announced his run on February 19, and his overall standing rose from 14% in December to 20% now. His favorability rating remains unchanged among Democrats (around three-quarters viewed him favorably in December and about the same share say so now), but has taken a hit outside the party (from 51% favorable and 35% unfavorable in December among all adults to 46% favorable, 43% unfavorable now).\nThe poll also finds Democrats and Republicans have completely different issue priorities when thinking about next year's election. Among Republicans, immigration and the economy are the top two issues by far, followed by considerations about a candidate's ideology or positions on the issues generally. On the Democratic side, they're weighing a candidate's personal attributes, immigration, the economy and health care all about evenly.\nThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS March 14 through 17 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. For the subsample of 456 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, it is 5.7 points, and it is 5.5 points for the subset of 448 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.",

Earlier this month, Nadler sent 81 letters to individuals and entities as the first step in his probe, including the President's sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, former aides like McGahn and business associates like Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. How those individuals responded to Nadler's Monday deadline is unclear.</p>\n<p>In a statement Monday, Nadler said he was &quot;encouraged&quot; by many of the initial responses, though he indicated that the committee would have to issue subpoenas, including to some who said they would only comply if they were forced to do so. The committee said it had received &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of documents already, and Nadler told MSNBC that former Trump adviser Steve Bannon sent the committee &quot;a few thousand documents.&quot;</p>\n<p>GOP aides said the pages of documents provided so far were just over 8,000. Those included 2,688 pages from Bannon, 3,349 pages from Trump donor and friend Tom Barrack, 1,466 pages from the NRA and 104 pages from Trump's inaugural committee. The pages provided to the committee were <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/19/nadler-probe-trump-1227671\">first reported by Politico.</a></p>\n<p>Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, former campaign aide JD Gordon, former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg and Trump Tower meeting participant Rinat Akhmetshin also provided documents.</p>\n<p>&quot;Democrats have only provided about 8,000 pages of documents received in response to their 81 letters, which doesn't approach the claim they've received tens of thousands of documents,&quot; said Jessica Andrews, a spokeswoman for the committee's top Republican, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia. &quot;Either Democrats are deliberately concealing committee records &mdash; which confirms they're invested in partisan inquisitions more than credible oversight &mdash; or they are deliberately misrepresenting the facts to the press and American public.&quot;</p>\n<p>A Democratic aide argued that the Republican list of individuals who responded was incomplete, because the committee has negotiated additional agreements to receive documents even if they have not provided them yet.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/politics/house-judiciary-committee-list-letters/index.html\"><img alt=\"See the more than 80 names receiving House Judiciary Committee letters in its investigation\" data-demand-load=\"loaded\" data-eq-pts=\"mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781\" data-eq-state=\"mini xsmall\" data-lazy-img-observe=\"true\" data-src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150821113641-rep-jerry-nadler-medium-plus-169.jpg\" data-src-full16x9=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150821113641-rep-jerry-nadler-full-169.jpg\" data-src-large=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150821113641-rep-jerry-nadler-super-169.jpg\" data-src-medium=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150821113641-rep-jerry-nadler-exlarge-169.jpg\" data-src-mini=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150821113641-rep-jerry-nadler-small-169.jpg\" data-src-mini1x1=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150821113641-rep-jerry-nadler-small-11.jpg\" data-src-small=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150821113641-rep-jerry-nadler-large-169.jpg\" data-src-xsmall=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150821113641-rep-jerry-nadler-medium-plus-169.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150821113641-rep-jerry-nadler-medium-plus-169.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/politics/house-judiciary-committee-list-letters/index.html\">See the more than 80 names receiving House Judiciary Committee letters in its investigation</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In a statement Monday, Nadler said: &quot;At this point, the committee has heard from a large number of the recipients, many of whom have either sent or agreed to send documents to the Committee.&quot;</p>\n<p>Others in Trump's orbit did not give the committee any documents ahead by Monday's deadline.</p>\n<p>An attorney for former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo, Dennis Vacco, told the committee that Caputo &quot;is not in possession of any documentation responsive to your request.&quot;</p>\n<p>And an attorney for Randy Credico, a New York radio personality and one-time associate of Roger Stone, wrote in a letter to the committee that all relevant documents had been turned over to special counsel Robert Mueller after Credico was subpoenaed.</p>\n<p>&quot;Mr. Credico has no objection to the Special Counsel's Office providing to your committee all of the materials which were turned over to them pursuant to subpoena,&quot; wrote Credico's lawyer, Martin Stolar.</p>\n<p>Caputo's lawyer also pushed back on what's likely to be the next phase of the Judiciary Committee's investigation: witness interviews.</p>\n<p>Vacco argued that Caputo has already testified before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, and was interviewed by the special counsel's office, and there was no reason for him to speak before an additional committee.</p>\n<p>&quot;Respectfully, there are only so many ways the same questions can be asked of Mr. Caputo,&quot; Vacco wrote. &quot;We see no reason why the House Judiciary Committee cannot obtain the transcript of Mr. Caputo's testimony from (the House Intelligence Committee), and we encourage you to do so.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>CNN's Sara Murray and Kara Scannell contributed to this report.</em></p>",

                "text": "(CNN)The White House missed a House Judiciary Committee deadline to turn over scores of records as part of a sweeping Democratic-led investigation into whether President Donald Trump abused his power in office, according to a source familiar with the situation.\nAnd some former White House officials who received letters from the committee requesting documents, including former White House counsel Don McGahn and former deputy counsel Annie Donaldson, are referring the inquiries to the White House.\nIn all, Republican aides said the committee had received responses from eight of the 81 officials who received letters from the committee earlier this month, and a ninth had mailed documents, though they had yet to be received. But Democrats said more recipients had agreed to provide documents to the panel.\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler had set a Monday deadline asking for an array of documents -- including over the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, internal discussions about the decision of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia probe, details about any talks to dismiss special counsel Robert Mueller as well as records about payments Trump made as part of a hush-money scheme to keep his alleged extramarital affairs from going public.\nThe source told CNN that the White House has not yet responded, though it intends to in the near future.\nThe Trump administration has missed a number of deadlines set by various House committees vowing to intensify their oversight of the President, setting the stage for a months-long battle with Democrats poised to issue subpoenas in their demands for information.\nNadler's investigation is stretching into various aspects of Trump's political and business careers, focusing on what Democrats believe are corrupt business practices and potential illegal activities at the White House. Earlier this month, Nadler sent 81 letters to individuals and entities as the first step in his probe, including the President's sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, former aides like McGahn and business associates like Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. How those individuals responded to Nadler's Monday deadline is unclear.\nIn a statement Monday, Nadler said he was \"encouraged\" by many of the initial responses, though he indicated that the committee would have to issue subpoenas, including to some who said they would only comply if they were forced to do so. The committee said it had received \"tens of thousands\" of documents already, and Nadler told MSNBC that former Trump adviser Steve Bannon sent the committee \"a few thousand documents.\"\nGOP aides said the pages of documents provided so far were just over 8,000. Those included 2,688 pages from Bannon, 3,349 pages from Trump donor and friend Tom Barrack, 1,466 pages from the NRA and 104 pages from Trump's inaugural committee. The pages provided to the committee were first reported by Politico.\nFormer Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, former campaign aide JD Gordon, former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg and Trump Tower meeting participant Rinat Akhmetshin also provided documents.\n\"Democrats have only provided about 8,000 pages of documents received in response to their 81 letters, which doesn't approach the claim they've received tens of thousands of documents,\" said Jessica Andrews, a spokeswoman for the committee's top Republican, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia. \"Either Democrats are deliberately concealing committee records \u2014 which confirms they're invested in partisan inquisitions more than credible oversight \u2014 or they are deliberately misrepresenting the facts to the press and American public.\"\nA Democratic aide argued that the Republican list of individuals who responded was incomplete, because the committee has negotiated additional agreements to receive documents even if they have not provided them yet.\nIn a statement Monday, Nadler said: \"At this point, the committee has heard from a large number of the recipients, many of whom have either sent or agreed to send documents to the Committee.\"\nOthers in Trump's orbit did not give the committee any documents ahead by Monday's deadline.\nAn attorney for former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo, Dennis Vacco, told the committee that Caputo \"is not in possession of any documentation responsive to your request.\"\nAnd an attorney for Randy Credico, a New York radio personality and one-time associate of Roger Stone, wrote in a letter to the committee that all relevant documents had been turned over to special counsel Robert Mueller after Credico was subpoenaed.\n\"Mr. Credico has no objection to the Special Counsel's Office providing to your committee all of the materials which were turned over to them pursuant to subpoena,\" wrote Credico's lawyer, Martin Stolar.\nCaputo's lawyer also pushed back on what's likely to be the next phase of the Judiciary Committee's investigation: witness interviews.\nVacco argued that Caputo has already testified before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, and was interviewed by the special counsel's office, and there was no reason for him to speak before an additional committee.\n\"Respectfully, there are only so many ways the same questions can be asked of Mr. Caputo,\" Vacco wrote. \"We see no reason why the House Judiciary Committee cannot obtain the transcript of Mr. Caputo's testimony from (the House Intelligence Committee), and we encourage you to do so.\"\nCNN's Sara Murray and Kara Scannell contributed to this report.",

Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>She's been hounded by her botched handling of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/29/politics/elizabeth-warren-native-american-pocahontas/index.html\">claims of Native American heritage</a> and has watched as fellow senators like Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris have zoomed past her in the early jockeying for the chance to take on President Donald Trump next November.</p>\n<p>Which makes what happened Monday night in Jackson, Mississippi, very important for Warren and her supporters. At a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/18/politics/elizabeth-warren-townhall-takeaways/index.html\">CNN-sponsored town hall</a>, Warren delivered a very strong performance in which her policy chops, which we knew about, were bolstered by the powerful -- and emotional -- re-telling of her childhood struggles.</p>\n<p>One moment in particular stood out. Here's the exchange between Warren and CNN's Jake Tapper:</p>\n<p><em>TAPPER: You talk about how your family stood at the brink of financial disaster through a good part of your childhood. How has that shaped your life in the Senate?</em></p>\n<p><em>WARREN: I'll tell you about that. I have three older brothers. They all went off and joined the military. That was their ticket to America's middle class. I was </em><em>the late-in-life baby. My mother used to call me the &quot;surprise&quot; and about the time I was in middle school, my daddy had a heart attack and it was serious. Thought he was going to die. The church neighbors brought covered dishes. It was a scary time. He survived but he couldn't go back to work. We lost our family station wagon and at night I would hear my parents talk and that's where I learned words like mortgage and foreclosure and I remember the day that I walked into my parents' bedroom and laying out on the bed is the dress. And some people here will know the dress. It's the one that only comes out for weddings, funerals and graduations and my mother is in her slip and she is stocking feet and she's pacing back and forth and she's crying. She is saying &quot;we will not lose this house. We will not lose this house.&quot; She was 50 years old. She had never worked outside the home. She was truly terrified. And I watched her while she finally just pulled it together, put that dress on, put on her high heels and blew her nose and walked to the Sears and got a minimum wage job, and that minimum wage job saved our house, but more importantly, it saved our family.</em></p>\n<p>To get the full effect of the answer, you need to watch it. Warren is visibly emotional, her eyes welling up with tears as she recounts the courage of her mother. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/politics/2019/03/19/childhood-financial-problems-mom-dress-story-elizabeth-warren-town-hall-sot-vpx.cnn.html\">Watch this</a>:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Elizabeth Warren shares emotional story about her mom\" data-demand-load=\"loaded\" data-eq-pts=\"mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781\" data-eq-state=\"mini xsmall\" data-lazy-img-observe=\"true\" data-src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318212710-06-elizabeth-warren-town-hall-medium-plus-169.jpg\" data-src-full16x9=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318212710-06-elizabeth-warren-town-hall-full-169.jpg\" data-src-large=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318212710-06-elizabeth-warren-town-hall-super-169.jpg\" data-src-medium=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318212710-06-elizabeth-warren-town-hall-exlarge-169.jpg\" data-src-mini=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318212710-06-elizabeth-warren-town-hall-small-169.jpg\" data-src-mini1x1=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318212710-06-elizabeth-warren-town-hall-small-11.jpg\" data-src-small=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318212710-06-elizabeth-warren-town-hall-large-169.jpg\" data-src-xsmall=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318212710-06-elizabeth-warren-town-hall-medium-plus-169.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318212710-06-elizabeth-warren-town-hall-medium-plus-169.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Elizabeth Warren shares emotional story about her mom</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Why did this moment matter? Because presidential campaigns are about moments, about glimpses into who a candidate really is and what motivates them to run for the highest office in the country.</p>\n<p>For most voters, Warren was just a jumble of policy proposals before Monday night. She is a self-admitted policy wonk who has put her meaty policy prescriptions front and center in the campaign. But voters don't choose a candidate based solely on policy papers. If they did, every president would be a former think-tanker. Who the candidate is, really, plays an absolutely critical role in the presidential decision. At root, people usually vote for president based on a belief that the person they are choosing &quot;gets&quot; them in some fundamental way.</p>\n<p>Which brings me back to Warren's emotional recounting of her family's economic struggles and her mother's bravery in the face of possible financial ruin. It wasn't the first time she's told that story. As<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mj_lee\"> MJ Lee</a>, who covers Warren for CNN, noted, that retelling of her childhood is a staple of Warren's stump speech. But most people haven't seen a Warren stump speech. They have likely read or seen coverage of her struggles to clear up whether she is of Native American descent (or not). Maybe they know she is a senator from Massachusetts who previously worked in the Obama administration. But that's about it.</p>\n<p>Warren's powerful delivery of her childhood struggles Monday was on national TV and in primetime. Lots and lots of people either saw it live, watched a snippet of it on social media or read about it on a website just like this one. That matters. To win a presidential nomination, you have to be able to perform when the bright lights come on and everyone is watching.</p>\n<p>Warren did that on Monday night. Which should serve as a shot of momentum for a campaign that needs it.</p>",

                "text": "(CNN)It's been a bit of a rough start for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential campaign.\nShe's been hounded by her botched handling of claims of Native American heritage and has watched as fellow senators like Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris have zoomed past her in the early jockeying for the chance to take on President Donald Trump next November.\nWhich makes what happened Monday night in Jackson, Mississippi, very important for Warren and her supporters. At a CNN-sponsored town hall, Warren delivered a very strong performance in which her policy chops, which we knew about, were bolstered by the powerful -- and emotional -- re-telling of her childhood struggles.\nOne moment in particular stood out. Here's the exchange between Warren and CNN's Jake Tapper:\nTAPPER: You talk about how your family stood at the brink of financial disaster through a good part of your childhood. How has that shaped your life in the Senate?\nWARREN: I'll tell you about that. I have three older brothers. They all went off and joined the military. That was their ticket to America's middle class. I was the late-in-life baby. My mother used to call me the \"surprise\" and about the time I was in middle school, my daddy had a heart attack and it was serious. Thought he was going to die. The church neighbors brought covered dishes. It was a scary time. He survived but he couldn't go back to work. We lost our family station wagon and at night I would hear my parents talk and that's where I learned words like mortgage and foreclosure and I remember the day that I walked into my parents' bedroom and laying out on the bed is the dress. And some people here will know the dress. It's the one that only comes out for weddings, funerals and graduations and my mother is in her slip and she is stocking feet and she's pacing back and forth and she's crying. She is saying \"we will not lose this house. We will not lose this house.\" She was 50 years old. She had never worked outside the home. She was truly terrified. And I watched her while she finally just pulled it together, put that dress on, put on her high heels and blew her nose and walked to the Sears and got a minimum wage job, and that minimum wage job saved our house, but more importantly, it saved our family.\nTo get the full effect of the answer, you need to watch it. Warren is visibly emotional, her eyes welling up with tears as she recounts the courage of her mother. Watch this:\nWhy did this moment matter? Because presidential campaigns are about moments, about glimpses into who a candidate really is and what motivates them to run for the highest office in the country.\nFor most voters, Warren was just a jumble of policy proposals before Monday night. She is a self-admitted policy wonk who has put her meaty policy prescriptions front and center in the campaign. But voters don't choose a candidate based solely on policy papers. If they did, every president would be a former think-tanker. Who the candidate is, really, plays an absolutely critical role in the presidential decision. At root, people usually vote for president based on a belief that the person they are choosing \"gets\" them in some fundamental way.\nWhich brings me back to Warren's emotional recounting of her family's economic struggles and her mother's bravery in the face of possible financial ruin. It wasn't the first time she's told that story. As MJ Lee, who covers Warren for CNN, noted, that retelling of her childhood is a staple of Warren's stump speech. But most people haven't seen a Warren stump speech. They have likely read or seen coverage of her struggles to clear up whether she is of Native American descent (or not). Maybe they know she is a senator from Massachusetts who previously worked in the Obama administration. But that's about it.\nWarren's powerful delivery of her childhood struggles Monday was on national TV and in primetime. Lots and lots of people either saw it live, watched a snippet of it on social media or read about it on a website just like this one. That matters. To win a presidential nomination, you have to be able to perform when the bright lights come on and everyone is watching.\nWarren did that on Monday night. Which should serve as a shot of momentum for a campaign that needs it.",

However, her decades-long career spans multiple disciplines, including physics, geometry and quantum theory.\n\"Uhlenbeck's research has led to revolutionary advances at the intersection of mathematics and physics,\" Paul Goldbart, dean of the University of Texas' College of Natural Sciences said in a release. \"Her pioneering insights have applications across a range of fascinating subjects, from string theory, which may help explain the nature of reality, to the geometry of space-time.\"\nOne of Uhlenbeck's most famous contributions was her theories of predictive mathematics inspired by soap bubbles. The thin, curved surface area of a soap bubble is an example of a \"minimal surface,\" a surface that forms itself into a shape that takes up the least amount of area. Examining how these surfaces behave can help researchers better understand a wide amount of phenomena across a wide array of scientific studies.\n\"Her theories have revolutionized our understanding of minimal surfaces, such as those formed by soap bubbles, and more general minimization problems in higher dimensions,\" Hans Munthe-Kaas, chair of the Abel Committee said in a release.\nWant more inspiring, positive news?

The monthly installments were for $83,333 and totaled $583,332 from January, 2017 to August 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Why this matters</strong>: The government, in its documents, states that LLC is &quot;an investment management firm controlled by Renova Group, an industrial holding company based in Zurich, Switzerland that is controlled by Russian national Viktor Vekselberg.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Who's that?</strong> Viktor Vekselberg is an oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/25/politics/viktor-vekselberg-trump-tower-michael-cohen-meeting/index.html\">sanctioned</a> in early 2018 for activities including election interference.

Prosecutors in SDNY took this procedural step out of an abundance of caution, according to the court filings.</p>\n<p>The DVDs were not collected during the April raid and they do not belong to Cohen.</p>\n<p>One of the DVDs was labeled <strong>&quot;Cohen &mdash; 2018.03.07,&quot;</strong> according to the documents. The second DVD was labeled <strong>&quot;2-28-18 Cohen SW Returns &mdash; Google and 1&amp;1,&quot; </strong>according to the records.</p>\n<p><em>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post said that federal prosecutors retrieved two DVDs belonging to Cohen during the April 2018 raid.

He has not given the White House his two weeks&rsquo; notice.</p>\n<p><strong>Why this matters: </strong>Rosenstein has been overseeing the Russia investigation and as CNN has reported, he has signaled to other officials that he would leave when he was satisfied that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation was either complete or close enough to completion that it was protected.</p>\n<h2>Mueller twice received approval to track who Cohen called &mdash; and who called him</h2>\n<p>From CNN's Katelyn Polantz</p>\n<p>Chief Judge Beryl Howell of DC District Court &mdash; whom Special Counsel Robert Mueller asked for warrant approvals related to Michael Cohen &mdash; granted approval on two separate occasions to track the numbers of Cohen's incoming and outgoing phone calls.</p>\n<p>Those approvals came on:</p>\n<p>Mueller's team then handed over that data to the Manhattan federal prosecutors when they referred the case.</p>\n<h2>Mueller referred Cohen to SDNY in February 2018.

                "text": "The Cohen materials outline how in October 2016 Essential Consultants was established, and then how in January 2017, money began to flow in monthly from Columbus Nova LLC. The monthly installments were for $83,333 and totaled $583,332 from January, 2017 to August 2017.\nWhy this matters: The government, in its documents, states that LLC is \"an investment management firm controlled by Renova Group, an industrial holding company based in Zurich, Switzerland that is controlled by Russian national Viktor Vekselberg.\"\nWho's that? Viktor Vekselberg is an oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was sanctioned in early 2018 for activities including election interference. The sanctions prohibit Vekselberg from traveling to the US.\nHere's the text from the document:\nClarification: The headline of this post has been updated to reflect that Columbus Nova is linked to Viktor Vekselberg, rather than controlled by him, as described in court documents.\nFederal prosecutors got permission to review materials obtained by Robert Mueller\nFrom CNN's Marshall Cohen\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan got permission from a judge to review materials about Michael Cohen that were previously obtained by special counsel Robert Mueller, according to documents unsealed on Tuesday.\nSpecifically, the Manhattan prosecutors got permission to review two DVDs and a USB drive full of information that was apparently collected by Mueller\u2019s team, which included what appears to be the legal documents regarding the searches themselves. Prosecutors in SDNY took this procedural step out of an abundance of caution, according to the court filings.\nThe DVDs were not collected during the April raid and they do not belong to Cohen.\nOne of the DVDs was labeled \"Cohen \u2014 2018.03.07,\" according to the documents. The second DVD was labeled \"2-28-18 Cohen SW Returns \u2014 Google and 1&1,\" according to the records.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this post said that federal prosecutors retrieved two DVDs belonging to Cohen during the April 2018 raid. The DVDs were not actually collected during the April raid and they did not belong to Cohen.\nMueller's team was investigating Cohen for these alleged crimes\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller's office was investigating Michael Cohen for lying to banks, breaking foreign lobbying laws and money laundering, according to one of the newly released search warrants in Manhattan federal court.\nBut note: Cohen has notbeen charged with illegal foreign lobbying or with money laundering.\nMueller's search warrants \u2014 which were approved by a federal judge in DC in the second half of 2017 \u2014 sought Cohen's emails related to his business dealings under a shell company used to cut hush money deals with women accusing then-candidate Donald Trump of extramarital affairs.\nMueller's justification for those warrants were \"several different courses of conduct by Cohen, including, among other things, false statements to financial institutions relating to the purpose of an account he opened in the name of Essential Consultants LLC and the nature of funds flowing into that account, and activities undertaken by Cohen on behalf of certain foreign persons or foreign entities without having registered as a foreign agent,\" an FBI investigator wrote to a judge, piggybacking on Mueller's pursuit.\nCohen used money from shell account to pay private social club fees and American Express charges\nFrom CNN's Erica Orden\nMichael Cohen withdrew money from his shell company Essential Consultants account for \u201clargely personal purposes\u201d \u2014 including fees from \u201cthe Core Club,\u201d which is a private social club on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, according to page 26 of exhibit one.\nHere's the text:\nThere are details about alleged campaign finance violations in the warrants \u2014 but they're redacted\nFrom CNN's Katelyn Polantz\nManhattan federal prosecutors have kept pages of details secret about their justification for seeking warrants on Michael Cohen related to his close ties to President Trump and then-alleged campaign finance violations for hush money payments to women around the 2016 election.\nThere does not appear to be extensive justification the prosecutors have made visible to the public that describes their reasoning for looking at phone and email communications of Cohen.\nInstead, in describing to a federal judge probable cause they had to investigate Cohen's campaign-time scheme, investigators write almost 20 pages of detail \u2014 but they're are all redacted.\nThe Manhattan US Attorney and FBI \"are investigating a criminal violation of the campaign finance laws by Michael Cohen, a lawyer who holds himself out as the personal attorney for President Donald J Trump. As detailed, there is probable cause to believe that REDACTED,\" they wrote to the judge.\nRod Rosenstein, who oversees the Russia investigation, is staying \"a little longer\" than anticipated\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is planning to stay on at the Justice Department \u201ca little longer\u201d than originally anticipated, according to a Justice official familiar with his thinking.\nInitially, he planned to leave in mid-March, but no firm date was ever set and after consulting with Attorney General Bill Barr he will now continue on a bit longer. He has not given the White House his two weeks\u2019 notice.\nWhy this matters: Rosenstein has been overseeing the Russia investigation and as CNN has reported, he has signaled to other officials that he would leave when he was satisfied that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation was either complete or close enough to completion that it was protected.\nMueller twice received approval to track who Cohen called \u2014 and who called him\nFrom CNN's Katelyn Polantz\nChief Judge Beryl Howell of DC District Court \u2014 whom Special Counsel Robert Mueller asked for warrant approvals related to Michael Cohen \u2014 granted approval on two separate occasions to track the numbers of Cohen's incoming and outgoing phone calls.\nThose approvals came on:\nMueller's team then handed over that data to the Manhattan federal prosecutors when they referred the case.\nMueller referred Cohen to SDNY in February 2018. The raid happened 2 months later.\nFrom CNN's Erica Orden\nPg. 7 of exhibit 2 establishes that Special Counsel Robert Mueller referred Michael Cohen to federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York on Feb. 8, 2018.\nThe Cohen raid took place nearly 2 months later to the day, on April 9.\nHere's part of the text:",
