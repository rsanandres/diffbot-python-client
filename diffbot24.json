(AP Photo/Michel Euler)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As explained in <a href=\"https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/14044/europe-churches-vandalized\">this recent article</a>, all around Western Europe, churches are under attack. Along with arson attempts, typically&mdash;and rather with diabolical intent&mdash;altars are desecrated, crucifixes broken, statues mocked and/or beheaded, and the churches set aflame.</p>\n<p>Sometimes fecal matter is smeared on the churches. Last February in France, for instance, vandals plundered and used <a href=\"https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/occitanie/gard/nimes/nimes-eglise-notre-dame-enfants-vandalisee-1620461.html\">human excrement to draw a cross</a> on the Notre-Dame des Enfants Church in Nimes; consecrated bread was found thrown outside among garbage. One week later, vandals <a href=\"https://www.ladepeche.fr/2019/02/09/profanation-de-la-cathedrale-de-lavaur-deux-lyceens-convoques-par-le-juge-des-enfants,8005054.php\">desecrated and smashed crosses</a> and statues at Saint-Alain Cathedral in Lavaur; they mangled the arms of a crucified Christ in a mocking manner and an altar cloth was burned.</p>\n<p>While European authorities and media usually obfuscate over the identity of the desecrators, demographics offer a clue: true to &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.raymondibrahim.com/2013/05/28/islams-rule-of-numbers-and-the-london-beheading/\">Islam&rsquo;s Rule of Numbers</a>,&rdquo; Western European nations that have large Muslim migrant populations tend to witness the most attacks.</p>\n<p>Thus in France, which has one of if not the largest Muslim populations in Western Europe, <a href=\"http://www.pi-news.net/2019/03/wams-jeden-tag-zwei-kirchenschaendungen-in-frankreich/\">two churches are attacked every day</a>. The same situation prevails in Germany, which also has an immense Muslim population. In Bavaria and the Alps alone, some 200 churches have been attacked and many crosses broken: &ldquo;Police are currently dealing with church desecrations again and again,&rdquo; reads one November 2017 report, before it <a href=\"https://dieunbestechlichen.com/2017/11/wieder-attacken-auf-gipfelkreuze-und-jaehrlich-200-faelle-von-kirchenschaedigungen-allein-in-bayern/\">says</a>, &ldquo;The perpetrators are often youthful rioters with a migration background.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Before Christmas 2016, in the North Rhine-Westphalia region of Germany&mdash;where <a href=\"http://www.deutsche-islam-konferenz.de/DIK/EN/Magazin/Lebenswelten/ZahlenDatenFakten/ZahlMLD/zahl-mld-node.html\">more than a million Muslims reside</a>&mdash;some <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/744379/German-Christian-statues-destroys-religious-motivated-attack-revenge-police\">50 public Christian statues</a> (including of Jesus) were beheaded and crucifixes broken. In 2015, following the arrival of another million Muslim migrants to D&uuml;lmen, a local newspaper said &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2016/11/08/christian-statues-destroyed-town/\">not a day goes by</a>&rdquo; without attacks on Christian statues.</p>\n<p>Numerical deductions aside, the fact is, the desecration of churches has for centuries been a Muslim trademark&mdash;a sort of &ldquo;Islam was here.&rdquo; As documented in my recent book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0306825554/pjmedia-20\"><i>Sword and Scimitar: Fourteen Centuries of War between Islam and the West</i></a>, whenever Muslims invaded Christian nations, untold <i>thousands</i> of churches were ritually desecrated and despoiled, their crosses and other Christian symbols systematically broken. Think what ISIS does but on an exponential level&mdash;and not for a handful of years but for over a millennium.</p>\n<p>The patterns between past and present attacks are virtually identical. Reminiscent of the recent drawing of a cross in fecal matter on a French church, in 1147 in Portugal, Muslims displayed &ldquo;with much derision the symbol of the cross. They spat upon it and wiped the feces from their posteriors with it.&rdquo; Decades earlier in Jerusalem, Muslims &ldquo;spat on them [crucifixes] and did not even refrain from urinating on them in the sight of all.&rdquo; Even that supposedly &ldquo;magnanimous&rdquo; sultan, Saladin, commanded &ldquo;whoever saw that the outside of a church was white, to cover it with black dirt,&rdquo; and ordered &ldquo;the removal of every cross from atop the dome of every church in the provinces of Egypt&rdquo; (all quotes from primary sources documented in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0306825554/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0306825554&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondibrahi-20&linkId=0f925201768b161ae319879bb3fdf1d7\"><i>Sword and Scimitar</i></a>, pp. 171, 145, 162).</p>\n<p>From the start, the intentional, widespread, and systematic targeting of churches and other Christian symbols prompted some to see Muslim invaders as motivated by a diabolical animus. For Anastasius of Sinai (630&ndash;701), the heroes of the seventh-century Arab conquests of the then Christian-majority Middle East were &ldquo;perhaps even worse than the demons.&rdquo; After all, &ldquo;the demons are frequently much afraid of the mysteries of Christ, I mean his holy body [the Eucharist], the cross... and many other things. But these demons of flesh trample all that under their feet, mock it, set fire to it, destroy it&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0306825554/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0306825554&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondibrahi-20&linkId=0f925201768b161ae319879bb3fdf1d7\"><i>Sword and Scimitar</i></a>, p. 27).</p>\n<p>Interestingly, nowadays, whenever a church attacker is exposed as a migrant, authorities and media try to downplay the incident by saying he is suffering from mental health issues (modern-day parlance for what was once seen as demonization). Others still rely on the more antiquated interpretation. During the memorial service for Father Hamel&mdash;an 85-year-old priest slaughtered by &ldquo;Allahu Akbar&rdquo; shouting Muslims while holding mass in his own church in France&mdash;Archbishop Dominique Lebrun <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/08/04/martyred-priests-last-words-jihadists-gone-satan/\">called</a> on those &ldquo;who are tormented by diabolical violence, you who are drawn to kill by a demonic, murderous madness, pray to God to free you from the devil&rsquo;s grip.&rdquo; Before his murderer carved his throat, Fr. Hamel himself had reportedly <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/08/04/martyred-priests-last-words-jihadists-gone-satan/\">shouted</a>, &ldquo;Be gone, Satan!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Considering the descriptions of some Muslim assailants, such &ldquo;otherworldly&rdquo; accusations are not farfetched. In France, April 2015, a Muslim man dressed in traditional Islamic garb <a href=\"http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/un-homme-en-garde-a-vue-apres-la-profanation-de-215-tombes-a-castres-16-04-2015-4698553.php#xtor=AD-1481423552&xtref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fdesouche.com%2F589011-castres-environ-250-tombes-vandalisees-dans-un-cimetiere-de-castres%20http://diversitymachtfrei.blogspot.com/2015/04/france-unbalanced-muslim-destroys-215.html\">damaged and desecrated</a> more than 200 Christian gravestones and crosses in a cemetery (just as ISIS and other Muslim &ldquo;radicals&rdquo; are <a href=\"https://www.raymondibrahim.com/2015/04/17/islamic-state-sledgehammers-christian-gravestones-and-crosses-in-mosul/\">known to do</a> in Libya, Iraq, Iran, and elsewhere). After he was apprehended, authorities <a href=\"http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/un-homme-en-garde-a-vue-apres-la-profanation-de-215-tombes-a-castres-16-04-2015-4698553.php#xtor=AD-1481423552&xtref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fdesouche.com%2F589011-castres-environ-250-tombes-vandalisees-dans-un-cimetiere-de-castres%20http://diversitymachtfrei.blogspot.com/2015/04/france-unbalanced-muslim-destroys-215.html\">said</a>, &ldquo;The man repeats Muslim prayers over and over, he drools and cannot be communicated with: his condition has been declared incompatible with preliminary detention.&rdquo; Similarly, around Christmas 2016 in Italy, another Muslim migrant who said he &ldquo;wanted to destroy Christian symbols&rdquo; set a church nativity scene aflame. Police fought hard to restrain the man, who was described as suffering from a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/749729/muslim-migrant-gambia-sets-fire-nativity-scene-foggia\">visible psycho-physical crisis</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In other words, not much has changed: past and present, Muslims&mdash;motivated by what has long been deemed a diabolical animus&mdash;attacked and desecrated churches, crosses, and other Christian symbols.</p>\n<p>The only difference is that, whereas Europeans used to prevent them entry, and thus safeguarded their sacred sites, today they welcome them in with open arms.</p>\n<p><b>Note</b>: For a comprehensive and well-documented overview of what Muslims did to churches throughout history, see Ibrahim&rsquo;s book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0306825554/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0306825554&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondibrahi-20&linkId=0f925201768b161ae319879bb3fdf1d7\"><i>Sword and Scimitar: Fourteen Centuries of War between Islam and the West</i></a></p>",

                "text": "As explained in this recent article, all around Western Europe, churches are under attack. Along with arson attempts, typically\u2014and rather with diabolical intent\u2014altars are desecrated, crucifixes broken, statues mocked and/or beheaded, and the churches set aflame.\nSometimes fecal matter is smeared on the churches. Last February in France, for instance, vandals plundered and used human excrement to draw a cross on the Notre-Dame des Enfants Church in Nimes; consecrated bread was found thrown outside among garbage. One week later, vandals desecrated and smashed crosses and statues at Saint-Alain Cathedral in Lavaur; they mangled the arms of a crucified Christ in a mocking manner and an altar cloth was burned.\nWhile European authorities and media usually obfuscate over the identity of the desecrators, demographics offer a clue: true to \u201cIslam\u2019s Rule of Numbers,\u201d Western European nations that have large Muslim migrant populations tend to witness the most attacks.\nThus in France, which has one of if not the largest Muslim populations in Western Europe, two churches are attacked every day. The same situation prevails in Germany, which also has an immense Muslim population. In Bavaria and the Alps alone, some 200 churches have been attacked and many crosses broken: \u201cPolice are currently dealing with church desecrations again and again,\u201d reads one November 2017 report, before it says, \u201cThe perpetrators are often youthful rioters with a migration background.\u201d\nBefore Christmas 2016, in the North Rhine-Westphalia region of Germany\u2014where more than a million Muslims reside\u2014some 50 public Christian statues (including of Jesus) were beheaded and crucifixes broken. In 2015, following the arrival of another million Muslim migrants to D\u00fclmen, a local newspaper said \u201cnot a day goes by\u201d without attacks on Christian statues.\nNumerical deductions aside, the fact is, the desecration of churches has for centuries been a Muslim trademark\u2014a sort of \u201cIslam was here.\u201d As documented in my recent book, Sword and Scimitar: Fourteen Centuries of War between Islam and the West, whenever Muslims invaded Christian nations, untold thousands of churches were ritually desecrated and despoiled, their crosses and other Christian symbols systematically broken. Think what ISIS does but on an exponential level\u2014and not for a handful of years but for over a millennium.\nThe patterns between past and present attacks are virtually identical. Reminiscent of the recent drawing of a cross in fecal matter on a French church, in 1147 in Portugal, Muslims displayed \u201cwith much derision the symbol of the cross. They spat upon it and wiped the feces from their posteriors with it.\u201d Decades earlier in Jerusalem, Muslims \u201cspat on them [crucifixes] and did not even refrain from urinating on them in the sight of all.\u201d Even that supposedly \u201cmagnanimous\u201d sultan, Saladin, commanded \u201cwhoever saw that the outside of a church was white, to cover it with black dirt,\u201d and ordered \u201cthe removal of every cross from atop the dome of every church in the provinces of Egypt\u201d (all quotes from primary sources documented in Sword and Scimitar, pp. 171, 145, 162).\nFrom the start, the intentional, widespread, and systematic targeting of churches and other Christian symbols prompted some to see Muslim invaders as motivated by a diabolical animus. For Anastasius of Sinai (630\u2013701), the heroes of the seventh-century Arab conquests of the then Christian-majority Middle East were \u201cperhaps even worse than the demons.\u201d After all, \u201cthe demons are frequently much afraid of the mysteries of Christ, I mean his holy body [the Eucharist], the cross... and many other things. But these demons of flesh trample all that under their feet, mock it, set fire to it, destroy it\u201d (Sword and Scimitar, p. 27).\nInterestingly, nowadays, whenever a church attacker is exposed as a migrant, authorities and media try to downplay the incident by saying he is suffering from mental health issues (modern-day parlance for what was once seen as demonization). Others still rely on the more antiquated interpretation. During the memorial service for Father Hamel\u2014an 85-year-old priest slaughtered by \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d shouting Muslims while holding mass in his own church in France\u2014Archbishop Dominique Lebrun called on those \u201cwho are tormented by diabolical violence, you who are drawn to kill by a demonic, murderous madness, pray to God to free you from the devil\u2019s grip.\u201d Before his murderer carved his throat, Fr. Hamel himself had reportedly shouted, \u201cBe gone, Satan!\u201d\nConsidering the descriptions of some Muslim assailants, such \u201cotherworldly\u201d accusations are not farfetched. In France, April 2015, a Muslim man dressed in traditional Islamic garb damaged and desecrated more than 200 Christian gravestones and crosses in a cemetery (just as ISIS and other Muslim \u201cradicals\u201d are known to do in Libya, Iraq, Iran, and elsewhere). After he was apprehended, authorities said, \u201cThe man repeats Muslim prayers over and over, he drools and cannot be communicated with: his condition has been declared incompatible with preliminary detention.\u201d Similarly, around Christmas 2016 in Italy, another Muslim migrant who said he \u201cwanted to destroy Christian symbols\u201d set a church nativity scene aflame. Police fought hard to restrain the man, who was described as suffering from a \u201cvisible psycho-physical crisis.\u201d\nIn other words, not much has changed: past and present, Muslims\u2014motivated by what has long been deemed a diabolical animus\u2014attacked and desecrated churches, crosses, and other Christian symbols.\nThe only difference is that, whereas Europeans used to prevent them entry, and thus safeguarded their sacred sites, today they welcome them in with open arms.\nNote: For a comprehensive and well-documented overview of what Muslims did to churches throughout history, see Ibrahim\u2019s book, Sword and Scimitar: Fourteen Centuries of War between Islam and the West",

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Last Thursday, slain rapper Nipsey Hussle was mourned in a fashion fit for a distinguished statesman: a funeral attended by 21,000 people at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, followed by a 25-mile procession, where thousands more thronged the route and showered the passing hearse with flowers and other mementos of devotion.</p>\n<p>The entire affair was streamed live on the internet, and as someone who once had a professional interest in Mr. Hussle and his associates, I checked in from time to time to see how things were progressing. As the procession brought traffic to a standstill across large sections of South L.A., I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder how Aaron Shannon&rsquo;s parents might be feeling if they had found themselves caught in the commotion.</p>\n<p>If he were alive today, Aaron Shannon would be 14 years old, and his parents, like those of many boys in certain parts of Los Angeles, would be doing their best to inoculate him against the gang culture that has brought so much death and misery to the city. How Aaron&rsquo;s parents must wish they had to face that challenge today.</p>\n<p>But Aaron Shannon is not alive today, having been <a href=\"https://homicide.latimes.com/post/aaron-shannon-jr/\">murdered in 2010</a> when he was just five years old. It was the afternoon of Halloween that year when Aaron, playing in his backyard and dressed in his Spider-Man costume, was shot in the head and killed by gang members seeking retribution for an earlier shooting. Aaron&rsquo;s grandfather and uncle were also shot that day but survived. No one in the family was affiliated with a street gang.</p>\n<p>Indeed, one need not have any direct connection to gang culture to have that culture come exploding into one&rsquo;s life as it did in Aaron&rsquo;s case. It was his fate to live in the Florence area on the west side of Central Avenue while his killers lived on the east side. Strange as it may sound to people unfamiliar with gang life, that&rsquo;s all it takes for two groups of people, who may be similar in every other observable way, to be blood enemies. Aaron&rsquo;s neighborhood was (and still is) claimed by the East Side Mad Swan Bloods, while the neighborhood to the east is home to the Kitchen Crips.</p>\n<p>Which brings us back to Nipsey Hussle and his elaborate send-off. As the procession made its way through South Los Angeles, traveling on streets familiar to me through my years with the LAPD, I recalled times when I had stood on some of those very sidewalks only a few feet away from the covered body of some young person who minutes earlier had been shot and killed. In fact, if you examine the <a href=\"https://homicide.latimes.com/officer_involved/false/year/all\">map</a> that accompanies the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>&rsquo;s Homicide Report, you can see that the procession&rsquo;s route of travel, south on Vermont Avenue, then east on Century Boulevard to Watts, then back west on Century to the city of Inglewood and north to the parking lot on Slauson Avenue where Hussle was killed, you can see that it scarcely passed a single block that hadn&rsquo;t seen at least one murder since January 1, 2000, when the <i>Times</i>&rsquo;s homicide data begins.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://static.pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/user-content/50/files/2019/04/Capture-Hyde-Park.jpg\"></img><figcaption>(Image via LA Times Homicide Report)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>And yet, as Nipsey Hussle was extolled as a local hero on Thursday, his membership in the Rollin&rsquo; 60s Neighborhood Crips was presented as something to be proud of, as though the gang were nothing but some kind of social welfare organization. It&rsquo;s true that Hussle had invested in his neighborhood, operating a clothing store, a hamburger stand, and a barber shop, but whatever good may have flowed from those enterprises is far outweighed by the damage done by the Rollin&rsquo; 60s in the years since he joined the gang at age 14. Presented nearby is a map of the Hyde Park area of Los Angeles, home to the Rollin&rsquo; 60s. The map, created by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, contains 237 dots, each one representing a person killed in the area since January 2000. Nipsey Hussle is merely the most recent and most famous of these victims.</p>\n<p>Despite the gang&rsquo;s opulent record of death and ruin, Nipsey Hussle boasted of his membership in the Rollin&rsquo; 60s, both in interviews and in the <a href=\"https://genius.com/Nipsey-hussle-grinding-all-my-life-lyrics\">lyrics</a> to his music. In doing so he merely followed the path of so many of his predecessors in the genre, which demands &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; of its performers. This brand of authenticity requires embracing the gang life and rejecting such bourgeois conventions as staying in school, confining parenthood to married couples, and, dare I add, not shooting people for the offense of living in the wrong neighborhood.</p>\n<p>Sadly, even some who have lived bourgeois lives themselves can&rsquo;t bring themselves to condemn the criminality that is integral to hip-hop music. Witness Michael Eric Dyson&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/opinion/nipsey-hussle.html\">hagiographic tribute</a> to Nipsey Hussle that appeared in the <i>New York Times</i> on April 12. In the piece, Dyson describes Hussle as, yes, a &ldquo;ghetto saint,&rdquo; and he recounts their &ldquo;epic conversation&rdquo; while seated together on a cross-country flight. &ldquo;[Hussle&rsquo;s] death is even more haunting,&rdquo; writes Dyson, &ldquo;because the love he showed took place against the backdrop of unsettling violence, both real and imagined, both in structural forces and intimate spaces, often conjured or measured by his own pen.&rdquo; Note how gang violence is thus reduced to a &ldquo;backdrop&rdquo; to Nipsey Hussle&rsquo;s saintly love rather than something he participated in and encouraged others to do so through his music.</p>\n<p>Just as disturbing is the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/obama-nipsey-hussle-funeral.html\">letter</a> Barack Obama sent to Hussle&rsquo;s family. &ldquo;While most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets and despair,&rdquo; Mr. Obama wrote, &ldquo;Nipsey saw potential.&rdquo; Again, it is indeed commendable that Hussle chose to invest some portion of his wealth in the Crenshaw community, but it is an insult to that same community when we ignore the fact that it was the Rollin&rsquo; 60s, of which Hussle remained a proud member to the day he died, that to a large degree brought about the neighborhood&rsquo;s decline in the first place.</p>\n<p>In the end, despite his fame and wealth, Nipsey Hussle became another dot on the map, a victim of the gang life that produced him and which he exploited to make himself rich. I realize there are those who will find it unseemly that a white man who spent more than thirty years with the LAPD should dare to tarnish Saint Nipsey&rsquo;s halo in this fashion. How can I possibly understand, they will ask. I understand all too well, actually, and I have no trouble remembering that those dots on the map, the ones who weren&rsquo;t rich or famous, were real people, some of whom <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2006/09/crazy-jack-dunphy/\">I saw take their last breaths</a>.</p>\n<p>The gang culture that was celebrated at Nipsey Hussle&rsquo;s funeral is a cancer in every community it touches, and it does no one a bit of good to forget it.</p>",

                "text": "Last Thursday, slain rapper Nipsey Hussle was mourned in a fashion fit for a distinguished statesman: a funeral attended by 21,000 people at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, followed by a 25-mile procession, where thousands more thronged the route and showered the passing hearse with flowers and other mementos of devotion.\nThe entire affair was streamed live on the internet, and as someone who once had a professional interest in Mr. Hussle and his associates, I checked in from time to time to see how things were progressing. As the procession brought traffic to a standstill across large sections of South L.A., I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how Aaron Shannon\u2019s parents might be feeling if they had found themselves caught in the commotion.\nIf he were alive today, Aaron Shannon would be 14 years old, and his parents, like those of many boys in certain parts of Los Angeles, would be doing their best to inoculate him against the gang culture that has brought so much death and misery to the city. How Aaron\u2019s parents must wish they had to face that challenge today.\nBut Aaron Shannon is not alive today, having been murdered in 2010 when he was just five years old. It was the afternoon of Halloween that year when Aaron, playing in his backyard and dressed in his Spider-Man costume, was shot in the head and killed by gang members seeking retribution for an earlier shooting. Aaron\u2019s grandfather and uncle were also shot that day but survived. No one in the family was affiliated with a street gang.\nIndeed, one need not have any direct connection to gang culture to have that culture come exploding into one\u2019s life as it did in Aaron\u2019s case. It was his fate to live in the Florence area on the west side of Central Avenue while his killers lived on the east side. Strange as it may sound to people unfamiliar with gang life, that\u2019s all it takes for two groups of people, who may be similar in every other observable way, to be blood enemies. Aaron\u2019s neighborhood was (and still is) claimed by the East Side Mad Swan Bloods, while the neighborhood to the east is home to the Kitchen Crips.\nWhich brings us back to Nipsey Hussle and his elaborate send-off. As the procession made its way through South Los Angeles, traveling on streets familiar to me through my years with the LAPD, I recalled times when I had stood on some of those very sidewalks only a few feet away from the covered body of some young person who minutes earlier had been shot and killed. In fact, if you examine the map that accompanies the Los Angeles Times\u2019s Homicide Report, you can see that the procession\u2019s route of travel, south on Vermont Avenue, then east on Century Boulevard to Watts, then back west on Century to the city of Inglewood and north to the parking lot on Slauson Avenue where Hussle was killed, you can see that it scarcely passed a single block that hadn\u2019t seen at least one murder since January 1, 2000, when the Times\u2019s homicide data begins.\nAnd yet, as Nipsey Hussle was extolled as a local hero on Thursday, his membership in the Rollin\u2019 60s Neighborhood Crips was presented as something to be proud of, as though the gang were nothing but some kind of social welfare organization. It\u2019s true that Hussle had invested in his neighborhood, operating a clothing store, a hamburger stand, and a barber shop, but whatever good may have flowed from those enterprises is far outweighed by the damage done by the Rollin\u2019 60s in the years since he joined the gang at age 14. Presented nearby is a map of the Hyde Park area of Los Angeles, home to the Rollin\u2019 60s. The map, created by the Los Angeles Times, contains 237 dots, each one representing a person killed in the area since January 2000. Nipsey Hussle is merely the most recent and most famous of these victims.\nDespite the gang\u2019s opulent record of death and ruin, Nipsey Hussle boasted of his membership in the Rollin\u2019 60s, both in interviews and in the lyrics to his music. In doing so he merely followed the path of so many of his predecessors in the genre, which demands \u201cauthenticity\u201d of its performers. This brand of authenticity requires embracing the gang life and rejecting such bourgeois conventions as staying in school, confining parenthood to married couples, and, dare I add, not shooting people for the offense of living in the wrong neighborhood.\nSadly, even some who have lived bourgeois lives themselves can\u2019t bring themselves to condemn the criminality that is integral to hip-hop music. Witness Michael Eric Dyson\u2019s hagiographic tribute to Nipsey Hussle that appeared in the New York Times on April 12. In the piece, Dyson describes Hussle as, yes, a \u201cghetto saint,\u201d and he recounts their \u201cepic conversation\u201d while seated together on a cross-country flight. \u201c[Hussle\u2019s] death is even more haunting,\u201d writes Dyson, \u201cbecause the love he showed took place against the backdrop of unsettling violence, both real and imagined, both in structural forces and intimate spaces, often conjured or measured by his own pen.\u201d Note how gang violence is thus reduced to a \u201cbackdrop\u201d to Nipsey Hussle\u2019s saintly love rather than something he participated in and encouraged others to do so through his music.\nJust as disturbing is the letter Barack Obama sent to Hussle\u2019s family. \u201cWhile most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets and despair,\u201d Mr. Obama wrote, \u201cNipsey saw potential.\u201d Again, it is indeed commendable that Hussle chose to invest some portion of his wealth in the Crenshaw community, but it is an insult to that same community when we ignore the fact that it was the Rollin\u2019 60s, of which Hussle remained a proud member to the day he died, that to a large degree brought about the neighborhood\u2019s decline in the first place.\nIn the end, despite his fame and wealth, Nipsey Hussle became another dot on the map, a victim of the gang life that produced him and which he exploited to make himself rich. I realize there are those who will find it unseemly that a white man who spent more than thirty years with the LAPD should dare to tarnish Saint Nipsey\u2019s halo in this fashion. How can I possibly understand, they will ask. I understand all too well, actually, and I have no trouble remembering that those dots on the map, the ones who weren\u2019t rich or famous, were real people, some of whom I saw take their last breaths.\nThe gang culture that was celebrated at Nipsey Hussle\u2019s funeral is a cancer in every community it touches, and it does no one a bit of good to forget it.",

Obama would be their perfect candidate in 2020, of course, but he can't run again because of that pesky 22nd Amendment. They're crazy about AOC, but she's not old enough yet. (It's always that damn Constitution thwarting their goals!) And none of the approximately 450 Democrats running next year have been very exciting. A lot of Dem voters really like Bernie, but he's too cranky and mean. They'd vote for Biden, sure, but they're not about to throw their panties on the stage for him. They really want to be swept off their feet. They want to devote themselves. They want to fall in love.</p>\n<p>So apparently they've settled on... Beto?</p>\n<blockquote> A giant earth artwork depicting 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O&rsquo;Rourke has appeared north of Austin, Texas. </blockquote>\n<blockquote> The two acre design dubbed &quot;Beto Earthwork&quot; was created by Kansas artist Stan Herd, and is formed mostly from gravel, sand and rock... </blockquote>\n<blockquote> &quot;We're trying to tell the story of this amazing man from Texas making a difference in the national climate,&quot; the artist explained. </blockquote>\n<p>&quot;This amazing <em>man</em>.&quot; Yeah, I don't see anybody building shrines to Kamala or Elizabeth or Amy or Kirsten. It really reminds you just how sexist this country really is, doesn't it?</p>\n<p>Take a look at it, courtesy of the artist himself:</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fstanherdarts%2Fposts%2F2129942253766044&width=500\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>The last time we heard about painted rocks in Texas, it was because we were supposed to care about <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/rick-perry-familys-hunting-camp-still-known-to-many-by-old-racially-charged-name/2011/10/01/gIQAOhY5DL_story.html?utm_term=.e683fa191292\">the old name of a hunting camp owned by Rick Perry's family</a>. If Perry had been running for president as a Democrat, the press would've dismissed that story quicker than Beto's DWI.</p>\n<p>Beto seems like a really weird guy to me. But then, so did Obama. And just as with Obama, all of Beto's odd behavior and disconcerting foibles will just become part of the myth. The press insisted it was no big deal that Beto livestreamed a trip to the dentist, and they're already racking their brains to excuse his habit of jumping up on restaurant countertops with his filthy feet. They're projecting all their hopes and dreams onto him, and they're not going to let reality spoil the party.</p>\n<p>I can't wait until Beto and Kamala go head-to-head. Are white males the source of all our problems, or aren't they? The cognitive dissonance is gonna be great!</p>\n<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I also don't like it when Republicans worship Trump, or any other politician. Even Mount Rushmore is kind of creepy, when you think about it. So if and when they start building graven monuments to Trump, I won't like that either. Okay? Okay.</p>",

                "text": "Ever since Hillary Clinton failed miserably and disappointed everybody who believed in her, Dems have been desperately seeking somebody to worship. Obama would be their perfect candidate in 2020, of course, but he can't run again because of that pesky 22nd Amendment. They're crazy about AOC, but she's not old enough yet. (It's always that damn Constitution thwarting their goals!) And none of the approximately 450 Democrats running next year have been very exciting. A lot of Dem voters really like Bernie, but he's too cranky and mean. They'd vote for Biden, sure, but they're not about to throw their panties on the stage for him. They really want to be swept off their feet. They want to devote themselves. They want to fall in love.\nSo apparently they've settled on... Beto?\nA giant earth artwork depicting 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke has appeared north of Austin, Texas.\nThe two acre design dubbed \"Beto Earthwork\" was created by Kansas artist Stan Herd, and is formed mostly from gravel, sand and rock...\n\"We're trying to tell the story of this amazing man from Texas making a difference in the national climate,\" the artist explained.\n\"This amazing man.\" Yeah, I don't see anybody building shrines to Kamala or Elizabeth or Amy or Kirsten. It really reminds you just how sexist this country really is, doesn't it?\nTake a look at it, courtesy of the artist himself:\nThe last time we heard about painted rocks in Texas, it was because we were supposed to care about the old name of a hunting camp owned by Rick Perry's family. If Perry had been running for president as a Democrat, the press would've dismissed that story quicker than Beto's DWI.\nBeto seems like a really weird guy to me. But then, so did Obama. And just as with Obama, all of Beto's odd behavior and disconcerting foibles will just become part of the myth. The press insisted it was no big deal that Beto livestreamed a trip to the dentist, and they're already racking their brains to excuse his habit of jumping up on restaurant countertops with his filthy feet. They're projecting all their hopes and dreams onto him, and they're not going to let reality spoil the party.\nI can't wait until Beto and Kamala go head-to-head. Are white males the source of all our problems, or aren't they? The cognitive dissonance is gonna be great!\nP.S. I also don't like it when Republicans worship Trump, or any other politician. Even Mount Rushmore is kind of creepy, when you think about it. So if and when they start building graven monuments to Trump, I won't like that either. Okay? Okay.",

They also reported cash on hand of $40.8 million, swamping the president's nearest Democratic challenger, Bernie Sanders.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The president is in a vastly stronger position at this point than any previous incumbent president running for re-election, and only continues to build momentum,&rdquo; said Trump re-election campaign manager Brad Parscale.</p>\n<blockquote> Among the Democrats, Sanders is on top when it comes to the amount of cash raised and the amount of money in the bank. The Independent from Vermont, who&rsquo;s making his second straight bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, reported raising $18.2 million, with $28 million cash on hand, having transferred money left over from his 2018 Senate re-election bid.  <p>Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported raising $12 million. So did former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, who&rsquo;s considered a long-shot for the nomination. But $11.7 million of that haul was an infusion of cash from the candidate, who&rsquo;s a self-made multi-millionaire.</p> <p>Former Rep. Beto O&rsquo;Rourke of Texas raised an eye-popping $9.4 million during the first 18 days of his campaign, with $6.1 million of the haul coming in the first 24 hours after declaring his candidacy.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Trump filed for re-election the day he was inaugurated, giving him an enormous advantage over his rivals. But perhaps more significantly from a political standpoint, Donald Trump showed just who is the candidate of the &quot;little guy.&quot;</p>\n<blockquote> The Trump campaign touted its small-dollar grassroots appeal, announcing that 98.79 percent of first-quarter contributions were $200 or less, and that the average donation to the campaign was $34.26. </blockquote>\n<p>Now perhaps some naysayers in the Republican Party will understand why the Democrats are being given only a 50-50 chance of beating Trump. By the time this race is over, Trump is likely to have raised more than double what he spent in 2016 to get elected. With Democrats locked in a death struggle between the various wings of their party, whichever candidate emerges as the nominee will likely be tapped out. Meanwhile, Trump will be running virtually unopposed and will be able to harness his resources and drop massive amounts of cash in battleground states, and maybe even pick off a blue state or two he narrowly lost in 2o16 -- like Minnesota.</p>\n<blockquote> Now President Trump sees the state as a personal challenge heading into the 2020 election, and his campaign is making it an early target.  <p>No Republican presidential candidate has claimed the state's 10 Electoral College votes since Richard Nixon in 1972 &mdash; the longest blue streak in the United States.</p> <p>Trump acknowledged the Democratic hold on Minnesota during a <a data-pjax=\"true\" href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/04/15/trump-using-tax-day-visit-minnesota-to-tout-2017-tax-cuts\">quick stop there Monday to tout his signature tax law.</a></p> <p>&quot;This has been a very special state.

Thus they came to discover that at one point during the twenty-minute speech Omar had referred, in passing, to the terrorists of 9/11 as &ldquo;some people&rdquo; that &ldquo;did something.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gotcha!</p>\n<p>Instantly, flames began to burst out of rightwing outrage silos. On Friday night, President Donald Trump mainstreamed the line of attack by posting a video of Omar repeatedly saying &ldquo;some people did something&rdquo; and then showing gruesome images of the 9/11 attack.</p>\n<p>The next day, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/politicalelle/status/1116757289245872128\">retweeted</a> someone calling Omar a &ldquo;sick monster.&rdquo; On Tuesday, Trump continued his attack <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/4/16/18395065/trump-ilhan-omar-death-threats\">saying</a>, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a way about her that&rsquo;s very, very bad&rdquo; and called the former Americorps member &ldquo;unpatriotic.&rdquo; All this has, predictably, led to numerous <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47938268\">death threats</a> against Omar and other Muslim lawmakers.</p>\n<p>The extent to which Omar&rsquo;s comments are taken out of context is breathtaking, even for Trump.</p>\n<p>Ironically, Omar&rsquo;s address to CAIR took place shortly after a terrorist who professed a <a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/new-zealand-mosques-shooting-suspect-called-trump-a-sym-1833323711\">Trump-influenced</a> terrorism who <a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/new-zealand-mosques-shooting-suspect-called-trump-a-sym-1833323711\">hailed</a> Trump as a &ldquo;symbol of white supremacy&rdquo; slaughtered fifty people in attacks on two New Zealand mosques. Omar was offering hope to a room full of frightened Muslims.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are coming off a tragic, tragic nightmare that has happened to Muslims in New Zealand,&rdquo; Omar <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7INpvY0J0RI\">said</a> in her speech. &ldquo;Many of you know this not a one-off incident. Many of us were not shocked or surprised.

Thus they came to discover that at one point during the twenty-minute speech Omar had referred, in passing, to the terrorists of 9/11 as \u201csome people\u201d that \u201cdid something.\u201d\nGotcha!\nInstantly, flames began to burst out of rightwing outrage silos. On Friday night, President Donald Trump mainstreamed the line of attack by posting a video of Omar repeatedly saying \u201csome people did something\u201d and then showing gruesome images of the 9/11 attack.\nThe next day, Trump retweeted someone calling Omar a \u201csick monster.\u201d On Tuesday, Trump continued his attack saying, \u201cShe\u2019s got a way about her that\u2019s very, very bad\u201d and called the former Americorps member \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d All this has, predictably, led to numerous death threats against Omar and other Muslim lawmakers.\nThe extent to which Omar\u2019s comments are taken out of context is breathtaking, even for Trump.\nIronically, Omar\u2019s address to CAIR took place shortly after a terrorist who professed a Trump-influenced terrorism who hailed Trump as a \u201csymbol of white supremacy\u201d slaughtered fifty people in attacks on two New Zealand mosques. Omar was offering hope to a room full of frightened Muslims.\n\u201cWe are coming off a tragic, tragic nightmare that has happened to Muslims in New Zealand,\u201d Omar said in her speech. \u201cMany of you know this not a one-off incident. Many of us were not shocked or surprised. Many of us were holding our breath for a really long time thinking \u2018when will something like this happen?\u2019 Because many of us have experienced threats in our mosques, in our schools, and toward our leaders. Many of have witnessed bombing of mosques. Many of us have seen mosques set on fire.\u201d\nShe rightly laid blame for this anti-Muslim climate at Trump\u2019s feet, but urged her fellow Muslims to fight back with love.\n\u201c[Trump] knows there are people that he can influence, to threaten our lives and to diminish our presence,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, what we know, what Islam teaches and I always say, is that love trumps hate.\u201d\nHow does love conquer hate? The Congresswoman tells her audience that love is not simply working to \u201cnot bother anyone\u201d and \u201cbe a good Muslim,\u201d because history has proven that isn\u2019t enough.\n\u201cNo matter how much we have tried to be the best neighbor, people have always worked on finding a way to not allow for every single civil liberty to be extended to us,\u201d she said. Omar reminds her listeners, \u201cAs Muslims, we are called upon for justice and to speak the truth, even if it is against ourselves,\u201d Omar said. \u201cWe must hold people we love, and have shared values with, accountable.\u201d\nThe part that Trump intentionally took out of context is a passage where she points out the absurdity of punishing an entire group because of the actions of a few:\n\u201cFor far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen, and frankly I\u2019m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\"\nIt is a phrasing not much different than what white, Christian male politicians have used without anyone throwing a hissy fit.\nFor instance, this is what George W. Bush said at Ground Zero shortly after the 9/11 attacks: \u201cThe people\u2014and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon!\u201d\nThe \u201cpeople\u201d? Oh, the insensitivity!\nTwo days after 9/11,Trump was asked how the United States should respond. This is what he said: \u201cThey have to find out exactly what the cause was, who did it, and they have to go after these people.\u201d\nA few days later Trump appeared on The Howard Stern Show and was asked about investing in the stock market. \u201cThe stock market I think is going to be quite good over the next few years, but you know the real terror of the stock market is that if you have another incident, even a much smaller one\u201a I can't imagine a much bigger one\u2014it\u2019s so sensitive right now that something like that would really knock the hell out of it.\u201d\nOf course, nobody called him unpatriotic for referring to 9/11 as an \u201cincident\u201d and \u201csomething.\u201d But then, Trump is not a Muslim woman.",

As the &ldquo;Four Necessity Valve Turners,&rdquo; we felt compelled to take this necessary, nonviolent action in the face of the imminent threat of the climate crisis &ndash; which, according the United Nations&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">October 2018 report</a>, requires an immediate response.</p>\n<p>Given the dramatic failure by governmental bodies to adequately respond to this threat, we felt, as people of faith, that we had to act. Our intent was to responsibly call for a &ldquo;timeout&rdquo; from the pumping of poison through the heart of Mother Earth.</p>\n<p>Our group &ndash; which besides myself includes Brenna Cussen-Anglada, Allyson Polman and Daniel Yildirim &ndash; was fully informed of the safest way to proceed with the shutdown process. We put no one in danger.

Proposed by Canadian energy giant Enbridge Energy, the line would <a href=\"https://mn.gov/puc/line3/summary/\">move</a> 760,000 barrels per day of tar sands crude from Alberta to a terminal in Superior, Wisconsin, to be made available to foreign markets.</p>\n<p>As a Minnesota resident and Sierra Club volunteer opposing Line 3, I was deeply disappointed by this commission&rsquo;s decision.

Portions of the new Line 3 would be <a href=\"https://healingmnstories.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/line_3_hte_map.png\">rerouted</a> to avoid crossing the Leech Lake Reservation, due in part to <a href=\"https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/opinion/leech-lake-band-opposes-line-3-pipeline-through-reservation-VulZE0gOl0CypslMPfvl3Q/\">indigenous opposition</a>. The reroute also allows the company to <a href=\"https://www.enbridge.com/~/media/www/Site%20Documents/Delivering%20Energy/Line%203%20Replacement%20Project%20FAQs\">continue</a> using the old line during construction of the new.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A multi-agency task force has been stockpiling equipment and training police in preparation for Line 3 pipeline protests in coordination between law enforcement agencies from Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Resistance to Enbridge&rsquo;s plans has included <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/minnesota/blog/2017/06/hundreds-opposed-line-3-tar-sands-pipeline-flood-st-paul-public-hearing\">packed</a> public hearings, as well as <a href=\"https://www.bemidjipioneer.com/news/government-and-politics/4492202-updated-line-3-protesters-hold-rally-block-streets-downtown\">rallies</a> and <a href=\"https://dgrnewsservice.org/resistance/indirect/symbolic/water-ceremony-shuts-down-line-3-construction-on-mississippi-river/\">protests</a> along the route and in the Twin Cities.

Documents show coordination between various law enforcement agencies from states across the region including Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota.</p>\n<p>Minnesota Administrative Law Judge Ann O&rsquo;Reilly has overseen much of Line 3&rsquo;s lengthy case hearings, a quasi-judicial process to gather expert testimony and hold public hearings. In April 2018, she issued a 436-page <a href=\"https://www.edockets.state.mn.us/EFiling/edockets/searchDocuments.do?method=showPoup&documentId=%7b509CF762-0000-C814-82DD-F07DDE37A08D%7d&documentTitle=20184-142238-01\">report</a>. She concluded that among the route options presented, the only way the costs would outweigh the benefits would be if Enbridge rebuilt Line 3 along the existing route. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission&rsquo;s decision departs in significant ways from O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s report, forming part of the basis for legal challenges currently before the Minnesota Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>The Red Lake Band of Chippewa, the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, Honor the Earth, and the Sierra Club filed a <a href=\"https://healingmnstories.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/hte-et-al-appeal-line-3.pdf\">joint appeal</a>. Separate appeals have also been filed by <a href=\"https://www.edockets.state.mn.us/EFiling/edockets/searchDocuments.do?method=showPoup&documentId=%7b408FCD67-0000-CA12-8264-047112BC7FFD%7d&documentTitle=201812-148629-01\">Friends of the Headwaters</a>, the <a href=\"https://healingmnstories.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/doc-line-3-appeal.pdf\">Minnesota Department of Commerce</a>, and the <a href=\"https://healingmnstories.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/youth-climate-intervenors-appeal.pdf\">Youth Climate Intervenors</a>.</p>\n<p>A central issue uniting the resistance is the project&rsquo;s fossil-fuel impact on climate. The crude oil in Line 3 would <a href=\"https://healingmnstories.wordpress.com/2019/02/12/walz-administration-to-continue-legal-challenge-against-enbridge-line-3-pipeline/\">cause</a> $287 billion in climate damage over three decades, according an environmental impact <a href=\"https://mn.gov/commerce/energyfacilities/resource.html?Id=34776\">statement</a> created by the Minnesota Commerce Department. The public utilities commissions, in response, <a href=\"https://healingmnstories.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/puc-order-cn.pdf\">argued</a> that these &ldquo;costs do not result directly from the Project, but instead result from the continued demand for crude oil to produce refined products used by consumers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But such a contention ignores that not all energy sources have the same environmental impact; tar sands oil is among the absolute dirtiest ways to address energy needs.</p>\n<p>The project also poses its own significant risks for the environment. Line 3 would <a href=\"http://friendsoftheheadwaters.org/index.html\">run</a> under the Mississippi River twice, including at the headwaters region. It would <a href=\"https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/wq-wwprm1-52g.pdf\">cross</a> 211 streams and seventy-eight linear miles of wetlands, according to Enbridge documents.</p>\n<p>Indigenous communities are especially <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/wild-rice-waters-a-big-reason-indian-tribes-oppose-enbridge-pipeline-project/448755803/\">concerned</a> about oil spills damaging wild rice beds.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Reilly, the administrative law judge, <a href=\"https://www.edockets.state.mn.us/EFiling/edockets/searchDocuments.do?method=showPoup&documentId=%7b509CF762-0000-C814-82DD-F07DDE37A08D%7d&documentTitle=20184-142238-01\">recommended against</a> Enbridge&rsquo;s preferred route, saying the company had failed to show the benefits outweighed the costs. The Minnesota Department of Commerce also <a href=\"https://healingmnstories.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/doc-line-3-appeal.pdf\">argued</a> that Enbridge failed to prove the pipeline was needed, a key first step for considering the project.</p>\n<p>Commissioners justified their Line 3 vote by saying they worried that Enbridge would keep running its old and failing pipeline if they didn&rsquo;t approve the new one, increasing the danger of a catastrophic spill. One Commissioner <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/06/28/enbridge-line-3-minnesota-support-public-utilities-commission\">described</a> the Line 3 vote as having a &ldquo;gun to our head.&rdquo; (The largest inland crude oil spill in U.S. history happened in 1991 near Grand Rapids, Minnesota, when a Lakehead Pipeline <a href=\"https://www.grandrapidsmn.com/opinion/happy-anniversary-the-largest-inland-oil-spill-in-u-s/article_2ade2706-004f-11e7-9023-2b31a01741a6.html\">spilled</a> 1.7 million gallons into the Prairie River. That pipeline is now part of Enbridge&rsquo;s mainline system.)</p>\n<p>The proposed Line 3 route also conflicts with treaty rights. It would cross land ceded by the Anishinaabe people (Ojibwe and Chippewa) to the U.S. government, but on which various bands claim treaty-protected rights to hunt, fish, and gather. The U.S. Supreme Court case, <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1998/97-1337\"><em>Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians</em></a> sets a precedent for such a claim.</p>\n<p>With legal challenges pending, Enbridge <a href=\"https://mn.gov/gov-stat/pdf/2018_06_28_FACTSHEET_permit_process_pipeline.pdf\">still needs</a> several state and federal permits before it can start building, including water crossing permits from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, which <a href=\"https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/2019_Permitting%20timeline_MPCA.pdf\">says</a> a final decision isn&rsquo;t expected until late October.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Canada is seeking to increase crude oil exports to foreign markets but lacks the pipeline infrastructure to make this happen. Line 3 is a critical link.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>With all the delays, Line 3 <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/enbridge-pipeline-project-to-be-delayed-a-year/506609372/\">won&rsquo;t be running</a> until mid-2020 at the earliest. And this presents a big problem for Canada, which is seeking to increase crude oil exports but lacks the pipeline infrastructure to make this happen. TransCanada&rsquo;s Energy East pipeline would have <a href=\"https://www.transcanada.com/en/announcements/2014/2014-10-30%2412-billion-energy-east-pipeline-project-takes-important-step-forward-with-neb-application-filing/\">linked</a> the Alberta oil fields to refineries all the way to New Brunswick. It was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/business/canada-energy-east-pipeline.html\">scrapped</a> in 2017, though efforts are underway to <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/new-brunswick-energy-east-1.4934168\">revive it.</a></p>\n<p>Enbridge proposed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enbridge_Northern_Gateway_Pipelines\">building</a> the Northern Gateway Pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia. That <a href=\"https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/resources/19184\">failed</a> to get government approval. Kinder Morgan tried to <a href=\"https://www.transmountain.com/\">build</a> the Trans Mountain pipeline, also from Alberta to British Columbia. When it stalled in the face of public opposition, the government of Prime Minister Trudeau <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kindermorgan-cn-pipeline/canada-to-buy-kinder-morgan-oil-pipeline-in-bid-to-save-project-idUSKCN1IU1MR\">bought the pipeline</a> in 2018 to try to move it forward. The courts <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-pipeline/canada-wont-appeal-ruling-that-overturned-pipeline-to-consult-more-idUSKCN1MD1MC\">blocked</a> Trans Mountain last fall.</p>\n<p>But Canada is not giving up. Amarjeet Sohi, Canada&rsquo;s minister of natural resources, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/sohi-perry-kxl-line-3-1.5055490\">met</a> this month with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Houston to discuss ways to make both TransCanada&rsquo;s Keystone XL project and Enbridge&rsquo;s Line 3 replacement pipeline a reality.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in Minnesota, Line 3 is testing newly elected Democratic Governor Tim Walz&rsquo;s ability to navigate difficult political waters. The project, which Enbridge says would <a href=\"https://www.enbridge.com/projects-and-infrastructure/public-awareness/minnesota-projects/line-3-replacement-project\">create</a> 8,600 jobs over two years, including 4,200 union construction jobs, is <a href=\"https://www.edockets.state.mn.us/EFiling/edockets/searchDocuments.do?method=showPoup&documentId=%7b7054765E-0000-C3B7-B56F-102DE7383B57%7d&documentTitle=20179-135424-06\">backed</a> by the Laborers District Council of Minnesota and North Dakota.</p>\n<p>During the 2018 gubernatorial campaign, Walz said he supported the public utility commission process. But as a <em>Star Tribune</em> story <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/next-minnesota-governor-will-face-big-pipeline-decision/498366121/\">noted</a>, &ldquo;Walz&rsquo;s position on Enbridge has not always been clear. His running mate Representative Peggy Flanagan&mdash;a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe&mdash;fought the pipeline in the Legislature, in part because its planned route runs through American Indian treaty lands in northern Minnesota.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Previous Governor Mark Dayton, also a Democrat, had stayed neutral until his waning days in office, when his Department of Commerce <a href=\"https://healingmnstories.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/doc-line-3-appeal.pdf\">filed suit</a> opposing Line 3. Enbridge, Dayton <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2018/other/181224/governor/newsroom/index997b.htm\">said</a> in a statement, &ldquo;failed to demonstrate that Minnesota needs this pipeline to meet our future oil demand. In fact, most of the product would flow through our state to supply other states and countries.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Walz has <a href=\"https://mn.gov/governor/news/#/detail/appId/1/id/372989\">announced</a> his support for that action, saying &ldquo;projects like these don&rsquo;t only need a building permit to go forward, they also need a social permit.&rdquo; Added his lieutenant governor, Peggy Flanagan, &ldquo;The decision to continue the Dayton Administration&rsquo;s appeal will help ensure that Minnesota&rsquo;s permitting process is clear, thorough, and fair.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.pubservice.com/subnew1page.aspx?PC=tp&pk=MHOL18\"><img alt=\"Fighting Bob piece of me\" data-src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/13411/download/You%20want%20a%20piece%20of%20me_%20%28gif%29.gif?cb=c9438933ff553df2e5bbcfc1793d8dbf&w={width}&h={height}\" data-widths=\"[864]\" sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/13411/download/You%20want%20a%20piece%20of%20me_%20%28gif%29.gif?cb=c9438933ff553df2e5bbcfc1793d8dbf&w={width}&h={height}\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.pubservice.com/subnew1page.aspx?PC=tp&pk=MHOL18\">Fighting Bob piece of me</a></figcaption></figure>",

Proposed by Canadian energy giant Enbridge Energy, the line would move 760,000 barrels per day of tar sands crude from Alberta to a terminal in Superior, Wisconsin, to be made available to foreign markets.\nAs a Minnesota resident and Sierra Club volunteer opposing Line 3, I was deeply disappointed by this commission\u2019s decision. But efforts to stop the project are far from over.\nLine 3 opponents are suing to overturn the approval in the Minnesota Court of Appeals, and challenging the state and federal permits that Enbridge needs before it can begin work.\nThe construction would replace an old, and failing, Line 3 with a new and larger pipeline running 337 miles from Minnesota\u2019s northwest corner to an existing Enbridge terminal in Superior, Wisconsin. Portions of the new Line 3 would be rerouted to avoid crossing the Leech Lake Reservation, due in part to indigenous opposition. The reroute also allows the company to continue using the old line during construction of the new.\nA multi-agency task force has been stockpiling equipment and training police in preparation for Line 3 pipeline protests in coordination between law enforcement agencies from Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota.\nResistance to Enbridge\u2019s plans has included packed public hearings, as well as rallies and protests along the route and in the Twin Cities. Dozens of opponents have been given citations and arrested for direct actions at construction sites. This has been particularly true in Wisconsin, where Enbridge built a short Line 3 segment from the Minnesota border to Superior.\nAccording to The Intercept, Minnesota law enforcement is gearing up for a major standoff over Enbridge Line 3, including a coordinated effort to identify potential anti-pipeline camps and monitor individual protesters, repeatedly turning for guidance to the North Dakota officials responsible for the militarized response at Standing Rock in 2016.\nMeanwhile, as the website Unicorn Riot has reported, a multi-agency task force has been stockpiling equipment and training police in preparation for Line 3 pipeline protests across the state. Documents show coordination between various law enforcement agencies from states across the region including Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota.\nMinnesota Administrative Law Judge Ann O\u2019Reilly has overseen much of Line 3\u2019s lengthy case hearings, a quasi-judicial process to gather expert testimony and hold public hearings. In April 2018, she issued a 436-page report. She concluded that among the route options presented, the only way the costs would outweigh the benefits would be if Enbridge rebuilt Line 3 along the existing route. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission\u2019s decision departs in significant ways from O\u2019Reilly\u2019s report, forming part of the basis for legal challenges currently before the Minnesota Court of Appeals.\nThe Red Lake Band of Chippewa, the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, Honor the Earth, and the Sierra Club filed a joint appeal. Separate appeals have also been filed by Friends of the Headwaters, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, and the Youth Climate Intervenors.\nA central issue uniting the resistance is the project\u2019s fossil-fuel impact on climate. The crude oil in Line 3 would cause $287 billion in climate damage over three decades, according an environmental impact statement created by the Minnesota Commerce Department. The public utilities commissions, in response, argued that these \u201ccosts do not result directly from the Project, but instead result from the continued demand for crude oil to produce refined products used by consumers.\u201d\nBut such a contention ignores that not all energy sources have the same environmental impact; tar sands oil is among the absolute dirtiest ways to address energy needs.\nThe project also poses its own significant risks for the environment. Line 3 would run under the Mississippi River twice, including at the headwaters region. It would cross 211 streams and seventy-eight linear miles of wetlands, according to Enbridge documents.\nIndigenous communities are especially concerned about oil spills damaging wild rice beds.\nO\u2019Reilly, the administrative law judge, recommended against Enbridge\u2019s preferred route, saying the company had failed to show the benefits outweighed the costs. The Minnesota Department of Commerce also argued that Enbridge failed to prove the pipeline was needed, a key first step for considering the project.\nCommissioners justified their Line 3 vote by saying they worried that Enbridge would keep running its old and failing pipeline if they didn\u2019t approve the new one, increasing the danger of a catastrophic spill. One Commissioner described the Line 3 vote as having a \u201cgun to our head.\u201d (The largest inland crude oil spill in U.S. history happened in 1991 near Grand Rapids, Minnesota, when a Lakehead Pipeline spilled 1.7 million gallons into the Prairie River. That pipeline is now part of Enbridge\u2019s mainline system.)\nThe proposed Line 3 route also conflicts with treaty rights. It would cross land ceded by the Anishinaabe people (Ojibwe and Chippewa) to the U.S. government, but on which various bands claim treaty-protected rights to hunt, fish, and gather. The U.S. Supreme Court case, Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians sets a precedent for such a claim.\nWith legal challenges pending, Enbridge still needs several state and federal permits before it can start building, including water crossing permits from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, which says a final decision isn\u2019t expected until late October.\nCanada is seeking to increase crude oil exports to foreign markets but lacks the pipeline infrastructure to make this happen. Line 3 is a critical link.\nWith all the delays, Line 3 won\u2019t be running until mid-2020 at the earliest. And this presents a big problem for Canada, which is seeking to increase crude oil exports but lacks the pipeline infrastructure to make this happen. TransCanada\u2019s Energy East pipeline would have linked the Alberta oil fields to refineries all the way to New Brunswick. It was scrapped in 2017, though efforts are underway to revive it.\nEnbridge proposed building the Northern Gateway Pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia. That failed to get government approval. Kinder Morgan tried to build the Trans Mountain pipeline, also from Alberta to British Columbia. When it stalled in the face of public opposition, the government of Prime Minister Trudeau bought the pipeline in 2018 to try to move it forward. The courts blocked Trans Mountain last fall.\nBut Canada is not giving up. Amarjeet Sohi, Canada\u2019s minister of natural resources, met this month with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Houston to discuss ways to make both TransCanada\u2019s Keystone XL project and Enbridge\u2019s Line 3 replacement pipeline a reality.\nMeanwhile, in Minnesota, Line 3 is testing newly elected Democratic Governor Tim Walz\u2019s ability to navigate difficult political waters. The project, which Enbridge says would create 8,600 jobs over two years, including 4,200 union construction jobs, is backed by the Laborers District Council of Minnesota and North Dakota.\nDuring the 2018 gubernatorial campaign, Walz said he supported the public utility commission process. But as a Star Tribune story noted, \u201cWalz\u2019s position on Enbridge has not always been clear. His running mate Representative Peggy Flanagan\u2014a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe\u2014fought the pipeline in the Legislature, in part because its planned route runs through American Indian treaty lands in northern Minnesota.\u201d\nPrevious Governor Mark Dayton, also a Democrat, had stayed neutral until his waning days in office, when his Department of Commerce filed suit opposing Line 3. Enbridge, Dayton said in a statement, \u201cfailed to demonstrate that Minnesota needs this pipeline to meet our future oil demand. In fact, most of the product would flow through our state to supply other states and countries.\u201d\nWalz has announced his support for that action, saying \u201cprojects like these don\u2019t only need a building permit to go forward, they also need a social permit.\u201d Added his lieutenant governor, Peggy Flanagan, \u201cThe decision to continue the Dayton Administration\u2019s appeal will help ensure that Minnesota\u2019s permitting process is clear, thorough, and fair.\u201d",

                "html": "<p>If you&rsquo;re curious about the future of American conservatism, a good person to consider might be Ben Shapiro. The thirty-five-year-old conservative author hosts one of the country&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.podcastone.com/the-ben-shapiro-show\">most popular podcasts</a>, and clips from his frequent television appearances and public speeches have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnQC_G5Xsjhp9fEJKuIcrSw\">racked up</a> millions of views on YouTube.</p>\n<p>In debate appearances, which Shapiro doesn&rsquo;t shy away from, he&rsquo;s effective and entertaining; in life, with unfailing observance of the Sabbath (Shapiro&rsquo;s Jewish) and a very public decision not to have sex before marriage, he&rsquo;s about as steadfast in his beliefs as a public figure can get. Regardless of your politics, it&rsquo;s easy to understand Shapiro&rsquo;s appeal&mdash;he&rsquo;s intelligent, collected, and consistent.</p>\n<p>His career, however, hasn&rsquo;t been without controversy. His <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-ra-transgender-zoey-tur-20150724-column.html\">confrontation</a> with transgender broadcaster Zoey Tur on &ldquo;The Dr. Drew Show&rdquo; led to allegations of transphobia, and policing for protests to a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-ra-transgender-zoey-tur-20150724-column.html\">2017 speech he gave at UC Berkeley</a> ended up costing the city $600,000.</p>\n<p>Yet Shapiro is not uniformly hated by the left, and his podcast has significant across-the-aisle appeal. Audience members at his talks often profess their admiration for Shapiro before going on to raise points of disagreement.</p>\n<p>It would be wrong, however, to overlook just how extreme some of Shapiro&rsquo;s views are, or how muddled is the thinking on which they are based. His new book, <em>The Right Side of History</em>, was released in mid-March and soon landed on <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/\">best sellers list</a>. It argues that America is undergoing a profound and unprecedented moral crisis due to a continuous drift, centuries in the making, from the Founding Fathers&rsquo; values.</p>\n<p>These values, according to Shapiro, come from an amalgamation of two belief systems: Judeo-Christian morality and classical Greek philosophy&mdash;or, as is reiterated throughout the book, &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; and &ldquo;Athens,&rdquo; or &ldquo;revelation&rdquo; and &ldquo;reason.&rdquo; In one of his shortest descriptions of how this philosophical synthesis functions, Shapiro writes, &ldquo;God orders us to use reason, and reason impels use to discover the natural-laws designed by God.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Shapiro believes no philosophical system has allowed for a higher degree of human flourishing than that of the Founders, and he spends much of the book demonstrating&mdash;through a historical rundown of Western moral and political thinking that begins in 1313 B.C. with God&rsquo;s revelation to Moses&mdash;how Thomas Jefferson and the other Founders arrived at moral-philosophical perfection and how we&rsquo;ve been deviating from this perfection ever since.</p>\n<p>As a podcaster and speaker, Shapiro is concise, engaging, and often convincing. But, as a writer, at least in <em>The Right Side of History</em>, he&rsquo;s vague, dull, and self-contradictory. The book is loaded with spurious arguments, and from cover to cover Shapiro evades the most difficult&mdash;and often most obvious&mdash;questions that arise from his theory.</p>\n<p>We can begin with the book&rsquo;s premise. Why does Shapiro think we&rsquo;re in the midst of a moral crisis? He dedicates all of four pages to the question, giving one statistic after another but, in nearly every instance, neglecting to probe them.</p>\n<p>Shapiro warns us that marriage and birth rates are on the decline, evidently assuming the reader will agree this suggests that something&rsquo;s gravely amiss in society. He writes that 30 percent of Americans don&rsquo;t trust public schools but doesn&rsquo;t explain why this is indicative of a moral crisis and not just a wanting education system. We also learn that suicide rates are the highest in decades; but implicit in this is that these rates were once as high as they are now, which undercuts his argument that today&rsquo;s rate is evidence of something unique in America&rsquo;s history.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The book is filled with casual cheap shots more befitting a five-minute TV segment than a serious work of history or political philosophy.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>It is only deep into the book that Shapiro confronts the uncomfortable fact that the men who brought the United States to his putative philosophical high-water mark also circumscribed the rights of blacks and women. He tells us, &ldquo;the founding was rife with contradiction,&rdquo; but then, instead of confronting this idea head on, pointlessly quotes Jefferson, Madison, and Frederick Douglas before closing the chapter.</p>\n<p>The book is also filled with casual cheap shots more befitting a five-minute TV segment than a serious work of history or political philosophy. He writes at one point, &ldquo;Sounding a lot like Bernie Sanders, Lenin wrote in 1917, &lsquo;Democracy for an insignificant minority, democracy for the rich&mdash;that is the democracy of capitalist society.&rsquo; &rdquo; By linking Sanders&mdash;who Shapiro sees as a symptom of our ceaseless deviation from the Founder&rsquo;s values&mdash;to an utterly anodyne quote from Lenin, Shapiro seems to hope the reader will draw a moral equivalency between the Senator and the Chairman.</p>\n<p>There are hints of an interesting argument scattered throughout <em>The Right Side of History</em>, but they sit in logical isolation. While it&rsquo;s possible that Shapiro&rsquo;s more hardcore fans will end up mistaking the book&rsquo;s shallow philosophical analysis for intellectual profundity, less gullible readers will find its argument crumbling, fragment by half-baked fragment.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.pubservice.com/subnew1page.aspx?PC=tp&pk=MHOL18\"><img alt=\"Fighting Bob piece of me\" data-src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/13411/download/You%20want%20a%20piece%20of%20me_%20%28gif%29.gif?cb=c9438933ff553df2e5bbcfc1793d8dbf&w={width}&h={height}\" data-widths=\"[864]\" sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/13411/download/You%20want%20a%20piece%20of%20me_%20%28gif%29.gif?cb=c9438933ff553df2e5bbcfc1793d8dbf&w={width}&h={height}\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.pubservice.com/subnew1page.aspx?PC=tp&pk=MHOL18\">Fighting Bob piece of me</a></figcaption></figure>",

                "text": "If you\u2019re curious about the future of American conservatism, a good person to consider might be Ben Shapiro. The thirty-five-year-old conservative author hosts one of the country\u2019s most popular podcasts, and clips from his frequent television appearances and public speeches have racked up millions of views on YouTube.\nIn debate appearances, which Shapiro doesn\u2019t shy away from, he\u2019s effective and entertaining; in life, with unfailing observance of the Sabbath (Shapiro\u2019s Jewish) and a very public decision not to have sex before marriage, he\u2019s about as steadfast in his beliefs as a public figure can get. Regardless of your politics, it\u2019s easy to understand Shapiro\u2019s appeal\u2014he\u2019s intelligent, collected, and consistent.\nHis career, however, hasn\u2019t been without controversy. His confrontation with transgender broadcaster Zoey Tur on \u201cThe Dr. Drew Show\u201d led to allegations of transphobia, and policing for protests to a 2017 speech he gave at UC Berkeley ended up costing the city $600,000.\nYet Shapiro is not uniformly hated by the left, and his podcast has significant across-the-aisle appeal. Audience members at his talks often profess their admiration for Shapiro before going on to raise points of disagreement.\nIt would be wrong, however, to overlook just how extreme some of Shapiro\u2019s views are, or how muddled is the thinking on which they are based. His new book, The Right Side of History, was released in mid-March and soon landed on The New York Times best sellers list. It argues that America is undergoing a profound and unprecedented moral crisis due to a continuous drift, centuries in the making, from the Founding Fathers\u2019 values.\nThese values, according to Shapiro, come from an amalgamation of two belief systems: Judeo-Christian morality and classical Greek philosophy\u2014or, as is reiterated throughout the book, \u201cJerusalem\u201d and \u201cAthens,\u201d or \u201crevelation\u201d and \u201creason.\u201d In one of his shortest descriptions of how this philosophical synthesis functions, Shapiro writes, \u201cGod orders us to use reason, and reason impels use to discover the natural-laws designed by God.\u201d\nShapiro believes no philosophical system has allowed for a higher degree of human flourishing than that of the Founders, and he spends much of the book demonstrating\u2014through a historical rundown of Western moral and political thinking that begins in 1313 B.C. with God\u2019s revelation to Moses\u2014how Thomas Jefferson and the other Founders arrived at moral-philosophical perfection and how we\u2019ve been deviating from this perfection ever since.\nAs a podcaster and speaker, Shapiro is concise, engaging, and often convincing. But, as a writer, at least in The Right Side of History, he\u2019s vague, dull, and self-contradictory. The book is loaded with spurious arguments, and from cover to cover Shapiro evades the most difficult\u2014and often most obvious\u2014questions that arise from his theory.\nWe can begin with the book\u2019s premise. Why does Shapiro think we\u2019re in the midst of a moral crisis? He dedicates all of four pages to the question, giving one statistic after another but, in nearly every instance, neglecting to probe them.\nShapiro warns us that marriage and birth rates are on the decline, evidently assuming the reader will agree this suggests that something\u2019s gravely amiss in society. He writes that 30 percent of Americans don\u2019t trust public schools but doesn\u2019t explain why this is indicative of a moral crisis and not just a wanting education system. We also learn that suicide rates are the highest in decades; but implicit in this is that these rates were once as high as they are now, which undercuts his argument that today\u2019s rate is evidence of something unique in America\u2019s history.\nThe book is filled with casual cheap shots more befitting a five-minute TV segment than a serious work of history or political philosophy.\nIt is only deep into the book that Shapiro confronts the uncomfortable fact that the men who brought the United States to his putative philosophical high-water mark also circumscribed the rights of blacks and women. He tells us, \u201cthe founding was rife with contradiction,\u201d but then, instead of confronting this idea head on, pointlessly quotes Jefferson, Madison, and Frederick Douglas before closing the chapter.\nThe book is also filled with casual cheap shots more befitting a five-minute TV segment than a serious work of history or political philosophy. He writes at one point, \u201cSounding a lot like Bernie Sanders, Lenin wrote in 1917, \u2018Democracy for an insignificant minority, democracy for the rich\u2014that is the democracy of capitalist society.\u2019 \u201d By linking Sanders\u2014who Shapiro sees as a symptom of our ceaseless deviation from the Founder\u2019s values\u2014to an utterly anodyne quote from Lenin, Shapiro seems to hope the reader will draw a moral equivalency between the Senator and the Chairman.\nThere are hints of an interesting argument scattered throughout The Right Side of History, but they sit in logical isolation. While it\u2019s possible that Shapiro\u2019s more hardcore fans will end up mistaking the book\u2019s shallow philosophical analysis for intellectual profundity, less gullible readers will find its argument crumbling, fragment by half-baked fragment.",

They&rsquo;re clearly not working. Beginning today, with this historic vote, the people of Toledo and our allies are ushering in a new era of environmental rights by securing the rights of the Great Lake Erie.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lakeerieaction.org/\">The amendment</a> recognizes rights to &ldquo;exist, flourish, and naturally evolve&rdquo; for Lake Erie, and rights to a &ldquo;clean and healthy Lake Erie and Lake Erie ecosystem&rdquo; for residents of Toledo. To enforce the rights, local residents are given standing in court to sue corporate polluters on behalf of the lake, and to seek legal damages&mdash;which would go toward a city fund to clean up the lake.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fjulian.mack%2Fvideos%2F10103901726700512%2F&show_text=0&width=267\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s vote came just over two weeks after the the White Earth Band of Ojibwe (part of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe) <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-tribe-asks-can-wild-rice-have-its-own-legal-rights/505618712/\">passed a law</a> recognizing the legal rights of a species of wild rice. They had assistance from the same law firm that worked with local residents in Toledo, the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund.</p>\n<p>The tribal law establishes rights for the rice &ldquo;to pure water and freshwater habitat,&rdquo; a right not to be infected by genetically modified rice, and gives legal standing to the reservation business committee to sue <em>on behalf </em>of the rice species. It also makes it a crime to violate the rice species rights, and prohibits law enforcement from arresting or detaining &ldquo;persons directly enforcing these rights.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Toledo vote could easily have never taken place.</p>\n<p>Toledoans for Safe Water&mdash;formed in response to a drinking water crisis caused by a 2014 algae bloom on the lake&mdash;<a href=\"https://progressive.org/dispatches/not-another-flint-let-us-vote-180925/\">collected</a> more than enough signatures to place the Lake Erie Bill of Rights on the November 2018 ballot. The local Lucas County Board of Elections then called a special meeting and decided to remove the charter amendment from last November&rsquo;s ballot. The Board of Elections&rsquo; attorney said the board could refuse to certify a ballot initiative if it thinks the measure is beyond the &ldquo;constitutional power of the municipality.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It was a story that has played out annually in Ohio.</p>\n<p>Groups with the Ohio Community Rights Network, a statewide group formed largely in response to the fracking and gas pipeline boom in Ohio, have qualified over a dozen similar local initiatives recognizing the rights of local ecosystems. In response, since 2015, local boards of elections, the oil and gas industry, the secretary of state, and the Ohio Supreme Court have provided legal arguments to remove at least eleven of such initiatives from the ballot, despite all of them gathering the required number of signatures.</p>\n<p>The Ohio legislature even passed a law to further empower local boards of elections, like the Lucas County Board of Elections, to stop votes from happening. (Earlier this year, members of the Network together with the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund <a href=\"http://www.medina-gazette.com/News/2019/02/05/Board-of-elections-secretary-of-state-sue-over-ballot-rejections.html\">filed</a> a federal civil rights lawsuit against the systemic repression of the ordinances.)</p>\n<p>The worldwide attention the Toledo law has enjoyed reveals why the power structures with the most to lose are so fearful of these local laws. In Toledo, just before the vote, a group called &ldquo;Toledo Jobs and Growth Coalition,&rdquo; began sponsoring radio ads and other messages opposing the Bill of Rights.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The worldwide attention the Toledo law has enjoyed reveals why the power structures with the most to lose are so fearful of these local laws.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Documents showed the group was linked to <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2018&cmte=C00499343\">Strategic Public Partners Group</a>, whose clients include some of the largest corporations and lobbying groups on the planet: Coca-Cola, FedEx, Ohio Chamber of Commerce, Bank of America, Ford, the National Football League, and PhRMA.</p>\n<p>The local laws face corporate and state backlash and &ldquo;preemption.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Since the network has begun pushing these laws, corporations have argued laws like the Lake Erie Bill of Rights violate <em>their</em> constitutional rights as &ldquo;persons&rdquo; under the law, while the state argues the local communities have no such powers to challenge industrial practices which it permits.</p>\n<p>This forces the local communities, hell bent on protecting basic human necessities and the vitality of the ecosystems upon which they depend, to directly challenge these legal assumptions. As the Lake Erie Bill of Rights <a href=\"https://www.co.lucas.oh.us/DocumentCenter/View/71936/Combined-ballot-language-for-2-26-19-election\">reads</a>:</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Corporations that violate this law, or that seek to violate this law, shall not be deemed to be &lsquo;persons.&rsquo; &rdquo;</em></p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;All laws adopted by the legislature of the State of Ohio, and rules adopted by any State agency, shall be the law of the City of Toledo only to the extent that they do not violate the rights or prohibitions of this law.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>More conventional groups&mdash;environmental nonprofits that devote resources to enforcing existing environmental laws&mdash;have often shrugged off the Rights of Nature movement as pie in the sky. The laws, their logic goes, won&rsquo;t stand up in court.</p>\n<p>But these critiques miss a major point and strategic calculation of the Rights of Nature movement, which does not see these laws as legal silver bullets, but as political tools to drive more structural and cultural change.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What Toledo voters and other places working on rights of nature are hoping is to not only change laws but to change culture,&rdquo; Tish O&rsquo;Dell, Ohio organizer for the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund told me. &ldquo;So much of our way of thinking about our relationship with nature has to change. We are not separate from nature but part of nature. Nature is living and that right to thrive, flourish and be healthy needs to be recognized. Nature doesn&rsquo;t need us to survive but we need nature to survive.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In New Mexico, where a similar Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund-assisted law was passed in Mora County and <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/why-are-fracking-hopefuls-suing-county-new-mexico/\">challenged</a> in federal court by Chevron in 2014, the Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico<a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/rural-america/entry/18976/thomas-linzey-interview-on-corporate-control-and-community-rights\"> warned</a> against this type of local law driving larger systemic change, calling it &ldquo;the beginning of a social movement that is greater than just the oil and gas industry, it is a potential game changer for all of corporate America.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.pubservice.com/subnew1page.aspx?PC=tp&pk=MHOL18\"><img alt=\"Fighting Bob piece of me\" data-src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/13411/download/You%20want%20a%20piece%20of%20me_%20%28gif%29.gif?cb=c9438933ff553df2e5bbcfc1793d8dbf&w={width}&h={height}\" data-widths=\"[864]\" sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/13411/download/You%20want%20a%20piece%20of%20me_%20%28gif%29.gif?cb=c9438933ff553df2e5bbcfc1793d8dbf&w={width}&h={height}\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.pubservice.com/subnew1page.aspx?PC=tp&pk=MHOL18\">Fighting Bob piece of me</a></figcaption></figure>",

                "text": "Vibrant green filaments of a toxic algae bloom extend out from the northern shore of Lake Erie in 2011. Blooms like these and other threats to drinking water, and lack of action by local and state agencies, have compelled area residents to organize.\nLast night, residents of Toledo, Ohio voted in favor of a major breakthrough for the \u201cRights of Nature\u201d movement. Recognizing legally-enforceable rights for the natural world, the Lake Erie Bill of Rights passed with 61.4 percent of the vote.\nSince making it to the February Special Election ballot, the groundbreaking city charter amendment has made national and international news, appearing in The New York Times, CNN, Mother Jones, Bloomberg, as well as The Guardian, Canada\u2019s CBC and the French paper Le Monde. \u201cAn Ohio city will vote on whether Lake Erie has the same rights as a person,\u201d read the CNN headline.\nThough the Rights of Nature movement has enjoyed sporadic media attention for its gains made in New Zealand, Ecuador, Bolivia, India, and elsewhere, never before has Rights of Nature organizing by non-indigenous residents of the United States gained this level of attention.\nNever before has Rights of Nature organizing by non-indigenous residents of the United States gained this level of attention.\nFollowing yesterday\u2019s vote, Markie Miller of Toledoans for Safe Water said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ve been using the same laws for decades to try and protect Lake Erie. They\u2019re clearly not working. Beginning today, with this historic vote, the people of Toledo and our allies are ushering in a new era of environmental rights by securing the rights of the Great Lake Erie.\u201d\nThe amendment recognizes rights to \u201cexist, flourish, and naturally evolve\u201d for Lake Erie, and rights to a \u201cclean and healthy Lake Erie and Lake Erie ecosystem\u201d for residents of Toledo. To enforce the rights, local residents are given standing in court to sue corporate polluters on behalf of the lake, and to seek legal damages\u2014which would go toward a city fund to clean up the lake.\nYesterday\u2019s vote came just over two weeks after the the White Earth Band of Ojibwe (part of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe) passed a law recognizing the legal rights of a species of wild rice. They had assistance from the same law firm that worked with local residents in Toledo, the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund.\nThe tribal law establishes rights for the rice \u201cto pure water and freshwater habitat,\u201d a right not to be infected by genetically modified rice, and gives legal standing to the reservation business committee to sue on behalf of the rice species. It also makes it a crime to violate the rice species rights, and prohibits law enforcement from arresting or detaining \u201cpersons directly enforcing these rights.\u201d\nThe Toledo vote could easily have never taken place.\nToledoans for Safe Water\u2014formed in response to a drinking water crisis caused by a 2014 algae bloom on the lake\u2014collected more than enough signatures to place the Lake Erie Bill of Rights on the November 2018 ballot. The local Lucas County Board of Elections then called a special meeting and decided to remove the charter amendment from last November\u2019s ballot. The Board of Elections\u2019 attorney said the board could refuse to certify a ballot initiative if it thinks the measure is beyond the \u201cconstitutional power of the municipality.\u201d\nIt was a story that has played out annually in Ohio.\nGroups with the Ohio Community Rights Network, a statewide group formed largely in response to the fracking and gas pipeline boom in Ohio, have qualified over a dozen similar local initiatives recognizing the rights of local ecosystems. In response, since 2015, local boards of elections, the oil and gas industry, the secretary of state, and the Ohio Supreme Court have provided legal arguments to remove at least eleven of such initiatives from the ballot, despite all of them gathering the required number of signatures.\nThe Ohio legislature even passed a law to further empower local boards of elections, like the Lucas County Board of Elections, to stop votes from happening. (Earlier this year, members of the Network together with the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the systemic repression of the ordinances.)\nThe worldwide attention the Toledo law has enjoyed reveals why the power structures with the most to lose are so fearful of these local laws. In Toledo, just before the vote, a group called \u201cToledo Jobs and Growth Coalition,\u201d began sponsoring radio ads and other messages opposing the Bill of Rights.\nThe worldwide attention the Toledo law has enjoyed reveals why the power structures with the most to lose are so fearful of these local laws.\nDocuments showed the group was linked to Strategic Public Partners Group, whose clients include some of the largest corporations and lobbying groups on the planet: Coca-Cola, FedEx, Ohio Chamber of Commerce, Bank of America, Ford, the National Football League, and PhRMA.\nThe local laws face corporate and state backlash and \u201cpreemption.\u201d\nSince the network has begun pushing these laws, corporations have argued laws like the Lake Erie Bill of Rights violate their constitutional rights as \u201cpersons\u201d under the law, while the state argues the local communities have no such powers to challenge industrial practices which it permits.\nThis forces the local communities, hell bent on protecting basic human necessities and the vitality of the ecosystems upon which they depend, to directly challenge these legal assumptions. As the Lake Erie Bill of Rights reads:\n\u201cCorporations that violate this law, or that seek to violate this law, shall not be deemed to be \u2018persons.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cAll laws adopted by the legislature of the State of Ohio, and rules adopted by any State agency, shall be the law of the City of Toledo only to the extent that they do not violate the rights or prohibitions of this law.\u201d\nMore conventional groups\u2014environmental nonprofits that devote resources to enforcing existing environmental laws\u2014have often shrugged off the Rights of Nature movement as pie in the sky. The laws, their logic goes, won\u2019t stand up in court.\nBut these critiques miss a major point and strategic calculation of the Rights of Nature movement, which does not see these laws as legal silver bullets, but as political tools to drive more structural and cultural change.\n\u201cWhat Toledo voters and other places working on rights of nature are hoping is to not only change laws but to change culture,\u201d Tish O\u2019Dell, Ohio organizer for the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund told me. \u201cSo much of our way of thinking about our relationship with nature has to change. We are not separate from nature but part of nature. Nature is living and that right to thrive, flourish and be healthy needs to be recognized. Nature doesn\u2019t need us to survive but we need nature to survive.\u201d\nIn New Mexico, where a similar Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund-assisted law was passed in Mora County and challenged in federal court by Chevron in 2014, the Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico warned against this type of local law driving larger systemic change, calling it \u201cthe beginning of a social movement that is greater than just the oil and gas industry, it is a potential game changer for all of corporate America.\u201d",

The Trump Administration&rsquo;s attack on Title X promises to block health care access for some four million people&mdash;mostly poor, mostly women.</p>\n<p>Four million people in 2017 <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/fp-annual-report/fpar-2017/index.html\">benefited</a> from Title X-funded services, ranging from cervical and breast cancer screening to contraception and STD testing. Two-thirds of these people, most of them women, were <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/fp-annual-report/fpar-2017/index.html\">living</a> at or below the poverty line. Last week, when Trump finalized a new rule on February 26 <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2019/02/dangerous-and-coercive-title-x-gag-rule-released\">preventing</a> clinics who receive Title X funds from performing abortions or referring patient to clinics that do, he in essence issued an ultimatum to family planning clinics: Abandon four million people who rely on you for non-abortion services or abandon reproductive rights.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s an ultimatum the administration has issued before, and at a global scale. One of Trump&rsquo;s first acts after taking office was to reinstate the Global Gag Rule, which <a href=\"http://www.genderhealth.org/files/uploads/change/publications/Prescribing_Chaos_in_Global_Health_full_report.pdf\">imposes</a> the same abortion and referral restrictions as the new Title X guidelines on recipients of international family planning assistance. Then, in May 2017, he <a href=\"http://www.genderhealth.org/files/uploads/change/publications/Prescribing_Chaos_in_Global_Health_full_report.pdf\">expanded</a> the rule to apply to <em>all</em> global health assistance, increasing by sixteen times <a href=\"https://www.globalfundforwomen.org/infographic-global-gag-rule/#.XHZSJJMzYW9\">the amount</a> of funding affected.</p>\n<p>Some groups have stood their ground. Marie Stopes International, which works in thirty-seven countries to <a href=\"https://mariestopes.org/about-us/\">provide</a> contraception and safe abortion, has refused to alter its mission, and as a result is now ineligible for U.S. funds. It has <a href=\"https://mariestopes.org/news/2018/1/global-gag-rule-anniversary/\">estimated</a> that the Global Gag Rule left them with a funding gap of nearly $80 million in 2018, a deficit the organization predicts will result in as many as 2.5 million unintended pregnancies, 870,000 unsafe abortions, and 7,000 avoidable maternal deaths.</p>\n<p>The outcome is no better when organizations abide by the Global Gag Rule, reducing access to safe abortions. The World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/abortion-safety-estimates/en/\">reports</a> that in countries that completely ban abortion or only allow it in cases where the mother&rsquo;s life of health is threatened, only one in four abortions is safe. And, the overall number of abortions doesn&rsquo;t drop when tighter restrictions are put in place.</p>\n<p>Similar patterns are evident in the United States. A 2017 Center for Reproductive Rights study <a href=\"https://www.reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/USPA-Ibis-Evaluating-Priorities-v2.pdf\">found</a> the more abortion restrictions a state imposes, the worse its indicators of women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s health. Women who don&rsquo;t have access to abortion care are also more likely to experience poverty, physical health impairments, and intimate partner violence, according to the report.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Title X funding provides the most vulnerable people in the United States with health care.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Title X funding provides the most vulnerable people in the United States with health care. In 2017, most of the patients <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/fp-annual-report/fpar-2017/index.html\">seen</a> at Title X-funded clinics (community health centers and Planned Parenthood or other family planning clinics) were young women with low incomes. A full 90 percent of patients&mdash;3.6 million&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/fp-annual-report/fpar-2017/index.html\">qualified</a> for subsidized or no-cost services. A third of U.S. women with low incomes <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/womens-sexual-and-reproductive-health-services-key-findings-from-the-2017-kaiser-womens-health-survey/\">depend on</a> Title X clinics for their contraception.</p>\n<p>Five states&mdash;California, Connecticut, New York, Oregon and Washington&mdash;have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/431202-ny-ca-and-washington-threaten-to-sue-over-trump-rule-to-restrict\">vowed</a> to sue to block implementation of the rule. Seven others have <a href=\"https://www.istandwithpp.org/no-gag-rule/list-opposition-gag-rule\">expressed</a> opposition, as have the American Medical Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, Association of American Medical Colleges and many other health, legal, and advocacy groups. The ACLU and Center for Reproductive Rights have <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/reproductive-rights-groups-ready-to-sue-trump-over-abortion-rule\">announced</a> their intention to sue.</p>\n<p>The American Medical Association issued a statement <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-statements/ama-statement-title-x-gag-rule-and-funding-restrictions\">warning</a> about the new rule&rsquo;s consequences: &ldquo;Millions of women depend on the Title X program for access to much-needed healthcare including cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and treatment, and other exams. This is the wrong prescription and threatens to compound a health equity deficit in this nation.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote><p>The ACLU and Center for Reproductive Rights have announced their intention to sue, but while legal challenges work their way through the system, millions who can&rsquo;t afford non-subsidized health care are left without recourse.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Anti-choice advocates <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/06/18/title_x_rule_will_hurt_planned_parenthood_but_help_women_137299.html\">claim</a> the Trump Administration&rsquo;s actions will help get women out of &ldquo;dismal abortion clinics&rdquo; and into &ldquo;bustling, cheerful community health centers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But it will not be easy for non-Planned Parenthood centers to fill the gap. A Guttmacher Institute study <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/guttmacher-cbo-memo-2015.pdf\">reveals</a> that in 103 counties, Planned Parenthood is the only facility supplying publicly funded contraceptives. And these clinics serve far more contraceptive clients each year on average than other types of health facilities&mdash;2,950 as opposed to the 330 served by federally qualified health centers and the 750 served by health departments.</p>\n<p>The final say will lie with the courts, but it will take time for legal challenges to work their way through the system&mdash;time in which millions who can&rsquo;t afford non-subsidized health care are left without recourse. Eventually, the decision may fall to a U.S. Supreme Court that has <a href=\"https://progressive.org/dispatches/Supreme-Court-roe-is-still-not-safe-181213/\">shifted</a> further right under Trump. And that could mean the responsibility for ensuring adequate health care access for vulnerable populations&mdash;like other protections of reproductive rights&mdash;will eventually fall to the states.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.pubservice.com/subnew1page.aspx?PC=tp&pk=MHOL18\"><img alt=\"Fighting Bob piece of me\" data-src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/13411/download/You%20want%20a%20piece%20of%20me_%20%28gif%29.gif?cb=c9438933ff553df2e5bbcfc1793d8dbf&w={width}&h={height}\" data-widths=\"[864]\" sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/13411/download/You%20want%20a%20piece%20of%20me_%20%28gif%29.gif?cb=c9438933ff553df2e5bbcfc1793d8dbf&w={width}&h={height}\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></a><figcaption>Comments</figcaption></figure>",

In 2017, most of the patients seen at Title X-funded clinics (community health centers and Planned Parenthood or other family planning clinics) were young women with low incomes. A full 90 percent of patients\u20143.6 million\u2014qualified for subsidized or no-cost services. A third of U.S. women with low incomes depend on Title X clinics for their contraception.\nFive states\u2014California, Connecticut, New York, Oregon and Washington\u2014have vowed to sue to block implementation of the rule. Seven others have expressed opposition, as have the American Medical Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, Association of American Medical Colleges and many other health, legal, and advocacy groups. The ACLU and Center for Reproductive Rights have announced their intention to sue.\nThe American Medical Association issued a statement warning about the new rule\u2019s consequences: \u201cMillions of women depend on the Title X program for access to much-needed healthcare including cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and treatment, and other exams. This is the wrong prescription and threatens to compound a health equity deficit in this nation.\u201d\nThe ACLU and Center for Reproductive Rights have announced their intention to sue, but while legal challenges work their way through the system, millions who can\u2019t afford non-subsidized health care are left without recourse.\nAnti-choice advocates claim the Trump Administration\u2019s actions will help get women out of \u201cdismal abortion clinics\u201d and into \u201cbustling, cheerful community health centers.\u201d\nBut it will not be easy for non-Planned Parenthood centers to fill the gap. A Guttmacher Institute study reveals that in 103 counties, Planned Parenthood is the only facility supplying publicly funded contraceptives. And these clinics serve far more contraceptive clients each year on average than other types of health facilities\u20142,950 as opposed to the 330 served by federally qualified health centers and the 750 served by health departments.\nThe final say will lie with the courts, but it will take time for legal challenges to work their way through the system\u2014time in which millions who can\u2019t afford non-subsidized health care are left without recourse. Eventually, the decision may fall to a U.S. Supreme Court that has shifted further right under Trump. And that could mean the responsibility for ensuring adequate health care access for vulnerable populations\u2014like other protections of reproductive rights\u2014will eventually fall to the states.",

But Donald Trump came here, and stirred up white, working-class voter antagonism, including with a <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2016/03/29/trump-wisconsin-rally/#969vdnigoEq1\">rally</a> in Janesville, a former manufacturing hub that lost its GM plant. There, Trump promised to represent &ldquo;the forgotten women and men of America,&rdquo; and mocked city&rsquo;s Republican Representative in Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan, as well as Republican Governor Scott Walker, implying both men were phonies.</p>\n<p>One lesson for Democrats from 2016 is that they can&rsquo;t leave white, working-class voters to Trump. In choosing Milwaukee, a blue-collar Midwestern hub, the Democrats are sending the message that they are not just the party of East Coast and West Coast elites.</p>\n<p>Bernie Sanders, arguably the Democratic frontrunner so far this year, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/primaries/wisconsin\">beat</a> Hillary Clinton in the Wisconsin primary by 56.6 percent to 43.1 percent.</p>\n<p>Sanders, a Democratic Socialist, will feel right at home in Milwaukee, a working-class city that elected <a href=\"http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/articles/socialism-and-milwaukees-amnesia/\">three socialist mayors</a> when it was at the center of the early-twentieth-century Sewer Socialist movement, which pushed for increased wages and worker protections and public ownership of utilities.</p>\n<p>But Milwaukee has also been rated the <a href=\"https://www.wuwm.com/post/wisconsin-worst-nation-well-being-black-children#stream/0\">worst place in America</a> to raise an African American child. The city, home to two-thirds of Wisconsin&rsquo;s African American residents, is the <a href=\"https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-is-americas-most-segregated-city-report-says/25765812\">most segregated</a> in America.</p>\n<p>Milwaukee County, alone among Wisconsin counties, went for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/primaries/wisconsin\">2016 primary</a>, highlighting Bernie&rsquo;s gap with African American voters all over the country.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is the first Midwestern city to host a Democratic convention since Chicago in 1996. </p> </blockquote>\n<p>Milwaukee is Ground Zero for Republican voter-suppression efforts, which arguably changed the outcome of the 2016 election. Had the Republican legislature in Wisconsin not passed voter ID, Wisconsin would have had 200,000 more voters in 2016, Ari Berman<a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/voter-suppression-wisconsin-election-2016/\"> argues</a> in a <em>Mother Jones </em>article titled, &ldquo;Rigged: How Voter Suppression Threw Wisconsin to Trump (And Possibly Handed Him the Whole Election).&rdquo; Those missing voters skewed more African American and more Democratic than the general voting population. That&rsquo;s a big deal, because Trump only won the election by only 78,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Berman points out.</p>\n<p>Milwaukee&mdash;with its working-class, socialist history, its legacy of <a href=\"https://projects.jsonline.com/topics/50-year-ache/\">civil-rights struggle</a>, and its white working class that has swung back and forth between political parties&mdash;is a fascinating location for the 2020 Democratic convention.</p>\n<p>It is the first Midwestern city to host a Democratic convention since Chicago in 1996.</p>\n<p>By choosing Milwaukee as the site of their 2020 national convention, the Democratic Party is trying to right a historic mistake. Not only did Hillary Clinton skip Wisconsin in 2016, the whole national Democratic Party chose to stay out of a crucial battle for the soul of the country when Republican Governor Scott Walker<a href=\"https://progressive.org/dispatches/inaugration-day-for-evers-conniff-190108/\"> rolled out </a>his &ldquo;divide and conquer&rdquo; strategy, attacking teachers and other public employee unions and bringing hundreds of thousands of citizens into the streets in historic protests. Citizens gathered a million signatures for a recall effort against Walker that President Obama somehow couldn&rsquo;t find the time to support.</p>\n<p>In the state that was the birthplace of the Progressive Movement, as championed by Fighting Bob La Follette, which pioneered workers comp, a progressive state income tax, and stringent child-labor laws, Walker turned non-union working-class people against their unionized neighbors, and stoked a bitterly divisive politics that set the stage for Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>One of the bright spots of the 2018 midterm elections was Walker&rsquo;s defeat by Tony Evers, the gentle, upbeat former state superintendent of public instruction. Evers sidestepped the Republican culture wars and ran on solving problems Walker created, including fixing roads full of potholes, restoring school funding, and cleaning up a toxic political atmosphere in a once-civilized, progressive state.</p>\n<p>Evers won in a nail biter, with help from his charismatic young running-mate, Mandela Barnes, the first African American lieutenant governor and only the second black candidate elected to statewide office in Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>Barnes, who is from Milwaukee has been a target of relentless racist <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/09/17/lt-gov-rebecca-kleefisch-without-evidence-claims-opponent-knelt-during-national-anthem/1337241002/\">attacks</a> by the rightwingers who continue to control the state legislature.</p>\n<p>Despite voter suppression, one of the most <a href=\"https://progressive.org/dispatches/redrawing-the-political-map-181227/\">gerrymandered legislative maps</a> in the country, and an outrageous eleventh-hour<a href=\"https://progressive.org/dispatches/public-uproar-over-wisconsin-republican-power-grab-181204/\"> power grab</a> by the Republican legislative majority that sought to disempower the new Democratic administration before it even took office, Wisconsin&rsquo;s 2018 election raised hopes that Democrats could overcome the divisiveness of the Walker/Trump era with a unifying, public-spirited message.</p>\n<p>That hope will be put to the test next year in Milwaukee, in the heart of America&rsquo;s divided political landscape.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.pubservice.com/subnew1page.aspx?PC=tp&pk=MHOL18\"><img alt=\"Fighting Bob piece of me\" data-src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/13411/download/You%20want%20a%20piece%20of%20me_%20%28gif%29.gif?cb=c9438933ff553df2e5bbcfc1793d8dbf&w={width}&h={height}\" data-widths=\"[864]\" sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/13411/download/You%20want%20a%20piece%20of%20me_%20%28gif%29.gif?cb=c9438933ff553df2e5bbcfc1793d8dbf&w={width}&h={height}\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.pubservice.com/subnew1page.aspx?PC=tp&pk=MHOL18\">Fighting Bob piece of me</a></figcaption></figure>",

But Donald Trump came here, and stirred up white, working-class voter antagonism, including with a rally in Janesville, a former manufacturing hub that lost its GM plant. There, Trump promised to represent \u201cthe forgotten women and men of America,\u201d and mocked city\u2019s Republican Representative in Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan, as well as Republican Governor Scott Walker, implying both men were phonies.\nOne lesson for Democrats from 2016 is that they can\u2019t leave white, working-class voters to Trump. In choosing Milwaukee, a blue-collar Midwestern hub, the Democrats are sending the message that they are not just the party of East Coast and West Coast elites.\nBernie Sanders, arguably the Democratic frontrunner so far this year, beat Hillary Clinton in the Wisconsin primary by 56.6 percent to 43.1 percent.\nSanders, a Democratic Socialist, will feel right at home in Milwaukee, a working-class city that elected three socialist mayors when it was at the center of the early-twentieth-century Sewer Socialist movement, which pushed for increased wages and worker protections and public ownership of utilities.\nBut Milwaukee has also been rated the worst place in America to raise an African American child. The city, home to two-thirds of Wisconsin\u2019s African American residents, is the most segregated in America.\nMilwaukee County, alone among Wisconsin counties, went for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary, highlighting Bernie\u2019s gap with African American voters all over the country.\nIt is the first Midwestern city to host a Democratic convention since Chicago in 1996.\nMilwaukee is Ground Zero for Republican voter-suppression efforts, which arguably changed the outcome of the 2016 election. Had the Republican legislature in Wisconsin not passed voter ID, Wisconsin would have had 200,000 more voters in 2016, Ari Berman argues in a Mother Jones article titled, \u201cRigged: How Voter Suppression Threw Wisconsin to Trump (And Possibly Handed Him the Whole Election).\u201d Those missing voters skewed more African American and more Democratic than the general voting population. That\u2019s a big deal, because Trump only won the election by only 78,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Berman points out.\nMilwaukee\u2014with its working-class, socialist history, its legacy of civil-rights struggle, and its white working class that has swung back and forth between political parties\u2014is a fascinating location for the 2020 Democratic convention.\nIt is the first Midwestern city to host a Democratic convention since Chicago in 1996.\nBy choosing Milwaukee as the site of their 2020 national convention, the Democratic Party is trying to right a historic mistake. Not only did Hillary Clinton skip Wisconsin in 2016, the whole national Democratic Party chose to stay out of a crucial battle for the soul of the country when Republican Governor Scott Walker rolled out his \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d strategy, attacking teachers and other public employee unions and bringing hundreds of thousands of citizens into the streets in historic protests. Citizens gathered a million signatures for a recall effort against Walker that President Obama somehow couldn\u2019t find the time to support.\nIn the state that was the birthplace of the Progressive Movement, as championed by Fighting Bob La Follette, which pioneered workers comp, a progressive state income tax, and stringent child-labor laws, Walker turned non-union working-class people against their unionized neighbors, and stoked a bitterly divisive politics that set the stage for Donald Trump.\nOne of the bright spots of the 2018 midterm elections was Walker\u2019s defeat by Tony Evers, the gentle, upbeat former state superintendent of public instruction. Evers sidestepped the Republican culture wars and ran on solving problems Walker created, including fixing roads full of potholes, restoring school funding, and cleaning up a toxic political atmosphere in a once-civilized, progressive state.\nEvers won in a nail biter, with help from his charismatic young running-mate, Mandela Barnes, the first African American lieutenant governor and only the second black candidate elected to statewide office in Wisconsin.\nBarnes, who is from Milwaukee has been a target of relentless racist attacks by the rightwingers who continue to control the state legislature.\nDespite voter suppression, one of the most gerrymandered legislative maps in the country, and an outrageous eleventh-hour power grab by the Republican legislative majority that sought to disempower the new Democratic administration before it even took office, Wisconsin\u2019s 2018 election raised hopes that Democrats could overcome the divisiveness of the Walker/Trump era with a unifying, public-spirited message.\nThat hope will be put to the test next year in Milwaukee, in the heart of America\u2019s divided political landscape.",

It was so long ago I do not remember their faces. But I remember the sound of their labored breathing, which is to say I remember the sound of death.</p>\n<p>This is how you die of black lung.</p>\n<p>You are born by chance into a world where a mineral is more valuable than your body. From a young age, you learn to equate work with danger but also brotherhood. You will outlive friends among these dangers&mdash;faulty electrical writing, flooding, roof collapse&mdash;only to return one day from the doctor knowing the mountain you pulverized for coal is now part of you, embedded in your lungs. You thought coal was <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=zaqwAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\">in your blood</a>, but now it&rsquo;s in your chest.</p>\n<blockquote><p>More coal miners are dying from black lung than ever before, and many are dying younger.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>The disease you have is fatal. Your body, in trying to heal the unhealable, has wrapped the coal dust and silica in your lungs in tissue that will become fibrosis. You will feel like an elephant is sitting on your chest; every organ will work harder to compensate for your body&rsquo;s lack of oxygen as you slowly suffocate.</p>\n<p>There is only one treatment that might significantly prolong your life: a <a href=\"http://www.milliman.com/uploadedFiles/insight/2017/2017-Transplant-Report.pdf\">$1.2 million</a> lung transplant. You might feel guilty that your family must bear the cost of your illness and suffer with you. You would have preferred, if your life had to be cut short by work, to die quickly in an accident. You will think of the mines and you will think of your friends and you will say &ldquo;We killed ourselves&rdquo; over and over, long before you are dead.</p>\n<p>More coal miners are dying from black lung than ever before, and many are dying younger. I&rsquo;ve read this fact many times over the past two years, in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/18/675253856/an-epidemic-is-killing-thousands-of-coal-miners-regulators-could-have-stopped-it?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=2048\">news stories</a> that also generate now-predictable <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NPR/status/1075119005914910721?s=20\">Twitter comments</a>. &ldquo;I refuse to cry over folks who created their own problems,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IjPinion/status/1075139251027755008\">reads</a> one. &ldquo;Miners are a big reason why we have Trump . . . . Too bad they didn&rsquo;t all pass away sooner and we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this mess,&rdquo; reads <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elizabethcatte/status/1088582332850802688\">another</a>.</p>\n<p>Trump campaigned heavily on promises to revive the country&rsquo;s dying coal industry, and Appalachia&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/coal/annual/pdf/table18.pdf\">roughly 30,000</a> miners bore the brunt of the reaction. By mid-December 2016, with Trump&rsquo;s Inauguration looming, the progressive-aligned political website Daily Kos was <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/12/12/1610198/-Be-happy-for-coal-miners-losing-their-health-insurance-They-re-getting-exactly-what-they-voted-for\">telling its readers</a> to &ldquo;be happy&rdquo; that coal miners&rsquo; federally backed health care and pensions would soon be on the chopping block.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The black lung epidemic represents a dilemma that progressives must confront in order to find the heart and soul of the values that will take them into 2020.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising, then, that news of a black lung epidemic in Appalachia has failed to capture the public&rsquo;s sympathies. With a country awash in crises, why should progressives champion a group of sick workers attached to a dying industry who linked their own fortunes to Trump&rsquo;s impossible plans?</p>\n<p>But the black lung epidemic represents a dilemma that progressives must confront in order to find the heart and soul of the values that will take them into 2020. Workers are dying because politicians on both sides of the aisle were willing to rank their lives below the promise of industry. People are suffering because they cannot afford medical care. Will we be the country that maintains this system of acceptable casualties, or will we build something better?</p>\n<p>In 2016, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6549a1.htm\">confirmed</a> a resurgence of black lung, a preventable occupational disease, in central Appalachia. Brandon Crum, a radiologist based in the coalfields of eastern Kentucky, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/13/dr-dust-the-man-who-discovered-a-hidden-black-lung-epidemic\">contacted</a> NIOSH in June of that year to report an alarming increase in the number of advanced black lung cases at his practice.</p>\n<p>NIOSH monitors the health of working miners through a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/cwhsp/default.html\">voluntary program</a> which, from 2011 to 2016, reported only ninety-nine cases of advanced black lung. But between January 2015 and December 2016 alone, Crum&rsquo;s clinic had identified sixty cases. Equally troubling, the disease appeared to be presenting in younger miners.</p>\n<p>While NIOSH worked to confirm the data from Crum&rsquo;s Kentucky clinic, NPR reporter Howard Berkes <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/12/15/505577680/advanced-black-lung-cases-surge-in-appalachia\">launched</a> an independent investigation in <a href=\"https://www.appalshop.org/news/award-winning-black-lung-reports/\">collaboration</a> with regional media partners to gather data from eleven additional black lung clinics. By December 2016, NIOSH was <a href=\"https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/special_reports/most-deadly-black-lung-resurgence-worse-than-thought-reports-say/article_fbc9a29d-e26c-5a88-8ce9-fc2453dedd9d.html\">reporting</a> evidence of a black lung resurgence that was &ldquo;unprecedented by any historical standard,&rdquo; echoing the results from NPR&rsquo;s investigation, which found 962 cases of advanced black lung across the region in the previous ten years.</p>\n<p>Why were cases of black lung rising exponentially at a time when U.S. coal consumption was in decline, and why had NIOSH been underreporting cases of black lung? We now have some idea, due to the persistence of diligent reporters and whistle-blowing physicians like Crum.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Why were cases of black lung rising exponentially at a time when U.S. coal consumption was in decline, and why had NIOSH been underreporting cases of black lung?</p> </blockquote>\n<p>The term &ldquo;coal mining&rdquo; conjures up images of subterranean tunnels, but modern mining in Appalachia has moved closer to the surface over the last three decades to allow coal operators to access rockier, thinner seams of coal. These seams have a mineral composition that is heavy in silica. Silica is more dangerous than coal dust, but the government&rsquo;s Mine Safety and Health Administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/18/675253856/an-epidemic-is-killing-thousands-of-coal-miners-regulators-could-have-stopped-it\">links</a> most of its safety protocols to coal dust testing alone and does not require air sampling for toxic dust if coal is not present.</p>\n<p>Berkes, the reporter, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/18/675253856/an-epidemic-is-killing-thousands-of-coal-miners-regulators-could-have-stopped-it\">confirmed</a> that the agency has been aware of the dangers posed by these and other loopholes since the late 1980s, but had failed to adopt new rules until the Obama Administration, in part due to pressure from the mining industry and its political allies.</p>\n<p>NIOSH offers black lung screening, but the federal program is voluntary and underused. NIOSH tells miners that it keeps their health data confidential, but with the industry <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/23/trump-says-the-coal-industry-is-back-the-data-say-otherwise.html\">shrinking</a> every year, miners have been <a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/discrimination-fears-may-depress-use-of-black-lung-screenings\">reluctant </a>to use the program for fear that this might make them targets for early termination. NIOSH does not screen retired or laid-off miners.</p>\n<p>When retired or laid-off miners do initiate health screenings, it is often to assess their eligibility for state and federal disability benefits, and clinics like Crum&rsquo;s, which are <a href=\"https://www.wymt.com/content/news/Black-lung-clinics-help-coal-miners-get-benefits-500634051.html\">located throughout Appalachia</a>, assist miners with this process. The presence of significant black lung clusters, then, is a combination of the consequences of known safety loopholes and wave after wave of job losses that have led to more frequent contact between former miners and health professionals.</p>\n<p>That is the nuanced and concise explanation for the current resurgence, but the blunt answer is important, too: Miners are dying because it has always been acceptable to kill them.</p>\n<p>In January 2019, NPR and PBS <em>Frontline</em> capped off a two-year investigation into the new black lung epidemic with the documentary <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/coals-deadly-dust/\"><em>Coal&rsquo;s Deadly Dust</em></a>. The documentary humanized miners, detaching them from the highly politicized lens of Trump&rsquo;s coal industry pandering. Producers captured a moving record of the distressing health challenges miners face, interspersed with interviews between Howard Berkes and mine safety officials who served in administrations dating back to Clinton.</p>\n<p>The documentary also happened to air just weeks before the fiftieth anniversary of an event not well remembered outside of Appalachia: 1969&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.theclio.com/web/entry?id=22876\">black lung strikes</a>. During this pivotal moment in West Virginia&rsquo;s history, progressive politicians, a sympathetic public, and, most importantly, dissenting workers willing to pressure the industry from within created conditions favorable to the passage of our modern mine health and safety laws.</p>\n<p>Exploring past struggles to secure worker protections should be an occasion to reflect on the nation&rsquo;s progress. But the need for reform today might actually be greater than it was fifty years ago. The current U.S. President is bent on deregulating the coal industry, even though this has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-21/trump-promised-to-bring-back-coal-it-s-declining-again\">failed</a> to spur coal recovery, and much of the public is hostile to miners for their perceived alliance with Trump. On their own, miners lack the kind of critical mass necessary to bring industry to their will.</p>\n<p>And yet, understanding broken promises requires learning the terms under which they were forged.</p>\n<p>In 1968, an <a href=\"https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/it-changes-your-entire-life-years-after-farmington-mine-disaster/article_010b3627-7f5d-5261-a9cf-303d30d31b69.html\">explosion</a> at a mine in Farmington, West Virginia, killed seventy-eight miners. The accident occurred at a time when the gulf between union leaders and workers was wider than it had ever been.</p>\n<p>Tony Boyle, the unpopular president of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), who would later be <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-06-01-8502040215-story.html\">convicted</a> of the murder of his challenger, Joseph Yablonski, downplayed the explosion.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I share the grief. I&rsquo;ve lost relatives in a mine explosion,&rdquo; he <a href=\"https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/special_reports/mining-for-truth-safety-laws-written-in-blood/article_cb379508-8a4f-56c8-b98d-9020118c50a2.html\">said</a> after Farmington. &ldquo;But as long as we mine coal, there is always this inherent danger of explosion.&rdquo; Boyle&rsquo;s apparent indifference to the deaths of miners caused <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/11/23/670147046/how-a-1968-disaster-in-a-coal-mine-changed-the-industry\">widespread dissent</a> among the rank-and-file, including the widows and children of dead workers.</p>\n<p>The Farmington disaster received substantial media coverage. Just months earlier, a <a href=\"http://www.wvpublic.org/post/may-6-1968-incident-hominy-falls-traps-25-miners-days#stream/0\">mine flooding</a> in Hominy Falls, West Virginia, had required a five-day rescue operation. Hoping for a similar dramatic outcome, the national press <a href=\"http://www.wvpublic.org/post/farmington-no-9-west-virginia-disaster-changed-coal-mining-forever#stream/0\">dispatched</a> reporters to Farmington. Miners and community members, including local physicians, seized the opportunity to air their grievances about inadequate mine safety and the apathy of the union on a national stage.</p>\n<p>This level of scrutiny and the resulting outcry helped prompt federal and state hearings about the disaster and the broader issues of mine safety. For West Virginia miners, it was of utmost importance that any discussion of reform include laws mandating compensation for sick and injured miners, particularly those with black lung.</p>\n<p>In January 1969, a contingent of West Virginia miners formed the first chapter of the <a href=\"https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/515\">Black Lung Association (BLA)</a> to mobilize support for new compensation laws. By the end of the month, thousands of miners were attending BLA meetings, and the organization could count a number of progressive physicians and lawmakers among its supporters.</p>\n<p>When the BLA called upon the union for support, Boyle refused and threatened to expel participating members. In February 1969, several hundred miners in Raleigh County, West Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.wvpublic.org/post/february-18-1969-against-umwa-wishes-raleigh-co-miners-protest-have-black-lung-recognized#stream/0\">went on strike</a> to protest a management decision. Their walkout quickly spread as miners statewide seized the opportunity to escalate the strike as a means to pressure coal operators, their union, and lawmakers to support mine safety and compensation reform.</p>\n<p>By the end of February, more than 40,000 miners in West Virginia were <a href=\"https://monthlyreview.org/2007/03/01/rank-and-file-rebellions-in-the-coalfields-1964-80/\">engaged</a> in a &ldquo;no law, no coal&rdquo; strike. Strike assistance from disabled miners, widows, and children was organized by the West Virginia-based dissident group <a href=\"https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1816\">Miners for Democracy</a>.</p>\n<p>The strike was long, but ultimately successful. West Virginia passed a compensation bill in early March, and in December 1969 President Nixon signed the <a href=\"https://www.msha.gov/45-years-federal-coal-mine-health-and-safety-act\">Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act</a> into law. The act set stricter limits on acceptable levels of coal dust and established a federally backed compensation program for sick and injured miners. Congress strengthened provisions relating to black lung in 1972 in a separate act of law, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1912/text?format=txt\">Black Lung Benefits Act</a>.</p>\n<p>During the last fifty years, the Mine Safety and Health Administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/13/dr-dust-the-man-who-discovered-a-hidden-black-lung-epidemic\">estimates</a> that 76,000 miners have died from black lung. The hard-won 1969 and 1972 laws were meant to provide clarity about the coal industry&rsquo;s financial obligations to disabled miners and prevent the coal industry from passing on its obligations to taxpayers.</p>\n<p>But successive administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have allowed the coal industry more and more leeway to do exactly that. The federal government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/13/dr-dust-the-man-who-discovered-a-hidden-black-lung-epidemic\">paid out</a> $45 billion in black lung compensation since 1968, and the fund that pays claims on behalf of the coal industry is <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/692103.pdf\">currently $4.3 billion</a> in debt.</p>\n<p>In order to fund black lung benefits, Congress established the <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45261.pdf\">Black Lung Disability Benefit Trust </a>and created a provision to fund it through an excise tax charged to the coal industry. Disabled miners or the dependents of deceased miners, currently about <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/692103.pdf\">25,000 claimants</a>, draw from the fund for <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45261.pdf\">payments</a> that range from $660.10 a month for a single person to $1,320.10 for a family. And although they&rsquo;re given little assistance, those claimants are fortunate.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-15 at 11.57.25 AM.png\" data-src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/12290/download/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-15%20at%2011.57.25%20AM.png?cb=5e0ff5f1019ad4cacd876ce9e9acb52d&w={width}&h={height}\" data-widths=\"[100, 150, 220, 320, 450, 660, 983]\" sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/12290/download/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-15%20at%2011.57.25%20AM.png?cb=5e0ff5f1019ad4cacd876ce9e9acb52d&w={width}&h={height}\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img><figcaption>A West Virginia miner undergoing lung-capacity testing at a clinic in Chicago.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The process of attaining benefits remains filled with bureaucratic hurdles and allows employers to challenge claims. Environmental reporter David Hasemyer <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07092017/coal-company-fights-black-lung-medical-benefits-appalachian-miner\">found</a> that coal industry employers resist 70 percent of benefit claims, meaning that between adversarial challenges and strict disability criteria, fewer than one in ten applications for black lung benefits are approved.</p>\n<p>A resurgence in black lung is unlikely to marshal resources to improve the benefits process for claimants. On a federal level, Congress <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/28/597576628/congress-boosts-black-lung-treatment-funding-by-millions\">authorized </a>additional funding in 2018 to study the epidemic, but Kentucky recently <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/31/598484688/kentucky-lawmakers-limit-black-lung-claims-reviews-despite-epidemic\">passed a law</a> intended to make it more difficult to file a claim.</p>\n<p>As a result, radiologists in Kentucky are no longer allowed to diagnose black lung for the purposes of a benefit claim, meaning that physicians like Crum, who brought the epidemic to the attention of NIOSH, must defer to certified pulmonologists. As of last year, there were <a href=\"https://www.wfae.org/post/ky-lawmakers-didnt-consult-federal-experts-about-limiting-black-lung-claims-reviews#stream/0\">only six physicians</a> in the state that can diagnose black lung and at least four of those have a history of helping the coal industry with claim appeals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are only six physicians in the state that can diagnose black lung and at least four of those have a history of helping the coal industry with claim appeals.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, those approved for benefits must endure the yearly ritual each December to see if Congress will reauthorize the tax provision that funds their benefits. In 2018, with a Republican majority, Congress <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/coal-congress-black-lung-fund.html\">let the provision die</a>. The government can still collect taxes for sick miners, but the coal industry is now paying taxes set at a rate that dates from when the trust was created in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the Trump Administration provided another gift to the coal industry executives when it appointed David Zatezalo, a former coal executive, to lead the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Zatezalo was twice <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-confirms-trump-s-controversial-pick-lead-mine-safety-n821081\">cited</a> by the agency for serious safety violations. In short order, he <a href=\"https://www.tribdem.com/news/rules-protecting-coal-miners-dust-exposure-up-for-review/article_eedcf02c-e25a-11e7-918c-cbe56ce2ee32.html\">announced</a> plans to review new dust standards, a move that likely signals the agency intends to reverse the stricter Obama-era rules regarding acceptable dust limits at mining sites.</p>\n<p>When these rules went into effect in 2014, four years after they were proposed and arguably forty years after they were needed, Obama&rsquo;s Secretary of Labor Tom Perez <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/msha/msha20140669\">declared</a>, &ldquo;Today we advance a very basic principle: You shouldn&rsquo;t have to sacrifice your life for your livelihood.&rdquo; I prefer the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8TM7AMvhNs\">Ken Hechler</a> version of this sentiment.

                "text": "Coal miner Scott Tiller walks through the morning fog before going underground in a mine less than forty inches high in Welch, West Virginia.\nMy first encounter with black lung, the miners\u2019 disease, came when I was a small child visiting relatives in the coalfields of southwestern Virginia. It was so long ago I do not remember their faces. But I remember the sound of their labored breathing, which is to say I remember the sound of death.\nThis is how you die of black lung.\nYou are born by chance into a world where a mineral is more valuable than your body. From a young age, you learn to equate work with danger but also brotherhood. You will outlive friends among these dangers\u2014faulty electrical writing, flooding, roof collapse\u2014only to return one day from the doctor knowing the mountain you pulverized for coal is now part of you, embedded in your lungs. You thought coal was in your blood, but now it\u2019s in your chest.\nMore coal miners are dying from black lung than ever before, and many are dying younger.\nThe disease you have is fatal. Your body, in trying to heal the unhealable, has wrapped the coal dust and silica in your lungs in tissue that will become fibrosis. You will feel like an elephant is sitting on your chest; every organ will work harder to compensate for your body\u2019s lack of oxygen as you slowly suffocate.\nThere is only one treatment that might significantly prolong your life: a $1.2 million lung transplant. You might feel guilty that your family must bear the cost of your illness and suffer with you. You would have preferred, if your life had to be cut short by work, to die quickly in an accident. You will think of the mines and you will think of your friends and you will say \u201cWe killed ourselves\u201d over and over, long before you are dead.\nMore coal miners are dying from black lung than ever before, and many are dying younger. I\u2019ve read this fact many times over the past two years, in news stories that also generate now-predictable Twitter comments. \u201cI refuse to cry over folks who created their own problems,\u201d reads one. \u201cMiners are a big reason why we have Trump . . . . Too bad they didn\u2019t all pass away sooner and we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess,\u201d reads another.\nTrump campaigned heavily on promises to revive the country\u2019s dying coal industry, and Appalachia\u2019s roughly 30,000 miners bore the brunt of the reaction. By mid-December 2016, with Trump\u2019s Inauguration looming, the progressive-aligned political website Daily Kos was telling its readers to \u201cbe happy\u201d that coal miners\u2019 federally backed health care and pensions would soon be on the chopping block.\nThe black lung epidemic represents a dilemma that progressives must confront in order to find the heart and soul of the values that will take them into 2020.\nIt\u2019s not surprising, then, that news of a black lung epidemic in Appalachia has failed to capture the public\u2019s sympathies. With a country awash in crises, why should progressives champion a group of sick workers attached to a dying industry who linked their own fortunes to Trump\u2019s impossible plans?\nBut the black lung epidemic represents a dilemma that progressives must confront in order to find the heart and soul of the values that will take them into 2020. Workers are dying because politicians on both sides of the aisle were willing to rank their lives below the promise of industry. People are suffering because they cannot afford medical care. Will we be the country that maintains this system of acceptable casualties, or will we build something better?\nIn 2016, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) confirmed a resurgence of black lung, a preventable occupational disease, in central Appalachia. Brandon Crum, a radiologist based in the coalfields of eastern Kentucky, had contacted NIOSH in June of that year to report an alarming increase in the number of advanced black lung cases at his practice.\nNIOSH monitors the health of working miners through a voluntary program which, from 2011 to 2016, reported only ninety-nine cases of advanced black lung. But between January 2015 and December 2016 alone, Crum\u2019s clinic had identified sixty cases. Equally troubling, the disease appeared to be presenting in younger miners.\nWhile NIOSH worked to confirm the data from Crum\u2019s Kentucky clinic, NPR reporter Howard Berkes launched an independent investigation in collaboration with regional media partners to gather data from eleven additional black lung clinics. By December 2016, NIOSH was reporting evidence of a black lung resurgence that was \u201cunprecedented by any historical standard,\u201d echoing the results from NPR\u2019s investigation, which found 962 cases of advanced black lung across the region in the previous ten years.\nWhy were cases of black lung rising exponentially at a time when U.S. coal consumption was in decline, and why had NIOSH been underreporting cases of black lung? We now have some idea, due to the persistence of diligent reporters and whistle-blowing physicians like Crum.\nWhy were cases of black lung rising exponentially at a time when U.S. coal consumption was in decline, and why had NIOSH been underreporting cases of black lung?\nThe term \u201ccoal mining\u201d conjures up images of subterranean tunnels, but modern mining in Appalachia has moved closer to the surface over the last three decades to allow coal operators to access rockier, thinner seams of coal. These seams have a mineral composition that is heavy in silica. Silica is more dangerous than coal dust, but the government\u2019s Mine Safety and Health Administration links most of its safety protocols to coal dust testing alone and does not require air sampling for toxic dust if coal is not present.\nBerkes, the reporter, confirmed that the agency has been aware of the dangers posed by these and other loopholes since the late 1980s, but had failed to adopt new rules until the Obama Administration, in part due to pressure from the mining industry and its political allies.\nNIOSH offers black lung screening, but the federal program is voluntary and underused. NIOSH tells miners that it keeps their health data confidential, but with the industry shrinking every year, miners have been reluctant to use the program for fear that this might make them targets for early termination. NIOSH does not screen retired or laid-off miners.\nWhen retired or laid-off miners do initiate health screenings, it is often to assess their eligibility for state and federal disability benefits, and clinics like Crum\u2019s, which are located throughout Appalachia, assist miners with this process. The presence of significant black lung clusters, then, is a combination of the consequences of known safety loopholes and wave after wave of job losses that have led to more frequent contact between former miners and health professionals.\nThat is the nuanced and concise explanation for the current resurgence, but the blunt answer is important, too: Miners are dying because it has always been acceptable to kill them.\nIn January 2019, NPR and PBS Frontline capped off a two-year investigation into the new black lung epidemic with the documentary Coal\u2019s Deadly Dust. The documentary humanized miners, detaching them from the highly politicized lens of Trump\u2019s coal industry pandering. Producers captured a moving record of the distressing health challenges miners face, interspersed with interviews between Howard Berkes and mine safety officials who served in administrations dating back to Clinton.\nThe documentary also happened to air just weeks before the fiftieth anniversary of an event not well remembered outside of Appalachia: 1969\u2019s black lung strikes. During this pivotal moment in West Virginia\u2019s history, progressive politicians, a sympathetic public, and, most importantly, dissenting workers willing to pressure the industry from within created conditions favorable to the passage of our modern mine health and safety laws.\nExploring past struggles to secure worker protections should be an occasion to reflect on the nation\u2019s progress. But the need for reform today might actually be greater than it was fifty years ago. The current U.S. President is bent on deregulating the coal industry, even though this has failed to spur coal recovery, and much of the public is hostile to miners for their perceived alliance with Trump. On their own, miners lack the kind of critical mass necessary to bring industry to their will.\nAnd yet, understanding broken promises requires learning the terms under which they were forged.\nIn 1968, an explosion at a mine in Farmington, West Virginia, killed seventy-eight miners. The accident occurred at a time when the gulf between union leaders and workers was wider than it had ever been.\nTony Boyle, the unpopular president of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), who would later be convicted of the murder of his challenger, Joseph Yablonski, downplayed the explosion.\n\u201cI share the grief. I\u2019ve lost relatives in a mine explosion,\u201d he said after Farmington. \u201cBut as long as we mine coal, there is always this inherent danger of explosion.\u201d Boyle\u2019s apparent indifference to the deaths of miners caused widespread dissent among the rank-and-file, including the widows and children of dead workers.\nThe Farmington disaster received substantial media coverage. Just months earlier, a mine flooding in Hominy Falls, West Virginia, had required a five-day rescue operation. Hoping for a similar dramatic outcome, the national press dispatched reporters to Farmington. Miners and community members, including local physicians, seized the opportunity to air their grievances about inadequate mine safety and the apathy of the union on a national stage.\nThis level of scrutiny and the resulting outcry helped prompt federal and state hearings about the disaster and the broader issues of mine safety. For West Virginia miners, it was of utmost importance that any discussion of reform include laws mandating compensation for sick and injured miners, particularly those with black lung.\nIn January 1969, a contingent of West Virginia miners formed the first chapter of the Black Lung Association (BLA) to mobilize support for new compensation laws. By the end of the month, thousands of miners were attending BLA meetings, and the organization could count a number of progressive physicians and lawmakers among its supporters.\nWhen the BLA called upon the union for support, Boyle refused and threatened to expel participating members. In February 1969, several hundred miners in Raleigh County, West Virginia, went on strike to protest a management decision. Their walkout quickly spread as miners statewide seized the opportunity to escalate the strike as a means to pressure coal operators, their union, and lawmakers to support mine safety and compensation reform.\nBy the end of February, more than 40,000 miners in West Virginia were engaged in a \u201cno law, no coal\u201d strike. Strike assistance from disabled miners, widows, and children was organized by the West Virginia-based dissident group Miners for Democracy.\nThe strike was long, but ultimately successful. West Virginia passed a compensation bill in early March, and in December 1969 President Nixon signed the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act into law. The act set stricter limits on acceptable levels of coal dust and established a federally backed compensation program for sick and injured miners. Congress strengthened provisions relating to black lung in 1972 in a separate act of law, the Black Lung Benefits Act.\nDuring the last fifty years, the Mine Safety and Health Administration estimates that 76,000 miners have died from black lung. The hard-won 1969 and 1972 laws were meant to provide clarity about the coal industry\u2019s financial obligations to disabled miners and prevent the coal industry from passing on its obligations to taxpayers.\nBut successive administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have allowed the coal industry more and more leeway to do exactly that. The federal government has paid out $45 billion in black lung compensation since 1968, and the fund that pays claims on behalf of the coal industry is currently $4.3 billion in debt.\nIn order to fund black lung benefits, Congress established the Black Lung Disability Benefit Trust and created a provision to fund it through an excise tax charged to the coal industry. Disabled miners or the dependents of deceased miners, currently about 25,000 claimants, draw from the fund for payments that range from $660.10 a month for a single person to $1,320.10 for a family. And although they\u2019re given little assistance, those claimants are fortunate.\nThe process of attaining benefits remains filled with bureaucratic hurdles and allows employers to challenge claims. Environmental reporter David Hasemyer found that coal industry employers resist 70 percent of benefit claims, meaning that between adversarial challenges and strict disability criteria, fewer than one in ten applications for black lung benefits are approved.\nA resurgence in black lung is unlikely to marshal resources to improve the benefits process for claimants. On a federal level, Congress authorized additional funding in 2018 to study the epidemic, but Kentucky recently passed a law intended to make it more difficult to file a claim.\nAs a result, radiologists in Kentucky are no longer allowed to diagnose black lung for the purposes of a benefit claim, meaning that physicians like Crum, who brought the epidemic to the attention of NIOSH, must defer to certified pulmonologists. As of last year, there were only six physicians in the state that can diagnose black lung and at least four of those have a history of helping the coal industry with claim appeals.\nThere are only six physicians in the state that can diagnose black lung and at least four of those have a history of helping the coal industry with claim appeals.\nMoreover, those approved for benefits must endure the yearly ritual each December to see if Congress will reauthorize the tax provision that funds their benefits. In 2018, with a Republican majority, Congress let the provision die. The government can still collect taxes for sick miners, but the coal industry is now paying taxes set at a rate that dates from when the trust was created in the 1970s.\nIn 2017, the Trump Administration provided another gift to the coal industry executives when it appointed David Zatezalo, a former coal executive, to lead the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Zatezalo was twice cited by the agency for serious safety violations. In short order, he announced plans to review new dust standards, a move that likely signals the agency intends to reverse the stricter Obama-era rules regarding acceptable dust limits at mining sites.\nWhen these rules went into effect in 2014, four years after they were proposed and arguably forty years after they were needed, Obama\u2019s Secretary of Labor Tom Perez declared, \u201cToday we advance a very basic principle: You shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice your life for your livelihood.\u201d I prefer the Ken Hechler version of this sentiment. Hechler was a West Virginia lawmaker who supported the 1969 black lung strike and pledged to his constituents, \u201cNo longer are we going to live and work and die like animals.\u201d\nOne senses that, as 2020 approaches, every concern must now be wrapped in a politically expedient narrative. This does not bode well for Appalachia, where both conservatives and progressives often see a place where people take much more than they contribute. But the gift of Appalachia\u2014and the story of black lung and the worker uprisings that sought justice for the coal industry\u2019s victims\u2014is the lesson that narratives don\u2019t have to be expedient, only true.",

                "html": "<p>For a convicted felon dumb enough to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/politics/mueller-paul-manafort-cooperation.html\">lie</a> to Robert Mueller after agreeing to a plea bargain, Paul Manafort sure gets a lot of credit. To some, he&rsquo;s the man who took a drifting presidential campaign and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/30/politics/paul-manafort-trump-convention-delegate-guru/index.html\">helped deliver</a> an unlikely nomination for Donald Trump. This represented a triumphant return to domestic politics after a decade in Ukraine, where Manafort polished the previously unelectable Viktor Yanukovych and took him to an improbable <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_presidential_election,_2010\">2010 victory</a> as that nation&rsquo;s president.</p>\n<p>But dig a little deeper into Manafort&rsquo;s time in Ukraine and a different picture emerges. Under President Yanukovych, Ukraine was a kleptocracy run by and for a gang of crooks who had carved up the country after the fall of the Soviet Union. Manafort may have introduced Yanukovych to power dressing, a good barber, and a neat line in soundbites. But, in the end, this made little difference in an election already bought and paid for.</p>\n<p>So why was Manafort paid vast sums (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/paul-manafort-made-more-than-60-million-in-ukraine-prosecutors-say/2018/07/30/dfe5b47c-9417-11e8-810c-5fa705927d54_story.html?utm_term=.a50e748ec6f6\">more than $60 million</a> at last count) if his brand of political consultancy wasn&rsquo;t essential for victory? It was because Manafort gave the campaign the international respectability it needed to conduct a huge money-laundering operation necessary to handle the theft of the country&rsquo;s wealth.</p>\n<p>Manafort, of course, is now in jail, having been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/us/politics/paul-manafort-trial-verdict.html\">convicted</a> of multiple counts of financial fraud related to his role in Ukraine. In November, he was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/politics/mueller-paul-manafort-cooperation.html?module=inline\">accused</a> by Robert Mueller, the special counsel looking into ties between the Trump Administration and Russia, of lying to federal investigators, putting his plea bargain at risk.</p>\n<p>The underlying criminal charges against Manafort deal with how he tried to bring the money he had earned in Ukraine into the United States by illegal means, but do not fully explain why Manafort was working for players in Ukraine or the nature of their work together. It is true that Manafort&rsquo;s political savvy and experience were attractive to the men behind Yanukovych. A longtime political consultant who specialized in representing repressive regimes, Manafort knew how to lobby successfully in the United States and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Manafort&rsquo;s record indicates that he didn&rsquo;t give a damn who he worked for&mdash;just as long as the money came in. He had <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/manaforts-former-clientele-27b927f175c7/\">earned significant amounts</a> <a href=\"http://https//www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/2016-donald-trump-paul-manafort-ferinand-marcos-philippines-1980s-213952\">in the service of military dictators </a>including Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Mobutu Sese Seko of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire). He also worked extensively with the Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. All three resorted to oppression, abduction, murder, and torture to achieve their political goals, and enriched themselves in the process.</p>\n<p>None of this perturbed Manafort unduly, and he was paid handsomely for his services, which included helping these figures legitimize the millions they had stolen from their countries. One of Imelda Marcos&rsquo;s last acts before fleeing the Philippines was to get Manafort on the phone to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/2016-donald-trump-paul-manafort-ferinand-marcos-philippines-1980s-213952\">thank him</a> for his efforts. His reputation in the Philippines was such that one member of Congress there, former journalist Teddy Locsin, said, &ldquo;Manafort&rsquo;s name [then] was like Voldemort today.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Although Manafort&rsquo;s client was Yanukovych, his route to Ukraine was via Russia. His first contact was with long-time Putin ally Oleg Deripaska, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/24/business.russia\">became</a> one of the richest and most influential men in Russia after emerging on top from the bloody <a href=\"http://https//www.europeanceo.com/profiles/oleg-deripaska-and-the-russian-aluminium-wars/\">aluminium wars of the 1990s</a>.</p>\n<p>Manafort was keen for a role in Russia and <a href=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/ex-trump-campaign-chief-paul-manafort-paid-10m-yr-to-help-putin/article/488561\">pitched</a> for a $10 million a year job to, as one <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/03/22/paul-manafort-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-russia-ukraine/\">news account</a> put it, &ldquo;influence politics, business dealings, and news coverage inside the United States . . . to benefit the Putin government.&rdquo; Instead Deripaska <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/from-six-homes-to-a-city-jail----paul-manafort-who-redefined-lobbying-faces-trial/2018/07/26/2f1650fa-89d3-11e8-85ae-511bc1146b0b_story.html?utm_term=.b00fc004573f\">passed him</a> on to Rinat Akhmetov. Akhmetov is Ukraine&rsquo;s wealthiest oligarch and its most influential power broker.</p>\n<blockquote><p>While Manafort&rsquo;s role was not key to the 2010 election, it was crucial in legitimizing the Yanukovych presidency and cranking up of the kleptocracy.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Manafort was initially unimpressed with Yanukovych, convinced he could never win. But Yanukovych was Putin&rsquo;s favored candidate, and he wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere. He headed the Party of Regions, a criminal organization <a href=\"https://jamestown.org/program/yanukovych-provides-a-krysha-for-organized-crime/\">masquerading</a> as Ukraine&rsquo;s largest political party. With the backing of most of the country&rsquo;s leading oligarchs and the full support of the Kremlin, the party seemed likely to be in power for a long time.</p>\n<p>But in 2005, when Manafort came into the picture, the Party of Regions was in disarray. The party had been <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2005-03-01/ukraines-orange-revolution\">caught</a> rigging the election and was deposed in a popular uprising. With corrupt leaders <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution\">unseated</a> by th<a href=\"http://https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution\">e Orange Revolution</a>, rival Viktor Yushchenko assumed the presidency with a mandate to reform the system and root out corruption. Infighting with former President Leonid Kuchma had <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296946094_From_Kuchma_to_Yushchenko_Ukraine's_2004_Presidential_Elections_and_the_Orange_Revolution/download\">obstructed</a> party members in Donbas and Crimea, meaning that <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/1056378.html\">cheating</a> was their only recourse to assuming power.</p>\n<p>They had also been rocked by the 2004 <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/1053203.html\">conviction</a> in the United States of former Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko for extortion and money-laundering. He is thought to have stolen around $200 million from the Ukrainian government. Lazarenko admitted that he had used his position to make a fortune, but said that this &ldquo;had been usual and acceptable behavior in the 1990s in Ukraine.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Yanukovych and the oligarchs behind him saw Lazarenko&rsquo;s conviction as a threat to their lucrative racket. They needed to improve their image abroad to allow them to clean their money offshore. Manafort was brought in to do that for them.</p>\n<p>Manafort went to work on creating a Western-style campaign for Yanukovych, and introduced him to the world&rsquo;s political elite. He was <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/rick-gates-claims-that-he-and-paul-manafort-are-tax-evading-money-laundering-criminals\">tasked</a> with coordinating the wide network of offshore accounts, businesses, and banks to ease the movement of money abroad. He <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/kzkykm/the-hapsburg-group-paul-manaforts-shadowy-european-network-explained\">developed</a> relations with powerful U.S. political actors who would be friendly to Yanukovych&rsquo;s Ukraine and worked to improve the image of the oligarchy abroad.</p>\n<p>In the process, Manafort got close to Yanukovych, regularly visiting his opulent <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/inside-the-opulence-of-yanukovichs-estate/\">Mezhyhirya</a> estate, with its private zoo and gilded bathrooms. He was Yanukovych&rsquo;s preferred tennis partner, usually letting him win, and they would swim naked together in the private lake next to where Yanukovych&rsquo;s personal galleon was moored.</p>\n<p>Manafort began to reassess his view of Yanukovych. He had certainly underestimated Yanukovych&rsquo;s power base. Russian political consultant Gleb Pavlovsky, who was heavily involved in Ukrainian politics before 2005, recently said in an interview for this article, &ldquo;Yanukovych wasn&rsquo;t a weak candidate. President Kuchma had prevented him from mobilizing the Donbas in 2004 and he lost. In 2010 he mobilized the Donbas and Crimea and that made the difference.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Asked whether Manafort changed the image and presentation of the rough and ready Yanukovych, Pavlovsky said, &ldquo;Yes, but that was the easy part!&rdquo; The main political strategy was devised in Ukraine. Manafort went along with it and focused on the presentation.</p>\n<p>While Manafort&rsquo;s role was not key to the 2010 election, it was crucial in legitimizing the Yanukovych presidency and enabling the cranking up of the kleptocracy following his victory. Two major factors in the victory were unconnected to Manafort.</p>\n<p>The first was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/17/viktor-yushchenko-testifies-against-yulia-tymoshenko\">collapse</a> of the Yushchenko government after a falling out with his Orange Revolution partner, Yulia Tymoshenko. To survive in government, President Yushchenko had to make <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/1061785.html\">deals</a> with the oligarch Akhmetov; this strengthened his hold on power, but stifled his ability to enact reforms. He was even forced to <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/1070340.html\">accept</a> Yanukovych as prime minister in 2006.</p>\n<p>The second factor was the Donbas, a region of Ukraine in which Akhmetov had almost total control. Its industrial base was <a href=\"https://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/136673\">dominated</a> by coal and steel, all owned by Akhmetov. Essentially, the region&rsquo;s whole population was his workforce. And where Akhmetov could not direct votes, Yanukovych and the Party of Regions controlled the voting systems, so they had carte blanche to ballot-stuff to bring in the number of votes they needed. Yanukovych received <a href=\"http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vp2010/WP313?PT001F01=701\">90 percent</a> of votes in the Donbas region. In several districts, and in all prisons and hospitals, the result was <a href=\"http://statistika.in.ua/prez2010/yavka2tur/donetska\">100 percent.</a></p>\n<p>While Manafort&rsquo;s role may have been incidental to Yanukovych&rsquo;s win, it was crucial in what came next&mdash;the looting of a country&rsquo;s assets on an industrial scale.</p>\n<p>Brian Whitmore of the Center for European Policy Analysis once said in a podcast: &ldquo;Corruption in Russia is not a glitch in the matrix. Corruption is the matrix.&rdquo; This was equally true of post-Soviet Ukraine, where politics and corruption were indivisible.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://https//www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results\">Transparency International&rsquo;s Corruption Perception Index</a>, in 2014 Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results\">ranked</a> the 142nd worst out of 175 countries for corruption. What was purportedly a modern democracy was in fact a kleptocracy, run by about a dozen men made wealthy by privatization deals following the fall of communism and the breakup of the Soviet Union.</p>\n<p>In the Ukraine of the time, it was impossible to separate politics, business, and crime. They were all one. Election campaigns were some of the <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Aslund-25-3.pdf\">most expensive</a> in the world. The total amount spent by all candidates in a typical presidential election or in races for the 450-seat parliament was $2 billion, or 1 percent of GDP. In GDP terms, this is 2,000 times more than is spent on an average U.S. election campaign.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Seats in Ukraine&rsquo;s parliament could be bought and sold, and the millions candidates and parties spent to get elected would be repaid, many times over, with the levers of government at their disposal.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Seats in Ukraine&rsquo;s parliament could be bought and sold. According to a <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Aslund-25-3.pdf\">report</a> by Anders &Aring;slund, then a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C., &ldquo;A safe seat in Parliament could fetch up to $5 million.&rdquo; Speculators would buy a seat and then sell it off to the winning party at a handsome profit. In turn, the winning party would sell off government posts that gave opportunities for graft and personal advancement.</p>\n<p>However many millions candidates and parties spent to get elected would be repaid, many times over, with the levers of government at their disposal. The most savvy businessmen would seek to buy and control a bloc of votes to better influence policy and budgets in their favor. The entire political apparatus was set up for corruption. The country never stood a chance.</p>\n<p>There were several ways that a Ukrainian oligarch could divest himself of his ill-gotten gains. The first was to reinvest in politics. This might be through rewards or kickbacks to others who had helped, the buying of further political influence, or currying favor with political leaders in either Ukraine or Russia.</p>\n<p>For example, &ldquo;Gas King&rdquo; Dmytro Firtash, currently in Austria awaiting <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/top-eu-court-rejects-extradition-appeal-by-ukrainian-oligarch-firtash/29562112.html\">extradition</a> to the United States on bribery charges, used his wealth to <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/khoroshkovsky-sells-inter-channel-to-firtash-319674.html\">buy up</a> key TV stations in Ukraine, which were then tasked with supporting Yanukovych and the Party of Regions, and attacking the European Union and the West. This was his version of paying a tribute. And to keep the whole system going, Yanukovych is thought to have had $3 billion squirreled away as a war chest for Manafort and the Party of Regions to spend during the next elections, according to the &Aring;slund report.</p>\n<p>For the rest, Manafort&rsquo;s business partner Rick Gates <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/rick-gates-delivers-a-public-lesson-on-money-laundering-and-political-corruption\">described</a> in court testimony how he and Manafort had laundered money for several Ukrainian oligarchs by setting up offshore shell companies and bank accounts, mostly in Cyprus.</p>\n<p>Yanukovych and Manafort&rsquo;s cozy project came crashing down in early 2014, when the Maidan Revolution <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Ukrainian_revolution\">toppled the government</a> and sent Yanukovych scurrying to Russia. The Yanukovych clan had gotten too greedy. In his final year in power, Yanukovych had <a href=\"http://yanukovich.info/oleksandr-yanukovych-assets/\">granted</a> hundreds of millions of dollars worth of state contracts to his dentist son, Oleksandr, making him <a href=\"http://yanukovich.info/oleksandr-yanukovych-assets/\">one of the wealthiest men in Ukraine</a> at the time. Another beneficiary was then-twenty-seven-year-old <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/sergii-leshchenko/in-ukraine-it-grows-on-trees\">Serhiy Kurchenko</a>, who in a single year built a business empire in oil refining, media, energy, and banking worth more than $3 billion, due to Yanukovych&rsquo;s patronage.</p>\n<p>The Yanukovych family had tried to act against the laws of economics. About 60 percent of the Ukrainian economy was in &ldquo;shadow,&rdquo; so the government was not able to replenish public finances through conventional methods like taxation. But the biggest surprise for Yanukovych and Manafort were the Ukrainians, who became fed up with corruption and poverty. Yanukovych&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25162563\">refusal</a> to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/17/ukraine-russia-leaders-talks-kremlin-loan-deal\">followed by</a> the promise of a $15 billion loan from Putin, kick-started the chain of events that led to the Maidan Revolution. [Editor's note: The original and print version of this article incorrectly stated Yanukovych's refusal to sign this agreement with the EU followed the loan promise, when the refusal actually preceded it. A correction will appear in the magazine's next issue.]</p>\n<p>What began as a peaceful demonstration about the nonsigning of a treaty <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Euromaidan\">escalated</a> quickly into a bloody conflict due to a series of desperate and disastrous decisions, which cranked up the tension and made the protesters feel that they had less to lose. Where was the skilled political strategist in all this? Was Manafort counseling Yanukovych on the folly of his actions? He was surely aware how it looked to the Western world.</p>\n<p>Could Manafort have had an even more direct role in the last bloody days of the Yanukovych regime? In a series of hacked <a href=\"https://mavenroundtable.io/theintellectualist/news/in-series-of-text-messages-paul-manafort-s-daughter-implicates-her-father-in-mass-murder-3QYf7RjMh0a8yRWFEc-LsA/\">SMS messages</a> between Manafort&rsquo;s two daughters, Andrea Manafort suggested that it was her father&rsquo;s strategy to cause &ldquo;the revolts and what not . . . as a tactic to outrage the world and get focus on Ukraine.&rdquo; She claims it was their father&rsquo;s idea to &ldquo;send those people out and get them slaughtered&rdquo; on <a href=\"http://https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGeh4X1ORUM\">the fateful morning of February 2</a>0, 2014.</p>\n<p>On the morning in question, the riot police suddenly retreated from their positions surrounding the protesters in Independence Square in Kiev. Sensing victory, the protesters pursued the police up the hill in the direction of parliament. Back at the main square, people around the stage started to suspect something was amiss. It looked too easy. Through the public address system, they implored the protesters to return. But it was too late.</p>\n<p>The protesters flooded into the area vacated by the riot police only to be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26866069\">met by</a> sniper fire. With their wooden shields and yellow construction helmets, they were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGeh4X1ORUM\">picked off</a> one by one. Many were killed trying to treat fallen comrades or to drag them back to the barricades. More than fifty protesters lost their lives in the bloodiest day of the revolution.</p>\n<blockquote><p>More than fifty protesters lost their lives in the bloodiest day of the revolution.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that Manafort&rsquo;s daughter, in the hacked SMS messages, described their family&rsquo;s wealth as &ldquo;blood money.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After Yanukovych fled, Manafort stayed in Ukraine for a while to rebrand the remnants of the disgraced Party of Regions as the Opposition Bloc and establish them as a parliamentary force. He then returned to America and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/us/politics/paul-manafort-trump-campaign.html\">offered</a> his services for free to the Trump campaign.</p>\n<p>It is out of character for Paul Manafort to work for nothing, particularly when he&rsquo;d just lost such a lucrative income stream. As Kiev-based political commentator Paul Niland recently said in an interview for this article, &ldquo;Manafort&rsquo;s an opportunist. He always went wherever the money was. When there was a way of getting onto Trump&rsquo;s team, there will have been money coming to him from somewhere or an assumption that in the future there would be.&rdquo; We can only speculate who or where the source of that money would be.</p>\n<p>The Paul Manafort who presented himself to Trump certainly had an impressive track record in political campaigning in America and around the world. But he also had a back story of dishonest failure. A trail of corruption and crime, always leaving countries under a cloud, his clients fleeing or incarcerated. A man who, in the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/paul-manafort-daughter-text-messages-ukraine-2017-3\">words of</a> his own daughter, &ldquo;had no moral or legal compass.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The smallest amount of due diligence would have brought this to Trump&rsquo;s attention and highlighted the dangers of associating with a man like Manafort. Or Trump may have known about all the dirt on Manafort and just didn&rsquo;t care. Or could it be that Manafort&rsquo;s experience and contacts from his time in Ukraine were exactly what Trump was looking for?</p>\n<h3>Sidebar: How a Ukranian Leader Robbed His Own Country</h3>\n<p>It is difficult to get a handle on the total amount that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his allies took out of the country during his time in office, from 2010 to his removal in 2014. That&rsquo;s because they used a myriad of methods and shadow accounts to achieve their aims. Economist Anders &Aring;slund gave a detailed estimate of the amounts and the methods used in his 2014 report, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Aslund-25-3.pdf\">Oligarchs, Corruption, and European Integration</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4>1. The gas trade</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-01-25 at 11.35.04 AM.png\" data-src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/11794/download/Screen%20Shot%202019-01-25%20at%2011.35.04%20AM.png?cb=d18019a8e93dc8bb573de479d1ceee69&w={width}&h={height}\" data-widths=\"[100, 150, 188]\" sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/11794/download/Screen%20Shot%202019-01-25%20at%2011.35.04%20AM.png?cb=d18019a8e93dc8bb573de479d1ceee69&w={width}&h={height}\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></figure>\n<p>For any oligarch wanting to acquire serious wealth, control of state gas monopoly Naftogaz was the most effective method. Government subsidies kept the price of natural gas piped from Russia artificially low, which benefited Ukrainian households during the cold winters.</p>\n<p>However, 8 percent of the nation&rsquo;s GDP was spent each year on subsidizing Naftogaz, and the main beneficiary was not the Ukrainian consumer. A few businessmen in Russia and Ukraine managed to shave off billions by diverting some of the gas and selling it to industry at vastly inflated rates. Gas could be bought at $53 per 1,000 cubic meters and sold for as much as $410.</p>\n<p>It is thought that corruption in the gas sector yielded profits of more than $3 billion a year. And then there was the opportunity cost. Today, a properly regulated gas industry is Ukraine&rsquo;s biggest taxpayer, <a href=\"http://www.naftogaz.com/www/3/nakweben.nsf/0/A5D26EB11091BF81C225820A002853F4?OpenDocument&year=2018&month=01&nt=News&\">contributing</a> 14 percent of the total revenues of the state budget.</p>\n<h4>2. Infrastructure tenders</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-01-25 at 11.35.17 AM.png\" data-src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/11795/download/Screen%20Shot%202019-01-25%20at%2011.35.17%20AM.png?cb=70c7a66bf59bebb8605acbedca9da847&w={width}&h={height}\" data-widths=\"[100, 150, 189]\" sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/11795/download/Screen%20Shot%202019-01-25%20at%2011.35.17%20AM.png?cb=70c7a66bf59bebb8605acbedca9da847&w={width}&h={height}\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></figure>\n<p>Each year, Yanukovych doled out large infrastructure projects to friends and family. There was little to nothing by way of oversight or transparency. He was fortunate to become president just as Ukraine was <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/all-eyes-are-on-ukraine-for-2012-european-football-championship-a-834211.html\">preparing</a> to co-host the prestigious UEFA European Championship, so there was a lot of money to go around.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s thought that the state paid double the real cost of each project. Corruption is not unheard of in government procurement around the world, but kickbacks of 50 percent are unusually high. The process is believed to have enriched the Yanukovych clan to the tune of $2 billion a year.</p>\n<h4>3. State budget</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-01-25 at 11.35.27 AM.png\" data-src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/11796/download/Screen%20Shot%202019-01-25%20at%2011.35.27%20AM.png?cb=c8c80d1ceab1b8f2aee5ad45240f8252&w={width}&h={height}\" data-widths=\"[100, 150, 188]\" sizes=\"auto\" src=\"https://progressive.org/downloads/11796/download/Screen%20Shot%202019-01-25%20at%2011.35.27%20AM.png?cb=c8c80d1ceab1b8f2aee5ad45240f8252&w={width}&h={height}\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></img></figure>\n<p>It is telling that Ukrainian has its own word&mdash;<em>deriban</em>&mdash;for theft from the state budget. It&rsquo;s difficult to do, but there is an art to it, and Yanukovych clearly mastered this art. He is reported to have stolen $3 billion to $5 billion per year from state budgets.</p>\n<p>&Aring;slund has calculated that during his five years in power, Yanukovych and his clan plundered between $8 billion and $10 billion per year from the Ukrainian state. And that was only due to public corruption; they made a lot of money privately, too. A key method was &ldquo;corporate raiding,&rdquo; where the Yanukovych family forced a sale of a company at a price way below its market value.</p>\n<p>Ukraine&rsquo;s general prosecutor has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42950097\">estimated</a> that Yanukovych and his associates stole a total of $40 billion from the state during Yanukovych&rsquo;s time as president, and he personally amassed a fortune of $12 billion, according to &Aring;slund&rsquo;s report. Even in a region where corruption is rife, the scale of the theft is shocking.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My assessment is that Putin and his cronies steal $15 billion to $25 billion a year from the Russian government,&rdquo; &Aring;slund says in an interview. &ldquo;But the Russian economy is $1.6 trillion and the Ukrainian economy under Yanukovych was $180 billion, so the share of the economy that Yanukovych stole was much greater.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "For a convicted felon dumb enough to lie to Robert Mueller after agreeing to a plea bargain, Paul Manafort sure gets a lot of credit. To some, he\u2019s the man who took a drifting presidential campaign and helped deliver an unlikely nomination for Donald Trump. This represented a triumphant return to domestic politics after a decade in Ukraine, where Manafort polished the previously unelectable Viktor Yanukovych and took him to an improbable 2010 victory as that nation\u2019s president.\nBut dig a little deeper into Manafort\u2019s time in Ukraine and a different picture emerges. Under President Yanukovych, Ukraine was a kleptocracy run by and for a gang of crooks who had carved up the country after the fall of the Soviet Union. Manafort may have introduced Yanukovych to power dressing, a good barber, and a neat line in soundbites. But, in the end, this made little difference in an election already bought and paid for.\nSo why was Manafort paid vast sums (more than $60 million at last count) if his brand of political consultancy wasn\u2019t essential for victory? It was because Manafort gave the campaign the international respectability it needed to conduct a huge money-laundering operation necessary to handle the theft of the country\u2019s wealth.\nManafort, of course, is now in jail, having been convicted of multiple counts of financial fraud related to his role in Ukraine. In November, he was accused by Robert Mueller, the special counsel looking into ties between the Trump Administration and Russia, of lying to federal investigators, putting his plea bargain at risk.\nThe underlying criminal charges against Manafort deal with how he tried to bring the money he had earned in Ukraine into the United States by illegal means, but do not fully explain why Manafort was working for players in Ukraine or the nature of their work together. It is true that Manafort\u2019s political savvy and experience were attractive to the men behind Yanukovych. A longtime political consultant who specialized in representing repressive regimes, Manafort knew how to lobby successfully in the United States and elsewhere.\nMoreover, Manafort\u2019s record indicates that he didn\u2019t give a damn who he worked for\u2014just as long as the money came in. He had earned significant amounts in the service of military dictators including Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Mobutu Sese Seko of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire). He also worked extensively with the Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. All three resorted to oppression, abduction, murder, and torture to achieve their political goals, and enriched themselves in the process.\nNone of this perturbed Manafort unduly, and he was paid handsomely for his services, which included helping these figures legitimize the millions they had stolen from their countries. One of Imelda Marcos\u2019s last acts before fleeing the Philippines was to get Manafort on the phone to thank him for his efforts. His reputation in the Philippines was such that one member of Congress there, former journalist Teddy Locsin, said, \u201cManafort\u2019s name [then] was like Voldemort today.\u201d\nAlthough Manafort\u2019s client was Yanukovych, his route to Ukraine was via Russia. His first contact was with long-time Putin ally Oleg Deripaska, who became one of the richest and most influential men in Russia after emerging on top from the bloody aluminium wars of the 1990s.\nManafort was keen for a role in Russia and pitched for a $10 million a year job to, as one news account put it, \u201cinfluence politics, business dealings, and news coverage inside the United States . . . to benefit the Putin government.\u201d Instead Deripaska passed him on to Rinat Akhmetov. Akhmetov is Ukraine\u2019s wealthiest oligarch and its most influential power broker.\nWhile Manafort\u2019s role was not key to the 2010 election, it was crucial in legitimizing the Yanukovych presidency and cranking up of the kleptocracy.\nManafort was initially unimpressed with Yanukovych, convinced he could never win. But Yanukovych was Putin\u2019s favored candidate, and he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. He headed the Party of Regions, a criminal organization masquerading as Ukraine\u2019s largest political party. With the backing of most of the country\u2019s leading oligarchs and the full support of the Kremlin, the party seemed likely to be in power for a long time.\nBut in 2005, when Manafort came into the picture, the Party of Regions was in disarray. The party had been caught rigging the election and was deposed in a popular uprising. With corrupt leaders unseated by the Orange Revolution, rival Viktor Yushchenko assumed the presidency with a mandate to reform the system and root out corruption. Infighting with former President Leonid Kuchma had obstructed party members in Donbas and Crimea, meaning that cheating was their only recourse to assuming power.\nThey had also been rocked by the 2004 conviction in the United States of former Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko for extortion and money-laundering. He is thought to have stolen around $200 million from the Ukrainian government. Lazarenko admitted that he had used his position to make a fortune, but said that this \u201chad been usual and acceptable behavior in the 1990s in Ukraine.\u201d\nYanukovych and the oligarchs behind him saw Lazarenko\u2019s conviction as a threat to their lucrative racket. They needed to improve their image abroad to allow them to clean their money offshore. Manafort was brought in to do that for them.\nManafort went to work on creating a Western-style campaign for Yanukovych, and introduced him to the world\u2019s political elite. He was tasked with coordinating the wide network of offshore accounts, businesses, and banks to ease the movement of money abroad. He developed relations with powerful U.S. political actors who would be friendly to Yanukovych\u2019s Ukraine and worked to improve the image of the oligarchy abroad.\nIn the process, Manafort got close to Yanukovych, regularly visiting his opulent Mezhyhirya estate, with its private zoo and gilded bathrooms. He was Yanukovych\u2019s preferred tennis partner, usually letting him win, and they would swim naked together in the private lake next to where Yanukovych\u2019s personal galleon was moored.\nManafort began to reassess his view of Yanukovych. He had certainly underestimated Yanukovych\u2019s power base. Russian political consultant Gleb Pavlovsky, who was heavily involved in Ukrainian politics before 2005, recently said in an interview for this article, \u201cYanukovych wasn\u2019t a weak candidate. President Kuchma had prevented him from mobilizing the Donbas in 2004 and he lost. In 2010 he mobilized the Donbas and Crimea and that made the difference.\u201d\nAsked whether Manafort changed the image and presentation of the rough and ready Yanukovych, Pavlovsky said, \u201cYes, but that was the easy part!\u201d The main political strategy was devised in Ukraine. Manafort went along with it and focused on the presentation.\nWhile Manafort\u2019s role was not key to the 2010 election, it was crucial in legitimizing the Yanukovych presidency and enabling the cranking up of the kleptocracy following his victory. Two major factors in the victory were unconnected to Manafort.\nThe first was the collapse of the Yushchenko government after a falling out with his Orange Revolution partner, Yulia Tymoshenko. To survive in government, President Yushchenko had to make deals with the oligarch Akhmetov; this strengthened his hold on power, but stifled his ability to enact reforms. He was even forced to accept Yanukovych as prime minister in 2006.\nThe second factor was the Donbas, a region of Ukraine in which Akhmetov had almost total control. Its industrial base was dominated by coal and steel, all owned by Akhmetov. Essentially, the region\u2019s whole population was his workforce. And where Akhmetov could not direct votes, Yanukovych and the Party of Regions controlled the voting systems, so they had carte blanche to ballot-stuff to bring in the number of votes they needed. Yanukovych received 90 percent of votes in the Donbas region. In several districts, and in all prisons and hospitals, the result was 100 percent.\nWhile Manafort\u2019s role may have been incidental to Yanukovych\u2019s win, it was crucial in what came next\u2014the looting of a country\u2019s assets on an industrial scale.\nBrian Whitmore of the Center for European Policy Analysis once said in a podcast: \u201cCorruption in Russia is not a glitch in the matrix. Corruption is the matrix.\u201d This was equally true of post-Soviet Ukraine, where politics and corruption were indivisible.\nAccording to Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index, in 2014 Ukraine ranked the 142nd worst out of 175 countries for corruption. What was purportedly a modern democracy was in fact a kleptocracy, run by about a dozen men made wealthy by privatization deals following the fall of communism and the breakup of the Soviet Union.\nIn the Ukraine of the time, it was impossible to separate politics, business, and crime. They were all one. Election campaigns were some of the most expensive in the world. The total amount spent by all candidates in a typical presidential election or in races for the 450-seat parliament was $2 billion, or 1 percent of GDP. In GDP terms, this is 2,000 times more than is spent on an average U.S. election campaign.\nSeats in Ukraine\u2019s parliament could be bought and sold, and the millions candidates and parties spent to get elected would be repaid, many times over, with the levers of government at their disposal.\nSeats in Ukraine\u2019s parliament could be bought and sold. According to a report by Anders \u00c5slund, then a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C., \u201cA safe seat in Parliament could fetch up to $5 million.\u201d Speculators would buy a seat and then sell it off to the winning party at a handsome profit. In turn, the winning party would sell off government posts that gave opportunities for graft and personal advancement.\nHowever many millions candidates and parties spent to get elected would be repaid, many times over, with the levers of government at their disposal. The most savvy businessmen would seek to buy and control a bloc of votes to better influence policy and budgets in their favor. The entire political apparatus was set up for corruption. The country never stood a chance.\nThere were several ways that a Ukrainian oligarch could divest himself of his ill-gotten gains. The first was to reinvest in politics. This might be through rewards or kickbacks to others who had helped, the buying of further political influence, or currying favor with political leaders in either Ukraine or Russia.\nFor example, \u201cGas King\u201d Dmytro Firtash, currently in Austria awaiting extradition to the United States on bribery charges, used his wealth to buy up key TV stations in Ukraine, which were then tasked with supporting Yanukovych and the Party of Regions, and attacking the European Union and the West. This was his version of paying a tribute. And to keep the whole system going, Yanukovych is thought to have had $3 billion squirreled away as a war chest for Manafort and the Party of Regions to spend during the next elections, according to the \u00c5slund report.\nFor the rest, Manafort\u2019s business partner Rick Gates described in court testimony how he and Manafort had laundered money for several Ukrainian oligarchs by setting up offshore shell companies and bank accounts, mostly in Cyprus.\nYanukovych and Manafort\u2019s cozy project came crashing down in early 2014, when the Maidan Revolution toppled the government and sent Yanukovych scurrying to Russia. The Yanukovych clan had gotten too greedy. In his final year in power, Yanukovych had granted hundreds of millions of dollars worth of state contracts to his dentist son, Oleksandr, making him one of the wealthiest men in Ukraine at the time. Another beneficiary was then-twenty-seven-year-old Serhiy Kurchenko, who in a single year built a business empire in oil refining, media, energy, and banking worth more than $3 billion, due to Yanukovych\u2019s patronage.\nThe Yanukovych family had tried to act against the laws of economics. About 60 percent of the Ukrainian economy was in \u201cshadow,\u201d so the government was not able to replenish public finances through conventional methods like taxation. But the biggest surprise for Yanukovych and Manafort were the Ukrainians, who became fed up with corruption and poverty. Yanukovych\u2019s refusal to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union, followed by the promise of a $15 billion loan from Putin, kick-started the chain of events that led to the Maidan Revolution. [Editor's note: The original and print version of this article incorrectly stated Yanukovych's refusal to sign this agreement with the EU followed the loan promise, when the refusal actually preceded it. A correction will appear in the magazine's next issue.]\nWhat began as a peaceful demonstration about the nonsigning of a treaty escalated quickly into a bloody conflict due to a series of desperate and disastrous decisions, which cranked up the tension and made the protesters feel that they had less to lose. Where was the skilled political strategist in all this? Was Manafort counseling Yanukovych on the folly of his actions? He was surely aware how it looked to the Western world.\nCould Manafort have had an even more direct role in the last bloody days of the Yanukovych regime? In a series of hacked SMS messages between Manafort\u2019s two daughters, Andrea Manafort suggested that it was her father\u2019s strategy to cause \u201cthe revolts and what not . . . as a tactic to outrage the world and get focus on Ukraine.\u201d She claims it was their father\u2019s idea to \u201csend those people out and get them slaughtered\u201d on the fateful morning of February 20, 2014.\nOn the morning in question, the riot police suddenly retreated from their positions surrounding the protesters in Independence Square in Kiev. Sensing victory, the protesters pursued the police up the hill in the direction of parliament. Back at the main square, people around the stage started to suspect something was amiss. It looked too easy. Through the public address system, they implored the protesters to return. But it was too late.\nThe protesters flooded into the area vacated by the riot police only to be met by sniper fire. With their wooden shields and yellow construction helmets, they were picked off one by one. Many were killed trying to treat fallen comrades or to drag them back to the barricades. More than fifty protesters lost their lives in the bloodiest day of the revolution.\nMore than fifty protesters lost their lives in the bloodiest day of the revolution.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that Manafort\u2019s daughter, in the hacked SMS messages, described their family\u2019s wealth as \u201cblood money.\u201d\nAfter Yanukovych fled, Manafort stayed in Ukraine for a while to rebrand the remnants of the disgraced Party of Regions as the Opposition Bloc and establish them as a parliamentary force. He then returned to America and offered his services for free to the Trump campaign.\nIt is out of character for Paul Manafort to work for nothing, particularly when he\u2019d just lost such a lucrative income stream. As Kiev-based political commentator Paul Niland recently said in an interview for this article, \u201cManafort\u2019s an opportunist. He always went wherever the money was. When there was a way of getting onto Trump\u2019s team, there will have been money coming to him from somewhere or an assumption that in the future there would be.\u201d We can only speculate who or where the source of that money would be.\nThe Paul Manafort who presented himself to Trump certainly had an impressive track record in political campaigning in America and around the world. But he also had a back story of dishonest failure. A trail of corruption and crime, always leaving countries under a cloud, his clients fleeing or incarcerated. A man who, in the words of his own daughter, \u201chad no moral or legal compass.\u201d\nThe smallest amount of due diligence would have brought this to Trump\u2019s attention and highlighted the dangers of associating with a man like Manafort. Or Trump may have known about all the dirt on Manafort and just didn\u2019t care. Or could it be that Manafort\u2019s experience and contacts from his time in Ukraine were exactly what Trump was looking for?\nSidebar: How a Ukranian Leader Robbed His Own Country\nIt is difficult to get a handle on the total amount that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his allies took out of the country during his time in office, from 2010 to his removal in 2014. That\u2019s because they used a myriad of methods and shadow accounts to achieve their aims. Economist Anders \u00c5slund gave a detailed estimate of the amounts and the methods used in his 2014 report, \u201cOligarchs, Corruption, and European Integration.\u201d\n1. The gas trade\nFor any oligarch wanting to acquire serious wealth, control of state gas monopoly Naftogaz was the most effective method. Government subsidies kept the price of natural gas piped from Russia artificially low, which benefited Ukrainian households during the cold winters.\nHowever, 8 percent of the nation\u2019s GDP was spent each year on subsidizing Naftogaz, and the main beneficiary was not the Ukrainian consumer. A few businessmen in Russia and Ukraine managed to shave off billions by diverting some of the gas and selling it to industry at vastly inflated rates. Gas could be bought at $53 per 1,000 cubic meters and sold for as much as $410.\nIt is thought that corruption in the gas sector yielded profits of more than $3 billion a year. And then there was the opportunity cost. Today, a properly regulated gas industry is Ukraine\u2019s biggest taxpayer, contributing 14 percent of the total revenues of the state budget.\n2. Infrastructure tenders\nEach year, Yanukovych doled out large infrastructure projects to friends and family. There was little to nothing by way of oversight or transparency. He was fortunate to become president just as Ukraine was preparing to co-host the prestigious UEFA European Championship, so there was a lot of money to go around.\nIt\u2019s thought that the state paid double the real cost of each project. Corruption is not unheard of in government procurement around the world, but kickbacks of 50 percent are unusually high. The process is believed to have enriched the Yanukovych clan to the tune of $2 billion a year.\n3. State budget\nIt is telling that Ukrainian has its own word\u2014deriban\u2014for theft from the state budget. It\u2019s difficult to do, but there is an art to it, and Yanukovych clearly mastered this art. He is reported to have stolen $3 billion to $5 billion per year from state budgets.\n\u00c5slund has calculated that during his five years in power, Yanukovych and his clan plundered between $8 billion and $10 billion per year from the Ukrainian state. And that was only due to public corruption; they made a lot of money privately, too. A key method was \u201ccorporate raiding,\u201d where the Yanukovych family forced a sale of a company at a price way below its market value.\nUkraine\u2019s general prosecutor has estimated that Yanukovych and his associates stole a total of $40 billion from the state during Yanukovych\u2019s time as president, and he personally amassed a fortune of $12 billion, according to \u00c5slund\u2019s report. Even in a region where corruption is rife, the scale of the theft is shocking.\n\u201cMy assessment is that Putin and his cronies steal $15 billion to $25 billion a year from the Russian government,\u201d \u00c5slund says in an interview. \u201cBut the Russian economy is $1.6 trillion and the Ukrainian economy under Yanukovych was $180 billion, so the share of the economy that Yanukovych stole was much greater.\u201d",

                "html": "<p>According to a new report, the U.S. Department of Education has spent up to $1 billion on charter schools that never opened, or ended up closing for mismanagement and fraud.</p>\n<p>A hearing in the House of Representatives last week <a href=\"https://www.philly.com/politics/betsy-devos-defends-proposal-cut-billions-education-spending-20190327.html\">made headlines</a> when Democratic members grilled U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos about her budget proposing <a href=\"https://fox4kc.com/2019/03/26/devos-blasted-again-for-proposing-cuts-to-the-special-olympics/\">huge cuts</a> to programs&mdash;including Special Olympics, after-school programs, and special education&mdash;while calling for a double-digit increase for the department&rsquo;s charter school grant program.</p>\n<p>Referring to a <a href=\"http://networkforpubliceducation.org/asleepatthewheel/\">new report</a>, which I co-authored with Network for Public Education Executive Director Carol Burris, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, <a href=\"https://ctmirror.org/2019/03/26/delauro-takes-on-devos-failed-charter-schools-education-budget-cuts/\">told</a> DeVos in the hearing, &ldquo;This budget is full of cruel cuts to education programs, and it baffles me that you found room for a $60 million increase to the Charter School Program . . . especially when you consider recent reports of waste and abuse in the program.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The report, titled<strong> &ldquo;</strong>Asleep at the Wheel: How the Federal Charter Schools Program Recklessly Takes Taxpayers and Students for a Ride,&rdquo; made big waves for a reason. It found that up to $1 billion awarded by the U.S. Department of Education Charter Schools Program&mdash;in more than 1,000 grants&mdash;was wasted on charter schools that never opened or opened for only brief periods before being shut down for mismanagement, poor performance, lack of enrollment, and fraud.</p>\n<p>And while the report&rsquo;s major findings are eye-popping, some of the details are perhaps even more disturbing:</p>\n<ul><li>A Seattle private school that converted to a charter in order to obtain grant money only to flip back to a private school after the grant ran out a short time later, leaving ninety economically disadvantaged children scrambling to find a new school mid-year.</li> <li>Two Delaware charter schools were started by the same management firm that won multi-year grants two years apart from each other. One opened its doors but closed midyear, the second never opened at all.</li> <li>A Hawaii charter that won a grant in 2016 has yet to open, find a location, or complete the authorization process. Its <a href=\"https://www.dreamhouseewabeach.org/\">website</a> continues to say it is accepting new enrollees, but when I emailed the school to enquire how many students had enrolled, I did not receive a reply.</li> </ul>\n<p>Some of the worst financial malfeasance occurred when federal grants went to state education agencies that turned the award money over to individual charters. Here again, hundreds of the schools that received grant money never opened or opened then quickly closed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Some of the worst financial malfeasance occurred when federal grants went to state education agencies that turned the award money over to individual charters.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>In California, the state with the most charter schools, between 2004 and 2014, 306 schools that received direct or indirect federal funding closed or never opened, 111 closed within a year, and 75 never opened at all&mdash;a 39 percent failure rate. The cost to taxpayers was more than $108 million.</p>\n<p>Of the charter schools in Michigan that received federal money, at least twenty-seven never opened.

(They now total just over $22 trillion, with the annual federal deficit on course to top $1 trillion in the next few years.) &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond even consideration,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The idea that the US would not honor all of its obligations and pay them when due is something that can&rsquo;t even be considered.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Proponents of MMT think otherwise. This model suggests printing more dollars to cover US debt obligations, allowing the government to continue running with a deficit in perpetuity. (The idea relies a little on the Fed continuing to keep rates low.) Because the US borrows in US dollars, the theory goes, the deficit doesn&rsquo;t matter as much as it does for other countries.</p>\n<p>Powell had some words for that line of thought, too. &ldquo;The idea that deficits don&rsquo;t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency I think is just wrong,&rdquo; he said. Instead, politicians should be looking to &ldquo;spend less or raise more revenue.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>MMT proponents shouldn&rsquo;t be looking to the Fed to make their model work, Powell said, adding he thinks it is up to politicians to work out how to tackle an increasingly heavy debt burden&mdash;and not the central bank. &ldquo;To the extent that people are talking about using the Fed&mdash;our role is not to provide support for particular policies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Decisions about spending, and controlling spending and paying for it, are really for you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The US debt limit is set to come back into effect March 2&mdash;unless Congress introduces legislation permitting it to raise the ceiling even higher.</p>",

                "text": "Reuters/James Lawler Duggan\nTo US politicians on both sides of the aisle content to luxuriate in seemingly infinite debt, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell has a simple warning: \u201cFederal government debt is on an unsustainable path.\u201d\nSpeaking today (Feb. 26) at his semiannual congressional visit, Powell spoke out against the government\u2019s growing levels of debt, which are spiraling at a much greater rate than GDP growth.\nDefaulting on these debts\u2014as the heterodox macroeconomic theory Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) proposes\u2014is simply unthinkable, Powell said. (They now total just over $22 trillion, with the annual federal deficit on course to top $1 trillion in the next few years.) \u201cIt\u2019s beyond even consideration,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that the US would not honor all of its obligations and pay them when due is something that can\u2019t even be considered.\u201d\nProponents of MMT think otherwise. This model suggests printing more dollars to cover US debt obligations, allowing the government to continue running with a deficit in perpetuity. (The idea relies a little on the Fed continuing to keep rates low.) Because the US borrows in US dollars, the theory goes, the deficit doesn\u2019t matter as much as it does for other countries.\nPowell had some words for that line of thought, too. \u201cThe idea that deficits don\u2019t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency I think is just wrong,\u201d he said. Instead, politicians should be looking to \u201cspend less or raise more revenue.\u201d\nMMT proponents shouldn\u2019t be looking to the Fed to make their model work, Powell said, adding he thinks it is up to politicians to work out how to tackle an increasingly heavy debt burden\u2014and not the central bank. \u201cTo the extent that people are talking about using the Fed\u2014our role is not to provide support for particular policies,\u201d he said. \u201cDecisions about spending, and controlling spending and paying for it, are really for you.\u201d\nThe US debt limit is set to come back into effect March 2\u2014unless Congress introduces legislation permitting it to raise the ceiling even higher.",

For some, that&rsquo;s because of career commitments earlier in life. For others, travel and education play a role, while others are waiting until they&rsquo;ve found someone with whom they want to co-parent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/conceptionandfertilityrates/bulletins/conceptionstatistics/2017\">Stats just released</a> by the UK&rsquo;s Office for National Statistics gives one of the clearest pictures yet of these shifts. For the first time since the ONS began collecting data, more women are getting pregnant at age 30 or older than in their 20s:</p>\n<p>In 2017, the most recent year for which the agency has data, there were 398,284 pregnancies to women aged 30 or over, and 395,856 pregnancies to women of between 20 and 29. (Not all pregnancies, of course, end in childbirth.)</p>\n<p>Pregnancy in women under 20, meanwhile, fell to its lowest ever level. Kathryn Littleboy, the statistician responsible for the ONS data, said that teenage pregnancy rates, which have been falling consistently for 10 years and have more than halved since records began in 1990, may have dropped because of improved sex education, better access to contraceptives, and more young women staying in education.</p>\n<p>Total conceptions in all three of these age brackets fell, part of a trend of declining overall birthrate that keeps the UK in line with other developed economies. Only one age group saw a net rise in the rate of conception: women over 40, for whom total conceptions increased by 2.6% from the previous year. Littleboy said the reasons behind the rise in women over 40 having more children could include the effects of rising living costs.</p>\n<p>The overall trend of women getting pregnant later, however, signals a bigger shift for women, away from early marriage and motherhood, and toward establishing their careers. Fertile years don&rsquo;t last forever, which is why it makes sense to compare one decade&mdash;the 20s, when most pregnancies used to occur&mdash;to the total of both the 30s and 40s.</p>\n<p>Using the UK as a proxy for global trends, it seems likely that women entering the workplace and staying in it even when they have kids will mean a continued shift to pregnancy in the third and fourth decades of life.</p>",

For the first time since the ONS began collecting data, more women are getting pregnant at age 30 or older than in their 20s:\nIn 2017, the most recent year for which the agency has data, there were 398,284 pregnancies to women aged 30 or over, and 395,856 pregnancies to women of between 20 and 29. (Not all pregnancies, of course, end in childbirth.)\nPregnancy in women under 20, meanwhile, fell to its lowest ever level. Kathryn Littleboy, the statistician responsible for the ONS data, said that teenage pregnancy rates, which have been falling consistently for 10 years and have more than halved since records began in 1990, may have dropped because of improved sex education, better access to contraceptives, and more young women staying in education.\nTotal conceptions in all three of these age brackets fell, part of a trend of declining overall birthrate that keeps the UK in line with other developed economies. Only one age group saw a net rise in the rate of conception: women over 40, for whom total conceptions increased by 2.6% from the previous year. Littleboy said the reasons behind the rise in women over 40 having more children could include the effects of rising living costs.\nThe overall trend of women getting pregnant later, however, signals a bigger shift for women, away from early marriage and motherhood, and toward establishing their careers. Fertile years don\u2019t last forever, which is why it makes sense to compare one decade\u2014the 20s, when most pregnancies used to occur\u2014to the total of both the 30s and 40s.\nUsing the UK as a proxy for global trends, it seems likely that women entering the workplace and staying in it even when they have kids will mean a continued shift to pregnancy in the third and fourth decades of life.",

Bernie Sanders participates in a Fox News Town Hall on Monday in Bethlehem, Pa. | Mark Makela/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n<p>President Donald Trump took a second whack at Fox News on Tuesday, again expressing frustration that his favored network offered a platform for Sen. Bernie Sanders to connect with 2020 voters.</p>\n<p>Without offering evidence, Trump on Tuesday night accused Fox News of blocking his supporters from attending the previous night&rsquo;s town hall with Sanders.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Many Trump Fans &amp; Signs were outside of the @FoxNews Studio last night in the now thriving (Thank you President Trump) Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for the interview with Crazy Bernie Sanders,&rdquo; Trump wrote in a tweet. &ldquo;Big complaints about not being let in-stuffed with Bernie supporters. What&rsquo;s with @FoxNews?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Before the event, however, Fox News anchor and town hall host Martha MacCallum with The Morning Call about the event, including how the audience was picked. The Pennsylvania paper reported, &ldquo;Fox reached out to various political and local groups in the area and mined requests to attend after it publicly announced the event. Fox said &lsquo;hundreds&rsquo; of people are on the waiting list.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sanders&rsquo; screen time on the typically Trump-friendly Fox News on Monday night was a success by most measures, drawing the highest ratings for a town hall in the 2020 election cycle and allowing Sanders the opportunity to face questioning from more skeptical voters. The town hall was hosted in the portion of Bethlehem, Pa., that voted twice for former President Barack Obama before flipping to Trump in 2016.</p>\n<p>One viral moment of the town hall came when hosts Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier polled the audience on Sanders&rsquo; Medicare for All plan &mdash; a proposition frequently scrutinized on the network &mdash; to resounding approval.</p>\n<p>Trump, whose ties to and affinity for Fox News are well documented, tweeted earlier Tuesday that it was &ldquo;so weird&rdquo; to watch Sanders on the network, complaining that Baier and the audience were &ldquo;so smiley and nice.&rdquo; He also questioned the network&rsquo;s hiring of former Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile as a commentator.</p>\n<p>But while the president is a frequent guest on the network, he tends to stick to interviews with friendlier personalities like prime-time opinion programming hosts Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, or the network's &ldquo;Fox &amp; Friends&rdquo; morning show, where he receives almost unflinchingly positive coverage.</p>\n<p>Baier, in a tweet, hinted at the president&rsquo;s reluctance to interview with the channel&rsquo;s news anchors, replying to Trump and saying, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to have you on a town hall soon &mdash; or even an interview on @SpecialReport &mdash;it&rsquo;s been awhile. We cover all sides.&rdquo;</p>",

Bernie Sanders to connect with 2020 voters.\nWithout offering evidence, Trump on Tuesday night accused Fox News of blocking his supporters from attending the previous night\u2019s town hall with Sanders.\n\u201cMany Trump Fans & Signs were outside of the @FoxNews Studio last night in the now thriving (Thank you President Trump) Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for the interview with Crazy Bernie Sanders,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. \u201cBig complaints about not being let in-stuffed with Bernie supporters. What\u2019s with @FoxNews?\u201d\nBefore the event, however, Fox News anchor and town hall host Martha MacCallum with The Morning Call about the event, including how the audience was picked. The Pennsylvania paper reported, \u201cFox reached out to various political and local groups in the area and mined requests to attend after it publicly announced the event. Fox said \u2018hundreds\u2019 of people are on the waiting list.\u201d\nSanders\u2019 screen time on the typically Trump-friendly Fox News on Monday night was a success by most measures, drawing the highest ratings for a town hall in the 2020 election cycle and allowing Sanders the opportunity to face questioning from more skeptical voters. The town hall was hosted in the portion of Bethlehem, Pa., that voted twice for former President Barack Obama before flipping to Trump in 2016.\nOne viral moment of the town hall came when hosts Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier polled the audience on Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan \u2014 a proposition frequently scrutinized on the network \u2014 to resounding approval.\nTrump, whose ties to and affinity for Fox News are well documented, tweeted earlier Tuesday that it was \u201cso weird\u201d to watch Sanders on the network, complaining that Baier and the audience were \u201cso smiley and nice.\u201d He also questioned the network\u2019s hiring of former Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile as a commentator.\nBut while the president is a frequent guest on the network, he tends to stick to interviews with friendlier personalities like prime-time opinion programming hosts Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, or the network's \u201cFox & Friends\u201d morning show, where he receives almost unflinchingly positive coverage.\nBaier, in a tweet, hinted at the president\u2019s reluctance to interview with the channel\u2019s news anchors, replying to Trump and saying, \u201cWe\u2019d love to have you on a town hall soon \u2014 or even an interview on @SpecialReport \u2014it\u2019s been awhile. We cover all sides.\u201d",

He told the judge he wants to protect their privacy. Martin, in her order, also has blocked all media from court proceedings in the case.</p>\n<aside> <h3>Dive Deeper Into Our Reporting</h3> <p>Our newsletter is written by a ProPublica Illinois reporter every week</p>  </aside>\n<p>At a hearing Friday, a day after Martin issued her order, Gabriel Fuentes, an attorney at Jenner &amp; Block representing ProPublica Illinois, said that every day Martin&rsquo;s order is in place represents a &ldquo;constitutional injury&rdquo; to the news organization. He said restraining the press is &ldquo;one of the highest bars in national law.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>ProPublica Illinois reporters learned the identities of the children and foster parents independent of and before the court proceedings, which they told the judge in the case at a March 7 hearing.</p>\n<p>Fuentes argued Friday that ProPublica Illinois should be allowed to intervene &mdash; essentially to join the case &mdash; so the news organization could argue why it shouldn&rsquo;t be prevented from publishing.</p>\n<p>Boyer told the judge he was concerned that allowing ProPublica Illinois to intervene would grant the news organization access to information that should remain confidential. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how ProPublica can meaningfully participate in the merits of the order without getting access&rdquo; to the confidential information, he said in court.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are not saying ProPublica cannot write about this case,&rdquo; Boyer said. &ldquo;We are focused on protecting the identifications of the minors.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Attorneys from the Cook County public defender&rsquo;s office representing the birth mother of the minors did not object to ProPublica Illinois joining the case, while a lawyer for the father wasn&rsquo;t present for the Friday hearing but told other lawyers in the case that she also did not object. Attorneys for the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services asked for additional time to study ProPublica Illinois&rsquo; motion.</p>\n<p>Martin said Friday she would allow ProPublica Illinois to intervene on the issue of prior restraint after she reviewed transcripts of the March 7 hearing. An order had not been issued as of Monday afternoon.</p>\n<p>The rest of the juvenile case files would be off-limits, she said.</p>",

He told the judge he wants to protect their privacy. Martin, in her order, also has blocked all media from court proceedings in the case.\nDive Deeper Into Our Reporting\nOur newsletter is written by a ProPublica Illinois reporter every week\nAt a hearing Friday, a day after Martin issued her order, Gabriel Fuentes, an attorney at Jenner & Block representing ProPublica Illinois, said that every day Martin\u2019s order is in place represents a \u201cconstitutional injury\u201d to the news organization. He said restraining the press is \u201cone of the highest bars in national law.\u201d\nProPublica Illinois reporters learned the identities of the children and foster parents independent of and before the court proceedings, which they told the judge in the case at a March 7 hearing.\nFuentes argued Friday that ProPublica Illinois should be allowed to intervene \u2014 essentially to join the case \u2014 so the news organization could argue why it shouldn\u2019t be prevented from publishing.\nBoyer told the judge he was concerned that allowing ProPublica Illinois to intervene would grant the news organization access to information that should remain confidential. \u201cI don\u2019t know how ProPublica can meaningfully participate in the merits of the order without getting access\u201d to the confidential information, he said in court.\n\u201cWe are not saying ProPublica cannot write about this case,\u201d Boyer said. \u201cWe are focused on protecting the identifications of the minors.\u201d\nAttorneys from the Cook County public defender\u2019s office representing the birth mother of the minors did not object to ProPublica Illinois joining the case, while a lawyer for the father wasn\u2019t present for the Friday hearing but told other lawyers in the case that she also did not object. Attorneys for the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services asked for additional time to study ProPublica Illinois\u2019 motion.\nMartin said Friday she would allow ProPublica Illinois to intervene on the issue of prior restraint after she reviewed transcripts of the March 7 hearing. An order had not been issued as of Monday afternoon.\nThe rest of the juvenile case files would be off-limits, she said.",

It is illegal for housing, job and credit advertisers to discriminate against protected groups.</p>\n<p>ProPublica had been able to buy housing-related ads on Facebook that excluded groups such as <a href=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/20171121-facebook-retry-what-we-chose.jpg\">African Americans</a> and <a href=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/20171121-facebook-judaism.jpg\">Jews</a>, and it previously found job ads excluding users by <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads\">age</a> and <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-is-letting-job-advertisers-target-only-men\">gender</a> placed by companies that are household names, like Uber and Verizon Wireless.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This settlement is a shot across the bow to all tech companies and platforms,&rdquo; said Peter Romer-Friedman, a lawyer with Outten &amp; Golden in Washington who represented the plaintiffs along with the ACLU. &ldquo;They need to understand that civil rights apply to the internet, and it&rsquo;s not a civil rights-free zone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The changes apply to advertisers who offer housing, employment and credit offers to U.S.-based users of Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. Facebook said it hopes to implement the requirements by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/summary-settlements-between-civil-rights-advocates-and-facebook\">agreement</a> also will create a separate online portal for housing, credit and employment offers. Those advertisers will not be able to target users in a geographic area smaller than a 15-mile radius, which advocates say tamps down on &ldquo;digital&rdquo; neighborhood redlining.</p>\n<p>Housing, job and credit advertisers will also now only be able to choose from a few hundred interest categories to target consumers, down from several thousand. Critics have said such a swath of finely tuned categories, like <a href=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/20171121-facebook-ability.jpg\">people interested in wheelchair ramps</a>, are essentially proxies to find and exclude certain groups. Facebook said it will keep more generic interests like &ldquo;real estate,&rdquo; &ldquo;apartment&rdquo; and &ldquo;job interview.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Facebook also said it will create a page where users can see all current housing ads whether or not the users were among those targeted. The agreement says Facebook will also study how algorithms can be biased.</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"4\"><figure><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20170914-facebook-target-ads-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20170914-facebook-target-ads-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20170914-facebook-target-ads-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20170914-facebook-target-ads-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters\">Facebook Enabled Advertisers to Reach &lsquo;Jew Haters&rsquo;</a></figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>&ldquo;There is a long history of discrimination in the areas of housing, employment and credit, and this harmful behavior should not happen through Facebook ads,&rdquo; Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote in a statement Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The changes are part of Facebook&rsquo;s settlement in five discrimination lawsuits. Plaintiffs included the Communications Workers of America and several fair-housing organizations, as well as individual consumers and job seekers. The settlement includes a payout of about $5 million to plaintiffs, mostly to defray legal costs.</p>\n<p>The company agreed last year to limit advertisers&rsquo; ability to target by <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-promises-to-bar-advertisers-from-targeting-ads-by-race-or-ethnicity-again\">some demographic categories</a>, following a complaint by Washington state.</p>\n<p>Facebook has previously said that it was being held to an unreasonably high standard, and that ads excluding users by age and gender were not discriminatory. &ldquo;We completely reject the allegation that these advertisements are discriminatory,&rdquo; Vice President of Ads Rob Goldman wrote in a December 2017 post. &ldquo;Used responsibly, age-based targeting for employment purposes is an accepted industry practice and for good reason: it helps employers recruit and people of all ages find work.&rdquo; The post was titled: &ldquo;<a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/h/addressing-targeting-in-recruitment-ads/\">This Time, ProPublica, We Disagree</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Facebook said Tuesday it had &ldquo;not seen the kind of explicit discriminatory behavior that civil rights groups are concerned about.&rdquo; But ProPublica used a crowdsourcing project to find dozens examples of job ads that excluded <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads\">workers over 40</a>, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-is-letting-job-advertisers-target-only-men\">women</a> and other protected groups.</p>\n<p>Facebook has made another move recently that resulted in less transparency around ads. This year, it <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-blocks-ad-transparency-tools\">moved to block a ProPublica project</a> that allowed the public to see how political ads are being targeted on Facebook.</p>\n<p>The company said it was simply enforcing its terms of service.</p>",

Sign up for ProPublica's Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published.\nFacebook advertisers can no longer target users by age, gender and ZIP code for housing, employment and credit offers, the company announced Tuesday as part of a major settlement with civil rights organizations.\nThe wide-ranging agreement follows reporting by ProPublica since 2016 that found Facebook let advertisers exclude users by race and other categories that are protected by federal law. It is illegal for housing, job and credit advertisers to discriminate against protected groups.\nProPublica had been able to buy housing-related ads on Facebook that excluded groups such as African Americans and Jews, and it previously found job ads excluding users by age and gender placed by companies that are household names, like Uber and Verizon Wireless.\n\u201cThis settlement is a shot across the bow to all tech companies and platforms,\u201d said Peter Romer-Friedman, a lawyer with Outten & Golden in Washington who represented the plaintiffs along with the ACLU. \u201cThey need to understand that civil rights apply to the internet, and it\u2019s not a civil rights-free zone.\u201d\nThe changes apply to advertisers who offer housing, employment and credit offers to U.S.-based users of Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. Facebook said it hopes to implement the requirements by the end of the year.\nThe agreement also will create a separate online portal for housing, credit and employment offers. Those advertisers will not be able to target users in a geographic area smaller than a 15-mile radius, which advocates say tamps down on \u201cdigital\u201d neighborhood redlining.\nHousing, job and credit advertisers will also now only be able to choose from a few hundred interest categories to target consumers, down from several thousand. Critics have said such a swath of finely tuned categories, like people interested in wheelchair ramps, are essentially proxies to find and exclude certain groups. Facebook said it will keep more generic interests like \u201creal estate,\u201d \u201capartment\u201d and \u201cjob interview.\u201d\nFacebook also said it will create a page where users can see all current housing ads whether or not the users were among those targeted. The agreement says Facebook will also study how algorithms can be biased.\n\u201cThere is a long history of discrimination in the areas of housing, employment and credit, and this harmful behavior should not happen through Facebook ads,\u201d Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote in a statement Tuesday.\nThe changes are part of Facebook\u2019s settlement in five discrimination lawsuits. Plaintiffs included the Communications Workers of America and several fair-housing organizations, as well as individual consumers and job seekers. The settlement includes a payout of about $5 million to plaintiffs, mostly to defray legal costs.\nThe company agreed last year to limit advertisers\u2019 ability to target by some demographic categories, following a complaint by Washington state.\nFacebook has previously said that it was being held to an unreasonably high standard, and that ads excluding users by age and gender were not discriminatory. \u201cWe completely reject the allegation that these advertisements are discriminatory,\u201d Vice President of Ads Rob Goldman wrote in a December 2017 post. \u201cUsed responsibly, age-based targeting for employment purposes is an accepted industry practice and for good reason: it helps employers recruit and people of all ages find work.\u201d The post was titled: \u201cThis Time, ProPublica, We Disagree.\u201d\nFacebook said Tuesday it had \u201cnot seen the kind of explicit discriminatory behavior that civil rights groups are concerned about.\u201d But ProPublica used a crowdsourcing project to find dozens examples of job ads that excluded workers over 40, women and other protected groups.\nFacebook has made another move recently that resulted in less transparency around ads. This year, it moved to block a ProPublica project that allowed the public to see how political ads are being targeted on Facebook.\nThe company said it was simply enforcing its terms of service.",

The GAO&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-19-249\">report</a>, which was released Friday, noted that ProPublica&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/trump-town/\">Trump Town</a> is the only place people can access much of this information.</p>\n<p>The report portrayed such information as crucial to holding appointees to high standards. &ldquo;Strong ethics programs are critical to ensuring public trust in government and the integrity of actions taken on the public&rsquo;s behalf,&rdquo; it states. &ldquo;Political appointees, in particular agency heads, have a personal responsibility to exercise leadership in ethics. &hellip; [M]embers of the public need access to information on who is serving in political appointee positions. Otherwise, they are limited in their ability to discern whether appointees are performing their duties free of conflict.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Neither federal agencies nor the White House are required to publicly post full, up-to-date listings of political appointees or senior government officials, many of whom don&rsquo;t face confirmation or public hearings by the Senate. &ldquo;In the absence of comprehensive and timely data on political appointees serving in the executive branch, two nongovernmental organizations &mdash; the Partnership for Public Service and ProPublica &mdash; stated that they collect and report some data themselves,&rdquo; the report notes.</p>\n<p>The report states that ProPublica&rsquo;s Trump Town tracks all types of federal political appointees but &ldquo;one limitation is that they rely on agency responses to FOIA requests and therefore the data may not be comprehensive or timely.&rdquo; ProPublica staffers (including the author of this article) were interviewed by the GAO in 2018. The report goes on to say:</p>\n<blockquote> <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"3.2\">Making such information available would promote transparency. The public, including independent researchers, the media, and nongovernmental organizations, can use these data to perform independent analyses to identify gaps and challenges for filling political appointee positions or to identify potential conflicts of interest. Such analyses would also facilitate congressional oversight of executive branch appointees by providing a comprehensive and timely source of information on political appointees.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>The GAO recommended Congress consider legislation that would require the &ldquo;comprehensive and timely information on political appointees serving in the Executive Branch to be collected and made publicly accessible.&rdquo; The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is now considering the GAO recommendation.</p>\n<p>The GAO said the federal government&rsquo;s human resources department, the Office of Personnel Management, is &ldquo;positioned to collect, maintain, and make political appointee data publicly available on a frequent and recurring basis.&rdquo; But it also said the OPM is &ldquo;limited in its ability to provide comprehensive data, in part because it does not regularly receive data from each agency that has political appointees.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The OPM did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"4\">  <figure><a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/trump-town/\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 335px, (min-width: 960px) calc(18.38vw + 23px), (min-width: 780px) 18.75vw, (min-width: 600px) 27.5vw, 43.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo1200w/20180307-trump-town-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo400w/20180307-trump-town-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo800w/20180307-trump-town-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo1200w/20180307-trump-town-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a></figure> </aside>\n<p>Elsewhere in the report, the GAO found several instances of lapses and delays in filing required ethics and financial disclosure records by political appointees at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of the Interior and the Small Business Administration. In response to the report, the lawmakers who requested the GAO review &mdash; Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/minority-media/sens-peters-and-carper-and-rep-cummings-announce-gao-report-outlining-serious-compliance-issues-with-agency-and-white-house-ethics-programs\">criticized those federal agencies</a> as well as the White House, which ignored GAO&rsquo;s requests for information and interviews.</p>\n<p>Launched in March 2018, Trump Town is a searchable database of 3,232 current and former Trump administration political appointees, including their jobs and offices, employment history, lobbying records, government ethics documents, financial disclosures and, in some cases, resumes. ProPublica routinely requests staffing lists and other information through the Freedom of Information Act and the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ourpublicservice.org/\">The Partnership for Public Service</a>, founded in 2001 as a nonpartisan nonprofit that advises federal agencies during the presidential transition process, among other things, started publicly tracking political appointees who were subject to Senate confirmation in December 2016. &ldquo;The basic insight of the GAO report is that you can&rsquo;t truly have an accountable government if you don&rsquo;t know who runs the government in real time,&rdquo; said Max Stier, the partnership&rsquo;s president and CEO.</p>\n<p>The limitations in accessing government staffing data are partially by design. In 2012, a group of former federal officials in law enforcement, diplomatic and national security positions <a href=\"http://cdn.govexec.com/media/gbc/docs/pdfs_edit/091812kl1.pdf\">wrote to congressional leaders</a>, saying a searchable list would &ldquo;create significant threats to the national security and to the personal safety and financial security of the executive branch officials and their families, especially career employees.&rdquo; The letter also called complete personal financial information of all senior officials on the internet a &ldquo;jackpot for enemies of the United States intent on finding security vulnerabilities they can exploit.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The GAO report did not address this assertion, but it implied such circumstances are a long way off: &ldquo;Until the names of political appointees and their position, position type, agency or department name, start and end dates are publicly available at least quarterly, it will be difficult for the public to access comprehensive and reliable information.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"6\">   <figure><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-lobbying-swamp-is-flourishing-in-trumps-washington\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 335px, (min-width: 960px) calc(18.38vw + 23px), (min-width: 780px) 18.75vw, (min-width: 600px) 27.5vw, 43.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20190214-lobbying-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190214-lobbying-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190214-lobbying-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20190214-lobbying-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a></figure>    </aside>\n<p><strong>Filed under:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/topics/trump-administration\">Trump Administration</a></li> </ul>",

                "text": "The Government Accountability Office, the congressional watchdog agency, is urging the federal government to make information about thousands of political appointees \u2014 including their names, titles and federal salary disclosures about their assets, debts and past salaries \u2014 publicly available. The GAO\u2019s report, which was released Friday, noted that ProPublica\u2019s Trump Town is the only place people can access much of this information.\nThe report portrayed such information as crucial to holding appointees to high standards. \u201cStrong ethics programs are critical to ensuring public trust in government and the integrity of actions taken on the public\u2019s behalf,\u201d it states. \u201cPolitical appointees, in particular agency heads, have a personal responsibility to exercise leadership in ethics. \u2026 [M]embers of the public need access to information on who is serving in political appointee positions. Otherwise, they are limited in their ability to discern whether appointees are performing their duties free of conflict.\u201d\nNeither federal agencies nor the White House are required to publicly post full, up-to-date listings of political appointees or senior government officials, many of whom don\u2019t face confirmation or public hearings by the Senate. \u201cIn the absence of comprehensive and timely data on political appointees serving in the executive branch, two nongovernmental organizations \u2014 the Partnership for Public Service and ProPublica \u2014 stated that they collect and report some data themselves,\u201d the report notes.\nThe report states that ProPublica\u2019s Trump Town tracks all types of federal political appointees but \u201cone limitation is that they rely on agency responses to FOIA requests and therefore the data may not be comprehensive or timely.\u201d ProPublica staffers (including the author of this article) were interviewed by the GAO in 2018. The report goes on to say:\nMaking such information available would promote transparency. The public, including independent researchers, the media, and nongovernmental organizations, can use these data to perform independent analyses to identify gaps and challenges for filling political appointee positions or to identify potential conflicts of interest. Such analyses would also facilitate congressional oversight of executive branch appointees by providing a comprehensive and timely source of information on political appointees.\nThe GAO recommended Congress consider legislation that would require the \u201ccomprehensive and timely information on political appointees serving in the Executive Branch to be collected and made publicly accessible.\u201d The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is now considering the GAO recommendation.\nThe GAO said the federal government\u2019s human resources department, the Office of Personnel Management, is \u201cpositioned to collect, maintain, and make political appointee data publicly available on a frequent and recurring basis.\u201d But it also said the OPM is \u201climited in its ability to provide comprehensive data, in part because it does not regularly receive data from each agency that has political appointees.\u201d\nThe OPM did not respond to requests for comment.\nElsewhere in the report, the GAO found several instances of lapses and delays in filing required ethics and financial disclosure records by political appointees at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of the Interior and the Small Business Administration. In response to the report, the lawmakers who requested the GAO review \u2014 Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee \u2014 criticized those federal agencies as well as the White House, which ignored GAO\u2019s requests for information and interviews.\nLaunched in March 2018, Trump Town is a searchable database of 3,232 current and former Trump administration political appointees, including their jobs and offices, employment history, lobbying records, government ethics documents, financial disclosures and, in some cases, resumes. ProPublica routinely requests staffing lists and other information through the Freedom of Information Act and the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.\nThe Partnership for Public Service, founded in 2001 as a nonpartisan nonprofit that advises federal agencies during the presidential transition process, among other things, started publicly tracking political appointees who were subject to Senate confirmation in December 2016. \u201cThe basic insight of the GAO report is that you can\u2019t truly have an accountable government if you don\u2019t know who runs the government in real time,\u201d said Max Stier, the partnership\u2019s president and CEO.\nThe limitations in accessing government staffing data are partially by design. In 2012, a group of former federal officials in law enforcement, diplomatic and national security positions wrote to congressional leaders, saying a searchable list would \u201ccreate significant threats to the national security and to the personal safety and financial security of the executive branch officials and their families, especially career employees.\u201d The letter also called complete personal financial information of all senior officials on the internet a \u201cjackpot for enemies of the United States intent on finding security vulnerabilities they can exploit.\u201d\nThe GAO report did not address this assertion, but it implied such circumstances are a long way off: \u201cUntil the names of political appointees and their position, position type, agency or department name, start and end dates are publicly available at least quarterly, it will be difficult for the public to access comprehensive and reliable information.\u201d\nFiled under:\nTrump Administration",

The day Berry got out, officials unceremoniously dropped him off at 6 a.m. in the downtown of a city he hadn&rsquo;t seen in more than two decades. He ended up wandering down now-unfamiliar streets to his grandmother&rsquo;s house.</p>\n<p>As Herndon dove into his case, she was shocked by the dogmatic nature of a criminal justice system that refused to release Berry, or even hear his case, for years after someone else confessed to the murder.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was disappointing to find out the system would royally mess up in the first place,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but then not to be able to self-correct once the problem is brought up was really disheartening to see.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Fired up, she went into Pickering&rsquo;s office to talk about what she&rsquo;d learned. Pickering, who had written one of the key opinions in the Berry case, encouraged her to keep going and look into how Nevada handled wrongful convictions. Herndon said she discovered that not only did Nevada fail to compensate exonerees, it was &ldquo;really, really behind in its legislation&rdquo; to prevent cases like Berry&rsquo;s from happening again.</p>\n<p>She said she began to think that maybe she could play a role in helping to craft new legislation to help remedy that. As Herndon became more devoted to pursuing the issue, Pickering told her that she should ask her dad about Steese.</p>\n<p>Herndon, who didn&rsquo;t know much about the case, said she was puzzled by Pickering&rsquo;s suggestion. &ldquo;I thought, &lsquo;OK, that&rsquo;s vague.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The next morning, while Herndon and her dad made the 30-minute commute from their home to the courthouse in downtown Las Vegas, she broached the topic of Steese.</p>\n<p>As he watched his daughter dive into wrongful convictions that summer, Doug Herndon said he knew she&rsquo;d eventually come around to Steese &mdash; and his role in Steese&rsquo;s case. In 1995, he and another assistant district attorney, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/vegas-judge-featured-in-propublica-story-reprimanded-for-ethics-violations\">William Kephart</a>, prosecuted Steese, a poorly educated drifter, for the brutal murder of a circus performer. The often-convoluted case was riddled with troubling behavior by the prosecution, which was later detailed in ProPublica&rsquo;s investigation. In 2012, after more than 20 years in prison, Steese was exonerated when a judge declared him innocent. Evidence found in the prosecution&rsquo;s files showed he&rsquo;d been several states away when the murder happened.</p>\n<p>Kaitlyn Herndon said she wasn&rsquo;t sure what she was in for when she brought up Steese, and when her dad turned serious, she remembered feeling a little nervous.</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"4\">   <figure><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/alford-pleas-fred-steese-conviction-without-admitting-guilt\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/_threeTwo400w/20170525-alford-pleas-3x2.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/alford-pleas-fred-steese-conviction-without-admitting-guilt\">Kafka in Vegas</a></figcaption></figure>    <p>Fred Steese served more than 20 years in prison for the murder of a Vegas showman even though evidence in the prosecution&rsquo;s files proved he didn&rsquo;t do it. But when the truth came to light, he was offered a confounding deal known as an Alford plea. If he took it he could go free, but he&rsquo;d remain a convicted killer.</p>   </aside>\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s really smart and bright and I know she loves me,&rdquo; Doug Herndon said in an interview. But, he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s never an easy conversation to say, &lsquo;I had involvement in a case where a defendant went to trial and was found guilty, went to prison and then was found factually innocent.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As she listened to her dad discuss the details of the case, Kaitlyn Herndon said she &ldquo;was watching for signs for remorse and worry about it. During our entire conversation he was very apologetic for the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Doug Herndon recalled being worried his daughter would think the worst of him. He said he told her &ldquo;errors were made and those were bad. But please believe me, I&rsquo;m not a horrible person.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Herndon, now a judge overseeing the operation of the criminal division of the Eighth Judicial District Court in Las Vegas, said it was crucial to him that his daughter understood that &ldquo;I accept my responsibility for everything.&rdquo; No matter the circumstances, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s important is that a guy who was innocent got convicted.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For Kaitlyn Herndon, it was a relief that the man she grew up watching in the courtroom lived up to the vision of him she&rsquo;d always held. &ldquo;I would have been very disappointed if he was more defensive, and that&rsquo;s not the conversation we had, I&rsquo;m happy to say.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The attitude of her father &mdash; who admittedly had his own struggles over the years accepting Steese&rsquo;s innocence &mdash; was part of what she wanted to see enshrined in legislation to help the wrongfully convicted. She pushed for exonerees to be cleared of all blame, to have their records sealed and have something official that noted their innocence.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Recognizing the fault and taking ownership of it &mdash; that&rsquo;s extremely overlooked,&rdquo; she said, noting that Berry hadn&rsquo;t received an official apology until last month.</p>\n<p>In the weeks after the conversation with her dad, Kaitlyn Herndon wrote a reparations proposal for the Legislature&rsquo;s consideration. She asked her dad how best to navigate the politics of this kind of bill when deciding how far to take it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You ask for everything,&rdquo; Doug Herndon said he told her. &ldquo;Everybody found factually innocent should be compensated in some fashion.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With about a month left before she&rsquo;d need to return to Washington University in St. Louis, Kaitlyn Herndon nervously gathered several key stakeholders to get them on board and hash out any sticky issues.</p>\n<p>Assemblyman Steve Yeager, a former public defender who had been thinking about the need for this type of legislation for years, agreed to spearhead the bill. He composed and sponsored the legislation.</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"6\">   <figure><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/what-does-an-innocent-man-have-to-do-alford-plea-guilty\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 335px, (min-width: 960px) calc(18.38vw + 23px), (min-width: 780px) 18.75vw, (min-width: 600px) 27.5vw, 43.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20170907-owens-lead-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20170907-owens-lead-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20170907-owens-lead-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20170907-owens-lead-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/what-does-an-innocent-man-have-to-do-alford-plea-guilty\">What Does an Innocent Man Have to Do to Go Free? Plead Guilty.</a></figcaption></figure>    </aside>\n<p>In March, Kaitlyn Herndon flew back from school to help campaign for its passage and testify at a hearing on the bill before the Assembly Judiciary Committee, which Yeager heads. Berry&rsquo;s testimony had the room in tears. Even with the family connection to Steese, Herndon said it had been easy to &ldquo;feel very distant when it&rsquo;s all numbers, statutes and bullet points, as it really was for many months. But to finally meet [Berry and his wife] in person and to joke and chat with them was one of the most important experiences in my life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This month, the judiciary committee unanimously passed the resulting bill and it will soon go to the Assembly floor, where it has broad bipartisan support. Then it will head to the Senate, where it also has wide support. As written, the legislation would award exonerees more money the longer they spent behind bars. For those wrongfully imprisoned for one to 10 years, the payout would be $50,000 for each year. The amount would rise to $75,000 per year for exonerees who serve 11 to 17 years and to $85,000 for 18 to 20 years. For those imprisoned for more than 20 years, like Berry and Steese, the payout per year is $100,000. The bill also provides other resources, such as tuition assistance and counseling.</p>\n<p>Kaitlyn Herndon said she had zeroed in on legislation on the books in Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Hawaii and Ohio as inspiration.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;States that were pushing not only monetary compensation but actual services to get people to a place to be more situated to be in the world,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>The compensation given in other places ranges from flat amounts as small as $20,000 to rising scales. Yeager said he blended what was done elsewhere and liked the idea of recognizing that more time locked away should be worth more money.</p>\n<p>Both Steese, now 55, and Berry could be entitled to more than $2 million if the bill passes.</p>\n<p>Ironically, given Doug Herndon&rsquo;s regret, if the Nevada District Attorneys Association has its way, Steese would be written out of the bill.</p>\n<p>Steese had an unusual path to exoneration. Despite a judge&rsquo;s ruling that Steese was actually innocent, the Clark County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office refused to concede that it had convicted the wrong man. Instead, the new assigned prosecutor said she would fight to keep Steese behind bars, appealing or retrying him for the murder. Fearing a system that had already wrongfully convicted him once, Steese agreed in 2013 to a confounding deal called an Alford plea, which allowed him to maintain his innocence while still pleading guilty. In exchange, the state let him go.</p>\n<p>But in the eyes of the law, he remained a convicted murderer. Only <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/fred-steese-nevada-pardons-wrongfully-convicted-man-featured-in-our-story\">an eventual pardon</a> four years later &mdash; which the Clark County District Attorney fought &mdash; cleared his name. All but one of the members of the pardon commission, which includes the governor, voted to grant Steese a full pardon. &ldquo;Let there be no residual stain on his record,&rdquo; one of the commission members said at the time.</p>\n<p>The bill as currently written includes a special acknowledgement of cases like Steese&rsquo;s, noting that compensation will be awarded if &ldquo;the person was pardoned by the State Board of Pardons Commissioners on the grounds that the person was innocent.&rdquo; The DA association has proposed striking that provision.</p>\n<p>As far as Steese&rsquo;s civil lawyer Lisa Rasmussen knows, he&rsquo;s the only one in the state of Nevada to be pardoned based on actual innocence. Leaving him out, &ldquo;would do nothing more than perpetuate a cruelty upon him,&rdquo; she said. It&rsquo;s time for Nevada to compensate the wrongfully convicted like other states have done, she said, &ldquo;and Fred is included in that category of unfortunate people.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"10\">   <figure><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/fred-steese-nevada-pardons-wrongfully-convicted-man-featured-in-our-story\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 335px, (min-width: 960px) calc(18.38vw + 23px), (min-width: 780px) 18.75vw, (min-width: 600px) 27.5vw, 43.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20171109-fred-steese-lead-new-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171109-fred-steese-lead-new-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171109-fred-steese-lead-new-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20171109-fred-steese-lead-new-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/fred-steese-nevada-pardons-wrongfully-convicted-man-featured-in-our-story\">Nevada Pardons Wrongfully Convicted Man Featured in Our Story</a></figcaption></figure>    </aside>\n<p>Jennifer Noble, a prosecutor with Washoe County and an officer with the DA association, said the association supports the intent of the bill, but not the language. The association wants the burden of proof for innocence to be stricter in order to qualify.</p>\n<p>So far, lawmakers have declined to alter the bill to reflect the association&rsquo;s changes or to exclude cases like Steese&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To somehow bar [Steese] from recovery under the statute would be really unjust,&rdquo; Yeager said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to me to have that avenue available.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Steese, now a long-haul trucker based in California, said he thought the bill was overdue. &ldquo;They took 21 years of my life.

                "text": "If all goes as expected, this summer, the governor of Nevada will sign a bill that will compensate men and women wrongfully convicted in the state for the years they spent behind bars and grant them certificates of innocence.\nInspired by recent high-profile exonerations \u2014 including that of Fred Steese, whose case was detailed in 2017 by ProPublica and Vanity Fair \u2014 the groundbreaking bill will bring Nevada in line with 33 other states that now compensate exonerees.\nBut it\u2019s the story behind the bill that\u2019s the real showstopper.\nIt involves a nudge from a state Supreme Court justice, an impassioned college student outraged by the fate of the state\u2019s exonerees and finally her dad, a district judge, who was one of the prosecutors involved in the wrongful conviction of Steese more than two decades earlier.\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\nLast summer, Kaitlyn Herndon, a rising junior and aspiring lawyer, had just started her second school break working for Nevada Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Kristina Pickering when the judge encouraged her to look into the case of DeMarlo Berry.\nBerry, 42, had been in the headlines the previous year when he was released from prison after serving 23 years for a murder he didn\u2019t commit. The day Berry got out, officials unceremoniously dropped him off at 6 a.m. in the downtown of a city he hadn\u2019t seen in more than two decades. He ended up wandering down now-unfamiliar streets to his grandmother\u2019s house.\nAs Herndon dove into his case, she was shocked by the dogmatic nature of a criminal justice system that refused to release Berry, or even hear his case, for years after someone else confessed to the murder.\n\u201cIt was disappointing to find out the system would royally mess up in the first place,\u201d she said, \u201cbut then not to be able to self-correct once the problem is brought up was really disheartening to see.\u201d\nFired up, she went into Pickering\u2019s office to talk about what she\u2019d learned. Pickering, who had written one of the key opinions in the Berry case, encouraged her to keep going and look into how Nevada handled wrongful convictions. Herndon said she discovered that not only did Nevada fail to compensate exonerees, it was \u201creally, really behind in its legislation\u201d to prevent cases like Berry\u2019s from happening again.\nShe said she began to think that maybe she could play a role in helping to craft new legislation to help remedy that. As Herndon became more devoted to pursuing the issue, Pickering told her that she should ask her dad about Steese.\nHerndon, who didn\u2019t know much about the case, said she was puzzled by Pickering\u2019s suggestion. \u201cI thought, \u2018OK, that\u2019s vague.\u2019\u201d\nThe next morning, while Herndon and her dad made the 30-minute commute from their home to the courthouse in downtown Las Vegas, she broached the topic of Steese.\nAs he watched his daughter dive into wrongful convictions that summer, Doug Herndon said he knew she\u2019d eventually come around to Steese \u2014 and his role in Steese\u2019s case. In 1995, he and another assistant district attorney, William Kephart, prosecuted Steese, a poorly educated drifter, for the brutal murder of a circus performer. The often-convoluted case was riddled with troubling behavior by the prosecution, which was later detailed in ProPublica\u2019s investigation. In 2012, after more than 20 years in prison, Steese was exonerated when a judge declared him innocent. Evidence found in the prosecution\u2019s files showed he\u2019d been several states away when the murder happened.\nKaitlyn Herndon said she wasn\u2019t sure what she was in for when she brought up Steese, and when her dad turned serious, she remembered feeling a little nervous.\nFred Steese served more than 20 years in prison for the murder of a Vegas showman even though evidence in the prosecution\u2019s files proved he didn\u2019t do it. But when the truth came to light, he was offered a confounding deal known as an Alford plea. If he took it he could go free, but he\u2019d remain a convicted killer.\n\u201cShe\u2019s really smart and bright and I know she loves me,\u201d Doug Herndon said in an interview. But, he said, \u201cit\u2019s never an easy conversation to say, \u2018I had involvement in a case where a defendant went to trial and was found guilty, went to prison and then was found factually innocent.\u2019\u201d\nAs she listened to her dad discuss the details of the case, Kaitlyn Herndon said she \u201cwas watching for signs for remorse and worry about it. During our entire conversation he was very apologetic for the whole thing.\u201d\nDoug Herndon recalled being worried his daughter would think the worst of him. He said he told her \u201cerrors were made and those were bad. But please believe me, I\u2019m not a horrible person.\u201d\nHerndon, now a judge overseeing the operation of the criminal division of the Eighth Judicial District Court in Las Vegas, said it was crucial to him that his daughter understood that \u201cI accept my responsibility for everything.\u201d No matter the circumstances, \u201cwhat\u2019s important is that a guy who was innocent got convicted.\u201d\nFor Kaitlyn Herndon, it was a relief that the man she grew up watching in the courtroom lived up to the vision of him she\u2019d always held. \u201cI would have been very disappointed if he was more defensive, and that\u2019s not the conversation we had, I\u2019m happy to say.\u201d\nThe attitude of her father \u2014 who admittedly had his own struggles over the years accepting Steese\u2019s innocence \u2014 was part of what she wanted to see enshrined in legislation to help the wrongfully convicted. She pushed for exonerees to be cleared of all blame, to have their records sealed and have something official that noted their innocence.\n\u201cRecognizing the fault and taking ownership of it \u2014 that\u2019s extremely overlooked,\u201d she said, noting that Berry hadn\u2019t received an official apology until last month.\nIn the weeks after the conversation with her dad, Kaitlyn Herndon wrote a reparations proposal for the Legislature\u2019s consideration. She asked her dad how best to navigate the politics of this kind of bill when deciding how far to take it.\n\u201cYou ask for everything,\u201d Doug Herndon said he told her. \u201cEverybody found factually innocent should be compensated in some fashion.\u201d\nWith about a month left before she\u2019d need to return to Washington University in St. Louis, Kaitlyn Herndon nervously gathered several key stakeholders to get them on board and hash out any sticky issues.\nAssemblyman Steve Yeager, a former public defender who had been thinking about the need for this type of legislation for years, agreed to spearhead the bill. He composed and sponsored the legislation.\nIn March, Kaitlyn Herndon flew back from school to help campaign for its passage and testify at a hearing on the bill before the Assembly Judiciary Committee, which Yeager heads. Berry\u2019s testimony had the room in tears. Even with the family connection to Steese, Herndon said it had been easy to \u201cfeel very distant when it\u2019s all numbers, statutes and bullet points, as it really was for many months. But to finally meet [Berry and his wife] in person and to joke and chat with them was one of the most important experiences in my life.\u201d\nThis month, the judiciary committee unanimously passed the resulting bill and it will soon go to the Assembly floor, where it has broad bipartisan support. Then it will head to the Senate, where it also has wide support. As written, the legislation would award exonerees more money the longer they spent behind bars. For those wrongfully imprisoned for one to 10 years, the payout would be $50,000 for each year. The amount would rise to $75,000 per year for exonerees who serve 11 to 17 years and to $85,000 for 18 to 20 years. For those imprisoned for more than 20 years, like Berry and Steese, the payout per year is $100,000. The bill also provides other resources, such as tuition assistance and counseling.\nKaitlyn Herndon said she had zeroed in on legislation on the books in Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Hawaii and Ohio as inspiration.\n\u201cStates that were pushing not only monetary compensation but actual services to get people to a place to be more situated to be in the world,\u201d she said.\nThe compensation given in other places ranges from flat amounts as small as $20,000 to rising scales. Yeager said he blended what was done elsewhere and liked the idea of recognizing that more time locked away should be worth more money.\nBoth Steese, now 55, and Berry could be entitled to more than $2 million if the bill passes.\nIronically, given Doug Herndon\u2019s regret, if the Nevada District Attorneys Association has its way, Steese would be written out of the bill.\nSteese had an unusual path to exoneration. Despite a judge\u2019s ruling that Steese was actually innocent, the Clark County District Attorney\u2019s Office refused to concede that it had convicted the wrong man. Instead, the new assigned prosecutor said she would fight to keep Steese behind bars, appealing or retrying him for the murder. Fearing a system that had already wrongfully convicted him once, Steese agreed in 2013 to a confounding deal called an Alford plea, which allowed him to maintain his innocence while still pleading guilty. In exchange, the state let him go.\nBut in the eyes of the law, he remained a convicted murderer. Only an eventual pardon four years later \u2014 which the Clark County District Attorney fought \u2014 cleared his name. All but one of the members of the pardon commission, which includes the governor, voted to grant Steese a full pardon. \u201cLet there be no residual stain on his record,\u201d one of the commission members said at the time.\nThe bill as currently written includes a special acknowledgement of cases like Steese\u2019s, noting that compensation will be awarded if \u201cthe person was pardoned by the State Board of Pardons Commissioners on the grounds that the person was innocent.\u201d The DA association has proposed striking that provision.\nAs far as Steese\u2019s civil lawyer Lisa Rasmussen knows, he\u2019s the only one in the state of Nevada to be pardoned based on actual innocence. Leaving him out, \u201cwould do nothing more than perpetuate a cruelty upon him,\u201d she said. It\u2019s time for Nevada to compensate the wrongfully convicted like other states have done, she said, \u201cand Fred is included in that category of unfortunate people.\u201d\nJennifer Noble, a prosecutor with Washoe County and an officer with the DA association, said the association supports the intent of the bill, but not the language. The association wants the burden of proof for innocence to be stricter in order to qualify.\nSo far, lawmakers have declined to alter the bill to reflect the association\u2019s changes or to exclude cases like Steese\u2019s.\n\u201cTo somehow bar [Steese] from recovery under the statute would be really unjust,\u201d Yeager said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me to have that avenue available.\u201d\nSteese, now a long-haul trucker based in California, said he thought the bill was overdue. \u201cThey took 21 years of my life. I lost a sister and a mother while I was in prison, so I think they owe me a lot.\u201d He said he\u2019d use any money he received to buy his own truck.\nShould the bill pass, it would go into effect in October. In total, based on the known exonerees, the bill is estimated to end up costing Nevada about $10 million, Yeager said.\nDoug Herndon, who sat in the audience for the hearing, said that he appreciated having a connection to the proposed law through his daughter. \u201cIt is in my mind a really humbling and beautiful irony that she\u2019s involved,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know about the Steese case before this started,\u201d Kaitlyn Herndon said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I was able to develop a passion for it on my own. It\u2019s a black-and-white issue: What happened was wrong and we need to do better.\u201d",

In another offer, the company, which bills itself as the state&rsquo;s largest nonprofit plan, focuses on cash: &ldquo;The more subscribers you enroll &hellip; the bigger the payout.&rdquo; Bonuses, it says, top out at $100,000 per group, and &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no limit to the number of bonuses you can earn.</p>\n<p>Such incentives sound like typical business tactics, until you understand who ends up paying for them: the employers who sign up with the insurers &mdash; and, of course, their employees.</p>\n<p>Human resource directors often rely on independent health insurance brokers to guide them through the thicket of costly and confusing benefit options offered by insurance companies. But what many don&rsquo;t fully realize is how the health insurance industry steers the process through lucrative financial incentives and commissions. Those enticements, critics say, don&rsquo;t reward brokers for finding their clients the most cost-effective options.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how it typically works: Insurers pay brokers a commission for the employers they sign up. That fee is usually a healthy 3 to 6 percent of the total premium. That could be about $50,000 a year on the premiums of a company with 100 people, payable for as long as the plan is in place. That&rsquo;s $50,000 a year for a single client. And as the client pays more in premiums, the broker&rsquo;s commission increases.</p>\n<p>Commissions can be even higher, up to 40 or 50 percent of the premium, on supplemental plans that employers can buy to cover employees&rsquo; dental costs, cancer care or long-term hospitalization.</p>\n<p>Those commissions come from the insurers. But the cost is built into the premiums the employer and employees pay for the benefit plan.</p>\n<p>Now, layer on top of that the additional bonuses that brokers can earn from some insurers. The offers, some marked &ldquo;confidential,&rdquo; are easy to find on the websites of insurance companies and broker agencies. But many brokers say the bonuses are not disclosed to employers unless they ask. These bonuses, too, are indirectly included in the overall cost of health plans.</p>\n<p>These industry payments can&rsquo;t help but influence which plans brokers highlight for employers, said Eric Campbell, director of research at the University of Colorado Center for Bioethics and Humanities.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a classic conflict of interest,&rdquo; Campbell said.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s &ldquo;a large body of virtually irrefutable evidence,&rdquo; Campbell said, that shows drug company payments to doctors influence the way they prescribe. &ldquo;Denying this effect is like denying that gravity exists.&rdquo; And there&rsquo;s no reason, he said, to think brokers are any different.</p>\n<p>Critics say the setup is akin to a single real estate agent representing both the buyer and seller in a home sale. A buyer would not expect the seller&rsquo;s agent to negotiate the lowest price or highlight all the clauses and fine print that add unnecessary costs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you want to draw a straight conclusion: It has been in the best interest of a broker, from a financial point of view, to keep that premium moving up,&rdquo; said Jeffrey Hogan, a regional manager in Connecticut for a national insurance brokerage and one of a band of outliers in the industry pushing for changes in the way brokers are paid.</p>\n<p>As the average cost of employer-sponsored health insurance premiums has tripled in the past two decades, to almost $20,000 for a family of four, a small, but growing, contingent of brokers are questioning their role in the rise in costs. They&rsquo;ve started negotiating flat fees paid directly by the employers. The fee may be a similar amount to the commission they could have earned, but since it doesn&rsquo;t come from the insurer, Hogan said, it &ldquo;eliminates the conflict of interest&rdquo; and frees brokers to consider unorthodox plans tailored to individual employers&rsquo; needs. Any bonuses could also be paid directly by the employer.</p>\n<p>Brokers provide a variety of services to employers. They present them with benefits options, enroll them in plans and help them with claims and payment issues. Insurance industry payments to brokers are not illegal and have been accepted as a cost of doing business for generations. When brokers are paid directly by employers, the results can be mutually beneficial.</p>\n<p>In 2017, David Contorno, the broker for Palmer Johnson Power Systems, a heavy-equipment distribution company in Madison, Wisconsin, saved the firm so much money while also improving coverage that Palmer Johnson took all 120 employees on an all-expenses paid trip to Vail, Colorado, where they rode four-wheelers and went whitewater rafting. In 2018, the company saved money again and rewarded each employee with a health care &ldquo;dividend&rdquo; of about $700.</p>\n<figure data-pp-blocktype=\"image\" data-pp-id=\"4\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 826px, (min-width: 780px) calc(46.09vw + 43px), (min-width: 600px) 59.38vw, 93.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20190219-insurance-brokers-contorno.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190219-insurance-brokers-contorno.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190219-insurance-brokers-contorno.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190219-insurance-brokers-contorno.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20190219-insurance-brokers-contorno.jpg 2000w\"></img><figcaption>Benefits broker David Contorno in his Mooresville, North Carolina, office. Contorno changed his payment structure so he gets paid by the employers he advises, not insurance companies.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Contorno is not being altruistic. He earned a flat fee, plus a bonus based on how much the plan saved, with the total equal to roughly what would have made otherwise.</p>\n<p>Craig Parsons, who owns Palmer Johnson, said the new payment arrangement puts pressure on the broker to prevent overspending. His previous broker, he said, didn&rsquo;t have any real incentive to help him reduce costs. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have an advocate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have someone truly watching out for our best interests.&rdquo; (The former broker acknowledged there were some issues, but said it had provided a valuable service.)</p>\n<h3>Working for Employers, Not Insurers</h3>\n<p>Contorno is part of a group called the <a href=\"https://healthrosetta.org/\">Health Rosetta</a>, which certifies brokers who agree to follow certain best practices related to health benefits, including eliminating any hidden agreements that raise the cost of employee benefits. To be certified, brokers (who refer to themselves as &ldquo;benefits advisers&rdquo;) must disclose all their direct and indirect sources of income &mdash; bonuses, commissions, consulting fees, for example &mdash; and who pays them to the employers they advise.</p>\n<p>Dave Chase, a Washington businessman, created Rosetta in 2016 after working with tech health startups and launching Microsoft&rsquo;s services to the health industry. He said he saw an opportunity to transform the health care industry by changing the way employers buy benefits. He said brokers have the most underestimated role in the health care system. &ldquo;The good ones are worth their weight in gold,&rdquo; Chase said. &ldquo;But most of the benefit brokers are pitching themselves as buyer&rsquo;s agents, but they are paid like a seller&rsquo;s agent.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There are only 110 Rosetta certified brokers in an industry of more than 100,000, although others who follow a similar philosophy consider themselves part of the movement.</p>\n<p>From the employer&rsquo;s point of view, one big advantage of working with brokers like those certified by Rosetta, is transparency. Currently, there&rsquo;s no industry standard for how brokers must disclose their payments from insurance companies, so many employers may have no idea how much brokers are making from their business, said Marcy Buckner, vice president of government affairs for the National Association of Health Underwriters, the trade group for health benefits brokers. And thus, she said, employers have no clear sense of the conflicts of interest that may color their broker&rsquo;s advice to them.</p>\n<p>Buckner&rsquo;s group encourages brokers to bill employers for their commissions directly to eliminate any conflict of interest, but, she said, it&rsquo;s challenging to shift the culture. Nevertheless, Buckner said she doesn&rsquo;t think payments from insurers undermine the work done by brokers, who must act in their clients&rsquo; best interests or risk losing them. &ldquo;They want to have these clients for a really long term,&rdquo; Buckner said.</p>\n<p>Industrywide, transparency is not the standard. ProPublica sent a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5683744-Questions-for-Brokers.html\">list of questions</a> to 10 of the largest broker agencies, some worth $1 billion or more, including Marsh &amp; McLennan, Aon and Willis Towers Watson, asking if they took bonuses and commissions from insurance companies, and whether they disclosed them to their clients. Four firms declined to answer; the others never responded despite repeated requests.</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"6\">   <figure><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/why-your-health-insurer-does-not-care-about-your-big-bills\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 335px, (min-width: 960px) calc(18.38vw + 23px), (min-width: 780px) 18.75vw, (min-width: 600px) 27.5vw, 43.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20180525-michael-frank-insurance-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20180525-michael-frank-insurance-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20180525-michael-frank-insurance-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20180525-michael-frank-insurance-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/why-your-health-insurer-does-not-care-about-your-big-bills\">Why Your Health Insurer Doesn&rsquo;t Care About Your Big Bills</a></figcaption></figure>    </aside>\n<p>Insurers also don&rsquo;t seem to have a problem with the payments. In 2017, Health Care Service Corporation, which oversees Blue Cross Blue Shield plans serving 15 million members in five states, disclosed in its corporate filings that it spent $816 million on broker bonuses and commissions, about 3 percent of its revenue that year. A company spokeswoman acknowledged in an email that employers are actually the ones who pay those fees; the money is just passed through the insurer. &ldquo;We do not believe there is a conflict of interest,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>In one email to a broker reviewed by ProPublica, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina called the bonuses it offered &mdash; up to $110,000 for bringing in a group of more than 1,000 &mdash; the &ldquo;cherry on top.&rdquo; The company told ProPublica that such bonuses are standard and that it always encourages brokers to &ldquo;match their clients with the best product for them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cathryn Donaldson, spokeswoman for the trade group America&rsquo;s Health Insurance Plans, said in an email that brokers are incentivized &ldquo;above all else&rdquo; to serve their clients. &ldquo;Guiding employees to a plan that offers quality, affordable care will help establish their business and reputation in the industry,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Some insurer&rsquo;s pitches, however, clearly reward brokers&rsquo; devotion to them, not necessarily their clients. &ldquo;To thank you for your loyalty to Humana, we want to extend our thanks with a bonus,&rdquo; says one brochure pitched to brokers online. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey offered brokers a bonus as &ldquo;a way to express our appreciation for your support.&rdquo; Empire Blue Cross told brokers it would deliver new bonuses &ldquo;for bringing in large group business ... and for keeping it with us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Delta Dental of California&rsquo;s pitches appears to go one step further, rewarding brokers as &ldquo;key members of our Small Business Program team.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>ProPublica reached out to all the insurers named in this story, and many didn&rsquo;t respond. Cigna said in a statement that it offers affordable, high-quality benefit plans and doesn&rsquo;t see a problem with providing incentives to brokers. Delta Dental emphasized in an email it follows applicable laws and regulations. And Horizon Blue Cross said its gives employers the option of how to pay brokers and discloses all compensation.</p>\n<p>The effect of such financial incentives is troubling, said Michael Thompson, president of the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, which represents groups of employers who provide benefits. He said brokers don&rsquo;t typically undermine their clients in a blatant way, but their own financial interests can create a &ldquo;cozy relationship&rdquo; that may make them wary of &ldquo;stirring the pot.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Employers should know how their brokers are paid, but health care is complex, so they are often not even aware of what they should ask, Thompson said. Employers rely on brokers to be a &ldquo;trusted adviser,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Sometimes that trust is warranted and sometimes it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>Bad Faith Tactics</h3>\n<p>When officials in Morris County, New Jersey, sought a new broker to manage the county&rsquo;s benefits, they specified that applicants could not take insurance company payouts related to their business. Instead, the county would pay the broker directly to ensure an unbiased search for the best benefits. The county hired Frenkel Benefits, a New York City broker, in February 2015.</p>\n<p>Now, the county is suing the firm in Superior Court of New Jersey, accusing it of double-dipping. In addition to the fees from the county, the broker is accused of collecting a $235,000 commission in 2016 from the insurance giant Cigna. The broker got an additional $19,206 the next year, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5141626-MorrisCountyBrokerComplaint.html\">the lawsuit</a> claims. To get the commission, one of the agency&rsquo;s brokers allegedly certified, falsely, that the county would be told about the payment, the suit said. The county claims it was never notified and never approved the commission.</p>\n<p>The suit also alleges the broker &ldquo;purposefully concealed&rdquo; the costs of switching the county&rsquo;s health coverage to Cigna, which included administrative fees of $800,000.</p>\n<p>In an interview, John Bowens, the county&rsquo;s attorney, said the county had tried to guard against the broker being swayed by a large commission from an insurer. The brokers at Frenkel did not respond to requests for comment. The firm has not filed a response to the claims in the lawsuit. Steven Weisman, one of attorneys representing Frenkel, declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Sometimes employers don&rsquo;t find out their broker didn&rsquo;t get them the best deal until they switch to another broker.</p>\n<p>Josh Butler, a broker in Amarillo, Texas, who is also certified by Rosetta, recently took on a company of about 200 employees that had been signed up for a plan that had high out-of-pocket costs. The previous broker had enrolled the company in a supplemental plan that paid workers $1,000 if they were admitted to the hospital to help pay for uncovered costs. But Butler said the premiums for this coverage cost about $100,000 a year, and only nine employees had used it. That would make it much cheaper to pay for the benefit without insurance.</p>\n<p>Butler suspects the previous broker encouraged the hospital benefits because they came with a sizable commission. He sells the same type of policies for the same insurer, so he knows the plan came with a 40 percent commission in the first year. That means about $40,000 of the employer&rsquo;s premium went into the broker&rsquo;s pocket.</p>\n<p>Butler and other brokers said the insurance companies offer huge commissions to promote lucrative supplemental plans like dental, vision and disability. The total commissions on a supplemental cancer plan one insurer offered come to 57 percent, Butler said.</p>\n<p>These massive year-one commissions lead some unscrupulous brokers to &ldquo;churn&rdquo; their supplemental benefits, Butler said, convincing employers to jump between insurers every year for the same type of benefits. The insurers don&rsquo;t mind, Butler said, because the employers end up paying the tab. Brokers may also &ldquo;product dump,&rdquo; Butler said, which means pushing employers to sign employees up for multiple types of voluntary supplemental coverage, which brings them a hefty commission on each product.</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"8\">   <figure><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/in-montana-a-tough-negotiator-proved-employers-do-not-have-to-pay-so-much-for-health-care\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 335px, (min-width: 960px) calc(18.38vw + 23px), (min-width: 780px) 18.75vw, (min-width: 600px) 27.5vw, 43.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20181002-montana-healthcare-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20181002-montana-healthcare-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20181002-montana-healthcare-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20181002-montana-healthcare-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/in-montana-a-tough-negotiator-proved-employers-do-not-have-to-pay-so-much-for-health-care\">In Montana, a Tough Negotiator Proved Employers Don&rsquo;t Have to Pay So Much for Health Care</a></figcaption></figure>    </aside>\n<p>Carl Schuessler, a broker in Atlanta who is certified by the Rosetta group, said he likes to help employers find out how much profit insurers are making on their premiums. Some states require insurers to provide the information, so when he took over the account for The Gasparilla Inn, an island resort on the Gulf Coast of Florida, he obtained the report for the company&rsquo;s recent three years of coverage with UnitedHealthcare. He learned that the insurer had only paid out in claims about 65 percent of what the Inn had paid in premiums.</p>\n<p>But in those same years the insurer had increased the Inn&rsquo;s premiums, said Glenn Price, its chief financial officer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough to swallow&rdquo; increases to our premium when the insurer is making healthy profits, Price said. UnitedHealthcare declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Schuessler, who is paid by the Inn, helped it transition to a self-funded plan, meaning the company bears the cost of the health care bills. Price said the Inn went from spending about $1 million a year to about $700,000, with lower costs and better benefits for employees, and no increases in three years.</p>\n<h3>A Need for Regulation</h3>\n<p>Despite the important function of brokers as middlemen, there&rsquo;s been scant examination of their role in the marketplace.</p>\n<p>Don Reiman, head of a Boise, Idaho, broker agency and a financial planner, said the federal government should require health benefit brokers to adhere to the same regulation he sees in the finance arena. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act, better known as ERISA, requires retirement plan advisers to disclose to employers all compensation that&rsquo;s related to their plans, exposing potential conflicts.</p>\n<p>The Department of Labor requires certain employers that provide health benefits to file documents every year about their plans, including payments to brokers. The department posts the information on its website.</p>\n<p>But the data is notoriously messy. After a 2012 report found 23 percent of the forms contained errors, there was a proposal to revamp the data collection in 2016. It is unclear if that work was done, but ProPublica tried to analyze the data and found it incomplete or inaccurate. The data shortcomings mean employers have no real ability to compare payments to brokers.</p>\n<p>About five years ago, Contorno, one of the leaders in the Rosetta movement, was blithely happy with the status quo: He had his favored insurers and could usually find traditional plans that appeared to fit his clients&rsquo; needs.</p>\n<p>Today, he regrets his role in driving up employers&rsquo; health costs. One of his <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-have-stockholm-syndrome-insurance-carriersall-us-david-contorno/\">LinkedIn posts</a> compares the industry&rsquo;s acceptance of control by insurance companies to Stockholm Syndrome, the feelings of trust a hostage would have toward a captor.</p>\n<p>Contorno began advising Palmer Johnson in 2016. When he took over, the company had a self-funded plan and its claims were reviewed by an administrator owned by its broker, Iowa-based Cottingham &amp; Butler. Contorno brought in an independent claims administrator who closely scrutinized the claims and provided detailed cost information. The switch led to significant savings, said Parsons, the company owner. &ldquo;It opened our eyes to what a good claims review process can mean to us,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Brad Plummer, senior vice president for employee benefits for Cottingham &amp; Butler, acknowledged &ldquo;things didn&rsquo;t go swimmingly&rdquo; with the claims company. But overall his company provided valuable service to Palmer Johnson, he said.</p>\n<p>Contorno also provided resources to help Palmer Johnson employees find high-quality, low-cost providers, and the company waived any out-of-pocket expense as an incentive to get employees to see those medical providers. If a patient needed an out-of-network procedure, the price was negotiated up front to avoid massive surprise bills to the plan or the patient. The company also contracted with a vendor for drug coverage that does not use the secret rebates and hidden pricing schemes that are common in the industry. Palmer Johnson&rsquo;s yearly health care costs per employee dropped by more than 25 percent, from about $11,252 in 2015 to $8,288 in 2018. That&rsquo;s lower than they&rsquo;d been in 2011, Contorno said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Now that my compensation is fully tied to meeting the clients&rsquo; goals, that is my sole objective,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your broker works for whoever is cutting them the check.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "The pitches to the health insurance brokers are tantalizing.\n\u201cSet sail for Bermuda,\u201d says insurance giant Cigna, offering top-selling brokers five days at one of the island\u2019s luxury resorts.\nHealth Net of California\u2019s pitch is not subtle: A smiling woman in a business suit rides a giant $100 bill like it\u2019s a surfboard. \u201cSell more, enroll more, get paid more!\u201d In some cases, its ad says, a broker can \u201cpower up\u201d the bonus to $150,000 per employer group.\nNot to be outdone, New York\u2019s EmblemHealth promises top-selling brokers \u201cthe chance of a lifetime\u201d: going to bat against the retired legendary New York Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera. In another offer, the company, which bills itself as the state\u2019s largest nonprofit plan, focuses on cash: \u201cThe more subscribers you enroll \u2026 the bigger the payout.\u201d Bonuses, it says, top out at $100,000 per group, and \u201cthere\u2019s no limit to the number of bonuses you can earn.\nSuch incentives sound like typical business tactics, until you understand who ends up paying for them: the employers who sign up with the insurers \u2014 and, of course, their employees.\nHuman resource directors often rely on independent health insurance brokers to guide them through the thicket of costly and confusing benefit options offered by insurance companies. But what many don\u2019t fully realize is how the health insurance industry steers the process through lucrative financial incentives and commissions. Those enticements, critics say, don\u2019t reward brokers for finding their clients the most cost-effective options.\nHere\u2019s how it typically works: Insurers pay brokers a commission for the employers they sign up. That fee is usually a healthy 3 to 6 percent of the total premium. That could be about $50,000 a year on the premiums of a company with 100 people, payable for as long as the plan is in place. That\u2019s $50,000 a year for a single client. And as the client pays more in premiums, the broker\u2019s commission increases.\nCommissions can be even higher, up to 40 or 50 percent of the premium, on supplemental plans that employers can buy to cover employees\u2019 dental costs, cancer care or long-term hospitalization.\nThose commissions come from the insurers. But the cost is built into the premiums the employer and employees pay for the benefit plan.\nNow, layer on top of that the additional bonuses that brokers can earn from some insurers. The offers, some marked \u201cconfidential,\u201d are easy to find on the websites of insurance companies and broker agencies. But many brokers say the bonuses are not disclosed to employers unless they ask. These bonuses, too, are indirectly included in the overall cost of health plans.\nThese industry payments can\u2019t help but influence which plans brokers highlight for employers, said Eric Campbell, director of research at the University of Colorado Center for Bioethics and Humanities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a classic conflict of interest,\u201d Campbell said.\nThere\u2019s \u201ca large body of virtually irrefutable evidence,\u201d Campbell said, that shows drug company payments to doctors influence the way they prescribe. \u201cDenying this effect is like denying that gravity exists.\u201d And there\u2019s no reason, he said, to think brokers are any different.\nCritics say the setup is akin to a single real estate agent representing both the buyer and seller in a home sale. A buyer would not expect the seller\u2019s agent to negotiate the lowest price or highlight all the clauses and fine print that add unnecessary costs.\n\u201cIf you want to draw a straight conclusion: It has been in the best interest of a broker, from a financial point of view, to keep that premium moving up,\u201d said Jeffrey Hogan, a regional manager in Connecticut for a national insurance brokerage and one of a band of outliers in the industry pushing for changes in the way brokers are paid.\nAs the average cost of employer-sponsored health insurance premiums has tripled in the past two decades, to almost $20,000 for a family of four, a small, but growing, contingent of brokers are questioning their role in the rise in costs. They\u2019ve started negotiating flat fees paid directly by the employers. The fee may be a similar amount to the commission they could have earned, but since it doesn\u2019t come from the insurer, Hogan said, it \u201celiminates the conflict of interest\u201d and frees brokers to consider unorthodox plans tailored to individual employers\u2019 needs. Any bonuses could also be paid directly by the employer.\nBrokers provide a variety of services to employers. They present them with benefits options, enroll them in plans and help them with claims and payment issues. Insurance industry payments to brokers are not illegal and have been accepted as a cost of doing business for generations. When brokers are paid directly by employers, the results can be mutually beneficial.\nIn 2017, David Contorno, the broker for Palmer Johnson Power Systems, a heavy-equipment distribution company in Madison, Wisconsin, saved the firm so much money while also improving coverage that Palmer Johnson took all 120 employees on an all-expenses paid trip to Vail, Colorado, where they rode four-wheelers and went whitewater rafting. In 2018, the company saved money again and rewarded each employee with a health care \u201cdividend\u201d of about $700.\nContorno is not being altruistic. He earned a flat fee, plus a bonus based on how much the plan saved, with the total equal to roughly what would have made otherwise.\nCraig Parsons, who owns Palmer Johnson, said the new payment arrangement puts pressure on the broker to prevent overspending. His previous broker, he said, didn\u2019t have any real incentive to help him reduce costs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an advocate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have someone truly watching out for our best interests.\u201d (The former broker acknowledged there were some issues, but said it had provided a valuable service.)\nWorking for Employers, Not Insurers\nContorno is part of a group called the Health Rosetta, which certifies brokers who agree to follow certain best practices related to health benefits, including eliminating any hidden agreements that raise the cost of employee benefits. To be certified, brokers (who refer to themselves as \u201cbenefits advisers\u201d) must disclose all their direct and indirect sources of income \u2014 bonuses, commissions, consulting fees, for example \u2014 and who pays them to the employers they advise.\nDave Chase, a Washington businessman, created Rosetta in 2016 after working with tech health startups and launching Microsoft\u2019s services to the health industry. He said he saw an opportunity to transform the health care industry by changing the way employers buy benefits. He said brokers have the most underestimated role in the health care system. \u201cThe good ones are worth their weight in gold,\u201d Chase said. \u201cBut most of the benefit brokers are pitching themselves as buyer\u2019s agents, but they are paid like a seller\u2019s agent.\u201d\nThere are only 110 Rosetta certified brokers in an industry of more than 100,000, although others who follow a similar philosophy consider themselves part of the movement.\nFrom the employer\u2019s point of view, one big advantage of working with brokers like those certified by Rosetta, is transparency. Currently, there\u2019s no industry standard for how brokers must disclose their payments from insurance companies, so many employers may have no idea how much brokers are making from their business, said Marcy Buckner, vice president of government affairs for the National Association of Health Underwriters, the trade group for health benefits brokers. And thus, she said, employers have no clear sense of the conflicts of interest that may color their broker\u2019s advice to them.\nBuckner\u2019s group encourages brokers to bill employers for their commissions directly to eliminate any conflict of interest, but, she said, it\u2019s challenging to shift the culture. Nevertheless, Buckner said she doesn\u2019t think payments from insurers undermine the work done by brokers, who must act in their clients\u2019 best interests or risk losing them. \u201cThey want to have these clients for a really long term,\u201d Buckner said.\nIndustrywide, transparency is not the standard. ProPublica sent a list of questions to 10 of the largest broker agencies, some worth $1 billion or more, including Marsh & McLennan, Aon and Willis Towers Watson, asking if they took bonuses and commissions from insurance companies, and whether they disclosed them to their clients. Four firms declined to answer; the others never responded despite repeated requests.\nInsurers also don\u2019t seem to have a problem with the payments. In 2017, Health Care Service Corporation, which oversees Blue Cross Blue Shield plans serving 15 million members in five states, disclosed in its corporate filings that it spent $816 million on broker bonuses and commissions, about 3 percent of its revenue that year. A company spokeswoman acknowledged in an email that employers are actually the ones who pay those fees; the money is just passed through the insurer. \u201cWe do not believe there is a conflict of interest,\u201d she said.\nIn one email to a broker reviewed by ProPublica, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina called the bonuses it offered \u2014 up to $110,000 for bringing in a group of more than 1,000 \u2014 the \u201ccherry on top.\u201d The company told ProPublica that such bonuses are standard and that it always encourages brokers to \u201cmatch their clients with the best product for them.\u201d\nCathryn Donaldson, spokeswoman for the trade group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said in an email that brokers are incentivized \u201cabove all else\u201d to serve their clients. \u201cGuiding employees to a plan that offers quality, affordable care will help establish their business and reputation in the industry,\u201d she said.\nSome insurer\u2019s pitches, however, clearly reward brokers\u2019 devotion to them, not necessarily their clients. \u201cTo thank you for your loyalty to Humana, we want to extend our thanks with a bonus,\u201d says one brochure pitched to brokers online. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey offered brokers a bonus as \u201ca way to express our appreciation for your support.\u201d Empire Blue Cross told brokers it would deliver new bonuses \u201cfor bringing in large group business ... and for keeping it with us.\u201d\nDelta Dental of California\u2019s pitches appears to go one step further, rewarding brokers as \u201ckey members of our Small Business Program team.\u201d\nProPublica reached out to all the insurers named in this story, and many didn\u2019t respond. Cigna said in a statement that it offers affordable, high-quality benefit plans and doesn\u2019t see a problem with providing incentives to brokers. Delta Dental emphasized in an email it follows applicable laws and regulations. And Horizon Blue Cross said its gives employers the option of how to pay brokers and discloses all compensation.\nThe effect of such financial incentives is troubling, said Michael Thompson, president of the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, which represents groups of employers who provide benefits. He said brokers don\u2019t typically undermine their clients in a blatant way, but their own financial interests can create a \u201ccozy relationship\u201d that may make them wary of \u201cstirring the pot.\u201d\nEmployers should know how their brokers are paid, but health care is complex, so they are often not even aware of what they should ask, Thompson said. Employers rely on brokers to be a \u201ctrusted adviser,\u201d he added. \u201cSometimes that trust is warranted and sometimes it\u2019s not.\u201d\nBad Faith Tactics\nWhen officials in Morris County, New Jersey, sought a new broker to manage the county\u2019s benefits, they specified that applicants could not take insurance company payouts related to their business. Instead, the county would pay the broker directly to ensure an unbiased search for the best benefits. The county hired Frenkel Benefits, a New York City broker, in February 2015.\nNow, the county is suing the firm in Superior Court of New Jersey, accusing it of double-dipping. In addition to the fees from the county, the broker is accused of collecting a $235,000 commission in 2016 from the insurance giant Cigna. The broker got an additional $19,206 the next year, the lawsuit claims. To get the commission, one of the agency\u2019s brokers allegedly certified, falsely, that the county would be told about the payment, the suit said. The county claims it was never notified and never approved the commission.\nThe suit also alleges the broker \u201cpurposefully concealed\u201d the costs of switching the county\u2019s health coverage to Cigna, which included administrative fees of $800,000.\nIn an interview, John Bowens, the county\u2019s attorney, said the county had tried to guard against the broker being swayed by a large commission from an insurer. The brokers at Frenkel did not respond to requests for comment. The firm has not filed a response to the claims in the lawsuit. Steven Weisman, one of attorneys representing Frenkel, declined to comment.\nSometimes employers don\u2019t find out their broker didn\u2019t get them the best deal until they switch to another broker.\nJosh Butler, a broker in Amarillo, Texas, who is also certified by Rosetta, recently took on a company of about 200 employees that had been signed up for a plan that had high out-of-pocket costs. The previous broker had enrolled the company in a supplemental plan that paid workers $1,000 if they were admitted to the hospital to help pay for uncovered costs. But Butler said the premiums for this coverage cost about $100,000 a year, and only nine employees had used it. That would make it much cheaper to pay for the benefit without insurance.\nButler suspects the previous broker encouraged the hospital benefits because they came with a sizable commission. He sells the same type of policies for the same insurer, so he knows the plan came with a 40 percent commission in the first year. That means about $40,000 of the employer\u2019s premium went into the broker\u2019s pocket.\nButler and other brokers said the insurance companies offer huge commissions to promote lucrative supplemental plans like dental, vision and disability. The total commissions on a supplemental cancer plan one insurer offered come to 57 percent, Butler said.\nThese massive year-one commissions lead some unscrupulous brokers to \u201cchurn\u201d their supplemental benefits, Butler said, convincing employers to jump between insurers every year for the same type of benefits. The insurers don\u2019t mind, Butler said, because the employers end up paying the tab. Brokers may also \u201cproduct dump,\u201d Butler said, which means pushing employers to sign employees up for multiple types of voluntary supplemental coverage, which brings them a hefty commission on each product.\nCarl Schuessler, a broker in Atlanta who is certified by the Rosetta group, said he likes to help employers find out how much profit insurers are making on their premiums. Some states require insurers to provide the information, so when he took over the account for The Gasparilla Inn, an island resort on the Gulf Coast of Florida, he obtained the report for the company\u2019s recent three years of coverage with UnitedHealthcare. He learned that the insurer had only paid out in claims about 65 percent of what the Inn had paid in premiums.\nBut in those same years the insurer had increased the Inn\u2019s premiums, said Glenn Price, its chief financial officer. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to swallow\u201d increases to our premium when the insurer is making healthy profits, Price said. UnitedHealthcare declined to comment.\nSchuessler, who is paid by the Inn, helped it transition to a self-funded plan, meaning the company bears the cost of the health care bills. Price said the Inn went from spending about $1 million a year to about $700,000, with lower costs and better benefits for employees, and no increases in three years.\nA Need for Regulation\nDespite the important function of brokers as middlemen, there\u2019s been scant examination of their role in the marketplace.\nDon Reiman, head of a Boise, Idaho, broker agency and a financial planner, said the federal government should require health benefit brokers to adhere to the same regulation he sees in the finance arena. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act, better known as ERISA, requires retirement plan advisers to disclose to employers all compensation that\u2019s related to their plans, exposing potential conflicts.\nThe Department of Labor requires certain employers that provide health benefits to file documents every year about their plans, including payments to brokers. The department posts the information on its website.\nBut the data is notoriously messy. After a 2012 report found 23 percent of the forms contained errors, there was a proposal to revamp the data collection in 2016. It is unclear if that work was done, but ProPublica tried to analyze the data and found it incomplete or inaccurate. The data shortcomings mean employers have no real ability to compare payments to brokers.\nAbout five years ago, Contorno, one of the leaders in the Rosetta movement, was blithely happy with the status quo: He had his favored insurers and could usually find traditional plans that appeared to fit his clients\u2019 needs.\nToday, he regrets his role in driving up employers\u2019 health costs. One of his LinkedIn posts compares the industry\u2019s acceptance of control by insurance companies to Stockholm Syndrome, the feelings of trust a hostage would have toward a captor.\nContorno began advising Palmer Johnson in 2016. When he took over, the company had a self-funded plan and its claims were reviewed by an administrator owned by its broker, Iowa-based Cottingham & Butler. Contorno brought in an independent claims administrator who closely scrutinized the claims and provided detailed cost information. The switch led to significant savings, said Parsons, the company owner. \u201cIt opened our eyes to what a good claims review process can mean to us,\u201d he said.\nBrad Plummer, senior vice president for employee benefits for Cottingham & Butler, acknowledged \u201cthings didn\u2019t go swimmingly\u201d with the claims company. But overall his company provided valuable service to Palmer Johnson, he said.\nContorno also provided resources to help Palmer Johnson employees find high-quality, low-cost providers, and the company waived any out-of-pocket expense as an incentive to get employees to see those medical providers. If a patient needed an out-of-network procedure, the price was negotiated up front to avoid massive surprise bills to the plan or the patient. The company also contracted with a vendor for drug coverage that does not use the secret rebates and hidden pricing schemes that are common in the industry. Palmer Johnson\u2019s yearly health care costs per employee dropped by more than 25 percent, from about $11,252 in 2015 to $8,288 in 2018. That\u2019s lower than they\u2019d been in 2011, Contorno said.\n\u201cNow that my compensation is fully tied to meeting the clients\u2019 goals, that is my sole objective,\u201d he said. \u201cYour broker works for whoever is cutting them the check.\u201d",

The energy company PSEG says it needs about $300 million in subsidies over the next three years to keep them open.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The energy company PSEG had a simple message for the New Jersey Legislature as it weighed the fate of three nuclear plants in the state.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s good for New Jersey is what&rsquo;s good for PSEG,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://corporate.pseg.com/aboutpseg/leadershipandgovernance/executiveofficers/psegcompanyexecutive\">Ralph Izzo</a>, the company&rsquo;s chairman, president and CEO, told the Legislature at a December 2017 hearing in Trenton. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s bad for New Jersey is bad for PSEG.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And with rock bottom natural gas prices, costly safety upgrades looming and energy usage flat, the outlook for the plants was bleak, he said. Within two years, the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants in South Jersey would be &ldquo;cash negative&rdquo; and the company would have to close them, Izzo said.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of people would lose their jobs. And the state would lose a source of cleaner energy generation, forcing it to rely more heavily on natural gas. But the Legislature could avert that, Izzo said. To keep the plants open, PSEG would need about $300 million in subsidies over the next three years.</p>\n<p>It would be a &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; for the company&rsquo;s nuclear operations in New Jersey, Izzo said. It would not, he emphasized, be &ldquo;a bailout.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On Thursday, regulators in New Jersey are scheduled to decide whether PSEG has shown that it needs the subsidies, which would be paid for through a surcharge on all customer bills in the state. If the Board of Public Utilities approves the <a href=\"https://corporate.pseg.com/aboutpseg/companyinformation/thepsegfamilyofcompanies/zec_applications\">requests</a>, New Jersey would join two other states, Illinois and New York, in giving nuclear power plants hundreds of millions of dollars in order to stay competitive in the wholesale energy market.</p>\n<p>The campaign for the subsidies took to the pages of the state&rsquo;s largest newspaper, The Star-Ledger, this week. A full-page ad on Monday signed by the employees of the Salem and Hope Creek plants, and another on Tuesday, signed by eight former New Jersey governors, praised the subsidy plan and warned of the consequences of not acting.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have seen the devastating impacts to families, communities and the environment as nuclear plants in other states have closed,&rdquo; the employee ad said. &ldquo;At the end of the day, we believe that the contributions made by Salem and Hope Creek are much too important to live without.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The payments are designed to compensate nuclear plants for the clean energy they supply to the state.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;New Jersey has been given an opportunity to preserve its safe, productive nuclear plants,&rdquo; the former governors wrote. &ldquo;We would be wise to take it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A spokeswoman for PSEG, Marijke Shugrue, said the company had paid for the ads but that the idea to show support for nuclear energy came from the employees and the former governors.</p>\n<h3>Nuclear Power Comes of Age</h3>\n<p>The nuclear power industry is grappling with a new reality, brought on by the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo16/MT_naturalgas.php#natgasprod_exp\">natural gas boom</a> of the early 2000s.</p>\n<p>The country began commercially generating electricity from nuclear power in the late 1950s. Production ramped up in the &rsquo;60s, which means many of the nation&rsquo;s plants are nearing the end of their 40-year licenses or operating under 20-year extensions.</p>\n<p>Today, there are 98 nuclear reactors at 60 plants in the United States, <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=38792\">according</a> to the federal Energy Information Administration. Seven plants have been retired since 2013, including the Oyster Creek plant in New Jersey. More plants have announced plans to close in the coming years.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Given how rapidly things have changed, even for the nuclear industry that&rsquo;s been pretty stable and just operating in the United States for the last 40 years or so, they&rsquo;re caught off guard by these changing market conditions,&rdquo; said Kristy Hartman, of the National Conference of State Legislatures, and co-author of a <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/energy/StateOptions_NuclearPower_f02_WEB.pdf\">report</a> on state efforts to keep nuclear plants open.</p>\n<p>Natural gas use has grown in part, because of the shale revolution, where technology allowed developers to use fracking to extract previously untappable deposits of the fossil fuel, <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/sec1_5.pdf\">flooding</a> the market and <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n3045us3M.htm\">driving</a> down prices.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Natural gas has been so cheap, it&rsquo;s driven down the cost of wholesale power overall,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/experts/mark-szybist\">Mark Szybist</a>, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. &ldquo;That makes it difficult for nuclear power to be profitable.

Some 64% of that came from fossil fuels, including 35% from natural gas. Collectively, renewables, such as solar power, provide about 17% of the nation&rsquo;s energy. Roughly 19% came from nuclear energy, according to the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=21\">EIA</a>.</p>\n<p>The industry has maintained its foothold in large part by finding more efficient ways to operate and shortening the amount of time required for maintenance and refueling. But it has had to adapt on other fronts as well. In recent years, the nuclear power industry has ramped up efforts to cultivate influence with legislators and alliances with environmentalists.</p>\n<p>The industry&rsquo;s gains thus far haven&rsquo;t been easy, or cheap.</p>\n<p>In New Jersey, PSEG spent nearly $4 million over the course of 2017 and 2018 lobbying the Legislature on the nuclear subsidies. By comparison, groups lobbying on marijuana legalization, the other big issue of the last two legislative sessions, spent $1.7 million, according to the state <a href=\"https://www.elec.state.nj.us/pdffiles/press_releases/pr_2019/pr_03042019.pdf\">Election Law Enforcement Commission</a>.</p>\n<p>New York and Illinois put in place subsidies in 2017, and New Jersey established a nuclear subsidy last year as part of a <a href=\"https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562018/approved/20180523a_cleanEnergy.shtml\">package</a> of legislation aimed at meeting the state&rsquo;s goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. Legislators in Pennsylvania and <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/ohio-gop-lines-up-bill-to-save-firstenergy-nuclear-plants/552237/\">Ohio</a> are considering similar measures, and this month, Maryland <a href=\"http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2019RS/bills/sb/sb0516e.pdf\">authorized</a> a study to consider if nuclear energy should be eligible for clean-energy credits.</p>\n<p>In each state, the push for subsidies has come after warnings that the plants would have to close. But critics of the programs say that in many instances, the plants are profitable, and the companies are using scare tactics to bully legislators into subsidizing shareholder profits.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They rattled their saber many times,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://illinoispirg.org/staff/usp/abe-scarr\">Abe Scarr</a>, state director of <a href=\"https://illinoispirg.org/page/ilp/about-illinois-pirg\">Illinois Public Interest Research Group</a>, a consumer organization that opposed the subsidies. &ldquo;Regardless of whether it was a bluff or not, certainly their threats were a ploy to build pressure on Illinois decision makers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Threatening to close plants in the name of shareholder profits is a tactic <a href=\"https://www.state.nj.us/rpa/about/director/\">Stefanie Brand</a>, director of the <a href=\"https://www.state.nj.us/rpa/about/attorneys/\">New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel</a>, a state-appointed advocate for utility customers, said she hadn&rsquo;t seen before.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a level of coercion that is really unprecedented,&rdquo; Brand said.</p>\n<p>In an emailed response, PSEG spokeswoman Shugrue said the company believes the applications &ldquo;demonstrated unequivocally that all three of our plants meet the requirements&rdquo; to receive the zero emissions credit or ZEC.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And as we have previously announced, if we don&rsquo;t get the [credits] for all three plants we will shut them down,&rdquo; Shugrue wrote in the email.</p>\n<p>On Monday, PSEG said it <a href=\"https://www.njspotlight.com/stories/19/04/16/critics-slam-psegs-notice-of-nuclear-shutdown-on-eve-of-subsidy-decision/\">would not</a> participate in the upcoming auction to provide power to the wholesale market. Without assurances it would receive the subsidies, the company said its plants would close before the end of the three-year-period for which it would be bidding at the auction, Shugrue said. She said PSEG had to decide by Tuesday whether to participate in the auction, and that the timing of the company&rsquo;s announcement, three days before the BPU decides on the subsidies was &ldquo;merely coincidental.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>A Market Trend</h3>\n<p>If New Jersey becomes the model for a nuclear industry perfecting its survival strategy, the plans in New York and Illinois were prototypes.</p>\n<p>Those states took different paths to bolstering the nuclear power industry &mdash; one by gubernatorial fiat, the other through legislative battle &mdash; yet both secured massive payouts for nuclear companies.</p>\n<p>New York went first.</p>\n<p>In November 2015, New Orleans-based power company Entergy <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/entergy-to-close-james-a-fitzpatrick-nuclear-power-plant-in-central-new-york-300170100.html\">announced</a> plans to close the <a href=\"http://www.exeloncorp.com/locations/power-plants/james-a-fitzpatrick-nuclear-power-plant\">James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant</a>, an 838 megawatt facility in Oswego with more than 600 employees. The move came after negotiations with state officials came up empty.</p>\n<p>Within weeks, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-directs-department-public-service-begin-process-enact-clean-energy-standard\">directed</a> the state Department of Public Service to create a Clean Energy Standard to ensure that by 2030, half of the power in New York would come from renewable sources. He also directed the agency to prevent nuclear plants upstate from retiring early. The agency implemented the zero emissions credit program, which would impose a monthly surcharge on customer bills to pay nuclear utilities subsidies totaling $7.6 billion over a 12-year period.</p>\n<p>Entergy ultimately <a href=\"https://www.entergynewsroom.com/news/entergy-completes-sale-jamesfitzpatrick-nuclear-power-plant-exelon/\">sold the FitzPatrick</a> plant to Exelon, one of the largest power companies in the country.</p>\n<p>Utilities used to be monopolies: producing the power and selling it to customers. But in the 1990s, several states decided to restructure their markets, requiring companies to sell the power they generate on a wholesale market, where utility companies shop for the best deal. <a href=\"https://corporate.pseg.com/aboutpseg/companyinformation/thepsegfamilyofcompanies\">PSEG</a>, for example, generates electricity through its PSG Power subsidiary, and sells it to consumers through its utility arm, PSE&amp;G. The market is run by power-grid operators, which ensure the grid has power available when utilities need it. New York operates its own market, while New Jersey is in <a href=\"https://www.pjm.com/about-pjm/who-we-are.aspx\">PJM Interconnection</a>, along with several other mid-Atlantic states and parts of Illinois.</p>\n<p>In Illinois, Exelon executives had watched its plants&rsquo; profits decline for years. In 2013, it said two facilities &mdash; <a href=\"http://www.exeloncorp.com/locations/power-plants/quad-cities-generating-station\">Quad Cities</a>, a 1,900 megawatt plant along the Mississippi River, and <a href=\"http://www.exeloncorp.com/locations/Documents/Clinton%20Power%20Station%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%202017.pdf\">Clinton</a>, a 1,069 megawatt plant in DeWitt County &mdash; were in financial trouble and might need contracts or other support to ensure the plants remained opened. A <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-xpm-2014-03-09-ct-exelon-closing-nuclear-plants-0308-biz-20140309-story.html\">Chicago Tribune analysis</a> months later showed that none of the six plants the company owned in Illinois had turned a profit since 2008.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that nuclear power is very expensive to operate, it&rsquo;s just natural gas is much cheaper,&rdquo; said Doug Vine, senior fellow at <a href=\"https://www.c2es.org/about/\">C2ES</a>, a climate change think tank. &ldquo;The market has done a good job for consumers, delivering low-cost electricity. But it&rsquo;s missing out on the environmental part of the equation. The market doesn&rsquo;t reward any particular generator for having the attributes we desire.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside>  <p>Get ProPublica&rsquo;s Daily Digest.</p>  </aside>\n<p>Exelon pushed for a subsidy for its Illinois nuclear plants, backing a bill that would have created a zero emission standard to keep the plants online. Then-Attorney General Lisa Madigan denounced the legislation as &ldquo;outrageous,&rdquo; harmful to consumers and a bailout for the nuclear provider and its subsidiary utility company, ComEd.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The legislature has more important matters to address than padding ComEd and Exelon&rsquo;s profits,&rdquo; she said <a href=\"http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2016_05/20160524.html\">at the time</a>. The day after that bill failed, Exelon announced plans to retire the Clinton and Quad Cities plants.</p>\n<p>But before that could happen, the company took one last shot at securing a subsidy. Some environmental and consumer activists, worried that they might miss an opportunity to influence the legislation, were willing to enter <a href=\"https://energynews.us/2016/11/01/midwest/in-illinois-energy-bill-drama-demand-charge-is-central-and-evolving/\">negotiations</a> with the utility and other groups to try to make the subsidy idea viable.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;From a political point of view, they couldn&rsquo;t pass what they wanted without our coalition, which included a whole bunch of environmental groups, consumer groups and labor groups as well,&rdquo; said David Kolata, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, a consumer advocate organization. The board was opposed to the plan initially, but over the course of negotiations, it came on board as protections for consumers and plans to bolster energy efficiency were added, he said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like we liked every element of it, but at the end, we felt it was something worthy of our support,&rdquo; Kolata said.</p>\n<p>In December 2016, the Assembly passed the <a href=\"http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/99/PDF/099-0906.pdf\">Future Energy Jobs Bill</a>, which, in addition to other energy reforms, offers $235 million in annual subsidies to nuclear power plants.</p>\n<p>The plans in New York and Illinois both have been challenged by opponents who say the programs interfere with the wholesale energy markets. But courts have allowed the plans to proceed, and on Monday, the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/041519zor_h3dj.pdf\">declined</a> to hear the challenges.</p>\n<h3>New Jersey Enters the Fray</h3>\n<p>In New Jersey, Brand&rsquo;s office saw the fighting coming its way.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We knew that the company was going to be seeking subsidies, but we didn&rsquo;t know ... exactly what it was going to look like,&rdquo; said Brand, who has led the office since 2007.</p>\n<p>PSEG was watching closely, too. It had seen what states had done for other nuclear companies.</p>\n<p>A few things were already in the company&rsquo;s favor. The state had a long history with nuclear power, as home to Oyster Creek in <a href=\"http://www.laceytownship.org/content/3656/5003.aspx\">Lacey Township</a> on the Jersey Shore, which, for 49 years, was the oldest operating nuclear plant in the country before it closed in 2018. The Exelon-owned facility, which began operating in 1969, was so integral to the area that the township has an atom on its coat of arms.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the state, PSEG&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://corporate.pseg.com/aboutpseg/companyinformation/thepsegfamilyofcompanies/psegnuclearllc\">Hope Creek and Salem</a> plants sit along the Delaware River in Salem County. They make up the second-largest nuclear facility in the country, generating around 3,500 megawatts of electricity &mdash; enough to power 3 million homes. PSEG owns Hope Creek outright, and it shares ownership of Salem with Exelon. Those plants employ more than 1,500 people and are economic anchors in the county, which is represented in the state Legislature by the Senate president, Stephen Sweeney.</p>\n<figure data-pp-blocktype=\"image\" data-pp-id=\"7\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 457px, (min-width: 780px) calc(24.46vw + 41px), (min-width: 600px) 27.5vw, 43.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190417-new-jersey-nuclear-pseg-ad.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190417-new-jersey-nuclear-pseg-ad.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190417-new-jersey-nuclear-pseg-ad.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190417-new-jersey-nuclear-pseg-ad.jpg 1600w\"></img><figcaption>A full-page ad in New Jersey's largest newspaper, The Star-Ledger, was signed by employees of the Salem and Hope Creek plants and paid for by PSEG.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Since 2015, however, natural gas has accounted for the majority of the state&rsquo;s electricity generation, according to the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=NJ\">EIA</a>.</p>\n<p>Nuclear companies, feeling the squeeze from natural gas, are looking to state and federal regulators for potential solutions.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has tried <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/15/rick-perry-coal-rescue-trump-850528\">unsuccessfully</a> to secure bailouts for coal and nuclear plants, citing national security concerns. On the state front, PSEG, Exelon and FirstEnergy, which owns <a href=\"https://www.firstenergycorp.com/content/dam/corporate/fenoc/files/zen-fact-sheet.pdf\">two nuclear plants</a> in Ohio, spent around $5.2 million in 2017 and 2018 lobbying in New Jersey over the nuclear plant legislation, <a href=\"https://www.elec.state.nj.us/pdffiles/press_releases/pr_2019/pr_03042019.pdf\">according</a> to the state election commission.</p>\n<p>Opponents, including AARP, the NJ Petroleum Council and the NJ Coalition for Fair Energy, spent about $4.7 million lobbying against the subsidy. AARP state advocacy director Evelyn Liebman said the group lobbied against the subsidy because it prioritized nuclear energy over lower energy prices from natural gas for customers.</p>\n<p>The surcharge would add an additional $35 to $45 a year to typical residential bills, according to Brand&rsquo;s office. The state&rsquo;s largest commercial customers, who pay millions of dollars in a year in energy costs, would see their annual costs go up, on average, by $570,000, according to <a href=\"https://www.nj.gov/bpu/pdf/publicnotice/zec%20comments/ZEC%20Comments%20with%20attachments.pdf\">comments</a> from the New Jersey Large Energy Users Coalition.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re seeing in these other states and now in New Jersey was the industry coming to the state and asking for a handout not because they were losing money on these plants, but because their profits weren&rsquo;t as high as they wanted them to be,&rdquo; Liebman said.</p>\n<p>Corporate political contributions aren&rsquo;t allowed in New Jersey, but PSEG employees have <a href=\"https://investor.pseg.com/sites/pseg.investorhq.businesswire.com/files/doc_library/file/corp_political_participation_practice.pdf\">established</a> PSExec PAC, a state political action committee that supports state and local candidates.</p>\n<p>Senate President <a href=\"https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/bio.asp?Leg=216\">Sweeney</a> and Assemblyman <a href=\"https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/BIO.asp?Leg=207\">John McKeon</a> were among the main sponsors of legislation aimed at subsidizing the state&rsquo;s nuclear plants. During the 2017 election cycle, PSExec PAC contributed $15,000 to Sweeney, who was running for reelection against Fran Grenier, an employee at PSEG&rsquo;s Salem plant. The $20 million legislative race was the most expensive in state history, <a href=\"https://www.nj.com/politics/2017/11/nj_election_results_2017_sweeney_wins_senate_president_njea.html\">experts said</a>. The PAC contributed $900 to McKeon during that period.</p>\n<p>PSEG ratcheted up the pressure, announcing that it would <a href=\"https://www.njspotlight.com/stories/18/03/04/pseg-exelon-suspend-funding-for-capital-projects-at-salem-nuclear/\">cancel</a> any investments in Salem that weren&rsquo;t required by law or necessary for safe operation. In calls to investors, Izzo said that PSEG welcomed a test to prove they needed a subsidy, but that if states wouldn&rsquo;t sufficiently value the benefits of nuclear energy, PSEG would close the facilities.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not trying to pull a wool over anybody&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; Izzo said in a call on March 6, 2017, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just telling you that it&rsquo;s not a difficult decision for us as a company to retire the assets if they&rsquo;re not achieving their cost of capital.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"9\">   <figure><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/new-jersey-never-ranked-its-most-contaminated-sites\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 335px, (min-width: 960px) calc(18.38vw + 23px), (min-width: 780px) 18.75vw, (min-width: 600px) 27.5vw, 43.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20190220-nj-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190220-nj-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190220-nj-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20190220-nj-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/new-jersey-never-ranked-its-most-contaminated-sites\">New Jersey Said 10 Years Ago It Would Rank Its Most Contaminated Sites. It Never Did.</a></figcaption></figure>    <p>The rankings were supposed to ensure that the most dangerous sites remained a priority even as the state gave private companies a bigger role in cleanups. Today, there are nearly 14,000 contamination sites across New Jersey and still no sign of the mandated rankings.</p>   </aside>\n<p>Brand, who routinely does battle with utility companies seeking higher rates, said in an interview this month that the tactics used in the subsidies fight felt different.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They always argue, &lsquo;Give us what we want, and we&rsquo;ll create jobs,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But [now] it&rsquo;s, &lsquo;Give us what we want, or I&rsquo;m going to close these plants.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Though the subsidy would go to PSEG&rsquo;s nuclear power arm, the surcharge would be collected from all New Jersey electricity customers, no matter who provides their power, Brand said.</p>\n<p>A bill in late 2017 had proposed collecting $0.004 per kilowatt hour from customers to compensate nuclear plants for being a cleaner energy source. Outgoing Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBB7GvJO_Eg&t=36m52s\">said</a> he would sign the bill as long as it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;larded up&rdquo; with any environmental initiatives.</p>\n<p>Brand&rsquo;s warning language became more urgent with each successive version of the legislation. She called the plan a &ldquo;flagrant transfer of wealth&rdquo; and lambasted lawmakers for the &ldquo;rushed process and sloppy legislative language&rdquo; that would &ldquo;come back to haunt us.&rdquo; She invoked images of residential customers &mdash; constituents &mdash; squeezed by high utility bills who can&rsquo;t afford to cool their homes in the summer, or businesses priced out by the cost of electricity bills.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wish [PSEG] cared more about their customers, but I understand that they consider their shareholders their first priority,&rdquo; she <a href=\"https://www.state.nj.us/rpa/docs/S._Brand_Testimony_Nuclear_Power_Plants_December_4_2017_Joint_Committee.pdf\">told legislators</a>. &ldquo;But you were elected by your constituents. Your job is to put them first.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>New Jersey Decides</h3>\n<p>The bill that ultimately became law reflected the changing political climate in New Jersey.</p>\n<p>The stand-alone plan to benefit nuclear power never made it to Christie&rsquo;s desk. Instead, newly elected Gov. Phil Murphy, a liberal Democrat whose campaign championed <a href=\"http://.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2018/01/22/n-j-lawmakers-get-work-murphys-environmental-agenda/1055773001/\">restoring</a> environmental protections, signed a pair of bills in May 2018 aimed at bolstering the state&rsquo;s efforts to rely wholly on clean energy by 2050.</p>\n<p>One bill sought to expand the state&rsquo;s renewable energy programs by, among other things, setting goals for offshore wind, energy storage and energy efficiency, and creating a community solar program. The other required the state Board of Public Utilities to create a zero emissions certificate program to provide a subsidy for nuclear plants that are at risk of closing within three years.</p>\n<p>The strategy that worked in Illinois and New York had worked in New Jersey.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Signing these measures represents a down payment to the people of New Jersey on the clean energy agenda I set forth at the beginning of my administration,&rdquo; Murphy said, signing the bills in May.</p>\n<p>The law laid out a tight timetable: less than a year to hold public hearings, set up the program, accept applications and identify eligible plants. Brand&rsquo;s office was not given automatic access to the documents PSEG was submitting to prove it deserved the subsidies. Instead, she had to petition the attorney general to see the documents; ultimately, Brand and a consultant were given access.</p>\n<p>If approved, the payments would begin this month and run at least until 2022, with a potential three-year extension.</p>\n<p>Already, the industry is taking its lessons to other states. In Pennsylvania, lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.pennlive.com/news/2019/03/nuclear-power-subsidy-bill-introduced-in-pennsylvania.html\">introduced</a> legislation proposing a $500 million subsidy that could benefit the state&rsquo;s five nuclear plants, including Three Mile Island, the site of a <a href=\"https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/tag/three-mile-island/\">1979 partial meltdown</a>.</p>\n<p>Exelon <a href=\"http://www.exeloncorp.com/newsroom/exelon-to-retire-three-mile-island-generating-station-in-2019\">said</a> it plans to close that plant in September unless it receives support.</p>",

Within two years, the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants in South Jersey would be \u201ccash negative\u201d and the company would have to close them, Izzo said.\nHundreds of people would lose their jobs. And the state would lose a source of cleaner energy generation, forcing it to rely more heavily on natural gas. But the Legislature could avert that, Izzo said. To keep the plants open, PSEG would need about $300 million in subsidies over the next three years.\nIt would be a \u201csafety net\u201d for the company\u2019s nuclear operations in New Jersey, Izzo said. It would not, he emphasized, be \u201ca bailout.\u201d\nOn Thursday, regulators in New Jersey are scheduled to decide whether PSEG has shown that it needs the subsidies, which would be paid for through a surcharge on all customer bills in the state. If the Board of Public Utilities approves the requests, New Jersey would join two other states, Illinois and New York, in giving nuclear power plants hundreds of millions of dollars in order to stay competitive in the wholesale energy market.\nThe campaign for the subsidies took to the pages of the state\u2019s largest newspaper, The Star-Ledger, this week. A full-page ad on Monday signed by the employees of the Salem and Hope Creek plants, and another on Tuesday, signed by eight former New Jersey governors, praised the subsidy plan and warned of the consequences of not acting.\n\u201cWe have seen the devastating impacts to families, communities and the environment as nuclear plants in other states have closed,\u201d the employee ad said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we believe that the contributions made by Salem and Hope Creek are much too important to live without.\u201d\nThe payments are designed to compensate nuclear plants for the clean energy they supply to the state.\n\u201cNew Jersey has been given an opportunity to preserve its safe, productive nuclear plants,\u201d the former governors wrote. \u201cWe would be wise to take it.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for PSEG, Marijke Shugrue, said the company had paid for the ads but that the idea to show support for nuclear energy came from the employees and the former governors.\nNuclear Power Comes of Age\nThe nuclear power industry is grappling with a new reality, brought on by the natural gas boom of the early 2000s.\nThe country began commercially generating electricity from nuclear power in the late 1950s. Production ramped up in the \u201960s, which means many of the nation\u2019s plants are nearing the end of their 40-year licenses or operating under 20-year extensions.\nToday, there are 98 nuclear reactors at 60 plants in the United States, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. Seven plants have been retired since 2013, including the Oyster Creek plant in New Jersey. More plants have announced plans to close in the coming years.\n\u201cGiven how rapidly things have changed, even for the nuclear industry that\u2019s been pretty stable and just operating in the United States for the last 40 years or so, they\u2019re caught off guard by these changing market conditions,\u201d said Kristy Hartman, of the National Conference of State Legislatures, and co-author of a report on state efforts to keep nuclear plants open.\nNatural gas use has grown in part, because of the shale revolution, where technology allowed developers to use fracking to extract previously untappable deposits of the fossil fuel, flooding the market and driving down prices.\n\u201cNatural gas has been so cheap, it\u2019s driven down the cost of wholesale power overall,\u201d said Mark Szybist, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cThat makes it difficult for nuclear power to be profitable. There is a trend \u2014 that\u2019s real.\u201d\nIn 2018, the United States generated about 4.18 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity from all sources of energy. Some 64% of that came from fossil fuels, including 35% from natural gas. Collectively, renewables, such as solar power, provide about 17% of the nation\u2019s energy. Roughly 19% came from nuclear energy, according to the EIA.\nThe industry has maintained its foothold in large part by finding more efficient ways to operate and shortening the amount of time required for maintenance and refueling. But it has had to adapt on other fronts as well. In recent years, the nuclear power industry has ramped up efforts to cultivate influence with legislators and alliances with environmentalists.\nThe industry\u2019s gains thus far haven\u2019t been easy, or cheap.\nIn New Jersey, PSEG spent nearly $4 million over the course of 2017 and 2018 lobbying the Legislature on the nuclear subsidies. By comparison, groups lobbying on marijuana legalization, the other big issue of the last two legislative sessions, spent $1.7 million, according to the state Election Law Enforcement Commission.\nNew York and Illinois put in place subsidies in 2017, and New Jersey established a nuclear subsidy last year as part of a package of legislation aimed at meeting the state\u2019s goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. Legislators in Pennsylvania and Ohio are considering similar measures, and this month, Maryland authorized a study to consider if nuclear energy should be eligible for clean-energy credits.\nIn each state, the push for subsidies has come after warnings that the plants would have to close. But critics of the programs say that in many instances, the plants are profitable, and the companies are using scare tactics to bully legislators into subsidizing shareholder profits.\n\u201cThey rattled their saber many times,\u201d said Abe Scarr, state director of Illinois Public Interest Research Group, a consumer organization that opposed the subsidies. \u201cRegardless of whether it was a bluff or not, certainly their threats were a ploy to build pressure on Illinois decision makers.\u201d\nThreatening to close plants in the name of shareholder profits is a tactic Stefanie Brand, director of the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel, a state-appointed advocate for utility customers, said she hadn\u2019t seen before.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a level of coercion that is really unprecedented,\u201d Brand said.\nIn an emailed response, PSEG spokeswoman Shugrue said the company believes the applications \u201cdemonstrated unequivocally that all three of our plants meet the requirements\u201d to receive the zero emissions credit or ZEC.\n\u201cAnd as we have previously announced, if we don\u2019t get the [credits] for all three plants we will shut them down,\u201d Shugrue wrote in the email.\nOn Monday, PSEG said it would not participate in the upcoming auction to provide power to the wholesale market. Without assurances it would receive the subsidies, the company said its plants would close before the end of the three-year-period for which it would be bidding at the auction, Shugrue said. She said PSEG had to decide by Tuesday whether to participate in the auction, and that the timing of the company\u2019s announcement, three days before the BPU decides on the subsidies was \u201cmerely coincidental.\u201d\nA Market Trend\nIf New Jersey becomes the model for a nuclear industry perfecting its survival strategy, the plans in New York and Illinois were prototypes.\nThose states took different paths to bolstering the nuclear power industry \u2014 one by gubernatorial fiat, the other through legislative battle \u2014 yet both secured massive payouts for nuclear companies.\nNew York went first.\nIn November 2015, New Orleans-based power company Entergy announced plans to close the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, an 838 megawatt facility in Oswego with more than 600 employees. The move came after negotiations with state officials came up empty.\nWithin weeks, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo directed the state Department of Public Service to create a Clean Energy Standard to ensure that by 2030, half of the power in New York would come from renewable sources. He also directed the agency to prevent nuclear plants upstate from retiring early. The agency implemented the zero emissions credit program, which would impose a monthly surcharge on customer bills to pay nuclear utilities subsidies totaling $7.6 billion over a 12-year period.\nEntergy ultimately sold the FitzPatrick plant to Exelon, one of the largest power companies in the country.\nUtilities used to be monopolies: producing the power and selling it to customers. But in the 1990s, several states decided to restructure their markets, requiring companies to sell the power they generate on a wholesale market, where utility companies shop for the best deal. PSEG, for example, generates electricity through its PSG Power subsidiary, and sells it to consumers through its utility arm, PSE&G. The market is run by power-grid operators, which ensure the grid has power available when utilities need it. New York operates its own market, while New Jersey is in PJM Interconnection, along with several other mid-Atlantic states and parts of Illinois.\nIn Illinois, Exelon executives had watched its plants\u2019 profits decline for years. In 2013, it said two facilities \u2014 Quad Cities, a 1,900 megawatt plant along the Mississippi River, and Clinton, a 1,069 megawatt plant in DeWitt County \u2014 were in financial trouble and might need contracts or other support to ensure the plants remained opened. A Chicago Tribune analysis months later showed that none of the six plants the company owned in Illinois had turned a profit since 2008.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that nuclear power is very expensive to operate, it\u2019s just natural gas is much cheaper,\u201d said Doug Vine, senior fellow at C2ES, a climate change think tank. \u201cThe market has done a good job for consumers, delivering low-cost electricity. But it\u2019s missing out on the environmental part of the equation. The market doesn\u2019t reward any particular generator for having the attributes we desire.\u201d\nGet ProPublica\u2019s Daily Digest.\nExelon pushed for a subsidy for its Illinois nuclear plants, backing a bill that would have created a zero emission standard to keep the plants online. Then-Attorney General Lisa Madigan denounced the legislation as \u201coutrageous,\u201d harmful to consumers and a bailout for the nuclear provider and its subsidiary utility company, ComEd.\n\u201cThe legislature has more important matters to address than padding ComEd and Exelon\u2019s profits,\u201d she said at the time. The day after that bill failed, Exelon announced plans to retire the Clinton and Quad Cities plants.\nBut before that could happen, the company took one last shot at securing a subsidy. Some environmental and consumer activists, worried that they might miss an opportunity to influence the legislation, were willing to enter negotiations with the utility and other groups to try to make the subsidy idea viable.\n\u201cFrom a political point of view, they couldn\u2019t pass what they wanted without our coalition, which included a whole bunch of environmental groups, consumer groups and labor groups as well,\u201d said David Kolata, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, a consumer advocate organization. The board was opposed to the plan initially, but over the course of negotiations, it came on board as protections for consumers and plans to bolster energy efficiency were added, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we liked every element of it, but at the end, we felt it was something worthy of our support,\u201d Kolata said.\nIn December 2016, the Assembly passed the Future Energy Jobs Bill, which, in addition to other energy reforms, offers $235 million in annual subsidies to nuclear power plants.\nThe plans in New York and Illinois both have been challenged by opponents who say the programs interfere with the wholesale energy markets. But courts have allowed the plans to proceed, and on Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear the challenges.\nNew Jersey Enters the Fray\nIn New Jersey, Brand\u2019s office saw the fighting coming its way.\n\u201cWe knew that the company was going to be seeking subsidies, but we didn\u2019t know ... exactly what it was going to look like,\u201d said Brand, who has led the office since 2007.\nPSEG was watching closely, too. It had seen what states had done for other nuclear companies.\nA few things were already in the company\u2019s favor. The state had a long history with nuclear power, as home to Oyster Creek in Lacey Township on the Jersey Shore, which, for 49 years, was the oldest operating nuclear plant in the country before it closed in 2018. The Exelon-owned facility, which began operating in 1969, was so integral to the area that the township has an atom on its coat of arms.\nOn the other side of the state, PSEG\u2019s Hope Creek and Salem plants sit along the Delaware River in Salem County. They make up the second-largest nuclear facility in the country, generating around 3,500 megawatts of electricity \u2014 enough to power 3 million homes. PSEG owns Hope Creek outright, and it shares ownership of Salem with Exelon. Those plants employ more than 1,500 people and are economic anchors in the county, which is represented in the state Legislature by the Senate president, Stephen Sweeney.\nSince 2015, however, natural gas has accounted for the majority of the state\u2019s electricity generation, according to the EIA.\nNuclear companies, feeling the squeeze from natural gas, are looking to state and federal regulators for potential solutions.\nThe Trump administration has tried unsuccessfully to secure bailouts for coal and nuclear plants, citing national security concerns. On the state front, PSEG, Exelon and FirstEnergy, which owns two nuclear plants in Ohio, spent around $5.2 million in 2017 and 2018 lobbying in New Jersey over the nuclear plant legislation, according to the state election commission.\nOpponents, including AARP, the NJ Petroleum Council and the NJ Coalition for Fair Energy, spent about $4.7 million lobbying against the subsidy. AARP state advocacy director Evelyn Liebman said the group lobbied against the subsidy because it prioritized nuclear energy over lower energy prices from natural gas for customers.\nThe surcharge would add an additional $35 to $45 a year to typical residential bills, according to Brand\u2019s office. The state\u2019s largest commercial customers, who pay millions of dollars in a year in energy costs, would see their annual costs go up, on average, by $570,000, according to comments from the New Jersey Large Energy Users Coalition.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in these other states and now in New Jersey was the industry coming to the state and asking for a handout not because they were losing money on these plants, but because their profits weren\u2019t as high as they wanted them to be,\u201d Liebman said.\nCorporate political contributions aren\u2019t allowed in New Jersey, but PSEG employees have established PSExec PAC, a state political action committee that supports state and local candidates.\nSenate President Sweeney and Assemblyman John McKeon were among the main sponsors of legislation aimed at subsidizing the state\u2019s nuclear plants. During the 2017 election cycle, PSExec PAC contributed $15,000 to Sweeney, who was running for reelection against Fran Grenier, an employee at PSEG\u2019s Salem plant. The $20 million legislative race was the most expensive in state history, experts said. The PAC contributed $900 to McKeon during that period.\nPSEG ratcheted up the pressure, announcing that it would cancel any investments in Salem that weren\u2019t required by law or necessary for safe operation. In calls to investors, Izzo said that PSEG welcomed a test to prove they needed a subsidy, but that if states wouldn\u2019t sufficiently value the benefits of nuclear energy, PSEG would close the facilities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to pull a wool over anybody\u2019s eyes,\u201d Izzo said in a call on March 6, 2017, \u201cI\u2019m just telling you that it\u2019s not a difficult decision for us as a company to retire the assets if they\u2019re not achieving their cost of capital.\u201d\nThe rankings were supposed to ensure that the most dangerous sites remained a priority even as the state gave private companies a bigger role in cleanups. Today, there are nearly 14,000 contamination sites across New Jersey and still no sign of the mandated rankings.\nBrand, who routinely does battle with utility companies seeking higher rates, said in an interview this month that the tactics used in the subsidies fight felt different.\n\u201cThey always argue, \u2018Give us what we want, and we\u2019ll create jobs,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut [now] it\u2019s, \u2018Give us what we want, or I\u2019m going to close these plants.\u2019\u201d\nThough the subsidy would go to PSEG\u2019s nuclear power arm, the surcharge would be collected from all New Jersey electricity customers, no matter who provides their power, Brand said.\nA bill in late 2017 had proposed collecting $0.004 per kilowatt hour from customers to compensate nuclear plants for being a cleaner energy source. Outgoing Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, said he would sign the bill as long as it wasn\u2019t \u201clarded up\u201d with any environmental initiatives.\nBrand\u2019s warning language became more urgent with each successive version of the legislation. She called the plan a \u201cflagrant transfer of wealth\u201d and lambasted lawmakers for the \u201crushed process and sloppy legislative language\u201d that would \u201ccome back to haunt us.\u201d She invoked images of residential customers \u2014 constituents \u2014 squeezed by high utility bills who can\u2019t afford to cool their homes in the summer, or businesses priced out by the cost of electricity bills.\n\u201cI wish [PSEG] cared more about their customers, but I understand that they consider their shareholders their first priority,\u201d she told legislators. \u201cBut you were elected by your constituents. Your job is to put them first.\u201d\nNew Jersey Decides\nThe bill that ultimately became law reflected the changing political climate in New Jersey.\nThe stand-alone plan to benefit nuclear power never made it to Christie\u2019s desk. Instead, newly elected Gov. Phil Murphy, a liberal Democrat whose campaign championed restoring environmental protections, signed a pair of bills in May 2018 aimed at bolstering the state\u2019s efforts to rely wholly on clean energy by 2050.\nOne bill sought to expand the state\u2019s renewable energy programs by, among other things, setting goals for offshore wind, energy storage and energy efficiency, and creating a community solar program. The other required the state Board of Public Utilities to create a zero emissions certificate program to provide a subsidy for nuclear plants that are at risk of closing within three years.\nThe strategy that worked in Illinois and New York had worked in New Jersey.\n\u201cSigning these measures represents a down payment to the people of New Jersey on the clean energy agenda I set forth at the beginning of my administration,\u201d Murphy said, signing the bills in May.\nThe law laid out a tight timetable: less than a year to hold public hearings, set up the program, accept applications and identify eligible plants. Brand\u2019s office was not given automatic access to the documents PSEG was submitting to prove it deserved the subsidies. Instead, she had to petition the attorney general to see the documents; ultimately, Brand and a consultant were given access.\nIf approved, the payments would begin this month and run at least until 2022, with a potential three-year extension.\nAlready, the industry is taking its lessons to other states. In Pennsylvania, lawmakers introduced legislation proposing a $500 million subsidy that could benefit the state\u2019s five nuclear plants, including Three Mile Island, the site of a 1979 partial meltdown.\nExelon said it plans to close that plant in September unless it receives support.",

That also means it&rsquo;s bankruptcy season. Every year, bankruptcy filings peak in March and stay elevated in April, as people use their precious tax refunds to finally purchase the thing they couldn&rsquo;t afford before: bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>All sorts of bad things happen <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/when-you-cannot-afford-to-go-bankrupt\">when bankruptcy is out of reach for people</a>, as we showed in <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/series/too-broke-for-bankruptcy\">a series of stories</a>. People turn to <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-to-get-away-with-bankruptcy-fraud\">unscrupulous operators who file phony bankruptcy cases, as happens often in Los Angeles</a>. Particularly <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/bankruptcy-chapter-13\">in the South</a>, they turn to a form of bankruptcy that features a payment plan and that often ends in failure, <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/bankruptcy-inequality/bankruptcy-failing-black-americans-debt-chapter-13/\">leaving debtors worse off than when they filed</a>. (<a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/bankruptcy-inequality/bankruptcy-failing-black-americans-debt-chapter-13/\">African Americans</a> are especially prone to that problem.) And finally, many people don&rsquo;t file at all &mdash; and just hope that a debt collector <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/so-sue-them-what-weve-learned-about-the-debt-collection-lawsuit-machine\">doesn&rsquo;t seize their wages</a>.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5819752-ABI-Consumer-Commission.html\">a report</a> issued Thursday, the American Bankruptcy Institute, which counts 13,000 judges, attorneys and other professionals among its members, offered a range of fixes for the bankruptcy system. Chief among them were suggestions on how Congress could change the law to make bankruptcy more accessible.</p>\n<p>The main cost when filing bankruptcy is paying an attorney (which typically runs around $1,000), but the laws essentially require debtors to come up with the money up front. That&rsquo;s particularly hard for people who are being squeezed by debt, so the report by the ABI&rsquo;s Consumer Commission <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5819752-ABI-Consumer-Commission.html#document/p110\">recommended making it possible for debtors to pay their attorneys over time</a> after filing. This would require a change of the law, because attorney fees are usually wiped out just like any other debt when someone files for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>The report also acknowledged widespread racial disparities in bankruptcy filings. As we showed in <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/bankruptcy-inequality/bankruptcy-failing-black-americans-debt-chapter-13/\">a story that focused on Memphis, Tennessee</a>, the city with the highest bankruptcy filing rate in the country, black debtors are churned through a system that rarely results in debt actually being erased. We also published <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/bankruptcy-data-analysis\">an extensive data analysis</a> that showed it&rsquo;s a national trend. The ABI report <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5819752-ABI-Consumer-Commission.html#document/p180\">cited our work</a> alongside other academic studies demonstrating the problem. (The report also noted <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/series/driven-into-debt\">ProPublica Illinois&rsquo; work</a> on how Chicago&rsquo;s punitive traffic ticket system has pushed many black debtors into bankruptcy.)</p>\n<p>In the &ldquo;Racial Justice in Bankruptcy&rdquo; section of the report, the authors recommended that bankruptcy organizations offer implicit bias training as part of their legal education offerings and that the courts begin to collect information about debtors&rsquo; race and ethnicity in order to more concretely show the disparities. But as we noted in our stories, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/when-you-cannot-afford-to-go-bankrupt\">making bankruptcy more affordable</a> would do the most to curb this problem.</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"4\"><figure><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/bankruptcy-inequality/bankruptcy-failing-black-americans-debt-chapter-13/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo1200w/20170927-bankruptcy-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo400w/20170927-bankruptcy-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo800w/20170927-bankruptcy-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo1200w/20170927-bankruptcy-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/bankruptcy-inequality/bankruptcy-failing-black-americans-debt-chapter-13/\">How the Bankruptcy System Is Failing Black Americans</a></figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>There are a host of other recommendations in the report. Some of them are rather technical. Some could have a major effect on the lives of millions of Americans. In particular, the commission recommended <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5819752-ABI-Consumer-Commission.html#document/p20\">making it possible for debtors to wipe out student loan debt</a> after a period of years. Currently, debtors have to demonstrate remarkable financial hardship in order to get relief, a standard that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/your-money/student-loans/judges-rebuke-limits-on-wiping-out-student-loan-debt.html\">judges have criticized as unreasonable</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, relying on Congress to get things done is never a sure path to change. And the last time Congress passed a big bankruptcy reform bill in 2005, the results were <a href=\"https://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=10533\">very damaging to low-income families</a>. But the ABI is an influential organization on this topic, and some prominent Democrats, <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/W000817-elizabeth-warren\">Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts</a>, among them, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/when-you-cannot-afford-to-go-bankrupt\">have already endorsed the idea</a> of making bankruptcy more accessible.</p>",

                "text": "It\u2019s tax season. That also means it\u2019s bankruptcy season. Every year, bankruptcy filings peak in March and stay elevated in April, as people use their precious tax refunds to finally purchase the thing they couldn\u2019t afford before: bankruptcy.\nAll sorts of bad things happen when bankruptcy is out of reach for people, as we showed in a series of stories. People turn to unscrupulous operators who file phony bankruptcy cases, as happens often in Los Angeles. Particularly in the South, they turn to a form of bankruptcy that features a payment plan and that often ends in failure, leaving debtors worse off than when they filed. (African Americans are especially prone to that problem.) And finally, many people don\u2019t file at all \u2014 and just hope that a debt collector doesn\u2019t seize their wages.\nIn a report issued Thursday, the American Bankruptcy Institute, which counts 13,000 judges, attorneys and other professionals among its members, offered a range of fixes for the bankruptcy system. Chief among them were suggestions on how Congress could change the law to make bankruptcy more accessible.\nThe main cost when filing bankruptcy is paying an attorney (which typically runs around $1,000), but the laws essentially require debtors to come up with the money up front. That\u2019s particularly hard for people who are being squeezed by debt, so the report by the ABI\u2019s Consumer Commission recommended making it possible for debtors to pay their attorneys over time after filing. This would require a change of the law, because attorney fees are usually wiped out just like any other debt when someone files for bankruptcy.\nThe report also acknowledged widespread racial disparities in bankruptcy filings. As we showed in a story that focused on Memphis, Tennessee, the city with the highest bankruptcy filing rate in the country, black debtors are churned through a system that rarely results in debt actually being erased. We also published an extensive data analysis that showed it\u2019s a national trend. The ABI report cited our work alongside other academic studies demonstrating the problem. (The report also noted ProPublica Illinois\u2019 work on how Chicago\u2019s punitive traffic ticket system has pushed many black debtors into bankruptcy.)\nIn the \u201cRacial Justice in Bankruptcy\u201d section of the report, the authors recommended that bankruptcy organizations offer implicit bias training as part of their legal education offerings and that the courts begin to collect information about debtors\u2019 race and ethnicity in order to more concretely show the disparities. But as we noted in our stories, making bankruptcy more affordable would do the most to curb this problem.\nThere are a host of other recommendations in the report. Some of them are rather technical. Some could have a major effect on the lives of millions of Americans. In particular, the commission recommended making it possible for debtors to wipe out student loan debt after a period of years. Currently, debtors have to demonstrate remarkable financial hardship in order to get relief, a standard that judges have criticized as unreasonable.\nOf course, relying on Congress to get things done is never a sure path to change. And the last time Congress passed a big bankruptcy reform bill in 2005, the results were very damaging to low-income families. But the ABI is an influential organization on this topic, and some prominent Democrats, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, among them, have already endorsed the idea of making bankruptcy more accessible.",

Old or broken equipment would be fixed, too. Most important, the Navy&rsquo;s top command would stop forcing ships out to sea before they were ready.</p>\n<p>In late 2017, as part of an effort to assure commanders that the Navy was committed to genuine reform, Adm. Philip Davidson embarked on a speaking tour. Davidson was in charge of &ldquo;readiness&rdquo; &mdash; responsible for making sure that the Navy&rsquo;s ships were fully staffed, and that sailors were adequately trained and equipped and ready for combat. He had recently authored a public report laying out dozens of specific weaknesses that the Navy had begun fixing.</p>\n<p>One of Davidson&rsquo;s stops in November 2017 was in San Diego, and inside the base&rsquo;s movie theater, he addressed hundreds of concerned commanders and officers. He was met with a series of tough questions, including a particularly sensitive one: If the commanders believed their ships were not ready, could they, as the Navy had promised, actually push back on orders to sail?</p>\n<p>Davidson, according to an admiral inside the theater, responded with anger.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t take your ships to sea and accomplish the mission with the resources you have,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;then we&rsquo;ll find someone who will.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The response roiled the audience, and word of it quickly spread among Navy officers across the globe, according to interviews done by ProPublica. Many took it as a sign that the Navy as an institution had failed to heed the painful lessons of its worst disasters at sea in four decades. In June 2017, the <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/navy-accidents/uss-fitzgerald-destroyer-crash-crystal/\">USS Fitzgerald collided with a giant cargo ship</a> in the Pacific and seven sailors died. Months later, the <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/navy-accidents/us-navy-crashes-japan-cause-mccain/\">USS John S. McCain</a>, another destroyer in the Navy&rsquo;s heralded 7th Fleet, was struck by an oil tanker, and 10 more sailors were lost. The Navy&rsquo;s investigations of the accidents in the Pacific showed that many of its sailors were poorly trained and worked to exhaustion.</p>\n<p>One of the admirals in San Diego that day was Thomas Rowden. He had been among a number of senior Navy leaders who had warned that the 7th Fleet was vulnerable in the months before the 2017 crashes, and he&rsquo;d been pushed out in their aftermath. To him, Davidson&rsquo;s response meant the Navy remained willing to put its sailors at risk if that&rsquo;s what it took to meet the demands of higher-ups.</p>\n<p>Rowden, who recounted the San Diego meeting in an interview with ProPublica, said that if he was alarmed by Davidson&rsquo;s presentation, he was impressed by those who had asked the hard questions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was proud of them for their forthrightness,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and speaking truth to power.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Davidson, who today is the top military commander in the Pacific, said through a spokesman that his remarks in San Diego might have been misinterpreted, and that he only meant to say that if ships were not fit to sail, they would be replaced by others that were. No one, he said, would be fired or replaced for responsibly raising safety concerns.</p>\n<p>A ProPublica investigation this month <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/navy-accidents/uss-fitzgerald-destroyer-crash-crystal/\">reconstructed</a> the fatal voyage of the Fitzgerald and revealed the <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/navy-accidents/us-navy-crashes-japan-cause-mccain/\">years of warnings</a> ignored by senior Navy officials before the collisions involving the Fitzgerald and the McCain. The stories described mistakes by the officers in command of the ships, but they also showed that senior Navy leaders had helped set the conditions for failure and ignored years of warnings. Ships in the 7th Fleet were not fully qualified for missions. They were lacking sailors with expertise in navigation. Radars were broken or operated incorrectly. Warship commanders faced unrelenting demands to conduct missions in the Pacific as North Korea, China and Russia emerged as growing threats.</p>\n<p>The articles have prompted an outpouring of response from current and former Navy officials up and down the chain of command. Many, like those in the audience in San Diego, are worried the Navy remains vulnerable to deadly accidents. Indeed, interviews and an examination of the Navy&rsquo;s publicly announced reforms raise doubts about whether senior leaders have fully delivered on their promises more than 18 months after the 7th Fleet disasters.</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"4\"><figure><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/navy-accidents/uss-fitzgerald-destroyer-crash-crystal/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo1200w/20190206-uss-fitzgerald-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo400w/20190206-uss-fitzgerald-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo800w/20190206-uss-fitzgerald-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo1200w/20190206-uss-fitzgerald-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a></figure><figure><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/navy-accidents/us-navy-crashes-japan-cause-mccain/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_oneOne150w/20190207-big-navy-1x1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_oneOne75w/20190207-big-navy-1x1.jpg 75w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_oneOne150w/20190207-big-navy-1x1.jpg 150w\"></img></a></figure></aside>\n<p>One officer said Navy leaders are misrepresenting how well-trained their crews are by temporarily loaning specialists from his destroyer to other ships just before their crews undergo testing. Ships that cannot meet new training and staffing goals are nonetheless granted special permission and sent to sea. Another officer said higher-ups had raided his destroyer for parts to ensure that other warships were ready to deploy.</p>\n<p>Some sailors said the Navy&rsquo;s reforms appear to have focused more on improving test scores on navigational skills and not on fixing real problems, like the inability to operate missile defense equipment.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;People are crossing their fingers and saying, &lsquo;My God, I hope this works out,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the second in command of one Navy destroyer. The officer on the destroyer, like others interviewed for this article, requested anonymity for fear of reprisal. &ldquo;Hope has become a course of action.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A veteran sailor said he has seen crew members who are fearful of accidents and uncertain about how to operate radars and other critical equipment. On Feb. 5, 2019, two Navy ships collided off the coast of Florida during a training exercise, though there were no injuries.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what would happen if there was a major conflict,&rdquo; the sailor said. &ldquo;When your systems aren&rsquo;t up or working, what really are you but a cruise ship?&rdquo;\u200b</p>\n<p>The 7th Fleet is the largest armada in the world and one of America&rsquo;s most strategic military commands, central to containing China and defending against North Korean ballistic missiles. It has thus come under intense pressure in recent years to regularly demonstrate its might, conducting both secret missions and very public displays of force.</p>\n<p>John Pendleton, one of the senior directors of the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, was one of many who had warned Navy leaders in the months and years before the crashes that the 7th Fleet&rsquo;s ships were being run ragged: training was declining, crews were too small and ships were deteriorating. The Pentagon wrote to the GAO that the Navy was &ldquo;well aware of the risks&rdquo; and accepted them as the cost of increasing its presence in the region.</p>\n<p>Now, even after the crashes underscored the consequences of those risks, Pendleton said he had lingering questions about the Navy&rsquo;s commitment. Last fall, Pendleton went to inspect the operations of the 7th Fleet.

The Navy&rsquo;s renewed focus on training was evident, he said. But sailors told him they were still fatigued from 100-hour work weeks. Several reported the Navy was playing &ldquo;shell games&rdquo; by shuffling sailors around to make it appear as though ships were fully manned. Maintaining aging, hard-driven ships was proving a stubborn problem.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m concerned that under-manning is at the root of the Navy&rsquo;s problems,&rdquo; Pendleton said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure they will solve it any time soon.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Senior Navy leaders are scheduled to publicly detail the status of their reform efforts at a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>In their last appearance, after ProPublica published its investigation this month, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/navy-7th-fleet-armed-services-committee-hearing-philip-davidson-collisions\">Davidson defended the Navy</a> by noting that the vast majority of ships were not crashing, a remark that drew widespread derision.</p>\n<p>In an interview with ProPublica on Monday, Adm. Bill Moran, the Navy&rsquo;s second in command, said the Navy has committed $1 billion to fixing the problems it has identified since the collisions.</p>\n<p>Moran said the Navy has begun to work on 91 of 103 initiatives, such as providing more sailors to under-manned ships in Japan and stopping ships from sailing without complete certifications regarding their navigation and war-fighting abilities &mdash; both issues in the collisions of the Fitzgerald and the McCain in 2017.</p>\n<p>But he acknowledged that the Navy has not, to date, completed any of the reforms. He said that because of the scope and complexity of the effort, it will take time to transform an institution the size of the Navy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learned some tough lessons from these mishaps. We&rsquo;ve been doing everything we can to institutionalize these changes that we&rsquo;ve identified,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"8\"><figure><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/navy-accidents/uss-fitzgerald-mccain-crash-victims-japan/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo1200w/20190209-navy-casualty-gallery-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo400w/20190209-navy-casualty-gallery-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo800w/20190209-navy-casualty-gallery-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo1200w/20190209-navy-casualty-gallery-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a></figure></aside>\n<p>Asked specifically about some of the claims made by sailors and officers interviewed by ProPublica, Moran said he had no reason to doubt them.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight,&rdquo; Moran said of the reforms.</p>\n<p>For the past year, Moran has personally led the effort to implement the Navy&rsquo;s reforms as co-chairman of the Readiness Reform and Oversight Council, along with the undersecretary of the Navy, Thomas B. Modly.</p>\n<p>So far, Navy leaders say they&rsquo;ve launched a new command in Japan that will ensure that ships get enough time for training and maintenance. They say they have increased the amount of training provided to officers to emphasize navigation. And they say they have deployed advanced simulators to help officers learn how to work with other sailors on a watch.</p>\n<p>Moran produced charts showing that the new programs are beginning to have an effect. The Navy hadn&rsquo;t filled 7,400 at sea slots in 2018. The number has now dropped to 6,200 unfilled positions. Ships in Japan had been sailing with well under 90 percent of their crew. Today, the ships have 100 percent, he said.</p>\n<p>But some of the Navy&rsquo;s pledged reforms are vague and lack clear measures to gauge success. One proposed change calls for the Navy to &ldquo;create a forward-looking learning culture built upon systemic data analyses.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s supposed to start in September. Another seeks to &ldquo;ensure Navy leaders are fully aware of the consequences of their decisions regarding near and long-term readiness and operations.&rdquo; The start date is &ldquo;TBD&rdquo; &mdash; to be determined.</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"10\"><figure><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/is-your-ship-safe-navy-fleet-reforms\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/getInvolved/_threeTwo1200w/20190226-navy-callout-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/getInvolved/_threeTwo400w/20190226-navy-callout-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/getInvolved/_threeTwo800w/20190226-navy-callout-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/getInvolved/_threeTwo1200w/20190226-navy-callout-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/is-your-ship-safe-navy-fleet-reforms\">Help Us Find Out Whether Navy Reforms Are Actually Making a Difference</a></figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>Other reforms have proven less than fully effective. In September, the Navy announced a new system to track the hours that officers spend standing watch, similar to how pilots track their time in the cockpit.</p>\n<p>The Navy said it intended to use the new data to analyze trends among officers&rsquo; experiences in standing watch. Instead, it provided officers with bound notebooks in which they could keep track of their time by hand.</p>\n<p>The information isn&rsquo;t entered into a centralized database or used by Navy leaders to better understand whether officers are spending enough time standing watch on ship bridges or combat rooms.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These are low-tech, high-honor-system records,&rdquo; said another executive officer of a U.S.-based ship. &ldquo;They have fixed the wrong thing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Moran agreed that more needed to be done: We &ldquo;need to be entering this into a database and analyzing it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get after that,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>The officer on the U.S.-based ship said the Navy had also pledged to create a system to track near-misses at sea. The Fitzgerald had been involved in three such incidents in the weeks before its collision. But the system, he said, involved writing up an incident in a Word document and sending it up the chain of command. While a senior commander reviews such reports on an individual basis, no larger analysis of the data is done, the officer said. The officer spoke anonymously because he, too, feared being punished for his candor.</p>\n<p>Moran said he wasn&rsquo;t aware of that practice but called it a &ldquo;fair&rdquo; critique, if true. &ldquo;It speaks to the difference between implementation and completion,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>The officer said his ship, currently undergoing lengthy repairs, had been cannibalized for nearly 20 different parts, including an antenna and a throttle control, to outfit other ships headed for sea duty. In turn, he expected to take parts from other ships before he deployed. The Navy has 288 combat ships.</p>\n<p>While such &ldquo;rolling cannibalizations&rdquo; are supposed to be done sparingly, the officer said they were routinely approved by his commanders.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve adequately learned as an institution,&rdquo; the officer said. &ldquo;The seeds are all there for [accidents] to happen again.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure data-pp-blocktype=\"image\" data-pp-id=\"12\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20190226-davidson-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190226-davidson-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190226-davidson-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190226-davidson-3x2.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20190226-davidson-3x2.jpg 2000w\"></img><figcaption>Davidson testifies during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, February 12, 2019.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Moran said cannibalizations have existed as long as the Navy, but he acknowledged that they are generally undesirable, occurring when parts are not available. To improve, the Navy is streamlining maintenance, even sending out 3D printers to manufacture some parts, he said.</p>\n<p>The lack of trained personnel was a recurring theme that contributed to both crashes. The Fitzgerald had set sail with about 270 sailors, well below the 303 called for by the Navy.</p>\n<p>One of the officers interviewed by ProPublica in recent weeks said senior commanders routinely provided waivers for ships whose commanders reported being unable to meet standards due to a lack of skilled sailors.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Even the newest ships, we are getting waivers all over the place for manning,&rdquo; the executive officer said. &ldquo;All that matters is paperwork. That&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The situation is reminiscent of the Navy&rsquo;s practice of approving waivers for ships in the 7th Fleet to be sent out on missions without being fully certified to conduct navigation and warfare operations. The Navy canceled all such waivers in the aftermath of the crashes.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have to be honest,&rdquo; the executive officer said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go before Congress and say, &lsquo;Yup, we&rsquo;re good to go.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He said many of the conditions detailed in ProPublica&rsquo;s stories remain unchanged. On his ship, he said, sailors might average about five hours of sleep per night, and sometimes get no sleep at all. He described commanders who are afraid of making mistakes and afraid to say no to orders to get underway, even with too few sailors or dodgy equipment, for fear of being fired. They are being pushed to a pace, he said, that is at &ldquo;the lunatic fringe of unsafe.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The captain doesn&rsquo;t even get five hours of sleep, the officer said: &ldquo;His phone is ringing off the hook because we are so sensitive right now to anything happening. By day No. 2, he&rsquo;s a zombie.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And he said he and some of his colleagues remained hesitant to speak up. &ldquo;Davidson is always in our head,&rdquo; he said, referring to his remarks in San Diego.</p>\n<p>A veteran sailor assigned to a destroyer said the Navy&rsquo;s reforms had resulted in more paperwork but little relief for sailors run ragged by constant missions. The officers on the ships are all genuinely trying to make conditions better, he said, but the pace of operations does not allow for real training.</p>\n<p>He described scenarios in which sailors would &ldquo;just have this scared, hopeless look in their eyes telling us they didn&rsquo;t know what to do&rdquo; when systems were down.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I felt like no one knew what they were doing, and it scared me,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>The Navy has focused many of its efforts on improving the training for sailors. But some questioned whether the Navy has gone far enough.</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"14\"><figure><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/navy-7th-fleet-armed-services-committee-hearing-philip-davidson-collisions\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20190212-navy-hearing-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190212-navy-hearing-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190212-navy-hearing-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20190212-navy-hearing-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/navy-7th-fleet-armed-services-committee-hearing-philip-davidson-collisions\">Senate Committee Grills Navy Official Over 2017 Collisions, Seeking Data to Prove Conditions Have Changed</a></figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>Paul Kenney, a midshipman who happened to be training on board the Fitzgerald on the night of the collision, <a href=\"https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2019/february/recent-improvements-swo-training-are-not-enough\">recently wrote</a> that the Navy needed a &ldquo;large scale transformation&rdquo; in schooling surface warfare officers, known as SWOs, the backbone of the Navy&rsquo;s fighting force.</p>\n<p>After years of cutbacks, the Navy has begun implementing increased classroom time and more frequent assessments of officers&rsquo; navigation skills. In the McCain collision, in particular, the sailors on the bridge were unfamiliar with the ship&rsquo;s navigation system and fumbled with its controls before the crash. The Navy has pledged to build better simulators. This month, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer announced plans to radically restructure the Navy&rsquo;s educational system.</p>\n<p>One change since the collisions that struck sailors as especially grim came not from any formal Navy reforms, but from the commanders of the ships they serve on. Commanding officers used to assign sailors with similar jobs to the same sleeping quarters. But in the McCain crash, 10 men, the majority electronics experts, drowned in the same berthing area.</p>\n<p>Now, some commanding officers make sure that sailors with the same skills are not concentrated in any one sleeping compartment. That way, future collisions will be less likely to wipe out an entire skillset on board.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I get that, but that&rsquo;s our solution?&rdquo; one sailor said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s safer for the Navy, but not for us.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "After two of its destroyers were involved in deadly accidents in the summer of 2017, the Navy\u2019s leaders pledged real change: more sailors for their ships, and better training for those sailors and the officers who led them. Old or broken equipment would be fixed, too. Most important, the Navy\u2019s top command would stop forcing ships out to sea before they were ready.\nIn late 2017, as part of an effort to assure commanders that the Navy was committed to genuine reform, Adm. Philip Davidson embarked on a speaking tour. Davidson was in charge of \u201creadiness\u201d \u2014 responsible for making sure that the Navy\u2019s ships were fully staffed, and that sailors were adequately trained and equipped and ready for combat. He had recently authored a public report laying out dozens of specific weaknesses that the Navy had begun fixing.\nOne of Davidson\u2019s stops in November 2017 was in San Diego, and inside the base\u2019s movie theater, he addressed hundreds of concerned commanders and officers. He was met with a series of tough questions, including a particularly sensitive one: If the commanders believed their ships were not ready, could they, as the Navy had promised, actually push back on orders to sail?\nDavidson, according to an admiral inside the theater, responded with anger.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t take your ships to sea and accomplish the mission with the resources you have,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we\u2019ll find someone who will.\u201d\nThe response roiled the audience, and word of it quickly spread among Navy officers across the globe, according to interviews done by ProPublica. Many took it as a sign that the Navy as an institution had failed to heed the painful lessons of its worst disasters at sea in four decades. In June 2017, the USS Fitzgerald collided with a giant cargo ship in the Pacific and seven sailors died. Months later, the USS John S. McCain, another destroyer in the Navy\u2019s heralded 7th Fleet, was struck by an oil tanker, and 10 more sailors were lost. The Navy\u2019s investigations of the accidents in the Pacific showed that many of its sailors were poorly trained and worked to exhaustion.\nOne of the admirals in San Diego that day was Thomas Rowden. He had been among a number of senior Navy leaders who had warned that the 7th Fleet was vulnerable in the months before the 2017 crashes, and he\u2019d been pushed out in their aftermath. To him, Davidson\u2019s response meant the Navy remained willing to put its sailors at risk if that\u2019s what it took to meet the demands of higher-ups.\nRowden, who recounted the San Diego meeting in an interview with ProPublica, said that if he was alarmed by Davidson\u2019s presentation, he was impressed by those who had asked the hard questions.\n\u201cI was proud of them for their forthrightness,\u201d he said, \u201cand speaking truth to power.\u201d\nDavidson, who today is the top military commander in the Pacific, said through a spokesman that his remarks in San Diego might have been misinterpreted, and that he only meant to say that if ships were not fit to sail, they would be replaced by others that were. No one, he said, would be fired or replaced for responsibly raising safety concerns.\nA ProPublica investigation this month reconstructed the fatal voyage of the Fitzgerald and revealed the years of warnings ignored by senior Navy officials before the collisions involving the Fitzgerald and the McCain. The stories described mistakes by the officers in command of the ships, but they also showed that senior Navy leaders had helped set the conditions for failure and ignored years of warnings. Ships in the 7th Fleet were not fully qualified for missions. They were lacking sailors with expertise in navigation. Radars were broken or operated incorrectly. Warship commanders faced unrelenting demands to conduct missions in the Pacific as North Korea, China and Russia emerged as growing threats.\nThe articles have prompted an outpouring of response from current and former Navy officials up and down the chain of command. Many, like those in the audience in San Diego, are worried the Navy remains vulnerable to deadly accidents. Indeed, interviews and an examination of the Navy\u2019s publicly announced reforms raise doubts about whether senior leaders have fully delivered on their promises more than 18 months after the 7th Fleet disasters.\nOne officer said Navy leaders are misrepresenting how well-trained their crews are by temporarily loaning specialists from his destroyer to other ships just before their crews undergo testing. Ships that cannot meet new training and staffing goals are nonetheless granted special permission and sent to sea. Another officer said higher-ups had raided his destroyer for parts to ensure that other warships were ready to deploy.\nSome sailors said the Navy\u2019s reforms appear to have focused more on improving test scores on navigational skills and not on fixing real problems, like the inability to operate missile defense equipment.\n\u201cPeople are crossing their fingers and saying, \u2018My God, I hope this works out,\u2019\u201d said the second in command of one Navy destroyer. The officer on the destroyer, like others interviewed for this article, requested anonymity for fear of reprisal. \u201cHope has become a course of action.\u201d\nA veteran sailor said he has seen crew members who are fearful of accidents and uncertain about how to operate radars and other critical equipment. On Feb. 5, 2019, two Navy ships collided off the coast of Florida during a training exercise, though there were no injuries.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what would happen if there was a major conflict,\u201d the sailor said. \u201cWhen your systems aren\u2019t up or working, what really are you but a cruise ship?\u201d\u200b\nThe 7th Fleet is the largest armada in the world and one of America\u2019s most strategic military commands, central to containing China and defending against North Korean ballistic missiles. It has thus come under intense pressure in recent years to regularly demonstrate its might, conducting both secret missions and very public displays of force.\nJohn Pendleton, one of the senior directors of the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, was one of many who had warned Navy leaders in the months and years before the crashes that the 7th Fleet\u2019s ships were being run ragged: training was declining, crews were too small and ships were deteriorating. The Pentagon wrote to the GAO that the Navy was \u201cwell aware of the risks\u201d and accepted them as the cost of increasing its presence in the region.\nNow, even after the crashes underscored the consequences of those risks, Pendleton said he had lingering questions about the Navy\u2019s commitment. Last fall, Pendleton went to inspect the operations of the 7th Fleet. He walked the decks of ships, talked to sailors and officers and interviewed the fleet\u2019s commanders.\nHe said he was unnerved by some of the things he found. The Navy\u2019s renewed focus on training was evident, he said. But sailors told him they were still fatigued from 100-hour work weeks. Several reported the Navy was playing \u201cshell games\u201d by shuffling sailors around to make it appear as though ships were fully manned. Maintaining aging, hard-driven ships was proving a stubborn problem.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that under-manning is at the root of the Navy\u2019s problems,\u201d Pendleton said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they will solve it any time soon.\u201d\nSenior Navy leaders are scheduled to publicly detail the status of their reform efforts at a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.\nIn their last appearance, after ProPublica published its investigation this month, Davidson defended the Navy by noting that the vast majority of ships were not crashing, a remark that drew widespread derision.\nIn an interview with ProPublica on Monday, Adm. Bill Moran, the Navy\u2019s second in command, said the Navy has committed $1 billion to fixing the problems it has identified since the collisions.\nMoran said the Navy has begun to work on 91 of 103 initiatives, such as providing more sailors to under-manned ships in Japan and stopping ships from sailing without complete certifications regarding their navigation and war-fighting abilities \u2014 both issues in the collisions of the Fitzgerald and the McCain in 2017.\nBut he acknowledged that the Navy has not, to date, completed any of the reforms. He said that because of the scope and complexity of the effort, it will take time to transform an institution the size of the Navy.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned some tough lessons from these mishaps. We\u2019ve been doing everything we can to institutionalize these changes that we\u2019ve identified,\u201d he said.\nAsked specifically about some of the claims made by sailors and officers interviewed by ProPublica, Moran said he had no reason to doubt them.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d Moran said of the reforms.\nFor the past year, Moran has personally led the effort to implement the Navy\u2019s reforms as co-chairman of the Readiness Reform and Oversight Council, along with the undersecretary of the Navy, Thomas B. Modly.\nSo far, Navy leaders say they\u2019ve launched a new command in Japan that will ensure that ships get enough time for training and maintenance. They say they have increased the amount of training provided to officers to emphasize navigation. And they say they have deployed advanced simulators to help officers learn how to work with other sailors on a watch.\nMoran produced charts showing that the new programs are beginning to have an effect. The Navy hadn\u2019t filled 7,400 at sea slots in 2018. The number has now dropped to 6,200 unfilled positions. Ships in Japan had been sailing with well under 90 percent of their crew. Today, the ships have 100 percent, he said.\nBut some of the Navy\u2019s pledged reforms are vague and lack clear measures to gauge success. One proposed change calls for the Navy to \u201ccreate a forward-looking learning culture built upon systemic data analyses.\u201d That\u2019s supposed to start in September. Another seeks to \u201censure Navy leaders are fully aware of the consequences of their decisions regarding near and long-term readiness and operations.\u201d The start date is \u201cTBD\u201d \u2014 to be determined.\nOther reforms have proven less than fully effective. In September, the Navy announced a new system to track the hours that officers spend standing watch, similar to how pilots track their time in the cockpit.\nThe Navy said it intended to use the new data to analyze trends among officers\u2019 experiences in standing watch. Instead, it provided officers with bound notebooks in which they could keep track of their time by hand.\nThe information isn\u2019t entered into a centralized database or used by Navy leaders to better understand whether officers are spending enough time standing watch on ship bridges or combat rooms.\n\u201cThese are low-tech, high-honor-system records,\u201d said another executive officer of a U.S.-based ship. \u201cThey have fixed the wrong thing.\u201d\nMoran agreed that more needed to be done: We \u201cneed to be entering this into a database and analyzing it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get after that,\u201d he added.\nThe officer on the U.S.-based ship said the Navy had also pledged to create a system to track near-misses at sea. The Fitzgerald had been involved in three such incidents in the weeks before its collision. But the system, he said, involved writing up an incident in a Word document and sending it up the chain of command. While a senior commander reviews such reports on an individual basis, no larger analysis of the data is done, the officer said. The officer spoke anonymously because he, too, feared being punished for his candor.\nMoran said he wasn\u2019t aware of that practice but called it a \u201cfair\u201d critique, if true. \u201cIt speaks to the difference between implementation and completion,\u201d he said.\nThe officer said his ship, currently undergoing lengthy repairs, had been cannibalized for nearly 20 different parts, including an antenna and a throttle control, to outfit other ships headed for sea duty. In turn, he expected to take parts from other ships before he deployed. The Navy has 288 combat ships.\nWhile such \u201crolling cannibalizations\u201d are supposed to be done sparingly, the officer said they were routinely approved by his commanders.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve adequately learned as an institution,\u201d the officer said. \u201cThe seeds are all there for [accidents] to happen again.\u201d\nMoran said cannibalizations have existed as long as the Navy, but he acknowledged that they are generally undesirable, occurring when parts are not available. To improve, the Navy is streamlining maintenance, even sending out 3D printers to manufacture some parts, he said.\nThe lack of trained personnel was a recurring theme that contributed to both crashes. The Fitzgerald had set sail with about 270 sailors, well below the 303 called for by the Navy.\nOne of the officers interviewed by ProPublica in recent weeks said senior commanders routinely provided waivers for ships whose commanders reported being unable to meet standards due to a lack of skilled sailors.\n\u201cEven the newest ships, we are getting waivers all over the place for manning,\u201d the executive officer said. \u201cAll that matters is paperwork. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\nThe situation is reminiscent of the Navy\u2019s practice of approving waivers for ships in the 7th Fleet to be sent out on missions without being fully certified to conduct navigation and warfare operations. The Navy canceled all such waivers in the aftermath of the crashes.\n\u201cWe have to be honest,\u201d the executive officer said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go before Congress and say, \u2018Yup, we\u2019re good to go.\u2019\u201d\nHe said many of the conditions detailed in ProPublica\u2019s stories remain unchanged. On his ship, he said, sailors might average about five hours of sleep per night, and sometimes get no sleep at all. He described commanders who are afraid of making mistakes and afraid to say no to orders to get underway, even with too few sailors or dodgy equipment, for fear of being fired. They are being pushed to a pace, he said, that is at \u201cthe lunatic fringe of unsafe.\u201d\nThe captain doesn\u2019t even get five hours of sleep, the officer said: \u201cHis phone is ringing off the hook because we are so sensitive right now to anything happening. By day No. 2, he\u2019s a zombie.\u201d\nAnd he said he and some of his colleagues remained hesitant to speak up. \u201cDavidson is always in our head,\u201d he said, referring to his remarks in San Diego.\nA veteran sailor assigned to a destroyer said the Navy\u2019s reforms had resulted in more paperwork but little relief for sailors run ragged by constant missions. The officers on the ships are all genuinely trying to make conditions better, he said, but the pace of operations does not allow for real training.\nHe described scenarios in which sailors would \u201cjust have this scared, hopeless look in their eyes telling us they didn\u2019t know what to do\u201d when systems were down.\n\u201cI felt like no one knew what they were doing, and it scared me,\u201d he said.\nThe Navy has focused many of its efforts on improving the training for sailors. But some questioned whether the Navy has gone far enough.\nPaul Kenney, a midshipman who happened to be training on board the Fitzgerald on the night of the collision, recently wrote that the Navy needed a \u201clarge scale transformation\u201d in schooling surface warfare officers, known as SWOs, the backbone of the Navy\u2019s fighting force.\nAfter years of cutbacks, the Navy has begun implementing increased classroom time and more frequent assessments of officers\u2019 navigation skills. In the McCain collision, in particular, the sailors on the bridge were unfamiliar with the ship\u2019s navigation system and fumbled with its controls before the crash. The Navy has pledged to build better simulators. This month, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer announced plans to radically restructure the Navy\u2019s educational system.\nOne change since the collisions that struck sailors as especially grim came not from any formal Navy reforms, but from the commanders of the ships they serve on. Commanding officers used to assign sailors with similar jobs to the same sleeping quarters. But in the McCain crash, 10 men, the majority electronics experts, drowned in the same berthing area.\nNow, some commanding officers make sure that sailors with the same skills are not concentrated in any one sleeping compartment. That way, future collisions will be less likely to wipe out an entire skillset on board.\n\u201cI get that, but that\u2019s our solution?\u201d one sailor said. \u201cIt\u2019s safer for the Navy, but not for us.\u201d",

Watch the premiere on PBS on Feb. 26 at 10 p.m. Eastern, 9 p.m. Central and online at <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/frontline/\">pbs.org/frontline</a>.</p> </aside>\n<p>The landmark ruling had grown out of a <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/ref/nyregion/BROKEN_HOMES.html?module=inline\">2002 Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation</a> in The New York Times, which exposed the group homes as centers of neglect and abuse. Advocates sued. Ultimately, U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis ordered the state to offer adult home residents the opportunity to transition into their own apartments under a system called supported housing. The idea was to give people enough help to make it on their own without being overly intrusive.</p>\n<p>To get a sense of how the existing system worked, I began visiting adult homes, including Oceanview Manor on Coney Island. In the time I spent there, two people died; one resident slashed another with a knife; the police were a frequent presence. I could see that residents lived in boredom and squalor, with little in the way of therapeutic services. Some ate from trash cans. Others begged for change. They complained of predation and thievery. Some had been there decades.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/in-a-lonely-corner-of-coney-island-a-fight-over-care-for-the-vulnerable\">wrote</a> what I saw, and then I kept digging.</p>\n<aside> <h3>Get Our Top Investigations</h3> <p>Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.</p>  </aside>\n<p>I started to hear stories of those struggling in their new apartments, almost completely out of sight from the state. An independent court monitor appointed to oversee the transition had noted in his reports that the state failed to track bad outcomes for those who had moved out of adult homes. While the monitor said many in supported housing were doing well, he recounted cases of some who were not. My editor, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/people/alexandra-zayas\">Alexandra Zayas</a>, and I found the anecdotes alarming, both in the depth of the despair and the lack of involvement by state and social service agencies.</p>\n<p>One woman stopped taking her medication, began soliciting sex from passing cars, swapped alcohol for drugs with neighborhood children and ultimately became homeless. We began thinking about how to assess the extent of the problem. If the government wasn&rsquo;t tracking it, <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/supported-housing/new-york-mentally-ill-housing-group-homes/\">maybe we could</a>.</p>\n<p>Our quest, captured in a <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/right-to-fail/\">PBS Frontline documentary</a> that airs tonight at 10 p.m. E.S.T., led us into a kind of journalistic and ethical minefield, fraught with questions about consent, privacy, civil rights and the future of care for a population made a perennial promise of a better life that too often falls short.</p>\n<p>Here is how we navigated them, for three of the men whose stories appear in the documentary.</p>\n<h3>Nestor Bunch</h3>\n<figure data-pp-blocktype=\"image\" data-pp-id=\"7\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 457px, (min-width: 780px) calc(24.46vw + 41px), (min-width: 600px) 27.5vw, 43.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190226-frontline-documentary-nestor-alternate.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190226-frontline-documentary-nestor-alternate.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190226-frontline-documentary-nestor-alternate.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190226-frontline-documentary-nestor-alternate.jpg 1600w\"></img><figcaption>Nestor Bunch (George Etheredge, special to ProPublica) </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Early on, I heard about a man with schizophrenia whose experience in supported housing reflected its biggest shortcomings. He was described to me as almost childlike in his naivete, unable to care for himself. At first, I had only a pair of initials to go on &mdash; the wrong ones. Eventually, I learned his name was <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/supported-housing/new-york-mentally-ill-supported-housing-nestor-bunch/\">Nestor Bunch</a>.</p>\n<p>People with severe mental illness can be difficult to track: some wind up on the street or in psychiatric hospitals; phone numbers often change. After a series of dead ends, I was elated when I found Bunch &mdash; until I realized he could not reliably narrate his own life. As he jumbled the timeline of his addresses and experiences, it became clear he had a traumatic story to tell. It involved finding his first roommate naked and dead, landing in the hospital with a serious injury and being sent to the trash-strewed apartment of another roommate who died.</p>\n<p>By that point, I had partnered with Tom Jennings, a producer with Frontline. We knew that if we were going to tell Bunch&rsquo;s story, we would need to find sources who could speak to his experience and obtain the records that documented their accounts.</p>\n<p>This raised a thorny question we would have to confront again and again. Medical records are private, for good reason; mental health records, even more so. Bunch would have to sign them over to us. Could we reasonably expect him to make a coherent decision about releasing such personal information?</p>\n<p>After many long discussions, Jennings, Zayas and I decided it was imperative that we collect such documents; that we explain to Bunch in the clearest possible terms why we were doing so; and that we get them from as many entities as we could.</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"9\">   <figure><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/supported-housing/new-york-mentally-ill-supported-housing-nestor-bunch/\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 335px, (min-width: 960px) calc(18.38vw + 23px), (min-width: 780px) 18.75vw, (min-width: 600px) 27.5vw, 43.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo1200w/20181213-supported-housing-nestor-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo400w/20181213-supported-housing-nestor-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo800w/20181213-supported-housing-nestor-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/externals/_threeTwo1200w/20181213-supported-housing-nestor-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/supported-housing/new-york-mentally-ill-supported-housing-nestor-bunch/\">After Years in Institutions, a Road Home Paved With Hunger, Violence and Death</a></figcaption></figure>    </aside>\n<p>While it was true that Bunch and his peers could be prone to delusions, hallucinations and mania, the state had decided that they could choose for themselves where and how they wanted to live. It seemed fair that they should also be able to make decisions about who could see their records. We consulted veteran mental health reporter Meg Kissinger, who teaches at the Columbia University School of Journalism. She urged us to let our subjects tell their own stories, in their own words; this included sharing records if they agreed.</p>\n<p>In Bunch&rsquo;s case, we were fortunate to notice a Christmas card in his room with the return address of Nora Weinerth, a family friend. She told us the remarkable story of his late mother, a grassroots mental health advocate who fought for independent living. Weinerth felt strongly that sharing Bunch&rsquo;s story would help fulfill his mother&rsquo;s wish to destigmatize the plight of people with mental illness.</p>\n<p>And so we began the long process of asking Bunch to fill out release forms, often getting them notarized, and taking them to entities that cared for him: hospitals, his former adult home, the nonprofits charged with his care, government agencies, his therapist. The records opened a window to Bunch&rsquo;s world we otherwise never would have seen.</p>\n<p>They showed that he struggled, at one point attempting to gouge out his eyes. The records showed he was often hungry and could not keep his refrigerator stocked. They described, in great detail, how he was hospitalized for injuries so severe, doctors suspected an assault. They showed that his caregivers repeatedly said he needed more help than was available in supported housing, but he stayed in it anyway.</p>\n<h3>Bernard Walker</h3>\n<figure data-pp-blocktype=\"image\" data-pp-id=\"11\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 826px, (min-width: 780px) calc(46.09vw + 43px), (min-width: 600px) 59.38vw, 93.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20190226-frontline-documentary-bernard-horizontal.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190226-frontline-documentary-bernard-horizontal.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190226-frontline-documentary-bernard-horizontal.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190226-frontline-documentary-bernard-horizontal.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20190226-frontline-documentary-bernard-horizontal.jpg 2000w\"></img><figcaption>Rosetta Walker holds photos of her son, Bernard.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>We realized Bunch&rsquo;s roommates were equally important, particularly Bernard Walker, who died during a blizzard a few weeks after the two had moved in together.</p>\n<p>To understand Walker&rsquo;s story and get his records, we would need to find and gain the trust of his family. Our first break in that effort came when Jennings and I visited a source in a New York housing project who had worked with residents. Just before we arrived, the source threw a box full of records into the trash chute.</p>\n<p>With his permission, we spoke with a maintenance worker, who opened up the trash compactor, found the garbage bag and allowed us to rummage through it. Mixed in with the dirty diapers and plastic foam takeout trays, we found a spreadsheet that contained Walker&rsquo;s Social Security number. We used that to find his next of kin.</p>\n<p>I went to the home where he had grown up, just south of Prospect Park in Brooklyn, and met his brother Michael, a former New York City police officer who was also looking for answers about Walker&rsquo;s death. Together, we obtained the autopsy from the medical examiner&rsquo;s office and the police report.</p>\n<figure data-pp-blocktype=\"image\" data-pp-id=\"13\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 457px, (min-width: 780px) calc(24.46vw + 41px), (min-width: 600px) 27.5vw, 43.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190226-frontline-documentary-rosetta.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190226-frontline-documentary-rosetta.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190226-frontline-documentary-rosetta.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190226-frontline-documentary-rosetta.jpg 1600w\"></img><figcaption>Rosetta Walker (George Etheredge, special to ProPublica) </figcaption></figure>\n<p>His mother, Rosetta Walker, agreed to help us obtain her son&rsquo;s medical records. She filled out countless release forms and notarized requests. The nonprofit Federation of Organizations, which was supposed to help Walker with his medical care, held out. Its compliance officer told us that it would only fulfill a request from someone we could prove was responsible for Walker&rsquo;s health care decisions while he was still alive.</p>\n<p>Rosetta Walker agreed to become the voluntary administrator of his estate. She had to go through a proceeding at Kings County Surrogate Court, which required her to fill out a notarized affidavit and provide proof of payment for her son&rsquo;s funeral expenses and an official copy of his death certificate.</p>\n<p>Federation finally sent records to her this month. These and other records showed that Walker had been inconsistent in taking his medication, that he asked for more help and that a Federation worker had visited him two days before his death to check his pillboxes and watch him pack his medicine.</p>\n<p>We learned that the state conducted an investigation into Walker&rsquo;s death. But even with all the work the Walker family put into obtaining the results, neither the Department of Health nor the Office of Mental Health would disclose it. In response to Freedom of Information Law requests, the state agencies said that such records would &ldquo;constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy&rdquo; and that because they are &ldquo;quality assurance records,&rdquo; they are shielded by state law.</p>\n<p>Even after presenting the voluntary administrator certificate, the family was still refused. It is not lost on them that the same law that protects Walker&rsquo;s privacy in death is now being used to shield from public view the actions of the state agencies that oversaw his care.</p>\n<h3>Abraham Clemente</h3>\n<figure data-pp-blocktype=\"image\" data-pp-id=\"15\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 457px, (min-width: 780px) calc(24.46vw + 41px), (min-width: 600px) 27.5vw, 43.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190226-frontline-documentary-abraham.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190226-frontline-documentary-abraham.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190226-frontline-documentary-abraham.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190226-frontline-documentary-abraham.jpg 1600w\"></img><figcaption>(George Etheredge, special to ProPublica)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Last summer, we began to widen our reporting beyond the experiences of Bunch and his roommates. We soon found Abraham Clemente, a 69-year-old man with schizophrenia who had spent most of his life behind bars and in institutions. We were <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/supported-housing/new-york-mentally-ill-housing-group-homes/\">stunned by the state of his apartment</a>. It was alive with insects and reeked of spoiled food and feces. Sometimes he told us he was living this way by choice; other times, he said he was miserable and lonely and wanted help.</p>\n<p>The question of consent arose again. Could he coherently agree to allow us to film him?</p>\n<p>Once again, we decided the answer was yes.</p>\n<p>In this case, Clemente almost always invited us into his apartment, no matter his temperament that day or presentation. He assured us that he understood what we were there to do, and we asked his permission every time, just in case. There were concerns from his neighbors, who worried that he was not getting enough help and that they might suffer for it. He had started two fires in his apartment.</p>\n<p>We began to wonder what might happen if we chose <em>not</em> to tell Clemente&rsquo;s story.</p>\n<p>Clemente, too, decided to share his records with us.</p>\n<p>They were as revealing as Bunch&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>The company that had been managing his health care at the adult home warned that he was not interested in learning how to administer his own medication: &ldquo;At this time, we cannot safely provide service to this member in a supported apartment,&rdquo; a registered nurse for the company wrote. But state officials decided he could be moved to supported housing. A care coordinator told the police he tried to hit her after being off his medication for five days. An aide quit because she was &ldquo;in fear of her life,&rdquo; records show.</p>\n<p>Clemente remained in supported housing until the fall, when he made it back to his adult home, convinced that he had a job there as a security guard and that residents owed him money. An ambulance was called, taking him to an emergency room, where he got into a physical altercation and wound up in a psychiatric ward. Finally, on Nov. 1, he moved back to the adult home.</p>\n<p>In our meetings since, Clemente has thanked us. He acknowledged that he was struggling on his own, that he needed more help. Slowly, he is beginning to consider another attempt at independence.</p>",

                "text": "In early 2017, I received a tip that the New York State Department of Health was trying to evade a federal court order that required officials to move thousands of people with mental illness out of troubled adult homes and into their own apartments.\nProPublica and Frontline investigate the effort to let those with severe mental illnesses live on their own. Watch the premiere on PBS on Feb. 26 at 10 p.m. Eastern, 9 p.m. Central and online at pbs.org/frontline.\nThe landmark ruling had grown out of a 2002 Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation in The New York Times, which exposed the group homes as centers of neglect and abuse. Advocates sued. Ultimately, U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis ordered the state to offer adult home residents the opportunity to transition into their own apartments under a system called supported housing. The idea was to give people enough help to make it on their own without being overly intrusive.\nTo get a sense of how the existing system worked, I began visiting adult homes, including Oceanview Manor on Coney Island. In the time I spent there, two people died; one resident slashed another with a knife; the police were a frequent presence. I could see that residents lived in boredom and squalor, with little in the way of therapeutic services. Some ate from trash cans. Others begged for change. They complained of predation and thievery. Some had been there decades.\nI wrote what I saw, and then I kept digging.\nGet Our Top Investigations\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\nI started to hear stories of those struggling in their new apartments, almost completely out of sight from the state. An independent court monitor appointed to oversee the transition had noted in his reports that the state failed to track bad outcomes for those who had moved out of adult homes. While the monitor said many in supported housing were doing well, he recounted cases of some who were not. My editor, Alexandra Zayas, and I found the anecdotes alarming, both in the depth of the despair and the lack of involvement by state and social service agencies.\nOne woman stopped taking her medication, began soliciting sex from passing cars, swapped alcohol for drugs with neighborhood children and ultimately became homeless. We began thinking about how to assess the extent of the problem. If the government wasn\u2019t tracking it, maybe we could.\nOur quest, captured in a PBS Frontline documentary that airs tonight at 10 p.m. E.S.T., led us into a kind of journalistic and ethical minefield, fraught with questions about consent, privacy, civil rights and the future of care for a population made a perennial promise of a better life that too often falls short.\nHere is how we navigated them, for three of the men whose stories appear in the documentary.\nNestor Bunch\nEarly on, I heard about a man with schizophrenia whose experience in supported housing reflected its biggest shortcomings. He was described to me as almost childlike in his naivete, unable to care for himself. At first, I had only a pair of initials to go on \u2014 the wrong ones. Eventually, I learned his name was Nestor Bunch.\nPeople with severe mental illness can be difficult to track: some wind up on the street or in psychiatric hospitals; phone numbers often change. After a series of dead ends, I was elated when I found Bunch \u2014 until I realized he could not reliably narrate his own life. As he jumbled the timeline of his addresses and experiences, it became clear he had a traumatic story to tell. It involved finding his first roommate naked and dead, landing in the hospital with a serious injury and being sent to the trash-strewed apartment of another roommate who died.\nBy that point, I had partnered with Tom Jennings, a producer with Frontline. We knew that if we were going to tell Bunch\u2019s story, we would need to find sources who could speak to his experience and obtain the records that documented their accounts.\nThis raised a thorny question we would have to confront again and again. Medical records are private, for good reason; mental health records, even more so. Bunch would have to sign them over to us. Could we reasonably expect him to make a coherent decision about releasing such personal information?\nAfter many long discussions, Jennings, Zayas and I decided it was imperative that we collect such documents; that we explain to Bunch in the clearest possible terms why we were doing so; and that we get them from as many entities as we could.\nWhile it was true that Bunch and his peers could be prone to delusions, hallucinations and mania, the state had decided that they could choose for themselves where and how they wanted to live. It seemed fair that they should also be able to make decisions about who could see their records. We consulted veteran mental health reporter Meg Kissinger, who teaches at the Columbia University School of Journalism. She urged us to let our subjects tell their own stories, in their own words; this included sharing records if they agreed.\nIn Bunch\u2019s case, we were fortunate to notice a Christmas card in his room with the return address of Nora Weinerth, a family friend. She told us the remarkable story of his late mother, a grassroots mental health advocate who fought for independent living. Weinerth felt strongly that sharing Bunch\u2019s story would help fulfill his mother\u2019s wish to destigmatize the plight of people with mental illness.\nAnd so we began the long process of asking Bunch to fill out release forms, often getting them notarized, and taking them to entities that cared for him: hospitals, his former adult home, the nonprofits charged with his care, government agencies, his therapist. The records opened a window to Bunch\u2019s world we otherwise never would have seen.\nThey showed that he struggled, at one point attempting to gouge out his eyes. The records showed he was often hungry and could not keep his refrigerator stocked. They described, in great detail, how he was hospitalized for injuries so severe, doctors suspected an assault. They showed that his caregivers repeatedly said he needed more help than was available in supported housing, but he stayed in it anyway.\nBernard Walker\nWe realized Bunch\u2019s roommates were equally important, particularly Bernard Walker, who died during a blizzard a few weeks after the two had moved in together.\nTo understand Walker\u2019s story and get his records, we would need to find and gain the trust of his family. Our first break in that effort came when Jennings and I visited a source in a New York housing project who had worked with residents. Just before we arrived, the source threw a box full of records into the trash chute.\nWith his permission, we spoke with a maintenance worker, who opened up the trash compactor, found the garbage bag and allowed us to rummage through it. Mixed in with the dirty diapers and plastic foam takeout trays, we found a spreadsheet that contained Walker\u2019s Social Security number. We used that to find his next of kin.\nI went to the home where he had grown up, just south of Prospect Park in Brooklyn, and met his brother Michael, a former New York City police officer who was also looking for answers about Walker\u2019s death. Together, we obtained the autopsy from the medical examiner\u2019s office and the police report.\nHis mother, Rosetta Walker, agreed to help us obtain her son\u2019s medical records. She filled out countless release forms and notarized requests. The nonprofit Federation of Organizations, which was supposed to help Walker with his medical care, held out. Its compliance officer told us that it would only fulfill a request from someone we could prove was responsible for Walker\u2019s health care decisions while he was still alive.\nRosetta Walker agreed to become the voluntary administrator of his estate. She had to go through a proceeding at Kings County Surrogate Court, which required her to fill out a notarized affidavit and provide proof of payment for her son\u2019s funeral expenses and an official copy of his death certificate.\nFederation finally sent records to her this month. These and other records showed that Walker had been inconsistent in taking his medication, that he asked for more help and that a Federation worker had visited him two days before his death to check his pillboxes and watch him pack his medicine.\nWe learned that the state conducted an investigation into Walker\u2019s death. But even with all the work the Walker family put into obtaining the results, neither the Department of Health nor the Office of Mental Health would disclose it. In response to Freedom of Information Law requests, the state agencies said that such records would \u201cconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d and that because they are \u201cquality assurance records,\u201d they are shielded by state law.\nEven after presenting the voluntary administrator certificate, the family was still refused. It is not lost on them that the same law that protects Walker\u2019s privacy in death is now being used to shield from public view the actions of the state agencies that oversaw his care.\nAbraham Clemente\nLast summer, we began to widen our reporting beyond the experiences of Bunch and his roommates. We soon found Abraham Clemente, a 69-year-old man with schizophrenia who had spent most of his life behind bars and in institutions. We were stunned by the state of his apartment. It was alive with insects and reeked of spoiled food and feces. Sometimes he told us he was living this way by choice; other times, he said he was miserable and lonely and wanted help.\nThe question of consent arose again. Could he coherently agree to allow us to film him?\nOnce again, we decided the answer was yes.\nIn this case, Clemente almost always invited us into his apartment, no matter his temperament that day or presentation. He assured us that he understood what we were there to do, and we asked his permission every time, just in case. There were concerns from his neighbors, who worried that he was not getting enough help and that they might suffer for it. He had started two fires in his apartment.\nWe began to wonder what might happen if we chose not to tell Clemente\u2019s story.\nClemente, too, decided to share his records with us.\nThey were as revealing as Bunch\u2019s.\nThe company that had been managing his health care at the adult home warned that he was not interested in learning how to administer his own medication: \u201cAt this time, we cannot safely provide service to this member in a supported apartment,\u201d a registered nurse for the company wrote. But state officials decided he could be moved to supported housing. A care coordinator told the police he tried to hit her after being off his medication for five days. An aide quit because she was \u201cin fear of her life,\u201d records show.\nClemente remained in supported housing until the fall, when he made it back to his adult home, convinced that he had a job there as a security guard and that residents owed him money. An ambulance was called, taking him to an emergency room, where he got into a physical altercation and wound up in a psychiatric ward. Finally, on Nov. 1, he moved back to the adult home.\nIn our meetings since, Clemente has thanked us. He acknowledged that he was struggling on his own, that he needed more help. Slowly, he is beginning to consider another attempt at independence.",

Boyer had argued that their privacy should be protected. DCFS attorneys had also argued that ProPublica Illinois should not be allowed to identify the children.</p>\n<p>Martin barred ProPublica Illinois and other news organizations from publishing &ldquo;the names and/or any other information that would permit the ready identification&rdquo; of the children or the foster parents involved in a case ProPublica Illinois is investigating. That included &ldquo;specific address or other demographic information.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Martin&rsquo;s order was a rare instance of a judge restricting a news organization before the publication of a story, and it drew criticism from other journalists and media rights organizations.</p>\n<p>ProPublica Illinois told Martin that while it had no plans to identify the children in the case, the judge&rsquo;s order was too broad and shouldn&rsquo;t restrain the organization before publication. ProPublica Illinois reporters learned the identities of the children and foster parents independently and outside court hearings.</p>\n<p>Boyer said Monday that he is &ldquo;very respectful&rdquo; of the media&rsquo;s First Amendment rights. But as the guardian ad litem for the children in the case, &ldquo;I also have an obligation to do everything in my power to safeguard their best interests, and this includes defending the fundamental privacy rights of blameless children that the law says must be weighed in the balance.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A spokesman for DCFS, which had opposed ProPublica Illinois&rsquo; effort to lift the judge&rsquo;s order, declined to comment Monday.</p>\n<p>Forty news organizations, led by the <a href=\"https://www.rcfp.org/\">Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press</a>, a group that advocates for press rights, had submitted <a href=\"https://www.rcfp.org/40-media-organizations-argue-against-use-of-prior-restraint-on-the-press/\">a friend of the court letter</a> arguing that the judge had violated ProPublica Illinois&rsquo; First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>The judge&rsquo;s order, while an effort to protect the children&rsquo;s privacy, was &ldquo;an unconstitutional prior restraint&rdquo; and a &ldquo;direct attack on the marketplace of ideas,&rdquo; the letter said.

                "text": "A Cook County judge Monday lifted part of her previous order prohibiting ProPublica Illinois from publishing some details of a child welfare case it has been investigating, conceding that the restriction was \u201coverbroad.\u201d\nAt the same time, Patricia Martin, the presiding judge of the Cook County Juvenile Court\u2019s child protection division, continued to block the news organization from publishing the names or pictures of the minors involved in the case. While acknowledging the constitutional right of ProPublica Illinois to publish, the judge ruled that her restriction on disclosing the identities is necessary to protect the children.\nProPublica Illinois has a \u201cright to act as a conduit of information and to keep the public informed as to the workings of the court and the Illinois child welfare system,\u201d Martin wrote in her modified order. \u201cNevertheless, if ProPublica publishes the children\u2019s names or likenesses, it would be the actions of ProPublica, and ProPublica alone that would be responsible for inflicting a gratuitous harm on these children.\u201d\nAside from not revealing the identities of the minors, ProPublica \u201cis free to report on any aspect of these cases, DCFS [the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services], the court, or the Illinois child welfare system as a whole,\u201d Martin wrote.\nRichard Tofel, president of ProPublica, the parent organization of ProPublica Illinois, said in a statement: \u201cWhile there are significant aspects of Judge Martin\u2019s order and opinion with which we disagree, we are gratified that the order and opinion recognize our constitutional right to report on any aspect of these cases beyond the children\u2019s names. That reporting continues.\u201d\nProPublica Illinois had no plans to publish the names of the children in the child welfare case. But the First Amendment protects the right of the media to make decisions about what to publish without \u201cthe invasion of the power of the state into a newsroom,\u201d Gabriel Fuentes, an attorney with Jenner & Block representing ProPublica Illinois, argued in a April 5 hearing on the prior restraint order.\nMartin issued that order last month in response to a request from Bruce Boyer, a professor at Loyola University Chicago\u2019s law school and director of its Civitas ChildLaw Clinic, who represents the children involved in the case. Boyer had argued that their privacy should be protected. DCFS attorneys had also argued that ProPublica Illinois should not be allowed to identify the children.\nMartin barred ProPublica Illinois and other news organizations from publishing \u201cthe names and/or any other information that would permit the ready identification\u201d of the children or the foster parents involved in a case ProPublica Illinois is investigating. That included \u201cspecific address or other demographic information.\u201d\nMartin\u2019s order was a rare instance of a judge restricting a news organization before the publication of a story, and it drew criticism from other journalists and media rights organizations.\nProPublica Illinois told Martin that while it had no plans to identify the children in the case, the judge\u2019s order was too broad and shouldn\u2019t restrain the organization before publication. ProPublica Illinois reporters learned the identities of the children and foster parents independently and outside court hearings.\nBoyer said Monday that he is \u201cvery respectful\u201d of the media\u2019s First Amendment rights. But as the guardian ad litem for the children in the case, \u201cI also have an obligation to do everything in my power to safeguard their best interests, and this includes defending the fundamental privacy rights of blameless children that the law says must be weighed in the balance.\u201d\nA spokesman for DCFS, which had opposed ProPublica Illinois\u2019 effort to lift the judge\u2019s order, declined to comment Monday.\nForty news organizations, led by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a group that advocates for press rights, had submitted a friend of the court letter arguing that the judge had violated ProPublica Illinois\u2019 First Amendment rights.\nThe judge\u2019s order, while an effort to protect the children\u2019s privacy, was \u201can unconstitutional prior restraint\u201d and a \u201cdirect attack on the marketplace of ideas,\u201d the letter said. The letter was signed by news organizations that included Chicago\u2019s daily newspapers, NPR, The New York Times and The Washington Post.",

Her body was retaining too much fluid after a dialysis treatment, and she was in need of emergency medical care.</p>\n<p>What happened next could have killed her.</p>\n<p>Hospital staff put in a request to give the woman a blood transfusion, but the order was meant for another patient with a different blood type. Fortunately, the St. Luke&rsquo;s laboratory caught the error, sparing the woman from harm.</p>\n<p>Four days later, however, hospital staff committed a similar mistake, only this time workers in the lab didn&rsquo;t notice when a blood sample arrived with another patient&rsquo;s blood in it. As a result, a 75-year-old woman was given the wrong blood, mistaken for a patient who had been in her ER room immediately before her.</p>\n<p>She died the next day after repeated bouts of cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p>The fatal mistake followed a pattern of blood labeling errors at St. Luke&rsquo;s during the past year, according to a scathing report issued last month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and made public Tuesday by the hospital. The government report came after <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/series/heart-failure\">a yearlong investigation by the Houston Chronicle and ProPublica</a> that documented numerous lapses in patient care at a hospital once regarded as among the nation&rsquo;s best for cardiac care.</p>\n<aside>  <p>Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.</p>  </aside>\n<p>St. Luke&rsquo;s leaders released <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5758178-Baylor-St-Luke-s-statement-of-deficiencies.html\">the 99-page inspection report</a> on Tuesday, along with <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5758155-St-Luke-s-corrections.html\">a document detailing the hospital&rsquo;s efforts to correct the problems</a>. In <a href=\"https://www.chistlukeshealth.org/newsroom/open-letter-doug-lawson\">a letter posted on the hospital&rsquo;s website</a>, St. Luke&rsquo;s CEO Doug Lawson called the government&rsquo;s findings &ldquo;deeply disappointing.&rdquo; He also wrote that he expects regulators to find additional problems when they return to the hospital for a comprehensive audit of patient care practices in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Lawson said newly hired St. Luke&rsquo;s executives have already made several changes to bring the hospital into compliance with federal standards, including an improved training program to ensure blood samples are labeled properly. The hospital has also enhanced its quality improvement program, Lawson wrote, and officials have made it easier for staff to report patient safety concerns to senior leadership.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is our responsibility to learn from these mistakes, and we take this responsibility very seriously,&rdquo; Lawson wrote. &ldquo;An incident like this should never happen.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dr. Ashish Jha, an expert in hospital quality, reviewed the government&rsquo;s findings and said it appeared St. Luke&rsquo;s was struggling to meet basic care standards. The labeling mistakes, he said, seemed indicative of &ldquo;a broader systemic problem.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These are really basic errors that I didn&rsquo;t really think happened that often anymore,&rdquo; said Jha, who directs Harvard University&rsquo;s Global Health Institute.</p>\n<p>St. Luke&rsquo;s appeared to miss warning signs in the months prior to the deadly mistake, according to the government report.</p>\n<p>An internal hospital committee identified problems with the way staff had been labeling blood samples a year ago, according to the federal report, but the unsafe practices continued. In total, regulators identified 122 incidents from a recent four-month period, from September to January, in which St. Luke&rsquo;s staff made blood labeling errors, some more serious than others.</p>\n<p>These problems were compounded by a short-staffed nursing crew that lacked training in how to detect adverse reactions during transfusions and a hospital laboratory with too few workers on staff to always catch potentially fatal labeling mistakes, according to the government report.</p>\n<aside data-pp-blocktype=\"promo\" data-pp-id=\"4\">   <figure><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/as-st-lukes-heart-program-faltered-deaths-after-liver-and-lung-transplants-also-ticked-upward\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 335px, (min-width: 960px) calc(18.38vw + 23px), (min-width: 780px) 18.75vw, (min-width: 600px) 27.5vw, 43.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20181130-lung-liver-lead-crop-new-3x2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20181130-lung-liver-lead-crop-new-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20181130-lung-liver-lead-crop-new-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20181130-lung-liver-lead-crop-new-3x2.jpg 1200w\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/as-st-lukes-heart-program-faltered-deaths-after-liver-and-lung-transplants-also-ticked-upward\">As St. Luke&rsquo;s Heart Program Faltered, Deaths After Liver and Lung Transplants Also Ticked Upward</a></figcaption></figure>    <p>Some patients and family members who came to the Houston hospital for liver and lung transplants have complained about the quality of care provided. A St. Luke&rsquo;s spokeswoman says the transplant programs still meet national benchmarks and argues against focusing on outcomes from a single calendar year.</p>   </aside>\n<p>The violations are the latest in a series of setbacks for St. Luke&rsquo;s. The Medicare agency <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/st-lukes-heart-transplant-program-to-lose-medicare-funding-today\">cut off funding for heart transplants</a> at St. Luke&rsquo;s last year after the Chronicle-ProPublica investigation documented an outsized number of patient deaths and unusual surgical complications following the procedure in recent years.</p>\n<p>The news organizations also reported on poor outcomes following <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/st-lukes-heart-bypass-surgery-complications\">heart bypass surgery</a>, repeated complaints about inadequate nursing care, a recent rise in the number of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/as-st-lukes-heart-program-faltered-deaths-after-liver-and-lung-transplants-also-ticked-upward\">deaths after liver and lung transplants</a>, and a physician&rsquo;s lawsuit alleging that he was <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/st-lukes-doctor-faces-discipline-after-raising-patient-care-concerns\">retaliated against</a> after raising concerns that some of his patients had received unnecessary medical treatments in intensive care units.</p>\n<p>Hospital officials said repeatedly that problems identified by reporters had already been corrected, and they denied retaliating against the physician.</p>\n<p>After the botched blood transfusion, hospital leaders have taken a different tack. Days after the inspection, the hospital&rsquo;s board of directors announced it had <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/st.-lukes-in-houston-replaces-its-president-other-top-leaders-after-series-of-care-lapses-recent-deadly-error\">dismissed CEO Gay Nord and three other top executives</a>.</p>\n<p>The report released Tuesday details how the fatal mistake occurred.</p>\n<p>Medical staff had drawn blood from an ER patient on Dec. 2 but failed to discard the sample after that patient was discharged. The vial of blood was still in the hospital room when staff brought in a 75-year-old woman who had been rushed to St. Luke&rsquo;s by ambulance. When a doctor ordered a transfusion, staff mistakenly sent the tube containing the prior patient&rsquo;s blood sample, placing a new label over the original.</p>\n<p>Jha, the quality expert, said the double-labeling error was an egregious mistake, but with the proper checks in place, it shouldn&rsquo;t have led to the woman&rsquo;s death.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A lab should never accept a specimen that has two labels of two different patients,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Government inspectors found that the lab at St. Luke&rsquo;s did not have a policy on whether technicians should accept blood samples with multiple labels.</p>\n<p>The situation was made worse by poor nursing care, regulators wrote. Many nurses at St. Luke&rsquo;s had not been trained on how to identify signs of a blood transfusion gone wrong. Staff continued to give the 75-year-old woman the wrong blood despite a worsening adverse reaction, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The government report details numerous incidents in which St. Luke&rsquo;s nurses failed to track patient vital signs while administering transfusions, making it impossible to detect problems.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The findings present a likelihood that serious blood transfusion reactions may not be detected in an expeditious manner, which could delay appropriate response and treatment, and could result in death or injury to a patient,&rdquo; inspectors wrote.</p>\n<p>The hospital did not make changes in the weeks that followed, according to the report. In a meeting at St. Luke&rsquo;s on Jan. 10, more than a month after the death, hospital leaders acknowledged they still were not tracking labeling mistakes.</p>\n<p>The hospital has since hired several new officials to guide St. Luke&rsquo;s on its &ldquo;journey back to excellence,&rdquo; Lawson wrote in his letter Tuesday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is a challenging time for our hospital,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;While we cannot go back and change the past, we can focus our efforts on recreating the Baylor St. Luke&rsquo;s you have known and trusted.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mike Hixenbaugh is an investigative reporter at the Houston Chronicle.

                "text": "This article was produced in collaboration with the Houston Chronicle.\nSix days after Thanksgiving last year, a 73-year-old woman showed up at Baylor St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center in Houston. Her body was retaining too much fluid after a dialysis treatment, and she was in need of emergency medical care.\nWhat happened next could have killed her.\nHospital staff put in a request to give the woman a blood transfusion, but the order was meant for another patient with a different blood type. Fortunately, the St. Luke\u2019s laboratory caught the error, sparing the woman from harm.\nFour days later, however, hospital staff committed a similar mistake, only this time workers in the lab didn\u2019t notice when a blood sample arrived with another patient\u2019s blood in it. As a result, a 75-year-old woman was given the wrong blood, mistaken for a patient who had been in her ER room immediately before her.\nShe died the next day after repeated bouts of cardiac arrest.\nThe fatal mistake followed a pattern of blood labeling errors at St. Luke\u2019s during the past year, according to a scathing report issued last month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and made public Tuesday by the hospital. The government report came after a yearlong investigation by the Houston Chronicle and ProPublica that documented numerous lapses in patient care at a hospital once regarded as among the nation\u2019s best for cardiac care.\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\nSt. Luke\u2019s leaders released the 99-page inspection report on Tuesday, along with a document detailing the hospital\u2019s efforts to correct the problems. In a letter posted on the hospital\u2019s website, St. Luke\u2019s CEO Doug Lawson called the government\u2019s findings \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d He also wrote that he expects regulators to find additional problems when they return to the hospital for a comprehensive audit of patient care practices in the coming weeks.\nLawson said newly hired St. Luke\u2019s executives have already made several changes to bring the hospital into compliance with federal standards, including an improved training program to ensure blood samples are labeled properly. The hospital has also enhanced its quality improvement program, Lawson wrote, and officials have made it easier for staff to report patient safety concerns to senior leadership.\n\u201cIt is our responsibility to learn from these mistakes, and we take this responsibility very seriously,\u201d Lawson wrote. \u201cAn incident like this should never happen.\u201d\nDr. Ashish Jha, an expert in hospital quality, reviewed the government\u2019s findings and said it appeared St. Luke\u2019s was struggling to meet basic care standards. The labeling mistakes, he said, seemed indicative of \u201ca broader systemic problem.\u201d\n\u201cThese are really basic errors that I didn\u2019t really think happened that often anymore,\u201d said Jha, who directs Harvard University\u2019s Global Health Institute.\nSt. Luke\u2019s appeared to miss warning signs in the months prior to the deadly mistake, according to the government report.\nAn internal hospital committee identified problems with the way staff had been labeling blood samples a year ago, according to the federal report, but the unsafe practices continued. In total, regulators identified 122 incidents from a recent four-month period, from September to January, in which St. Luke\u2019s staff made blood labeling errors, some more serious than others.\nThese problems were compounded by a short-staffed nursing crew that lacked training in how to detect adverse reactions during transfusions and a hospital laboratory with too few workers on staff to always catch potentially fatal labeling mistakes, according to the government report.\nSome patients and family members who came to the Houston hospital for liver and lung transplants have complained about the quality of care provided. A St. Luke\u2019s spokeswoman says the transplant programs still meet national benchmarks and argues against focusing on outcomes from a single calendar year.\nThe violations are the latest in a series of setbacks for St. Luke\u2019s. The Medicare agency cut off funding for heart transplants at St. Luke\u2019s last year after the Chronicle-ProPublica investigation documented an outsized number of patient deaths and unusual surgical complications following the procedure in recent years.\nThe news organizations also reported on poor outcomes following heart bypass surgery, repeated complaints about inadequate nursing care, a recent rise in the number of deaths after liver and lung transplants, and a physician\u2019s lawsuit alleging that he was retaliated against after raising concerns that some of his patients had received unnecessary medical treatments in intensive care units.\nHospital officials said repeatedly that problems identified by reporters had already been corrected, and they denied retaliating against the physician.\nAfter the botched blood transfusion, hospital leaders have taken a different tack. Days after the inspection, the hospital\u2019s board of directors announced it had dismissed CEO Gay Nord and three other top executives.\nThe report released Tuesday details how the fatal mistake occurred.\nMedical staff had drawn blood from an ER patient on Dec. 2 but failed to discard the sample after that patient was discharged. The vial of blood was still in the hospital room when staff brought in a 75-year-old woman who had been rushed to St. Luke\u2019s by ambulance. When a doctor ordered a transfusion, staff mistakenly sent the tube containing the prior patient\u2019s blood sample, placing a new label over the original.\nJha, the quality expert, said the double-labeling error was an egregious mistake, but with the proper checks in place, it shouldn\u2019t have led to the woman\u2019s death.\n\u201cA lab should never accept a specimen that has two labels of two different patients,\u201d he said.\nGovernment inspectors found that the lab at St. Luke\u2019s did not have a policy on whether technicians should accept blood samples with multiple labels.\nThe situation was made worse by poor nursing care, regulators wrote. Many nurses at St. Luke\u2019s had not been trained on how to identify signs of a blood transfusion gone wrong. Staff continued to give the 75-year-old woman the wrong blood despite a worsening adverse reaction, according to the report.\nThe government report details numerous incidents in which St. Luke\u2019s nurses failed to track patient vital signs while administering transfusions, making it impossible to detect problems.\n\u201cThe findings present a likelihood that serious blood transfusion reactions may not be detected in an expeditious manner, which could delay appropriate response and treatment, and could result in death or injury to a patient,\u201d inspectors wrote.\nThe hospital did not make changes in the weeks that followed, according to the report. In a meeting at St. Luke\u2019s on Jan. 10, more than a month after the death, hospital leaders acknowledged they still were not tracking labeling mistakes.\nThe hospital has since hired several new officials to guide St. Luke\u2019s on its \u201cjourney back to excellence,\u201d Lawson wrote in his letter Tuesday.\n\u201cThis is a challenging time for our hospital,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile we cannot go back and change the past, we can focus our efforts on recreating the Baylor St. Luke\u2019s you have known and trusted.\u201d\nMike Hixenbaugh is an investigative reporter at the Houston Chronicle.

But these days, it also means people are asking <em>us</em> questions. One we hear a lot nowadays: &ldquo;When is the Mueller report coming &mdash; and what will it say?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Our answer: We don&rsquo;t know. But we&rsquo;ve realized that perhaps we can be more helpful than that. We don&rsquo;t have insider information on special counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s office. (Sorry!) But we have spent lots of time investigating the president and his businesses. And we thought we&rsquo;d share some of the perspectives we&rsquo;ve gained.</p>\n<p>Here are six things to keep in mind.</p>\n<figure data-pp-blocktype=\"audio\" data-pp-id=\"2\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.wnyc.org/widgets/ondemand_player/trumpinc/#file=/audio/json/919201/&share=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h3>1. Don&rsquo;t Predict.</h3>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t know what Mueller will report, when he will report it or even whether we&rsquo;ll be able to read it. That&rsquo;s because Congress changed the law after special prosecutor Kenneth Starr&rsquo;s salacious tell-all on President Bill Clinton. When Mueller is done, he has to give a report to Attorney General William Barr. But Barr can choose to keep the report confidential. Barr only has to give a summary to Congress. If Barr doesn&rsquo;t make Mueller&rsquo;s actual report public, Democrats will almost surely subpoena it. Then get ready for a fight.</p>\n<h3>2. Stop Focusing on &ldquo;Collusion.&rdquo;</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;Collusion&rdquo; has come to be a kind of shorthand for ... basically doing something bad with Russia. But the term is both too vague and too narrow. For one thing, &ldquo;collusion&rdquo; is not itself a clearly defined crime. It is a crime to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-923-18-usc-371-conspiracy-defraud-us\">commit</a> a conspiracy against the United States &mdash; for which there is a high bar: proving an <em>intent</em> to undermine the government.</p>\n<h3>3. Remember: We Already Know a Lot.</h3>\n<p>We already know Trump had a hidden conflict of interest involving Russia during the campaign. Despite publicly denying it, Trump was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/us/politics/trump-tower-moscow-cohen-giuliani.html\">negotiating</a> to develop a tower in Moscow while he was running for president. That means Trump had interests involving Russia &mdash; which voters didn&rsquo;t know about &mdash; that could have been influencing his policy positions. That&rsquo;s all problematic on its own.</p>\n<p>We also know that Russian government interests hacked the emails of the Democratic National Committee, handed them to Wikileaks, and that at least one Trump ally, Roger Stone, was in touch with Wikileaks.</p>\n<figure data-pp-blocktype=\"image\" data-pp-id=\"4\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 826px, (min-width: 780px) calc(46.09vw + 43px), (min-width: 600px) 59.38vw, 93.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20190304-mueller-report-stone.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190304-mueller-report-stone.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190304-mueller-report-stone.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190304-mueller-report-stone.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20190304-mueller-report-stone.jpg 2000w\"></img><figcaption>Roger Stone, former campaign adviser to Trump, leaves a district courthouse after a hearing on Feb. 21 in Washington, D.C.</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>4. Don&rsquo;t Expect Answers to Everything, or Even Most Things.</h3>\n<p>That&rsquo;s not Mueller&rsquo;s job. He is a prosecutor. His job is first and foremost to look for crimes. And while he can, and has, looked beyond Russian interference in the election, he&rsquo;s unlikely to dig into everything. And, of course, there are lots of areas worthy of scrutiny beyond Russia: Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/trump-inc-podcast/trump-family-business-panama-city-khafif/\">businesses</a>, his <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trumps-inauguration-paid-trumps-company-with-ivanka-in-the-middle\">inauguration</a>, his hush money payments and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kengude/status/1100888190540496897?s=21\">more</a>.</p>\n<h3>5. Mueller Is Not Alone.</h3>\n<p>There are <em>lots</em> of active investigations looking into all these issues. A partial rundown of just the ones we know about: Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating the inauguration and other matters, the New York attorney general is investigating the Trump Foundation, and the District of Columbia&rsquo;s attorney general and the state of Maryland are suing Trump over emoluments. There are also a whole host of coming congressional investigations.</p>\n<figure data-pp-blocktype=\"image\" data-pp-id=\"8\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 826px, (min-width: 780px) calc(46.09vw + 43px), (min-width: 600px) 59.38vw, 93.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20190304-mueller-report-inauguration.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190304-mueller-report-inauguration.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190304-mueller-report-inauguration.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190304-mueller-report-inauguration.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20190304-mueller-report-inauguration.jpg 2000w\"></img><figcaption>The Capitol during the presidential inaugural parade in January 2017.</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>6. The Final Judgments on Trump&rsquo;s Actions Will Be Political, Not Legal. (Caveats Apply.)</h3>\n<p>Whatever Mueller ultimately files, he is very unlikely to charge the president with a crime. Since Watergate, the Department of Justice has had a policy that a sitting president should <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-indictment-explainer/can-a-sitting-us-president-face-criminal-charges-idUSKCN1QF1D3\">not be indicted</a>. And Mueller is a stickler for the rules.</p>\n<p>Having said that, Trump does face significant <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kengude/status/1100888190540496897?s=21\">legal jeopardy</a>. For example, former presidents can be indicted. So can Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-trump-probe-looks-a-lot-like-a-rico-investigation?ref=scroll\">own company</a>.</p>\n<p>So: Stay tuned. Stay patient. And while you wait for the report, check out our conversation with &ldquo;On The Media&rdquo; &mdash; they&rsquo;ve <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/breaking-news-consumers-handbook-mueller-edition\">created a handy guide</a>.</p>\n<figure data-pp-blocktype=\"image\" data-pp-id=\"12\"><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1720px) 826px, (min-width: 780px) calc(46.09vw + 43px), (min-width: 600px) 59.38vw, 93.21vw\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20190304-mueller-report-trump.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190304-mueller-report-trump.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190304-mueller-report-trump.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190304-mueller-report-trump.jpg 1600w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20190304-mueller-report-trump.jpg 2000w\"></img><figcaption>Trump in the presidential limo in February.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Correction, March 7, 2019:</strong> This story originally misidentified which state is suing President Donald Trump over alleged emoluments violations.

But we\u2019ve realized that perhaps we can be more helpful than that. We don\u2019t have insider information on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office. (Sorry!) But we have spent lots of time investigating the president and his businesses. And we thought we\u2019d share some of the perspectives we\u2019ve gained.\nHere are six things to keep in mind.\n1. Don\u2019t Predict.\nWe don\u2019t know what Mueller will report, when he will report it or even whether we\u2019ll be able to read it. That\u2019s because Congress changed the law after special prosecutor Kenneth Starr\u2019s salacious tell-all on President Bill Clinton. When Mueller is done, he has to give a report to Attorney General William Barr. But Barr can choose to keep the report confidential. Barr only has to give a summary to Congress. If Barr doesn\u2019t make Mueller\u2019s actual report public, Democrats will almost surely subpoena it. Then get ready for a fight.\n2. Stop Focusing on \u201cCollusion.\u201d\n\u201cCollusion\u201d has come to be a kind of shorthand for ... basically doing something bad with Russia. But the term is both too vague and too narrow. For one thing, \u201ccollusion\u201d is not itself a clearly defined crime. It is a crime to commit a conspiracy against the United States \u2014 for which there is a high bar: proving an intent to undermine the government.\n3. Remember: We Already Know a Lot.\nWe already know Trump had a hidden conflict of interest involving Russia during the campaign. Despite publicly denying it, Trump was negotiating to develop a tower in Moscow while he was running for president. That means Trump had interests involving Russia \u2014 which voters didn\u2019t know about \u2014 that could have been influencing his policy positions. That\u2019s all problematic on its own.\nWe also know that Russian government interests hacked the emails of the Democratic National Committee, handed them to Wikileaks, and that at least one Trump ally, Roger Stone, was in touch with Wikileaks.\n4. Don\u2019t Expect Answers to Everything, or Even Most Things.\nThat\u2019s not Mueller\u2019s job. He is a prosecutor. His job is first and foremost to look for crimes. And while he can, and has, looked beyond Russian interference in the election, he\u2019s unlikely to dig into everything. And, of course, there are lots of areas worthy of scrutiny beyond Russia: Trump\u2019s businesses, his inauguration, his hush money payments and more.\n5. Mueller Is Not Alone.\nThere are lots of active investigations looking into all these issues. A partial rundown of just the ones we know about: Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating the inauguration and other matters, the New York attorney general is investigating the Trump Foundation, and the District of Columbia\u2019s attorney general and the state of Maryland are suing Trump over emoluments. There are also a whole host of coming congressional investigations.\n6. The Final Judgments on Trump\u2019s Actions Will Be Political, Not Legal. (Caveats Apply.)\nWhatever Mueller ultimately files, he is very unlikely to charge the president with a crime. Since Watergate, the Department of Justice has had a policy that a sitting president should not be indicted. And Mueller is a stickler for the rules.\nHaving said that, Trump does face significant legal jeopardy. For example, former presidents can be indicted. So can Trump\u2019s own company.\nSo: Stay tuned. Stay patient. And while you wait for the report, check out our conversation with \u201cOn The Media\u201d \u2014 they\u2019ve created a handy guide.\nCorrection, March 7, 2019: This story originally misidentified which state is suing President Donald Trump over alleged emoluments violations. It is Maryland, not Virginia.",

And almost every time she steps out of an airport body scanner, security screeners pull her aside and run their fingers through her hair. It&rsquo;s called a hair pat-down.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It happens with my natural Afro, when I have braids or two-strand twists. Regardless,&rdquo; said Wanzer, who lives in Washington, D.C. &ldquo;At this point in my life I have come to expect it, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it any less invasive and frustrating.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Wanzer, who had her hair patted down by Transportation Security Administration officers two weeks ago while she flew home from Raleigh, North Carolina, said she feels singled out when she is asked to step aside.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When you find yourself in that kind of situation, it makes you wonder,&rdquo; Wanzer said. &ldquo;Is this for security, or am I being profiled for my race?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Black women have been <a href=\"https://travelnoire.com/black-women-share-how-tsa-still-messes-with-your-hair-when-going-through-security/\">raising alarms</a> for years about being forced to undergo intrusive, degrading <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a18666534/tsa-black-women-hair-searches/\">searches</a> of their hair at airport security checkpoints. After a complaint five years ago, the TSA pledged to improve oversight and training for its workers on hair pat-downs.</p>\n<p>But it turns out there&rsquo;s an issue beyond the screeners: the machines themselves.</p>\n<p>The futuristic full-body scanners that have become standard at airports across the United States are prone to false alarms for hairstyles popular among women of color.</p>\n<p>In a request to <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index.php?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=7f581e20fe1e865a60437d733c14992b&tab=core&tabmode=list&=\">vendors</a> last summer, the TSA asked for ideas &ldquo;to improve screening of headwear and hair in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/fcs/TitleVI\">That law</a> bars federally funded agencies and programs from discriminating &mdash; even unintentionally &mdash; on the basis of race, color or national origin.</p>\n<p>Two officers interviewed by ProPublica said the machines&rsquo; alarms are frequently triggered by certain hairstyles.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With black females, the scanner alarms more because they have thicker hair; many times they have braids or dreadlocks,&rdquo; said a TSA officer who works at an airport in Texas and asked not to be named. &ldquo;Maybe, down the line, they will be redesigning the technology, so it can tell apart what&rsquo;s a real threat and what is not. But, for now, we officers have to do what the machine can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A government <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/670/662146.pdf\">report</a> in 2014 found that the machines also &ldquo;had a higher false alarm rate when passengers wore turbans and wigs.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside>  <p>Get ProPublica&rsquo;s Daily Digest.</p>  </aside>\n<p>Asked about the false alarms, the TSA said in a statement to ProPublica that the agency &ldquo;is reviewing additional options for the screening of hair.&rdquo; (Read the agency&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5923912-Statement-From-TSA-About-Hair-Pat-Downs.html\">full statement</a>.)</p>\n<p>A senior TSA official said in an interview that hair pat-downs are not discriminatory and are done when a body scanner indicates that a passenger has an object in his or her hair. &ldquo;I get a hair pat-down every time I travel. I&rsquo;m a white woman,&rdquo; said the official, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that she not be named.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Procedures require that if there is an alarm on the technology, the pat-down [must] be conducted,&rdquo; the official said. She added that the agency has found no evidence of discrimination in hair pat-downs or any pattern that pointed to a particular airport.</p>\n<p>The TSA advises passengers to remove all items from their hair before going through airport security and <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/blog/2018/10/09/tsa-travel-tips-hair-products-and-pat-downs-what-know-and-what-expect\">warns</a> on its website that &ldquo;wearing a hairpiece, extensions or a wig as well as a ponytail, a hair bun or braids&rdquo; may trigger an alarm.</p>\n<p>The TSA would not say if it had ever found a weapon in a passenger&rsquo;s hair. Its <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/blog/2016/04/21/asktsa-travel-tips-over-140-characters-hair-pat-downs\">website</a> says: &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised what can be hidden in hair. The most notable things we&rsquo;re looking for in hair are explosives and improvised explosives device components.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The false alarms affect more than the passengers whose hair is searched. The government report from 2014 noted that patting down passengers slows security lines and may increase costs by requiring extra screeners.</p>\n<p>Full-body scanners &mdash; millimeter wave machines &mdash; have become standard at airports over the past decade. The TSA accelerated their installation after failed &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/us/politics/anwar-awlaki-underwear-bomber-abdulmutallab.html\">underwear bomber</a>&rdquo; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab boarded a flight on Christmas Day 2009 from Amsterdam to Detroit with plastic explosives inside his pants.</p>\n<p>The scanners are made by L3 Technologies. A government <a href=\"https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/Mgmt/2013/OIG_13-120_Mar14.pdf\">report</a> said they cost about $150,000 each, and that the TSA spent more than $100 million deploying the machines. An L3 spokesperson declined to comment on the machines, and pointed us to the company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.sds.l3t.com/applications/advanced-people-screening.htm\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>Unlike metal detectors, the scanners can detect nonmetallic items. But they can&rsquo;t tell what objects are &mdash; or, apparently, if it&rsquo;s just thick hair. That requires humans.</p>\n<p>Last month, ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/have-tsa-agents-searched-your-hair-in-airport-security-lines-tell-us\">asked people</a> to share their experience with hair searches at airports. We received 720 responses. More than 90% were from women. Of the respondents overall, 313 identified as white only, 311 as black only and 96 as other ethnicities such as Latino, Asian American, Middle Eastern, American Indian or Alaskan Native, or mixed.</p>\n<p>Most black women and other women of color we heard from described the hair pat-downs as intrusive and disrespectful. They said they felt singled out during the process.</p>\n<figure data-pp-blocktype=\"image\" data-pp-id=\"4\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190417-dorian-vertical.jpg\" srcset=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20190417-dorian-vertical.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20190417-dorian-vertical.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20190417-dorian-vertical.jpg 1600w\"></img><figcaption>Wanzer, who lives in Washington, D.C.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;I get TSA workers have a job to do, which is to keep us safe,&rdquo; said Wanzer, the Washington, D.C., resident who frequently has her hair searched. &ldquo;But there needs to be a level of sensitivity about how different people perceive these kinds of searches.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Black women have long been discriminated against for wearing their hair as it grows naturally or for <a href=\"https://time.com/3107647/military-black-hairstyles/\">sporting hairstyles</a> mostly associated with black culture, like braids, two-strand twists, cornrows and locks. Natural black hair has been deemed unhygienic, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/style/hair-discrimination-new-york-city.html\">unprofessional</a> and radical, and it has been <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ethnography/aah/aaheritage/FrenchAmA.htm\">policed for centuries</a>.</p>\n<p>Most white women we heard from said they didn&rsquo;t mind the searches or considered them a minor annoyance.</p>\n<p>Toni Moss, who is white, said she travels by plane about four times a month. Moss said she is occasionally flagged for a hair search. The searches happen only when she keeps her short, voluminous hair in its naturally curly state. When Moss straightens her hair before traveling, she doesn&rsquo;t get a hair pat-down, she said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t really something that I mind. I just find it funny when it happens but, then, it doesn&rsquo;t happen every time I travel,&rdquo; said Moss, whose hair was searched most recently in January while going through security at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The last time it happened I was joking with TSA [officers],&rdquo; Moss said. &ldquo;I told them, &lsquo;Sorry you didn&rsquo;t find a pork chop in my head.&rsquo; And they laughed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/blog/2016/04/21/asktsa-travel-tips-over-140-characters-hair-pat-downs\">agency has said</a> that even if the machines don&rsquo;t sound an alarm, agents can still choose to do hair pat-downs if &ldquo;an individual&rsquo;s hair looks like it could contain a prohibited item or is styled in a way an officer cannot visually clear it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That discretion enables profiling, said Abre&rsquo; Conner, a lawyer with the ACLU of Northern California, which filed the <a href=\"https://www.aclunc.org/sites/default/files/2014.04.03%20ACLU%20Complaint%20Ltr%20to%20K.Walton%20re%20M.Singleton%20%28with%20Attach.A%29_redacted.pdf\">complaint</a> against the TSA in April 2014. &ldquo;When that discretion comes into play, unless there is explicit- and implicit-bias training, that can play out in a way that harms people of color, black people,&rdquo; Conner said.</p>\n<p>When Jazzmen Knoderer traveled by plane for the second time in her life, in 2012, TSA officers at Dayton International Airport in Ohio asked her to step aside for a full-body pat-down. It happened again the next time she took an airplane and went through security, at an airport on the Hawaiian island of Maui in 2013. And again, for her fourth plane trip in 2014, at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport.</p>\n<p>The first time Knoderer&rsquo;s hair was searched, it was short and styled in two-strand twists. The second time, she had an Afro. The third time, her Afro was no more than 3 inches long, she said.</p>\n<p>Knoderer said she didn&rsquo;t go through a body scanner or metal detector before she was searched.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t feel random when it happens three times in a row. It doesn&rsquo;t feel random when you see that all the people around you, who don&rsquo;t look like you, aren&rsquo;t asked to step aside,&rdquo; Knoderer said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to change the way my hair grows out of my head.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The number of complaints filed with the TSA by passengers alleging racial discrimination in hair pat-downs rose from 73 in 2017 to 105 in 2018.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not clear what has caused that increase. One reason may be growing scrutiny of the issue, in particular a <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a18666534/tsa-black-women-hair-searches/\">powerful story in Cosmopolitan</a> last year in which the writer recounted her own experiences and those of others. Most people we heard from said they had not known they could file a complaint.</p>\n<p>The TSA is one of the most diverse agencies in the federal government. One-quarter of the nation&rsquo;s 46,000 airport screeners are black and 23% are Hispanic, according to Office of Personnel Management data.</p>\n<p>Conner, the ACLU lawyer, said black airport screeners seem just as likely to conduct hair pat-downs as white screeners. The only difference is that a black screener &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t necessarily leave my hair as messed up,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p><em>Thomas Frank is a journalist in Washington, D.C., and was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2012.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Filed under:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/topics/civil-rights\">Civil Rights</a></li> </ul>",

Sign up to receive our best stories as soon as they\u2019re published.\nDorian Wanzer travels frequently for work. And almost every time she steps out of an airport body scanner, security screeners pull her aside and run their fingers through her hair. It\u2019s called a hair pat-down.\n\u201cIt happens with my natural Afro, when I have braids or two-strand twists. Regardless,\u201d said Wanzer, who lives in Washington, D.C. \u201cAt this point in my life I have come to expect it, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less invasive and frustrating.\u201d\nWanzer, who had her hair patted down by Transportation Security Administration officers two weeks ago while she flew home from Raleigh, North Carolina, said she feels singled out when she is asked to step aside.\n\u201cWhen you find yourself in that kind of situation, it makes you wonder,\u201d Wanzer said. \u201cIs this for security, or am I being profiled for my race?\u201d\nBlack women have been raising alarms for years about being forced to undergo intrusive, degrading searches of their hair at airport security checkpoints. After a complaint five years ago, the TSA pledged to improve oversight and training for its workers on hair pat-downs.\nBut it turns out there\u2019s an issue beyond the screeners: the machines themselves.\nThe futuristic full-body scanners that have become standard at airports across the United States are prone to false alarms for hairstyles popular among women of color.\nIn a request to vendors last summer, the TSA asked for ideas \u201cto improve screening of headwear and hair in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\u201d That law bars federally funded agencies and programs from discriminating \u2014 even unintentionally \u2014 on the basis of race, color or national origin.\nTwo officers interviewed by ProPublica said the machines\u2019 alarms are frequently triggered by certain hairstyles.\n\u201cWith black females, the scanner alarms more because they have thicker hair; many times they have braids or dreadlocks,\u201d said a TSA officer who works at an airport in Texas and asked not to be named. \u201cMaybe, down the line, they will be redesigning the technology, so it can tell apart what\u2019s a real threat and what is not. But, for now, we officers have to do what the machine can\u2019t.\u201d\nA government report in 2014 found that the machines also \u201chad a higher false alarm rate when passengers wore turbans and wigs.\u201d\nGet ProPublica\u2019s Daily Digest.\nAsked about the false alarms, the TSA said in a statement to ProPublica that the agency \u201cis reviewing additional options for the screening of hair.\u201d (Read the agency\u2019s full statement.)\nA senior TSA official said in an interview that hair pat-downs are not discriminatory and are done when a body scanner indicates that a passenger has an object in his or her hair. \u201cI get a hair pat-down every time I travel. I\u2019m a white woman,\u201d said the official, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that she not be named.\n\u201cProcedures require that if there is an alarm on the technology, the pat-down [must] be conducted,\u201d the official said. She added that the agency has found no evidence of discrimination in hair pat-downs or any pattern that pointed to a particular airport.\nThe TSA advises passengers to remove all items from their hair before going through airport security and warns on its website that \u201cwearing a hairpiece, extensions or a wig as well as a ponytail, a hair bun or braids\u201d may trigger an alarm.\nThe TSA would not say if it had ever found a weapon in a passenger\u2019s hair. Its website says: \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised what can be hidden in hair. The most notable things we\u2019re looking for in hair are explosives and improvised explosives device components.\u201d\nThe false alarms affect more than the passengers whose hair is searched. The government report from 2014 noted that patting down passengers slows security lines and may increase costs by requiring extra screeners.\nFull-body scanners \u2014 millimeter wave machines \u2014 have become standard at airports over the past decade. The TSA accelerated their installation after failed \u201cunderwear bomber\u201d Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab boarded a flight on Christmas Day 2009 from Amsterdam to Detroit with plastic explosives inside his pants.\nThe scanners are made by L3 Technologies. A government report said they cost about $150,000 each, and that the TSA spent more than $100 million deploying the machines. An L3 spokesperson declined to comment on the machines, and pointed us to the company\u2019s website.\nUnlike metal detectors, the scanners can detect nonmetallic items. But they can\u2019t tell what objects are \u2014 or, apparently, if it\u2019s just thick hair. That requires humans.\nLast month, ProPublica asked people to share their experience with hair searches at airports. We received 720 responses. More than 90% were from women. Of the respondents overall, 313 identified as white only, 311 as black only and 96 as other ethnicities such as Latino, Asian American, Middle Eastern, American Indian or Alaskan Native, or mixed.\nMost black women and other women of color we heard from described the hair pat-downs as intrusive and disrespectful. They said they felt singled out during the process.\n\u201cI get TSA workers have a job to do, which is to keep us safe,\u201d said Wanzer, the Washington, D.C., resident who frequently has her hair searched. \u201cBut there needs to be a level of sensitivity about how different people perceive these kinds of searches.\u201d\nBlack women have long been discriminated against for wearing their hair as it grows naturally or for sporting hairstyles mostly associated with black culture, like braids, two-strand twists, cornrows and locks. Natural black hair has been deemed unhygienic, unprofessional and radical, and it has been policed for centuries.\nMost white women we heard from said they didn\u2019t mind the searches or considered them a minor annoyance.\nToni Moss, who is white, said she travels by plane about four times a month. Moss said she is occasionally flagged for a hair search. The searches happen only when she keeps her short, voluminous hair in its naturally curly state. When Moss straightens her hair before traveling, she doesn\u2019t get a hair pat-down, she said.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t really something that I mind. I just find it funny when it happens but, then, it doesn\u2019t happen every time I travel,\u201d said Moss, whose hair was searched most recently in January while going through security at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas.\n\u201cThe last time it happened I was joking with TSA [officers],\u201d Moss said. \u201cI told them, \u2018Sorry you didn\u2019t find a pork chop in my head.\u2019 And they laughed.\u201d\nThe agency has said that even if the machines don\u2019t sound an alarm, agents can still choose to do hair pat-downs if \u201can individual\u2019s hair looks like it could contain a prohibited item or is styled in a way an officer cannot visually clear it.\u201d\nThat discretion enables profiling, said Abre\u2019 Conner, a lawyer with the ACLU of Northern California, which filed the complaint against the TSA in April 2014. \u201cWhen that discretion comes into play, unless there is explicit- and implicit-bias training, that can play out in a way that harms people of color, black people,\u201d Conner said.\nWhen Jazzmen Knoderer traveled by plane for the second time in her life, in 2012, TSA officers at Dayton International Airport in Ohio asked her to step aside for a full-body pat-down. It happened again the next time she took an airplane and went through security, at an airport on the Hawaiian island of Maui in 2013. And again, for her fourth plane trip in 2014, at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport.\nThe first time Knoderer\u2019s hair was searched, it was short and styled in two-strand twists. The second time, she had an Afro. The third time, her Afro was no more than 3 inches long, she said.\nKnoderer said she didn\u2019t go through a body scanner or metal detector before she was searched.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel random when it happens three times in a row. It doesn\u2019t feel random when you see that all the people around you, who don\u2019t look like you, aren\u2019t asked to step aside,\u201d Knoderer said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to change the way my hair grows out of my head.\u201d\nThe number of complaints filed with the TSA by passengers alleging racial discrimination in hair pat-downs rose from 73 in 2017 to 105 in 2018.\nIt\u2019s not clear what has caused that increase. One reason may be growing scrutiny of the issue, in particular a powerful story in Cosmopolitan last year in which the writer recounted her own experiences and those of others. Most people we heard from said they had not known they could file a complaint.\nThe TSA is one of the most diverse agencies in the federal government. One-quarter of the nation\u2019s 46,000 airport screeners are black and 23% are Hispanic, according to Office of Personnel Management data.\nConner, the ACLU lawyer, said black airport screeners seem just as likely to conduct hair pat-downs as white screeners. The only difference is that a black screener \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily leave my hair as messed up,\u201d she said.\nThomas Frank is a journalist in Washington, D.C., and was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2012.\nFiled under:\nCivil Rights",

The program is supposed to start in less than three months.</p>\n<p>The review was conducted by the U.S. Digital Service, an elite group of software developers and designers employed by the White House to help federal agencies improve their technology. The USDS team said the VA should scrap the eligibility tool and start over.</p>\n<p>The VA needs authorization from Congress to cover the $5.6 million cost of completing work on the eligibility tool, the department said in a March 4 <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5771115-MISSION-Act-IT-Transfer-3-4-19-Wasserman-Schultz.html\">letter</a> to a House appropriations subcommittee. The panel has not yet acted on the request.</p>\n<p>On Monday evening, shortly after this article was published House veterans affairs committee chairman Mark Takano <a href=\"https://veterans.house.gov/news/press-releases/chairman-takano-demands-answers-given-concerns-va-s-it-solutions-could-disrupt\">called</a> the findings by the USDS &ldquo;incredibly alarming&rdquo; and said his panel would hold a hearing to scrutinize the VA&rsquo;s funding request.</p>\n<p>VA spokesman Curt Cashour declined to comment on the USDS review, saying it &ldquo;remains a work in progress.&rdquo; The USDS didn&rsquo;t respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>The USDS report raised concerns that the eligibility tool was designed in a way that wouldn&rsquo;t work for VA doctors. The report predicted that the tool would generate errors or run slowly or crash. These glitches would lengthen each appointment by five to 10 minutes, the USDS team estimated, which equates to being able to treat 75,000 fewer veterans every day systemwide.</p>\n<p>The USDS said the contractor building the software &mdash; a Virginia-based company called AbleVets &mdash; is &ldquo;motivated and capable&rdquo;; the problem, according to the report, is the task that the VA assigned was rushed and poorly conceived. The tool has to pull data from six separate VA systems, but those connections won&rsquo;t be set up in time, the USDS found. There also won&rsquo;t be enough time to test the tool and address any errors, according to the report.</p>\n<p>Doctors could balk, interviews conducted by the USDS team indicated. As the leader of primary care physicians at one VA medical center said in the report, &ldquo;I will instruct every one of my PCPs not to do this.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Another unnamed physician said of administrators who expect doctors to use the tool: &ldquo;These people are out of their minds. We aren&rsquo;t housekeepers, doorkeepers, garbage men.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A bug in the Mission Act rollout would add to a string of high-profile IT failures for the VA. Last year, the VA&rsquo;s software system <a href=\"https://republicans-veterans.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=2255\">delayed and miscalculated stipends</a> for student veterans under the GI Bill, leading to veterans getting evicted and having their credit scores ruined. The agency&rsquo;s effort to overhaul its electronic health records has suffered from <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/va-shadow-rulers-program-is-trending-towards-red\">leadership turmoil</a> and <a href=\"https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/hearings/review-of-the-vas-electronic-health-record-modernization\">rising costs</a>.

The VA lacked a permanent IT chief until January; for most of last year, the IT division was led by a Trump campaign alumnus who closely coordinated with <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/ike-perlmutter-bruce-moskowitz-marc-sherman-shadow-rulers-of-the-va\">three men at Mar-a-Lago</a> whom the president gave sweeping influence over the VA.</p>\n<p>Wilkie has said the Mission Act will &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5186\">revolutionize</a> VA health care as we know it.&rdquo; But the USDS review said the agency is making only &ldquo;piecemeal updates&rdquo; to existing policies and procedures, and has conducted little research to understand how veterans, doctors and staff actually use private care.</p>\n<p>The report recommended starting over on a simpler tool that wouldn&rsquo;t be a drain on doctors&rsquo; time because it could be used by nurses or clerks, or even by veterans themselves. The USDS said the simpler tool could be done in time for the private care program&rsquo;s launch in June.</p>\n<p>AbleVets&rsquo; CEO, Wyatt Smith, declined to comment.</p>\n<p>If the VA doesn&rsquo;t provide a tool for veterans to check their own eligibility, patients may get into arguments with staff about whether they&rsquo;re entitled to private care, the report warned, leading &ldquo;to the public perception that the criteria are arbitrary, inconsistent, or unfair.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That concern recalls the confusion surrounding the 2014 rollout of an earlier private care program that the Mission Act is replacing. At that time, a convoluted procedure for authorizing and scheduling appointments in the private sector led many veterans to wait more than 30 days, even though getting care faster was the point of the program, according to the VA inspector general.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I remember very well in 2014 the fiasco that occurred there,&rdquo; Rep. Phil Roe, the top Republican on the House veterans committee, said at the December hearing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather keep doing exactly what we&rsquo;re doing and implement it a month later than have this thing fall on its face.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Update, April 3, 2019:</strong> At a <a href=\"https://veterans.house.gov/legislation/hearings/full-committee-oversight-hearing-mission-critical-assessing-technology-support\">congressional hearing</a> on Tuesday, several lawmakers urged the VA to consider slowing down to avoid another IT failure. Senior VA officials said they&rsquo;re confident the new software will work despite the concerns raised in the U.S. Digital Service&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5766330-USDS-Mission-Act-Report.html\">report</a>. The White House did not permit USDS to participate in the hearing, committee chairman Mark Takano said. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie told <a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/news/story/va-secretary-robert-wilkie-on-expanding-colorado-veterans-services-not-allowing-mmj\">Colorado Public Radio</a>, &ldquo;I will refute everything in that report.&rdquo; A former member of the USDS team at the VA, Emily Tavoulareas, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmilyTav/status/1113253646551048192?s=20\">responded on Twitter</a>: &quot;USDS has a mantra: Find the truth.

                "text": "As the Trump administration prepares to launch a controversial program to expand private medical care for veterans, the Department of Veterans Affairs is developing a software tool to determine who\u2019s eligible.\nBut the tool is so flawed, according to an independent review obtained by ProPublica, that it threatens to disrupt the health care of about 75,000 veterans every day.\n\u201cThis degradation goes against the spirit of the Mission Act to improve the veterans experience and quality of care,\u201d the review said, referring to the 2018 law that authorized the program to expand private care. The program is supposed to start in less than three months.\nThe review was conducted by the U.S. Digital Service, an elite group of software developers and designers employed by the White House to help federal agencies improve their technology. The USDS team said the VA should scrap the eligibility tool and start over.\nThe VA needs authorization from Congress to cover the $5.6 million cost of completing work on the eligibility tool, the department said in a March 4 letter to a House appropriations subcommittee. The panel has not yet acted on the request.\nOn Monday evening, shortly after this article was published House veterans affairs committee chairman Mark Takano called the findings by the USDS \u201cincredibly alarming\u201d and said his panel would hold a hearing to scrutinize the VA\u2019s funding request.\nVA spokesman Curt Cashour declined to comment on the USDS review, saying it \u201cremains a work in progress.\u201d The USDS didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThe USDS report raised concerns that the eligibility tool was designed in a way that wouldn\u2019t work for VA doctors. The report predicted that the tool would generate errors or run slowly or crash. These glitches would lengthen each appointment by five to 10 minutes, the USDS team estimated, which equates to being able to treat 75,000 fewer veterans every day systemwide.\nThe USDS said the contractor building the software \u2014 a Virginia-based company called AbleVets \u2014 is \u201cmotivated and capable\u201d; the problem, according to the report, is the task that the VA assigned was rushed and poorly conceived. The tool has to pull data from six separate VA systems, but those connections won\u2019t be set up in time, the USDS found. There also won\u2019t be enough time to test the tool and address any errors, according to the report.\nDoctors could balk, interviews conducted by the USDS team indicated. As the leader of primary care physicians at one VA medical center said in the report, \u201cI will instruct every one of my PCPs not to do this.\u201d\nAnother unnamed physician said of administrators who expect doctors to use the tool: \u201cThese people are out of their minds. We aren\u2019t housekeepers, doorkeepers, garbage men.\u201d\nA bug in the Mission Act rollout would add to a string of high-profile IT failures for the VA. Last year, the VA\u2019s software system delayed and miscalculated stipends for student veterans under the GI Bill, leading to veterans getting evicted and having their credit scores ruined. The agency\u2019s effort to overhaul its electronic health records has suffered from leadership turmoil and rising costs. The VA blamed its technology infrastructure for delaying the expansion of benefits for family members who take care of injured veterans.\n\u201cThe Department of Veterans Affairs, as these committees have noted on more than one occasion, has an IT problem,\u201d VA Secretary Robert Wilkie acknowledged at a congressional hearing in December. The VA lacked a permanent IT chief until January; for most of last year, the IT division was led by a Trump campaign alumnus who closely coordinated with three men at Mar-a-Lago whom the president gave sweeping influence over the VA.\nWilkie has said the Mission Act will \u201crevolutionize VA health care as we know it.\u201d But the USDS review said the agency is making only \u201cpiecemeal updates\u201d to existing policies and procedures, and has conducted little research to understand how veterans, doctors and staff actually use private care.\nThe report recommended starting over on a simpler tool that wouldn\u2019t be a drain on doctors\u2019 time because it could be used by nurses or clerks, or even by veterans themselves. The USDS said the simpler tool could be done in time for the private care program\u2019s launch in June.\nAbleVets\u2019 CEO, Wyatt Smith, declined to comment.\nIf the VA doesn\u2019t provide a tool for veterans to check their own eligibility, patients may get into arguments with staff about whether they\u2019re entitled to private care, the report warned, leading \u201cto the public perception that the criteria are arbitrary, inconsistent, or unfair.\u201d\nThat concern recalls the confusion surrounding the 2014 rollout of an earlier private care program that the Mission Act is replacing. At that time, a convoluted procedure for authorizing and scheduling appointments in the private sector led many veterans to wait more than 30 days, even though getting care faster was the point of the program, according to the VA inspector general.\n\u201cI remember very well in 2014 the fiasco that occurred there,\u201d Rep. Phil Roe, the top Republican on the House veterans committee, said at the December hearing. \u201cI\u2019d rather keep doing exactly what we\u2019re doing and implement it a month later than have this thing fall on its face.\u201d\nUpdate, April 3, 2019: At a congressional hearing on Tuesday, several lawmakers urged the VA to consider slowing down to avoid another IT failure. Senior VA officials said they\u2019re confident the new software will work despite the concerns raised in the U.S. Digital Service\u2019s report. The White House did not permit USDS to participate in the hearing, committee chairman Mark Takano said. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie told Colorado Public Radio, \u201cI will refute everything in that report.\u201d A former member of the USDS team at the VA, Emily Tavoulareas, responded on Twitter: \"USDS has a mantra: Find the truth. Tell the truth. Sounds like this admin doesn't want to hear it.\u201d\nHelp Us Investigate: Do you know what\u2019s going on at the VA?
