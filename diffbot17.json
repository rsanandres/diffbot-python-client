Prosecutors are looking to put Felicity Huffman behind bars for four to 10 months after the Desperate Housewives actress pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud on April 8, a law enforcement source told CNN.\nThe actress, along with more than 30 other rich parents, was busted in a college admissions scandal for paying to help her daughter cheat her way into college. Huffman paid $15,000 to a fake charity to help her child cheat on the SATs.\nThe law enforcement source also told CNN that the prosecutors\u2019 call to go after a sentence of up to 10 months did not have anything to do with the star\u2019s public apology.\n\u201cI am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done. I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,\u201d she said in a statement on April 8. \u201cI am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.\u201d\n\u201cMy daughter knew absolutely nothing about my actions, and in my misguided and profoundly wrong way, I have betrayed her,\u201d Huffman, 56, continued. \u201cThis transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life. My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty.\u201d\nFuller House actress Lori Loughlin and fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli were also charged with two counts of conspiracy in the college admissions scandal. However, they have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege that the couple paid half a whopping million dollars to a fake charity to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California. If found guilty, they could get up to 20 years in prison for each charge, according to CNN.\nHuffman\u2019s sentencing hearing is set for May 21.",

Tiger Woods will be receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Donald Trump announced on Monday, April 15.\n\u201cSpoke to @TigerWoods to congratulate him on the great victory he had in yesterday\u2019s @TheMasters, & to inform him that because of his incredible Success & Comeback in Sports (Golf) and, more importantly, LIFE, I will be presenting him with the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM!\u201d the president tweeted.\nThe Presidential Medal of Freedom is the highest civilian award, and is given to people who the commander in chief deems to have made \u201can especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interest of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\u201d\nThe announcement came one day after the 43-year-old golfer won his first Masters in 14 years. It was his first major win in more than a decade, and the victory put him one Masters win behind record holder Jack Nicklaus, who has six wins. The victory also put Woods within range of overtaking Nicklaus\u2019 record of 18 majors; Woods now has 15.\nHe was previously on track to set a new record, but health struggles and a series of personal issues \u2014 including his nasty headline-making 2009 split from wife Elin Nordegren, a stint in rehab for sex addiction, and DUI charge in 2017 \u2014 threatened to derail (if not end) his once great career.\nAfter his come-from-behind victory Sunday, the pro golfer thanked his family and friends and reveled in his win on Twitter.\nI can\u2019t thank my family, friends and fans enough for their support. Having my family by my side today is something I will never forget. To not only be able to play again, but to be able to win again, is something I will forever be grateful for. This jacket sure is comfortable. pic.twitter.com/LsOUX2dWH1\n\u2014 Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) April 14, 2019\nDuring the Green Jacket ceremony, Woods said that the win was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d\n\u201cLast year, I was very lucky to be playing again,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the previous Champions Dinner, I was really struggling and missed a couple of years of not playing this great tournament, and now I\u2019m the champion. \u2026 It\u2019s unreal for me to experience this. \u2026 I\u2019m just so happy and excited, and I\u2019m at a loss for words.\u201d\nOther athletes who have previously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Yogi Berra, Willie Mays, and Bill Russell.",

At the time, I didn\u2019t realize that she would not only become my wife, but would also change the face of the entertainment world,\u201d he told The Blast. \u201cI have dedicated most of our lives to the business empire that is Wendy Williams Hunter, a person that I truly love and respect unconditionally.\u201d\n\u201cI am not proud of my recent actions and take full accountability and apologize to my wife, my family, and her amazing fans,\u201d the TV producer continued. \u201cI am going through a time of self-reflection and am trying to right some wrongs.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter what the outcome is or what the future holds, we are still The Hunter Family and I will continue to work with and fully support my wife in this business and through any and all obstacles she may face living her new life of sobriety, while I also work on mine,\u201d he added. \u201cI ask that you please give me and my family privacy as we heal.\u201d\nWilliams, who shares a 19-year-old son with Hunter, filed for divorce after rumors surfaced that her husband was having an affair, and that the other woman reportedly gave birth to his love child.\n\u201cWendy\u2019s been pushed too far. She said her life has become a living hell,\u201d a source told the ENQUIRER before the entertainer filed to officially split. \u201cThe things that Kevin\u2019s done to Wendy have left her a physical wreck and her reputation in tatters.\u201d\nPrior to filing for divorce, Williams had taken a two-month break from The Wendy Williams Show, then revealed on the March 19 episode that she had been living in a sober house. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve had a struggle with cocaine in my past,\u201d she told viewers. \u201cAnd I never went to a place to get the treatment. I don\u2019t know how, except God was sitting on my shoulder and I just stopped.\u201d\nShe checked out of the sober living facility on March 25, but hours later, her team reportedly found her drunk and rushed her to the hospital, according to The Daily Mail.",

Marvin Hajos, 75, was attacked by one of the birds he was breeding after he fell on Friday, April 12, CNN reports.\nA cassowary is a large, rare bird similar to an ostrich native to Australia and New Guinea. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has the exotic bird listed as Class II wildlife, according to CNN. That means the bird, which can be as big as 6-feet tall and 160 pounds with claws as long as 5 inches, is in the same class as alligators and and clouded leopards.\nThe Alachua County Sheriff\u2019s Office told CNN that the first call to 911 was made at about 10 a.m. local time, and a second call indicated that there was an emergency with a cassowary. \u201cEMS responded to an incident where the caller gave information that an exotic bird had attacked somebody on the property,\u201d Lt. Joshua Crews told local ABC affiliate WCJB.\nLaw enforcement told CNN and WCJB that Hajos, whose death was an accident, died of his injuries at the hospital.\n\u201c[Cassowaries] have very strong legs, kick defense, claws that can literally gut you because they can jump over 4 feet in the air and that can hit anybody in the midsection,\u201d an animal conservationist with Carson Springs Wildlife Conservation Foundation told WCJB.\nThe fate of the cassowary that attacked Hajos is not yet known. According to Lt. Crews, it\u2019ll likely be up to the family. \u201cWhat they do with the bird is going to be ultimately their decision.\u201d",

Stifel made the most aggressive move by raising its target by $43 to $100 \u2014 well above the median price target of $75.85.\nOf the 25 brokerages covering the stock, 14 rate it \"buy\" or higher and the rest have a \"hold\" rating, according to Refinitiv data.\nThe company could make $2 billion annually by taking Intel's market share and regain the dominant position it enjoyed during the rollout of 4G, analysts said.",

Richard Drew / AP</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Wall Street has been watching closely as the biggest U.S. banks have reported first-quarter earnings over the last several days, trying to interpret what the results mean not just for the present, but for the future.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The issue, I believe, isn&rsquo;t where we are today, but what does the near term hold?&rdquo; said banking analyst Bert Ely.</p>\n<p>Most of the banking sector&rsquo;s results have been a mixed bag: Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase each hit profit records, with Chase beating analysts&rsquo; expectations on revenue, as well.</p>\n<p>Wells Fargo beat analysts&rsquo; expectations for per-share earnings, but the company warned that net interest income &mdash; a key profit metric &mdash; is likely to drop by up to 5 percent this year. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and M&amp;T Bank also all beat profit expectations while missing on revenue.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The guidance you&rsquo;re seeing from a lot of banks just isn&rsquo;t all that positive,&rdquo; said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.</p>\n<p>Some of that is due to the different types of financial activities and services in which specific banks specialize.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the haves and have-nots. For banks that are more focused on capital markets activity such as Goldman, it was a pretty weak quarter&hellip; despite what was clearly a very robust quarter for equities,&rdquo; said Stephen Biggar, director of financial services research at Argus Research.</p>\n<p>While ordinary Americans were happy to see their 401(k) balances recovering in the first quarter of 2019 after the market&rsquo;s wild ride in the final weeks of 2018, a more placid environment isn&rsquo;t necessarily good for bank bottom lines. &ldquo;Banks make money, generally, on volatility,&rdquo; Biggar said.</p>\n<p>Since spending and borrowing by both consumer and businesses remains robust, banks with a bigger retail or &ldquo;Main Street&rdquo; footprint fared better on the strength of commercial lending, consumer spending, and credit cards. However, analysts question how long this momentum can be sustained, especially as the stimulative effect of tax cuts fades, and whether banks will sacrifice quality for quantity.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think the big question today is what&rsquo;s coming down the road,&rdquo; Ely said. &ldquo;There are growing concerns about credit quality, in the consumer area, in business loans and in real estate, both in commercial real estate and housing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Interest rates present another challenge. Since higher rates contribute to higher net interest income, a more passive Federal Reserve could leave banks with fewer ways to generate growth.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A tailwind for banks over the past two years has been the higher short-term rates,&rdquo; Biggar said. &ldquo;But obviously, as the Fed backs off, that means banks will no longer have this as a tailwind.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With revenue growth falling short, this suggests a worrisome trend: That banks are propping up profits with aggressive cost-cutting to please investors in the short term.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The tricky part, from a cost-cutting standpoint, is you can only cut so far,&rdquo; Samana said. &ldquo;If the core of the banking business is net interest income and the yield curve is at flat as it is, it&rsquo;s a very difficult story.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And all of this is unfolding during the longest-running bull market, in a climate of near-full employment and low inflation &mdash; in other words, about as good an overall economic picture as banks could hope to see.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The sense is that there&rsquo;s more downside risk than upside potential at this point,&rdquo; Ely said. &ldquo;At the moment, things are about as good as they&rsquo;re going to get.&rdquo;</p>",

However, analysts question how long this momentum can be sustained, especially as the stimulative effect of tax cuts fades, and whether banks will sacrifice quality for quantity.\n\u201cI think the big question today is what\u2019s coming down the road,\u201d Ely said. \u201cThere are growing concerns about credit quality, in the consumer area, in business loans and in real estate, both in commercial real estate and housing.\u201d\nInterest rates present another challenge. Since higher rates contribute to higher net interest income, a more passive Federal Reserve could leave banks with fewer ways to generate growth.\n\u201cA tailwind for banks over the past two years has been the higher short-term rates,\u201d Biggar said. \u201cBut obviously, as the Fed backs off, that means banks will no longer have this as a tailwind.\u201d\nWith revenue growth falling short, this suggests a worrisome trend: That banks are propping up profits with aggressive cost-cutting to please investors in the short term.\n\u201cThe tricky part, from a cost-cutting standpoint, is you can only cut so far,\u201d Samana said. \u201cIf the core of the banking business is net interest income and the yield curve is at flat as it is, it\u2019s a very difficult story.\u201d\nAnd all of this is unfolding during the longest-running bull market, in a climate of near-full employment and low inflation \u2014 in other words, about as good an overall economic picture as banks could hope to see.\n\u201cThe sense is that there\u2019s more downside risk than upside potential at this point,\u201d Ely said. \u201cAt the moment, things are about as good as they\u2019re going to get.\u201d",

Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in a statement.\nIn both cases, WTO arbitrators have yet to set an amount, but the U.S. case against Airbus is more advanced, with a ruling possible in June or July. The EU case against Boeing could come early in 2020.\nBoth sides have said they would prefer a settlement that did not lead to the imposition of tariffs.\nThe European Union has meanwhile declared itself ready to start formal trade talks with the United States.\nThe Commission is set to start two sets of negotiations \u2014 one to cut tariffs on industrial goods, the other to make it easier for companies to show products meet E.U. or U.S. standards.\nHowever, it has insisted that agriculture not be included, putting the 28-country bloc at odds with Washington, which wants farm products to be part of the talks.",

In the case of the royal baby, it&rsquo;s likely he or she will be eligible for an American passport.</p>\n<p>The United States is one of the only countries in the world that taxes nonresident citizens. That means that even the Duchess of Sussex had to file a tax return with the IRS this year, despite being a member of the British royal family and living thousands of miles away.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The U.S. is exceptionally broad in its idea of citizenship taxation,&rdquo; said Michelle Lyon Drumbl, a clinical professor of law and director at Washington &amp; Lee University School of Law&rsquo;s Tax Clinic.</p>\n<p>An estimated 8.7 million Americans, excluding members of the military, live overseas in 160-plus countries, according to the Association of Americans Resident Overseas. Those Americans have the compliance burden of filing a tax return, but most of them will be exempt from paying extra taxes to the IRS, due to the foreign earned income tax exclusion. This allows people who earn regular-sized incomes to not have to pay additional taxes if they are not living in the U.S. They simply have to account for it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For most people it&rsquo;s not so much of a big issue, but if you&rsquo;re vastly wealthy, you&rsquo;d have a lot to worry about filing obligations,&rdquo; Dean said. While the royal baby theoretically wouldn&rsquo;t have to file a tax return next year, any investment in his or her name could potentially be within the reach of the IRS.</p>\n<p>And if the sting of being hit with a massive tax liability isn&rsquo;t enough, Americans abroad are also expected to prepare their own tax bill. Most countries tell each citizen what they owe, but in the U.S., the onus is on the taxpayer to calculate his or her own bill and send the appropriate payment to the government.</p>\n<p>Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and the United Kingdom's foreign secretary, caught the attention of the IRS in 2014 after he sold his house in London for a profit. Johnson was born in New York City in 1964 to British parents, but moved back to the U.K. as a young child.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/accidental-americans-living-abroad-fight-tax-bill-uncle-sam-n867711\">Johnson ultimately paid the tax bill,</a> which he called &ldquo;absolutely outrageous&rdquo; and renounced his U.S. citizenship. But in the land of the free, nothing comes for free. The price to renounce U.S. citizenship comes to $2,350, one of the highest in the world.</p>",

                "text": "Meghan Markle's and Prince Harry\u2019s baby will be born into privilege as a member of the British royal family, but he or she will also have the rights of an American citizen.\nAnd with that comes the duty of filing an annual tax return with the Internal Revenue Service, an obligation Americans born abroad must meet, even if they\u2019ve never lived in the United States.\n\u201cIf you are an American citizen, you owe U.S. tax no matter what,\u201d said Steve Dean, faculty director of the Graduate Tax Program at The New York University School of Law.\nUnder U.S. law, an American parent automatically passes on citizenship to a child born abroad, as long as the parent has lived in the U.S. at some point over the past five years. In the case of the royal baby, it\u2019s likely he or she will be eligible for an American passport.\nThe United States is one of the only countries in the world that taxes nonresident citizens. That means that even the Duchess of Sussex had to file a tax return with the IRS this year, despite being a member of the British royal family and living thousands of miles away.\n\u201cThe U.S. is exceptionally broad in its idea of citizenship taxation,\u201d said Michelle Lyon Drumbl, a clinical professor of law and director at Washington & Lee University School of Law\u2019s Tax Clinic.\nAn estimated 8.7 million Americans, excluding members of the military, live overseas in 160-plus countries, according to the Association of Americans Resident Overseas. Those Americans have the compliance burden of filing a tax return, but most of them will be exempt from paying extra taxes to the IRS, due to the foreign earned income tax exclusion. This allows people who earn regular-sized incomes to not have to pay additional taxes if they are not living in the U.S. They simply have to account for it.\n\u201cFor most people it\u2019s not so much of a big issue, but if you\u2019re vastly wealthy, you\u2019d have a lot to worry about filing obligations,\u201d Dean said. While the royal baby theoretically wouldn\u2019t have to file a tax return next year, any investment in his or her name could potentially be within the reach of the IRS.\nAnd if the sting of being hit with a massive tax liability isn\u2019t enough, Americans abroad are also expected to prepare their own tax bill. Most countries tell each citizen what they owe, but in the U.S., the onus is on the taxpayer to calculate his or her own bill and send the appropriate payment to the government.\nBoris Johnson, the former mayor of London and the United Kingdom's foreign secretary, caught the attention of the IRS in 2014 after he sold his house in London for a profit. Johnson was born in New York City in 1964 to British parents, but moved back to the U.K. as a young child.\nJohnson ultimately paid the tax bill, which he called \u201cabsolutely outrageous\u201d and renounced his U.S. citizenship. But in the land of the free, nothing comes for free. The price to renounce U.S. citizenship comes to $2,350, one of the highest in the world.",

But Selina Brace, an expert in <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/ancient-dna-reveals-how-bronze-age-changed-europe-n372711\">ancient DNA</a> with the Natural History Museum in London and the paper&rsquo;s lead author, said it was possible to link the monument to the research &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47938188\">as some media outlets were quick to do</a>.</p>\n<p>She said the research findings indicate that Stonehenge was built not by the earliest Neolithic farmers to arrive in Britain, but &ldquo;by their descendants, people from the same period, just later.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For their study, Brace and colleagues from the museum, Harvard University and University College London sampled DNA from 47 Neolithic period skeletons found in Britain and six skeletons of hunter-gatherers who lived in England during the preceding Mesolithic period, dating as far back as 11,600 years ago. The researchers then compared these samples to DNA taken from the skeletons of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/neolithic-europe-hunter-gatherers-farmers-coexisted-no-sex-8C11373348\">Neolithic farmers who lived at the same time in continental Europe</a>.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LfB-pUUAAAAACholya1Laf2TuFO8pyhvTcnoG0A&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb206NDQz&hl=en&v=vJuUWXolyYJx1oqUVmpPuryQ&theme=light&size=invisible&badge=bottomright&cb=foo3unyinfep\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>The analysis showed that the DNA of the Neolithic period skeletons in Britain matched the genetic &quot;signatures&quot; of early farmers in Europe, a group of people shown in previous studies to have migrated from the Aegean coast. This suggests farming practices began in Britain when these Neolithic inhabitants arrived on the island.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We knew that farming had spread from the east, but Britain is the end of the line &mdash; there&rsquo;s nowhere else to go afterwards,&rdquo; Brace said. &ldquo;There was debate about how farming arrived there: Did it arrive with the migration of people bringing the idea of farming with them and arriving in Britain, or was it transference of ideas, where hunter-gatherers saw it across Europe and started farming themselves?&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><figcaption>A facial reconstruction of Whitehawk Woman, a 5,600-year-old Neolithic woman from Sussex.Royal Pavilion and Museums, Brighton and Hove</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The study, published April 15 in the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-0871-9\">journal Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</a>, also revealed little mixing between the hunter-gatherers and the newly arrived Neolithic farmers &mdash; something that set Britain apart from parts of Europe that saw similar patterns of migration during the Neolithic period.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Unlike in continental Europe, we couldn&rsquo;t detect any mixing with indigenous <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/ancient-hunter-gatherers-also-brought-home-bacon-8C11017314\">hunter-gatherers</a> in Britain, with the exception of a few samples in Scotland,&rdquo; said study co-author Mark Thomas, a professor of evolutionary genetics at University College London.</p>\n<p>Joachim Burger, an anthropologist at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany &mdash; who was not involved with the study &mdash; called the research &ldquo;exciting&rdquo; and said cultural factors could have helped deter intermarriage between the two groups.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For me, the only logical explanation is that the culture barriers between these two groups were so strong that they didn&rsquo;t allow the population to mix,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>For all it revealed about human migration during the Neolithic period, Brace said the research offered a new way of looking at shifting populations in Britain today.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The British population has never been static,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;People can get very frightened of change and frightened of ideas of immigration. It&rsquo;s important and useful for people to see that over the last 10,000 years, Britain has not been a constant place. Change is our history. Immigration is our history.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/stonehenge-was-built-descendants-neolithic-migrants-dna-study-shows-ncna995221\">Want more stories about evolution?</a></h2>",

                "text": "We may not know exactly how or why Stonehenge was built, but new research affords a glimpse of the people who erected England\u2019s iconic stone monument some 5,000 years ago.\nThe study, which examined the origins of farming in Britain, shows that the people living in the region at the time Stonehenge was built were descended from people who had migrated to the area about 6,000 years ago from present-day Turkey.\nA paper describing the research \u2014 an analysis of DNA from the skeletal remains of farmers who lived in England from 6,000 to 4,500 years ago during the Neolithic period \u2014 doesn\u2019t focus on Stonehenge or even mention it. But Selina Brace, an expert in ancient DNA with the Natural History Museum in London and the paper\u2019s lead author, said it was possible to link the monument to the research \u2014 as some media outlets were quick to do.\nShe said the research findings indicate that Stonehenge was built not by the earliest Neolithic farmers to arrive in Britain, but \u201cby their descendants, people from the same period, just later.\u201d\nFor their study, Brace and colleagues from the museum, Harvard University and University College London sampled DNA from 47 Neolithic period skeletons found in Britain and six skeletons of hunter-gatherers who lived in England during the preceding Mesolithic period, dating as far back as 11,600 years ago. The researchers then compared these samples to DNA taken from the skeletons of Neolithic farmers who lived at the same time in continental Europe.\nThe analysis showed that the DNA of the Neolithic period skeletons in Britain matched the genetic \"signatures\" of early farmers in Europe, a group of people shown in previous studies to have migrated from the Aegean coast. This suggests farming practices began in Britain when these Neolithic inhabitants arrived on the island.\n\u201cWe knew that farming had spread from the east, but Britain is the end of the line \u2014 there\u2019s nowhere else to go afterwards,\u201d Brace said. \u201cThere was debate about how farming arrived there: Did it arrive with the migration of people bringing the idea of farming with them and arriving in Britain, or was it transference of ideas, where hunter-gatherers saw it across Europe and started farming themselves?\u201d\nThe study, published April 15 in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, also revealed little mixing between the hunter-gatherers and the newly arrived Neolithic farmers \u2014 something that set Britain apart from parts of Europe that saw similar patterns of migration during the Neolithic period.\n\u201cUnlike in continental Europe, we couldn\u2019t detect any mixing with indigenous hunter-gatherers in Britain, with the exception of a few samples in Scotland,\u201d said study co-author Mark Thomas, a professor of evolutionary genetics at University College London.\nJoachim Burger, an anthropologist at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany \u2014 who was not involved with the study \u2014 called the research \u201cexciting\u201d and said cultural factors could have helped deter intermarriage between the two groups.\n\u201cFor me, the only logical explanation is that the culture barriers between these two groups were so strong that they didn\u2019t allow the population to mix,\u201d he said.\nFor all it revealed about human migration during the Neolithic period, Brace said the research offered a new way of looking at shifting populations in Britain today.\n\u201cThe British population has never been static,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople can get very frightened of change and frightened of ideas of immigration. It\u2019s important and useful for people to see that over the last 10,000 years, Britain has not been a constant place. Change is our history. Immigration is our history.\u201d\nWant more stories about evolution?",

The complaint mentioned a book found in Kraus' camouflage backpack about an executioner, but provided no details.</p>\n<p>Police have said Kraus also told investigators he was planning to cause unspecified harm at Neenah High School, where he was a junior. No details of the nature of that plot have been revealed and it was not mentioned in the complaint released Tuesday. The school district said police determined there is no danger to students or faculty.</p>\n<p>Messages left at a number listed for Kraus' home address in Neenah were not immediately returned Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Kraus told detectives he shot his grandfather in the head first then &quot;tried to shoot his grandmother in the head,&quot; according to the complaint. Police said Letha Kraus' body was found lying on top of Dennis Kraus' body in the kitchen of the home.</p>\n<p>Officers found a shotgun with a knife taped to the end of the barrel and a knife sheath on the bed of a downstairs bedroom. A search of an upstairs bedroom uncovered a shotgun on the bed with two gun cases and ammunition, a &quot;large amount of various ammunition&quot; on the floor, and several more guns in a gun cabinet, the complaint said.</p>\n<p>Kraus told police he stayed at his grandparents' home the night before the killing.</p>\n<p>Wisconsin is one of six states that treat 17-year-olds as adults in the criminal justice system. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has included provisions in his state budget that would move 17-year-olds back into juvenile court.</p>",

                "text": "APPLETON, Wis. \u2014 A 17-year-old typed out pages on how he planned to fatally shoot his grandparents, and law enforcement found those notes with a book on an executioner in the teen's backpack after he called 911 and confessed to the killings, prosecutors in Wisconsin said Tuesday.\nAlexander M. Kraus was charged Tuesday in Outagamie County Circuit Court in Appleton, Wisconsin, with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide in the deaths of 74-year-old Dennis Kraus and 73-year-old Letha Kraus. Each charge carries a life sentence.\nOutagamie County Court Commissioner Brian Figy ordered Kraus held on a $2 million cash bond. Greg Petit, Kraus' attorney, declined to comment Tuesday, telling The Associated Press after the hearing he \"doesn't know enough\" yet about the case.\nPolice found the bodies Sunday at their home in Grand Chute, a small city about 110 miles northwest of Milwaukee, after a male called the police and said he needed to be arrested in the deaths, according to a criminal complaint.\nAn autopsy found that Dennis Kraus was shot once in the head and Letha Kraus suffered two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the right forearm.\nThere were \"several pages\" in a red folder outlining how Kraus would kill his grandparents, investigators said in the complaint, which provided no motive for the shootings. The complaint mentioned a book found in Kraus' camouflage backpack about an executioner, but provided no details.\nPolice have said Kraus also told investigators he was planning to cause unspecified harm at Neenah High School, where he was a junior. No details of the nature of that plot have been revealed and it was not mentioned in the complaint released Tuesday. The school district said police determined there is no danger to students or faculty.\nMessages left at a number listed for Kraus' home address in Neenah were not immediately returned Tuesday.\nKraus told detectives he shot his grandfather in the head first then \"tried to shoot his grandmother in the head,\" according to the complaint. Police said Letha Kraus' body was found lying on top of Dennis Kraus' body in the kitchen of the home.\nOfficers found a shotgun with a knife taped to the end of the barrel and a knife sheath on the bed of a downstairs bedroom. A search of an upstairs bedroom uncovered a shotgun on the bed with two gun cases and ammunition, a \"large amount of various ammunition\" on the floor, and several more guns in a gun cabinet, the complaint said.\nKraus told police he stayed at his grandparents' home the night before the killing.\nWisconsin is one of six states that treat 17-year-olds as adults in the criminal justice system. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has included provisions in his state budget that would move 17-year-olds back into juvenile court.",

Lockout limits entry to and exit from the restricted schools, but leaves usual procedures otherwise in place.\nThe woman, identified as Sol Pais, 18, flew from the Miami area to Colorado, and investigators believe she bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition after arriving, Dean Phillips, FBI special agent in charge of the Denver field office, said Tuesday night at a news conference.\nPais, a high school student in Miami Beach, then went to an area of the foothills where she was last seen, \"and we have been trying to find her ever since,\" Phillips said.\n\"Because of her comments and her actions, because of her travel here to the state, because of her procurement of a weapon immediately upon arriving here, we considered her to be a credible threat \u2014 certainly to the community and potentially to schools,\" Phillips said.\n\"She has had an infatuation with Columbine and the perpetrators of Columbine,\" he said. \"She has made comments to that effect, but she hasn't identified a specific threat to a specific school.\"\nPhillips said that \"her comments, her actions that we have heard about from others, tend to cause us great concern that she may pose a threat to a school \u2014 not necessarily Columbine.\"\nHe added, \"Our priority in this situation is to try and find Ms. Pais.\"\nThe shootings at Columbine, in Littleton, which left 12 students and a teacher dead, occurred 20 years ago this week.\nPais, who is described as white and about 5-foot-5 with brown hair, was last seen wearing a black T-shirt, camouflage pants and black boots, said Mike Taplin, a Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman. He said that the sheriff's office was notified about the FBI investigation late Tuesday morning and that about 22 schools in Jefferson County, including Columbine, were placed on lockout shortly after noon.\nApril 16, 201902:35\nJefferson County school and sheriff's officials said that all students were safe and that most after-school activities were continuing as scheduled except at Columbine, where they were canceled.\nNo further details on the exception at Columbine were immediately available.\nJefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader said Tuesday night that \"we take these threats seriously.\"\n\"It's certainly not the first threat that we\u2019ve had that involves Columbine High School, or references it,\" Shrader said. \"And in that regard, I know that this opens a wound, especially on an anniversary week, for those families who were most deeply impacted by this.\"",

                "text": "OPELOUSAS, La. \u2014 The white man suspected in the burnings of three African American churches in Louisiana is now facing hate crime charges in the arson cases.\nHolden Matthews, the 21-year-old son of a sheriff's deputy, entered his not guilty plea via video conference from the St. Landry Parish jail on Monday. The judge set a September trial date.\nMatthews, who had no previous criminal record, was arrested Wednesday on three charges of arson of a religious building. Prosecutors filed documents Monday adding three more charges, accusing Matthews of violating Louisiana's hate crime law, confirming that they believe the fires were racially motivated, a link authorities had previously stopped short of making.\nBrowning said federal officials also are considering filing additional federal hate crime and arson charges against Matthews.\nIn denying bail, state District Judge James Doherty sided with law enforcement officials who said they worried Matthews would try to flee the area or set more fires.\n\"We felt that he was an immediate risk to public safety,\" said Louisiana Fire Marshal Butch Browning. \"In my mind, I felt another fire was imminent.\"\nTestifying in court, Browning outlined a litany of evidence, including new details of the investigation, that he said tied Matthews to the torching of the three black churches over 10 days.\nThe fire marshal described cellphone records placing Matthews at the fire locations, and he said images on the phone showed all three churches burning before law enforcement arrived and showed Matthews \"claiming responsibility\" for the fires.\nMatthews, shackled and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, never spoke to the court during the hearing, letting his court-appointed lawyer enter the not guilty plea for him. His parents watched their son's appearance on video conference from the courtroom, his dad repeatedly wringing his hands and, at one point, leaving the room in tears.\nThe fires, all started with gasoline, occurred in and around Opelousas, about 60 miles west of Louisiana's capital city of Baton Rouge.\nA crowdfunding campaign for the three gutted churches was climbing Tuesday after social media posts urging the public not to forget the plight of the small houses of worship as the eyes of the world were on the fire-ravaged Notre Dame cathedral in Paris.\nAs we hold Paris in our thoughts today, let\u2019s also send some love to our neighbors in Louisiana.

He was then escorted into a room where authorities said the sexual activity took place.</p>\n<p>The woman then &quot;helped him get dressed and hugged him again&quot; before Kraft allegedly handed her at least $100 and left, the affidavit states.</p>\n<p>The Orchids of Asia Day Spa where Kraft allegedly paid for services was one of multiple spas involved in the police investigation.

                "text": "Florida prosecutors have offered New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and around two dozen other men a pretrial deal that would drop charges against them of soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor.\nKraft, 77, was one of at least 25 people charged in February as part of a monthslong human trafficking investigation that police at the time said spanned from China to Florida.\nThe NFL owner pleaded not guilty in late February to two counts of solicitation at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida.\nKraft is not alleged to be involved in human trafficking, and a spokesman for him said in a statement last month that they \"categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity.\"\nThe offer from prosecutors was first reported Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal.\nNBC News obtained a copy of a letter from the prosecutors in Palm Beach County offering a deal to resolve the charges, which sources close to the investigation tell NBC News was given to each of the defendants charged with solicitation in the Orchids of Asia massage parlor investigation.\nThe pretrial deal is part of a deferred prosecution program sometimes offered to first-time offenders who concede the state would have been able to prove their guilt.\nKraft and the others charged with solicitation in the Orchids of Asia probe would have their charges dropped in exchange for their conceding that they would have been found guilty, completing 100 hours of community service per charge, taking an education course on prostitution, undergoing a screening for sexually transmitted diseases, and paying $5,000 per charge.\nEach defendant would also have to provide a statement detailing what happened in the Orchids of Asia massage parlor room.\nA lawyer for Kraft did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News about the prosecution\u2019s offer.\nState Attorney for Palm Beach County Dave Aronberg said on Twitter Tuesday that such deals with first-time offenders are \"standard in cases like this.\"\nAll defendants charged with solicitation in the Orchids of Asia investigation were charged with one count of soliciting, except Kraft who was charged with two counts.\nThe billionaire CEO and chairman of The Kraft Group allegedly visited the spa twice in January, once on the 19th and again on the morning of the 20th \u2014 hours before the Patriots won the AFC Championship sending them to the Super Bowl, according to court documents.\nInvestigators say he was seen on surveillance video with a spa worker on both days.\nOn his Jan. 20 visit, investigators say Kraft was seen on surveillance video paying cash \"at the front desk to an Asian female,\" one of the affidavits release last month said. He was then escorted into a room where authorities said the sexual activity took place.\nThe woman then \"helped him get dressed and hugged him again\" before Kraft allegedly handed her at least $100 and left, the affidavit states.\nThe Orchids of Asia Day Spa where Kraft allegedly paid for services was one of multiple spas involved in the police investigation. According to a Palm Beach County affidavit, online reviews of the spa used various slang terms that identified that the business provided sexual services.\nThe NFL said in a statement last month that owners as well as players are subject to the league's personal conduct policy.\n\"We will handle this allegation in the same way we would handle any issue under the policy. We are seeking a full understanding of the facts, while ensuring that we do not interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation,\" the statement read. \"We will take appropriate action as warranted based on the facts.\"",

The Financial Services Committee is exploring these matters, including as they may involve the President and his associates, as thoroughly as possible pursuant to its oversight authority, and will follow the facts wherever they may lead us.\"\nTrump has been associated with Deutsche Bank since the late 1990s, a time when the big Wall Street banks wouldn't lend to him following a series of business mishaps.\nEric Trump, the president's son and an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, slammed the subpoenas as an \"abuse of power\" in a statement to NBC News.\n\u201cThis subpoena is an unprecedented abuse of power and simply the latest attempt by House Democrats to attack the President and our family for political gain,\" he said. \"Instead of legislating, the committee is obsessed with harassing and undermining my father\u2019s administration, doing everything they can to distract from his incredible accomplishments. This incompetence is the exact reason why the American people have such disdain for politicians and why my father was elected President. Today\u2019s actions by the committee set a horrible precedent for all taxpayers.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank spokeswoman Kerrie McHugh told NBC News that the bank \u201cis engaged in a productive dialogue\" with the two committees.\n\"We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations in a manner consistent with our legal obligations,\" McHugh said.\nSchiff told The New Yorker in a profile published in December that he is interested in the German financial institution because of its longtime relationship with Trump and its past ties to Russian money laundering.\nIn 2017, Deutsche Bank was fined nearly $630 million by New York and British financial regulators for its role in a Russian money-laundering scheme.\nTrump's financial disclosures showed he held roughly $360 million in debt to the bank before his election as president, The Washington Post reported in 2016.\nSchiff told NBC News' \u201cMeet The Press\u201d in December that Trump's records with Deutsche Bank could expose \"a form of compromise\" with Russia.\n\"Well, the concern about Deutsche Bank is that they have a history of laundering Russian money,\" Schiff said. \u201cAnd this, apparently, was the one bank that was willing to do business with the Trump Organization.\"\nSchiff added, \"If this is a form of compromise, it needs to be exposed.\u201d\nTrump said in 2017 that any efforts by special counsel Robert Mueller to look into his business dealings would be crossing \"a red line.\" He also reportedly exploded in anger after erroneous news reports that Mueller had subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank, which led Trump to consider firing Mueller in early December 2017, The New York Times reported, citing White House officials, people close to the president and others familiar with the episode.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James' office also issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank in March as part of an inquiry into a set of major Trump Organization projects, a source familiar with the investigation told NBC News.",

Alex Brandon / AP file</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A notorious California con man has been charged with defrauding donors out of more than $250,000 sent to sham political groups and websites for Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders and other prominent Democrats, prosecutors said Tuesday.</p>\n<p>John Pierre Dupont, 80, is accused of setting up at least three bogus political action committees, or PACs, and several websites that purported to be raising money for roughly 10 individual Senate candidates, a candidate for governor and for progressive causes, according to a criminal complaint.</p>\n<p>Instead of passing along the cash to the candidates or campaigns, Dupont used it to pay his rent, a parking ticket, and to cover the costs of a $25,300 Mercedes-Benz sedan, according to prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p>&quot;As alleged, John Pierre Dupont operated multiple fake political action committees and falsely claimed to be raising money to support more than a dozen campaigns,&quot; said U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman.</p>\n<p>&quot;Thousands of donors believed their hard-earned money was being used to support the causes described in solicitations, but in reality, the scam PACs had no operations beyond the fundraising itself, and no funds were used to support candidates.&quot;</p>\n<p>Attempts to reach Dupont &mdash; a once wealthy financier who was twice convicted of white collar crimes in the 1980s and 1990s, and who once escaped from prison &mdash; were not successful.</p>\n<figure><figcaption>A fraudulent website was set up to look like it was in support of Democrat Beto O'Rourke's Senate campaign.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The websites Dupont created included Beto4Senate.org, Sanders2016Campaign.org, GillumForFloridaGovernor.org and ImmigrantChildrenUnited.org, according to the complaint.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LfB-pUUAAAAACholya1Laf2TuFO8pyhvTcnoG0A&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb206NDQz&hl=en&v=vJuUWXolyYJx1oqUVmpPuryQ&theme=light&size=invisible&badge=bottomright&cb=mbbn0obzj1v0\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Dupont posted messages on the sites designed to pull at the heartstrings of progressive donors.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our volunteer attorneys, doctors, nurses and social workers are working day and night to liberate these children,&quot; read the immigrant children united website. &quot;Donations will go to help pay our volunteer attorneys', doctors', nurses' and social workers' costs and pay for transportation to unite immigrant families.&quot;</p>\n<p>The Sanders site read: &quot;EVERY TIME WE PROCESS YOUR CREDIT CARD DONATION, THE BIG BANKS TAKE UP TO 40% OF THE DONATIONS JUST FOR PROCESSING YOUR CREDIT CARD DONATION...THAT IS WHY WE ARE GIVING YOU THE OPTION...TO MAKE YOUR DONATIONS IN CASH OR CHECK.&quot;</p>\n<p>The court papers say that nearly all of the more than 1,000 donations to the scam PACs and websites were in fact pocketed by Dupont.</p>\n<p>Dupont, who was charged with wire fraud and identity theft, failed to report the donations to the Federal Election Commission as required by law, or direct them to the campaigns or causes that the websites and organizations purported to champion, according to the complaint.</p>\n<p>Dupont faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted on both charges, prosecutors said. There's no indication that the campaigns or candidates had any knowledge of the scheme, prosecutors said.</p>\n<p>The new charges mark a new low in the rollercoaster life of Dupont, a California native who went from multimillionaire financier to money-losing felon in the 1980s.</p>\n<p>Then known as John Gary Rinaldo, Dupont pleaded guilty to mail fraud in 1985 in a scheme that fueled investment losses in the tens of millions of dollars, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p>\n<p>After serving a three-year prison sentence, Dupont was convicted again in 1991 after he attempted to obtain a $360,000 mortgage on a home that he did not own, according to the Times. He was sentenced to 46 months behind bars on charges of bank fraud and money laundering.</p>\n<p>In June 1992, Dupont escaped from a minimum-security federal prison in northern Oregon, according to the Times. Dupont had been transferred to the facility after it was reported that he had testified for the prosecution in a Mafia-related, double-murder trial in Indiana the previous year, the Times reported.</p>\n<p>Dupont remained on the lam for five years. He was captured in 1997 and hit with additional charges, court records show.</p>\n<p>Dupont was released from federal custody in 1999, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons.</p>\n<p>Several years earlier, in 1985, Dupont had expressed dismay over the trajectory of his life while appealing for a shorter jail sentence.</p>\n<p>&quot;Instead of being brilliant, I'm a felon,&quot; he told a judge, according to the Times. &quot;I should have never gone into the business. I didn't have the heart or personality to be a lender.&quot;</p>",

There's no indication that the campaigns or candidates had any knowledge of the scheme, prosecutors said.\nThe new charges mark a new low in the rollercoaster life of Dupont, a California native who went from multimillionaire financier to money-losing felon in the 1980s.\nThen known as John Gary Rinaldo, Dupont pleaded guilty to mail fraud in 1985 in a scheme that fueled investment losses in the tens of millions of dollars, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nAfter serving a three-year prison sentence, Dupont was convicted again in 1991 after he attempted to obtain a $360,000 mortgage on a home that he did not own, according to the Times. He was sentenced to 46 months behind bars on charges of bank fraud and money laundering.\nIn June 1992, Dupont escaped from a minimum-security federal prison in northern Oregon, according to the Times. Dupont had been transferred to the facility after it was reported that he had testified for the prosecution in a Mafia-related, double-murder trial in Indiana the previous year, the Times reported.\nDupont remained on the lam for five years. He was captured in 1997 and hit with additional charges, court records show.\nDupont was released from federal custody in 1999, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons.\nSeveral years earlier, in 1985, Dupont had expressed dismay over the trajectory of his life while appealing for a shorter jail sentence.\n\"Instead of being brilliant, I'm a felon,\" he told a judge, according to the Times. \"I should have never gone into the business. I didn't have the heart or personality to be a lender.\"",

The group is a non-profit that combats wasteful government spending on animal testing.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's crazy,&quot; Jim Keen, a former USDA scientist, told NBC News, which obtained a copy of the report. &quot;Cannibal cats, cats eating dogs &mdash; I don't see the logic.&quot;</p>\n<p>The experiments &mdash; some of which the agency said in scientific reports were aimed at studying different forms of a parasite that causes the food-borne illness toxoplasmosis &mdash; are believed to have been conducted between 2003 and 2015. The animals that were euthanized to be used as lab food included over 400 dogs from Colombia, Brazil and Vietnam and over 100 cats from China and Ethiopia.</p>\n<p>&quot;Some of these cats and dogs were purchased by the government from the same Asian meat markets that the U.S. Congress roundly condemned in a House Resolution&quot; last year, said the report by the WCW.</p>\n<p>The group plans on releasing its findings, which were culled from the USDA's own research publications, in a report to Congress entitled, &quot;USDA Kitten Cannibalism.&quot;</p>\n<figure><figcaption>A feline purchased by the USDA facility in Maryland stands on a table in this undated photo obtained by a FOIA request. Felines, like the one shown, are used to breed kittens for taxoplasmosis experiments.WCW</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The experiments were carried out at the USDA's Agricultural Research Service's Animal Parasitic Disease Laboratory in Beltsville, Md. The facility was already under fire from some lawmakers for killing cats intentionally infected with T. Gondii, the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis.</p>\n<p>&quot;The details of these kitten experiments keep getting worse and they need to end now,&quot; said Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., the lead Republican co-sponsor of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/paws-these-cats-bill-seeks-stop-gov-t-slaughter-kittens-n980321\">legislation aimed at stopping</a> the cat killings.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LfB-pUUAAAAACholya1Laf2TuFO8pyhvTcnoG0A&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb206NDQz&hl=en&v=vJuUWXolyYJx1oqUVmpPuryQ&theme=light&size=invisible&badge=bottomright&cb=tiaugjwxjguy\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>&quot;The fact that the USDA has been rounding up pets and other innocent dogs and cats in foreign countries &mdash;including at Chinese meat markets condemned by Congress &mdash; killing them and feeding them to lab cats back here in the States is simply disgusting and unjustifiable.&quot;</p>\n<p>Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., called the revelations &quot;deeply disturbing.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;We can advance scientific discovery while treating animals humanely, and American taxpayers have every right to expect our government will meet that standard,&quot; he said in a statement, while urging passage of the legislation, entitled Kittens in Traumatic Testing Ends Now &mdash; or KITTEN.</p>\n<p>The agency has been breeding kittens at the lab since 1982, and feeding them raw meat to infect them with T. Gondii. Scientists harvest the parasites from their stool for two to three weeks, and then euthanize and incinerate the cats. Cats are used because they're the only host animal that produces parasite eggs.</p>\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says toxoplasmosis is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/index.html\">one of the leading causes of death</a> from foodborne illnesses in the U.S. While over 40 million Americans are believed to carry the parasite without an issue, exposure can have &quot;severe consequences&quot; for people who are pregnant or have a compromised immune system.</p>\n<p>Keen, who left the USDA after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/dining/animal-welfare-at-risk-in-experiments-for-meat-industry.html\">blowing the whistle on mistreatment</a> of livestock in Nebraska in 2015, said the Maryland experiments have helped combat toxoplasmosis, but that scientists there haven't had any major breakthroughs in about 20 years. He and WCW vice president of advocacy and public policy Justin Goodman contend that scientists can continue their work with the samples they already have, and don't need to keep infecting and killing kittens.</p>\n<p>&quot;They just don't need to do it anymore; it's scientifically unnecessary,&quot; Goodman said.</p>\n<p>Keen was also at a loss to explain the scientific purpose of the &quot;cannibal&quot; experiments. The USDA is supposed to protect the food supply, but cats and dogs aren't part of the food chain in the United States.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's totally unrelated to the food safety mission,&quot; Keen said. &quot;We shouldn't be paying for that as taxpayers.&quot;</p>\n<p>Keen, who's now a private citizen, learned about the experiments while researching the Maryland lab's scientific publications. The publications said the dogs and cats were killed in Asia, South America and Africa, and then tissues from the animals were sent to Maryland.</p>\n<p>Some of the publications detailed feeding tissue from cat hearts, brains and tongues to other cats. Others involved feeding the same parts of dogs to the lab cats, and in some cases, injecting the tissue from the infected cats into mice.</p>\n<p>The studies conducted using animals from China said &quot;the cats were killed humanely according to PRC laws for slaughtering of food animal (sic).&quot; The WCW report calls that claim &quot;concerning and deceptive,&quot; and pointed to the 2018 <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-resolution/401/text?format=txt\">Congressional resolution </a> condemning the Chinese facilities. The resolution said the treatment of dogs and cats in the Chinese facilities &quot;would breach anti-cruelty laws in the United States.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;These were all abnormal diets for cats, dogs and mice so likely irrelevant to natural toxoplasmosis biology. Their scientific relevance and justification is questionable, at best, as is their relevance to American public health since we do not consume cats and dogs, and the practice is now outlawed in U.S.,&quot; the report says.</p>\n<p>The USDA, which did not respond to requests for comment, has defended the cat testing in the past, calling it &quot;life-saving research.&quot;</p>\n<p>The WCW says almost 4,000 cats have been killed since the testing began, and that the experiments have cost taxpayers about $22 million to date.</p>",

                "text": "U.S. government scientists bought hundreds of dogs and cats from \"Asian meat markets\" and conducted experiments that included feeding their remains to healthy lab cats for needless research, according to a disturbing watchdog report being released Tuesday.\nOther experiments at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's lab in Maryland included feeding dog remains to cats and injecting cat remains into mice, the report by the White Coat Waste Project found. The group is a non-profit that combats wasteful government spending on animal testing.\n\"It's crazy,\" Jim Keen, a former USDA scientist, told NBC News, which obtained a copy of the report. \"Cannibal cats, cats eating dogs \u2014 I don't see the logic.\"\nThe experiments \u2014 some of which the agency said in scientific reports were aimed at studying different forms of a parasite that causes the food-borne illness toxoplasmosis \u2014 are believed to have been conducted between 2003 and 2015. The animals that were euthanized to be used as lab food included over 400 dogs from Colombia, Brazil and Vietnam and over 100 cats from China and Ethiopia.\n\"Some of these cats and dogs were purchased by the government from the same Asian meat markets that the U.S. Congress roundly condemned in a House Resolution\" last year, said the report by the WCW.\nThe group plans on releasing its findings, which were culled from the USDA's own research publications, in a report to Congress entitled, \"USDA Kitten Cannibalism.\"\nThe experiments were carried out at the USDA's Agricultural Research Service's Animal Parasitic Disease Laboratory in Beltsville, Md. The facility was already under fire from some lawmakers for killing cats intentionally infected with T. Gondii, the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis.\n\"The details of these kitten experiments keep getting worse and they need to end now,\" said Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., the lead Republican co-sponsor of legislation aimed at stopping the cat killings.\n\"The fact that the USDA has been rounding up pets and other innocent dogs and cats in foreign countries \u2014including at Chinese meat markets condemned by Congress \u2014 killing them and feeding them to lab cats back here in the States is simply disgusting and unjustifiable.\"\nSen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., called the revelations \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\"We can advance scientific discovery while treating animals humanely, and American taxpayers have every right to expect our government will meet that standard,\" he said in a statement, while urging passage of the legislation, entitled Kittens in Traumatic Testing Ends Now \u2014 or KITTEN.\nThe agency has been breeding kittens at the lab since 1982, and feeding them raw meat to infect them with T. Gondii. Scientists harvest the parasites from their stool for two to three weeks, and then euthanize and incinerate the cats. Cats are used because they're the only host animal that produces parasite eggs.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says toxoplasmosis is one of the leading causes of death from foodborne illnesses in the U.S. While over 40 million Americans are believed to carry the parasite without an issue, exposure can have \"severe consequences\" for people who are pregnant or have a compromised immune system.\nKeen, who left the USDA after blowing the whistle on mistreatment of livestock in Nebraska in 2015, said the Maryland experiments have helped combat toxoplasmosis, but that scientists there haven't had any major breakthroughs in about 20 years. He and WCW vice president of advocacy and public policy Justin Goodman contend that scientists can continue their work with the samples they already have, and don't need to keep infecting and killing kittens.\n\"They just don't need to do it anymore; it's scientifically unnecessary,\" Goodman said.\nKeen was also at a loss to explain the scientific purpose of the \"cannibal\" experiments. The USDA is supposed to protect the food supply, but cats and dogs aren't part of the food chain in the United States.\n\"It's totally unrelated to the food safety mission,\" Keen said. \"We shouldn't be paying for that as taxpayers.\"\nKeen, who's now a private citizen, learned about the experiments while researching the Maryland lab's scientific publications. The publications said the dogs and cats were killed in Asia, South America and Africa, and then tissues from the animals were sent to Maryland.\nSome of the publications detailed feeding tissue from cat hearts, brains and tongues to other cats. Others involved feeding the same parts of dogs to the lab cats, and in some cases, injecting the tissue from the infected cats into mice.\nThe studies conducted using animals from China said \"the cats were killed humanely according to PRC laws for slaughtering of food animal (sic).\" The WCW report calls that claim \"concerning and deceptive,\" and pointed to the 2018 Congressional resolution condemning the Chinese facilities. The resolution said the treatment of dogs and cats in the Chinese facilities \"would breach anti-cruelty laws in the United States.\"\n\"These were all abnormal diets for cats, dogs and mice so likely irrelevant to natural toxoplasmosis biology. Their scientific relevance and justification is questionable, at best, as is their relevance to American public health since we do not consume cats and dogs, and the practice is now outlawed in U.S.,\" the report says.\nThe USDA, which did not respond to requests for comment, has defended the cat testing in the past, calling it \"life-saving research.\"\nThe WCW says almost 4,000 cats have been killed since the testing began, and that the experiments have cost taxpayers about $22 million to date.",

The more that's known about the president's business conduct and his conduct in office, the more I think people are going to come to question whether they really think it's such a great idea being behind this commander in chief in office,&quot; he said.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LfB-pUUAAAAACholya1Laf2TuFO8pyhvTcnoG0A&co=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb206NDQz&hl=en&v=vJuUWXolyYJx1oqUVmpPuryQ&theme=light&size=invisible&badge=bottomright&cb=7xh7uejlsvjd\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Weld said he believes much of Trump's support is steered by &quot;party bosses&quot; in state GOP committees, but he wants to talk directly to Republican voters about Trump's conduct and his policies.</p>\n<p>&quot;We want the election, both the primary and general, decided by voters and not party bosses,&quot; he said. &quot;I think what (voters) are saying is they are buffaloed and they want to stick with the Republican Party because they like the way it feels. I don't think they've examined the president's conduct.&quot;</p>\n<p>Weld said he and Trump differ on &quot;many, many&quot; issues; Weld said he is an &quot;economic conservative&quot; who has a track record of cutting spending and taxes in Massachusetts. He said the president has demeaned America's allies and his economic policies have not been good for the country.</p>\n<p>&quot;I aim to call the president out on issues like spending and insulting our allies,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>But, Weld said he has one thing in common with the president.</p>\n<p>&quot;We're both big, orange men,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>Primary challenges sometimes precede losses for presidents whose approval ratings have dipped in the run-up to elections. Conservative pundit Pat Buchanan challenged President George H.W. Bush to the Republican nomination in 1992. Bush ultimately lost that general election to Bill Clinton. Ronald Reagan challenged President Gerald Ford in 1976. Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in the general election.</p>\n<p>Trump remains deeply popular with Republican voters, however. <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx\">A recent Gallup poll </a>shows that the president has an 89 percent job approval rating among Republican voters, and a 45 percent approval rating overall. Trump&rsquo;s re-election campaign also raised more than $30 million in the first quarter of 2019, far outpacing the field of Democratic candidates heading into the 2020 race.</p>",

The more that's known about the president's business conduct and his conduct in office, the more I think people are going to come to question whether they really think it's such a great idea being behind this commander in chief in office,\" he said.\nWeld said he believes much of Trump's support is steered by \"party bosses\" in state GOP committees, but he wants to talk directly to Republican voters about Trump's conduct and his policies.\n\"We want the election, both the primary and general, decided by voters and not party bosses,\" he said. \"I think what (voters) are saying is they are buffaloed and they want to stick with the Republican Party because they like the way it feels. I don't think they've examined the president's conduct.\"\nWeld said he and Trump differ on \"many, many\" issues; Weld said he is an \"economic conservative\" who has a track record of cutting spending and taxes in Massachusetts. He said the president has demeaned America's allies and his economic policies have not been good for the country.\n\"I aim to call the president out on issues like spending and insulting our allies,\" he said.\nBut, Weld said he has one thing in common with the president.\n\"We're both big, orange men,\" he said.\nPrimary challenges sometimes precede losses for presidents whose approval ratings have dipped in the run-up to elections. Conservative pundit Pat Buchanan challenged President George H.W. Bush to the Republican nomination in 1992. Bush ultimately lost that general election to Bill Clinton. Ronald Reagan challenged President Gerald Ford in 1976. Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in the general election.\nTrump remains deeply popular with Republican voters, however. A recent Gallup poll shows that the president has an 89 percent job approval rating among Republican voters, and a 45 percent approval rating overall. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign also raised more than $30 million in the first quarter of 2019, far outpacing the field of Democratic candidates heading into the 2020 race.",

While sitting at a Starbucks store recently talking to a reporter, he kept looking over his shoulder mid-conversation, scanning people and cars passing by.</p>\n<p>For years, Kramer, 35, founder of the now-defunct startup app developer Six4Three, has been involved in a high-stakes legal battle with Facebook. He suspects the technology company has hired people to surveil him, because he says he has seen people taking photos outside his San Francisco apartment.</p>\n<p>Facebook says the surveillance claim is &ldquo;absolute fantasy&rdquo; and denied monitoring Kramer.</p>\n<p>Kramer&rsquo;s concern is far from the most bizarre thing about his lawsuit, which has prompted an investigation by the British Parliament and shows no sign of resolution.</p>\n<p>The David vs. Goliath contest pits Kramer&rsquo;s small startup, which in 2013 built a short-lived app to identify Facebook photos of users&rsquo; friends in bikinis, against one of the most powerful technology companies in the world. Six4Three sued Facebook in 2015 in state court in San Mateo County after Facebook restricted its access to the user data that its app, called Pikinis, and thousands of other apps, relied on to function.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.today.com/video/mark-zuckerberg-leveraged-facebook-user-data-leaked-documents-show-1495022659548\"><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1240px)\" srcset=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201904/tdy_news_gosk_facebook_190416_1920x1080.focal-860x484.jpg\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 758px)\" srcset=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201904/tdy_news_gosk_facebook_190416_1920x1080.focal-1000x563.jpg\"></source><img src=\"https://media11.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201904/tdy_news_gosk_facebook_190416_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg\"></img></picture></a></figure>\n<p>The case started small, and initially attracted little notice beyond tech blogs, but it has grown into a massive headache for Facebook. Over the course of the case, the social media giant was forced to turn over thousands of pages of internal documents, which show Facebook&rsquo;s years-long efforts to control its competitors by sharing or withholding Facebook user data. The documents &mdash; some of which were published by the British Parliament last year and more of which were recently obtained by Duncan Campbell, a British journalist who <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-leveraged-facebook-user-data-fight-rivals-help-friends-n994706\">shared them with NBC News </a>and other media outlets &mdash; show how Facebook publicly described its decisions as driven by user privacy concerns, while the company was actually focused on threats from competitors.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like we are fishing in this tiny boat with no one else around and we somehow managed to hook a massive great white shark on our line,&rdquo; Kramer said in his first extensive public comments on the case, a lengthy emailed response to questions that were screened by his attorney. The emails were exchanged between meetings in San Francisco and Redwood City.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve kept it on the line for four years and have been slowly but surely reeling it in,&rdquo; Kramer continued in one of the emails. &ldquo;The more we reel it in, the more tricks it finds to try to yank itself off the line. But it&rsquo;s still on that line. It has almost tipped our boat over a few times and it may end up tipping the boat over very soon. But we will hold onto that rod even while drowning. We&rsquo;ll keep pulling that line in. We might go down, but the shark&rsquo;s coming with us.&quot;</p>\n<p>Facebook reiterated its view that Six4Three&rsquo;s lawsuit is &ldquo;meritless&rdquo; and in an emailed statement questioned the startup&rsquo;s claims about what the internal documents show.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As we've said many times, Six4Three &mdash; creators of the Pikinis app &mdash; cherry-picked these documents from years ago as part of a lawsuit to force Facebook to share information on friends of the app's users,&rdquo; Paul Grewal, Facebook&rsquo;s deputy general counsel, told NBC News in a statement. &ldquo;The set of documents, by design, tells only one side of the story and omits important context. We still stand by the platform changes we made in 2014/2015 to prevent people from sharing their friends' information with developers like the creators of Pikinis.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>NBC News has not been able to determine whether the documents represent a complete picture. Facebook declined to provide additional evidence to support its view that they were cherry-picked.</p>\n<p>Facebook has publicly painted Six4Three as an <a href=\"https://m.cnn.com/en/article/h_43073e4a71c3098ae611b53f816d1987\">unsuccessful company</a> that sought to exploit the same privacy vulnerabilities in Facebook&rsquo;s platform as the data-harvesting boogeyman Cambridge Analytica.</p>\n<p>But some experts believe the significance of Kramer&rsquo;s lawsuit goes far beyond an app that might be viewed as unsavory.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ted is at the center of one of the most important questions of our decade: How can personal information and privacy be used to harm competition?&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://ashkansoltani.org/\">Ashkan Soltani</a>, who previously served as the Federal Trade Commission&rsquo;s chief technologist and is now an independent privacy researcher based in Oakland, California.</p>\n<p>Still, Kramer&rsquo;s crusade has found few public allies in the tech industry.</p>\n<p>At least half a dozen prominent investors and startup founders told NBC News in private conversations that they&rsquo;re rooting for Six4Three, but that they would not say anything publicly that could harm their relationship with the social network.</p>\n<p>As a result of the lawsuit, Kramer fears becoming an outcast in Silicon Valley. But his goal has not changed: to put Facebook&rsquo;s entire business model on trial &mdash; particularly what he views as the company&rsquo;s bait-and-switch of offering Facebook user data to apps like Pikinis and then removing it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is all because I am standing up for what is right and trying to hold Facebook accountable for its fraud,&rdquo; Kramer said in an email, &ldquo;something state and federal governments should have done a long time ago.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/inside-bikini-photo-startup-six4three-s-scrappy-battle-put-facebook-n995016\">SIX4THREE&rsquo;S CASE AGAINST FACEBOOK</a></h3>\n<p>Six4Three&rsquo;s legal case is relatively simple: The startup alleges Facebook never gave it a fair chance to compete.</p>\n<p>Six4Three argued in its 2015 <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5775208-CIV533328-13.html\">complaint</a> that it created a business model in 2013 based on <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2007/05/facebook-unveils-platform-for-developers-of-social-applications/\">Facebook&rsquo;s promise of access</a> to user data under a system known as the &ldquo;Graph API.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>From 2010 until April 30, 2015, the Graph API gave all Facebook apps access to a vast dataset of not only individual users, but their friends as well. This trove included private messages, check-ins, events, locations, relationships, and &mdash; crucially for Six4Three &mdash; photos.</p>\n<p>Six4Three&rsquo;s app, Pikinis, and thousands of other apps of that era, such as Tinder and Vine, were predicated on having relatively easy access to Facebook user data.</p>\n<p>But then, in April 2014, Facebook announced that it would make the Graph API far less permissive, removing apps&rsquo; access to the data.

According to leaked documents from the Six4Three lawsuit, Zuckerberg began efforts to shut down apps&rsquo; access to user data in 2011 and 2012 &mdash; several months before Six4Three was founded.</p>\n<p>If Facebook had been transparent about those efforts, &ldquo;then Six4Three never would have started its business,&rdquo; Kramer said.</p>\n<p>Among a long list of things that Six4Three has <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5775209-CIV533328-12.html#document/p106/a493727\">asked</a> the court to impose is a restoration of the earlier version of the more permissive Graph API. That&rsquo;s something Facebook has vowed not to do.</p>\n<p>A Facebook spokeswoman noted that the Pikinis app had not even fully launched in the spring of 2014 when the company announced that apps&rsquo; access to user data would be shut down.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/inside-bikini-photo-startup-six4three-s-scrappy-battle-put-facebook-n995016\">HOW TED KRAMER STARTED SIX4THREE</a></h3>\n<p>Kramer didn&rsquo;t set out to become Facebook&rsquo;s antagonist. In fact, he began his career as a baseball player.</p>\n<p>In 2007, after he finished college, <a href=\"http://stats.baseball-softball.de/archive/2007/1bls/?y=7&f=gl330\">Kramer played one season for the Haar Disciples</a>, a professional baseball team outside Munich. (The name of his startup is a nod to his love of America&rsquo;s pastime: a &ldquo;six-four-three double play.&rdquo;)</p>\n<p>Kramer returned home to New York in 2007 and soon began working as a teacher. He later joined his high school friend Thomas Scaramellino&rsquo;s energy software company, Efficiency 2.0. After the startup sold to a larger company, Kramer joined WeWork in 2013 and oversaw the rollout of its co-working spaces to new cities across the United States and Europe.</p>\n<p>Shortly before starting at WeWork, Kramer attended a meetup group in New York focused on machine learning. He was &ldquo;enthralled&rdquo; by a professor&rsquo;s talk on visual pattern recognition software that could automatically classify species of birds.</p>\n<p>This fascination led him to found Six4Three in late 2012, using $250,000 in funding from Scaramellino. He built the company while employed at WeWork.</p>\n<p>Scaramellino declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Kramer said he didn&rsquo;t set out to create an app to find bikini photos &mdash; he initially wanted an app to find sports logos and other brand icons.</p>\n<p>The plan, Kramer said, was to use Facebook photos to train software that could do this. He chose to focus on an &ldquo;admittedly low-brow&rdquo; application as a provocative way to get young adults to consent to sharing their Facebook photos, he said.</p>\n<p>Pikinis soft-launched in 2013 and received some <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/new-pikinis-app-helps-creeps-find-your-bikini-pics-with-479775602\">media coverage</a> characterizing the app <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/25/pikinis-app-facebook-bikini-pictures_n_3154275.html\">as &ldquo;creepy</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Facebook received no complaints about the app while it was live, according to the leaked internal documents, and never sent Six4Three any notices of privacy violations, according to Kramer.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Facebook continues to tell the court and the media that it shut down Six4Three because it was a sketchy app and wanted access to data that Facebook had locked down allegedly for privacy reasons,&rdquo; Kramer said. &ldquo;That is complete pablum. It&rsquo;s simply not what happened.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A Facebook spokeswoman told NBC News that the company did not mislead Six4Three or other app developers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They claim that we promised developers unrestricted access to data forever, which is not true,&rdquo; the spokeswoman said.</p>\n<p>Facebook has previously <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5805784-CIV533328-35.html#document/p13/a493064\">noted</a> that Six4Three attracted only $412 in app download sales.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/inside-bikini-photo-startup-six4three-s-scrappy-battle-put-facebook-n995016\">FEW ALLIES FOR SIX4THREE</a></h3>\n<p>Six4Three has sought allies in its legal fight, starting a <a href=\"https://www.facebooksappeconomy.com/\">website</a> inviting aggrieved companies to its side. (Facebook characterized the website as &ldquo;slander.&rdquo;)</p>\n<p>But Six4Three has had a tough time drawing support for two reasons: First, Pikinis is a hard app to defend, and second, few want to take on one of the largest companies in the world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://consumersunion.org/experts/justin-brookman/\">Justin Brookman</a>, a former Federal Trade Commission lawyer who is now the director of consumer privacy and technology policy at the Consumers Union, was blunt: &ldquo;This app should not exist. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He added that while he agrees with Six4Three that Facebook&rsquo;s strategy should be scrutinized, the company does not make a sympathetic victim. Even Facebook skeptics may find reasons not to side with Six4Three, he said. &ldquo;If Cambridge Analytica was suing Facebook for stopping access, I also don&rsquo;t think they would get allies, no matter how Facebook may be annoying or making bad choices,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The enemy of my enemy is not always my friend.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Kramer said that Six4Three has received supportive emails and phone calls from startup founders and investors. But few have been willing to publicly denounce the company over fears that it could jeopardize their relationship with the platform, according to both court filings and NBC News&rsquo; private conversations with several founders.</p>\n<p>Ali and Hadi Partovi, the entrepreneur and investor brothers who co-founded the learn-to-code platform <a href=\"https://code.org/\">Code.org</a>, for example, expressed sympathy with Six4Three in emails and depositions included in court filings.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Confidentially, Ali and I agree with a lot of this, and it was a very emotional and trying experience to bet our company on the Facebook platform, only to see the platform turn into quicksand and see our investment lose value overnight,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5772288-CIV533328-11.html#document/p19/a492034\">Hadi Partovi said in an email</a> to Six4Three&rsquo;s attorney <a href=\"https://www.birnbaumgodkin.com/davidgodkin.php\">David Godkin</a> in August 2017 that referred to the difficulties the brothers had when their music startup iLike worked with Facebook in the 2000s.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;However, given our personal relationships with Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg, I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;d want to be part of a formal litigation effort,&rdquo; Partovi said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have much more to lose than to gain.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In 2016, Facebook <a href=\"https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-07-14-facebook-donates-15m-to-code-org-to-diversify-computer-science-education\">donated</a> $15 million to the brothers&rsquo; Code.org nonprofit.</p>\n<p>Hadi Partovi released a statement to NBC News: &quot;While most people who bet on the early Facebook Platform last decade felt badly about the outcome, Facebook probably lost the most after investing in a platform that didn&rsquo;t live up to its potential. I trust that Sheryl and Mark gained valuable lessons and will draw on this experience in the future. I have moved on, and I&rsquo;m sure so have others.&quot;</p>\n<p>A Facebook spokeswoman said of Six4Three: &ldquo;The idea that they can&rsquo;t get anyone to join them because of personal relationships is ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Only a handful of startups affected by Facebook&rsquo;s platform changes have been willing to speak on the record about the case.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not super excited to say that I&rsquo;m going to get in the ring with Facebook, because I have a company to build and they have a lot more money than me,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nicksoman\">Nick Soman</a>, the former CEO of the matchmaking app LikeBright and current CEO of health care startup <a href=\"https://www.decent.com/\">Decent</a>, told NBC News.</p>\n<p>Only one other startup &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5433610-Styleform-IT-v-Facebook.html\">Styleform IT, a one-person company based in Sweden &mdash; has brought a lawsuit like Six4Three&rsquo;s</a>. Filed in state court in San Francisco, that case&rsquo;s next hearing is scheduled for June. Facebook reiterated earlier comments that Styleform IT&rsquo;s lawsuit was &ldquo;meritless.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/inside-bikini-photo-startup-six4three-s-scrappy-battle-put-facebook-n995016\">&lsquo;MY REPUTATION IS AT RISK&rsquo;</a></h3>\n<p>While Kramer and Scaramellino have been struggling to bolster their ranks, they have hurt their own cause. Months before Six4Three&rsquo;s lawsuit was set to go to trial in April 2019, Kramer angered the judge overseeing the case late last year after releasing a cache of sealed documents to a British member of Parliament.</p>\n<p>In the run-up to a business trip to London last fall, Kramer was given a series of parliamentary orders to hand over a set of private documents that were part of the ongoing Six4Three lawsuit. While Kramer initially said that he could not provide them as they were under seal by the court, he eventually <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5772288-CIV533328-11.html#document/p880/a488174\">complied</a>. That decision set off a legal firestorm in California, particularly after the member of Parliament, Damian Collins, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5753442-Note-by-Chair-and-Selected-Documents-Ordered.html\">published</a> many of the sealed documents.</p>\n<p>The San Mateo County judge hearing the Six4Three case called Kramer&rsquo;s release of sealed documents a &ldquo;compromise of the integrity of our litigation system&rdquo; during a hearing last month.</p>\n<p>Since the London episode, Six4Three&rsquo;s lawyers have tried to quit. Kramer and Scaramellino have tried to find alternate lawyers to represent Six4Three, but Kramer said that the first six firms they approached would not take on the case because of a conflict: They already count Facebook as a client.</p>\n<p>Facebook says the implication that the company has blocked Six4Three&rsquo;s ability to hire new counsel is &ldquo;ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After NBC News contacted Facebook for comment on the documents leaked to NBC News and the Six4Three case, Facebook&rsquo;s lawyers wrote to the judge, claiming that Six4Three had leaked the documents to a &ldquo;national broadcast network&rdquo; and seeking to depose Six4Three&rsquo;s founders.

                "text": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif. \u2014 Ted Kramer seemed on edge. While sitting at a Starbucks store recently talking to a reporter, he kept looking over his shoulder mid-conversation, scanning people and cars passing by.\nFor years, Kramer, 35, founder of the now-defunct startup app developer Six4Three, has been involved in a high-stakes legal battle with Facebook. He suspects the technology company has hired people to surveil him, because he says he has seen people taking photos outside his San Francisco apartment.\nFacebook says the surveillance claim is \u201cabsolute fantasy\u201d and denied monitoring Kramer.\nKramer\u2019s concern is far from the most bizarre thing about his lawsuit, which has prompted an investigation by the British Parliament and shows no sign of resolution.\nThe David vs. Goliath contest pits Kramer\u2019s small startup, which in 2013 built a short-lived app to identify Facebook photos of users\u2019 friends in bikinis, against one of the most powerful technology companies in the world. Six4Three sued Facebook in 2015 in state court in San Mateo County after Facebook restricted its access to the user data that its app, called Pikinis, and thousands of other apps, relied on to function.\nThe case started small, and initially attracted little notice beyond tech blogs, but it has grown into a massive headache for Facebook. Over the course of the case, the social media giant was forced to turn over thousands of pages of internal documents, which show Facebook\u2019s years-long efforts to control its competitors by sharing or withholding Facebook user data. The documents \u2014 some of which were published by the British Parliament last year and more of which were recently obtained by Duncan Campbell, a British journalist who shared them with NBC News and other media outlets \u2014 show how Facebook publicly described its decisions as driven by user privacy concerns, while the company was actually focused on threats from competitors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we are fishing in this tiny boat with no one else around and we somehow managed to hook a massive great white shark on our line,\u201d Kramer said in his first extensive public comments on the case, a lengthy emailed response to questions that were screened by his attorney. The emails were exchanged between meetings in San Francisco and Redwood City.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kept it on the line for four years and have been slowly but surely reeling it in,\u201d Kramer continued in one of the emails. \u201cThe more we reel it in, the more tricks it finds to try to yank itself off the line. But it\u2019s still on that line. It has almost tipped our boat over a few times and it may end up tipping the boat over very soon. But we will hold onto that rod even while drowning. We\u2019ll keep pulling that line in. We might go down, but the shark\u2019s coming with us.\"\nFacebook reiterated its view that Six4Three\u2019s lawsuit is \u201cmeritless\u201d and in an emailed statement questioned the startup\u2019s claims about what the internal documents show.\n\u201cAs we've said many times, Six4Three \u2014 creators of the Pikinis app \u2014 cherry-picked these documents from years ago as part of a lawsuit to force Facebook to share information on friends of the app's users,\u201d Paul Grewal, Facebook\u2019s deputy general counsel, told NBC News in a statement. \u201cThe set of documents, by design, tells only one side of the story and omits important context. We still stand by the platform changes we made in 2014/2015 to prevent people from sharing their friends' information with developers like the creators of Pikinis.\u201d\nNBC News has not been able to determine whether the documents represent a complete picture. Facebook declined to provide additional evidence to support its view that they were cherry-picked.\nFacebook has publicly painted Six4Three as an unsuccessful company that sought to exploit the same privacy vulnerabilities in Facebook\u2019s platform as the data-harvesting boogeyman Cambridge Analytica.\nBut some experts believe the significance of Kramer\u2019s lawsuit goes far beyond an app that might be viewed as unsavory.\n\u201cTed is at the center of one of the most important questions of our decade: How can personal information and privacy be used to harm competition?\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, who previously served as the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s chief technologist and is now an independent privacy researcher based in Oakland, California.\nStill, Kramer\u2019s crusade has found few public allies in the tech industry.\nAt least half a dozen prominent investors and startup founders told NBC News in private conversations that they\u2019re rooting for Six4Three, but that they would not say anything publicly that could harm their relationship with the social network.\nAs a result of the lawsuit, Kramer fears becoming an outcast in Silicon Valley. But his goal has not changed: to put Facebook\u2019s entire business model on trial \u2014 particularly what he views as the company\u2019s bait-and-switch of offering Facebook user data to apps like Pikinis and then removing it.\n\u201cThis is all because I am standing up for what is right and trying to hold Facebook accountable for its fraud,\u201d Kramer said in an email, \u201csomething state and federal governments should have done a long time ago.\u201d\nSIX4THREE\u2019S CASE AGAINST FACEBOOK\nSix4Three\u2019s legal case is relatively simple: The startup alleges Facebook never gave it a fair chance to compete.\nSix4Three argued in its 2015 complaint that it created a business model in 2013 based on Facebook\u2019s promise of access to user data under a system known as the \u201cGraph API.\u201d\nFrom 2010 until April 30, 2015, the Graph API gave all Facebook apps access to a vast dataset of not only individual users, but their friends as well. This trove included private messages, check-ins, events, locations, relationships, and \u2014 crucially for Six4Three \u2014 photos.\nSix4Three\u2019s app, Pikinis, and thousands of other apps of that era, such as Tinder and Vine, were predicated on having relatively easy access to Facebook user data.\nBut then, in April 2014, Facebook announced that it would make the Graph API far less permissive, removing apps\u2019 access to the data. All older apps were given a year to retool.\nSix4Three sued on April 10, 2015, 20 days before the older version of Graph API was shut down.\nIn Six4Three\u2019s most recent amended complaint, filed in January 2018, the startup accuses Facebook of a \u201cseries of fraudulent and anti-competitive schemes\u201d designed by its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. According to leaked documents from the Six4Three lawsuit, Zuckerberg began efforts to shut down apps\u2019 access to user data in 2011 and 2012 \u2014 several months before Six4Three was founded.\nIf Facebook had been transparent about those efforts, \u201cthen Six4Three never would have started its business,\u201d Kramer said.\nAmong a long list of things that Six4Three has asked the court to impose is a restoration of the earlier version of the more permissive Graph API. That\u2019s something Facebook has vowed not to do.\nA Facebook spokeswoman noted that the Pikinis app had not even fully launched in the spring of 2014 when the company announced that apps\u2019 access to user data would be shut down.\nHOW TED KRAMER STARTED SIX4THREE\nKramer didn\u2019t set out to become Facebook\u2019s antagonist. In fact, he began his career as a baseball player.\nIn 2007, after he finished college, Kramer played one season for the Haar Disciples, a professional baseball team outside Munich. (The name of his startup is a nod to his love of America\u2019s pastime: a \u201csix-four-three double play.\u201d)\nKramer returned home to New York in 2007 and soon began working as a teacher. He later joined his high school friend Thomas Scaramellino\u2019s energy software company, Efficiency 2.0. After the startup sold to a larger company, Kramer joined WeWork in 2013 and oversaw the rollout of its co-working spaces to new cities across the United States and Europe.\nShortly before starting at WeWork, Kramer attended a meetup group in New York focused on machine learning. He was \u201centhralled\u201d by a professor\u2019s talk on visual pattern recognition software that could automatically classify species of birds.\nThis fascination led him to found Six4Three in late 2012, using $250,000 in funding from Scaramellino. He built the company while employed at WeWork.\nScaramellino declined to comment.\nKramer said he didn\u2019t set out to create an app to find bikini photos \u2014 he initially wanted an app to find sports logos and other brand icons.\nThe plan, Kramer said, was to use Facebook photos to train software that could do this. He chose to focus on an \u201cadmittedly low-brow\u201d application as a provocative way to get young adults to consent to sharing their Facebook photos, he said.\nPikinis soft-launched in 2013 and received some media coverage characterizing the app as \u201ccreepy.\u201d\nBut Facebook received no complaints about the app while it was live, according to the leaked internal documents, and never sent Six4Three any notices of privacy violations, according to Kramer.\n\u201cFacebook continues to tell the court and the media that it shut down Six4Three because it was a sketchy app and wanted access to data that Facebook had locked down allegedly for privacy reasons,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThat is complete pablum. It\u2019s simply not what happened.\u201d\nA Facebook spokeswoman told NBC News that the company did not mislead Six4Three or other app developers.\n\u201cThey claim that we promised developers unrestricted access to data forever, which is not true,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\nFacebook has previously noted that Six4Three attracted only $412 in app download sales.\nFEW ALLIES FOR SIX4THREE\nSix4Three has sought allies in its legal fight, starting a website inviting aggrieved companies to its side. (Facebook characterized the website as \u201cslander.\u201d)\nBut Six4Three has had a tough time drawing support for two reasons: First, Pikinis is a hard app to defend, and second, few want to take on one of the largest companies in the world.\nJustin Brookman, a former Federal Trade Commission lawyer who is now the director of consumer privacy and technology policy at the Consumers Union, was blunt: \u201cThis app should not exist. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nHe added that while he agrees with Six4Three that Facebook\u2019s strategy should be scrutinized, the company does not make a sympathetic victim. Even Facebook skeptics may find reasons not to side with Six4Three, he said. \u201cIf Cambridge Analytica was suing Facebook for stopping access, I also don\u2019t think they would get allies, no matter how Facebook may be annoying or making bad choices,\u201d he said. \u201cThe enemy of my enemy is not always my friend.\u201d\nKramer said that Six4Three has received supportive emails and phone calls from startup founders and investors. But few have been willing to publicly denounce the company over fears that it could jeopardize their relationship with the platform, according to both court filings and NBC News\u2019 private conversations with several founders.\nAli and Hadi Partovi, the entrepreneur and investor brothers who co-founded the learn-to-code platform Code.org, for example, expressed sympathy with Six4Three in emails and depositions included in court filings.\n\u201cConfidentially, Ali and I agree with a lot of this, and it was a very emotional and trying experience to bet our company on the Facebook platform, only to see the platform turn into quicksand and see our investment lose value overnight,\u201d Hadi Partovi said in an email to Six4Three\u2019s attorney David Godkin in August 2017 that referred to the difficulties the brothers had when their music startup iLike worked with Facebook in the 2000s.\n\u201cHowever, given our personal relationships with Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019d want to be part of a formal litigation effort,\u201d Partovi said. \u201cWe\u2019d have much more to lose than to gain.\u201d\nIn 2016, Facebook donated $15 million to the brothers\u2019 Code.org nonprofit.\nHadi Partovi released a statement to NBC News: \"While most people who bet on the early Facebook Platform last decade felt badly about the outcome, Facebook probably lost the most after investing in a platform that didn\u2019t live up to its potential. I trust that Sheryl and Mark gained valuable lessons and will draw on this experience in the future. I have moved on, and I\u2019m sure so have others.\"\nA Facebook spokeswoman said of Six4Three: \u201cThe idea that they can\u2019t get anyone to join them because of personal relationships is ridiculous.\u201d\nOnly a handful of startups affected by Facebook\u2019s platform changes have been willing to speak on the record about the case.\n\u201cI\u2019m not super excited to say that I\u2019m going to get in the ring with Facebook, because I have a company to build and they have a lot more money than me,\u201d Nick Soman, the former CEO of the matchmaking app LikeBright and current CEO of health care startup Decent, told NBC News.\nOnly one other startup \u2014 Styleform IT, a one-person company based in Sweden \u2014 has brought a lawsuit like Six4Three\u2019s. Filed in state court in San Francisco, that case\u2019s next hearing is scheduled for June. Facebook reiterated earlier comments that Styleform IT\u2019s lawsuit was \u201cmeritless.\u201d\n\u2018MY REPUTATION IS AT RISK\u2019\nWhile Kramer and Scaramellino have been struggling to bolster their ranks, they have hurt their own cause. Months before Six4Three\u2019s lawsuit was set to go to trial in April 2019, Kramer angered the judge overseeing the case late last year after releasing a cache of sealed documents to a British member of Parliament.\nIn the run-up to a business trip to London last fall, Kramer was given a series of parliamentary orders to hand over a set of private documents that were part of the ongoing Six4Three lawsuit. While Kramer initially said that he could not provide them as they were under seal by the court, he eventually complied. That decision set off a legal firestorm in California, particularly after the member of Parliament, Damian Collins, published many of the sealed documents.\nThe San Mateo County judge hearing the Six4Three case called Kramer\u2019s release of sealed documents a \u201ccompromise of the integrity of our litigation system\u201d during a hearing last month.\nSince the London episode, Six4Three\u2019s lawyers have tried to quit. Kramer and Scaramellino have tried to find alternate lawyers to represent Six4Three, but Kramer said that the first six firms they approached would not take on the case because of a conflict: They already count Facebook as a client.\nFacebook says the implication that the company has blocked Six4Three\u2019s ability to hire new counsel is \u201cridiculous.\u201d\nAfter NBC News contacted Facebook for comment on the documents leaked to NBC News and the Six4Three case, Facebook\u2019s lawyers wrote to the judge, claiming that Six4Three had leaked the documents to a \u201cnational broadcast network\u201d and seeking to depose Six4Three\u2019s founders. Six4Three denied leaking the documents.\nKramer is trying to build a new co-working office space startup, but he says the legal battle has left him on the brink of personal bankruptcy.\n\u201cIt means my new business is at risk, living in San Francisco is at risk, acting as a consultant is at risk, my reputation is at risk, finding employment is at risk,\u201d Kramer told NBC News.\nFacebook, he said, wants \u201cto financially destroy me and everyone associated with Six4Three\u2019s efforts before the full truth can be exposed in front of a jury at trial.\u201d (Facebook said that Kramer\u2019s claim that the company is trying to ruin him and his associates is also \u201cridiculous.\u201d)\nNonetheless, Six4Three is pressing on.\n\u201cThe past few months have been extremely stressful,\u201d Kramer said, \u201cbut the way I handle that is by continuing to remind myself that I am doing the right thing, and giving up is not an option.\u201d",

But, in the lead up to this second summit, he has repeatedly stressed that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/20/696413632/whats-changed-between-u-s-and-north-korea-since-first-summit\">he's not setting a deadline for North Korea to act</a>.</p>\n<p>&quot;I think a lot can come from it &mdash; at least, I hope so &mdash; the denuclearization, ultimately,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-signing-ceremony-space-policy-directive-4/\">Trump said</a> at a White House event last week. &quot;I'm in no particular rush. The sanctions are on; the relationships are very strong, and a lot of good things have happened.&quot;</p>\n<p>This was not always the case. After Trump's historic meeting with Kim in June 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo floated a goal of getting North Korea to give up its weapons by January 2021.</p>\n<p>Trump put a stop to that talk, however. In September of last year, Trump told reporters that he had directed Pompeo to not <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/26/president-trumps-un-press-conference-annotated/?utm_term=.059b50f8122e\">&quot;get into the time game.&quot;</a></p>\n<p>&quot;If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter. There's no nuclear testing and there's not testing of rockets,&quot; Trump said.</p>\n<p>Despite Trump's insistence that he's not in a hurry, administration officials say he's urged his negotiators to try to get North Korea to agree to concrete steps.</p>\n<p>The administration has offered few details ahead of the summit, which officially takes place Feb. 27 and 28, but the format will be similar to the talks held in Singapore in June 2018.</p>\n<p>Trump and Kim are expected to meet with each other one-on-one and to participate in sessions with expanded bilateral delegations, and Trump has now arrived in Vietnam.</p>\n<p><strong>What does denuclearization mean?</strong></p>\n<p>A major point of dispute over the years between the U.S. and North Korea has been that the two sides have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/20/696413639/second-u-s-north-korea-summit-likely-focus-on-nuclear-weapons-center\">different perceptions of what denuclearization would actually mean</a>.</p>\n<p>In the past, North Korea has argued that the U.S. should also remove any nuclear weapons it has deployed in the region.</p>\n<p>Officials participating in lower-level negotiations in preparation for the summit say they are working to reach a &quot;shared understanding&quot; on this point.</p>\n<p>One criticism of Trump and Kim's initial meeting was that it only produced a vague agreement, with little in the way of specifics.</p>\n<p>But Jessica Lee, a senior director of the <a href=\"http://councilka.org/\">Council of Korean Americans</a>, says there may be some benefit to lowering expectations about quick results.</p>\n<p>&quot;Both the United States and North Korea have to be a little bit less ambitious and more realistic when it comes to outcome, knowing that the eventual goal of eliminating nuclear weapons in North Korea is going to be something that takes years, if not decades,&quot; Lee said.</p>\n<p>After years of basically no diplomatic ties and rising tensions, Lee said it's important to establish a dialogue.</p>\n<p>&quot;Given the kind of country we're dealing with in terms of their nuclear and missile capability, it's absolutely prudent to develop channels of communication and to talk rather than pursue other means of resolving our differences,&quot; she added.</p>\n<p>Some experts have raised concerns that Trump may <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/06/692115790/trump-to-meet-with-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-in-vietnam\">bargain away too much</a> in search of a pact with North Korea. There had been some worry that Trump might agree to remove U.S. troops from the peninsula in exchange for action from Pyongyang.</p>\n<p>But, Trump said Friday that troop draw downs are not &quot;on the table.&quot;</p>\n<p>Fred Fleitz, a former chief of staff to national security adviser John Bolton, says he does not think Trump will agree to any easing of sanctions at the Vietnam meeting. Before that happens, Fleitz believes North Korea will have to take substantial steps toward giving up its weapons.</p>\n<p>Fleitz said it's possible that the administration might be willing to open an official liaison office in North Korea, which would open the door to diplomatic relations.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's such a minor concession, but for the North Koreans it might be important,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>The White House acknowledges that eventually North Korea's Kim will have to make a decision about whether he's serious about abandoning his country's nuclear program.</p>\n<p>While talks may hold off the immediate threat of a military conflict, they also give North Korea time to continue to develop its arsenal.</p>\n<p>If North Korea wants to change its status with the U.S., Frank Aum, of the U.S. Institute of Peace, says the country cannot keep its weapons.</p>\n<p>&quot;I don't think the U.S. would agree to have normalized relations and accept North Korea back into the fold as a responsible member of the international community until North Korea denuclearizes,&quot; Aum said.</p>",

                "text": "President Trump will meet with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un this week in Vietnam, as he attempts to get Pyongyang to move toward what has been an elusive goal: complete denuclearization.\nTrump has maintained that his ultimate goal is to get Kim to relinquish the regime's nuclear program. But, in the lead up to this second summit, he has repeatedly stressed that he's not setting a deadline for North Korea to act.\n\"I think a lot can come from it \u2014 at least, I hope so \u2014 the denuclearization, ultimately,\" Trump said at a White House event last week. \"I'm in no particular rush. The sanctions are on; the relationships are very strong, and a lot of good things have happened.\"\nThis was not always the case. After Trump's historic meeting with Kim in June 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo floated a goal of getting North Korea to give up its weapons by January 2021.\nTrump put a stop to that talk, however. In September of last year, Trump told reporters that he had directed Pompeo to not \"get into the time game.\"\n\"If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter. There's no nuclear testing and there's not testing of rockets,\" Trump said.\nDespite Trump's insistence that he's not in a hurry, administration officials say he's urged his negotiators to try to get North Korea to agree to concrete steps.\nThe administration has offered few details ahead of the summit, which officially takes place Feb. 27 and 28, but the format will be similar to the talks held in Singapore in June 2018.\nTrump and Kim are expected to meet with each other one-on-one and to participate in sessions with expanded bilateral delegations, and Trump has now arrived in Vietnam.\nWhat does denuclearization mean?\nA major point of dispute over the years between the U.S. and North Korea has been that the two sides have different perceptions of what denuclearization would actually mean.\nIn the past, North Korea has argued that the U.S. should also remove any nuclear weapons it has deployed in the region.\nOfficials participating in lower-level negotiations in preparation for the summit say they are working to reach a \"shared understanding\" on this point.\nOne criticism of Trump and Kim's initial meeting was that it only produced a vague agreement, with little in the way of specifics.\nBut Jessica Lee, a senior director of the Council of Korean Americans, says there may be some benefit to lowering expectations about quick results.\n\"Both the United States and North Korea have to be a little bit less ambitious and more realistic when it comes to outcome, knowing that the eventual goal of eliminating nuclear weapons in North Korea is going to be something that takes years, if not decades,\" Lee said.\nAfter years of basically no diplomatic ties and rising tensions, Lee said it's important to establish a dialogue.\n\"Given the kind of country we're dealing with in terms of their nuclear and missile capability, it's absolutely prudent to develop channels of communication and to talk rather than pursue other means of resolving our differences,\" she added.\nSome experts have raised concerns that Trump may bargain away too much in search of a pact with North Korea. There had been some worry that Trump might agree to remove U.S. troops from the peninsula in exchange for action from Pyongyang.\nBut, Trump said Friday that troop draw downs are not \"on the table.\"\nFred Fleitz, a former chief of staff to national security adviser John Bolton, says he does not think Trump will agree to any easing of sanctions at the Vietnam meeting. Before that happens, Fleitz believes North Korea will have to take substantial steps toward giving up its weapons.\nFleitz said it's possible that the administration might be willing to open an official liaison office in North Korea, which would open the door to diplomatic relations.\n\"It's such a minor concession, but for the North Koreans it might be important,\" he said.\nThe White House acknowledges that eventually North Korea's Kim will have to make a decision about whether he's serious about abandoning his country's nuclear program.\nWhile talks may hold off the immediate threat of a military conflict, they also give North Korea time to continue to develop its arsenal.\nIf North Korea wants to change its status with the U.S., Frank Aum, of the U.S. Institute of Peace, says the country cannot keep its weapons.\n\"I don't think the U.S. would agree to have normalized relations and accept North Korea back into the fold as a responsible member of the international community until North Korea denuclearizes,\" Aum said.",

The political stakes are high for both Democrats and Republicans.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Members of Congress have some questions this week for Michael Cohen.</p>\n<p>President Trump's former personal lawyer is set to begin a three-day marathon on Tuesday that will take him behind closed doors with the Senate intelligence committee, then before an open session of the House oversight committee on Wednesday and then to a closed House intelligence committee session on Thursday.</p>\n<p>The public hearing on Wednesday could become a three-ring spectacle and will be the first big televised show for an oversight committee that has vowed to spend the next two years on intense investigations of Trump.</p>\n<p>With Cohen, Democrats want to tease out evidence of wrongdoing by Trump while Republicans want to damage Cohen's credibility so much that no one can believe anything he says.</p>\n<p>The situation is more complicated than simple politics as usual, however: Members are supposed to be bound by guidelines agreed to with the Justice Department about the topics Cohen can discuss.</p>\n<p>Oversight committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said that Russia's interference in the 2016 election will be off limits but members may ask Cohen about &quot;the president's payoffs, financial disclosures, compliance with campaign finance laws, business practices, and other matters.&quot;</p>\n<p>Those &quot;other matters&quot; could include the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/17/686182230/trumps-ex-lawyer-cohen-acknowledges-scheme-to-rig-polls-in-presidential-race\">online polls in 2014 and 2015 that Cohen admitted rigging</a> to help Trump's presidential aspirations, or the prospect of illicit foreign contributions to Trump's inauguration committee, or the access to Trump that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/05/11/610419846/at-t-admits-mistake-in-hiring-trump-lawyer-top-company-lobbyist-steps-down\">Cohen sold to big corporate clients</a> in 2017.</p>\n<p>Republicans have their own agenda.</p>\n<p><strong>Lots to discuss with lawmakers</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/08/21/640544009/donald-trumps-longtime-attorney-michael-cohen-reaches-plea-deal-with-feds\">Cohen has pleaded guilty to a number of crimes</a>, including arranging payments to two women ahead of Election Day in 2016 to buy their silence about alleged sexual relationships with Trump from years before.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/05/02/607943366/giuliani-says-trump-did-know-about-stormy-daniels-payment\">Trump has acknowledged a payment to one woman</a> but denies the underlying allegations by both women about sexual relationships.</p>\n<p>The president also argues that the actions Cohen admitted in his plea deal, which implicated Trump, weren't against the law &mdash; that he, in effect, pleaded guilty to crimes that aren't crimes. The judge in his case, however, supervised the plea and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/12/676040070/michael-cohen-sentenced-to-3-years-in-prison-following-plea-that-implicated-trum\">sentenced Cohen to three years in prison</a>.</p>\n<p>Cohen was scheduled to report to prison early next month but sought an extension, citing his recovery from shoulder surgery and the need to prepare for this week's extended visit to Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/11/29/671864979/trump-moscow-real-estate-talks-continued-into-presidential-run-documents-show\">Cohen also has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress</a> about the negotiations he conducted on behalf of Trump's business with powerful Russians as part of a potential Trump Tower real estate project in Moscow.</p>\n<p>Cohen first told lawmakers those talks wound up in early 2016, when actually they continued well into the campaign &mdash; almost to the point at which Trump became the Republican nominee for president.</p>\n<p>That meant Trump's business was continuing to negotiate with Russians even as the Russian government had launched its campaign of &quot;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/04/25/586099619/the-russia-investigations-what-you-need-to-know-about-russian-active-measures\">active measures</a>&quot; against the presidential election &mdash; and even as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/politics/fact-check-cohen-trump-.html\">Trump was denying, in 2016, that he had any dealings with Russia</a>.</p>\n<p>The president has since said that he decided on his own <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-marine-one-departure-27/\">not to go forward with Trump Tower Moscow</a> and that his denials were appropriate because there was no final deal. The building was never built.</p>\n<p><strong>A likely minefield</strong></p>\n<p>The challenge for Cummings and the other members of the oversight committee may be in navigating which subject matters fall on which side of the line they have drawn with Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller.</p>\n<p>Cohen, meanwhile, may offer implicit clues about which areas are connected with alleged collusion in the questions that he agrees to answer and those to which he demurs.</p>\n<p>The degree to which he addresses Trump Tower Moscow, for example, could offer suggestions about how closely it may be connected with the focus of Mueller's investigators.</p>\n<p>And Republicans on the oversight committee &mdash; many of whom are hostile toward Mueller, the Justice Department and Cohen &mdash; may not necessarily feel bound by any ground rules.</p>\n<p>Ranking member Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has vowed that Republicans will ask what they want to ask.</p>\n<p>&quot;I have serious process concerns with this hearing,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;I will not stand by quietly while an admitted liar comes before the committee. Our members intend to question Mr. Cohen about the crimes he pleaded guilty to, other criminal activity he participated in but refused to disclose, his international financial dealings, and a long list of other probative activities.&quot;</p>\n<p>The intricate procedural ground on which this battle is to be fought may make the Wednesday session another master class in congressional procedure. Republicans may attempt to use points of order, objections or other roadblocks to try to adjourn or constrain the proceedings.</p>\n<p>Democrats can use their majority to keep the show going, but if they must take recorded votes or other procedural steps each time there is an objection, that could mean the Cohen hearing lasts for hours.</p>\n<p>Democrats tried to use their own objections, points of order and other procedural obstacles when Republicans controlled the majority in the House, including at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee with former FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok.</p>\n<p>Now the shoe is on the other foot.</p>\n<p><strong>A witness &mdash; but for whom?</strong></p>\n<p>Cohen is a politically problematic witness for both Democrats and Republicans.</p>\n<p>His admissions about lying mean there is often scope for one side or the other to discount something he has said. Even prosecutors involved in his plea agreement in New York City complained they believed Cohen had more knowledge about wrongdoing than he admitted.</p>\n<p>Exhibit A could be the role described for him in the infamous, partly unverified <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/04/25/586040491/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-russia-investigations-the-dossier\">Russia dossier</a> that appeared in early 2017, earlier in the Russia imbroglio.</p>\n<p>NPR has never detailed the document because so much of it remains unproved, but, in general terms, it describes travel by Cohen as part of an alleged conspiracy between Trump's inner circle and the Russian attack on the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Cohen told Congress on an earlier visit, when he was still loyal to Trump, that he denied that account. He also has said publicly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelCohen212/status/1078400493494390784\">several times since</a> then that he didn't take part in the travel described in the dossier.</p>\n<p>Cohen's denial helps Republicans who are eager to dismiss the dossier as baseless rumormongering and to undercut the basic premise of the Russia investigation being conducted by Mueller &mdash; that people like Cohen, working for Trump, may have colluded with the Russians.</p>\n<p>But the degree to which Jordan or other Republican members attempt to reinforce those denials by Cohen complicates attempts to paint him as a liar in other ways &mdash; although that may not stop individual members from pursuing their own lines of questioning.</p>\n<p>The inverse is true for Democrats and opponents of Trump: Cohen's denials about his travel were met with deep skepticism among people who believe the evidence is already clear about alleged collusion.</p>\n<p>NPR asked Cummings on Monday whether he expected Cohen would be a credible witness.</p>\n<p>&quot;We don't know,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>But the public clearly has an interest in getting his testimony on the record in the open, Cummings said.</p>\n<p>&quot;I practiced law for more than 20 years and you have a situation where a man, apparently, wants to bare his soul and talk about his relationship with this president,&quot; he told NPR's <em>All Things Considered</em>.</p>\n<p>&quot;But keep in mind, Michael Cohen is the one person who has accused the president of committing a crime. It's hard to say what's going to happen. But the good thing about it is that members of Congress will have an opportunity to observe him. The public will have an opportunity to observe him. And I think that's a good thing.&quot;</p>",

                "text": "Members of Congress have some questions this week for Michael Cohen.\nPresident Trump's former personal lawyer is set to begin a three-day marathon on Tuesday that will take him behind closed doors with the Senate intelligence committee, then before an open session of the House oversight committee on Wednesday and then to a closed House intelligence committee session on Thursday.\nThe public hearing on Wednesday could become a three-ring spectacle and will be the first big televised show for an oversight committee that has vowed to spend the next two years on intense investigations of Trump.\nWith Cohen, Democrats want to tease out evidence of wrongdoing by Trump while Republicans want to damage Cohen's credibility so much that no one can believe anything he says.\nThe situation is more complicated than simple politics as usual, however: Members are supposed to be bound by guidelines agreed to with the Justice Department about the topics Cohen can discuss.\nOversight committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said that Russia's interference in the 2016 election will be off limits but members may ask Cohen about \"the president's payoffs, financial disclosures, compliance with campaign finance laws, business practices, and other matters.\"\nThose \"other matters\" could include the online polls in 2014 and 2015 that Cohen admitted rigging to help Trump's presidential aspirations, or the prospect of illicit foreign contributions to Trump's inauguration committee, or the access to Trump that Cohen sold to big corporate clients in 2017.\nRepublicans have their own agenda.\nLots to discuss with lawmakers\nCohen has pleaded guilty to a number of crimes, including arranging payments to two women ahead of Election Day in 2016 to buy their silence about alleged sexual relationships with Trump from years before.\nTrump has acknowledged a payment to one woman but denies the underlying allegations by both women about sexual relationships.\nThe president also argues that the actions Cohen admitted in his plea deal, which implicated Trump, weren't against the law \u2014 that he, in effect, pleaded guilty to crimes that aren't crimes. The judge in his case, however, supervised the plea and sentenced Cohen to three years in prison.\nCohen was scheduled to report to prison early next month but sought an extension, citing his recovery from shoulder surgery and the need to prepare for this week's extended visit to Capitol Hill.\nCohen also has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the negotiations he conducted on behalf of Trump's business with powerful Russians as part of a potential Trump Tower real estate project in Moscow.\nCohen first told lawmakers those talks wound up in early 2016, when actually they continued well into the campaign \u2014 almost to the point at which Trump became the Republican nominee for president.\nThat meant Trump's business was continuing to negotiate with Russians even as the Russian government had launched its campaign of \"active measures\" against the presidential election \u2014 and even as Trump was denying, in 2016, that he had any dealings with Russia.\nThe president has since said that he decided on his own not to go forward with Trump Tower Moscow and that his denials were appropriate because there was no final deal. The building was never built.\nA likely minefield\nThe challenge for Cummings and the other members of the oversight committee may be in navigating which subject matters fall on which side of the line they have drawn with Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller.\nCohen, meanwhile, may offer implicit clues about which areas are connected with alleged collusion in the questions that he agrees to answer and those to which he demurs.\nThe degree to which he addresses Trump Tower Moscow, for example, could offer suggestions about how closely it may be connected with the focus of Mueller's investigators.\nAnd Republicans on the oversight committee \u2014 many of whom are hostile toward Mueller, the Justice Department and Cohen \u2014 may not necessarily feel bound by any ground rules.\nRanking member Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has vowed that Republicans will ask what they want to ask.\n\"I have serious process concerns with this hearing,\" Jordan said. \"I will not stand by quietly while an admitted liar comes before the committee. Our members intend to question Mr. Cohen about the crimes he pleaded guilty to, other criminal activity he participated in but refused to disclose, his international financial dealings, and a long list of other probative activities.\"\nThe intricate procedural ground on which this battle is to be fought may make the Wednesday session another master class in congressional procedure. Republicans may attempt to use points of order, objections or other roadblocks to try to adjourn or constrain the proceedings.\nDemocrats can use their majority to keep the show going, but if they must take recorded votes or other procedural steps each time there is an objection, that could mean the Cohen hearing lasts for hours.\nDemocrats tried to use their own objections, points of order and other procedural obstacles when Republicans controlled the majority in the House, including at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee with former FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok.\nNow the shoe is on the other foot.\nA witness \u2014 but for whom?\nCohen is a politically problematic witness for both Democrats and Republicans.\nHis admissions about lying mean there is often scope for one side or the other to discount something he has said. Even prosecutors involved in his plea agreement in New York City complained they believed Cohen had more knowledge about wrongdoing than he admitted.\nExhibit A could be the role described for him in the infamous, partly unverified Russia dossier that appeared in early 2017, earlier in the Russia imbroglio.\nNPR has never detailed the document because so much of it remains unproved, but, in general terms, it describes travel by Cohen as part of an alleged conspiracy between Trump's inner circle and the Russian attack on the 2016 election.\nCohen told Congress on an earlier visit, when he was still loyal to Trump, that he denied that account. He also has said publicly several times since then that he didn't take part in the travel described in the dossier.\nCohen's denial helps Republicans who are eager to dismiss the dossier as baseless rumormongering and to undercut the basic premise of the Russia investigation being conducted by Mueller \u2014 that people like Cohen, working for Trump, may have colluded with the Russians.\nBut the degree to which Jordan or other Republican members attempt to reinforce those denials by Cohen complicates attempts to paint him as a liar in other ways \u2014 although that may not stop individual members from pursuing their own lines of questioning.\nThe inverse is true for Democrats and opponents of Trump: Cohen's denials about his travel were met with deep skepticism among people who believe the evidence is already clear about alleged collusion.\nNPR asked Cummings on Monday whether he expected Cohen would be a credible witness.\n\"We don't know,\" he said.\nBut the public clearly has an interest in getting his testimony on the record in the open, Cummings said.\n\"I practiced law for more than 20 years and you have a situation where a man, apparently, wants to bare his soul and talk about his relationship with this president,\" he told NPR's All Things Considered.\n\"But keep in mind, Michael Cohen is the one person who has accused the president of committing a crime. It's hard to say what's going to happen. But the good thing about it is that members of Congress will have an opportunity to observe him. The public will have an opportunity to observe him. And I think that's a good thing.\"",

Delegates voted to maintain current rules against LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriage.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Updated at 9:03 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>Leaders of the United Methodist Church have rejected the One Church Plan, a measure that would have eased restrictions on LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriages, with delegates voting against it at a special session of the church's General Conference.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday afternoon, delegates from around the world voted 438 to 384 to pass what was called the Traditional Plan, which maintains the church's rules.</p>\n<p>Earlier, delegates also had defeated the One Church Plan, which would have allowed individual churches to decide how they handle issues of same-sex weddings and the sexuality of their clergy.</p>\n<p>The Traditional Plan prevailed, despite impassioned warnings from delegates such as the Rev. Tom Berlin of Virginia &mdash; who compared it to a virus that would cause a dire sickness in America's Methodist community.</p>\n<p>The standoff over hotly contested aspects of church doctrine played out in St. Louis, where delegates were meeting for this week's special session of the General Conference. There, clergy and lay members of the church weighed how to respond to a 2018 report from a special church commission on revising the Methodists' guiding Book of Discipline.</p>\n<p>When it formed the commission, the Council of Bishops said it had heard many criticisms that the Book of Discipline &quot;contains language which is contradictory, unnecessarily hurtful, and inadequate for the variety of local, regional and global contexts.&quot;</p>\n<p>The report focused on sexuality and ways to strengthen the unity of a religious body that's home to a wide variety of views. And as the conference has shown, there is a wide diversity of deeply held opinions about those views. The bishops had recommended endorsing the One Church Plan.</p>\n<p>The conference was also taking place at a time when, as St. Louis Public Radio's Shahla Farzan <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/23/697122604/united-methodist-church-to-debate-lgbtq-clergy-and-same-sex-weddings\">has reported</a>, an increasing number of Methodist clergy have come out as gay. Amid the discord over the rival plans, supporters of change are left considering whether to remain in the church &mdash; and what the result says about their institution.</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Warren, a young gay delegate from the Upper New York Conference, told fellow conference attendees on Monday that he evangelizes on his college campus &mdash; and that he has success in reaching people for an important reason.</p>\n<p>&quot;They said they have not heard this message before,&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hey_savvy/status/1100163679952224258\">Warren said</a>. &quot;They didn't know God could love them, because their churches said God didn't.&quot;</p>\n<p>Trying to marshal support for the One Church initiative on Tuesday, Berlin of Virginia called it the &quot;only shot at change&quot; for people who want to lift blanket bans on same-sex couples who want to wed and on LGBTQ members of the church who want to be ordained.</p>\n<p>&quot;I doubt you're going to get a better offer today,&quot; Berlin said in his minority report speech, addressing delegates who might have withheld their vote because they felt the plan didn't go far enough.</p>\n<p>&quot;To those who would like to maintain the current Book of Discipline, you can still have it that way,&quot; Berlin said, adding that pastors would not be forced to perform same-sex weddings and churches wouldn't have to change their practices.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Berlin warned, there would be dire consequences if the Traditional Plan were to be embraced &mdash; particularly for Methodist churches in the U.S., where they represent the country's <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/chapter-1-the-changing-religious-composition-of-the-u-s/pr_15-05-12_rls_chapter1-03/\">second-largest Protestant denomination</a>.</p>\n<p>&quot;You will be putting a virus into the American church that will make it very sick, and it will be sick quickly,&quot; Berlin said, adding that however it's intended, the Traditional Plan will be perceived as an overt act against gay church members and others.</p>\n<p>&quot;Many of us have members who will leave,&quot; he said, adding that he had already gotten texts and other messages to that effect in the aftermath of Monday's initial vote.</p>\n<p>&quot;Many pastors are going to lead their church away from the connection. Some conferences will leave, I believe,&quot; Berlin said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Other people will stay and fight. And they will do weddings; they will break the Book of Discipline; there will be trials; it will be in the news,&quot; he said, adding that the focus will shift away from any good the church accomplishes.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's going to be about the people we don't serve,&quot; Berlin said, &quot;and the disagreement that will continue.&quot;</p>\n<p>Berlin, who is the lead pastor of Floris United Methodist Church in Herndon, Va., added that a &quot;virus of conflict&quot; would then cross from the U.S. into churches in other countries.</p>\n<p>Berlin urged anyone who is against the minority report to abstain from voting or to reject the Traditional Plan so the church would maintain its current status quo.</p>\n<p>&quot;I'm asking you to wash your hands of this Traditional Plan today,&quot; Berlin said as his supporters applauded, &quot;because it will bring that illness into our house.&quot;</p>\n<p>That triggered a number of speeches for and against the idea.</p>\n<p>In opposition, Cara Nicklas of Oklahoma faulted the way the impassioned debate has played out over the church's competing plans.</p>\n<p>&quot;By those advocating for the One Church Plan, I was either told explicitly that I am mean-spirited and unloving for holding to the church's doctrine on same-sex relationships, or the general tenor of the communications implied that I am unloving if I don't agree to change the church's Discipline. I don't love all, I am told.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;When that is the message &mdash; when gay persons become convinced I don't love them because I don't condone their behavior, it hurts my relationships with them,&quot; Nicklas said.</p>\n<p>The way the plan has been discussed is harmful, she said.</p>\n<p>&quot;You surely don't want to be united with me, if I am as mean and unloving as I am accused,&quot; Nicklas said. &quot;If the One Church Plan passes, I'm certain you will not stop trying to make me fit your idea of a loving person.&quot;</p>\n<p>Nicklas called it &quot;a false narrative&quot; that the One Church Plan would end the crisis or allow free choice.</p>\n<p>Also speaking against the plan was Nancy Denardo, a lay delegate of western Pennsylvania, who cited the Bible's mention of marriage as being between a man and woman in the Book of Matthew.</p>\n<p>&quot;The One Church Plan does not agree with the words of our savior,&quot; Denardo said, warning that it &quot;deceives young persons into believing that same-gender marriage is OK with God &mdash; when clearly it is not.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;The word became flesh &mdash; not the flesh becomes the word,&quot; Denardo said. She added, &quot;I'm truly sorry if the truth of the Gospel hurts anyone.&quot;</p>\n<p>After those speeches, Rey Hernandez of the Philippines East delegation rose to speak in favor of the alternative plan, saying it embraces the diversity of today's church and would help spread the Gospel.</p>\n<p>&quot;The One Church Plan ... reflects reality, the reality that we're trying to reach,&quot; Hernandez said.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the Rev. Byron Thomas of the North Georgia conference compared the dilemma to the church's earlier handling of race.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&quot;In 1939, the UMC was trying to figure out what to do with black people.

                "text": "Updated at 9:03 p.m. ET\nLeaders of the United Methodist Church have rejected the One Church Plan, a measure that would have eased restrictions on LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriages, with delegates voting against it at a special session of the church's General Conference.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, delegates from around the world voted 438 to 384 to pass what was called the Traditional Plan, which maintains the church's rules.\nEarlier, delegates also had defeated the One Church Plan, which would have allowed individual churches to decide how they handle issues of same-sex weddings and the sexuality of their clergy.\nThe Traditional Plan prevailed, despite impassioned warnings from delegates such as the Rev. Tom Berlin of Virginia \u2014 who compared it to a virus that would cause a dire sickness in America's Methodist community.\nThe standoff over hotly contested aspects of church doctrine played out in St. Louis, where delegates were meeting for this week's special session of the General Conference. There, clergy and lay members of the church weighed how to respond to a 2018 report from a special church commission on revising the Methodists' guiding Book of Discipline.\nWhen it formed the commission, the Council of Bishops said it had heard many criticisms that the Book of Discipline \"contains language which is contradictory, unnecessarily hurtful, and inadequate for the variety of local, regional and global contexts.\"\nThe report focused on sexuality and ways to strengthen the unity of a religious body that's home to a wide variety of views. And as the conference has shown, there is a wide diversity of deeply held opinions about those views. The bishops had recommended endorsing the One Church Plan.\nThe conference was also taking place at a time when, as St. Louis Public Radio's Shahla Farzan has reported, an increasing number of Methodist clergy have come out as gay. Amid the discord over the rival plans, supporters of change are left considering whether to remain in the church \u2014 and what the result says about their institution.\nJeffrey Warren, a young gay delegate from the Upper New York Conference, told fellow conference attendees on Monday that he evangelizes on his college campus \u2014 and that he has success in reaching people for an important reason.\n\"They said they have not heard this message before,\" Warren said. \"They didn't know God could love them, because their churches said God didn't.\"\nTrying to marshal support for the One Church initiative on Tuesday, Berlin of Virginia called it the \"only shot at change\" for people who want to lift blanket bans on same-sex couples who want to wed and on LGBTQ members of the church who want to be ordained.\n\"I doubt you're going to get a better offer today,\" Berlin said in his minority report speech, addressing delegates who might have withheld their vote because they felt the plan didn't go far enough.\n\"To those who would like to maintain the current Book of Discipline, you can still have it that way,\" Berlin said, adding that pastors would not be forced to perform same-sex weddings and churches wouldn't have to change their practices.\nOn the other hand, Berlin warned, there would be dire consequences if the Traditional Plan were to be embraced \u2014 particularly for Methodist churches in the U.S., where they represent the country's second-largest Protestant denomination.\n\"You will be putting a virus into the American church that will make it very sick, and it will be sick quickly,\" Berlin said, adding that however it's intended, the Traditional Plan will be perceived as an overt act against gay church members and others.\n\"Many of us have members who will leave,\" he said, adding that he had already gotten texts and other messages to that effect in the aftermath of Monday's initial vote.\n\"Many pastors are going to lead their church away from the connection. Some conferences will leave, I believe,\" Berlin said.\n\"Other people will stay and fight. And they will do weddings; they will break the Book of Discipline; there will be trials; it will be in the news,\" he said, adding that the focus will shift away from any good the church accomplishes.\n\"It's going to be about the people we don't serve,\" Berlin said, \"and the disagreement that will continue.\"\nBerlin, who is the lead pastor of Floris United Methodist Church in Herndon, Va., added that a \"virus of conflict\" would then cross from the U.S. into churches in other countries.\nBerlin urged anyone who is against the minority report to abstain from voting or to reject the Traditional Plan so the church would maintain its current status quo.\n\"I'm asking you to wash your hands of this Traditional Plan today,\" Berlin said as his supporters applauded, \"because it will bring that illness into our house.\"\nThat triggered a number of speeches for and against the idea.\nIn opposition, Cara Nicklas of Oklahoma faulted the way the impassioned debate has played out over the church's competing plans.\n\"By those advocating for the One Church Plan, I was either told explicitly that I am mean-spirited and unloving for holding to the church's doctrine on same-sex relationships, or the general tenor of the communications implied that I am unloving if I don't agree to change the church's Discipline. I don't love all, I am told.\"\n\"When that is the message \u2014 when gay persons become convinced I don't love them because I don't condone their behavior, it hurts my relationships with them,\" Nicklas said.\nThe way the plan has been discussed is harmful, she said.\n\"You surely don't want to be united with me, if I am as mean and unloving as I am accused,\" Nicklas said. \"If the One Church Plan passes, I'm certain you will not stop trying to make me fit your idea of a loving person.\"\nNicklas called it \"a false narrative\" that the One Church Plan would end the crisis or allow free choice.\nAlso speaking against the plan was Nancy Denardo, a lay delegate of western Pennsylvania, who cited the Bible's mention of marriage as being between a man and woman in the Book of Matthew.\n\"The One Church Plan does not agree with the words of our savior,\" Denardo said, warning that it \"deceives young persons into believing that same-gender marriage is OK with God \u2014 when clearly it is not.\"\n\"The word became flesh \u2014 not the flesh becomes the word,\" Denardo said. She added, \"I'm truly sorry if the truth of the Gospel hurts anyone.\"\nAfter those speeches, Rey Hernandez of the Philippines East delegation rose to speak in favor of the alternative plan, saying it embraces the diversity of today's church and would help spread the Gospel.\n\"The One Church Plan ... reflects reality, the reality that we're trying to reach,\" Hernandez said.\nOn Monday, the Rev. Byron Thomas of the North Georgia conference compared the dilemma to the church's earlier handling of race.\n\"In 1939, the UMC was trying to figure out what to do with black people. At that GC, the Central Jurisdiction was voted into being. The late Bishop Thomas wrote that the white folks stood up and clapped, and the black folks sat down and cried,\" Rev. Bryon Thomas of North Georgia\n\u2014 Iowa Conference of The United Methodist Church (@IowaUMChurch) February 25, 2019\n\"In 1939, the UMC was trying to figure out what to do with black people,\" Thomas said, as quoted by the Iowa conference. \"At that GC, the Central Jurisdiction was voted into being. The late Bishop Thomas wrote that the white folks stood up and clapped, and the black folks sat down and cried.\"\n\"I believe we are at another stand up and clap, sit down and cry moment,\" Thomas was quoted as saying Monday.",

It is a privileged measure, which means it is not subject to a filibuster, needs only a simply majority and is required to come to the floor for a vote within weeks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters on Tuesday that he expects the Senate will vote on it before March 18.</p>\n<p>So far only three Senate Republicans &mdash; Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina &mdash; say they will vote with Democrats in opposition to the president's actions.</p>\n<p>The Republican-led Senate is split 53-47, which means Democrats need one more vote in addition to Collins, Murkowski and Tillis for the measure to pass. McConnell declined to handicap the vote, but other members of Senate leadership including Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said they expect it to pass the Senate.</p>\n<p>Vice President Pence and a Justice Department lawyer huddled privately with Senate Republicans for their weekly Tuesday meeting that was dominated by debate over the president's legal authority to use his emergency powers as he has to find funding for a border wall.</p>\n<p>McConnell characterized it as a &quot;robust, vigorous&quot; discussion and said he had not &quot;reached a total conclusion&quot; over the legality of the president's actions. However, McConnell has already publicly committed to voting against the resolution in support of the president's position.</p>\n<p>The White House asserts that the president has the legal authority to declare a national emergency and to redirect existing federal funds to address that emergency. Congress did approve $1.375 billion for new physical barriers along the border <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/14/694647564/congress-sprints-to-pass-border-security-package-with-trumps-support-unclear\">in a spending bill approved earlier this month</a>, but it was less than the White House requested. Soon after, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/15/695012728/trump-expected-to-declare-national-emergency-to-help-fund-southern-border-wall\">the president declared a national emergency</a> to redirect more than $6 billion to build additional barrier.</p>\n<p>If the resolution reaches his desk, it will be the first veto of Trump's presidency. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters that Congress will not be able to block Trump's emergency declaration. &quot;When you see the vote today there will be nowhere near the votes to override a veto,&quot; he said, &quot;Ultimately we are gonna stand with the president in making sure we can secure this border and confront this national crisis that's taking lives every single day.&quot;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/18/695821740/16-states-sue-over-trumps-national-emergency-declaration\">A coalition of 16 states has filed suit</a> against the Trump administration to try to block his emergency declaration. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have also said they will challenge the national emergency declaration in court, setting up a potential constitutional test over the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches of government.</p>",

                "text": "The Democratic-led House approved by a 245-182 vote a resolution on Tuesday that would terminate President Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 a declaration he made to allow him to access funds to build a wall without congressional consent.\nOnly 13 Republicans joined Democrats to oppose the president, signaling that Congress will not ultimately have the veto-proof margin required to override Trump.\nThe resolution now heads to the Senate. It is a privileged measure, which means it is not subject to a filibuster, needs only a simply majority and is required to come to the floor for a vote within weeks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters on Tuesday that he expects the Senate will vote on it before March 18.\nSo far only three Senate Republicans \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina \u2014 say they will vote with Democrats in opposition to the president's actions.\nThe Republican-led Senate is split 53-47, which means Democrats need one more vote in addition to Collins, Murkowski and Tillis for the measure to pass. McConnell declined to handicap the vote, but other members of Senate leadership including Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said they expect it to pass the Senate.\nVice President Pence and a Justice Department lawyer huddled privately with Senate Republicans for their weekly Tuesday meeting that was dominated by debate over the president's legal authority to use his emergency powers as he has to find funding for a border wall.\nMcConnell characterized it as a \"robust, vigorous\" discussion and said he had not \"reached a total conclusion\" over the legality of the president's actions. However, McConnell has already publicly committed to voting against the resolution in support of the president's position.\nThe White House asserts that the president has the legal authority to declare a national emergency and to redirect existing federal funds to address that emergency. Congress did approve $1.375 billion for new physical barriers along the border in a spending bill approved earlier this month, but it was less than the White House requested. Soon after, the president declared a national emergency to redirect more than $6 billion to build additional barrier.\nIf the resolution reaches his desk, it will be the first veto of Trump's presidency. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters that Congress will not be able to block Trump's emergency declaration. \"When you see the vote today there will be nowhere near the votes to override a veto,\" he said, \"Ultimately we are gonna stand with the president in making sure we can secure this border and confront this national crisis that's taking lives every single day.\"\nA coalition of 16 states has filed suit against the Trump administration to try to block his emergency declaration. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have also said they will challenge the national emergency declaration in court, setting up a potential constitutional test over the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches of government.",

It, like the Obama administration, had argued that the government has the authority to pick up and detain immigrants for deportation at any time, and is not required to act only immediately after a prison or jail sentence has been served.</p>\n<p>Writing for the conservative majority, Justice Samuel Alito, said immigration law mandates the detention of &quot;deportable criminal aliens&quot; even if it is years later.</p>\n<p>Alito wrote that it is &quot;especially hard to swallow&quot; the notion that &quot;the alien must be arrested on the day he walks out of jail.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;As we have held time and again, an official's duties are better carried out late than never,&quot; he wrote.</p>\n<p>Writing for the court's dissenting liberal wing, Justice Stephen Breyer warned that the ruling gives the government too much power. The law is clear, he wrote, that the government cannot hold an immigrant without a bail hearing unless the individual is detained when released from criminal custody.</p>\n<p>To underscore his dissent, Breyer read aloud part of his opinion.</p>\n<p>&quot;In deciphering the intent of the Congress that wrote this statute, we must decide &mdash; in the face of what is, at worst, linguistic ambiguity &mdash; whether Congress intended that persons who have long since paid their debt to society would be deprived of their liberty for months or years without the possibility of bail,&quot; Breyer wrote.</p>\n<p>&quot;We cannot decide that question without bearing in mind basic American legal values: the Government's duty not to deprive any 'person' of 'liberty' without 'due process of law,' &quot; he added.</p>\n<p>The high court's ruling comes in response to two unrelated class-action cases.</p>\n<p>In one case, Mony Preap, a <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/16-1363\">legal permanent resident</a> from Cambodia was arrested and convicted of marijuana possession in 2006. But he wasn't detained by federal authorities until 2013 following another sentence for battery &mdash; a non-deportable offense. Preap remains in the U.S. after successfully challenging his deportation case.</p>\n<p>In the companion case before the court, Bassam Yusuf Khoury, described in court papers as &quot;a native of Palestine,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/khoury-v-asher-complaint\">served a 30-day sentence</a> on a drug charge in 2011. Two years later, federal authorities detained and tried to deport him. He was held for six months before a judge ordered his release. Khoury also won his deportation case and still resides in the U.S.</p>\n<p>The American Civil Liberties Union represented both plaintiffs. The ACLU's Deputy Legal Director Cecilia Wang said Tuesday's ruling follows another <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/02/27/589096901/supreme-court-ruling-means-immigrants-can-continue-to-be-detained-indefinitely\">decision last year</a> that limited the rights of immigrants to bond hearings.</p>\n<p>&quot;For two years in a row now, the Supreme Court has endorsed the most extreme interpretation of immigration detention statutes, allowing mass incarceration of people without any hearing, simply because they are defending themselves against a deportation charge,&quot; said Wang in a <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-comment-supreme-court-immigration-detention-ruling-0\">statement</a>. &quot;We will continue to fight the gross overuse of detention in the immigration system.&quot;</p>",

It, like the Obama administration, had argued that the government has the authority to pick up and detain immigrants for deportation at any time, and is not required to act only immediately after a prison or jail sentence has been served.\nWriting for the conservative majority, Justice Samuel Alito, said immigration law mandates the detention of \"deportable criminal aliens\" even if it is years later.\nAlito wrote that it is \"especially hard to swallow\" the notion that \"the alien must be arrested on the day he walks out of jail.\"\n\"As we have held time and again, an official's duties are better carried out late than never,\" he wrote.\nWriting for the court's dissenting liberal wing, Justice Stephen Breyer warned that the ruling gives the government too much power. The law is clear, he wrote, that the government cannot hold an immigrant without a bail hearing unless the individual is detained when released from criminal custody.\nTo underscore his dissent, Breyer read aloud part of his opinion.\n\"In deciphering the intent of the Congress that wrote this statute, we must decide \u2014 in the face of what is, at worst, linguistic ambiguity \u2014 whether Congress intended that persons who have long since paid their debt to society would be deprived of their liberty for months or years without the possibility of bail,\" Breyer wrote.\n\"We cannot decide that question without bearing in mind basic American legal values: the Government's duty not to deprive any 'person' of 'liberty' without 'due process of law,' \" he added.\nThe high court's ruling comes in response to two unrelated class-action cases.\nIn one case, Mony Preap, a legal permanent resident from Cambodia was arrested and convicted of marijuana possession in 2006. But he wasn't detained by federal authorities until 2013 following another sentence for battery \u2014 a non-deportable offense. Preap remains in the U.S. after successfully challenging his deportation case.\nIn the companion case before the court, Bassam Yusuf Khoury, described in court papers as \"a native of Palestine,\" served a 30-day sentence on a drug charge in 2011. Two years later, federal authorities detained and tried to deport him. He was held for six months before a judge ordered his release. Khoury also won his deportation case and still resides in the U.S.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union represented both plaintiffs. The ACLU's Deputy Legal Director Cecilia Wang said Tuesday's ruling follows another decision last year that limited the rights of immigrants to bond hearings.\n\"For two years in a row now, the Supreme Court has endorsed the most extreme interpretation of immigration detention statutes, allowing mass incarceration of people without any hearing, simply because they are defending themselves against a deportation charge,\" said Wang in a statement. \"We will continue to fight the gross overuse of detention in the immigration system.\"",
