Among them is Scottie Nell Hughes.</p>\n<p>She said she was 'heartbroken' to learn of a recording which proved Michael Sanchez had discussed details of her case against Fox News in 2017 with the publication.</p>\n<p>Hughes sued the network alleging she was raped by Charles Payne.</p>\n<p>In his interview with The Post, Michael Sanchez failed to mention that he and his sister had not spoken for weeks.</p>\n<p>'I have been managing my sister since the day she came home from the hospital, for 49 years.</p>\n<p>'That&rsquo;s a message I want to be out there. Even when she and I have had fights when we were kids, in college, or whenever, if anyone says a word against her, I defend her and protect her to the end. That&rsquo;s the essence of my relationship with my sister,' he said.</p>\n<p>It seems however that it was Lauren Sanchez who was the protector in recent years, loaning her brother at least $165,000 when he field for bankruptcy in 2010 and giving him a job as her manager and publicist.</p>\n<p>Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are yet to be seen in public as an official couple after the National Enquirer published a story in January about their affair and message exchange, hot off the back of Bezos' announcement on January 9, that he and wife MacKenzie were separating after 26 years of marriage.</p>\n<p>Private investigators working for Bezos concluded that Michael Sanchez, who is a supporter of President Trump, leaked intimate text messages from the couple to one another to the National Enquirer.</p>\n<p>In a interview with <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/suspected-bezos-leaker-supplies-his-own-theory-about-the-affair\">Vanity Fair</a>, Michael Sanchez denied any involvement in the leak of 'below-the-belt selfies.'</p>\n<p>'I had nothing to do with leak of the d**k pics. That's the important thing,' Sanchez said, adding it's 'likely' Lauren shared them.</p>\n<p>Michael Sanchez played coy in that interview at one point saying: 'I'm not saying I didn't do something. Until I go under oath, what I can tell you now is that ever since April 20, when I met Jeff, my only goal has been to protect Jeff and Lauren.'</p>\n<p>On February 7, Bezos penned a post on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\">Medium</a> including what he said were emails from Dylan Howard, the chief content officer of American Media (AMI), publisher of the National Enquirer, in which he threatens to release explicit photos and content relating to Bezos' relationship with Sanchez.</p>\n<p>Chairman of AMI, David Pecker has denied the tabloid committed extortion or blackmail by threatening to publish the Amazon CEO's explicit photos.</p>\n<p>In its initial story, the Enquirer said reporters followed Bezos and Sanchez 'across five states and 40,000 miles' and 'tailed them in private jets, swanky limos, helicopter rides, romantic hikes, five-star hotel hideaways, intimate dinner dates and 'quality time' in hidden love nests.'</p>",

                "text": "Michael Sanchez, the brother of Jeff Bezos\u2019 mistress, admitted that he struck a \u2018deal with the devil\u2019 and received $200,000 from the National Enquirer in exchange for helping the tabloid break the story of the Amazon CEO\u2019s extramarital affair.\nSanchez said he did it to protect his sister, Lauren Sanchez, and her new flame, Bezos, because he wanted the news of their romance to become public after both of their spouses were told, according to Page Six.\nIt doesn\u2019t appear as if Lauren Sanchez felt her brother\u2019s intentions were good, as she cut ties with the man who is not only her sibling but was also a manager and publicist.\nThough Michael Sanchez admits to revealing the affair and leaking text messages to the Enquirer, he adamantly denies obtaining intimate photos, including 'selfies' of Bezos' genitalia.\n'I may have helped the Enquirer with their story,' he told Page Six.\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos is seen left with Lauren Sanchez in Los Angeles in December 2016. Michael Sanchez is seen in the photo on the right\n'But I never had access to the penis selfies.'\nIt was those 'penis selfies' that Bezos says the Enquirer's parent company, American Media, Inc., was using to extort him.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that AMI paid Michael Sanchez $200,000 to obtain intimate texts between the Amazon CEO and his sister.\nThe Journal's finding, attributed to people familiar with the matter, parallels the conclusion reached by private investigators working for Bezos as of early February.\nThose investigators reportedly found that Michael Sanchez had leaked the texts to the Enquirer, although they didn't appear to conclude who might have paid for them.\nBezos has said AMI threatened to publish explicit photos of him unless he stopped investigating how the Enquirer obtained his private exchanges and publicly declared that the Enquirer's coverage of him was not politically motivated.\nLast month, Bezos and Sanchez are reported to have enjoyed a secret reunion in one of Bezos' multi-million dollar Manhattan properties around Valentine's Day.\nBut Page Six reported on Tuesday that sources close to Bezos strongly deny that there was a date.\nIn fact, the two have not met up since the story of their relationship became public, according to a source.\n'A lot of this has to do with their decision to lay low and spend time with their kids, who didn\u2019t get a warning about the Enquirer story and now have to deal with the intense public interest and the paparazzi in pursuit,' a source told Page Six.\nThe source laid part of the blame on Michael Sanchez.\n'Michael isn\u2019t doing her and Jeff any favors by keeping his sister\u2019s name in the press,' the source said.\n'He may genuinely believe he is defending Lauren, but in many ways he is actually doing more to...doom her relationship with Jeff.'\nThe relationship between the siblings appears to be ruptured.\nIn the weeks following the National Enquirer's expose, Michael Sanchez contacted The Washington Post, the newspaper Bezos owns, to act as an 'off the record point of contact' for information about his sister.\n'For obvious reasons, I can\u2019t go into detail on email and all of my communications must be completely Confidential.\n'I\u2019m reaching out to you, off-the-record. I will be your single point-of-contact for anything Lauren-related. I\u2019d appreciate it if we can keep open (one) line of communication,' he said in an email in January, 'days after' the Enquirer published its explosive piece.\nAs the weeks went by, details emerged that he was one of the people being questioned by Bezos' private security lead, Gavin De Becker, to identify the source of the leak.\nDe Becker has not named him explicitly as the source but he is the only person he has named as a subject of his investigation.\nMultiple sources at AMI told The Daily Beast that it was Michael Sanchez who gave them the story and they have also claimed he acted as a leak for other clients.\nIn January, Bezos announced he was divorcing his wife of more than 26 years, MacKenzie Bezos (seen left with Jeff Bezos), just days before the Enquirer broke the story about his affair with Sanchez (right)\nOn Tuesday night, The Washington Post published its communication with Michael Sanchez and revealed the fact that he and Lauren were no longer speaking.\nIt also published, for the first time, details of his 2010 bankruptcy filing and the fact that Lauren, a former TV host turned pilot, had loaned him $165,000.\nAfter the story went live, Michael Sanchez hit out angrily at its tone and said in an email to The Post: 'It\u2019s pretty simple: Jeff Bezos had an extramarital affair, lied about it in his tone-deaf \"divorce\" tweet and has engaged in a scorched-earth campaign to cover up responsibility for the demise of two families and the failure to protect the privacy and technology of the man practically owns the cloud, culminating in a Washington Post hit piece written by Sarah Ellison, the writer I handpicked to tell the whole truth.'\nAccording to the Post, Michael Sanchez has sold other clients' stories in the past. Among them is Scottie Nell Hughes.\nShe said she was 'heartbroken' to learn of a recording which proved Michael Sanchez had discussed details of her case against Fox News in 2017 with the publication.\nHughes sued the network alleging she was raped by Charles Payne.\nIn his interview with The Post, Michael Sanchez failed to mention that he and his sister had not spoken for weeks.\n'I have been managing my sister since the day she came home from the hospital, for 49 years.\n'That\u2019s a message I want to be out there. Even when she and I have had fights when we were kids, in college, or whenever, if anyone says a word against her, I defend her and protect her to the end. That\u2019s the essence of my relationship with my sister,' he said.\nIt seems however that it was Lauren Sanchez who was the protector in recent years, loaning her brother at least $165,000 when he field for bankruptcy in 2010 and giving him a job as her manager and publicist.\nBezos and Lauren Sanchez are yet to be seen in public as an official couple after the National Enquirer published a story in January about their affair and message exchange, hot off the back of Bezos' announcement on January 9, that he and wife MacKenzie were separating after 26 years of marriage.\nPrivate investigators working for Bezos concluded that Michael Sanchez, who is a supporter of President Trump, leaked intimate text messages from the couple to one another to the National Enquirer.\nIn a interview with Vanity Fair, Michael Sanchez denied any involvement in the leak of 'below-the-belt selfies.'\n'I had nothing to do with leak of the d**k pics. That's the important thing,' Sanchez said, adding it's 'likely' Lauren shared them.\nMichael Sanchez played coy in that interview at one point saying: 'I'm not saying I didn't do something. Until I go under oath, what I can tell you now is that ever since April 20, when I met Jeff, my only goal has been to protect Jeff and Lauren.'\nOn February 7, Bezos penned a post on Medium including what he said were emails from Dylan Howard, the chief content officer of American Media (AMI), publisher of the National Enquirer, in which he threatens to release explicit photos and content relating to Bezos' relationship with Sanchez.\nChairman of AMI, David Pecker has denied the tabloid committed extortion or blackmail by threatening to publish the Amazon CEO's explicit photos.\nIn its initial story, the Enquirer said reporters followed Bezos and Sanchez 'across five states and 40,000 miles' and 'tailed them in private jets, swanky limos, helicopter rides, romantic hikes, five-star hotel hideaways, intimate dinner dates and 'quality time' in hidden love nests.'",

The Vermont Senator declared he'd be running for president for a second time in February.\nTrump has tipped 'Sleepy' Joe Biden (left) and 'Crazy' Bernie Sanders (right) to prevail in the Democratic 2020 election bid, but says he doesn't fear the competition\nDespite having been considered an under-dog in during his last bid three years ago, the 77-year-old now finds his name circled among the favorites.\nFormer Vice President Biden hasn't announced whether he will be appearing on the ballot just yet, but he's widely expected to enter the race.\n'I look forward to facing whoever it may be,' Trump continued.\nHe ended his tweet with a cryptic, 'May God Rest Their Soul!'\nTrump\u2019s prediction followed a tweet aimed at Sanders regarding his finances, which implied hypocrisy against the progressive lawmaker\u2019s hard-line views on taxing the country's richest one percent.\n\u2018Bernie Sanders and wife should pay the Pre-Trump Taxes on their almost $600,000 in income,\u2019 Trump wrote.\n\u2018He is always complaining about these big TAX CUTS, except when it benefits him. They made a fortune off of Trump, but so did everyone else - and that\u2019s a good thing, not a bad thing!\u2019\nIn the run up to Fox News\u2019 town hall on Monday night, Bernie Sander\u2019s campaign released a series of the presidential hopeful\u2019s tax returns.\nThe figures show that Sanders and his wife, Jane, paid a tax rate of 26 percent on $561,293 of income last year.\nThe pair also made over $1 million in 2016 and 2017. Nearly $400,000 of Sander\u2019s income came from book sales, credited in large to his 2018 New York Times best-seller, \u2018Where We Go from Here\u2019.\n\u2018Looks like President Trump is scared of our campaign,\u2019 Sanders indirectly declared on Twitter in response. \u2018He should be.'",

Migrants who present themselves at ports of entry and ask for asylum are not eligible for bond.</p>\n<p>But before Barr's ruling, those who had crossed the border between official entry points and asked for asylum were eligible for bond, once they had proven to asylum officers they had a credible fear of persecution.</p>\n<p>'I conclude that such aliens remain ineligible for bond, whether they are arriving at the border or are apprehended in the United States,' Barr wrote.</p>\n<p>Barr said such people can be held in immigration detention until their cases conclude, or if the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) decides to release them by granting them 'parole.' DHS has the discretion to parole people who are not eligible for bond and frequently does so due to insufficient detention space or other humanitarian reasons.</p>\n<p>Barr said he was delaying the effective date by 90 days 'so that DHS may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions.'</p>\n<p>The decision's full impact is not yet clear, because it will in large part depend on DHS' ability to expand detention, said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas.</p>\n<p>'The number of asylum seekers who will remain in potentially indefinite detention pending disposition of their cases will be almost entirely a question of DHS's detention capacity, and not whether the individual circumstances of individual cases warrant release or detention,' Vladeck said.</p>\n<p>DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision. The agency had written in a brief in the case arguing that eliminating bond hearings for the asylum seekers would have 'an immediate and significant impact on...detention operations.'</p>\n<figure><video data-opts=\"{\"linkBaseURL\":\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6930423/Trump-attorney-generals-ruling-expands-indefinite-detention-asylum-seekers.html#v-956804730993685008\",\"isMobile\":false,\"duration\":77000,\"src\":\"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/04/10/956804730993685008/1024x576_MP4_956804730993685008.mp4\",\"source\":\"Reuters\",\"playerId\":\"default\",\"title\":\"New wave of migrants seek asylum in the United States\",\"preload\":\"none\",\"initialVideo\":true,\"thumbnail\":\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/10/17/12106718-0-image-a-22_1554913628451.jpg\",\"poster\":\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/10/17/12106718-0-image-a-23_1554913629423.jpg\",\"syndicationService\":null,\"shortURL\":\"https://mol.im/a/6930423#v-956804730993685008\",\"plugins\":{\"social-share\":{\"embedUrl\":\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/embed/video/1902814.html\"},\"autoplay-next-video\":{\"videos\":\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/api/player/1902814/related-videos.json\",\"countdown_time\":10},\"ads-setup\":{\"videoAdServerUrl\":\"https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=[size]&iu=%2F424397508%2Fdm.video%2Fdm_video_news&ciu_szs=&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=xml_vast3&unviewed_position_start=1&url=[referrer_url]&correlator=[timestamp]\",\"adsEnabled\":true,\"adsCancelTimeout\":15000,\"screen\":{\"width\":636,\"height\":358}},\"sources\":{\"url\":\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/api/player/956804730993685008/video-sources.json\"},\"flyout\":{\"viewportOffset\":0.4,\"switchBack\":true,\"forceFlyout\":{\"active\":true,\"muted\":true,\"switchBack\":false}},\"tracking\":{\"channelShortName\":\"news\",\"sponsored\":null,\"referenceId\":1902814,\"trackingType\":\"embedded\"},\"animated-preview\":{\"data-hd-fps\":7,\"displayName\":null,\"data-hd-frame-count\":68,\"frames\":145,\"width\":636,\"src\":\"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/preview/mol/2019/04/10/7385530868081377660/636x382_JPG-SINGLE_7385530868081377660.jpg\",\"fps\":0,\"data-film\":\"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/preview/mol/2019/04/10/7385530868081377660/308x174_JPG_7385530868081377660.jpg\",\"data-fps\":7,\"data-video\":\"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/preview/mol/2019/04/10/7385530868081377660/636x382_MP4_7385530868081377660.mp4\",\"data-hd-film\":\"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/preview/mol/2019/04/10/7385530868081377660/636x382_JPG-HD_7385530868081377660.jpg\",\"data-hd-frame-width\":636,\"data-frame-height\":172,\"data-frame-width\":308,\"data-frame-count\":68,\"height\":356,\"data-hd-frame-height\":356},\"related-videos\":{\"videos\":\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/api/player/1902814/related-videos.json\"}},\"videoId\":\"956804730993685008\",\"descr\":\"Waves of asylum seekers continue to enter the United States souther border after a string of recent caravans migrated through Central America.\",\"referenceId\":1902814,\"grapeshot\":{\"article\":{\"articleURL\":\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7298401/Bill-Barr-ends-guarantee-asylum-people-families-targeted-narco-gangs.html\"}}}\"> <figure><source src=\"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/04/10/956804730993685008/1024x576_MP4_956804730993685008.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source></figure> </video></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Barr's ruling is the latest instance of the Trump administration taking a hard line on immigration.

                "text": "The U.S. Attorney General on Tuesday struck down a decision that had allowed some asylum seekers to ask for bond in front of an immigration judge, in a ruling that expands indefinite detention for some migrants who must wait months or years for their cases to be heard.\nThe first immigration court ruling from President Donald Trump's newly appointed Attorney General William Barr is in keeping with the administration's moves to clamp down on the asylum process as tens of thousands of mostly Central Americans cross into the United States asking for refuge.\nU.S. immigration courts are overseen by the Justice Department and the Attorney General can rule in cases to set legal precedent.\nBarr's ruling is the latest instance of the Trump administration taking a hard line on immigration. This year the administration implemented a policy to return some asylum seekers to Mexico while their cases work their way through backlogged courts, a policy which has been challenged with a lawsuit.\nSeveral top officials at the Department of Homeland Security were forced out this month over Trump's frustrations with an influx of migrants seeking refuge at the U.S. southern border.\nBarr's decision applies to migrants who crossed illegally into the United States.\nTypically, those migrants are placed in 'expedited removal' proceedings - a faster form of deportation reserved for people who illegally entered the country within the last two weeks and are detained within 100 miles (160 km) of a land border. Migrants who present themselves at ports of entry and ask for asylum are not eligible for bond.\nBut before Barr's ruling, those who had crossed the border between official entry points and asked for asylum were eligible for bond, once they had proven to asylum officers they had a credible fear of persecution.\n'I conclude that such aliens remain ineligible for bond, whether they are arriving at the border or are apprehended in the United States,' Barr wrote.\nBarr said such people can be held in immigration detention until their cases conclude, or if the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) decides to release them by granting them 'parole.' DHS has the discretion to parole people who are not eligible for bond and frequently does so due to insufficient detention space or other humanitarian reasons.\nBarr said he was delaying the effective date by 90 days 'so that DHS may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions.'\nThe decision's full impact is not yet clear, because it will in large part depend on DHS' ability to expand detention, said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas.\n'The number of asylum seekers who will remain in potentially indefinite detention pending disposition of their cases will be almost entirely a question of DHS's detention capacity, and not whether the individual circumstances of individual cases warrant release or detention,' Vladeck said.\nDHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision. The agency had written in a brief in the case arguing that eliminating bond hearings for the asylum seekers would have 'an immediate and significant impact on...detention operations.'\nIn early March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the DHS agency responsible for detaining and deporting immigrants in the country illegally, said the average daily population of immigrants in detention topped 46,000 for the 2019 fiscal year, the highest level since the agency was created in 2003.\nLast year, Reuters reported that ICE had modified a tool officers have been using since 2013 when deciding whether an immigrant should be detained or released on bond, making the process more restrictive.\nThe decision will have no impact on unaccompanied migrant children, who are exempt from expedited removal. Most families are also paroled because of a lack of facilities to hold parents and children together.\nMichael Tan, from the American Civil Liberties Union, said the rights group intended to sue the Trump administration over the decision, and immigrant advocates decried the decision.\nBarr's decision came after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided to review the case in October. Sessions resigned from his position in November, leaving the case to Barr to decide.",

(Photo: Ingo D&ouml;renberg/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While most attention has been focused on immigrants trying to enter the United States over America&rsquo;s southern border, there is legal migration taking place that has been largely ignored, though it may have at least as much economic and political impact as the other.</p>\n<p>People are moving out of high-tax states to Florida and other states with lower tax burdens.</p>\n<p>Florida&rsquo;s new governor, Ron DeSantis, mentioned the movement in a speech to the Club for Growth, which describes itself as &ldquo;a national network of over 250,000 pro-growth, limited government Americans who share in the belief that prosperity and opportunity come from economic freedom.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>DeSantis says New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has accused him of stealing residents from his state. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not stealing anybody,&rdquo; said DeSantis, &ldquo;they are driving people away.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The data back him up. Chris Edwards of the Foundation for Economic Freedom, the first free-market organization in the United States, produced a research document for the Cato Institute that shows &ldquo;of the 25 highest-tax states, 24 of them had net out-migration in 2016.&rdquo; One of the states that gained from migration was Florida where &ldquo;145 households moved in for every 100 that left.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>DeSantis says this influx has fueled economic growth of the state, leading to a $1.4 billion revenue surplus.</p>\n<p>Economist Richard Rahn has created a chart that includes a comparison between the tax rates of New York and Florida. He writes that while New York imposes high taxes and conveys an anti-business attitude (the recent debacle with New York City losing a headquarters for Amazon is just the latest example), &ldquo;Florida imposes no state and local income taxes in addition to the federal income tax&mdash;yet Florida is booming, with a budget surplus, while New York is mired in debt. Only 50 years ago, New York had four times the population of Florida, and now Florida is larger than New York.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The sound economic state of Florida is not the only subject DeSantis is touting. He won applause from the dinner crowd when he mentioned his executive orders suspending Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher and Brenda Snipes, Broward County supervisor of elections. Republicans have accused these two of manipulating votes, causing confusion and chaos over vote counting that dates back to Bush-Gore in 2000.</p>\n<p>DeSantis has other victories in his short time in office. He has named three conservatives to the state Supreme Court, transforming it from a liberal to a solid conservative majority. He has also announced plans to sign an executive order scrapping the &ldquo;Common Core&rdquo; public school curriculum, replacing it with a &ldquo;strong American civics&rdquo; course.</p>\n<p>As a new Florida resident, what amazes me is why high-tax states don&rsquo;t get it? The facts are there for anyone to see, except for those who deliberately refuse to see them. And that&rsquo;s the problem.

                "text": "While most attention has been focused on immigrants trying to enter the United States over America\u2019s southern border, there is legal migration taking place that has been largely ignored, though it may have at least as much economic and political impact as the other.\nPeople are moving out of high-tax states to Florida and other states with lower tax burdens.\nFlorida\u2019s new governor, Ron DeSantis, mentioned the movement in a speech to the Club for Growth, which describes itself as \u201ca national network of over 250,000 pro-growth, limited government Americans who share in the belief that prosperity and opportunity come from economic freedom.\u201d\nDeSantis says New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has accused him of stealing residents from his state. \u201cI\u2019m not stealing anybody,\u201d said DeSantis, \u201cthey are driving people away.\u201d\nThe data back him up. Chris Edwards of the Foundation for Economic Freedom, the first free-market organization in the United States, produced a research document for the Cato Institute that shows \u201cof the 25 highest-tax states, 24 of them had net out-migration in 2016.\u201d One of the states that gained from migration was Florida where \u201c145 households moved in for every 100 that left.\u201d\nDeSantis says this influx has fueled economic growth of the state, leading to a $1.4 billion revenue surplus.\nEconomist Richard Rahn has created a chart that includes a comparison between the tax rates of New York and Florida. He writes that while New York imposes high taxes and conveys an anti-business attitude (the recent debacle with New York City losing a headquarters for Amazon is just the latest example), \u201cFlorida imposes no state and local income taxes in addition to the federal income tax\u2014yet Florida is booming, with a budget surplus, while New York is mired in debt. Only 50 years ago, New York had four times the population of Florida, and now Florida is larger than New York.\u201d\nThe sound economic state of Florida is not the only subject DeSantis is touting. He won applause from the dinner crowd when he mentioned his executive orders suspending Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher and Brenda Snipes, Broward County supervisor of elections. Republicans have accused these two of manipulating votes, causing confusion and chaos over vote counting that dates back to Bush-Gore in 2000.\nDeSantis has other victories in his short time in office. He has named three conservatives to the state Supreme Court, transforming it from a liberal to a solid conservative majority. He has also announced plans to sign an executive order scrapping the \u201cCommon Core\u201d public school curriculum, replacing it with a \u201cstrong American civics\u201d course.\nAs a new Florida resident, what amazes me is why high-tax states don\u2019t get it? The facts are there for anyone to see, except for those who deliberately refuse to see them. And that\u2019s the problem. In the case of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, and other Democrat-run states, ideology appears to have eclipsed reality.\nIf Cuomo thinks DeSantis is stealing residents from New York, maybe he should consider whether his policy of \u201cstealing\u201d taxpayer earnings and demanding that residents pay even more isn\u2019t the real reason for the exodus.\nIt is not a difficult question to answer. In addition to the economic benefits associated with living in Florida, the weather is a lot nicer, if you discount the occasional hurricane. While people were freezing up North during the recent polar vortex, the sunny temperatures in South Florida ranged from the 70s to the low 80s.\nSo, keep coming, New Yorkers, and others from high-tax states. Down here, the policy seems to be that if you can earn it, you get to keep more of it. That is the best prescription for economic growth and personal satisfaction.\n(c) 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

He serves as program chairperson for the Lincoln Club of Orange County, a pro-business PAC.</p>   </aside>\n<p>President Donald Trump last fall floated the idea of ending universal birthright citizenship by way of executive order.</p>\n<p>The reaction from the political and chattering classes was uniformly hysterical. Democrats called it racist. Many Republicans, including then-outgoing Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, dismissed the move as &ldquo;obviously&rdquo; unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>Yet the case for ending birthright citizenship is quite strong, on both legal and economic grounds.</p>\n<p>The text of the Constitution does not define who qualifies for American citizenship, and it gives Congress exclusive power over naturalization. The 14th Amendment, which Congress passed in 1868 to enshrine core legal rights for newly freed slaves and their children, grants citizenship to &ldquo;all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That last clause&mdash;&rdquo;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&rdquo;&mdash;generates the current controversy over birthright citizenship. Advocates of the status quo argue that a child born to illegal immigrants or tourists clearly qualifies, since the newborn child is &ldquo;subject&rdquo; to our laws.</p>\n<p>The federal government has adhered to this interpretation only since 1940.</p>\n<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/10/30/birthright-citizenship-a-fundamental-misunderstanding-of-the-14th-amendment/\">Birthright Citizenship: A Fundamental Misunderstanding of the 14th Amendment</a></strong></p>\n<p>Nowadays, each year approximately <a href=\"http://cis.org/birthright-citizenship-for-visitors\">200,000 children</a> are born in the United States to foreign tourists, students, and temporary guest workers, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. And roughly the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/26/number-of-babies-born-to-unauthorized-immigrants-in-u-s-continues-to-decline/\">same number</a> are born to illegal immigrants, according to Pew Research. The government grants U.S. citizenship to all of them.</p>\n<p>The 14th Amendment&rsquo;s authors would have disagreed with this practice. Sen. Lyman Trumbull of Wisconsin, a key voice in the adoption of the amendment, <a href=\"https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc30867/m1/15/?q=not%20owing%20allegiance%20to%20anybody%20else\">explicitly</a> said the phrase &ldquo;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&rdquo; means &ldquo;[n]ot owing allegiance to anyone else,&rdquo; namely, a foreign government. He went on to say, &ldquo;It is only those persons who come completely within our jurisdiction, who are subject to our laws, that we think of making citizens.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This is a reference to &ldquo;partial, territorial jurisdiction.&rdquo; As John Eastman, former dean of the Chapman School of Law, has <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/08/birthright-citizenship-reform-it-without-repealing-14th-amendment/\">said</a>, this is different from &ldquo;complete political jurisdiction,&rdquo; which entails allegiance to the political sovereign.</p>\n<p>Just a few years after the amendment&rsquo;s adoption, the Supreme Court confirmed that birthright citizenship is not universal. In the Slaughter-House cases of 1872, the court said the jurisdiction clause was intended to exclude &ldquo;children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign states born within the United States.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In other words, the amendment&rsquo;s framers didn&rsquo;t intend to grant citizenship to people who owed loyalty to a foreign government or tribe even though they were born on U.S. soil. In fact, it wasn&rsquo;t until 1924 that Congress decided to offer citizenship to Native Americans and their children.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, modern interpretations of the 14th Amendment continue to ignore the authors&rsquo; clear intent&mdash;a fact that many foreign nationals exploit.</p>\n<p>Consider the perverse practice of birth tourism, in which foreigners sneak across the border or come to the United States legally on tourist visas, give birth in U.S. hospitals, and then return home with their children. Once those children grow up, they can sponsor their parents, spouses, and siblings for green cards. Up to <a href=\"https://cis.org/Camarota/There-Are-Possibly-36000-Birth-Tourists-Annually\">36,000 birth tourism babies</a> gain citizenship each year, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.</p>\n<p>The United States is one of the only developed nations in the world that offers birthright citizenship to the children of tourists and illegal immigrants. All European Union countries have abolished the practice of granting birthright citizenship irrespective of the parents&rsquo; immigration status. So have Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The president wouldn&rsquo;t need an act of Congress to change how executive agencies interpret and apply the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s jurisdictional clause. He could simply instruct the Social Security Administration and State Department to issue Social Security numbers and passports only to children born to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.</p>\n<p>The executive branch previously exercised this authority in 1995 when the State Department barred automatic citizenship for children born to foreign diplomats.</p>\n<p>These concerns over who is eligible to birthright citizenship are more than just legal and constitutional. The status quo encourages more illegal immigration, which ultimately harms American taxpayers.</p>\n<p>Foreigners know that if they illegally journey to the United States and give birth, their children will be eligible for a host of welfare benefits&mdash;and the parents can share in these spoils. <a href=\"https://cis.org/sites/default/files/camarota-welfare-illegals_1.pdf\">Eighty-seven percent</a> of households headed by illegal immigrant parents utilize at least one welfare program, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. By contrast, <a href=\"https://cis.org/sites/default/files/camarota-welfare-illegals_1.pdf\">only half</a> of native households rely on any form of welfare.</p>\n<p>States are flailing under this financial burden. The average California household, for instance, pays <a href=\"https://fairus.org/issue/workforce-economy/infographic-fiscal-burden-illegal-immigration-californians\">nearly $2,400 a year</a> to support the state&rsquo;s illegal immigrant population, which, at almost 3 million, is the largest in the country. The total cost to the country as a whole is <a href=\"https://fairus.org/issue/publications-resources/fiscal-burden-illegal-immigration-united-states-taxpayers\">$135 billion a year</a>, by one estimate.</p>\n<p>Ending universal birthright citizenship would help deter illegal immigration and provide substantial relief to American taxpayers. Let&rsquo;s hope the president moves forward with his executive order.</p>",

                "text": "Walter Myers III is an adjunct lecturer at Biola University and a small business owner with over two decades of experience at America's leading technology firms. He serves as program chairperson for the Lincoln Club of Orange County, a pro-business PAC.\nPresident Donald Trump last fall floated the idea of ending universal birthright citizenship by way of executive order.\nThe reaction from the political and chattering classes was uniformly hysterical. Democrats called it racist. Many Republicans, including then-outgoing Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, dismissed the move as \u201cobviously\u201d unconstitutional.\nYet the case for ending birthright citizenship is quite strong, on both legal and economic grounds.\nThe text of the Constitution does not define who qualifies for American citizenship, and it gives Congress exclusive power over naturalization. The 14th Amendment, which Congress passed in 1868 to enshrine core legal rights for newly freed slaves and their children, grants citizenship to \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d\nThat last clause\u2014\u201dsubject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d\u2014generates the current controversy over birthright citizenship. Advocates of the status quo argue that a child born to illegal immigrants or tourists clearly qualifies, since the newborn child is \u201csubject\u201d to our laws.\nThe federal government has adhered to this interpretation only since 1940.\n>>> Birthright Citizenship: A Fundamental Misunderstanding of the 14th Amendment\nNowadays, each year approximately 200,000 children are born in the United States to foreign tourists, students, and temporary guest workers, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. And roughly the same number are born to illegal immigrants, according to Pew Research. The government grants U.S. citizenship to all of them.\nThe 14th Amendment\u2019s authors would have disagreed with this practice. Sen. Lyman Trumbull of Wisconsin, a key voice in the adoption of the amendment, explicitly said the phrase \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d means \u201c[n]ot owing allegiance to anyone else,\u201d namely, a foreign government. He went on to say, \u201cIt is only those persons who come completely within our jurisdiction, who are subject to our laws, that we think of making citizens.\u201d\nThis is a reference to \u201cpartial, territorial jurisdiction.\u201d As John Eastman, former dean of the Chapman School of Law, has said, this is different from \u201ccomplete political jurisdiction,\u201d which entails allegiance to the political sovereign.\nJust a few years after the amendment\u2019s adoption, the Supreme Court confirmed that birthright citizenship is not universal. In the Slaughter-House cases of 1872, the court said the jurisdiction clause was intended to exclude \u201cchildren of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign states born within the United States.\u201d\nIn other words, the amendment\u2019s framers didn\u2019t intend to grant citizenship to people who owed loyalty to a foreign government or tribe even though they were born on U.S. soil. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until 1924 that Congress decided to offer citizenship to Native Americans and their children.\nNonetheless, modern interpretations of the 14th Amendment continue to ignore the authors\u2019 clear intent\u2014a fact that many foreign nationals exploit.\nConsider the perverse practice of birth tourism, in which foreigners sneak across the border or come to the United States legally on tourist visas, give birth in U.S. hospitals, and then return home with their children. Once those children grow up, they can sponsor their parents, spouses, and siblings for green cards. Up to 36,000 birth tourism babies gain citizenship each year, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.\nThe United States is one of the only developed nations in the world that offers birthright citizenship to the children of tourists and illegal immigrants. All European Union countries have abolished the practice of granting birthright citizenship irrespective of the parents\u2019 immigration status. So have Australia and New Zealand.\nThe president wouldn\u2019t need an act of Congress to change how executive agencies interpret and apply the 14th Amendment\u2019s jurisdictional clause. He could simply instruct the Social Security Administration and State Department to issue Social Security numbers and passports only to children born to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.\nThe executive branch previously exercised this authority in 1995 when the State Department barred automatic citizenship for children born to foreign diplomats.\nThese concerns over who is eligible to birthright citizenship are more than just legal and constitutional. The status quo encourages more illegal immigration, which ultimately harms American taxpayers.\nForeigners know that if they illegally journey to the United States and give birth, their children will be eligible for a host of welfare benefits\u2014and the parents can share in these spoils. Eighty-seven percent of households headed by illegal immigrant parents utilize at least one welfare program, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. By contrast, only half of native households rely on any form of welfare.\nStates are flailing under this financial burden. The average California household, for instance, pays nearly $2,400 a year to support the state\u2019s illegal immigrant population, which, at almost 3 million, is the largest in the country. The total cost to the country as a whole is $135 billion a year, by one estimate.\nEnding universal birthright citizenship would help deter illegal immigration and provide substantial relief to American taxpayers. Let\u2019s hope the president moves forward with his executive order.",

There is little racism in America.</p>\n<p>2. The left&mdash;white and black&mdash;is morally and psychologically impaired.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that most Americans on the left, including black Americans, are distraught over the fact that Smollett faked the &ldquo;racist&rdquo; attack on him. Apparently, leftists, Democratic leaders, and, most depressingly, many of his fellow blacks wish Smollett had been attacked by white racist homophobes.</p>\n<p>Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a white leftist, tweeted, &ldquo;I hope this was not something that Mr. Smollett did to himself, or created &hellip; .&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart told MSNBC there has been &ldquo;an atmosphere of menace and hate&rdquo; since Donald Trump was elected president, which made &ldquo;people want to believe&rdquo; Smollett&rsquo;s story. Exactly. Capehart, a black leftist, wanted to believe that racists yelling &ldquo;This is MAGA country&rdquo; beat up blacks.</p>\n<p>Another black leftist who writes hate columns for The Washington Post, Nana Efua Mumford, wrote: &ldquo;I wanted to believe Smollett. I really did.&rdquo; Again, exactly. Mumford wanted to believe that racists yelling &ldquo;This is MAGA country&rdquo; beat up blacks.</p>\n<p>Corey Townsend, the social media editor of The Root, a black-oriented website (founded in 2008 by Harvard black studies scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.), opened his column on his private doubts that Smollett was attacked as he claimed with the words, &ldquo;I wanted to be wrong.&rdquo; Three paragraphs later: &ldquo;But still, I wanted to be wrong.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This should tell you a great deal about how morally and psychologically sick the left is. And their reactions prove how little racism there really is in America.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the proof of both these assertions: When American Jews, even most left-wing Jews, heard of the mass killing of Jews at a Pittsburgh synagogue, how many were hoping the shooter was truly an anti-Semite, and how many were hoping he was a mentally deranged individual who could have just as easily shot up a church?</p>\n<p>Or, if a well-known Jew had been beaten at 2 a.m. on a Chicago street, how many American Jews would have wanted the attackers to be Jew-haters, and how many would have wished they were just thugs who wanted money?</p>\n<p>As a Jew who has been deeply involved in Jewish culture all my life, I am pretty certain the majority of Jews&mdash;certainly liberal and conservative Jews, and even most left-wing Jews&mdash;would have wished that neither the Pittsburgh synagogue nor the theoretical attack on a Chicago street I conjured up were perpetrated by anti-Semites.</p>\n<p>Why is that? Why do almost all Jews wish attackers of Jews not be anti-Semites, but so many blacks and so many white leftists wish Smollett had been attacked by racists?</p>\n<p>Because Jews want to believe there is little anti-Semitism in America while most black leftists and most white leftists want to believe there is a lot of racism in America.</p>\n<p>And why is that? Because the left and many American blacks are politically and personally dependent on one of the greatest mass libels in history&mdash;namely, that America is a racist country.</p>\n<p>If just 1 of 5 black Americans woke up tomorrow and announced, &ldquo;You know, this a great country for anyone, including a black person, to live in, and the truth is the vast majority of white Americans bear no ill will toward blacks (or any other race or ethnicity),&rdquo; that would end the Democrats&rsquo; chances of winning national elections. The Democratic Party is dependent on nearly universal black acceptance of the leftist libel of America.</p>\n<p>And what about the personal? Why do so many black Americans, living in the freest country for all its citizens&mdash;and in the least racist multiracial, multiethnic country in history&mdash;want to believe America is racist? That is one of the most important questions all Americans need address at this time.</p>\n<p>And there is another one, which I posed in my column last week: Does the left believe its own lies?</p>",

                "text": "Dennis Prager is a columnist for The Daily Signal, nationally syndicated radio host, and creator of PragerU.\nThe reactions of many on the left to the case of Jussie Smollett prove two important things:\n1. There is little racism in America.\n2. The left\u2014white and black\u2014is morally and psychologically impaired.\nThere is no doubt that most Americans on the left, including black Americans, are distraught over the fact that Smollett faked the \u201cracist\u201d attack on him. Apparently, leftists, Democratic leaders, and, most depressingly, many of his fellow blacks wish Smollett had been attacked by white racist homophobes.\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a white leftist, tweeted, \u201cI hope this was not something that Mr. Smollett did to himself, or created \u2026 .\u201d\nWashington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart told MSNBC there has been \u201can atmosphere of menace and hate\u201d since Donald Trump was elected president, which made \u201cpeople want to believe\u201d Smollett\u2019s story. Exactly. Capehart, a black leftist, wanted to believe that racists yelling \u201cThis is MAGA country\u201d beat up blacks.\nAnother black leftist who writes hate columns for The Washington Post, Nana Efua Mumford, wrote: \u201cI wanted to believe Smollett. I really did.\u201d Again, exactly. Mumford wanted to believe that racists yelling \u201cThis is MAGA country\u201d beat up blacks.\nCorey Townsend, the social media editor of The Root, a black-oriented website (founded in 2008 by Harvard black studies scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.), opened his column on his private doubts that Smollett was attacked as he claimed with the words, \u201cI wanted to be wrong.\u201d Three paragraphs later: \u201cBut still, I wanted to be wrong.\u201d\nThis should tell you a great deal about how morally and psychologically sick the left is. And their reactions prove how little racism there really is in America.\nHere\u2019s the proof of both these assertions: When American Jews, even most left-wing Jews, heard of the mass killing of Jews at a Pittsburgh synagogue, how many were hoping the shooter was truly an anti-Semite, and how many were hoping he was a mentally deranged individual who could have just as easily shot up a church?\nOr, if a well-known Jew had been beaten at 2 a.m. on a Chicago street, how many American Jews would have wanted the attackers to be Jew-haters, and how many would have wished they were just thugs who wanted money?\nAs a Jew who has been deeply involved in Jewish culture all my life, I am pretty certain the majority of Jews\u2014certainly liberal and conservative Jews, and even most left-wing Jews\u2014would have wished that neither the Pittsburgh synagogue nor the theoretical attack on a Chicago street I conjured up were perpetrated by anti-Semites.\nWhy is that? Why do almost all Jews wish attackers of Jews not be anti-Semites, but so many blacks and so many white leftists wish Smollett had been attacked by racists?\nBecause Jews want to believe there is little anti-Semitism in America while most black leftists and most white leftists want to believe there is a lot of racism in America.\nAnd why is that? Because the left and many American blacks are politically and personally dependent on one of the greatest mass libels in history\u2014namely, that America is a racist country.\nIf just 1 of 5 black Americans woke up tomorrow and announced, \u201cYou know, this a great country for anyone, including a black person, to live in, and the truth is the vast majority of white Americans bear no ill will toward blacks (or any other race or ethnicity),\u201d that would end the Democrats\u2019 chances of winning national elections. The Democratic Party is dependent on nearly universal black acceptance of the leftist libel of America.\nAnd what about the personal? Why do so many black Americans, living in the freest country for all its citizens\u2014and in the least racist multiracial, multiethnic country in history\u2014want to believe America is racist? That is one of the most important questions all Americans need address at this time.\nAnd there is another one, which I posed in my column last week: Does the left believe its own lies?",

Telfer led Franklin Pierce&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s track team into the top 25 rankings for the first time in program&rsquo;s history, local newspaper The Keene Sentinel <a href=\"https://www.sentinelsource.com/sports/local_sports/franklin-pierce-women-s-track-earns-first-ever-top-/article_33e6dad6-4302-5acc-978d-ffc1b1c372ff.html\">reported</a> in December.

Telfer&rsquo;s best time in the 55-meter dash is <a href=\"https://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/Division/Top.aspx?DivID=102354&gender=f\">tied with the third-fastest runner</a> at the women&rsquo;s DI level.</p>\n<p>Telfer previously ran a variety of events for Franklin Pierce&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s team, during most of which time he went by the first name Craig, according to school records.</p>\n<p>Telfer competed on Franklin Pierce&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s team <a href=\"https://www.tfrrs.org/results/53227/3248801/Middlebury_Winter_Classic/400/\">as recently as January 2018</a>, according to published meet results from the Middlebury Winter Classic in Vermont. By that point Telfer had started using the name CeCe, while still competing on the men&rsquo;s team.</p>\n<p>NCAA policy is that male athletes who identify as transgender can compete on women&rsquo;s teams if they suppress their testosterone levels for a full calendar year. Otherwise, so-called mixed teams&mdash;which have both males and females&mdash;can compete in the men&rsquo;s division, but not in the women&rsquo;s division, according to NCAA rules.</p>\n<p>The NCAA in 2011 published<a href=\"https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Transgender_Handbook_2011_Final.pdf\"> an explainer</a> calling it &ldquo;not well founded&rdquo; to assume &ldquo;that being born with a male body automatically gives a transgender woman an unfair advantage when competing against non-transgender women.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Transgender women display a great deal of physical variation, just as there is a great deal of natural variation in physical size and ability among non-transgender women and men. Many people may have a stereotype that all transgender women are unusually tall and have large bones and muscles. But that is not true,&rdquo; the explainer states.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A male-to-female transgender woman may be small and slight, even if she is not on hormone blockers or taking estrogen. It is important not to overgeneralize. The assumption that all male-bodied people are taller, stronger, and more highly skilled in a sport than all female-bodied people is not accurate,&rdquo; it continues.</p>\n<p>Telfer&rsquo;s success in the women&rsquo;s division, which was <a href=\"https://turtleboysports.com/franklin-pierces-craig-telfer-becomes-cece-taylor-as-a-senior-and-won-3-events-at-the-northeast-10-conference-championships/\">first highlighted</a> by sports blog Turtleboy Sports, is the latest example of biological males who identify as transgender women <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/10/16/cyclist-transgender-win-unfair/\">piling up</a> <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2016/06/03/high-school-boy-wins-all-state-honors-in-girls-track-and-field/\">victories</a> <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2016/11/22/its-absolutely-huge-biological-male-dominates-womens-cycling-competition/\">in women&rsquo;s sports</a>.</p>\n<p>Two biologically male high schoolers in Connecticut, Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood, are <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/02/24/male-runners-connecticut-track/\">dominating girls track</a> in the state.

                "text": "A top-ranked runner in NCAA women\u2019s track is dominating the competition and setting records one year after competing as a man at the same level.\nFranklin Pierce University senior CeCe Telfer leads the NCAA\u2019s Division II women\u2019s division in the 55-meter dash and 55-meter hurdle events. Telfer led Franklin Pierce\u2019s women\u2019s track team into the top 25 rankings for the first time in program\u2019s history, local newspaper The Keene Sentinel reported in December. The New Hampshire college is ranked 14th in DII.\n\u201cSenior CeCe Telfer (Lebanon, N.H.) won three Northeast-10 Conference titles on Sunday, to lead the Franklin Pierce University women\u2019s track & field team and earn Most Outstanding Track Athlete honors at the NE10 Championships, hosted by American International College, on the campus of Smith College,\u201d reads a Feb. 17 article the school\u2019s athletic department posted.\nTelfer broke the conference finals record at the meet and qualified for three different events at March\u2019s NCAA championships, the article noted.\nTelfer is one of the fastest runners in NCAA women\u2019s track and field at any division\u2014not just at the DII level. Telfer\u2019s best time in the 55-meter dash is tied with the third-fastest runner at the women\u2019s DI level.\nTelfer previously ran a variety of events for Franklin Pierce\u2019s men\u2019s team, during most of which time he went by the first name Craig, according to school records.\nTelfer competed on Franklin Pierce\u2019s men\u2019s team as recently as January 2018, according to published meet results from the Middlebury Winter Classic in Vermont. By that point Telfer had started using the name CeCe, while still competing on the men\u2019s team.\nNCAA policy is that male athletes who identify as transgender can compete on women\u2019s teams if they suppress their testosterone levels for a full calendar year. Otherwise, so-called mixed teams\u2014which have both males and females\u2014can compete in the men\u2019s division, but not in the women\u2019s division, according to NCAA rules.\nThe NCAA in 2011 published an explainer calling it \u201cnot well founded\u201d to assume \u201cthat being born with a male body automatically gives a transgender woman an unfair advantage when competing against non-transgender women.\u201d\n\u201cTransgender women display a great deal of physical variation, just as there is a great deal of natural variation in physical size and ability among non-transgender women and men. Many people may have a stereotype that all transgender women are unusually tall and have large bones and muscles. But that is not true,\u201d the explainer states.\n\u201cA male-to-female transgender woman may be small and slight, even if she is not on hormone blockers or taking estrogen. It is important not to overgeneralize. The assumption that all male-bodied people are taller, stronger, and more highly skilled in a sport than all female-bodied people is not accurate,\u201d it continues.\nTelfer\u2019s success in the women\u2019s division, which was first highlighted by sports blog Turtleboy Sports, is the latest example of biological males who identify as transgender women piling up victories in women\u2019s sports.\nTwo biologically male high schoolers in Connecticut, Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood, are dominating girls track in the state. The two teens are among the fastest high school sprinters in the country\u2014though only in the girls division.\nOne of Miller\u2019s and Yearwood\u2019s female competitors, fellow junior Selina Soule, told the Associated Press that it was unfair to force female high schoolers to compete against male athletes.\n\u201cWe all know the outcome of the race before it even starts; it\u2019s demoralizing,\u201d Soule said. \u201cI fully support and am happy for these athletes for being true to themselves. They should have the right to express themselves in school, but athletics have always had extra rules to keep the competition fair,\u201d she added.\nOne of the top scorers for Australia\u2019s women\u2019s handball team is Hannah Mouncey, who played for the Australian men\u2019s handball team before transitioning. Mouncey played women\u2019s Australian rules football between transitioning and switching to women\u2019s handball.\nMouncey was banned from the women\u2019s division of the Australian Football League\u2019s women\u2019s division in October 2017 before receiving approval to play in February 2018.\nRachel McKinnon, a biologically male college professor who identifies as a transgender woman, won a women\u2019s cycling world championship in October. McKinnon won the women\u2019s sprint 35-39 age bracket at the 2018 UCI Masters Track Cycling World Championships in Los Angeles.\nMcKinnon in January 2018 was quoted in USA Today arguing against requiring biological males to suppress testosterone as a requirement for competing against women.\n\u201cWe cannot have a woman legally recognized as a trans woman in society, and not be recognized that way in sports,\u201d McKinnon told USA Today. \u201cFocusing on performance advantage is largely irrelevant because this is a rights issue. We shouldn\u2019t be worried about trans people taking over the Olympics. We should be worried about their fairness and human rights instead.\u201d\nDemocratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar called for an investigation into USA Powerlifting in January after the athletic association announced that male lifters who identify as transgender women aren\u2019t allowed to compete as women.\nOmar called it a \u201cmyth\u201d that men who identify as transgender women have a \u201cdirect competitive advantage\u201d in a Jan. 31 letter she sent to USA Powerlifting on behalf of Jaycee Cooper, a male powerlifter in Omar\u2019s district who identifies as a transgender woman.\nOmar copied Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on the letter, \u201cwith a recommendation that he investigate this discriminatory behavior.\u201d\nEllison said his office didn\u2019t have the jurisdiction to investigate USA Powerlifting, but recommended that Cooper \u201cfile a complaint with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.\u201d\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Not only would I have to deal with the legal and social repercussions, but I&rsquo;d have to worry about losing readers and followers, and confusing the TV hosts that I was just getting to know.</p>\n<p>In sum, I feared I&rsquo;d have to &ldquo;start over.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Plus, keeping my maiden name would afford me a level of legal protection should any stalkers arise.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, I wanted nothing more than to be unified with my husband and future children under the same last name, and for me, that pro outweighed all the cons.</p>\n<p>(Interestingly enough, feminists are now questioning why any woman would do this&mdash;as if keeping your father&rsquo;s last name will bring down the patriarchy.)</p>\n<p>In February, my husband and I took a belated two-week honeymoon. Upon my return, I was ready. &ldquo;This is it,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;Short-term pain for long-term gain.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The one thing I thought I had going for me was that blue checkmark on Twitter. In the most superficial way, I thought, &ldquo;This will show people that with my new last name, I&rsquo;m still legit.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With a bevy of social media accounts, bios, and more, I acted fast. Consistency, I thought, was key to avoiding confusion. I notified my IT department, all the organizations I work with, and swiftly changed my Twitter username. I was ecstatic to learn I could get <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelseybolar\">@KelseyBolar</a> without any weird characters. Things were going great.</p>\n<figure> <blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"><p>Back from an amazing, Twitter-free honeymoon! I&rsquo;m also excited to share that I&rsquo;m taking on my hubby&rsquo;s last name&hellip;Kelsey Bolar! (Pronounced like &ldquo;Polar&rdquo; but with a &ldquo;B&rdquo;?)So what&rsquo;d I miss? <a href=\"https://t.co/z0zvYVTpxD\">pic.twitter.com/z0zvYVTpxD</a></p>&mdash; Kelsey Bolar (Harkness) (@kelseybolar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelseybolar/status/1100146910353080320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 25, 2019</a></blockquote> </figure>\n<p>Until shortly after making the announcement&mdash;there was no longer a blue checkmark next to my Twitter handle.</p>\n<p>Caught up in a rush of fire and fury, my thumbs were ready to take to Twitter and accuse them of discriminating against me. How could a company that claims to be committed to &ldquo;<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/en_us/values/twitter-for-good.html\">equality</a>&rdquo; punish women for taking on their husbands&rsquo; last names?</p>\n<p>Given Twitter&rsquo;s reputation among conservatives, I was confident I&rsquo;d gin up enough outrage to publicly shame them into giving me the blue checkmark back. And, I&rsquo;d be fighting for a greater good. &ldquo;No one deserves to be punished for getting married!&rdquo; I thought.</p>\n<p>But as Ben Shapiro likes to say, &ldquo;Facts don&rsquo;t care about your feelings.&rdquo; And the fact is, Twitter had a policy for changing your last name that I was completely unaware of.</p>\n<p>I put my accusations on hold and decided to reach out to a contact at Twitter to explain the situation. In addition to detailing the mechanics, I shared the personal toll I feared my name change could have on my career, and how losing my (silly, superficial) status as a &ldquo;public figure&rdquo; on their platform was making it worse. In short, I took responsibility for failing to follow their policies, but explained it was unintentional.</p>\n<p>My contact responded in kind, and assured me someone would look into it.</p>\n<p>Out of the blue, less than two weeks later, my blue checkmark was back.</p>\n<p>If Twitter had refused to reinstate it, the social media giant would have deserved every ounce of outrage I was prepared to launch. But instead, I resisted the temptation and thereby avoided making false, salacious accusations. Because of that, the situation was handled in a respectful manner.</p>\n<p>This little scenario reminded me of a basic truth: Civil engagement must come before outrage. To be sure, some situations demand a fiery response, and not all situations get resolved like mine. But as a rule, we ought to engage with others in good faith rather than assuming the worst. You&mdash;and the culture we live in&mdash;will be better for it.</p>\n<p>As for my new last name, it&rsquo;s been weird getting used to being &ldquo;Kelsey Bolar.&rdquo; But already, it&rsquo;s worth it. Why? Because there&rsquo;s nothing like taking that final step to formally unite as husband and wife.</p>",

                "text": "After getting married, the decision to take on my husband\u2019s last name was a difficult one.\nIn addition to the financial cost and social awkwardness of changing your identity, the process is so labor-intensive that there\u2019s an app for that.\nSeriously.\nFor $99, you can \u201cchange your name in minutes\u201d on HitchSwitch, a concierge service that promises to \u201ctake the mystery, confusion, and stress out of changing your name.\u201d\nSounds like a deal.\nAs a public writer, producer, and commentator who spent years building name recognition, the decision to change my last name felt even more complicated. Not only would I have to deal with the legal and social repercussions, but I\u2019d have to worry about losing readers and followers, and confusing the TV hosts that I was just getting to know.\nIn sum, I feared I\u2019d have to \u201cstart over.\u201d\nPlus, keeping my maiden name would afford me a level of legal protection should any stalkers arise.\nBut ultimately, I wanted nothing more than to be unified with my husband and future children under the same last name, and for me, that pro outweighed all the cons.\n(Interestingly enough, feminists are now questioning why any woman would do this\u2014as if keeping your father\u2019s last name will bring down the patriarchy.)\nIn February, my husband and I took a belated two-week honeymoon. Upon my return, I was ready. \u201cThis is it,\u201d I thought. \u201cShort-term pain for long-term gain.\u201d\nThe one thing I thought I had going for me was that blue checkmark on Twitter. In the most superficial way, I thought, \u201cThis will show people that with my new last name, I\u2019m still legit.\u201d\nWith a bevy of social media accounts, bios, and more, I acted fast. Consistency, I thought, was key to avoiding confusion. I notified my IT department, all the organizations I work with, and swiftly changed my Twitter username. I was ecstatic to learn I could get @KelseyBolar without any weird characters. Things were going great.\nBack from an amazing, Twitter-free honeymoon!\nI\u2019m also excited to share that I\u2019m taking on my hubby\u2019s last name\u2026Kelsey Bolar! (Pronounced like \u201cPolar\u201d but with a \u201cB\u201d?)\nSo what\u2019d I miss? pic.twitter.com/z0zvYVTpxD\n\u2014 Kelsey Bolar (Harkness) (@kelseybolar) February 25, 2019\nUntil shortly after making the announcement\u2014there was no longer a blue checkmark next to my Twitter handle.\nCaught up in a rush of fire and fury, my thumbs were ready to take to Twitter and accuse them of discriminating against me. How could a company that claims to be committed to \u201cequality\u201d punish women for taking on their husbands\u2019 last names?\nGiven Twitter\u2019s reputation among conservatives, I was confident I\u2019d gin up enough outrage to publicly shame them into giving me the blue checkmark back. And, I\u2019d be fighting for a greater good. \u201cNo one deserves to be punished for getting married!\u201d I thought.\nBut as Ben Shapiro likes to say, \u201cFacts don\u2019t care about your feelings.\u201d And the fact is, Twitter had a policy for changing your last name that I was completely unaware of.\nI put my accusations on hold and decided to reach out to a contact at Twitter to explain the situation. In addition to detailing the mechanics, I shared the personal toll I feared my name change could have on my career, and how losing my (silly, superficial) status as a \u201cpublic figure\u201d on their platform was making it worse. In short, I took responsibility for failing to follow their policies, but explained it was unintentional.\nMy contact responded in kind, and assured me someone would look into it.\nOut of the blue, less than two weeks later, my blue checkmark was back.\nIf Twitter had refused to reinstate it, the social media giant would have deserved every ounce of outrage I was prepared to launch. But instead, I resisted the temptation and thereby avoided making false, salacious accusations. Because of that, the situation was handled in a respectful manner.\nThis little scenario reminded me of a basic truth: Civil engagement must come before outrage. To be sure, some situations demand a fiery response, and not all situations get resolved like mine. But as a rule, we ought to engage with others in good faith rather than assuming the worst. You\u2014and the culture we live in\u2014will be better for it.\nAs for my new last name, it\u2019s been weird getting used to being \u201cKelsey Bolar.\u201d But already, it\u2019s worth it. Why? Because there\u2019s nothing like taking that final step to formally unite as husband and wife.",

He is The New York Times best-selling author of &quot;Bullies.&quot; He is a graduate of UCLA and Harvard Law School, and lives with his wife and two children in Los Angeles.</p>   </aside>\n<p>Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., has unleashed a barrage of openly anti-Semitic commentary. She suggested that Israel had &ldquo;hypnotized the world.&rdquo; She recently suggested that Jewish money lay behind American support for Israel. Finally, she suggested that American Israel supporters are representatives of dual loyalty.</p>\n<p>Her fellow Democrats shielded her from blowback by subsuming a resolution that condemns her anti-Semitism within a broader resolution that condemns intolerance of all types.</p>\n<p>Many of them suggested that labeling Omar&rsquo;s anti-Semitism actually represents a type of censorship&mdash;an attempt to quash debate about Israel, though none of Omar&rsquo;s comments even critiqued the Israeli government, and though many on the left have made anti-Israel arguments without invoking anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>Now Omar&rsquo;s defenders have come out of the woodwork to suggest that criticism of her anti-Semitism was somehow responsible for the white supremacist shooting of 50 innocent people in a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand.</p>\n<p>Two protesters, New York University students and best friends Leen Dweik and Rose Asaf, confronted Chelsea Clinton, who had gently chided Omar for her Jew hatred.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;After all that you have done, all the Islamophobia that you have stoked,&rdquo; Dweik screamed, &ldquo;this, right here, is the result of a massacre stoked by people like you and the words you put out in the world. &hellip; Forty-nine people died because of the rhetoric you put out there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dweik, it should be noted, has called for the complete elimination of Israel.</p>\n<p>Her message was parroted by terror supporter Linda Sarsour, who tweeted: &ldquo;I am triggered by those who piled on Representative Ilhan Omar and incited a hate mob against her until she got assassination threats now giving condolences to our community. What we need you to do is reflect on how you contribute to islamophobia and stop doing that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, mainstream commentators attempted to use the New Zealand anti-Muslim terror attack to blame critics of radical Islam. Omer Aziz, writing for The New York Times, slammed Jordan Peterson for calling Islamophobia &ldquo;a word created by fascists&rdquo; and Sam Harris for calling it &ldquo;intellectual blood libel.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Bill Maher has come in for similar criticism; so have I, mostly for a video I cut in 2014 in which I read off poll statistics from various Muslim countries on a variety of topics, concluding that a huge percentage of Muslims believed radical things.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the truth: Radical Islam is dangerous. The Islamic world has a serious problem with radical Islam. And large swaths of the Muslim world are, in fact, hostile to Western views on matters ranging from freedom of speech to women&rsquo;s rights.</p>\n<p>To conflate that obvious truth with the desire to murder innocents in Christchurch is intellectual dishonesty of the highest sort. If we want more Muslims living in liberty and freedom, we must certainly demolish white supremacism&mdash;and we must also demolish radical Islam, devotees of which were responsible for an estimated 84,000 deaths in 2017 alone, most of those victims Muslim.</p>\n<p>And here&rsquo;s another truth: Anti-Semitism is ugly, whether it&rsquo;s coming from white supremacists or Ilhan Omar. Making that point has nothing to do with the killing of Muslims in Christchurch.</p>\n<p>So long as the media continue to push the narrative that criticism of Islam is tantamount to incitement of murder, radical Islam will continue to flourish.</p>\n<p>So long as the media continue to cover for the dishonest argument that criticism of anti-Semitism forwards the goals of white supremacists, anti-Semitism will continue to flourish. Honest discussion about hard issues isn&rsquo;t incitement.</p>",

                "text": "Ben Shapiro is host of \"The Ben Shapiro Show\" and editor-in-chief of DailyWire.com. He is The New York Times best-selling author of \"Bullies.\" He is a graduate of UCLA and Harvard Law School, and lives with his wife and two children in Los Angeles.\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., has unleashed a barrage of openly anti-Semitic commentary. She suggested that Israel had \u201chypnotized the world.\u201d She recently suggested that Jewish money lay behind American support for Israel. Finally, she suggested that American Israel supporters are representatives of dual loyalty.\nHer fellow Democrats shielded her from blowback by subsuming a resolution that condemns her anti-Semitism within a broader resolution that condemns intolerance of all types.\nMany of them suggested that labeling Omar\u2019s anti-Semitism actually represents a type of censorship\u2014an attempt to quash debate about Israel, though none of Omar\u2019s comments even critiqued the Israeli government, and though many on the left have made anti-Israel arguments without invoking anti-Semitism.\nNow Omar\u2019s defenders have come out of the woodwork to suggest that criticism of her anti-Semitism was somehow responsible for the white supremacist shooting of 50 innocent people in a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand.\nTwo protesters, New York University students and best friends Leen Dweik and Rose Asaf, confronted Chelsea Clinton, who had gently chided Omar for her Jew hatred.\n\u201cAfter all that you have done, all the Islamophobia that you have stoked,\u201d Dweik screamed, \u201cthis, right here, is the result of a massacre stoked by people like you and the words you put out in the world. \u2026 Forty-nine people died because of the rhetoric you put out there.\u201d\nDweik, it should be noted, has called for the complete elimination of Israel.\nHer message was parroted by terror supporter Linda Sarsour, who tweeted: \u201cI am triggered by those who piled on Representative Ilhan Omar and incited a hate mob against her until she got assassination threats now giving condolences to our community. What we need you to do is reflect on how you contribute to islamophobia and stop doing that.\u201d\nMeanwhile, mainstream commentators attempted to use the New Zealand anti-Muslim terror attack to blame critics of radical Islam. Omer Aziz, writing for The New York Times, slammed Jordan Peterson for calling Islamophobia \u201ca word created by fascists\u201d and Sam Harris for calling it \u201cintellectual blood libel.\u201d\nBill Maher has come in for similar criticism; so have I, mostly for a video I cut in 2014 in which I read off poll statistics from various Muslim countries on a variety of topics, concluding that a huge percentage of Muslims believed radical things.\nHere\u2019s the truth: Radical Islam is dangerous. The Islamic world has a serious problem with radical Islam. And large swaths of the Muslim world are, in fact, hostile to Western views on matters ranging from freedom of speech to women\u2019s rights.\nTo conflate that obvious truth with the desire to murder innocents in Christchurch is intellectual dishonesty of the highest sort. If we want more Muslims living in liberty and freedom, we must certainly demolish white supremacism\u2014and we must also demolish radical Islam, devotees of which were responsible for an estimated 84,000 deaths in 2017 alone, most of those victims Muslim.\nAnd here\u2019s another truth: Anti-Semitism is ugly, whether it\u2019s coming from white supremacists or Ilhan Omar. Making that point has nothing to do with the killing of Muslims in Christchurch.\nSo long as the media continue to push the narrative that criticism of Islam is tantamount to incitement of murder, radical Islam will continue to flourish.\nSo long as the media continue to cover for the dishonest argument that criticism of anti-Semitism forwards the goals of white supremacists, anti-Semitism will continue to flourish. Honest discussion about hard issues isn\u2019t incitement.",

Williams is a columnist for The Daily Signal and a professor of economics at George Mason University.</p>   </aside>\n<p>Federal prosecutors have charged more than 50 people involved in cheating and bribery in order to get their children admitted to some of the nation&rsquo;s most prestigious colleges and universities such as Georgetown, Yale, Stanford, University of Texas, University of Southern California, and UCLA. They often paid more than $100,000 to rig SAT or ACT exams.</p>\n<p>In some instances, they bribed college officials and secured their children&rsquo;s admissions to elite schools through various fraud schemes. As corrupt and depraved as these recent revelations are, they are only the tip of the iceberg of generalized college corruption and gross dishonesty.</p>\n<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 70 percent of white high school graduates in 2016 enrolled in college, and 58 percent of black high school graduates enrolled in college.</p>\n<p>However, that year only 37 percent of white high school graduates tested as college-ready but colleges admitted 70 percent of them. Roughly 17 percent of black high school graduates tested as college-ready but colleges admitted 58 percent of them.</p>\n<p>About 40 percent of college freshmen must take at least one remedial course. To deal with ill-prepared students, professors dumb down their courses so that students can get passing grades.</p>\n<p>Colleges also set up majors with little or no academic content so as to accommodate students with limited academic abilities. Such majors often include the term &ldquo;studies&rdquo;: ethnic studies, cultural studies, gender studies, or American studies.</p>\n<p>The major selected by the most ill-prepared students, sadly enough, is education. When students&rsquo; SAT scores are ranked by intended major, education majors place 26th on a list of 38.</p>\n<p>One gross example of administrative dishonesty surfaced at the University of North Carolina. A learning specialist hired to help UNC athletes found that 60 percent of the 183 members of the football and basketball teams read between fourth- and eighth-grade levels. About 10 percent read below a third-grade level.</p>\n<p>These athletes both graduated from high school and were admitted to UNC. More than likely, UNC is not alone in these practices because sports are the money-making center of many colleges.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to listen to college presidents, provosts, and other administrators talk for more than 15 minutes or so before the words diversity and inclusion drop from their lips. But there&rsquo;s a simple way to determine just how committed they are to their rhetoric.</p>\n<p>Ask your average college president, provost, or administrator whether he bothers promoting political diversity among faculty. I&rsquo;ll guarantee that if he is honest&mdash;or even answers the question&mdash;he will say he doesn&rsquo;t believe in that kind of diversity and inclusion.</p>\n<p>According to a recent study, professors who are registered Democrats outnumber their Republican counterparts by a 12-to-1 ratio. In some departments, such as history, Democratic registered professors outnumber their Republican counterparts by a 33-to-1 ratio.</p>\n<p>The fact is that when college presidents and their coterie talk about diversity and inclusion, they&rsquo;re talking mostly about pleasing mixtures of race and sex. Years ago, their agenda was called affirmative action, racial preferences, or racial quotas.</p>\n<p>These terms fell out of favor and usage as voters approved initiatives banning choosing by race, and courts found solely race-based admissions unconstitutional. People had to repackage their race-based agenda and call it diversity and inclusion.</p>\n<p>Some were bold enough to argue that &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; produces educational benefits to all students, including white students. Nobody has bothered to scientifically establish just what those benefits are.</p>\n<p>For example, does a racially diverse undergraduate student body lead to higher scores on graduate admissions tests such as the GRE, LSAT and MCAT?</p>\n<p>By the way, Israel, Japan, and South Korea are among the world&rsquo;s least racially diverse nations. In terms of academic achievement, their students run circles around diversity-crazed Americans.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about what can be done about education. But the first step toward any solution is for the American people to be aware of academic fraud that occurs at every level of education.</p>\n<p>COPYRIGHT 2019 CREATORS.COM</p>",

                "text": "Walter E. Williams is a columnist for The Daily Signal and a professor of economics at George Mason University.\nFederal prosecutors have charged more than 50 people involved in cheating and bribery in order to get their children admitted to some of the nation\u2019s most prestigious colleges and universities such as Georgetown, Yale, Stanford, University of Texas, University of Southern California, and UCLA. They often paid more than $100,000 to rig SAT or ACT exams.\nIn some instances, they bribed college officials and secured their children\u2019s admissions to elite schools through various fraud schemes. As corrupt and depraved as these recent revelations are, they are only the tip of the iceberg of generalized college corruption and gross dishonesty.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 70 percent of white high school graduates in 2016 enrolled in college, and 58 percent of black high school graduates enrolled in college.\nHowever, that year only 37 percent of white high school graduates tested as college-ready but colleges admitted 70 percent of them. Roughly 17 percent of black high school graduates tested as college-ready but colleges admitted 58 percent of them.\nAbout 40 percent of college freshmen must take at least one remedial course. To deal with ill-prepared students, professors dumb down their courses so that students can get passing grades.\nColleges also set up majors with little or no academic content so as to accommodate students with limited academic abilities. Such majors often include the term \u201cstudies\u201d: ethnic studies, cultural studies, gender studies, or American studies.\nThe major selected by the most ill-prepared students, sadly enough, is education. When students\u2019 SAT scores are ranked by intended major, education majors place 26th on a list of 38.\nOne gross example of administrative dishonesty surfaced at the University of North Carolina. A learning specialist hired to help UNC athletes found that 60 percent of the 183 members of the football and basketball teams read between fourth- and eighth-grade levels. About 10 percent read below a third-grade level.\nThese athletes both graduated from high school and were admitted to UNC. More than likely, UNC is not alone in these practices because sports are the money-making center of many colleges.\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to listen to college presidents, provosts, and other administrators talk for more than 15 minutes or so before the words diversity and inclusion drop from their lips. But there\u2019s a simple way to determine just how committed they are to their rhetoric.\nAsk your average college president, provost, or administrator whether he bothers promoting political diversity among faculty. I\u2019ll guarantee that if he is honest\u2014or even answers the question\u2014he will say he doesn\u2019t believe in that kind of diversity and inclusion.\nAccording to a recent study, professors who are registered Democrats outnumber their Republican counterparts by a 12-to-1 ratio. In some departments, such as history, Democratic registered professors outnumber their Republican counterparts by a 33-to-1 ratio.\nThe fact is that when college presidents and their coterie talk about diversity and inclusion, they\u2019re talking mostly about pleasing mixtures of race and sex. Years ago, their agenda was called affirmative action, racial preferences, or racial quotas.\nThese terms fell out of favor and usage as voters approved initiatives banning choosing by race, and courts found solely race-based admissions unconstitutional. People had to repackage their race-based agenda and call it diversity and inclusion.\nSome were bold enough to argue that \u201cdiversity\u201d produces educational benefits to all students, including white students. Nobody has bothered to scientifically establish just what those benefits are.\nFor example, does a racially diverse undergraduate student body lead to higher scores on graduate admissions tests such as the GRE, LSAT and MCAT?\nBy the way, Israel, Japan, and South Korea are among the world\u2019s least racially diverse nations. In terms of academic achievement, their students run circles around diversity-crazed Americans.\nI\u2019m not sure about what can be done about education. But the first step toward any solution is for the American people to be aware of academic fraud that occurs at every level of education.\nCOPYRIGHT 2019 CREATORS.COM",

Joining us to discuss is Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom here at The Heritage Foundation. Nile, thanks for being on.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nile Gardiner:</strong> It&rsquo;s my pleasure, thank you very much.</p>\n<p><strong>Davis: So, Nile, there&rsquo;s some background to get into on Brexit just from recent months, but I want to ask you, today, there is some good news, tell us what that is.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gardiner: </strong>Yes. The good news is that the European Union are sending some very negative messages on the extension of Article 50. Article 50, the Lisbon Treaty, governs the date of departure for Britain from the European Union. And the EU&rsquo;s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, just a couple of hours ago made it clear that everyone should prepare for a no-deal Brexit on March 29. So this is exactly the kind of message you want to hear if you believe in Brexit.</p>\n<p>And so, the EU is getting cold feet about going ahead with an extension for Article 50. That is good news. And any kind of signal coming from Brussels that the EU is uncertain about moving forward with an extension, this is a big positive.</p>\n<p>The ideal scenario for Britain really at the end of next week, March 29, is for Britain to crash out of the EU under a no-deal Brexit. That would be by far the best option right now considering all the alternatives that are in place.</p>\n<p><strong>Davis: So what does that mean in practice? What does that mean for visas, for trade, for all sorts of issues if they exit without a deal in place?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gardiner: </strong>A no-deal scenario simply means that Britain trades with the rest of the world under World Trade Organization rules and the British government has already declared that 86 percent of U.K. tariffs will be removed, actually, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p>\n<p>Some tariffs will remain in place. But compare that with the European Union, which implements tariffs on practically everything. And so, Britain then will look to sign free trade agreements with major countries across the world, including with the United States. Already there are very detailed discussions that have taken place on the U.S.-U.K. free trade agreement.</p>\n<p>In terms of dealing with the European Union, I don&rsquo;t think things are going to dramatically change. I think that there will be a willingness on the part of most countries in the European Union to continue business as usual with the U.K., otherwise it hits their exports.</p>\n<p>For example, Germany, which is a huge car producer, 18 percent of their car exports go to the U.K.. And so, for the Germans, they will quickly move forward, I think, with a mini agreement with the United Kingdom in the event of a no-deal to ensure that trade continues to move smoothly between the two countries.</p>\n<p>I suspect that most European countries will look to move forward with mini agreements, which have to be done, of course, through the European Union. But I think its in the interest of all EU countries to be able to move forward with these smaller agreements with the U.K. to ensure that trade, investment, exports, etc., continue as usual.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think that no-deal actually will result in any kind of major disruption. Temporarily in the first few days, I think some things will have to be worked out. But the reality is that British government has been preparing for a no-deal for a very long time. These preparations have been in place for many, many months.</p>\n<p>The British government has not been keen to advertise this because they have been keen to secure a deal with the European Union. The EU, however, has not treated Britain in good faith in terms of the negotiations.</p>\n<p>But rest assured, if there is a no-deal, the sky is not going to fall in and Britain will continue life as usual as the world&rsquo;s fifth-largest economy. And I think, from a U.S. perspective, a no-deal actually would be by far the best outcome right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Davis: Prime Minister Theresa May had a very difficult time finding an agreement between the EU and Parliament that would be agreeable to both sides. The vote on her deal failed multiple times. Is there doubt as to whether she will remain leader of Great Britain for the rest of the year?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gardiner: </strong>Yeah, I think Theresa May&rsquo;s days are numbered as prime minister. There&rsquo;s no doubt about it. She has suffered a collapse of authority over the last few weeks, last few months.</p>\n<p>You even have a situation whereby some of her own ministers are voting against her even though they have been subject to three-line whips. So there&rsquo;s a collapse of Cabinet in a collective responsibility and she cannot maintain control of her own government right now.</p>\n<p>There are many individuals inside the British government, including inside her own Cabinet, who are trying to derail Brexit and I think that these Cabinet ministers have played an extremely unhelpful role, but they&rsquo;re still in place. Their jobs are still there.</p>\n<p>Theresa May has lost all authority, frankly. I suspect Theresa May will step down at some stage later this year. And if indeed Brexit is brought in&mdash;either at the end of March or, as Theresa May is hoping for, at the end of June&mdash;I expect that she will step down soon after Brexit is implemented and that will pave the way for a Brexiteer prime minister, someone who is really fully invested in Brexit, to take over, which I think would be a far better alternative to having Theresa May stay as prime minister.</p>\n<p><strong>Kate Trinko: So it&rsquo;s been a while now since the Brexit vote. Why was it so important for Britain, can you remind us, to take this vote and what are the long-term implications of this leaving?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gardiner:</strong> I was there in the U.K. on the ground on the day of the vote and celebrated the results of Britain leaving the European Union. That&rsquo;s a great question, why is this so important?</p>\n<p>Well, Britain is part of the European Union, and bearing in mind that Britain has been part of the EU now for several decades, Britain has not been a fully sovereign country. So Britain at the moment has no control of its borders, it has no control of two-thirds of its laws, it has no control of its trades, its courts are subject to the rulings of European courts. Britain is, in many ways, a subject of the European Union.</p>\n<p>You have bureaucrats sitting in Brussels who decide a huge percentage of British law and this is an unacceptable situation. So the British people have said enough is enough and they want to have their freedom back.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Brexit is all about sovereignty and self-determination. The right of the British people to decide their own laws, shape their own future, trade freely with whoever they want to trade with across the world. And they will no longer have to take diktats from EU rules, really. This is what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>\n<p>The American people would never ever accept being told what to do by leaders in another country. It would be completely unthinkable and unacceptable. This is exactly the reality of the European Union today. So, Brexit is so hugely important in terms of what it represents for not just British sovereignty, but the principles of sovereignty and self-determination across the world today.</p>\n<p><strong>Davis: If Brexit does succeed, that does show that it&rsquo;s possible to leave the European Union and to go on to be a successful, prosperous nation. Do you think other countries in the EU are watching Britain&mdash;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gardiner: </strong>Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Davis: &hellip; and that that may encourage them to take similar steps?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gardiner:</strong> I think so. I think Brexit is being watched incredibly carefully by every country in the EU, which is why the EU elites fear Brexit so much because they fear the impact it will have upon other European countries.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think that right now any other country in the EU is preparing to leave the European Union and no other country is prepared to hold a vote on EU membership right now. Why? Because their leaders fear the outcome of those votes.</p>\n<p>If France, for example, held a vote on membership of the European Union, I think it would be very, very tight today. And I think in several other European countries, the vote would be very tight.</p>\n<p>In terms of other countries leaving the EU, that&rsquo;s a matter for those countries to decide. But I think if Brexit is a success, I would not be surprised if in the next decade or so, you may see two or three other countries leaving the European Union.</p>\n<p>It could become a flood in terms of an exit. And especially if some governments decide to actually hold referenda on EU membership, which could be a possibility in some countries in the next few years.</p>\n<p>So, Brexit is a big game-changer, which is why the European political elites fear it so much, hate it so much, why they&rsquo;ve made the terms of exit incredibly difficult. And they have treated the EU negotiations as a sort of punishment beating for Britain.</p>\n<p>An opinion poll came out in the U.K. this week showing that over 60 percent of Britons believe that the EU has treated the negotiations as a punishment for Britain. So that&rsquo;s where British public opinion is. It&rsquo;s a fair reflection of the reality here.</p>\n<p><strong>Trinko: So, very big picture here. Let&rsquo;s say that Britain does leave the EU on March 29, what does the political future look like for Britain as no longer being part of the EU? You&rsquo;ve talked about Theresa May&rsquo;s career being in flux, a lot of conservatives in the United States are concerned about the rise of Jeremy Corbyn. Do you think that this could fundamentally change the country in some ways, its political dynamic?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gardiner:</strong> Yeah, I think that Brexit will result in a more assertive and self-confident Britain. Because if you have foreign leaders deciding much of your own law and deciding who can come into your own country, for example, then there&rsquo;s a lack of self-confidence, which we&rsquo;re seeing among some people in Britain today who are opposed to Brexit, they don&rsquo;t really have the self-confidence in Britain&rsquo;s ability to lead.</p>\n<p>The reality is, I think, that Britain will be a far more assertive, stronger power on the world stage outside of the European Union. And that&rsquo;s what sovereignty and self-determination really delivers, as Americans know so well. These are incredibly powerful principles.</p>\n<p>I would expect that Britain will be more prosperous and also more assertive as a global leader in the Brexit era. And it&rsquo;s significant that in the run-up to Brexit, British unemployment has fallen to a 44-year low. And there continues to be a huge amount of foreign direct investment flowing into the U.K.</p>\n<p>U.S. foreign direct investment into Britain rose nearly 20 percentage points in 2017 alone, the last year we have the exact figures for, and it&rsquo;s a demonstration of the confidence that U.S. businesses have in Brexit.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve seen the likes of Google, Bloomberg, Apple, etc., setting up new headquarters in London in the last couple of years since the referendum, demonstrating that there&rsquo;s a great deal of business confidence in Britain doing well outside of the European Union because Britain will have lower taxes, they won&rsquo;t be subject to EU tariffs. Britain will also attract a lot of the best talent from all over the world as opposed to being subject to European Union migration laws and so on.</p>\n<p>So Britain will have a lot more control over who it brings into the country and I expect that Britain will seek to bring in the best talent from across the world into the U.K. in the Brexit era.</p>\n<p>All the indicators are that Britain will do very, very well under Brexit, will thrive and prosper. And you can&rsquo;t put a price on freedom, which is, at the end of the day, what Brexit is all about. And it&rsquo;s something Americans love dearly. The British people love freedom as well, but they haven&rsquo;t been able to exercise that freedom in the last 45 years or so. And now, they have the opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Davis: Before Brexit, there was the Scottish referendum. They chose to remain in the United Kingdom. Some have expressed concern that because Scotland was so largely in favor of remaining in the EU, that they may have second thoughts about remaining in the U.K. Do you believe that the United Kingdom itself will withstand Brexit?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gardiner:</strong> That&rsquo;s a very interesting point. So, in the Brexit era, since the 2016 referendum, support for Scottish nationalism has, if anything, fallen, actually. This is the most striking finding of opinion polls.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no momentum for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom and one of the reasons for that, of course, if indeed Scotland does leave the United Kingdom, it will also be outside of the European Union under Brexit. It would have to apply to join the European Union.</p>\n<p>Spain, for example, has indicated that they would strongly resist that because they have their own separatist concerns inside Spain with Catalonia. So the idea that the Scots could simply just rejoin the EU is not necessarily a reality.</p>\n<p>They would also be outside of NATO and they would have no real defense. Also, Scotland relies very heavily on subsidies, especially from England. So, there isn&rsquo;t really the appetite right now for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>I would expect if a vote were to be held in Scotland today, it would be even more heavily in favor of staying as part of the United Kingdom than in the last vote.</p>\n<p><strong>Trinko: Nile, thank you so much for joining us today.</strong></p>",

Elizabeth Warren is joining the liberal chorus to end the Electoral College.\nCanada\u2019s oldest rape crisis center has been stripped of public funding because it refuses to serve men who identify as women.\nThe Daily Signal podcast is available on Ricochet, iTunes, SoundCloud, Google Play, or Stitcher.

Enjoy the show!\nDaniel Davis: The Brexit situation has been looking grim, but there is some good news today. Joining us to discuss is Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom here at The Heritage Foundation. Nile, thanks for being on.\nNile Gardiner: It\u2019s my pleasure, thank you very much.\nDavis: So, Nile, there\u2019s some background to get into on Brexit just from recent months, but I want to ask you, today, there is some good news, tell us what that is.\nGardiner: Yes. The good news is that the European Union are sending some very negative messages on the extension of Article 50. Article 50, the Lisbon Treaty, governs the date of departure for Britain from the European Union. And the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, just a couple of hours ago made it clear that everyone should prepare for a no-deal Brexit on March 29. So this is exactly the kind of message you want to hear if you believe in Brexit.\nAnd so, the EU is getting cold feet about going ahead with an extension for Article 50. That is good news. And any kind of signal coming from Brussels that the EU is uncertain about moving forward with an extension, this is a big positive.\nThe ideal scenario for Britain really at the end of next week, March 29, is for Britain to crash out of the EU under a no-deal Brexit. That would be by far the best option right now considering all the alternatives that are in place.\nDavis: So what does that mean in practice? What does that mean for visas, for trade, for all sorts of issues if they exit without a deal in place?\nGardiner: A no-deal scenario simply means that Britain trades with the rest of the world under World Trade Organization rules and the British government has already declared that 86 percent of U.K. tariffs will be removed, actually, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\nSome tariffs will remain in place. But compare that with the European Union, which implements tariffs on practically everything. And so, Britain then will look to sign free trade agreements with major countries across the world, including with the United States. Already there are very detailed discussions that have taken place on the U.S.-U.K. free trade agreement.\nIn terms of dealing with the European Union, I don\u2019t think things are going to dramatically change. I think that there will be a willingness on the part of most countries in the European Union to continue business as usual with the U.K., otherwise it hits their exports.\nFor example, Germany, which is a huge car producer, 18 percent of their car exports go to the U.K.. And so, for the Germans, they will quickly move forward, I think, with a mini agreement with the United Kingdom in the event of a no-deal to ensure that trade continues to move smoothly between the two countries.\nI suspect that most European countries will look to move forward with mini agreements, which have to be done, of course, through the European Union. But I think its in the interest of all EU countries to be able to move forward with these smaller agreements with the U.K. to ensure that trade, investment, exports, etc., continue as usual.\nI don\u2019t think that no-deal actually will result in any kind of major disruption. Temporarily in the first few days, I think some things will have to be worked out. But the reality is that British government has been preparing for a no-deal for a very long time. These preparations have been in place for many, many months.\nThe British government has not been keen to advertise this because they have been keen to secure a deal with the European Union. The EU, however, has not treated Britain in good faith in terms of the negotiations.\nBut rest assured, if there is a no-deal, the sky is not going to fall in and Britain will continue life as usual as the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy. And I think, from a U.S. perspective, a no-deal actually would be by far the best outcome right now.\nDavis: Prime Minister Theresa May had a very difficult time finding an agreement between the EU and Parliament that would be agreeable to both sides. The vote on her deal failed multiple times. Is there doubt as to whether she will remain leader of Great Britain for the rest of the year?\nGardiner: Yeah, I think Theresa May\u2019s days are numbered as prime minister. There\u2019s no doubt about it. She has suffered a collapse of authority over the last few weeks, last few months.\nYou even have a situation whereby some of her own ministers are voting against her even though they have been subject to three-line whips. So there\u2019s a collapse of Cabinet in a collective responsibility and she cannot maintain control of her own government right now.\nThere are many individuals inside the British government, including inside her own Cabinet, who are trying to derail Brexit and I think that these Cabinet ministers have played an extremely unhelpful role, but they\u2019re still in place. Their jobs are still there.\nTheresa May has lost all authority, frankly. I suspect Theresa May will step down at some stage later this year. And if indeed Brexit is brought in\u2014either at the end of March or, as Theresa May is hoping for, at the end of June\u2014I expect that she will step down soon after Brexit is implemented and that will pave the way for a Brexiteer prime minister, someone who is really fully invested in Brexit, to take over, which I think would be a far better alternative to having Theresa May stay as prime minister.\nKate Trinko: So it\u2019s been a while now since the Brexit vote. Why was it so important for Britain, can you remind us, to take this vote and what are the long-term implications of this leaving?\nGardiner: I was there in the U.K. on the ground on the day of the vote and celebrated the results of Britain leaving the European Union. That\u2019s a great question, why is this so important?\nWell, Britain is part of the European Union, and bearing in mind that Britain has been part of the EU now for several decades, Britain has not been a fully sovereign country. So Britain at the moment has no control of its borders, it has no control of two-thirds of its laws, it has no control of its trades, its courts are subject to the rulings of European courts. Britain is, in many ways, a subject of the European Union.\nYou have bureaucrats sitting in Brussels who decide a huge percentage of British law and this is an unacceptable situation. So the British people have said enough is enough and they want to have their freedom back.\nAt the end of the day, Brexit is all about sovereignty and self-determination. The right of the British people to decide their own laws, shape their own future, trade freely with whoever they want to trade with across the world. And they will no longer have to take diktats from EU rules, really. This is what it\u2019s all about.\nThe American people would never ever accept being told what to do by leaders in another country. It would be completely unthinkable and unacceptable. This is exactly the reality of the European Union today. So, Brexit is so hugely important in terms of what it represents for not just British sovereignty, but the principles of sovereignty and self-determination across the world today.\nDavis: If Brexit does succeed, that does show that it\u2019s possible to leave the European Union and to go on to be a successful, prosperous nation. Do you think other countries in the EU are watching Britain\u2014\nGardiner: Yes.\nDavis: \u2026 and that that may encourage them to take similar steps?\nGardiner: I think so. I think Brexit is being watched incredibly carefully by every country in the EU, which is why the EU elites fear Brexit so much because they fear the impact it will have upon other European countries.\nI don\u2019t think that right now any other country in the EU is preparing to leave the European Union and no other country is prepared to hold a vote on EU membership right now. Why? Because their leaders fear the outcome of those votes.\nIf France, for example, held a vote on membership of the European Union, I think it would be very, very tight today. And I think in several other European countries, the vote would be very tight.\nIn terms of other countries leaving the EU, that\u2019s a matter for those countries to decide. But I think if Brexit is a success, I would not be surprised if in the next decade or so, you may see two or three other countries leaving the European Union.\nIt could become a flood in terms of an exit. And especially if some governments decide to actually hold referenda on EU membership, which could be a possibility in some countries in the next few years.\nSo, Brexit is a big game-changer, which is why the European political elites fear it so much, hate it so much, why they\u2019ve made the terms of exit incredibly difficult. And they have treated the EU negotiations as a sort of punishment beating for Britain.\nAn opinion poll came out in the U.K. this week showing that over 60 percent of Britons believe that the EU has treated the negotiations as a punishment for Britain. So that\u2019s where British public opinion is. It\u2019s a fair reflection of the reality here.\nTrinko: So, very big picture here. Let\u2019s say that Britain does leave the EU on March 29, what does the political future look like for Britain as no longer being part of the EU? You\u2019ve talked about Theresa May\u2019s career being in flux, a lot of conservatives in the United States are concerned about the rise of Jeremy Corbyn. Do you think that this could fundamentally change the country in some ways, its political dynamic?\nGardiner: Yeah, I think that Brexit will result in a more assertive and self-confident Britain. Because if you have foreign leaders deciding much of your own law and deciding who can come into your own country, for example, then there\u2019s a lack of self-confidence, which we\u2019re seeing among some people in Britain today who are opposed to Brexit, they don\u2019t really have the self-confidence in Britain\u2019s ability to lead.\nThe reality is, I think, that Britain will be a far more assertive, stronger power on the world stage outside of the European Union. And that\u2019s what sovereignty and self-determination really delivers, as Americans know so well. These are incredibly powerful principles.\nI would expect that Britain will be more prosperous and also more assertive as a global leader in the Brexit era. And it\u2019s significant that in the run-up to Brexit, British unemployment has fallen to a 44-year low. And there continues to be a huge amount of foreign direct investment flowing into the U.K.\nU.S. foreign direct investment into Britain rose nearly 20 percentage points in 2017 alone, the last year we have the exact figures for, and it\u2019s a demonstration of the confidence that U.S. businesses have in Brexit.\nYou\u2019ve seen the likes of Google, Bloomberg, Apple, etc., setting up new headquarters in London in the last couple of years since the referendum, demonstrating that there\u2019s a great deal of business confidence in Britain doing well outside of the European Union because Britain will have lower taxes, they won\u2019t be subject to EU tariffs. Britain will also attract a lot of the best talent from all over the world as opposed to being subject to European Union migration laws and so on.\nSo Britain will have a lot more control over who it brings into the country and I expect that Britain will seek to bring in the best talent from across the world into the U.K. in the Brexit era.\nAll the indicators are that Britain will do very, very well under Brexit, will thrive and prosper. And you can\u2019t put a price on freedom, which is, at the end of the day, what Brexit is all about. And it\u2019s something Americans love dearly. The British people love freedom as well, but they haven\u2019t been able to exercise that freedom in the last 45 years or so. And now, they have the opportunity to do so.\nDavis: Before Brexit, there was the Scottish referendum. They chose to remain in the United Kingdom. Some have expressed concern that because Scotland was so largely in favor of remaining in the EU, that they may have second thoughts about remaining in the U.K. Do you believe that the United Kingdom itself will withstand Brexit?\nGardiner: That\u2019s a very interesting point. So, in the Brexit era, since the 2016 referendum, support for Scottish nationalism has, if anything, fallen, actually. This is the most striking finding of opinion polls.\nThere\u2019s no momentum for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom and one of the reasons for that, of course, if indeed Scotland does leave the United Kingdom, it will also be outside of the European Union under Brexit. It would have to apply to join the European Union.\nSpain, for example, has indicated that they would strongly resist that because they have their own separatist concerns inside Spain with Catalonia. So the idea that the Scots could simply just rejoin the EU is not necessarily a reality.\nThey would also be outside of NATO and they would have no real defense. Also, Scotland relies very heavily on subsidies, especially from England. So, there isn\u2019t really the appetite right now for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom.\nI would expect if a vote were to be held in Scotland today, it would be even more heavily in favor of staying as part of the United Kingdom than in the last vote.\nTrinko: Nile, thank you so much for joining us today.",

To borrow a phrase from Pelosi: &ldquo;Show me your budget, show me your values.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Their backup option&mdash;a plan to just raise spending levels&mdash;was also pulled from the House floor because of a revolt on the far left that it wasn&rsquo;t costly enough.</p>\n<p>While House Democrats have kicked basic budget-writing to the curb, they have not been shy about offering a litany of big-spending proposals with no way to pay for them.</p>\n<p>At the top of the list is the Green New Deal. One estimate pegs its cost at a whopping $92 trillion. Between eliminating air travel and altering every building in the United States, the Green New Deal is an entirely unworkable proposal that dictates more taxation, regulation, and government control.</p>\n<p>The AFL-CIO criticized the plan, highlighting the crushing impact it would have on the economy and working families.</p>\n<p>On the House Energy and Commerce Committee, we have called for a hearing on the Green New Deal so the American people can better understand the proposal&rsquo;s consequences for the economy.</p>\n<p>So far, the Democrats have been unwilling.</p>\n<p>The so-called &ldquo;Medicare for All&rdquo; plan is another budget-buster. The price tag: $32 trillion. It would create a single-payer system, stripping health care away from nearly 160 million Americans who have coverage through a private and employer-sponsored plan.</p>\n<p>Under this government-run system, patients would lose their current plan and be faced with fewer choices and higher costs. Leaders of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which also has jurisdiction over health care policy, have likewise refused to hold a hearing on this big-ticket item.</p>\n<p>On the bedrock principle of the right to life, the Democrats have taken extremism to a whole new level.</p>\n<p>Recent polling shows that <a href=\"https://s27319.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/National-SBA-List-Slides-February.pdf\">77%</a> of Americans support legislation to ensure babies who survive an attempted abortion receive the same medical care under the law as any other newborn.</p>\n<p>Our bill, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, would prevent infanticide and safeguard these babies. Yet the Democratic majority, on 32 separate occasions, has <a href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/04/12/something-wrong-when-house-must-debate-born-alive-bill-lawmaker-says/\">blocked it</a> from receiving an up-or-down vote.</p>\n<p>These first 100 days have shone a spotlight on how disconnected House Democrats are from the rest of the country.</p>\n<p>At every turn, the recurring theme has been embracing a socialist agenda that takes power from the American people and centralizes it in Washington.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Americans have a better alternative to consider.</p>\n<p>The economy is thriving, and job creators are optimistic, thanks to the pro-growth tax and regulatory policies of President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. Unemployment remains below 4%, wages are climbing, and with more than 7 million job openings, the labor market is strong.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s no accident the time-proven principles of economic freedom are leading to greater opportunity for hardworking taxpayers. It&rsquo;s also no accident that Pelosi and her caucus are threatening these economic gains with greater government control.</p>\n<p>If my Democratic colleagues want to propose unaffordable policies, such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, then they should begin debating and voting on them in Congress&mdash;not just on cable news programs.

                "text": "As we pass the 100-day mark of Democratic control of the House of Representatives in the 116th Congress, now is a good opportunity to examine what the American people have to show for it.\nOn issue after issue, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Democratic majority has chosen a path of partisanship, rather than problem-solving.\nFrom ignoring the humanitarian crisis at the border to championing an impeachment resolution, it has been one exercise in out-of-touch politics after another.\nThe latest example is the House Democrats\u2019 failure to even propose a budget, a core responsibility of any congressional majority. To borrow a phrase from Pelosi: \u201cShow me your budget, show me your values.\u201d\nTheir backup option\u2014a plan to just raise spending levels\u2014was also pulled from the House floor because of a revolt on the far left that it wasn\u2019t costly enough.\nWhile House Democrats have kicked basic budget-writing to the curb, they have not been shy about offering a litany of big-spending proposals with no way to pay for them.\nAt the top of the list is the Green New Deal. One estimate pegs its cost at a whopping $92 trillion. Between eliminating air travel and altering every building in the United States, the Green New Deal is an entirely unworkable proposal that dictates more taxation, regulation, and government control.\nThe AFL-CIO criticized the plan, highlighting the crushing impact it would have on the economy and working families.\nOn the House Energy and Commerce Committee, we have called for a hearing on the Green New Deal so the American people can better understand the proposal\u2019s consequences for the economy.\nSo far, the Democrats have been unwilling.\nThe so-called \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan is another budget-buster. The price tag: $32 trillion. It would create a single-payer system, stripping health care away from nearly 160 million Americans who have coverage through a private and employer-sponsored plan.\nUnder this government-run system, patients would lose their current plan and be faced with fewer choices and higher costs. Leaders of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which also has jurisdiction over health care policy, have likewise refused to hold a hearing on this big-ticket item.\nOn the bedrock principle of the right to life, the Democrats have taken extremism to a whole new level.\nRecent polling shows that 77% of Americans support legislation to ensure babies who survive an attempted abortion receive the same medical care under the law as any other newborn.\nOur bill, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, would prevent infanticide and safeguard these babies. Yet the Democratic majority, on 32 separate occasions, has blocked it from receiving an up-or-down vote.\nThese first 100 days have shone a spotlight on how disconnected House Democrats are from the rest of the country.\nAt every turn, the recurring theme has been embracing a socialist agenda that takes power from the American people and centralizes it in Washington.\nThankfully, Americans have a better alternative to consider.\nThe economy is thriving, and job creators are optimistic, thanks to the pro-growth tax and regulatory policies of President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. Unemployment remains below 4%, wages are climbing, and with more than 7 million job openings, the labor market is strong.\nIt\u2019s no accident the time-proven principles of economic freedom are leading to greater opportunity for hardworking taxpayers. It\u2019s also no accident that Pelosi and her caucus are threatening these economic gains with greater government control.\nIf my Democratic colleagues want to propose unaffordable policies, such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, then they should begin debating and voting on them in Congress\u2014not just on cable news programs. That\u2019s the choice before us in the next 100 days and beyond.\nLet\u2019s get down to problem-solving and stop the partisanship.",

That&rsquo;s something that should be approved by the attorney general first,&rdquo; John Yoo, a former assistant U.S. attorney general under President George W. Bush, told The Daily Signal.</p>\n<p>Domestic spying <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-legacy-of-watergate-five-important-changes-after-the-scandal/\">on political opponents</a> was a big part of what prompted the FISA law in the 1970s after President Richard Nixon&rsquo;s administration, the goal being to put a check in place.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The whole point of FISA was because Nixon was spying on political opponents,&rdquo; said Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley. &ldquo;This seems to have violated the purpose of FISA, which is to make sure surveillance is always merited [and] is not political.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After the Watergate scandal, which led to Nixon&rsquo;s resignation, Congress was concerned about how the Nixon administration used the FBI and the CIA to target political opponents.</p>\n<p>Sen. Frank Church, D-Idaho, chaired a select Senate committee that investigated intelligence gathering. The 1978 FISA law was an outgrowth of what was called the Church Committee.</p>\n<p>Prosecutable crimes might have been committee by Justice Department personnel, said Robert Ray, who as an independent counsel completed the investigation of President Bill Clinton.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The FISA court is in place to ensure the careful use of tools in the tool box, and to have oversight of the potential collision with the political process,&rdquo; Ray told The Daily Signal. &ldquo;This is always a big deal when you mix politics and prosecutions and is always dangerous.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ray said the potential criminal charge that came to mind was perjury, if Justice Department lawyers seeking the FISA warrant were dishonest in making the application to the judge.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Intentionally misleading a court in a document that is sworn to under oath would be perjury,&rdquo; Ray said. &ldquo;But you would have to prove the person knowingly provided false information. Misleading might not be enough.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ray said the Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of Professional Responsibility might look at the matter, to determine whether an official committed an act that requires discipline or dismissal. The matter could be referred to the state bar of any practicing lawyer who is accused of providing misleading information.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If this matter has the attorney general&rsquo;s attention, then it is all on the table,&rdquo; Ray said. &ldquo;It could examine sending this to the OPR, whether there was commission of a crime, any and all of the above.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem likely that the FISA application was misleading, though, said Charles Stimson, a former federal prosecutor and former military judge.</p>\n<p>Stimson noted that a page in the FISA application for a warrant explained that the information was based on an opposition research dossier compiled by a former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele.</p>\n<p>Although the application did not say it was paid for by Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee, Stimson said, the application letter was clear that the document was opposition research directed against Trump.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;From a pure legal standpoint, it was accurate,&rdquo; Stimson, now manager of the national security law program at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It arguably wasn&rsquo;t completely forthcoming,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the fact is, a federal district court judge had the information and ruled on it and reauthorized surveillance. &hellip; There is a gray zone. It didn&rsquo;t say Hillary Clinton paid for it and that it wasn&rsquo;t verified.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>However, Stimson noted that a court could require Justice Department lawyers to explain why their lack of information in the application wasn&rsquo;t a case of trying to defraud the court. He also said a bar complaint could lead to the loss of a law license.</p>\n<p>But department lawyers have a reason to be forthcoming with FISA court judges, Stimson added.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is an ongoing relationship with the Department of Justice and those lawyers,&rdquo; Stimson said. &ldquo;The last thing these lawyers want to do is burn their credibility.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>David Kris, an assistant attorney general during the Obama administration, argues that although special counsel Robert Mueller found no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to give Trump an edge in the 2016 election, the larger Russia investigation itself&mdash;as well as the FISA warrant on Page&mdash;was still legitimate.</p>\n<p>Kris wrote in the <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/why-fbis-investigation-president-was-unavoidable\">Lawfare blog</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[T]here is the Steele dossier, which was first publicly revealed in January 2017, but was in the FBI&rsquo;s hands before then. People argue about the extent to which the Steele dossier has held up; the best and most recent assessment that I have seen, <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/steele-dossier-retrospective\">here</a>, is that it has held up quite well. <br></p><p>But in any event, the document was properly taken seriously then given Steele&rsquo;s history as a former British MI-6 officer and reliable informant (as documented in the Carter Page <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/95-carter-page-fisa-documents-foia-release/full/optimized.pdf\">FISA applications</a>). &hellip; There was a lot of justifiable investigative activity into the campaign and campaign officials and their relationship with Russia and the Russian government. <br></p></blockquote>\n<p>However, Stimson contends that Barr has legitimate reasons for wanting to review the matter that go beyond the FISA warrant.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The attorney general of the United States should want to know how a counterintelligence investigation against a leading presidential candidate began,&rdquo; Stimson said. &ldquo;He will want to look at the entire matter. How did it get to the point of a FISA warrant? Maybe it was predicated entirely on the dossier. Maybe there was some there there.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Actions by Justice Department officials in spying on a Donald Trump campaign adviser in 2016 could be a crime or merely an administrative offense, legal experts say.\nCrimes could include perjury or misleading a court, they say, while disciplinary action for an administrative offense could mean being fired or losing a law license.\nTestifying last week before two separate congressional panels, Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General report about the surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page will be released in May or June.\nBarr also indicated that he planned a further review of government \u201cspying\u201d on the Trump campaign.\nWhat\u2019s known is that the Obama administration\u2019s Justice Department obtained a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to conduct electronic surveillance on Page in October 2016.\nThe inspector general\u2019s review is looking at whether Justice Department or FBI officials did anything improper in obtaining the warrant approved by a federal judge.\n\u201cBefore looking at the legality, the department should examine the process behind getting a FISA warrant against a presidential campaign. That\u2019s something that should be approved by the attorney general first,\u201d John Yoo, a former assistant U.S. attorney general under President George W. Bush, told The Daily Signal.\nDomestic spying on political opponents was a big part of what prompted the FISA law in the 1970s after President Richard Nixon\u2019s administration, the goal being to put a check in place.\n\u201cThe whole point of FISA was because Nixon was spying on political opponents,\u201d said Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cThis seems to have violated the purpose of FISA, which is to make sure surveillance is always merited [and] is not political.\u201d\nAfter the Watergate scandal, which led to Nixon\u2019s resignation, Congress was concerned about how the Nixon administration used the FBI and the CIA to target political opponents.\nSen. Frank Church, D-Idaho, chaired a select Senate committee that investigated intelligence gathering. The 1978 FISA law was an outgrowth of what was called the Church Committee.\nProsecutable crimes might have been committee by Justice Department personnel, said Robert Ray, who as an independent counsel completed the investigation of President Bill Clinton.\n\u201cThe FISA court is in place to ensure the careful use of tools in the tool box, and to have oversight of the potential collision with the political process,\u201d Ray told The Daily Signal. \u201cThis is always a big deal when you mix politics and prosecutions and is always dangerous.\u201d\nRay said the potential criminal charge that came to mind was perjury, if Justice Department lawyers seeking the FISA warrant were dishonest in making the application to the judge.\n\u201cIntentionally misleading a court in a document that is sworn to under oath would be perjury,\u201d Ray said. \u201cBut you would have to prove the person knowingly provided false information. Misleading might not be enough.\u201d\nRay said the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility might look at the matter, to determine whether an official committed an act that requires discipline or dismissal. The matter could be referred to the state bar of any practicing lawyer who is accused of providing misleading information.\n\u201cIf this matter has the attorney general\u2019s attention, then it is all on the table,\u201d Ray said. \u201cIt could examine sending this to the OPR, whether there was commission of a crime, any and all of the above.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely that the FISA application was misleading, though, said Charles Stimson, a former federal prosecutor and former military judge.\nStimson noted that a page in the FISA application for a warrant explained that the information was based on an opposition research dossier compiled by a former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele.\nAlthough the application did not say it was paid for by Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee, Stimson said, the application letter was clear that the document was opposition research directed against Trump.\n\u201cFrom a pure legal standpoint, it was accurate,\u201d Stimson, now manager of the national security law program at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal.\n\u201cIt arguably wasn\u2019t completely forthcoming,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact is, a federal district court judge had the information and ruled on it and reauthorized surveillance. \u2026 There is a gray zone. It didn\u2019t say Hillary Clinton paid for it and that it wasn\u2019t verified.\u201d\nHowever, Stimson noted that a court could require Justice Department lawyers to explain why their lack of information in the application wasn\u2019t a case of trying to defraud the court. He also said a bar complaint could lead to the loss of a law license.\nBut department lawyers have a reason to be forthcoming with FISA court judges, Stimson added.\n\u201cThere is an ongoing relationship with the Department of Justice and those lawyers,\u201d Stimson said. \u201cThe last thing these lawyers want to do is burn their credibility.\u201d\nDavid Kris, an assistant attorney general during the Obama administration, argues that although special counsel Robert Mueller found no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to give Trump an edge in the 2016 election, the larger Russia investigation itself\u2014as well as the FISA warrant on Page\u2014was still legitimate.\nKris wrote in the Lawfare blog:\n[T]here is the Steele dossier, which was first publicly revealed in January 2017, but was in the FBI\u2019s hands before then. People argue about the extent to which the Steele dossier has held up; the best and most recent assessment that I have seen, here, is that it has held up quite well.\nBut in any event, the document was properly taken seriously then given Steele\u2019s history as a former British MI-6 officer and reliable informant (as documented in the Carter Page FISA applications). \u2026 There was a lot of justifiable investigative activity into the campaign and campaign officials and their relationship with Russia and the Russian government.\nHowever, Stimson contends that Barr has legitimate reasons for wanting to review the matter that go beyond the FISA warrant.\n\u201cThe attorney general of the United States should want to know how a counterintelligence investigation against a leading presidential candidate began,\u201d Stimson said. \u201cHe will want to look at the entire matter. How did it get to the point of a FISA warrant? Maybe it was predicated entirely on the dossier. Maybe there was some there there.\u201d",

Where Would Illegal Immigrants Be Transported?</strong></p>\n<p>More than 170 cities and counties have some sort of sanctuary law prohibiting local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration authorities, and in some cases jurisdictions may even obstruct enforcement. This includes most large cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s according to data from the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring strict immigration policies, which has a <a href=\"https://cis.org/Map-Sanctuary-Cities-Counties-and-States\">map of sanctuary cities</a> on its website. Local sanctuary jurisdictions span 26 states.</p>\n<p>California, home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who is highly critical of Trump, is a sanctuary state.</p>\n<p>Pelosi spokeswoman Ashley Etienne said in a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-fumes-over-white-house-plan-to-release-immigrant-detainees-in-sanctuary-cities\">statement Friday</a>: &ldquo;Using human beings&mdash;including little children&mdash;as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable, and in some cases, criminal.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not clear exactly how the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Customs and Border Protection as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would determine which sanctuary cities or counties would receive illegal immigrants.</p>\n<p>The entire matter is still under review, said Larry Kudlow, assistant to the president for economic policy and director of the National Economic Council.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that we will be transporting. I don&rsquo;t know that decision has been made. The president has talked about it. The decision is going to be up to him,&rdquo; Kudlow told The Daily Signal during a press gaggle Tuesday at the White House.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are searching for border security, that is so essential. We think a lot of changes in the [immigration] laws are going to be necessary,&rdquo; Kudlow said. &ldquo;At some point, in due course, he will make some determinations on that. We have not made decisions on a lot of these things.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Kudlow added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You can&rsquo;t tell me that he isn&rsquo;t right when <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/more-than-100000-migrants-apprehended-or-turned-away-at-border-in-march-cbp-reveals\">100,000 people</a> [a month] now are crossing the border illegally. You can&rsquo;t tell me something shouldn&rsquo;t be done. It&rsquo;s just common sense. It&rsquo;s an economic issue. It&rsquo;s a security issue. It&rsquo;s a drug trafficking issue. It&rsquo;s a kids trafficking issue. It&rsquo;s really insane. He will make the decision on that. It&rsquo;s not my call, it&rsquo;s his call.<br></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. Why Would Trump Want to Release Illegal Immigrants Anywhere in U.S.? </strong></p>\n<p>Trump doesn&rsquo;t want to release illegal border crossers, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement lacks detention space to hold them and there is a shortage of immigration judges to adjudicate deportation hearings and asylum claims.</p>\n<p>Under federal law, if an illegal border crosser claims asylum, authorities cannot send him or her back into Mexico. The matter must be adjudicated through a hearing.</p>\n<p>Those who claim asylum have to submit to a &ldquo;credible fear interview,&rdquo; while others face a deportation hearing before an immigration judge.</p>\n<p>It can take eight years before such a hearing is held, and many illegal immigrants don&rsquo;t show up for a hearing or interview. These circumstances lead to the de facto policy of &ldquo;catch and release&rdquo;&mdash;with the release being inside the country.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ideally, we shouldn&rsquo;t be releasing illegal immigrants into the country at all, but as long as there is a shortage of judges and Congress won&rsquo;t approve additional detention space for ICE, the government does,&rdquo; Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, told The Daily Signal.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To the degree Congress won&rsquo;t act, we might as well release them on the steps of San Francisco City Hall,&rdquo; Mehlman said. &ldquo;If you have to keep releasing people, you might as well release then in communities that say they want them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mehlman added: &ldquo;This puts sanctuary cities to the test.

                "text": "The Trump administration is exploring the legality of transporting illegal immigrants who the government can\u2019t detain to sanctuary cities, which by definition welcome illegal immigrants.\nProminent Democrats say they oppose the idea, and even supporters say President Donald Trump could be trolling Democrats in a public relations move.\nIf Trump moves forward with the notion, it almost certainly would be litigated.\nHere\u2019s a look at key questions surrounding the proposal.\n1. Where Would Illegal Immigrants Be Transported?\nMore than 170 cities and counties have some sort of sanctuary law prohibiting local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration authorities, and in some cases jurisdictions may even obstruct enforcement. This includes most large cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\nThat\u2019s according to data from the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring strict immigration policies, which has a map of sanctuary cities on its website. Local sanctuary jurisdictions span 26 states.\nCalifornia, home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who is highly critical of Trump, is a sanctuary state.\nPelosi spokeswoman Ashley Etienne said in a statement Friday: \u201cUsing human beings\u2014including little children\u2014as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable, and in some cases, criminal.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly how the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Customs and Border Protection as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would determine which sanctuary cities or counties would receive illegal immigrants.\nThe entire matter is still under review, said Larry Kudlow, assistant to the president for economic policy and director of the National Economic Council.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that we will be transporting. I don\u2019t know that decision has been made. The president has talked about it. The decision is going to be up to him,\u201d Kudlow told The Daily Signal during a press gaggle Tuesday at the White House.\n\u201cWe are searching for border security, that is so essential. We think a lot of changes in the [immigration] laws are going to be necessary,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cAt some point, in due course, he will make some determinations on that. We have not made decisions on a lot of these things.\u201d\nKudlow added:\nYou can\u2019t tell me that he isn\u2019t right when 100,000 people [a month] now are crossing the border illegally. You can\u2019t tell me something shouldn\u2019t be done. It\u2019s just common sense. It\u2019s an economic issue. It\u2019s a security issue. It\u2019s a drug trafficking issue. It\u2019s a kids trafficking issue. It\u2019s really insane. He will make the decision on that. It\u2019s not my call, it\u2019s his call.\n2. Why Would Trump Want to Release Illegal Immigrants Anywhere in U.S.?\nTrump doesn\u2019t want to release illegal border crossers, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement lacks detention space to hold them and there is a shortage of immigration judges to adjudicate deportation hearings and asylum claims.\nUnder federal law, if an illegal border crosser claims asylum, authorities cannot send him or her back into Mexico. The matter must be adjudicated through a hearing.\nThose who claim asylum have to submit to a \u201ccredible fear interview,\u201d while others face a deportation hearing before an immigration judge.\nIt can take eight years before such a hearing is held, and many illegal immigrants don\u2019t show up for a hearing or interview. These circumstances lead to the de facto policy of \u201ccatch and release\u201d\u2014with the release being inside the country.\n\u201cIdeally, we shouldn\u2019t be releasing illegal immigrants into the country at all, but as long as there is a shortage of judges and Congress won\u2019t approve additional detention space for ICE, the government does,\u201d Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, told The Daily Signal.\n\u201cTo the degree Congress won\u2019t act, we might as well release them on the steps of San Francisco City Hall,\u201d Mehlman said. \u201cIf you have to keep releasing people, you might as well release then in communities that say they want them.\u201d\nMehlman added: \u201cThis puts sanctuary cities to the test. Do you really want them, or are you just grandstanding?\u201d\n3. Would It Be Legal?\nThe New York Times reported five days ago that the idea got some pushback inside Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\u201cICE officials balked at the notion of moving migrants to detention facilities in different areas,\u201d the newspaper reported, \u201cinsisting that Congress only authorizes the agency to deport immigrants, not relocate them internally, according to DHS officials.\u201d\nHowever, Trump is bringing in new leadership for the Department of Homeland Security after forcing out Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on April 7.\nSince the Times and others reported on the legal questions, Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, a labor union, and former ICE acting Director Thomas Homan both have said the move would be legal.\nA former Justice Department lawyer, Hans von Spakovsky, said no specific provision of law prevents it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no restriction, there\u2019s no legal limit in federal immigration law that says the Department of Homeland Security can only release detained illegal aliens in particular locations,\u201d von Spakovsky, now a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, said Monday night on \u201cLou Dobbs Tonight\u201d on Fox Business Network.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything in the law that would prevent the president from doing this,\u201d he said.\nBut Democratic lawmakers contend the move would be illegal because funds were not authorized for this purpose.\n\u201cIf the administration wants to send a message to Democrats, let us send this message to the president: If your immigration policies are not fixing the problem but only cause chaos and focus on keeping people out, they will always fail,\u201d House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in a prepared statement. \u201cPlaying politics with the country\u2019s homeland security has been a mainstay of the Trump administration since day one. The American people want it to end.\u201d\nRegarding congressional Democrats\u2019 objections, von Spakovsky said on Fox Business Network, the lawmakers didn\u2019t say why it\u2019s illegal.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear them citing any particular statute or provision of federal immigration law, so I think they are just making that assertion really without any support,\u201d he said.\nTransporting illegal immigrants within the interior of the U.S. would not be a new policy, von Spakovsky added.\n\u201cLook, keep in mind, over the past many years, for example when unescorted minors have been caught at the border, the Department of Homeland Security has been transporting them all over the country to join other members of their families, guardians, and things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been happening for years.\u201d\nIf the appropriations process is the only legal question, that likely could be addressed, said Art Arthur, a former federal immigration judge who was general counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, now ICE.\n\u201cIllegal immigrants that are released are formally put on parole,\u201d Arthur told The Daily Signal.\nArthur, now a resident fellow for law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, said the law allows an immigration judge or the secretary of homeland security to place conditions on that parole.\n\u201cIn this case, they could be required to go to certain locations as a condition of parole, at no cost to the government,\u201d he said.\nIt would be at no cost because a judge could order an immigrant\u2014as a condition of parole\u2014to live in a certain location or risk being arrested.\nWith regard to local costs that follow relocation, sanctuary cities and counties already are magnets for illegal immigrants. The added costs of being a home to illegal immigrants falls disproportionately on a few communities near the border as well as inner-city Los Angeles and parts of Florida and North Carolina, Arthur said.\nTransporting wouldn\u2019t deter illegal border crossers, but it might apportion the problem more equally among jurisdictions.\nMehlman said the policy likely wouldn\u2019t have to be specifically budgeted by Congress because the government already transports illegal immigrants for various reasons.\n\u201cThis is not authorized in the budget specifically, but catch and release isn\u2019t authorized in the budget,\u201d Mehlman said. \u201cWe already pay for transporting unaccompanied minors to their nearest relatives.\u201d\n4. What\u2019s the Harm?\nBesides not solving any problems with illegal border crossings, the policy being considered by Trump could create new problems, Arthur warned.\nSanctuary jurisdictions, generally in heavily Democratic areas, usually encourage illegal immigrants to fill out census forms already, he said.\n\u201cYou have to consider the census,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cIncreasing the populations of sanctuary jurisdictions is just going to give them more political power, not less.\u201d\nSuch a policy also would move illegal immigrants to locations that make it harder for the federal government to track them, the former immigration judge said.\n\u201cThis puts ICE in a position to try to find people in sanctuary communities that already make it difficult for them,\u201d he said.\nLastly, Arthur said, even if the legal issues regarding authorizing funds are fully addressed, \u201cthe costs of busing people apprehended at the border for eight hours into San Francisco has real-world consequences.\u201d",

He was consequently sentenced to one month in prison followed by a supervised release for one year.\nEspinosa-Pena is a lawful permanent resident in Wake County, however, his application for United States citizenship had been denied. He had attempted to register to vote prior to the election but was initially denied since he was not a U.S. citizen.\nAn election official ultimately registered Espinosa-Pena and advised him that \u201cif he wanted his voice to be heard, he needed to vote,\u201d according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice.\nPresident Donald Trump won North Carolina\u2019s 15 electoral votes in the general election, defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by only 3.6%, or fewer than 200,000 votes. However, Clinton won Wake County by one of the largest margins in the state of North Carolina.\nIt is not clear which candidate Espinosa-Pena voted for during the 2016 election.\nThe probe into Espinosa-Pena was led by Homeland Security Investigations through the Document and Benefit Fraud Task Force. The department\u2019s investigation into voter fraud is still ongoing.\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

All but three Democrats in the Senate voted against Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse&rsquo;s Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would mandate doctors to provide medical care to babies born-alive after botched abortions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don&rsquo;t mind executing babies AFTER birth,&rdquo; President Trump tweeted. &ldquo;This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress. If there is one thing we should all agree on, it&rsquo;s protecting the lives of innocent babies.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote data-lang=\"en\"><p>&hellip;.This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress.

(It does.) And to muck up matters further, Wen curiously invoked her status as a mother of a one-year-old to underscore her outrage at Trump.</p>\n<p>For real.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As a mother to a one-year old, I am disgusted by [Donald Trump&rsquo;s] lies that aim to stoke fear and division. I know his true intention: to shame women, limit our access to health care, and take away our rights,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>\n<blockquote data-lang=\"en\"><p>As a mother to a one-year old, I am disgusted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RealDonaldTrump</a>&rsquo;s lies that aim to stoke fear and division.

There are botched abortions where babies survive, according to the Center for Disease Control. Moreover, undercover video footage has captured abortion workers talking about such instances. Live Action&rsquo;s Lila Rose highlighted this travesty in a statement issued Monday night:</p>\n<blockquote><em>&ldquo;Live Action has documented on camera how abortionists in our country&rsquo;s notorious late-term abortion facilities talk about survivors of abortion. Washington, D.C. abortionist Cesare Santangelo told our undercover investigators that he would make sure babies &lsquo;do not survive&rsquo; if they were born alive at his facility,&rdquo; said Rose. &ldquo;A New York abortion worker told our Live Action investigator to &lsquo;flush&rsquo; the baby down the toilet or &lsquo;put it in a bag&rsquo; if she&rsquo;s born alive. In Arizona, an abortion worker told us there &lsquo;may be movement&rsquo; after the baby is outside of the mother and that they would refuse to provide help and instead let her die. Dr. DeShawn Taylor, former medical director for Planned Parenthood, told a Center for Medical Progress investigator that identifying &lsquo;signs of life&rsquo; after a baby survives an abortion is contingent upon &lsquo;who&rsquo;s in the room.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></blockquote>\n<p>The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act amends the criminal code to &ldquo;prohibit a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If an abortion results in the live birth of an infant, the infant is a legal person for all purposes under the laws of the United States, and entitled to all the protections of such laws,&rdquo; the legislation states, adding: &ldquo;Any infant born alive after an abortion or within a hospital, clinic, or other facility has the same claim to the protection of the law that would arise for any newborn, or for any person who comes to a hospital, clinic, or other facility for screening and treatment or otherwise becomes a patient within its care.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Please Check Your\nNetwork Connection\nOn Monday night, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to voice his outrage after Senate Democrats effectively went on record as pro-infanticide. All but three Democrats in the Senate voted against Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse\u2019s Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would mandate doctors to provide medical care to babies born-alive after botched abortions.\n\u201cSenate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don\u2019t mind executing babies AFTER birth,\u201d President Trump tweeted. \u201cThis will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress. If there is one thing we should all agree on, it\u2019s protecting the lives of innocent babies.\u201d\n\u2026.This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress. If there is one thing we should all agree on, it\u2019s protecting the lives of innocent babies.\nPlanned Parenthood President Leana Wen was apparently \u201cdisgusted\u201d by President Trump\u2019s tweet, not that born-alive babies might be left to die, which according to Wen, doesn\u2019t happen. (It does.) And to muck up matters further, Wen curiously invoked her status as a mother of a one-year-old to underscore her outrage at Trump.\nFor real.\n\u201cAs a mother to a one-year old, I am disgusted by [Donald Trump\u2019s] lies that aim to stoke fear and division. I know his true intention: to shame women, limit our access to health care, and take away our rights,\u201d she wrote.\nAs a mother to a one-year old, I am disgusted by @RealDonaldTrump\u2019s lies that aim to stoke fear and division. I know his true intention: to shame women, limit our access to health care, and take away our rights. https://t.co/8JSgPKQmdk\n\u201cThe President of the United States is lying to the American people about the Sasse bill. What [Donald Trump] is saying has no basis in medicine\u2014or reality,\u201d Wen claimed in a follow-up tweet.\nThe President of the United States is lying to the American people about the Sasse bill. What @RealDonaldTrump is saying has no basis in medicine\u2014or reality.\nAs reported by The Daily Wire on Tuesday, this talking point is just not true. There are botched abortions where babies survive, according to the Center for Disease Control. Moreover, undercover video footage has captured abortion workers talking about such instances. Live Action\u2019s Lila Rose highlighted this travesty in a statement issued Monday night:\n\u201cLive Action has documented on camera how abortionists in our country\u2019s notorious late-term abortion facilities talk about survivors of abortion. Washington, D.C. abortionist Cesare Santangelo told our undercover investigators that he would make sure babies \u2018do not survive\u2019 if they were born alive at his facility,\u201d said Rose. \u201cA New York abortion worker told our Live Action investigator to \u2018flush\u2019 the baby down the toilet or \u2018put it in a bag\u2019 if she\u2019s born alive. In Arizona, an abortion worker told us there \u2018may be movement\u2019 after the baby is outside of the mother and that they would refuse to provide help and instead let her die. Dr. DeShawn Taylor, former medical director for Planned Parenthood, told a Center for Medical Progress investigator that identifying \u2018signs of life\u2019 after a baby survives an abortion is contingent upon \u2018who\u2019s in the room.\u2019\u201d\nThe Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act amends the criminal code to \u201cprohibit a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion.\u201d\n\u201cIf an abortion results in the live birth of an infant, the infant is a legal person for all purposes under the laws of the United States, and entitled to all the protections of such laws,\u201d the legislation states, adding: \u201cAny infant born alive after an abortion or within a hospital, clinic, or other facility has the same claim to the protection of the law that would arise for any newborn, or for any person who comes to a hospital, clinic, or other facility for screening and treatment or otherwise becomes a patient within its care.\u201d",

Josh Hawley (R-MO) decided to double down and push onward with his <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/43923/hammer-judicial-crisis-networks-open-attack-sen-josh-hammer\">previously flagged skepticism</a> of top Trump administration judicial nominee Neomi Rao.</p>\n<p>As The Daily Wire <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/43923/hammer-judicial-crisis-networks-open-attack-sen-josh-hammer\">noted</a> yesterday:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Rao is the current Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs &mdash; making her the Trump Administration&rsquo;s de facto &ldquo;regulatory czar&rdquo; &mdash; who is the White House&rsquo;s official nominee tapped to fill Justice Brett Kavanaugh&rsquo;s vacated seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit, due to its administrative law-heavy docket and its position in the nation&rsquo;s capital, is often considered to be the second most prestigious court in the country after the U.S. Supreme Court.

                "text": "Please Check Your\nNetwork Connection\nToday, freshman Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) decided to double down and push onward with his previously flagged skepticism of top Trump administration judicial nominee Neomi Rao.\nAs The Daily Wire noted yesterday:\nRao is the current Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \u2014 making her the Trump Administration\u2019s de facto \u201cregulatory czar\u201d \u2014 who is the White House\u2019s official nominee tapped to fill Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s vacated seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit, due to its administrative law-heavy docket and its position in the nation\u2019s capital, is often considered to be the second most prestigious court in the country after the U.S. Supreme Court. In addition to Kavanaugh, Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas, and the late Justice Antonin Scalia were all tapped to the Supreme Court from their respective perches on the D.C. Circuit.\nHawley\u2019s public skepticism of Rao, as The Daily Wire also noted, makes this a nasty internecine struggle on the legal Right. Hawley is himself a Yale Law School graduate, former Supreme Court clerk, constitutional law professor, and Missouri Attorney General \u2014 and he now finds himself at loggerheads with the conservative group, Judicial Crisis Network (JCN), and JCN\u2019s de facto bosses at the Federalist Society.\nToday, JCN has only doubled down in its opposition to Hawley\u2019s pronounced skepticism of Rao.\nQuin Hillyer: \u201cIt would be a terrible double standard to insist on a pro-life litmus test while denouncing a pro-choice one. But that, in effect, is what Hawley is doing, and on the basis of mere hearsay, at that.\u201d https://t.co/6hbJoK2Ci3 @dcexaminer\nBut Hawley himself has also doubled down.\nAs Politico and The New York Times report, Hawley\u2019s press office today released a letter that the freshman Missouri Senator has sent to Rao.

Hawley and Rao are set to meet on Wednesday.\nTonight, The Washington Post is confirming that Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) similarly harbors concerns about Rao:\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) is privately raising questions about Neomi Rao, President Trump\u2019s nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

George Miller, D-Calif., attempted a similar effort regarding a national emergency declared by then-President George W. Bush, but the measure never came to a vote on the House floor.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s bill passed the House by a vote of 245-182. All Democrats voted in favor of the bill and were joined by only 13 Republicans. For the bill to pass the Senate, enough Republicans would have to break party lines, prompting President Trump to issue his first veto that only a two-thirds super-majority could break. Three Republican senators have said they would support the legislation, which Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says will be up for a vote sometime in March. Even if the bill were to pass, House GOP Whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) said the Senate would not be able to override Trump&rsquo;s veto.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When you see the vote today, there will be nowhere near the votes to override a veto,&rdquo; Scalise said on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) condemned Trump&rsquo;s national emergency declaration as a move that would &ldquo;steal billions of dollars&rdquo; from the U.S. military to build the Mexico border wall. House Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer (D&ndash;MD) said Republicans are voting along party, not ideological, lines.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If Republicans vote their beliefs, we&rsquo;ll get a lot. If they vote their party, we won&rsquo;t get a lot,&rdquo; said Hoyer.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the president warned Republicans that his supporters and an overwhelming number of Americans support border security.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I hope our great Republican Senators don&rsquo;t get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,&rdquo; Trump tweeted. &ldquo;Without strong Borders, we don&rsquo;t have a Country &mdash; and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don&rsquo;t fall into the Democrats &lsquo;trap&rsquo; of Open Borders and Crime!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Supporters of the president say the national emergency declaration is an appropriate response given the magnitude of the problem.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I went down there neutral on this question, didn&rsquo;t know whether or not I&rsquo;d support a national emergency,&rdquo; said Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL). &ldquo;And, I came back more convinced than probably anybody that this is the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham said Democrats are not taking the border crisis seriously by treating it like a phantom menace cooked up by President Trump.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We had a great presentation from Vice President Pence and his team regarding the emergency declaration and the need for additional spending to protect our southern border,&rdquo; Graham told reporters this week. &ldquo;The Vice President made a compelling case that the border crisis is real and President Trump has both the authority and legal backing to declare a national emergency.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Graham added that Democrats were acting hypocritically on the issue, citing when President Obama declared a humanitarian crisis on the southern border in 2014.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In 2014, President Obama declared a humanitarian crisis at our southern border because 120,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended,&rdquo; Graham said. &ldquo;As of today, we have already apprehended 120,000 in Fiscal Year 2019. The problems of 2014 are only getting worse.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Please Check Your\nNetwork Connection\nHouse Democrats overwhelming passed legislation on Tuesday designed to block President Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration to build a wall on the southern border, Fox News reports.\n\u201cTuesday\u2019s vote marked the first time the House or Senate has tried to terminate a presidential declaration of a national emergency, using the provisions of the National Emergencies Act of 1976,\u201d reports the outlet. \u201cFormer Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., attempted a similar effort regarding a national emergency declared by then-President George W. Bush, but the measure never came to a vote on the House floor.\u201d\nTuesday\u2019s bill passed the House by a vote of 245-182. All Democrats voted in favor of the bill and were joined by only 13 Republicans. For the bill to pass the Senate, enough Republicans would have to break party lines, prompting President Trump to issue his first veto that only a two-thirds super-majority could break. Three Republican senators have said they would support the legislation, which Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says will be up for a vote sometime in March. Even if the bill were to pass, House GOP Whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) said the Senate would not be able to override Trump\u2019s veto.\n\u201cWhen you see the vote today, there will be nowhere near the votes to override a veto,\u201d Scalise said on Tuesday.\nHouse Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) condemned Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration as a move that would \u201csteal billions of dollars\u201d from the U.S. military to build the Mexico border wall. House Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer (D\u2013MD) said Republicans are voting along party, not ideological, lines.\n\u201cIf Republicans vote their beliefs, we\u2019ll get a lot. If they vote their party, we won\u2019t get a lot,\u201d said Hoyer.\nOn Monday, the president warned Republicans that his supporters and an overwhelming number of Americans support border security.\n\u201cI hope our great Republican Senators don\u2019t get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWithout strong Borders, we don\u2019t have a Country \u2014 and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don\u2019t fall into the Democrats \u2018trap\u2019 of Open Borders and Crime!\u201d\nSupporters of the president say the national emergency declaration is an appropriate response given the magnitude of the problem.\n\u201cI went down there neutral on this question, didn\u2019t know whether or not I\u2019d support a national emergency,\u201d said Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL). \u201cAnd, I came back more convinced than probably anybody that this is the right thing to do.\u201d\nSen. Lindsey Graham said Democrats are not taking the border crisis seriously by treating it like a phantom menace cooked up by President Trump.\n\u201cWe had a great presentation from Vice President Pence and his team regarding the emergency declaration and the need for additional spending to protect our southern border,\u201d Graham told reporters this week. \u201cThe Vice President made a compelling case that the border crisis is real and President Trump has both the authority and legal backing to declare a national emergency.\u201d\nGraham added that Democrats were acting hypocritically on the issue, citing when President Obama declared a humanitarian crisis on the southern border in 2014.\n\u201cIn 2014, President Obama declared a humanitarian crisis at our southern border because 120,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAs of today, we have already apprehended 120,000 in Fiscal Year 2019.

We will soon find out?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Trump is referencing a new poll that found that more Americans than ever now agree with Trump that the Mueller probe is a &ldquo;witch hunt.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A USA Today/Suffolk University Poll published Monday morning found that 50% of Americans now say &ldquo;they agree with Trump&rsquo;s assertion that the special counsel&rsquo;s investigation is a &lsquo;witch hunt&rsquo; and that he has been subjected to more investigations than previous presidents because of politics,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/18/trust-mueller-investigation-falls-half-americans-say-trump-victim-witch-hunt/3194049002/\">USA Today</a> reports. Nearly half, 47 percent, disagree with that assertion; only 3 percent don&rsquo;t have an opinion on the issue.</p>\n<p>The poll found &ldquo;a stark partisan divide on that question,&rdquo; with nearly all, 86%, of Republicans dismissing the investigation as a &ldquo;witch hunt,&rdquo; while the inverse, 14%, of Democrats agree. Independents are split, with 52% agreeing it&rsquo;s a witch hunt and 42% disagreeing.</p>\n<p>The poll also found the public souring on the idea of impeaching Trump, with support for impeachment dropping 10% to just 28% since October.</p>\n<p>As The Daily Wire&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/44809/tired-mueller-poll-says-americans-increasingly-emily-zanotti\">Emily Zanotti</a> noted in her coverage of the poll Monday, it comes &ldquo;just as Democrats are setting up their spring agenda in the House of Representatives, and announcing several brand new probes into the White House, the Trump Administration, and Trump companies who did business with the Russian government and wealthy Russian individuals even before Donald Trump ran for president.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, despite insiders indicating for weeks that the Mueller probe was on the verge of wrapping up, <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/mar/17/mueller-probe-pursues-russia-collusion-leads-but-i/\">new reports</a> suggest it might be pursuing new leads.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s rhetorical campaign against the &ldquo;witch hunt&rdquo; has been ramping up over recent weeks. Over the last few days, Trump has highlighted various reports revealing more details about the partisan origins of the Russian &ldquo;collusion&rdquo; narrative and subsequent investigation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;New evidence that the Obama era team of the FBI, DOJ &amp; CIA were working together to Spy on (and take out) President Trump, all the way back in 2015.&rsquo; A transcript of Peter Strzok&rsquo;s testimony is devastating. Hopefully the Mueller Report will be covering this,&rdquo; Trump tweeted Friday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So, if there was knowingly &amp; acknowledged to be &lsquo;zero&rsquo; crime when the Special Counsel was appointed, and if the appointment was made based on the Fake Dossier (paid for by Crooked Hillary) and now disgraced Andrew McCabe (he &amp; all stated no crime), then the Special Counsel should never have been appointed and there should be no Mueller Report,&rdquo; he said in follow-up tweets. &ldquo;This was an illegal &amp; conflicted investigation in search of a crime. Russian Collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the Democrats for losing an Election that they thought they were going to win&hellip;..THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A PRESIDENT AGAIN!&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Please Check Your\nNetwork Connection\nOn Monday morning, President Trump directed his 59 million followers\u2019 attention to a new poll that found that the American people are increasingly agreeing with him that Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation into Russian interference and potential \u201ccollusion\u201d with the Trump campaign is a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\u201cWow! A Suffolk/USA Today Poll, just out, states, \u201850% of Americans AGREE that Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation is a Witch Hunt.\u2019 @MSNBC,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cVery few think it is legit! We will soon find out?\u201d\nWow! A Suffolk/USA Today Poll, just out, states, \u201c50% of Americans AGREE that Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation is a Witch Hunt.\u201d @MSNBC Very few think it is legit! We will soon find out?\nTrump is referencing a new poll that found that more Americans than ever now agree with Trump that the Mueller probe is a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\nA USA Today/Suffolk University Poll published Monday morning found that 50% of Americans now say \u201cthey agree with Trump\u2019s assertion that the special counsel\u2019s investigation is a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 and that he has been subjected to more investigations than previous presidents because of politics,\u201d USA Today reports. Nearly half, 47 percent, disagree with that assertion; only 3 percent don\u2019t have an opinion on the issue.\nThe poll found \u201ca stark partisan divide on that question,\u201d with nearly all, 86%, of Republicans dismissing the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d while the inverse, 14%, of Democrats agree. Independents are split, with 52% agreeing it\u2019s a witch hunt and 42% disagreeing.\nThe poll also found the public souring on the idea of impeaching Trump, with support for impeachment dropping 10% to just 28% since October.\nAs The Daily Wire\u2019s Emily Zanotti noted in her coverage of the poll Monday, it comes \u201cjust as Democrats are setting up their spring agenda in the House of Representatives, and announcing several brand new probes into the White House, the Trump Administration, and Trump companies who did business with the Russian government and wealthy Russian individuals even before Donald Trump ran for president.\u201d\nMeanwhile, despite insiders indicating for weeks that the Mueller probe was on the verge of wrapping up, new reports suggest it might be pursuing new leads.\nTrump\u2019s rhetorical campaign against the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d has been ramping up over recent weeks. Over the last few days, Trump has highlighted various reports revealing more details about the partisan origins of the Russian \u201ccollusion\u201d narrative and subsequent investigation.\n\u201c\u2018New evidence that the Obama era team of the FBI, DOJ & CIA were working together to Spy on (and take out) President Trump, all the way back in 2015.\u2019 A transcript of Peter Strzok\u2019s testimony is devastating. Hopefully the Mueller Report will be covering this,\u201d Trump tweeted Friday.\n\u201cSo, if there was knowingly & acknowledged to be \u2018zero\u2019 crime when the Special Counsel was appointed, and if the appointment was made based on the Fake Dossier (paid for by Crooked Hillary) and now disgraced Andrew McCabe (he & all stated no crime), then the Special Counsel should never have been appointed and there should be no Mueller Report,\u201d he said in follow-up tweets. \u201cThis was an illegal & conflicted investigation in search of a crime. Russian Collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the Democrats for losing an Election that they thought they were going to win\u2026..THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A PRESIDENT AGAIN!\u201d",

You are a mixture of all different things. You are your own special creation. That&rsquo;s how I take it&mdash;I am not male or female. I think I float somewhere in between &mdash; it&rsquo;s all on the spectrum.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been very free in terms of thinking about my sexuality,&rdquo; added the singer, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ve just tried to change that into my thoughts on gender as well.&rdquo; Smith said he will &ldquo;think like a woman sometimes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As noted by Complex, the Grammy winner said he had liposuction at age 12 because of his large &ldquo;breasts&rdquo; and previously contemplated having a sex-change operation. Smith now says a sex-change operation is not for him.</p>\n<p>According to Entertainment Weekly, the musical talent has a preference for the male &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;him&rdquo; pronouns when being addressed, unlike some other &ldquo;nonbinary&rdquo; folks who opt for &ldquo;they&rdquo; and &ldquo;them&rdquo; pronouns, The Hill <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/434640-sam-smith-identifies-himself-as-gender-nonbinary\">reports</a>.</p>\n<p>Smith came out as a gay man to the public in 2014, and in 2017, the star <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/interview-sam-smith-on-coming-out-and-the-thrill-of-it-all-3235l3n78\">told</a> The Sunday Times that he feels &ldquo;just as much woman&rdquo; as he does &ldquo;a man.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I love a heel,&rdquo; Smith said, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sam-smith-on-feeling-just-as-much-woman-as-i-am-man-126638/\">according</a> to Rolling Stone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got loads of heels at home. &hellip; People don&rsquo;t know this, but when I was 17, I remember becoming obsessed with Boy George and Marilyn, and all that. There was one moment in my life where I didn&rsquo;t own a piece of male clothing, really. I would wear full make-up every day in school, eyelashes, leggings with Dr. Martens and huge fur coats &ndash; for two and a half years.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the title would be, but I feel just as much woman as I am man,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>Others in Hollywood have come out as &ldquo;nonbinary&rdquo; or &ldquo;genderfluid,&rdquo; too, in recent years.</p>\n<p>For example, pop-singer Miley Cyrus told Billboard in 2017 about her &ldquo;nonbinary&rdquo; tendencies. &ldquo;Miley told <em>Billboard</em> that she often thinks about her gender identity, saying that she doesn&rsquo;t really identify as a boy or a girl. While she said her looks vacillates between somewhat masculine and super femme, defying expectations for how girls are &lsquo;supposed&rsquo; to dress, Miley said her gender identity also exists outside the binary,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/miley-cyrus-gender-identity-smoking-weed\">reported</a> Teen Vogue.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think about being a girl all the time,&rdquo; said Cyrus. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always like, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s weird that I&rsquo;m a girl, because I just don&rsquo;t feel like a girl, and I don&rsquo;t feel like a boy.'&rdquo;</p>\n<p>WATCH:</p>\n<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BvCQLS4lF50/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\"><p>A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jameelajamilofficial/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading\"> Jameela Jamil</a> (@jameelajamilofficial) on Mar 15, 2019 at 9:11am PDT</p></blockquote>",

You are a mixture of all different things. You are your own special creation. That\u2019s how I take it\u2014I am not male or female. I think I float somewhere in between \u2014 it\u2019s all on the spectrum.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been very free in terms of thinking about my sexuality,\u201d added the singer, \u201cso I\u2019ve just tried to change that into my thoughts on gender as well.\u201d Smith said he will \u201cthink like a woman sometimes.\u201d\nAs noted by Complex, the Grammy winner said he had liposuction at age 12 because of his large \u201cbreasts\u201d and previously contemplated having a sex-change operation. Smith now says a sex-change operation is not for him.\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, the musical talent has a preference for the male \u201che\u201d and \u201chim\u201d pronouns when being addressed, unlike some other \u201cnonbinary\u201d folks who opt for \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d pronouns, The Hill reports.\nSmith came out as a gay man to the public in 2014, and in 2017, the star told The Sunday Times that he feels \u201cjust as much woman\u201d as he does \u201ca man.\u201d\n\u201cI love a heel,\u201d Smith said, according to Rolling Stone. \u201cI\u2019ve got loads of heels at home. \u2026 People don\u2019t know this, but when I was 17, I remember becoming obsessed with Boy George and Marilyn, and all that. There was one moment in my life where I didn\u2019t own a piece of male clothing, really. I would wear full make-up every day in school, eyelashes, leggings with Dr. Martens and huge fur coats \u2013 for two and a half years.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the title would be, but I feel just as much woman as I am man,\u201d he added.\nOthers in Hollywood have come out as \u201cnonbinary\u201d or \u201cgenderfluid,\u201d too, in recent years.\nFor example, pop-singer Miley Cyrus told Billboard in 2017 about her \u201cnonbinary\u201d tendencies. \u201cMiley told Billboard that she often thinks about her gender identity, saying that she doesn\u2019t really identify as a boy or a girl. While she said her looks vacillates between somewhat masculine and super femme, defying expectations for how girls are \u2018supposed\u2019 to dress, Miley said her gender identity also exists outside the binary,\u201d reported Teen Vogue.\n\u201cI think about being a girl all the time,\u201d said Cyrus. \u201cI\u2019m always like, \u2018It\u2019s weird that I\u2019m a girl, because I just don\u2019t feel like a girl, and I don\u2019t feel like a boy.'\u201d\nWATCH:\nA post shared by Jameela Jamil (@jameelajamilofficial) on Mar 15, 2019 at 9:11am PDT",

And, you know, this is something that we&rsquo;ve seen since President Trump came into office, called this network fake news, his referring to the press as the enemy of the people and so on is that this is a virus that is spreading around the world,&rdquo; Acosta said, according to a clip flagged by <a href=\"https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/curtis-houck/2019/03/19/meltdown-acosta-trump-spreading-virus-against-media-right-has\">NewsBusters</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When you have the President of Brazil calling the press fake news, he is &mdash; he is trying to essentially, you know, in a sycophantic sort of way, suck up to the President of the United States,&rdquo; Acosta continued. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other way of putting it and trying to emulate him down, as they call him in Brazil, as the Trump of the tropics. You know, this is &mdash; this is another example of when the President of the United States says something here in the U.S. referring to the press as fake news, referring to the press in other derogatory terms, other leaders around the world, other governments around the world are listening and Jair Bolsonaro proved that to all of us here in this Rose Garden news conference, Brooke.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Acosta, who had his press credentials suspended last year for making contact with a White House aide during a news conference, &ldquo;was confronted by angel moms last month after he challenged Trump over what he described as a &lsquo;disconnect&rsquo; in his description of illegal immigration,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cnns-jim-acosta-complains-about-rose-garden-press-conference-after-not-getting-called-on\">Fox News</a>&lsquo; Brian Flood reported.</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro, who is a right-wing populist, praised Trump after he <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/19/brazils-jair-bolsonaro-trump-tropics-visits-donald-trump/3206386002/\">described</a> past administrations as being &ldquo;anti-U.S.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Later on in the news conference, he talked about this conservative grievance that they&rsquo;re being discriminated against in social media,&rdquo; Acosta continued. &ldquo;The president has, you know, a gazillion Twitter followers. He has a massive presence on Instagram, has a massive presence on Fakebook &mdash; Facebook. So do lots of other conservative figures here in the U.S. and so, you know, the president &mdash; he likes to talk about how there&rsquo;s this media collusion game that is stacked against him when he has one of the most powerful social media voices throughout. And so I think that just has to be said as well, it has to be put on the record that he is sort of, you know, pulling a three card monty in terms of, you know, how he&rsquo;s describing the situation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Conservatives aren&rsquo;t being discriminated and abused on social media,&rdquo; Acosta claimed. &ldquo;They have just as much of a landscape that they dominate as the left does and &mdash; and one could argue that they have a much bigger footprint when it comes to social media and the media landscape by and large, Brooke.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>WATCH:</p>",

And, you know, this is something that we\u2019ve seen since President Trump came into office, called this network fake news, his referring to the press as the enemy of the people and so on is that this is a virus that is spreading around the world,\u201d Acosta said, according to a clip flagged by NewsBusters.\n\u201cWhen you have the President of Brazil calling the press fake news, he is \u2014 he is trying to essentially, you know, in a sycophantic sort of way, suck up to the President of the United States,\u201d Acosta continued. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way of putting it and trying to emulate him down, as they call him in Brazil, as the Trump of the tropics. You know, this is \u2014 this is another example of when the President of the United States says something here in the U.S. referring to the press as fake news, referring to the press in other derogatory terms, other leaders around the world, other governments around the world are listening and Jair Bolsonaro proved that to all of us here in this Rose Garden news conference, Brooke.\u201d\nAcosta, who had his press credentials suspended last year for making contact with a White House aide during a news conference, \u201cwas confronted by angel moms last month after he challenged Trump over what he described as a \u2018disconnect\u2019 in his description of illegal immigration,\u201d Fox News\u2018 Brian Flood reported.\nBolsonaro, who is a right-wing populist, praised Trump after he described past administrations as being \u201canti-U.S.\u201d\n\u201cLater on in the news conference, he talked about this conservative grievance that they\u2019re being discriminated against in social media,\u201d Acosta continued. \u201cThe president has, you know, a gazillion Twitter followers. He has a massive presence on Instagram, has a massive presence on Fakebook \u2014 Facebook. So do lots of other conservative figures here in the U.S. and so, you know, the president \u2014 he likes to talk about how there\u2019s this media collusion game that is stacked against him when he has one of the most powerful social media voices throughout. And so I think that just has to be said as well, it has to be put on the record that he is sort of, you know, pulling a three card monty in terms of, you know, how he\u2019s describing the situation.\u201d\n\u201cConservatives aren\u2019t being discriminated and abused on social media,\u201d Acosta claimed. \u201cThey have just as much of a landscape that they dominate as the left does and \u2014 and one could argue that they have a much bigger footprint when it comes to social media and the media landscape by and large, Brooke.\u201d\nWATCH:",

LGBTQ leaders and feminists have also put forward the idea of stating preferred pronouns on email signatures.</p>\n<p>However, while Scientific American appreciates these gestures of &ldquo;gender inclusion,&rdquo; the publication feels it does not go far enough because they &ldquo;leave intact the presumption that gender identity is relevant in all social interactions,&rdquo; which the publication claims creates a problem, most especially for women. Scientific American cites several studies to underline its point, such as women with feminine names on their resumes being less likely to earn a job. Their solution: &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;they.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The universal singular <em>they</em> is inclusive of people who identify as male, female or nonbinary (e.g., &ldquo;Drew is in my class; they are a great student&rdquo;). It avoids the problem of misgendering by not using pronouns to gender people in the first place,&rdquo; the article said. &ldquo;Plus, it reduces the salience of gender in everyday interactions, which is likely to be a good thing for women.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In response to those who would dismiss the proposition as &ldquo;pie-in-the-sky thinking,&rdquo; the article dares to argue that the change in pronouns could be the same revolution as the word Ms. in the 1960&rsquo;s. The problem with that analogy, however, is that Ms. was an outflow of the French terms &ldquo;Madame&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mademoiselle&rdquo; &mdash; a woman and a girl. It was not so much a revolution as an adoption of what already existed.</p>\n<p>The Scientific American article does not even address how this will be socially enforced, which may be through the shame and hectoring of more traditionally-minded people as backward-thinking bigots who wish to oppress women. In fact, by characterizing the use of traditional pronouns as oppressive, Scientific American has already laid the groundwork for that social reality, which has already arrived in some quarters.</p>\n<p>Twitter, for instance, recently updated its &ldquo;hateful conduct policy&rdquo; to include &ldquo;misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals.&rdquo; Also, the website IMDB was <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/46011/deadnaming-trans-actors-blast-imdb-publishing-paul-bois\">recently heckled</a> by LGBT activists for allowing trans actors birth names to be included in their bios.</p>",

                "text": "Please Check Your\nNetwork Connection\nScientific American has proposed the rather unscientific idea of calling people by \u201cgenderless\u201d pronouns like \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d\nIn an article written last week, the publication highlighted a new virtual assistant named \u201cQ\u201d that has been assigned no gender, which should serve as a guideline for how people should now refer to each other from here on out.\n\u201cWhereas Siri, Alexa and most other electronic helpers speak in conspicuously feminine tones, Q has been engineered to create a gender-neutral effect,\u201d says the article. \u201cAs a result, users can benefit from all the useful information and guidance available to us today, without reinforcing the old-fashioned idea that the role of eager helpmate is necessarily played by a woman.\u201d\nThe article goes on to note the many cultural shifts already happening that will eventually pave the way to everyone referring to another as a \u201cthey,\u201d a \u201cthem,\u201d or an \u201cit.\u201d United Airlines recently announced, for instance, a new booking option that will permit people to say Mx in place of Mr. or Mrs. Professional settings have also begun business meetings in which people introduce themselves by stating their preferred pronouns. LGBTQ leaders and feminists have also put forward the idea of stating preferred pronouns on email signatures.\nHowever, while Scientific American appreciates these gestures of \u201cgender inclusion,\u201d the publication feels it does not go far enough because they \u201cleave intact the presumption that gender identity is relevant in all social interactions,\u201d which the publication claims creates a problem, most especially for women. Scientific American cites several studies to underline its point, such as women with feminine names on their resumes being less likely to earn a job. Their solution: \u201cthem\u201d and \u201cthey.\u201d\n\u201cThe universal singular they is inclusive of people who identify as male, female or nonbinary (e.g., \u201cDrew is in my class; they are a great student\u201d). It avoids the problem of misgendering by not using pronouns to gender people in the first place,\u201d the article said. \u201cPlus, it reduces the salience of gender in everyday interactions, which is likely to be a good thing for women.\u201d\nIn response to those who would dismiss the proposition as \u201cpie-in-the-sky thinking,\u201d the article dares to argue that the change in pronouns could be the same revolution as the word Ms. in the 1960\u2019s. The problem with that analogy, however, is that Ms. was an outflow of the French terms \u201cMadame\u201d and \u201cMademoiselle\u201d \u2014 a woman and a girl. It was not so much a revolution as an adoption of what already existed.\nThe Scientific American article does not even address how this will be socially enforced, which may be through the shame and hectoring of more traditionally-minded people as backward-thinking bigots who wish to oppress women. In fact, by characterizing the use of traditional pronouns as oppressive, Scientific American has already laid the groundwork for that social reality, which has already arrived in some quarters.\nTwitter, for instance, recently updated its \u201chateful conduct policy\u201d to include \u201cmisgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals.\u201d Also, the website IMDB was recently heckled by LGBT activists for allowing trans actors birth names to be included in their bios.",

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) may not have Hillary Clinton to contend with in this Democratic nomination process, but he&rsquo;s not about to let Clinton allies who are still active in the Democratic Party jump on the bandwagon of his success.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/online/bernie-sanders-writes-complaint-letter-because-thinkprogress-criticized-him-for-being-a-millionaire/\">Mediaite reports</a>, Sanders&rsquo; campaign &ldquo;fired off an angry letter to [the] liberal think tank&rdquo; Center for American Progress, now run by a longtime Clinton fan, Neera Tanden. The letter excoriated the Center for American Progress and it&rsquo;s 501(c)(4) offshoot, CAP Action Fund, for allowing an affiliated website, Think Progress, to attack Sanders for his &ldquo;appearance&rdquo; and for having earned more than a million dollars per year in 2017 and 2018, in part because of a bestselling book.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Last week,&rdquo; Bernie and his team fumed, &ldquo;you published an article on ThinkProgress criticizing me for my appearance and for the income I earned from writing a book. Then, a day later, you published a video that dishonestly attacked me for hypocrisy in my effort to address income inequality in America &ndash; a video that was excitedly discussed on many conservative websites.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As Mediaite notes, the piece doesn&rsquo;t exactly call Sanders a hypocrite, though he&rsquo;s responded with a temper tantrum nearly every time he&rsquo;s asked about his newfound wealth, but it does point out that Sanders, once a millionaire, quickly went from decrying the greed of &ldquo;millionaires&rdquo; and &ldquo;billionaires&rdquo; to decrying the greed of &ldquo;multi-millionaires&rdquo; and &ldquo;billionaires,&rdquo; conveniently exempting himself from his own criticism.</p>\n<p>The author also pointed out that it seems Sanders feels his wealth is &ldquo;very off-brand and embarrassing,&rdquo; and that he and his campaign have taken pains to hide his status not just as a millionaire, but as the owner of three houses and other trappings of wealth, even though Sanders defends his own riches by saying he still supports a &ldquo;progressive tax system which demands that the wealthiest people in this country finally start paying their fair share in taxes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In his letter, Sanders called out Tanden specifically &mdash; one of Clinton&rsquo;s top staffers on her 2008 campaign &mdash; for &ldquo;maligning my staff and supporters and belittling progressive ideas.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Center for American Progress is, of course, no conservative outlet and neither is Think Progress. To suggest that either group is even close to the <em>middle</em> is downright outrageous. It&rsquo;s also not directly affiliated with Think Progress, CAP claims, which they consider an &ldquo;editorially independent&rdquo; outlet under the umbrella of the 501(c)(4) but not directly related to it.</p>\n<p>Center for American Progress is a generous donor to both progressive and moderate Democratic campaigns as well as to left-leaning PACs and organizations. They&rsquo;re not a particularly good enemy to have, either, since they control a <a href=\"https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/center-for-american-progress-cap/\">large donor and influencer network</a> that includes billionaire George Soros, the powerful Tides Foundation, and the always-flush-with-cash Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They partner with no less than the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations.</p>\n<p>CAP also has direct links to the Podesta group, founded by John Podesta, a longtime Hillary Clinton ally and her 2016 campaign director.</p>\n<p>So why is Bernie so desperate to earn their ire? It&rsquo;s possible that Bernie is sore about an article and that he&rsquo;s particularly vulnerable to attacks on his wealth coming from the Left. But more likely, Bernie Sanders&rsquo; war with former Clinton allies is strategic. He did well, in 2016 and after, reminding his core followers that they were hated by &ldquo;Establishment Democrats,&rdquo; and who better to represent that bogeyman in the 2020 contest than an organization led by recognizable Clinton-era names?</p>\n<p>It keeps the wounds of 2016 fresh.</p>\n<p>It seems to be working. In the last week, Sanders has gone from second place to first in the Emerson presidential poll, and he&rsquo;s the only candidate on the trail drawing significant crowds in early primary states. If he and his staff successfully reframe his candidacy as anti-Establishment (even though he&rsquo;s been in the Senate several decades), it could propel him to the nomination.</p>",

                "text": "Please Check Your\nNetwork Connection\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) may not have Hillary Clinton to contend with in this Democratic nomination process, but he\u2019s not about to let Clinton allies who are still active in the Democratic Party jump on the bandwagon of his success.\nOver the weekend, Mediaite reports, Sanders\u2019 campaign \u201cfired off an angry letter to [the] liberal think tank\u201d Center for American Progress, now run by a longtime Clinton fan, Neera Tanden. The letter excoriated the Center for American Progress and it\u2019s 501(c)(4) offshoot, CAP Action Fund, for allowing an affiliated website, Think Progress, to attack Sanders for his \u201cappearance\u201d and for having earned more than a million dollars per year in 2017 and 2018, in part because of a bestselling book.\n\u201cLast week,\u201d Bernie and his team fumed, \u201cyou published an article on ThinkProgress criticizing me for my appearance and for the income I earned from writing a book. Then, a day later, you published a video that dishonestly attacked me for hypocrisy in my effort to address income inequality in America \u2013 a video that was excitedly discussed on many conservative websites.\u201d\nAs Mediaite notes, the piece doesn\u2019t exactly call Sanders a hypocrite, though he\u2019s responded with a temper tantrum nearly every time he\u2019s asked about his newfound wealth, but it does point out that Sanders, once a millionaire, quickly went from decrying the greed of \u201cmillionaires\u201d and \u201cbillionaires\u201d to decrying the greed of \u201cmulti-millionaires\u201d and \u201cbillionaires,\u201d conveniently exempting himself from his own criticism.\nThe author also pointed out that it seems Sanders feels his wealth is \u201cvery off-brand and embarrassing,\u201d and that he and his campaign have taken pains to hide his status not just as a millionaire, but as the owner of three houses and other trappings of wealth, even though Sanders defends his own riches by saying he still supports a \u201cprogressive tax system which demands that the wealthiest people in this country finally start paying their fair share in taxes.\u201d\nIn his letter, Sanders called out Tanden specifically \u2014 one of Clinton\u2019s top staffers on her 2008 campaign \u2014 for \u201cmaligning my staff and supporters and belittling progressive ideas.\u201d\nCenter for American Progress is, of course, no conservative outlet and neither is Think Progress. To suggest that either group is even close to the middle is downright outrageous. It\u2019s also not directly affiliated with Think Progress, CAP claims, which they consider an \u201ceditorially independent\u201d outlet under the umbrella of the 501(c)(4) but not directly related to it.\nCenter for American Progress is a generous donor to both progressive and moderate Democratic campaigns as well as to left-leaning PACs and organizations. They\u2019re not a particularly good enemy to have, either, since they control a large donor and influencer network that includes billionaire George Soros, the powerful Tides Foundation, and the always-flush-with-cash Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They partner with no less than the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations.\nCAP also has direct links to the Podesta group, founded by John Podesta, a longtime Hillary Clinton ally and her 2016 campaign director.\nSo why is Bernie so desperate to earn their ire? It\u2019s possible that Bernie is sore about an article and that he\u2019s particularly vulnerable to attacks on his wealth coming from the Left. But more likely, Bernie Sanders\u2019 war with former Clinton allies is strategic. He did well, in 2016 and after, reminding his core followers that they were hated by \u201cEstablishment Democrats,\u201d and who better to represent that bogeyman in the 2020 contest than an organization led by recognizable Clinton-era names?\nIt keeps the wounds of 2016 fresh.\nIt seems to be working. In the last week, Sanders has gone from second place to first in the Emerson presidential poll, and he\u2019s the only candidate on the trail drawing significant crowds in early primary states. If he and his staff successfully reframe his candidacy as anti-Establishment (even though he\u2019s been in the Senate several decades), it could propel him to the nomination.",

Steve Cohen (D-TN) has chosen the worst possible one: the Trump presidency &ldquo;torching the entire structure of government.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Speaking with Chris Matthews on MSNBC, Cohen cited the president&rsquo;s alleged obstruction of justice as evidence of his erosion to the American government.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I filed articles last year. I haven&rsquo;t brought them up this year, but we are getting so far along in seeing what this president has done and what he&rsquo;s done to the Constitution, what he&rsquo;s done to the people&rsquo;s respect for our government,&rdquo; Cohen said. &ldquo;What he has done to the Constitution and the rule of law is as bad as that fire did to Notre Dame.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s torching the entire structure of government and the people&rsquo;s respect for it and the Congress needs to act,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;The facts were supposed to be in the Mueller Report.

Ian Milihiser, a columnist for ThinkProgress, made a veiled reference when he likened the smoldering fire to &ldquo;Democracy in 2019.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The fact that a human achievement that took a century to build can be burnt away in a few hours is such a horrible metaphor for democracy in 2019,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<blockquote data-lang=\"en\"><p>The fact that a human achievement that took a century to build can be burnt away in a few hours is such a horrible metaphor for democracy in 2019.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fortunately, few Democrats used the horrible tragedy as a means to bash Trump, with most offering condolences to France for what it lost.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For centuries, Notre Dame Cathedral has withstood wars, revolutions, and the test of time.

Steve Cohen (D-TN) has chosen the worst possible one: the Trump presidency \u201ctorching the entire structure of government.\u201d\nSpeaking with Chris Matthews on MSNBC, Cohen cited the president\u2019s alleged obstruction of justice as evidence of his erosion to the American government.\n\u201cI filed articles last year. I haven\u2019t brought them up this year, but we are getting so far along in seeing what this president has done and what he\u2019s done to the Constitution, what he\u2019s done to the people\u2019s respect for our government,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWhat he has done to the Constitution and the rule of law is as bad as that fire did to Notre Dame.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s torching the entire structure of government and the people\u2019s respect for it and the Congress needs to act,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe facts were supposed to be in the Mueller Report. We\u2019ll get them.\u201d\nSteve Cohen was not the only one to see the Notre Dame fire as analogous to Trump. Ian Milihiser, a columnist for ThinkProgress, made a veiled reference when he likened the smoldering fire to \u201cDemocracy in 2019.\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that a human achievement that took a century to build can be burnt away in a few hours is such a horrible metaphor for democracy in 2019,\u201d he said.\nThe fact that a human achievement that took a century to build can be burnt away in a few hours is such a horrible metaphor for democracy in 2019.\nFortunately, few Democrats used the horrible tragedy as a means to bash Trump, with most offering condolences to France for what it lost.\n\u201cFor centuries, Notre Dame Cathedral has withstood wars, revolutions, and the test of time. It is a symbol of faith & a testament to history,\u201d tweeted former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cAnd even as our hearts break to see it burn today during the holiest week of the year for Catholics, I have faith that it will rise again.\u201d\nFor centuries, Notre Dame Cathedral has withstood wars, revolutions, and the test of time.

Dreadful to see such destruction at one of the world\u2019s most wondrous places.\n\u201cWatching the Notre-Dame Cathedral burning on Easter week. A tragedy for Paris, the Church and the world. 700 years of history. Such a sacred and beautiful place,\u201d said Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\nWatching the Notre-Dame Cathedral burning on Easter week.

Notre Dame is a symbol of our ability as human beings to unite for a higher purpose\u2014to build breathtaking spaces for worship that no one person could have built on their own,\u201d said Hillary Clinton. \u201cI wish France strength and shared purpose as they grieve and rebuild.\u201d\nPresident Trump hailed Notre Dame in the wake of the fire as being \u201cgreater than almost any museum in the world.\u201d\nFor a moment, if only brief, the tragedy brought people together in mourning of what Pope Francis referred to as an \u201carchitectural jewel of a collective memory.\u201d",

Notre Dame is, indeed, a monument to the civilization &mdash; the <em>Western</em> civilization &mdash; that built it over the course of several hundred years. It is not simply a work of art and architecture, but a monument to Christianity, and specifically Catholicism. It is a place of worship that houses one of France&rsquo;s largest collection of holy relics and religiously-inspired art and sculpture.</p>\n<p>As for the term &ldquo;Judeo-Christian,&rdquo; Lavin, who prides herself on her knowledge of white supremacist terminology (an accolade she, of course, bestowed on herself), believes Shapiro means to deliberately exclude &ldquo;Islam&rdquo; from the equation, putting Muslims on the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; of the culture that built Notre Dame. But the term &ldquo;Judeo-Christian&rdquo; means nothing of the sort; it refers directly to the ongoing, interconnected history of Judaism and Christianity, which share not just a common ancestry, but an ethics and values system that specifically incorporates the natural law as defined in the first several books of the Bible.</p>\n<p>Notre Dame, being a <em>church</em>, again, is a product of Judeo-Christian culture and heritage.</p>\n<p>Shapiro quickly shot back at Lavin&rsquo;s spurious accusations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This, from @chick_in_kiev, in The Washington Post, is the sheerest form of disgusting bulls***. I blamed no one for the Notre Dame fire, since it was an accident by all available evidence, and imputing malicious intent to me is simply gross,&rdquo; he tweeted.</p>\n<blockquote data-lang=\"en\"><p>This, from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chick_in_kiev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@chick_in_kiev</a>, in The Washington Post, is the sheerest form of disgusting bulls***.

She has thoughts, it seems, on how to solve this &ldquo;problem&rdquo; of &ldquo;inciting&rdquo; violence through speech: de-platform anyone she finds objectionable, including Shapiro.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It should not take the imprecations of journalists to restrain this dangerous flow of misinformation,&rdquo; she writes. &ldquo;It is past time that those who stoke inflammatory rhetoric, knowing its potential to catalyze racist violence, were made to stop playing with fire &ndash; before it&rsquo;s too late to control the inferno.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lavin has experience with stoking inflammatory rhetoric and imputing malicious intent. She, the &ldquo;expert&rdquo; on far-right extremists, is perhaps most famous for turning all of left-leaning Twitter against an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement analyst &mdash; and veteran of the war in Afghanistan who lost two legs to an IED attack &mdash; whom <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/31995/leftists-claim-wounded-vet-working-ice-has-nazi-hank-berrien\">she mis-identified as a neo-Nazi</a> based on an elbow tattoo she thought was a Nazi &ldquo;Iron Cross.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It was not an Iron Cross. It was a simple cross &mdash; the symbol of his Marine platoon in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>She and her then-employer, The New Yorker, promptly parted ways. She was picked up a month later as a researcher on far-right extremism for the left-leaning &ldquo;media watchdog&rdquo; site Media Matters. She has since left that job, as well, and will, instead, be teaching &mdash; what else? &mdash; how to identify and research members of the &ldquo;far right&rdquo; to the next generation of ideological journalists as a guest instructor at New York University.</p>",

Notre Dame is, indeed, a monument to the civilization \u2014 the Western civilization \u2014 that built it over the course of several hundred years. It is not simply a work of art and architecture, but a monument to Christianity, and specifically Catholicism. It is a place of worship that houses one of France\u2019s largest collection of holy relics and religiously-inspired art and sculpture.\nAs for the term \u201cJudeo-Christian,\u201d Lavin, who prides herself on her knowledge of white supremacist terminology (an accolade she, of course, bestowed on herself), believes Shapiro means to deliberately exclude \u201cIslam\u201d from the equation, putting Muslims on the \u201coutside\u201d of the culture that built Notre Dame. But the term \u201cJudeo-Christian\u201d means nothing of the sort; it refers directly to the ongoing, interconnected history of Judaism and Christianity, which share not just a common ancestry, but an ethics and values system that specifically incorporates the natural law as defined in the first several books of the Bible.\nNotre Dame, being a church, again, is a product of Judeo-Christian culture and heritage.\nShapiro quickly shot back at Lavin\u2019s spurious accusations.\n\u201cThis, from @chick_in_kiev, in The Washington Post, is the sheerest form of disgusting bulls***. I blamed no one for the Notre Dame fire, since it was an accident by all available evidence, and imputing malicious intent to me is simply gross,\u201d he tweeted.\nThis, from @chick_in_kiev, in The Washington Post, is the sheerest form of disgusting bulls***. I blamed no one for the Notre Dame fire, since it was an accident by all available evidence, and imputing malicious intent to me is simply gross. https://t.co/e5gvQqQc2G pic.twitter.com/T98E2JWJXe\nA number of others, from across the political spectrum, rushed to his defense.\nThis is INSANELY dishonest and irresponsible and wapo should fix it now and prevent it in the future https://t.co/19qccBRFIZ\nThis does, indeed, seem like a very unfair characterization of Ben\u2019s tweets, as someone who was watching @tweetertation question whether \u201cJudeo-Christian\u201d was inapt. https://t.co/LgzlD194oL\nNotre Dame is a monument to Western civilization! How is saying so anti-Islamic incitement or \u201cfar-right\u201d?\nEnough of this semi-literate nitwittery! Is Fred Hiatt editing WaPo opinions or some third-rate Edward Said wannabe at Fresno State? https://t.co/0BaRGRTk7h\n.@benshapiro and I disagree on Trump. We have from day one.\nBut to claim that Ben hasn\u2019t been an unwavering supporter of Christianity and Conservatism is just dishonest and dumb.\nStop the pearl clutching over an ill timed joke for which he apologized.\nBut Lavin, of course, didn\u2019t stop there. She has thoughts, it seems, on how to solve this \u201cproblem\u201d of \u201cinciting\u201d violence through speech: de-platform anyone she finds objectionable, including Shapiro.\n\u201cIt should not take the imprecations of journalists to restrain this dangerous flow of misinformation,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is past time that those who stoke inflammatory rhetoric, knowing its potential to catalyze racist violence, were made to stop playing with fire \u2013 before it\u2019s too late to control the inferno.\u201d\nLavin has experience with stoking inflammatory rhetoric and imputing malicious intent. She, the \u201cexpert\u201d on far-right extremists, is perhaps most famous for turning all of left-leaning Twitter against an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement analyst \u2014 and veteran of the war in Afghanistan who lost two legs to an IED attack \u2014 whom she mis-identified as a neo-Nazi based on an elbow tattoo she thought was a Nazi \u201cIron Cross.\u201d\nIt was not an Iron Cross. It was a simple cross \u2014 the symbol of his Marine platoon in Afghanistan.\nShe and her then-employer, The New Yorker, promptly parted ways. She was picked up a month later as a researcher on far-right extremism for the left-leaning \u201cmedia watchdog\u201d site Media Matters. She has since left that job, as well, and will, instead, be teaching \u2014 what else? \u2014 how to identify and research members of the \u201cfar right\u201d to the next generation of ideological journalists as a guest instructor at New York University.",

Spencer is a notorious &ldquo;alt-right&rdquo; Jew-hating provocateur, and Shapiro was the <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/press-center/CR_4862_Journalism-Task-Force_v2.pdf\">single most targeted journalist</a> during the 2016 election precisely due, in part, to his consistently staunch criticisms of the anti-Semitic &ldquo;alt-right.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This, from [Talia Lavin] in The Washington Post, is the sheerest form of disgusting bulls***,&rdquo; Shapiro tweeted. &ldquo;I blamed no one for the Notre Dame fire, since it was an accident by all available evidence, and imputing malicious intent to me is simply gross.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Alas, &ldquo;watchdog&rdquo; left-wing, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/ap-cites-partisan-media-matters-study-to-defend-aocs-honor\">pro-Clinton</a> activist group Media Matters for America (MMFA) then saw fit to chime in. And what a doozy it was.</p>\n<p>In an astonishing reply tweet that has somehow still not been deleted, MMFA replied back to Shapiro with, &ldquo;F*** you and the burro you rode in on.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Shapiro, screen-shotting the MMFA tweet in case the left-wing activist group subsequently deletes it, snarkily replied on his own: &ldquo;I very much look forward to the media continuing to quote this garbage smear organization as a &lsquo;media watchdog&rsquo; in every &lsquo;objective&rsquo; news article.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Shapiro is no stranger to MMFA, having written a Daily Wire <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/44509/media-matters-makes-america-worse-place-one-bad-ben-shapiro\">piece</a> just last month entitled, &ldquo;Media Matters Makes America A Worse Place, One Bad Faith Hit At A Time&rdquo;:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This was, from the first, an obvious political hit. Media Matters, contrary to media descriptions, isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;media watchdog organization.&rdquo; It is a political smear factory designed to perform precisely that function against anyone to the right of Hillary Clinton. The organization was founded by professional smear artist David Brock, in conjunction with the Center for American Progress, an organization itself founded by John Podesta, the Clinton White House Chief of Staff. Hillary Clinton herself advised Brock on the creation of the organization. Mega-donor Leftist George Soros has poured money into the organization, announcing in 2010, &ldquo;Media Matters is one of the few groups that attempts to hold Fox News accountable for the false and misleading information they so often broadcast. I am supporting Media Matters in an effort to more widely publicize the challenge Fox News poses to civil and informed discourse in our democracy.&rdquo; Media Matters had regular strategy calls with the Obama White House.</p><p>For years, Media Matters has operated as an aggressive wing of Clintonworld, going so far as to suggest hiring private investigators to dig up dirt on Fox News hosts. Media Matters consistently attempts to tear down conservative hosts by either ripping them out of context or by digging up old Bad Things&trade;, then astroturfing public pressure against advertisers. In reality, no real grassroots pressure exists in the vast majority of cases; the data show that secondary boycotts actually don&rsquo;t materialize. But Media Matters simply contacts its list of activists, then has them contact advertisers, saying that they&rsquo;ll stop using a product if that advertiser doesn&rsquo;t pull its advertising. A few tweets or well-placed phone calls can knock an advertiser off a show. This last tactic, the launching of secondary boycotts, has been successfully used against advertisers across a broad range of conservative programming; advertisers are, understandably, risk averse, and so take any sign of discontent as a rationale for pulling their money. This leads, eventually, to the complete abandonment of advertisers support on political shows &mdash; at least from the right.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Alas, even after MMFA savagely and grotesquely goes after a prominent conservative commentator in defense of an indefensibly defamatory Washington Post screed, do not get your hopes up for the mainstream media to start treating MMFA like the left-wing militant aggressor that it is.</p>",

                "text": "Please Check Your\nNetwork Connection\nAs The Daily Wire\u2019s Emily Zanotti reported earlier this evening, The Washington Post allowed Talia Lavin, a \u201cguest instructor\u201d at New York University\u2019s journalism program, to scurrilously tar and feather Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro over his alleged imaginary stoking of racial flames against Muslims in the aftermath of the horrific burning of Paris\u2019 iconic Notre Dame Cathedral.\nAs Zanotti reported:\nLavin, a \u201cguest instructor\u201d for New York University\u2019s journalism program, made her ridiculous claims in the storied Washington Post, which published her op-ed entitled, \u201cHow the far right spread politically convenient lies about the Notre Dame fire.\u201d In it, she alleges, without regard to the political position of the commentator or the real meaning of their words, that just as the first flames were licking the roof of Notre Dame, conservative writers set about to pushing conspiracy theories on how the fire started, apparently in the hopes of inciting violence against Muslims.\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear how Lavin came to her conclusions \u2026 but she does know, it seems, that writers and commentators share an affinity for \u201cdark conclusions,\u201d and that Ben Shapiro, whom she refers to as a \u201cfast-talking far-right pundit,\u201d is among the leaders of the movement.\nShapiro, she claims, blew a dog-whistle for anti-Muslim violence when he commented that Notre Dame was a \u201cmonument to Western civilization\u201d and \u201cJudeo-Christian heritage.\u201d To drive her point home, she juxtaposed Shapiro with Richard Spencer, perhaps the best known American neo-Nazi, as if Shapiro had anything to do with Spencer, whom Shapiro has repeatedly and vociferously condemned.\nComparing Shapiro to Spencer is about as true a sign of being an utterly insipid dunderhead as one could possibly concoct. Spencer is a notorious \u201calt-right\u201d Jew-hating provocateur, and Shapiro was the single most targeted journalist during the 2016 election precisely due, in part, to his consistently staunch criticisms of the anti-Semitic \u201calt-right.\u201d\n\u201cThis, from [Talia Lavin] in The Washington Post, is the sheerest form of disgusting bulls***,\u201d Shapiro tweeted. \u201cI blamed no one for the Notre Dame fire, since it was an accident by all available evidence, and imputing malicious intent to me is simply gross.\u201d\nAlas, \u201cwatchdog\u201d left-wing, pro-Clinton activist group Media Matters for America (MMFA) then saw fit to chime in. And what a doozy it was.\nIn an astonishing reply tweet that has somehow still not been deleted, MMFA replied back to Shapiro with, \u201cF*** you and the burro you rode in on.\u201d\nShapiro, screen-shotting the MMFA tweet in case the left-wing activist group subsequently deletes it, snarkily replied on his own: \u201cI very much look forward to the media continuing to quote this garbage smear organization as a \u2018media watchdog\u2019 in every \u2018objective\u2019 news article.\u201d\nShapiro is no stranger to MMFA, having written a Daily Wire piece just last month entitled, \u201cMedia Matters Makes America A Worse Place, One Bad Faith Hit At A Time\u201d:\nThis was, from the first, an obvious political hit. Media Matters, contrary to media descriptions, isn\u2019t a \u201cmedia watchdog organization.\u201d It is a political smear factory designed to perform precisely that function against anyone to the right of Hillary Clinton. The organization was founded by professional smear artist David Brock, in conjunction with the Center for American Progress, an organization itself founded by John Podesta, the Clinton White House Chief of Staff. Hillary Clinton herself advised Brock on the creation of the organization. Mega-donor Leftist George Soros has poured money into the organization, announcing in 2010, \u201cMedia Matters is one of the few groups that attempts to hold Fox News accountable for the false and misleading information they so often broadcast. I am supporting Media Matters in an effort to more widely publicize the challenge Fox News poses to civil and informed discourse in our democracy.\u201d Media Matters had regular strategy calls with the Obama White House.\nFor years, Media Matters has operated as an aggressive wing of Clintonworld, going so far as to suggest hiring private investigators to dig up dirt on Fox News hosts. Media Matters consistently attempts to tear down conservative hosts by either ripping them out of context or by digging up old Bad Things\u2122, then astroturfing public pressure against advertisers. In reality, no real grassroots pressure exists in the vast majority of cases; the data show that secondary boycotts actually don\u2019t materialize. But Media Matters simply contacts its list of activists, then has them contact advertisers, saying that they\u2019ll stop using a product if that advertiser doesn\u2019t pull its advertising. A few tweets or well-placed phone calls can knock an advertiser off a show. This last tactic, the launching of secondary boycotts, has been successfully used against advertisers across a broad range of conservative programming; advertisers are, understandably, risk averse, and so take any sign of discontent as a rationale for pulling their money. This leads, eventually, to the complete abandonment of advertisers support on political shows \u2014 at least from the right.\nAlas, even after MMFA savagely and grotesquely goes after a prominent conservative commentator in defense of an indefensibly defamatory Washington Post screed, do not get your hopes up for the mainstream media to start treating MMFA like the left-wing militant aggressor that it is.",

The film is inspired by the true story of a tour of the Deep South by the African-American classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley, played by Mahershala Ali, and his driver, Tony Lip, played by Viggo Mortensen.</p>\n<p>The movie has renewed interest in the history of <em>The Negro Motorist Green Book</em>.

She also happens to be a former <em>Democracy Now!</em> producer.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s great to have you back here, Yoruba.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> It&rsquo;s great to be here, always.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Congratulations on this film.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> Thank you. Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Talk about the history and what inspired you to do this film.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> So, let&rsquo;s see. There&rsquo;s so much history within the pages of <em>The Green Book</em>. <em>The Green Book</em> was created and first published in 1936 by a man named Victor Hugo Green. He was a postal worker based in Harlem. And he had the idea for the book because of a Jewish friend of his had a guide for the Catskills for Jewish families, where they could go in the Catskills. And he looked at that, and he said, &ldquo;Hey, this would be a great idea. This is something that the black community needs.&rdquo; He also had a&mdash;was married to a woman named Alma, who lived in Virginia, and they would travel down to Virginia. And he, you know, experienced all the things that African Americans experienced at that time in terms of traveling. And so he created <em>The Green Book</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> You narrate this film, I want to take it&mdash;go back to the film, as you describe and show this history of <em>The Green Book</em>.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> Victor Green was a postal worker from Harlem, New York, one of the fastest-growing African-American communities in the country. But even in his own neighborhood, African Americans were unwelcome at many hotels and other establishments. And at Harlem&rsquo;s famed nightclubs, such as the Cotton Club, where top black entertainers, like Lena Horne and Duke Ellington, packed the house every night, blacks were not allowed to sit in the audience. In 1936, Green created and published the first <em>Negro Motorist Green-Book</em>, which listed businesses where black customers were welcome.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>THE GREEN BOOK 1948:</strong> The idea of <em>The Green Book</em> is to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trips more enjoyable.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> <em>The Green Book</em> started out only listing locations in New York, mainly in Harlem. Two of the most prominent were the Hotel Theresa and the YMCA, which served as one of Harlem&rsquo;s most important recreational and cultural centers. During the 1930s, dancers from the Cotton Club rehearsed at the YMCA. And many famous luminaries, such as writer Langston Hughes and boxer Joe Lewis, stayed there. But <em>The Green Book</em> would soon outgrow Harlem. And by the time it ended publication, it had become more than just a travel guide. It had become a roadmap to some of the most significant people, successful businesses and most important political milestones of the 20th century.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>HENRIE MONTEITH TREADWELL:</strong> It&rsquo;s important to have everyone in this nation examine the significance of <em>The Green Book</em>. If you don&rsquo;t see the history, if you don&rsquo;t see where it was, how can you say it happened?</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> Eventually, <em>The Green Book</em> would list more than 9,500 places between its pages. Today, only about a third of those sites are still standing.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>HENRIE MONTEITH TREADWELL:</strong> We need to find those places, and we need to see them, and we need to revere what they meant, because they made all the difference to our survival.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>THE GREEN BOOK 1947:</strong> Carry your <em>Green Book</em> with you. You may need it.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> An excerpt of the Smithsonian&rsquo;s new documentary <em>The Green Book: Guide to Freedom</em>. Our guest is Yoruba Richen, who is the filmmaker who made this documentary. &ldquo;You may need it.&rdquo; This was not just about where you could go to have fun; this was about where you could go to ensure you would survive.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> Absolutely, absolutely. Traveling during that time, for African Americans, was, to say the least, a dangerous proposition. Not only was there segregation in the South, places where African Americans obviously were not allowed to go, to eat, to sleep, but also the North and the West. So, you know, there&rsquo;s this mythology that racism and segregation is confined to the South, or was confined to the South. That&rsquo;s not true. The North and the West had the majority of what we call &ldquo;sundown towns,&rdquo; places where African Americans had to get out, had to leave town. There were maybe signs, a bell might be rung, for African Americans to leave the town. They were not welcome, and there was the potential for violence.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> After midnight. In the daytime, they could work there.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> Yes, they could work there, and then they had to leave.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> In fact, that was also referenced in the Hollywood film <em>Green Book</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> Absolutely, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Which has been criticized for various reasons&mdash;</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> Right.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> &mdash;the perspective it was told from, the white driver&rsquo;s son&mdash;it was based on his book&mdash;and not consulting Don Shirley&rsquo;s family.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> This remarkable pianist, classical, jazz, who took this tour in 1962 through the South. But you definitely have the sense of violence he faced. And his going to&mdash;well, talk about, in the Hollywood film, the places he went to, versus, well, all the places that are documented in <em>The Green Book</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> Yeah, I mean, that was one of the most frustrating parts for me and for many people watching the Hollywood film, is that the film is called <i>The Green Book</i>&mdash;<i>The Green Book</i> is only a small part of the film&mdash;but the places that they went to were really not nice places. They were&mdash;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Dumps.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> &mdash;dumpy. Yeah, they were dumps. And that&rsquo;s not what was in <em>The Green Book</em>. That&rsquo;s not the extent. <em>The Green Book</em> had 9,500 listings over the period of 30-some-odd years. And, you know, one of those places was the Gaston Motel, the finest motel, a Negro motel, in the country. So, that was a real misrepresentation. And the other thing&mdash;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> In fact, we were just in Birmingham this weekend, the Gaston Hotel not far from the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, and they&rsquo;re talking about now renovating it&mdash;</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> Absolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> &mdash;and preserving it.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. It&rsquo;s really exciting. The other thing the film did was that the driver and Dr. Shirley only used the book in the South. So, when they were in the North and in the West, you didn&rsquo;t see them using the book. And then, when they get to the South is when they use the book. And as I said before, that&rsquo;s not true. I mean, these listings were all over, because African Americans had to navigate those dangerous roads all over the country.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> We&rsquo;re going to break, and when we come back, we&rsquo;re going to talk about some of these places, like Idlewild, and also talk about the role of Esso, the oil company. Yoruba Richen is the writer and director of <em>The Green Book: Guide to Freedom</em>, which will be premiering on Smithsonian Channel on Monday. Stay with us.</p>\n<p>[break]</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> &ldquo;Ride On Red, Ride On&rdquo; by Louisiana Red. This is <em>Democracy Now!</em>, democracynow.org, <em>The War and Peace Report</em>. I&rsquo;m Amy Goodman. We&rsquo;re talking about the new documentary <em>The Green Book: Guide to Freedom</em>, which will premiere Monday on Smithsonian Channel. I want to go to another clip.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> One black resort in northwest Michigan would become legendary: Idlewild.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>MARILYN S. TAYLOR:</strong> My dad was a lawyer in Detroit. And he purchased land when I was 7, and built this house. So I&rsquo;ve been here since I was 7 years old, and now I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be 78. This was a place that you were free to bike. We were free to swim. We were free to just visit with each other and have a wonderful time. And we would ride every morning, and then come home and have lunch, and then go to the beach in the afternoon. You met your friends. You played cards. You swam. And you had fun for the afternoon until the 6:00 whistle. And then you had to come home.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> During its heyday in the 1950s, Idlewild was one of the largest resort communities in the Midwest. The beating heart of Idlewild&rsquo;s booming night life was the Flamingo Club, owned by developer Phil Giles.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>BETTY FOOTE:</strong> First it was a bar and a patio. Then he added the club part. Then, that&rsquo;s when it became the Flamingo Club. And he really put Idlewild on the map. It was just nothing but people. Nothing but people. Senators, political people&mdash;everybody came to Idlewild.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p>I was born and reared here. I&rsquo;m 81 years old. So, those were my mentors. The ladies were so glamorous and dressed so glamorous, and the men were, ah, to die for. This place was so full all the time. They would run out of spaces to live, you know, accommodations&mdash;no hotel rooms, nothing left. They would take their baths in the lake and then change and dress out of their cars. But they wasn&rsquo;t gonna leave Idlewild.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>LOIS PERRY:</strong> That&rsquo;s right.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> World-famous performers entertained the visitors to the resort&mdash;among them, Louis Armstrong and Dinah Washington.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>LOIS PERRY:</strong> They were singing and jamming on the inside. I was a waitress. Sarah Vaughan was my&mdash;that was my lady. And I waited on her. And when I carried her change&mdash;she had gave me a $100 bill&mdash;she said, &ldquo;Keep the change, darlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> A clip from <em>The Green Book: Guide to Freedom</em>, premiering Monday on Smithsonian Channel. Idlewild, the significance, the dignity of it, and where&mdash;how it stands today?</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> I&rsquo;m so happy you played that clip, Amy. That&rsquo;s one of my favorite parts of the film, that we got to show this community&mdash;and there were many communities like it all over the country&mdash;where African Americans developed this community for themselves to have vacation and relax in safety, and a safe haven. That&rsquo;s what everybody said when we went up there and filmed.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And let&rsquo;s be clear: This is the North.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> This is the North. This is in northwest Michigan, upper Michigan. And it was&mdash;it&rsquo;s such a beautiful place. The history is amazing. The development started in 1910 by one of the first African-American heart surgeons at University of Chicago. These people have been there for generations, and they have such pride in their community. At its heyday, as it says in the film, there were&mdash;at one point it was the biggest resort in the Midwest, black or white. And today, of course, it&rsquo;s not the heyday that it was, but folks are trying to develop the buildings, redevelop the buildings, encourage people to come back. There are events there. And as one of the characters, one of the subjects, says in the film, the soil is so rich, you know, you really feel it when you&rsquo;re there.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And you&rsquo;re going to be having a showing in Detroit.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> That&rsquo;s right. We are screening in Detroit on Monday night, the night of the broadcast. So I&rsquo;m really excited. We have somebody from Idlewild who&rsquo;s going to be on our panel, Jamon Jordan, who&rsquo;s in the clip. So, it&rsquo;s going to be great.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> I wanted to turn to the 1949 edition of <em>The Negro Motorist Green Book</em>. On the cover it says, &ldquo;Carry your Green Book with you&mdash;You may need it.&rdquo; And under that is a quote by Mark Twain: &ldquo;Travel is fatal to prejudice.&rdquo; Inside, on page three, just after the introduction, is a column by Wendell P. Alston, a special representative of the Esso Standard Oil Company, titled, &ldquo;The Green Book helps solve your travel problems.&rdquo; Alston writes, quote, &ldquo;The Negro traveler&rsquo;s inconveniences are many and they are increasing because today so many more are traveling, individually and in groups.&rdquo; On the next page is a picture of Alston along with James A. Jackson, with the caption, &ldquo;Special representatives of the Esso marketers in their New York office.&rdquo; Talk about the role of Esso and these two African-American men in <em>The Green Book</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> Absolutely. That was one of the most interesting discoveries that we had in making this film. Esso gas station, which was Standard Oil, owned by Standard Oil, which was owned by Rockefeller, had a very early program to promote to African Americans, and not only that, but to hire African-American scientists and chemists. He was married to a woman named Spelman. Her last name was Spelman. They come from a long line of abolitionists. Spelman College, the HBCU in Atlanta, was created by their family. So there was a history of this corporate behemoth working with the African-American community. And they distributed <em>The Green Book</em> at their Esso gas stations. And that is how&mdash;one of the ways that <em>The Green Book</em> was able to be so widely distributed and so popular.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> You also talk about the women entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> Absolutely. You know, the women&mdash;the stories that we were finding and that we were coming upon, so many of them were women-owned businesses. And at one point, I start looking through the pages of <em>The Green Book</em>. They&rsquo;re all online; the Schomburg has them all online, so anybody can look and look up their town to see what&rsquo;s listed. But there are all these pictures of women owners, of women business owners. They had sent in their pictures. They were advertising in it. And, you know, everything from restaurants and motels and hotels. So, black women entrepreneurship is something that is a part of our experience and a part of our history.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Are you astounded&mdash;in these last 30 seconds&mdash;that you had heard nothing about <em>The Green Book</em> when you were asked to do this documentary?</p>\n<p><strong>YORUBA RICHEN:</strong> It was divine timing.

The film premieres Monday on the Smithsonian Channel and details the violence, insults and discrimination black travelers faced on the road, as well as the pride and sense of community they felt in the safe spaces they created around the country, in the form of restaurants, hotels and vacation retreats. We feature excerpts and speak with writer and director Yoruba Richen, professor in the documentary program in the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! I\u2019m Amy Goodman. The Academy Awards take place Sunday. One of the top contenders for a number of Oscars\u2014for best picture, best actor, supporting actor, screenplay, editing\u2014is the movie Green Book. The film is inspired by the true story of a tour of the Deep South by the African-American classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley, played by Mahershala Ali, and his driver, Tony Lip, played by Viggo Mortensen.\nThe movie has renewed interest in the history of The Negro Motorist Green Book. And today we look at a remarkable new documentary that offers a real look at the history of a travel guide that helped African Americans safely navigate Jim Crow America. It details the violence, the insults, the discrimination black travelers faced on the road, as well as the pride and sense of community they felt in the safe spaces they created around the country, in the form of restaurants, hotels and vacation retreats. The film is called The Green Book: Guide to Freedom. This is the trailer.\nMARQUETTE FOLLEY: Very bad things happened to African Americans. Going down a dark country road, there was a sense of apprehension. You could actually be lynched.\nYORUBA RICHEN: That became a roadmap.\nUNIDENTIFIED: Right when you open up, it says, \u201cKnow your rights.\u201d And it goes state by state.\nYORUBA RICHEN: For some of the most significant people, successful businesses and most important political milestones of the 20th century.\nJAMON JORDAN: Having a car meant something. It meant that you had arrived.\nUNIDENTIFIED: There were all kinds of businesses listed, just what you would find in a AAA guide, but also very telling in terms of how many areas black people were shut out of.\nUNIDENTIFIED: It uncovers a hidden truth about the African-American community. It allows us to really just simply embrace the genius of us.\nMARQUETTE FOLLEY: The guide to travel and vacations.\nUNIDENTIFIED: You may need it.\nAMY GOODMAN: That\u2019s the trailer for The Green Book: Guide to Freedom. The film premieres Monday on the Smithsonian Channel.\nFor more, we\u2019re joined here in our New York studio by its writer and director, Yoruba Richen, a professor in the documentary program in the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY. She also happens to be a former Democracy Now! producer.\nIt\u2019s great to have you back here, Yoruba.\nYORUBA RICHEN: It\u2019s great to be here, always.\nAMY GOODMAN: Congratulations on this film.\nYORUBA RICHEN: Thank you. Thank you.\nAMY GOODMAN: Talk about the history and what inspired you to do this film.\nYORUBA RICHEN: So, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s so much history within the pages of The Green Book. The Green Book was created and first published in 1936 by a man named Victor Hugo Green. He was a postal worker based in Harlem. And he had the idea for the book because of a Jewish friend of his had a guide for the Catskills for Jewish families, where they could go in the Catskills. And he looked at that, and he said, \u201cHey, this would be a great idea. This is something that the black community needs.\u201d He also had a\u2014was married to a woman named Alma, who lived in Virginia, and they would travel down to Virginia. And he, you know, experienced all the things that African Americans experienced at that time in terms of traveling. And so he created The Green Book.\nAMY GOODMAN: You narrate this film, I want to take it\u2014go back to the film, as you describe and show this history of The Green Book.\nYORUBA RICHEN: Victor Green was a postal worker from Harlem, New York, one of the fastest-growing African-American communities in the country. But even in his own neighborhood, African Americans were unwelcome at many hotels and other establishments. And at Harlem\u2019s famed nightclubs, such as the Cotton Club, where top black entertainers, like Lena Horne and Duke Ellington, packed the house every night, blacks were not allowed to sit in the audience. In 1936, Green created and published the first Negro Motorist Green-Book, which listed businesses where black customers were welcome.\nTHE GREEN BOOK 1948: The idea of The Green Book is to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trips more enjoyable.\nYORUBA RICHEN: The Green Book started out only listing locations in New York, mainly in Harlem. Two of the most prominent were the Hotel Theresa and the YMCA, which served as one of Harlem\u2019s most important recreational and cultural centers. During the 1930s, dancers from the Cotton Club rehearsed at the YMCA. And many famous luminaries, such as writer Langston Hughes and boxer Joe Lewis, stayed there. But The Green Book would soon outgrow Harlem. And by the time it ended publication, it had become more than just a travel guide. It had become a roadmap to some of the most significant people, successful businesses and most important political milestones of the 20th century.\nHENRIE MONTEITH TREADWELL: It\u2019s important to have everyone in this nation examine the significance of The Green Book. If you don\u2019t see the history, if you don\u2019t see where it was, how can you say it happened?\nYORUBA RICHEN: Eventually, The Green Book would list more than 9,500 places between its pages. Today, only about a third of those sites are still standing.\nHENRIE MONTEITH TREADWELL: We need to find those places, and we need to see them, and we need to revere what they meant, because they made all the difference to our survival.\nTHE GREEN BOOK 1947: Carry your Green Book with you. You may need it.\nAMY GOODMAN: An excerpt of the Smithsonian\u2019s new documentary The Green Book: Guide to Freedom. Our guest is Yoruba Richen, who is the filmmaker who made this documentary. \u201cYou may need it.\u201d This was not just about where you could go to have fun; this was about where you could go to ensure you would survive.\nYORUBA RICHEN: Absolutely, absolutely. Traveling during that time, for African Americans, was, to say the least, a dangerous proposition. Not only was there segregation in the South, places where African Americans obviously were not allowed to go, to eat, to sleep, but also the North and the West. So, you know, there\u2019s this mythology that racism and segregation is confined to the South, or was confined to the South. That\u2019s not true. The North and the West had the majority of what we call \u201csundown towns,\u201d places where African Americans had to get out, had to leave town. There were maybe signs, a bell might be rung, for African Americans to leave the town. They were not welcome, and there was the potential for violence.\nAMY GOODMAN: After midnight. In the daytime, they could work there.\nYORUBA RICHEN: Yes, they could work there, and then they had to leave.\nAMY GOODMAN: In fact, that was also referenced in the Hollywood film Green Book.\nYORUBA RICHEN: Absolutely, yeah.\nAMY GOODMAN: Which has been criticized for various reasons\u2014\nYORUBA RICHEN: Right.\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014the perspective it was told from, the white driver\u2019s son\u2014it was based on his book\u2014and not consulting Don Shirley\u2019s family.\nYORUBA RICHEN: Yeah.\nAMY GOODMAN: This remarkable pianist, classical, jazz, who took this tour in 1962 through the South. But you definitely have the sense of violence he faced. And his going to\u2014well, talk about, in the Hollywood film, the places he went to, versus, well, all the places that are documented in The Green Book.\nYORUBA RICHEN: Yeah, I mean, that was one of the most frustrating parts for me and for many people watching the Hollywood film, is that the film is called The Green Book\u2014The Green Book is only a small part of the film\u2014but the places that they went to were really not nice places. They were\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: Dumps.\nYORUBA RICHEN: \u2014dumpy. Yeah, they were dumps. And that\u2019s not what was in The Green Book. That\u2019s not the extent. The Green Book had 9,500 listings over the period of 30-some-odd years. And, you know, one of those places was the Gaston Motel, the finest motel, a Negro motel, in the country. So, that was a real misrepresentation. And the other thing\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: In fact, we were just in Birmingham this weekend, the Gaston Hotel not far from the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, and they\u2019re talking about now renovating it\u2014\nYORUBA RICHEN: Absolutely.\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014and preserving it.\nYORUBA RICHEN: Yeah, absolutely. It\u2019s really exciting. The other thing the film did was that the driver and Dr. Shirley only used the book in the South. So, when they were in the North and in the West, you didn\u2019t see them using the book. And then, when they get to the South is when they use the book. And as I said before, that\u2019s not true. I mean, these listings were all over, because African Americans had to navigate those dangerous roads all over the country.\nAMY GOODMAN: We\u2019re going to break, and when we come back, we\u2019re going to talk about some of these places, like Idlewild, and also talk about the role of Esso, the oil company. Yoruba Richen is the writer and director of The Green Book: Guide to Freedom, which will be premiering on Smithsonian Channel on Monday. Stay with us.\n[break]\nAMY GOODMAN: \u201cRide On Red, Ride On\u201d by Louisiana Red. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I\u2019m Amy Goodman. We\u2019re talking about the new documentary The Green Book: Guide to Freedom, which will premiere Monday on Smithsonian Channel. I want to go to another clip.\nYORUBA RICHEN: One black resort in northwest Michigan would become legendary: Idlewild.\nMARILYN S. TAYLOR: My dad was a lawyer in Detroit. And he purchased land when I was 7, and built this house. So I\u2019ve been here since I was 7 years old, and now I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019ll be 78. This was a place that you were free to bike. We were free to swim. We were free to just visit with each other and have a wonderful time. And we would ride every morning, and then come home and have lunch, and then go to the beach in the afternoon. You met your friends. You played cards. You swam. And you had fun for the afternoon until the 6:00 whistle. And then you had to come home.\nYORUBA RICHEN: During its heyday in the 1950s, Idlewild was one of the largest resort communities in the Midwest. The beating heart of Idlewild\u2019s booming night life was the Flamingo Club, owned by developer Phil Giles.\nBETTY FOOTE: First it was a bar and a patio. Then he added the club part. Then, that\u2019s when it became the Flamingo Club. And he really put Idlewild on the map. It was just nothing but people. Nothing but people. Senators, political people\u2014everybody came to Idlewild.\nI was born and reared here. I\u2019m 81 years old. So, those were my mentors. The ladies were so glamorous and dressed so glamorous, and the men were, ah, to die for. This place was so full all the time. They would run out of spaces to live, you know, accommodations\u2014no hotel rooms, nothing left. They would take their baths in the lake and then change and dress out of their cars. But they wasn\u2019t gonna leave Idlewild.\nLOIS PERRY: That\u2019s right.\nYORUBA RICHEN: World-famous performers entertained the visitors to the resort\u2014among them, Louis Armstrong and Dinah Washington.\nLOIS PERRY: They were singing and jamming on the inside. I was a waitress. Sarah Vaughan was my\u2014that was my lady. And I waited on her. And when I carried her change\u2014she had gave me a $100 bill\u2014she said, \u201cKeep the change, darlin\u2019.\u201d\nAMY GOODMAN: A clip from The Green Book: Guide to Freedom, premiering Monday on Smithsonian Channel. Idlewild, the significance, the dignity of it, and where\u2014how it stands today?\nYORUBA RICHEN: I\u2019m so happy you played that clip, Amy. That\u2019s one of my favorite parts of the film, that we got to show this community\u2014and there were many communities like it all over the country\u2014where African Americans developed this community for themselves to have vacation and relax in safety, and a safe haven. That\u2019s what everybody said when we went up there and filmed.\nAMY GOODMAN: And let\u2019s be clear: This is the North.\nYORUBA RICHEN: This is the North. This is in northwest Michigan, upper Michigan. And it was\u2014it\u2019s such a beautiful place. The history is amazing. The development started in 1910 by one of the first African-American heart surgeons at University of Chicago. These people have been there for generations, and they have such pride in their community. At its heyday, as it says in the film, there were\u2014at one point it was the biggest resort in the Midwest, black or white. And today, of course, it\u2019s not the heyday that it was, but folks are trying to develop the buildings, redevelop the buildings, encourage people to come back. There are events there. And as one of the characters, one of the subjects, says in the film, the soil is so rich, you know, you really feel it when you\u2019re there.\nAMY GOODMAN: And you\u2019re going to be having a showing in Detroit.\nYORUBA RICHEN: That\u2019s right. We are screening in Detroit on Monday night, the night of the broadcast. So I\u2019m really excited. We have somebody from Idlewild who\u2019s going to be on our panel, Jamon Jordan, who\u2019s in the clip. So, it\u2019s going to be great.\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to turn to the 1949 edition of The Negro Motorist Green Book. On the cover it says, \u201cCarry your Green Book with you\u2014You may need it.\u201d And under that is a quote by Mark Twain: \u201cTravel is fatal to prejudice.\u201d Inside, on page three, just after the introduction, is a column by Wendell P. Alston, a special representative of the Esso Standard Oil Company, titled, \u201cThe Green Book helps solve your travel problems.\u201d Alston writes, quote, \u201cThe Negro traveler\u2019s inconveniences are many and they are increasing because today so many more are traveling, individually and in groups.\u201d On the next page is a picture of Alston along with James A. Jackson, with the caption, \u201cSpecial representatives of the Esso marketers in their New York office.\u201d Talk about the role of Esso and these two African-American men in The Green Book.\nYORUBA RICHEN: Absolutely. That was one of the most interesting discoveries that we had in making this film. Esso gas station, which was Standard Oil, owned by Standard Oil, which was owned by Rockefeller, had a very early program to promote to African Americans, and not only that, but to hire African-American scientists and chemists. He was married to a woman named Spelman. Her last name was Spelman. They come from a long line of abolitionists. Spelman College, the HBCU in Atlanta, was created by their family. So there was a history of this corporate behemoth working with the African-American community. And they distributed The Green Book at their Esso gas stations. And that is how\u2014one of the ways that The Green Book was able to be so widely distributed and so popular.\nAMY GOODMAN: You also talk about the women entrepreneurs.\nYORUBA RICHEN: Absolutely. You know, the women\u2014the stories that we were finding and that we were coming upon, so many of them were women-owned businesses. And at one point, I start looking through the pages of The Green Book. They\u2019re all online; the Schomburg has them all online, so anybody can look and look up their town to see what\u2019s listed. But there are all these pictures of women owners, of women business owners. They had sent in their pictures. They were advertising in it. And, you know, everything from restaurants and motels and hotels. So, black women entrepreneurship is something that is a part of our experience and a part of our history.\nAMY GOODMAN: Are you astounded\u2014in these last 30 seconds\u2014that you had heard nothing about The Green Book when you were asked to do this documentary?\nYORUBA RICHEN: It was divine timing. I mean, no, it\u2019s amazing. What I am also very excited about is that the fiction film has given visibility to this piece. And hopefully people will\u2014you know, their interest will be piqued by the fiction film, no matter what happens on Sunday night, and then they will come and watch this documentary.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, the Oscars Sunday night, and your film, The Green Book: Guide to Freedom, will premiere on Monday night on Smithsonian Channel. Yoruba Richen, director and writer and of The Green Book: Guide to Freedom, professor in the documentary program in the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY.\nThat does it for our show.

Guaid&oacute; claims he is preparing to deliver humanitarian aid from the Colombian border Saturday. Maduro has rejected the plan, saying the effort is part of a broader attempt to overthrow his regime. This comes as Trump&rsquo;s special envoy to Venezuela and right-wing hawk, Elliott Abrams, is leading a U.S. delegation traveling by military aircraft to the Colombian border, supposedly to help deliver the aid. The United Nations, the Red Cross and other relief organizations have refused to work with the U.S. on delivering that aid to Venezuela, which they say is politically motivated. We speak with Venezuelan sociologist Edgardo Lander, a member of the Citizen&rsquo;s Platform in Defense of the Constitution. &ldquo;This certainly is not humanitarian aid, and it&rsquo;s not oriented with any humanitarian aims,&rdquo; Lander says. &ldquo;This is clearly a coup carried out by the United States government with its allies, with the Lima Group and the extreme right wing in Venezuela.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> We begin today&rsquo;s show in Venezuela, where a standoff is escalating as opposition leader and self-proclaimed president Juan Guaid&oacute; claims he&rsquo;s preparing to deliver so-called humanitarian aid from the Colombian border Saturday. Venezuelan President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro has rejected the plan, saying the effort is part of a broader attempt to overthrow his regime.</p>\n<p>This comes as Trump&rsquo;s special envoy to Venezuela and right-wing hawk, Elliott Abrams, is leading a U.S. delegation traveling by military aircraft to the Colombian-Venezuelan border, supposedly to help deliver the aid. It&rsquo;s been one month since the U.S. recognized Guaid&oacute; as Venezuela&rsquo;s new president, in an attempt to oust Maduro from power. Since then, it&rsquo;s placed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela&rsquo;s state-run oil company and rejected calls for an international dialogue to resolve the crisis. The United Nations, the Red Cross and other relief organizations have refused to work with the U.S. on delivering that aid to Venezuela, which these groups say is politically motivated.</p>\n<p>This is Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid&oacute; speaking to Fox Business.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>JUAN GUAID&Oacute;:</strong> [translated] We will have a fantastic opportunity this Saturday to accept important humanitarian aid that the government in Venezuela has forbidden. And we have a fantastic example to pull our country out of this crisis.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> On Thursday, Venezuelan President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro announced plans to close the border with Brazil, and possibly also with Colombia, ahead of the Venezuelan opposition&rsquo;s plans to bring in the aid despite his objection.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>PRESIDENT NICOL&Aacute;S MADURO:</strong> [translated] Starting at 8 p.m. today, Thursday, February 21st, the land border with Brazil will be completely and absolutely closed until further notice. It is better to prevent than to regret, to take all the measures for the assurance and protection of our people. I am considering a complete closure of the border with Colombia. A prepared man is worth two. A prepared people is worth two.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Tonight, the Venezuela-Colombia border will be the site of dueling concerts&mdash;one organized by the British billionaire Richard Branson, the other by the Venezuelan government. This comes as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to visit Colombia Monday to demand President Maduro step down. Pence will deliver remarks to the Lima Group. Mexico is the only country in the group of 14 nations that has refused to recognize Juan Guaid&oacute; as Venezuela&rsquo;s new president.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Medea Benjamin, the co-founder of the peace group CodePink, disrupted an event there, where Guaid&oacute;&rsquo;s envoy to the United States spoke.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>CARLOS VECCHIO:</strong> So, Gustavo.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>MEDEA BENJAMIN:</strong> Excuse me. Just as you are trying to take over the Venezuelan government, I want to say these people are a fraud. They don&rsquo;t represent the Venezuelan people. They are representing the U.S.-orchestrated coup. This is a very dangerous situation. They want to create a crisis at the border that would be a justification for U.S. intervention. This has nothing to do with a humanitarian situation. Indeed, for a humanitarian situation, the U.S. would lift the economic sanctions that have exacerbated the crisis. The issue at the border now is something that is politicizing humanitarian aid. That is why the Red Cross, the United Nations and all the legitimate humanitarian groups have insisted that they will not touch this aid.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p>What we need now is negotiations. These people here want to take Venezuela to a path of civil war and U.S. intervention. What the Venezuelan people need is negotiations mediated by Mexico&mdash;I&rsquo;m almost finished&mdash;mediated by Mexico, by the Uruguayans and by the Vatican. So, let&rsquo;s say that if you indeed care about the people of Venezuela, you will be calling for negotiations. You will not recognize these people who are willing pawns in a Trump-orchestrated coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat. Thank you for listening to the voice of reason.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> That was Medea Benjamin [inaudible] Venezuela news conference in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>Well, for more, we go to Caracas, Venezuela, where we&rsquo;re joined by Edgardo Lander, a sociologist who&rsquo;s part of the Citizen&rsquo;s Platform in Defense of the Constitution. Lander is a retired professor at the Central University of Venezuela. Because it&rsquo;s in Caracas, there is a long audio delay, so please bear with us.</p>\n<p>Edgardo Lander, welcome to <em>Democracy Now!</em> Can you describe the situation in the country right now and the effect of the pressure on the border?</p>\n<p><strong>EDGARDO LANDER:</strong> Good morning, Amy. Glad to be with you.</p>\n<p>The situation in Venezuela right now is really quite, quite tense. The 23rd&mdash;that is, Saturday&mdash;when the so-called humanitarian aid is supposed to come into the country, according to Guaid&oacute;&rsquo;s people, no matter what, presents a very, very serious threat to Venezuela, a very serious threat in terms of the possibilities of violence. This is certainly not some humanitarian aid; it&rsquo;s a humanitarian intervention.</p>\n<p>If the United States were really interested in democracy&mdash;the government, of course, were interested in democracy and human rights and the humanitarian situation of the Venezuelan population, the first thing they will have to do is stop the blockade that&rsquo;s impacting the Venezuelan people enormously, as the Venezuelan government has extreme difficulties in gaining access to foreign markets. Its trade is made extremely difficult because the whole financial system is, in one way or another, controlled by the United States. And this blockade limits the possibilities of access to trade partners, etc.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, enormous amounts of money, billions of dollars in Venezuelan assets, have been taken over by the U.S. government. And it&rsquo;s absolutely cynical that the U.S. government is claiming to be worried about the humanitarian situation of Venezuelans, offering a few million dollars, when billions of dollars are being kept away from the Venezuelan government&rsquo;s capacity to respond to the deep crisis that the Venezuelans are facing.</p>\n<p>There is this threat of going into Venezuela no matter what. The hawks and the neocons that accompany Trump in these policies are well known. These are people like Abrams or&mdash;Elliott, or Bolton, that have had well-known trajectories of military interventions in different places of the world. And obviously there&rsquo;s no concern whatsoever for the lives of Venezuelan people. The situation is so tense that the 23rd could be the spark that starts a violent, even civil war situation in the country. So, the absolute need to find some sort of solution, some sort of negotiation, that would stop this escalation of violence, is absolutely critical. And this has to be done soon, because Saturday is a very critical day.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> So, if you can talk about the role of Venezuelans themselves in negotiating a solution? The possibility, the calls for the pope to be involved&mdash;of course, the pope is originally from Argentina&mdash;the pope to be involved, Mexico to be involved, with the new president, AMLO, Andr&eacute;s Manuel L&oacute;pez Obrador. And what about the people themselves in Venezuela? Your group&mdash;what is Citizen&rsquo;s Platform calling for?</p>\n<p><strong>EDGARDO LANDER:</strong> The Citizen&rsquo;s Platform in Defense of the Constitution is calling for a referendum that has been established in the Venezuelan Constitution when issues of critical national importance have to be faced. This is a situation where we face a deep constitutional crisis. We have a struggle between the National Assembly, on one hand, and the executive, on the other hand. They don&rsquo;t recognize each other as legitimate. And as a consequence, there is this tug in which politics is seen as an enemy-friend confrontation in which the purpose of policy is to destroy the enemy, to completely squash it. There&rsquo;s no will on either hand today to enter into some sort of agreement that would allow for the Venezuelan people to decide what they want their future to be.</p>\n<p>The Citizen&rsquo;s Platform in Defense of the Constitution, as well as other groups&mdash;mainly from the left, but not only&mdash;have been arguing that we need this consultative referendum in order to have the Venezuelan people decide if they want to have new authorities overall in the country&mdash;that is, all the national powers, including the executive and the National Assembly. But that requires an agreement, because we need a new National Electoral Council. The current Electoral Council is completely controlled by the government, and it&rsquo;s not trustworthy for the majority of the Venezuelan population. So we would need, as a first step, some basic agreement, a consensual National Electoral Council, and then this call for a referendum in which the Venezuelan people can actually give their own opinion and decide whether they want to keep the present authorities or if they want to completely renew the political system&mdash;not the structure of the system, but who&rsquo;s the president today, what&rsquo;s the Assembly.</p>\n<p>As it is right now, the National Assembly is calling for the need for presidential elections, and, on the other hand, President Maduro is calling for the need for new parliamentary elections. So, none of the sides is willing to reach an agreement. We would, of course, need some sort of accompaniment by some international actors. And as you mentioned, the possibilities of having the presidents of Uruguay, of Mexico, maybe the secretary-general of the United Nations and the pope, would be extremely critical in terms of the possibility of reaching such an agreement. So, this requires&mdash;there&rsquo;s two things: on one hand, pressure and involvement by these people who are not interested in violence but trying to avoid a civil war, and this has been the statement of Uruguay, Mexico, the pope, and, on the other hand, pressure from the Venezuelan people to have this minimal agreement for a new Electoral Council and the referendum that would let people decide.</p>\n<p>There are reasons why there is huge, huge, massive discontent in Venezuela in relation to the Maduro government. The crises that the Venezuelan people are facing are, to a great extent, the responsibility of this government, that has been extremely corrupt, inefficient, and has become increasingly repressive. But that in no way justifies a U.S. military intervention or this attempt to strangle the Venezuelan economy, which is of course doing much [more] harm to the Venezuelan people than to the Venezuelan government.</p>\n<p>So, in this situation, where today, I would say, a majority of the people in Venezuela reject the Maduro government, and, on the other hand, a great majority also reject U.S. intervention, we need a negotiation that opens the way for Venezuelans to decide by themselves. And this is the option of both this negotiation with some international backing, on one hand, and this referendum that we are calling for, from the platform and other groups in Venezuela that think that the biggest threat for Venezuelans today is the threat of this escalation of violence, the possibility of a civil war and the possibility, that has been announced again and again, of a military intervention by the United States government.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> During his speech on Monday, President Trump called Maduro a, quote, &ldquo;Cuban puppet.&rdquo; This is what he said.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:</strong> Incredibly, there are members of the Venezuelan military still barely supporting this failed dictatorship. They are risking their future. They are risking their lives and Venezuela&rsquo;s future for a man controlled by the Cuban military and protected by a private army of Cuban soldiers. Maduro is not a Venezuelan patriot; he is a Cuban puppet. That&rsquo;s what he is.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> During his speech on Monday, Trump laid out what he called a, quote, &ldquo;ugly alliance&rdquo; between Cuba and Venezuela.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:</strong> For decades, the socialist dictatorships of Cuba and Venezuela have propped each other up in a very corrupt bargain. Venezuela gave Cuba oil. In return, Cuba gave Venezuela a police state run directly from Havana. But this is a much different day, and those days are over. The ugly alliance between the two dictatorships is coming to a rapid end.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> That was President Trump speaking in Miami Monday. A new book out this week by former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe reveals Trump privately discussed going to war with Venezuela in 2017. McCabe writes, quote, &ldquo;Then the president talked about Venezuela. That&rsquo;s the country we should be going to war with, he said. They have all that oil and they&rsquo;re right on our back door.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So, Edgardo Lander, as you speak to us from Caracas, can you respond to what exactly the U.S. is doing, who Guaid&oacute; is, and this issue of humanitarian aid, the concerns of many? You have a plane that&rsquo;s been flying in back and forth, or planes, from a company in North Carolina&mdash;apparently, about 40 flights. The Venezuelan government found weapons stash, perhaps from one of those flights. It&rsquo;s a company that has previously worked with the CIA. The fact that the United Nations and the Red Cross have both said they won&rsquo;t work on this so-called humanitarian aid, because it is politically motivated, and that it is not humanitarian aid. What you think will be happening on the border, with Elliott Abrams being flown in by military transport with his delegation to the Colombia-Venezuelan border? And the significance of Maduro closing the Brazil-Venezuela border and considering closing this border, the Colombia-Venezuela border?</p>\n<p><strong>EDGARDO LANDER:</strong> Well, in the first place, I&rsquo;d like to insist on the fact that this certainly is not humanitarian aid, and it&rsquo;s not oriented with any humanitarian aims. This is clearly a coup carried out by the United States government with its allies, with the Lima Group and the extreme right wing in Venezuela. The opposition, the right-wing opposition, in Venezuela, the people who control Parliament and the opposition parties, have been weakened over the last few years, and they had not been able to agree on any single policy in relation to ways to confront the Maduro government. But now it&rsquo;s obvious that this very extreme right wing has been in close coordination with the United States government for some time now. And this script that has been followed since Guaid&oacute; self-proclaimed himself as president is a script that&rsquo;s basically a U.S. script. And this script is on the works right now.</p>\n<p>There is no concern about the situation of the Venezuelan population, because, as I said before, if you take away billions from the capacity of the government in Venezuela to respond to the needs for medicine and food, on one hand, and you offer a few million dollars in food and medicine on the Colombian border, there is no proportion whatsoever, and it&rsquo;s clear that the purpose is not to respond to the situation of the Venezuelan population, but to create a conflict in the border. As people have been called by the Guaid&oacute;&mdash;by Guaid&oacute; and his people to concentrate at the border, and this concert has been organized on the Colombian side of the government, this could lead to a confrontation between the two sides. The Venezuelan government has announced that it might close the border. It hasn&rsquo;t been decided yet. But the possibility of the closing of the border means that, as there is now&mdash;there&rsquo;s Venezuelan military presence in this side of the border, and there&rsquo;s obviously all sorts of paramilitary groups, CIA representatives, members of the armed forces of Colombia on the other side. And anything could spark some violence that could lead to the beginning of a confrontation. I don&rsquo;t think that Saturday will be D-Day, in which a great confrontation will start, but it&rsquo;s a possibility that it could be the spark that could lead to increased violence and the possibility of a civil war.</p>\n<p>So, we have to confront this supposedly humanitarian aid, which is not humanitarian aid. It&rsquo;s just direct intervention in order to have regime change, which has been the purpose of the Trump government from the very beginning. And we know what regime change has meant in other places. We know the experience of regime change in Libya. We know the experience of regime change in Iraq. We know what the people in Syria are facing today as a consequence of these imperial attempts to have regime change. So, there is no possibility that this so-called humanitarian aid will make any positive contribution to the Venezuelan situation. It&rsquo;s just going to make it worse, because it&rsquo;s deepening the crisis in terms of medicine and food for the Venezuelan people, on one hand, it&rsquo;s increasing the likelihood of an escalation of violence, and it&rsquo;s opening up the doors to the possibility of a civil war.</p>\n<p>So, the need for some sort of negotiation, for putting a stop to this escalation, and to put the blame, on one hand, on Maduro&rsquo;s responsibility for having, throughout this six years of government, created such an incredible collapse of the Venezuelan economy&mdash;today, the economy is half of what it used to be when Maduro came to power, and this is basically the government&rsquo;s responsibility. U.S. sanctions against Venezuela, Trump&rsquo;s sanctions against Venezuela, started a year and a half ago, around mid-2017. But the crisis came from way before. U.S. sanctions have deepened the crisis, but they are not the main cause of the crisis. The main cause of the crisis is ineptitude and massive corruption by the Maduro government.</p>\n<p>So, we in Venezuela are faced with these two evils, with these two confronting enemies that have the Venezuelan people in between, paying for their own ineptitude, for their own violence, for their own political purpose, which are not the purposes of the Venezuelan population. We need to have some sort of pressure on the U.S. government to stop this level of intervention, this threat of military intervention. And we have to call on the Maduro government to be willing to open up a negotiation, because there are a lot of reasons why people in Venezuela don&rsquo;t really trust Maduro when he calls about his willingness to negotiate, because he always says the same thing. But when negotiations are always carried out, they are negotiations in which he has not been willing to do anything. He hasn&rsquo;t been willing to cede on any one basic issue.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Edgardo Lander, I want to thank you&mdash;</p>\n<p><strong>EDGARDO LANDER:</strong> The Venezuela government today is&mdash;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> &mdash;for being with us.

                "text": "We go to Caracas, Venezuela, for an update on the escalating standoff between President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and opposition leader and self-proclaimed president Juan Guaid\u00f3. Guaid\u00f3 claims he is preparing to deliver humanitarian aid from the Colombian border Saturday. Maduro has rejected the plan, saying the effort is part of a broader attempt to overthrow his regime. This comes as Trump\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela and right-wing hawk, Elliott Abrams, is leading a U.S. delegation traveling by military aircraft to the Colombian border, supposedly to help deliver the aid. The United Nations, the Red Cross and other relief organizations have refused to work with the U.S. on delivering that aid to Venezuela, which they say is politically motivated. We speak with Venezuelan sociologist Edgardo Lander, a member of the Citizen\u2019s Platform in Defense of the Constitution. \u201cThis certainly is not humanitarian aid, and it\u2019s not oriented with any humanitarian aims,\u201d Lander says. \u201cThis is clearly a coup carried out by the United States government with its allies, with the Lima Group and the extreme right wing in Venezuela.\u201d\nAMY GOODMAN: We begin today\u2019s show in Venezuela, where a standoff is escalating as opposition leader and self-proclaimed president Juan Guaid\u00f3 claims he\u2019s preparing to deliver so-called humanitarian aid from the Colombian border Saturday. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has rejected the plan, saying the effort is part of a broader attempt to overthrow his regime.\nThis comes as Trump\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela and right-wing hawk, Elliott Abrams, is leading a U.S. delegation traveling by military aircraft to the Colombian-Venezuelan border, supposedly to help deliver the aid. It\u2019s been one month since the U.S. recognized Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s new president, in an attempt to oust Maduro from power. Since then, it\u2019s placed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company and rejected calls for an international dialogue to resolve the crisis. The United Nations, the Red Cross and other relief organizations have refused to work with the U.S. on delivering that aid to Venezuela, which these groups say is politically motivated.\nThis is Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 speaking to Fox Business.\nJUAN GUAID\u00d3: [translated] We will have a fantastic opportunity this Saturday to accept important humanitarian aid that the government in Venezuela has forbidden. And we have a fantastic example to pull our country out of this crisis.\nAMY GOODMAN: On Thursday, Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced plans to close the border with Brazil, and possibly also with Colombia, ahead of the Venezuelan opposition\u2019s plans to bring in the aid despite his objection.\nPRESIDENT NICOL\u00c1S MADURO: [translated] Starting at 8 p.m. today, Thursday, February 21st, the land border with Brazil will be completely and absolutely closed until further notice. It is better to prevent than to regret, to take all the measures for the assurance and protection of our people. I am considering a complete closure of the border with Colombia. A prepared man is worth two. A prepared people is worth two.\nAMY GOODMAN: Tonight, the Venezuela-Colombia border will be the site of dueling concerts\u2014one organized by the British billionaire Richard Branson, the other by the Venezuelan government. This comes as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to visit Colombia Monday to demand President Maduro step down. Pence will deliver remarks to the Lima Group. Mexico is the only country in the group of 14 nations that has refused to recognize Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s new president.\nMeanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Medea Benjamin, the co-founder of the peace group CodePink, disrupted an event there, where Guaid\u00f3\u2019s envoy to the United States spoke.\nCARLOS VECCHIO: So, Gustavo.\nMEDEA BENJAMIN: Excuse me. Just as you are trying to take over the Venezuelan government, I want to say these people are a fraud. They don\u2019t represent the Venezuelan people. They are representing the U.S.-orchestrated coup. This is a very dangerous situation. They want to create a crisis at the border that would be a justification for U.S. intervention. This has nothing to do with a humanitarian situation. Indeed, for a humanitarian situation, the U.S. would lift the economic sanctions that have exacerbated the crisis. The issue at the border now is something that is politicizing humanitarian aid. That is why the Red Cross, the United Nations and all the legitimate humanitarian groups have insisted that they will not touch this aid.\nWhat we need now is negotiations. These people here want to take Venezuela to a path of civil war and U.S. intervention. What the Venezuelan people need is negotiations mediated by Mexico\u2014I\u2019m almost finished\u2014mediated by Mexico, by the Uruguayans and by the Vatican. So, let\u2019s say that if you indeed care about the people of Venezuela, you will be calling for negotiations. You will not recognize these people who are willing pawns in a Trump-orchestrated coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Thank you for listening to the voice of reason.\nAMY GOODMAN: That was Medea Benjamin [inaudible] Venezuela news conference in Washington, D.C.\nWell, for more, we go to Caracas, Venezuela, where we\u2019re joined by Edgardo Lander, a sociologist who\u2019s part of the Citizen\u2019s Platform in Defense of the Constitution. Lander is a retired professor at the Central University of Venezuela. Because it\u2019s in Caracas, there is a long audio delay, so please bear with us.\nEdgardo Lander, welcome to Democracy Now! Can you describe the situation in the country right now and the effect of the pressure on the border?\nEDGARDO LANDER: Good morning, Amy. Glad to be with you.\nThe situation in Venezuela right now is really quite, quite tense. The 23rd\u2014that is, Saturday\u2014when the so-called humanitarian aid is supposed to come into the country, according to Guaid\u00f3\u2019s people, no matter what, presents a very, very serious threat to Venezuela, a very serious threat in terms of the possibilities of violence. This is certainly not some humanitarian aid; it\u2019s a humanitarian intervention.\nIf the United States were really interested in democracy\u2014the government, of course, were interested in democracy and human rights and the humanitarian situation of the Venezuelan population, the first thing they will have to do is stop the blockade that\u2019s impacting the Venezuelan people enormously, as the Venezuelan government has extreme difficulties in gaining access to foreign markets. Its trade is made extremely difficult because the whole financial system is, in one way or another, controlled by the United States. And this blockade limits the possibilities of access to trade partners, etc.\nOn the other hand, enormous amounts of money, billions of dollars in Venezuelan assets, have been taken over by the U.S. government. And it\u2019s absolutely cynical that the U.S. government is claiming to be worried about the humanitarian situation of Venezuelans, offering a few million dollars, when billions of dollars are being kept away from the Venezuelan government\u2019s capacity to respond to the deep crisis that the Venezuelans are facing.\nThere is this threat of going into Venezuela no matter what. The hawks and the neocons that accompany Trump in these policies are well known. These are people like Abrams or\u2014Elliott, or Bolton, that have had well-known trajectories of military interventions in different places of the world. And obviously there\u2019s no concern whatsoever for the lives of Venezuelan people. The situation is so tense that the 23rd could be the spark that starts a violent, even civil war situation in the country. So, the absolute need to find some sort of solution, some sort of negotiation, that would stop this escalation of violence, is absolutely critical. And this has to be done soon, because Saturday is a very critical day.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, if you can talk about the role of Venezuelans themselves in negotiating a solution? The possibility, the calls for the pope to be involved\u2014of course, the pope is originally from Argentina\u2014the pope to be involved, Mexico to be involved, with the new president, AMLO, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. And what about the people themselves in Venezuela? Your group\u2014what is Citizen\u2019s Platform calling for?\nEDGARDO LANDER: The Citizen\u2019s Platform in Defense of the Constitution is calling for a referendum that has been established in the Venezuelan Constitution when issues of critical national importance have to be faced. This is a situation where we face a deep constitutional crisis. We have a struggle between the National Assembly, on one hand, and the executive, on the other hand. They don\u2019t recognize each other as legitimate. And as a consequence, there is this tug in which politics is seen as an enemy-friend confrontation in which the purpose of policy is to destroy the enemy, to completely squash it. There\u2019s no will on either hand today to enter into some sort of agreement that would allow for the Venezuelan people to decide what they want their future to be.\nThe Citizen\u2019s Platform in Defense of the Constitution, as well as other groups\u2014mainly from the left, but not only\u2014have been arguing that we need this consultative referendum in order to have the Venezuelan people decide if they want to have new authorities overall in the country\u2014that is, all the national powers, including the executive and the National Assembly. But that requires an agreement, because we need a new National Electoral Council. The current Electoral Council is completely controlled by the government, and it\u2019s not trustworthy for the majority of the Venezuelan population. So we would need, as a first step, some basic agreement, a consensual National Electoral Council, and then this call for a referendum in which the Venezuelan people can actually give their own opinion and decide whether they want to keep the present authorities or if they want to completely renew the political system\u2014not the structure of the system, but who\u2019s the president today, what\u2019s the Assembly.\nAs it is right now, the National Assembly is calling for the need for presidential elections, and, on the other hand, President Maduro is calling for the need for new parliamentary elections. So, none of the sides is willing to reach an agreement. We would, of course, need some sort of accompaniment by some international actors. And as you mentioned, the possibilities of having the presidents of Uruguay, of Mexico, maybe the secretary-general of the United Nations and the pope, would be extremely critical in terms of the possibility of reaching such an agreement. So, this requires\u2014there\u2019s two things: on one hand, pressure and involvement by these people who are not interested in violence but trying to avoid a civil war, and this has been the statement of Uruguay, Mexico, the pope, and, on the other hand, pressure from the Venezuelan people to have this minimal agreement for a new Electoral Council and the referendum that would let people decide.\nThere are reasons why there is huge, huge, massive discontent in Venezuela in relation to the Maduro government. The crises that the Venezuelan people are facing are, to a great extent, the responsibility of this government, that has been extremely corrupt, inefficient, and has become increasingly repressive. But that in no way justifies a U.S. military intervention or this attempt to strangle the Venezuelan economy, which is of course doing much [more] harm to the Venezuelan people than to the Venezuelan government.\nSo, in this situation, where today, I would say, a majority of the people in Venezuela reject the Maduro government, and, on the other hand, a great majority also reject U.S. intervention, we need a negotiation that opens the way for Venezuelans to decide by themselves. And this is the option of both this negotiation with some international backing, on one hand, and this referendum that we are calling for, from the platform and other groups in Venezuela that think that the biggest threat for Venezuelans today is the threat of this escalation of violence, the possibility of a civil war and the possibility, that has been announced again and again, of a military intervention by the United States government.\nAMY GOODMAN: During his speech on Monday, President Trump called Maduro a, quote, \u201cCuban puppet.\u201d This is what he said.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Incredibly, there are members of the Venezuelan military still barely supporting this failed dictatorship. They are risking their future. They are risking their lives and Venezuela\u2019s future for a man controlled by the Cuban military and protected by a private army of Cuban soldiers. Maduro is not a Venezuelan patriot; he is a Cuban puppet. That\u2019s what he is.\nAMY GOODMAN: During his speech on Monday, Trump laid out what he called a, quote, \u201cugly alliance\u201d between Cuba and Venezuela.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: For decades, the socialist dictatorships of Cuba and Venezuela have propped each other up in a very corrupt bargain. Venezuela gave Cuba oil. In return, Cuba gave Venezuela a police state run directly from Havana. But this is a much different day, and those days are over. The ugly alliance between the two dictatorships is coming to a rapid end.\nAMY GOODMAN: That was President Trump speaking in Miami Monday. A new book out this week by former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe reveals Trump privately discussed going to war with Venezuela in 2017. McCabe writes, quote, \u201cThen the president talked about Venezuela. That\u2019s the country we should be going to war with, he said. They have all that oil and they\u2019re right on our back door.\u201d\nSo, Edgardo Lander, as you speak to us from Caracas, can you respond to what exactly the U.S. is doing, who Guaid\u00f3 is, and this issue of humanitarian aid, the concerns of many? You have a plane that\u2019s been flying in back and forth, or planes, from a company in North Carolina\u2014apparently, about 40 flights. The Venezuelan government found weapons stash, perhaps from one of those flights. It\u2019s a company that has previously worked with the CIA. The fact that the United Nations and the Red Cross have both said they won\u2019t work on this so-called humanitarian aid, because it is politically motivated, and that it is not humanitarian aid. What you think will be happening on the border, with Elliott Abrams being flown in by military transport with his delegation to the Colombia-Venezuelan border? And the significance of Maduro closing the Brazil-Venezuela border and considering closing this border, the Colombia-Venezuela border?\nEDGARDO LANDER: Well, in the first place, I\u2019d like to insist on the fact that this certainly is not humanitarian aid, and it\u2019s not oriented with any humanitarian aims. This is clearly a coup carried out by the United States government with its allies, with the Lima Group and the extreme right wing in Venezuela. The opposition, the right-wing opposition, in Venezuela, the people who control Parliament and the opposition parties, have been weakened over the last few years, and they had not been able to agree on any single policy in relation to ways to confront the Maduro government. But now it\u2019s obvious that this very extreme right wing has been in close coordination with the United States government for some time now. And this script that has been followed since Guaid\u00f3 self-proclaimed himself as president is a script that\u2019s basically a U.S. script. And this script is on the works right now.\nThere is no concern about the situation of the Venezuelan population, because, as I said before, if you take away billions from the capacity of the government in Venezuela to respond to the needs for medicine and food, on one hand, and you offer a few million dollars in food and medicine on the Colombian border, there is no proportion whatsoever, and it\u2019s clear that the purpose is not to respond to the situation of the Venezuelan population, but to create a conflict in the border. As people have been called by the Guaid\u00f3\u2014by Guaid\u00f3 and his people to concentrate at the border, and this concert has been organized on the Colombian side of the government, this could lead to a confrontation between the two sides. The Venezuelan government has announced that it might close the border. It hasn\u2019t been decided yet. But the possibility of the closing of the border means that, as there is now\u2014there\u2019s Venezuelan military presence in this side of the border, and there\u2019s obviously all sorts of paramilitary groups, CIA representatives, members of the armed forces of Colombia on the other side. And anything could spark some violence that could lead to the beginning of a confrontation. I don\u2019t think that Saturday will be D-Day, in which a great confrontation will start, but it\u2019s a possibility that it could be the spark that could lead to increased violence and the possibility of a civil war.\nSo, we have to confront this supposedly humanitarian aid, which is not humanitarian aid. It\u2019s just direct intervention in order to have regime change, which has been the purpose of the Trump government from the very beginning. And we know what regime change has meant in other places. We know the experience of regime change in Libya. We know the experience of regime change in Iraq. We know what the people in Syria are facing today as a consequence of these imperial attempts to have regime change. So, there is no possibility that this so-called humanitarian aid will make any positive contribution to the Venezuelan situation. It\u2019s just going to make it worse, because it\u2019s deepening the crisis in terms of medicine and food for the Venezuelan people, on one hand, it\u2019s increasing the likelihood of an escalation of violence, and it\u2019s opening up the doors to the possibility of a civil war.\nSo, the need for some sort of negotiation, for putting a stop to this escalation, and to put the blame, on one hand, on Maduro\u2019s responsibility for having, throughout this six years of government, created such an incredible collapse of the Venezuelan economy\u2014today, the economy is half of what it used to be when Maduro came to power, and this is basically the government\u2019s responsibility. U.S. sanctions against Venezuela, Trump\u2019s sanctions against Venezuela, started a year and a half ago, around mid-2017. But the crisis came from way before. U.S. sanctions have deepened the crisis, but they are not the main cause of the crisis. The main cause of the crisis is ineptitude and massive corruption by the Maduro government.\nSo, we in Venezuela are faced with these two evils, with these two confronting enemies that have the Venezuelan people in between, paying for their own ineptitude, for their own violence, for their own political purpose, which are not the purposes of the Venezuelan population. We need to have some sort of pressure on the U.S. government to stop this level of intervention, this threat of military intervention. And we have to call on the Maduro government to be willing to open up a negotiation, because there are a lot of reasons why people in Venezuela don\u2019t really trust Maduro when he calls about his willingness to negotiate, because he always says the same thing. But when negotiations are always carried out, they are negotiations in which he has not been willing to do anything. He hasn\u2019t been willing to cede on any one basic issue.\nAMY GOODMAN: Edgardo Lander, I want to thank you\u2014\nEDGARDO LANDER: The Venezuela government today is\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014for being with us.

The book is titled &ldquo;Life and Death in Rikers Island.&rdquo; Dr. Homer Venters offers unprecedented insight into what happens inside prison walls to create new health risks for incarcerated men and women, including neglect, blocked access to care, physical and sexual violence, and brutality by corrections officers. Venters further reveals that when prisoners become ill, are injured or even die in custody, the facts of the incident are often obscured. We speak to Dr. Venters and Jennifer Gonnerman, staff writer for The New Yorker magazine.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> This is <em>Democracy Now!</em> I&rsquo;m Amy Goodman. His name is synonymous with all that&rsquo;s wrong with the prison system: Kalief Browder. Kalief spent three years at Rikers Island jail in New York without charge. He was a 16-year-old high school sophomore when he was detained on suspicion of stealing a backpack. Browder never pleaded guilty, was never convicted. He maintained his innocence and requested a trial, but was only offered plea deals while the trial was repeatedly delayed. He was held at Rikers Island jail for three years, beaten by guards and prisoners alike. After enduring nearly 800 days in solitary confinement and abuses, Browder was only released when the case was dismissed. He committed suicide on June 6, 2015, at his home in the Bronx. He was 22 years old. Nearly four years later, the question remains: Why did Kalief have to die? Is there something inherently wrong with incarceration that makes it a health risk, sometimes with deadly consequences?</p>\n<p>Well, a remarkable new book attempts to answer those questions as it shines a light on the health risks of imprisonment. The book is titled <em>Life and Death in Rikers Island</em>. Its author, Dr. Homer Venters, the former chief medical officer of New York City jails. He offers unprecedented insight into what happens inside prison walls to create new health risks for incarcerated men and women, including neglect, blocked access to care, physical and sexual violence, and brutality by corrections officers. Venters further reveals that when prisoners become ill or injured, or even die in custody, the facts of the incident are often obscured. He writes, quote, &ldquo;[W]e work in settings that are designed and operated to keep the truth hidden. Detainees are beaten and threatened to prevent them from telling the truth about how they are injured, health staff are pressured to lie or omit details in their own documentation, and families experience systematic abuse and humiliation during the visitation process,&rdquo; unquote. The risks of jail are disproportionately harmful for people with behavioral health problems and for people of color, Venters explains. He concludes Rikers Island must close, and suggests how that should be done.</p>\n<p>Well, Dr. Homer Venters joins us now, physician and former chief medical officer for New York City&rsquo;s Correctional Health Services. Again, his book, <em>Life and Death in Rikers Island</em>. He&rsquo;s currently senior health and justice fellow at Community Oriented Correctional Health Services and associate professor at New York University&rsquo;s College of Global Public Health. Also with us, Jennifer Gonnerman, staff writer for <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine. Her most recent <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/do-jails-kill-people\">piece</a> is a review of Dr. Venters&rsquo; book. It&rsquo;s called <em>Life and Death in Rikers Island</em>. &ldquo;Do Jails Kill People?&rdquo; is the name of her article.</p>\n<p>Welcome you both to <em>Democracy Now!</em> OK, Dr. Venters, start off talking about why you wrote this book and how Kalief Browder&rsquo;s death relates to all of this.</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> Well, early on in my time overseeing the health system in the New York City jails, it became clear that our job was not just to take care of people who were injured or address the medical problems people had, but that this system was conferring new health risks to our patients. So, our patients were getting hurt because of the way the jails were set up and run. And so, it was clear to my team and I that part of our mission had to be to use our tools as public health and epidemiology folks, as well as doctors and nurses, to document just what these health risks were and to report those out. And one of the things that over the years became clear is that those health risks, as you just stated, aren&rsquo;t meted out in a uniform fashion. People with behavioral health problems, people of color, our data show, were more likely to find themselves on the wrong end of these health risks.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Talk about why prisons are lethal. Talk about Rikers Island, for example.</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> Well, we can start with the first and most serious health risk, which is death. It&rsquo;s clear that there are many preventable, or what we would call jail-attributable, deaths that happen. We worked hard to document those while I was leading the health service in the New York City jails, but there are many others. So, for instance, people that we know who are coming in with very serious health problems&mdash;diabetes or hepatitis C or needing dialysis&mdash;who then are denied those services, despite the fact that we have them available; people who are exposed to solitary confinement, not just the isolation, but the brutality and violence associated with it, who do take extreme measures to get away from the distress that that setting causes&mdash;those are things that were conferred to those people.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Tell us the story of Carlos Mercado and Angel Ramirez.</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> So, those are two patients who, as have been publicly reported, entered into the jail system with clearly identified health problems, one with diabetes and one undergoing withdrawal. And as has been reported in the press, they both, despite having clearly communicated their problems and even having their problems elicited and understood by quite a few people in the jails, received a punishment response and a neglect response that led to their death, even though they were in a system that was able to provide them the healthcare they needed.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> So what happens to a prisoner when they&rsquo;re sick? You also talk about the tension between the doctors, the nurses&mdash;the health professionals&mdash;and the guards.</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> In the best of circumstances, the correctional officers, who are with our patients all the time&mdash;you know, they see and interact with people much more than we do in the health service&mdash;they determine that somebody is ill and they need help, or somebody just reports, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel well,&rdquo; then they&rsquo;re taken to medical care, and they get the appropriate level of medical care. They&rsquo;re transferred to the hospital if they need something that the jails can&rsquo;t provide.</p>\n<p>In the worst circumstance&mdash;and there are some situations that actually hardwire in this less ideal response&mdash;people aren&rsquo;t able to say that they&rsquo;re sick or that they feel well, or when they do, they&rsquo;re not believed, and so they&rsquo;re kept in a chaotic intake pen, or they&rsquo;re kept in a solitary confinement cell, even though they&rsquo;re saying, clearly, &ldquo;I need insulin,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just swallowed something that could kill me,&rdquo; and then they&rsquo;re denied access to healthcare.</p>\n<p>And then, finally, I would say that because of the pressure of dual loyalty, this really crushing and very omnipresent ethical problem, human rights problem, in correctional health, that even when they do make it to the health service, sometimes the doctor or nurse or social worker in front of them is acting more as an agent of the security service than as a healthcare provider.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Talk about your own experiences. You entered the jails in what? 2008?</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> About a decade ago?</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> What did you find there? What shocked you most?</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> I believe that what&mdash;one of the things that shocked me the most was the high level of injury and injury associated with violence. Certainly, all physicians and healthcare people, we have experience taking care of injuries. But so many of our patients were coming to us with injuries, and so many of them were saying that these injuries were from things called slip and falls. So, you know, patients that come with a fracture to the jaw, a very&mdash;you know, very serious injury, or a fracture of the upper arm or the leg, and then saying that they had slipped and fallen&mdash;things that just did not&mdash;you know, we didn&rsquo;t believe. But also, it was clear, when you interacted with these patients, that they were terrified and that they, actually, in that moment, were thinking very clearly about their survival and their preservation. And so, it makes a very difficult proposition for a doctor or nurse.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> So, you set up an injury surveillance system?</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> That&rsquo;s right. Shortly before I arrived, Christopher Robinson, another young man who died in that same jail that Kalief Browder was held in, he had been beaten to death. And so, when I did arrive and started with the Correctional Health Service, we set about understanding how many other people were injured, especially adolescents. And we saw lots of jaw fractures and hand fractures. And so, at first we were dealing with paper records, but then we quickly implemented in the New York City jail system an electronic medical record. But we were able to modify that in really major ways, so that we could capture data not just about the type of injury people had, but about whether or not it was intentional. Did it happen during a use of force? Was there a blow to the head? Then we could use that data to report out to others, not just in the correctional service or the city, but outside parties that might be interested, what the rates of injury were, so that we had empirical data to show that brutality and injury was in fact a real crisis for our patients.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Describe what would happen when you would send an email to the DOC, to the Department of Corrections, to upgrade an injury, to upgrade what you saw.</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> Well, the injury reporting system on the health side, as I mentioned, we built a pretty sophisticated electronic medical record system. On the security side, it required paper, pieces of paper, injury reports, to be updated and amended actually on an individual piece of paper. So, when I would find a patient, as I often would, who had an injury that was more serious than initially reported, or that the circumstances of the injury were different than was originally reported, unlike in healthcare, where we want all information to lead us to the quickest, best outcome for the patient, these paper forms then would be put back in my face, and people would say, &ldquo;Listen, you have to find the original doctor or go to the original jail. Go find this piece of paper&rdquo;&mdash;that nobody can find. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the proper way to get this addressed, not simply to tell us that, just because you&rsquo;re a doctor or a health administrator, you think something else happened.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Why is there so little transparency? Talk about the silent complicity you describe.</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> You know, these are paramilitary settings. And so, the health service, in most of these places, even when we have an independent health authority, we still rely on the correctional staff for our safety and security. And so, as such, because there isn&rsquo;t a lot of mandated transparency about health outcomes, about the true characteristics of injuries, for instance, at the time we were doing this work, most of the system is designed to keep information on the inside, so that anybody who wants to change the original account, whether it&rsquo;s a patient or a doctor or a nurse, faces a real gauntlet of challenges, that not only are bureaucratic and administrative, but actually could put their own personal safety at risk.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> We&rsquo;re going to break and then come back to this discussion and bring in Jennifer Gonnerman, who wrote the review of your piece for <i>The New Yorker</i>&mdash;the review of your book. Dr. Homer Venters&rsquo; book is called <em>Life and Death in Rikers Island</em>. Stay with us.</p>\n<p>[break]</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> &ldquo;Blue Prelude&rdquo; by Ethel Ennis, Baltimore&rsquo;s &ldquo;First Lady of Jazz.&rdquo; She passed away February 17th at the age of 86. This is <em>Democracy Now!</em>, democracynow.org, <em>The War and Peace Report</em>.</p>\n<p>I want to turn to Kalief Browder in his own words. Kalief Browder, of course, is the&mdash;well, was 16 when he was arrested and sent to Rikers Island. He ended up being there for three years, much of that time in solitary confinement, without charge. He was arrested when he was a high school sophomore. Police believed&mdash;they said that he stole a backpack, but could never come up with the person who made the accusation, who they drove around a neighbor, and the person pointed out Kalief walking on the street. And then that person just disappeared. Kalief would not plead in prison, because he said he was taught not to lie, and he said he was innocent. Held for three years, much of that time in solitary confinement. He said that while he was in solitary confinement at Rikers, the guards often refused to give him his meals.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>KALIEF BROWDER:</strong> If you say anything that could tick them off any type of way, some of them, which is a lot of them, what they do is they starve you. They won&rsquo;t feed you. And it&rsquo;s already hard in there, because if you get the three trays that you get every day, you&rsquo;re still hungry, because I guess that&rsquo;s part of the punishment. So, if they starve you one tray, that could really make an impact on you. And&mdash;</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>MARC LAMONT HILL:</strong> How much were you starved?</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>KALIEF BROWDER:</strong> I was starved a lot. I can&rsquo;t even&mdash;I can&rsquo;t even count.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> So, that was Kalief Browder speaking on <em>HuffPost Live</em>, when it was around. He died within two years after this interview. He took his own life. He went on to say he was once starved four times in a row&mdash;no breakfast, lunch, dinner or breakfast again. After enduring nearly 800 days in solitary, Browder was only released when the case was dismissed. Browder took his own life June 6, 2015, at his home in the Bronx. He was 22 years old. He was a student at Bronx Community College.</p>\n<p>Jennifer Gonnerman wrote a lot about his case for <em>The New Yorker</em> and exposed videos that were gotten from the inside of Rikers showing him being beaten by guards and prisoners alike.</p>\n<p>Jennifer, you have covered the prison system a lot. And you were really taken with this book, <em>Life and Death in Rikers Island</em>, and wrote a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/do-jails-kill-people\">review</a> of it for <em>The New Yorker</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>JENNIFER GONNERMAN:</strong> Yeah, you know, I saw an early copy of this book in December. And a lot of books come in. You know, as a reporter, you get a lot of&mdash;often get a lot of books and people who want publicity. I started reading this book, and I really couldn&rsquo;t put it down. I thought it was so important, crucially important. And I feel like it covers one of the most overlooked aspects of mass incarceration. I mean, mass incarceration has gotten a lot of attention in recent years. But what&mdash;the health risks that folks endure when they go inside is something that I feel needs much more attention. And I think, as a society, we&rsquo;ve sort of grown numb to these headlines, like an individual died in prison or jail, and we don&rsquo;t really follow up with the necessary questions. And what Dr. Venters&rsquo; book does is really pushes us to ask those harder questions, like: Did this death have to happen? Was it preventable? Did something happen in the jail that led to this individual&rsquo;s death? And those are the kind of questions the public&mdash;and journalists, in particular&mdash;really need to be asking.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Tell us the case of Ronald Spear.</p>\n<p><strong>JENNIFER GONNERMAN:</strong> Ronald Spear is one of the gentlemen in the book. He was in Rikers Island. He was in his fifties. He was a kidney dialysis patient. In 2012, one night, he felt very ill and tried to get the attention of the doctor. He was housed in the infirmary on Rikers Island. There was a medical office next door to his dorm. He snuck out of the dorm to get into the hall to get to the medical office, and the doctor told him&mdash;you know, a guard stopped him, and the doctor said, &ldquo;You have to keep waiting.&rdquo; He had been waiting for hours. The officer, the correction officer, and Mr. Spear got into an altercation, which ended with two other guards coming in and restraining him on the floor. And that would have been the end of the situation, but then the first officer, whose name is Brian Coll, came in and kicked Mr. Spear in the head repeatedly, and he died right there on the floor. This case was covered up, lied about for years, until, finally, federal prosecutors in the Southern District in Manhattan brought a prosecution against the officer. And he went on trial in 2016. So I sat through the trial. And obviously the focus was on what this officer did and didn&rsquo;t do.</p>\n<p>But one of the subtexts of that court case was what the medical staff was doing at the time. So, this crime took place in the hallway right outside the medical offices, and the nurse got on the stand and said, when she heard the altercation in the hallway, she opened her door, and then she shut her door, and that she had sort of been taught to do that. It&rsquo;s almost like an unofficial rule on Rikers Island. And the doctor who was on duty and hears all of this commotion going on in the hallway, he was sitting in his office and never looked out the window, never opened the door, testified to all of this, and only opened his door after the whole thing was over, and somebody knocked on the door&mdash;I believe it was a captain&mdash;and said, &ldquo;Can you come out here and, you know, help?&rdquo; And at that point, Mr. Spear is on the floor, in handcuffs, face down and no pulse. And so, essentially, this homicide took place within feet of the medical staff. And that always stuck with me. And, you know, this idea of an unofficial rule of averting your eyes when there&rsquo;s an altercation between correction officers and inmates is something that actually shows up in Dr. Venters&rsquo; book also.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> You say that 112 people died in New York City jails between 2010 and 2016. That&rsquo;s like almost what? Twenty a year.</p>\n<p><strong>JENNIFER GONNERMAN:</strong> More, probably, in some years, right? Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> Some years, yes.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> So, what is society&rsquo;s responsibility here?</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> I think that there are really very large policy decisions that have been made to keep these deaths and injuries hidden. And so, to undo these problems is not simply a matter of a little bit of training for one group of staff or another. It is that we have to establish medical systems that work not only to care for the patients and their health problems, but also to collect the data we do in the rest of the country, and report it out. We also need independent oversight. We&rsquo;re fortunate in New York City to have the Board of Correction, an incredibly vital institution that really doesn&rsquo;t exist in most of the other 3,000 counties in the States. But they need to be supported and the independence to make sure that the health service and the correctional service adhere to rules.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Dr. Venters, you also say Rikers should be closed.</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> Absolutely.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Is it happening fast enough?</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> Well, so, the Mayor&rsquo;s Office of Criminal Justice, led by Liz Glazer, is doing an amazing amount of work to come up with the actual planning that can make it happen. But this is a political question. To close Rikers Island, one of the&mdash;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> How many people does it imprison?</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> The jail system today has about&mdash;has under 9,000. But we really need to get down to 5,000 or so, which means building at least another borough jail.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> You write, the health risks that are faced, particularly by people with behavioral problems, in prison&mdash;talk about that.</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> Yeah, I think that the most extreme example, that&rsquo;s really an obscenity, is the notion that people who exhibit symptoms of mental health problems would be then put into solitary confinement, where we know that they&rsquo;ll get worse and often die. And so, the idea that we had a solitary confinement unit for people with mental illness in the New York City jails until 2014 is horrific. It&rsquo;s not&mdash;that&rsquo;s not a lack of resources. That&rsquo;s not a lack of thought. Thought went into it. And so, where Jason Echevarria and others died, you know, that was an affirmative decision. So, undoing those bad decisions, coming up with a more clinically appropriate, a therapeutic model, in most cases, means not having people in jail. It means having people in a community setting, that&rsquo;s an actual healthcare setting. We built alternative models in the New York City jails, these units, the CAPS and PACE units, these very therapeutic units, but they&rsquo;re incredibly expensive&mdash;couple million dollars a year for 20 patients. And every aspect of those units would be more effective if they were not in the jails.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Mass incarceration in this country has been taken on by grassroots activists now for years. And it&rsquo;s certainly reading, I think, a&mdash;reaching a tipping point, where you have people across the political spectrum saying we have the largest prison population in the world. How can this be changed?</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> I think that one of&mdash;there&rsquo;s an important voice that needs to be brought to this, which is healthcare systems, health insurance companies, because keep in mind that while most people don&rsquo;t die in jail or prison, many people are coming home with physical and psychological damage from these settings. And the care they need&mdash;which they may have struggle to access, but the care they need is going to be provided by community hospitals. Just take the example of traumatic brain injury. We documented all of the hidden traumatic brain injury just in the New York City jail systems. That increases the risk of those people for dementia and CTE down the road, that is incredibly costly to them and their families.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> How do people on the outside get access to this information on the inside, particularly families of people who are in prison?</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> So, I think that it is&mdash;these systems are designed to keep the truth from&mdash;certainly from families, who are, you know, lied to all the time. And from&mdash;but I think that it&rsquo;s incredibly important to have aggressive journalism. But also, I think that some of the structures that exist in New York City should be replicated elsewhere, so having a board of correction or an oversight agency that demands data. Having investigative journalists that dig into individual deaths is incredibly important.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Steve Coll just wrote a new <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/04/the-jail-health-care-crisis\">piece</a> in <em>The New Yorker</em>, &ldquo;The Jail Health-Care Crisis,&rdquo; talking about the opioid epidemic, among other things.</p>\n<p><strong>DR. HOMER VENTERS:</strong> Yeah, I think that that&rsquo;s a&mdash;that is also a very good example, that most jails and prisons, people don&rsquo;t have access to evidence-based addiction care. So, many people end up incarcerated because of an addiction problem. Then, because they&rsquo;re denied access to buprenorphine and methadone, they leave, and, we know&mdash;we have documented, here in New York City&mdash;their risk of death when they leave is much higher. Now, in New York City, we have a methadone program and a buprenorphine program for people who are incarcerated, but very few jails around the country have that.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And, Jennifer Gonnerman, what gives you the most hope as you continue to cover the prison-industrial complex?</p>\n<p><strong>JENNIFER GONNERMAN:</strong> Well, you know, as you were mentioning, there&rsquo;s a lot of activists that have taken up this cause, which is fantastic, because, you know, back in the '90s, the 2000s, you just didn't see that level of interest or enthusiasm in activism for taking on these really challenging topics. That gives me hope. And also folks like Dr. Venters, people who have been on the inside, who have witnessed horrific things, and then have the wherewithal and the courage and take the time to really record them, so the rest of us can really, truly get a much better understanding of what&rsquo;s going on behind bars.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And the access to information you, as a journalist, have, getting&mdash;for example, you leaked these videos of what was taking place with Kalief being beaten, the videos that are taken, the surveillance system within prison?</p>\n<p><strong>JENNIFER GONNERMAN:</strong> Right. You know, that was very unusual. You know, there is very little video footage that has come out of&mdash;from prisons around the country, despite there being a number of surveillance cameras. You know, like Dr. Venters said, the truth is hidden. It&rsquo;s intentionally hidden. It&rsquo;s very difficult&mdash;you know, reporting on what&rsquo;s going on inside of jails and prisons is very difficult. But, obviously, the more journalists who are taking on the challenge, the more we&rsquo;re going to get to the heart of what the truth is.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> I want to thank you both for being with us.

                "text": "The former chief medical officer of New York City jails has just published a remarkable new book about the health risks of incarceration. The book is titled \u201cLife and Death in Rikers Island.\u201d Dr. Homer Venters offers unprecedented insight into what happens inside prison walls to create new health risks for incarcerated men and women, including neglect, blocked access to care, physical and sexual violence, and brutality by corrections officers. Venters further reveals that when prisoners become ill, are injured or even die in custody, the facts of the incident are often obscured. We speak to Dr. Venters and Jennifer Gonnerman, staff writer for The New Yorker magazine.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! I\u2019m Amy Goodman. His name is synonymous with all that\u2019s wrong with the prison system: Kalief Browder. Kalief spent three years at Rikers Island jail in New York without charge. He was a 16-year-old high school sophomore when he was detained on suspicion of stealing a backpack. Browder never pleaded guilty, was never convicted. He maintained his innocence and requested a trial, but was only offered plea deals while the trial was repeatedly delayed. He was held at Rikers Island jail for three years, beaten by guards and prisoners alike. After enduring nearly 800 days in solitary confinement and abuses, Browder was only released when the case was dismissed. He committed suicide on June 6, 2015, at his home in the Bronx. He was 22 years old. Nearly four years later, the question remains: Why did Kalief have to die? Is there something inherently wrong with incarceration that makes it a health risk, sometimes with deadly consequences?\nWell, a remarkable new book attempts to answer those questions as it shines a light on the health risks of imprisonment. The book is titled Life and Death in Rikers Island. Its author, Dr. Homer Venters, the former chief medical officer of New York City jails. He offers unprecedented insight into what happens inside prison walls to create new health risks for incarcerated men and women, including neglect, blocked access to care, physical and sexual violence, and brutality by corrections officers. Venters further reveals that when prisoners become ill or injured, or even die in custody, the facts of the incident are often obscured. He writes, quote, \u201c[W]e work in settings that are designed and operated to keep the truth hidden. Detainees are beaten and threatened to prevent them from telling the truth about how they are injured, health staff are pressured to lie or omit details in their own documentation, and families experience systematic abuse and humiliation during the visitation process,\u201d unquote. The risks of jail are disproportionately harmful for people with behavioral health problems and for people of color, Venters explains. He concludes Rikers Island must close, and suggests how that should be done.\nWell, Dr. Homer Venters joins us now, physician and former chief medical officer for New York City\u2019s Correctional Health Services. Again, his book, Life and Death in Rikers Island. He\u2019s currently senior health and justice fellow at Community Oriented Correctional Health Services and associate professor at New York University\u2019s College of Global Public Health. Also with us, Jennifer Gonnerman, staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. Her most recent piece is a review of Dr. Venters\u2019 book. It\u2019s called Life and Death in Rikers Island. \u201cDo Jails Kill People?\u201d is the name of her article.\nWelcome you both to Democracy Now! OK, Dr. Venters, start off talking about why you wrote this book and how Kalief Browder\u2019s death relates to all of this.\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: Well, early on in my time overseeing the health system in the New York City jails, it became clear that our job was not just to take care of people who were injured or address the medical problems people had, but that this system was conferring new health risks to our patients. So, our patients were getting hurt because of the way the jails were set up and run. And so, it was clear to my team and I that part of our mission had to be to use our tools as public health and epidemiology folks, as well as doctors and nurses, to document just what these health risks were and to report those out. And one of the things that over the years became clear is that those health risks, as you just stated, aren\u2019t meted out in a uniform fashion. People with behavioral health problems, people of color, our data show, were more likely to find themselves on the wrong end of these health risks.\nAMY GOODMAN: Talk about why prisons are lethal. Talk about Rikers Island, for example.\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: Well, we can start with the first and most serious health risk, which is death. It\u2019s clear that there are many preventable, or what we would call jail-attributable, deaths that happen. We worked hard to document those while I was leading the health service in the New York City jails, but there are many others. So, for instance, people that we know who are coming in with very serious health problems\u2014diabetes or hepatitis C or needing dialysis\u2014who then are denied those services, despite the fact that we have them available; people who are exposed to solitary confinement, not just the isolation, but the brutality and violence associated with it, who do take extreme measures to get away from the distress that that setting causes\u2014those are things that were conferred to those people.\nAMY GOODMAN: Tell us the story of Carlos Mercado and Angel Ramirez.\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: So, those are two patients who, as have been publicly reported, entered into the jail system with clearly identified health problems, one with diabetes and one undergoing withdrawal. And as has been reported in the press, they both, despite having clearly communicated their problems and even having their problems elicited and understood by quite a few people in the jails, received a punishment response and a neglect response that led to their death, even though they were in a system that was able to provide them the healthcare they needed.\nAMY GOODMAN: So what happens to a prisoner when they\u2019re sick? You also talk about the tension between the doctors, the nurses\u2014the health professionals\u2014and the guards.\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: In the best of circumstances, the correctional officers, who are with our patients all the time\u2014you know, they see and interact with people much more than we do in the health service\u2014they determine that somebody is ill and they need help, or somebody just reports, \u201cI don\u2019t feel well,\u201d then they\u2019re taken to medical care, and they get the appropriate level of medical care. They\u2019re transferred to the hospital if they need something that the jails can\u2019t provide.\nIn the worst circumstance\u2014and there are some situations that actually hardwire in this less ideal response\u2014people aren\u2019t able to say that they\u2019re sick or that they feel well, or when they do, they\u2019re not believed, and so they\u2019re kept in a chaotic intake pen, or they\u2019re kept in a solitary confinement cell, even though they\u2019re saying, clearly, \u201cI need insulin,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sick,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve just swallowed something that could kill me,\u201d and then they\u2019re denied access to healthcare.\nAnd then, finally, I would say that because of the pressure of dual loyalty, this really crushing and very omnipresent ethical problem, human rights problem, in correctional health, that even when they do make it to the health service, sometimes the doctor or nurse or social worker in front of them is acting more as an agent of the security service than as a healthcare provider.\nAMY GOODMAN: Talk about your own experiences. You entered the jails in what? 2008?\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: Yes.\nAMY GOODMAN: About a decade ago?\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: Yes.\nAMY GOODMAN: What did you find there? What shocked you most?\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: I believe that what\u2014one of the things that shocked me the most was the high level of injury and injury associated with violence. Certainly, all physicians and healthcare people, we have experience taking care of injuries. But so many of our patients were coming to us with injuries, and so many of them were saying that these injuries were from things called slip and falls. So, you know, patients that come with a fracture to the jaw, a very\u2014you know, very serious injury, or a fracture of the upper arm or the leg, and then saying that they had slipped and fallen\u2014things that just did not\u2014you know, we didn\u2019t believe. But also, it was clear, when you interacted with these patients, that they were terrified and that they, actually, in that moment, were thinking very clearly about their survival and their preservation. And so, it makes a very difficult proposition for a doctor or nurse.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, you set up an injury surveillance system?\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: That\u2019s right. Shortly before I arrived, Christopher Robinson, another young man who died in that same jail that Kalief Browder was held in, he had been beaten to death. And so, when I did arrive and started with the Correctional Health Service, we set about understanding how many other people were injured, especially adolescents. And we saw lots of jaw fractures and hand fractures. And so, at first we were dealing with paper records, but then we quickly implemented in the New York City jail system an electronic medical record. But we were able to modify that in really major ways, so that we could capture data not just about the type of injury people had, but about whether or not it was intentional. Did it happen during a use of force? Was there a blow to the head? Then we could use that data to report out to others, not just in the correctional service or the city, but outside parties that might be interested, what the rates of injury were, so that we had empirical data to show that brutality and injury was in fact a real crisis for our patients.\nAMY GOODMAN: Describe what would happen when you would send an email to the DOC, to the Department of Corrections, to upgrade an injury, to upgrade what you saw.\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: Well, the injury reporting system on the health side, as I mentioned, we built a pretty sophisticated electronic medical record system. On the security side, it required paper, pieces of paper, injury reports, to be updated and amended actually on an individual piece of paper. So, when I would find a patient, as I often would, who had an injury that was more serious than initially reported, or that the circumstances of the injury were different than was originally reported, unlike in healthcare, where we want all information to lead us to the quickest, best outcome for the patient, these paper forms then would be put back in my face, and people would say, \u201cListen, you have to find the original doctor or go to the original jail. Go find this piece of paper\u201d\u2014that nobody can find. \u201cThat\u2019s the proper way to get this addressed, not simply to tell us that, just because you\u2019re a doctor or a health administrator, you think something else happened.\u201d\nAMY GOODMAN: Why is there so little transparency? Talk about the silent complicity you describe.\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: You know, these are paramilitary settings. And so, the health service, in most of these places, even when we have an independent health authority, we still rely on the correctional staff for our safety and security. And so, as such, because there isn\u2019t a lot of mandated transparency about health outcomes, about the true characteristics of injuries, for instance, at the time we were doing this work, most of the system is designed to keep information on the inside, so that anybody who wants to change the original account, whether it\u2019s a patient or a doctor or a nurse, faces a real gauntlet of challenges, that not only are bureaucratic and administrative, but actually could put their own personal safety at risk.\nAMY GOODMAN: We\u2019re going to break and then come back to this discussion and bring in Jennifer Gonnerman, who wrote the review of your piece for The New Yorker\u2014the review of your book. Dr. Homer Venters\u2019 book is called Life and Death in Rikers Island. Stay with us.\n[break]\nAMY GOODMAN: \u201cBlue Prelude\u201d by Ethel Ennis, Baltimore\u2019s \u201cFirst Lady of Jazz.\u201d She passed away February 17th at the age of 86. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.\nI want to turn to Kalief Browder in his own words. Kalief Browder, of course, is the\u2014well, was 16 when he was arrested and sent to Rikers Island. He ended up being there for three years, much of that time in solitary confinement, without charge. He was arrested when he was a high school sophomore. Police believed\u2014they said that he stole a backpack, but could never come up with the person who made the accusation, who they drove around a neighbor, and the person pointed out Kalief walking on the street. And then that person just disappeared. Kalief would not plead in prison, because he said he was taught not to lie, and he said he was innocent. Held for three years, much of that time in solitary confinement. He said that while he was in solitary confinement at Rikers, the guards often refused to give him his meals.\nKALIEF BROWDER: If you say anything that could tick them off any type of way, some of them, which is a lot of them, what they do is they starve you. They won\u2019t feed you. And it\u2019s already hard in there, because if you get the three trays that you get every day, you\u2019re still hungry, because I guess that\u2019s part of the punishment. So, if they starve you one tray, that could really make an impact on you. And\u2014\nMARC LAMONT HILL: How much were you starved?\nKALIEF BROWDER: I was starved a lot. I can\u2019t even\u2014I can\u2019t even count.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, that was Kalief Browder speaking on HuffPost Live, when it was around. He died within two years after this interview. He took his own life. He went on to say he was once starved four times in a row\u2014no breakfast, lunch, dinner or breakfast again. After enduring nearly 800 days in solitary, Browder was only released when the case was dismissed. Browder took his own life June 6, 2015, at his home in the Bronx. He was 22 years old. He was a student at Bronx Community College.\nJennifer Gonnerman wrote a lot about his case for The New Yorker and exposed videos that were gotten from the inside of Rikers showing him being beaten by guards and prisoners alike.\nJennifer, you have covered the prison system a lot. And you were really taken with this book, Life and Death in Rikers Island, and wrote a review of it for The New Yorker.\nJENNIFER GONNERMAN: Yeah, you know, I saw an early copy of this book in December. And a lot of books come in. You know, as a reporter, you get a lot of\u2014often get a lot of books and people who want publicity. I started reading this book, and I really couldn\u2019t put it down. I thought it was so important, crucially important. And I feel like it covers one of the most overlooked aspects of mass incarceration. I mean, mass incarceration has gotten a lot of attention in recent years. But what\u2014the health risks that folks endure when they go inside is something that I feel needs much more attention. And I think, as a society, we\u2019ve sort of grown numb to these headlines, like an individual died in prison or jail, and we don\u2019t really follow up with the necessary questions. And what Dr. Venters\u2019 book does is really pushes us to ask those harder questions, like: Did this death have to happen? Was it preventable? Did something happen in the jail that led to this individual\u2019s death? And those are the kind of questions the public\u2014and journalists, in particular\u2014really need to be asking.\nAMY GOODMAN: Tell us the case of Ronald Spear.\nJENNIFER GONNERMAN: Ronald Spear is one of the gentlemen in the book. He was in Rikers Island. He was in his fifties. He was a kidney dialysis patient. In 2012, one night, he felt very ill and tried to get the attention of the doctor. He was housed in the infirmary on Rikers Island. There was a medical office next door to his dorm. He snuck out of the dorm to get into the hall to get to the medical office, and the doctor told him\u2014you know, a guard stopped him, and the doctor said, \u201cYou have to keep waiting.\u201d He had been waiting for hours. The officer, the correction officer, and Mr. Spear got into an altercation, which ended with two other guards coming in and restraining him on the floor. And that would have been the end of the situation, but then the first officer, whose name is Brian Coll, came in and kicked Mr. Spear in the head repeatedly, and he died right there on the floor. This case was covered up, lied about for years, until, finally, federal prosecutors in the Southern District in Manhattan brought a prosecution against the officer. And he went on trial in 2016. So I sat through the trial. And obviously the focus was on what this officer did and didn\u2019t do.\nBut one of the subtexts of that court case was what the medical staff was doing at the time. So, this crime took place in the hallway right outside the medical offices, and the nurse got on the stand and said, when she heard the altercation in the hallway, she opened her door, and then she shut her door, and that she had sort of been taught to do that. It\u2019s almost like an unofficial rule on Rikers Island. And the doctor who was on duty and hears all of this commotion going on in the hallway, he was sitting in his office and never looked out the window, never opened the door, testified to all of this, and only opened his door after the whole thing was over, and somebody knocked on the door\u2014I believe it was a captain\u2014and said, \u201cCan you come out here and, you know, help?\u201d And at that point, Mr. Spear is on the floor, in handcuffs, face down and no pulse. And so, essentially, this homicide took place within feet of the medical staff. And that always stuck with me. And, you know, this idea of an unofficial rule of averting your eyes when there\u2019s an altercation between correction officers and inmates is something that actually shows up in Dr. Venters\u2019 book also.\nAMY GOODMAN: You say that 112 people died in New York City jails between 2010 and 2016. That\u2019s like almost what? Twenty a year.\nJENNIFER GONNERMAN: More, probably, in some years, right? Yeah.\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: Some years, yes.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, what is society\u2019s responsibility here?\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: I think that there are really very large policy decisions that have been made to keep these deaths and injuries hidden. And so, to undo these problems is not simply a matter of a little bit of training for one group of staff or another. It is that we have to establish medical systems that work not only to care for the patients and their health problems, but also to collect the data we do in the rest of the country, and report it out. We also need independent oversight. We\u2019re fortunate in New York City to have the Board of Correction, an incredibly vital institution that really doesn\u2019t exist in most of the other 3,000 counties in the States. But they need to be supported and the independence to make sure that the health service and the correctional service adhere to rules.\nAMY GOODMAN: Dr. Venters, you also say Rikers should be closed.\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: Absolutely.\nAMY GOODMAN: Is it happening fast enough?\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: Well, so, the Mayor\u2019s Office of Criminal Justice, led by Liz Glazer, is doing an amazing amount of work to come up with the actual planning that can make it happen. But this is a political question. To close Rikers Island, one of the\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: How many people does it imprison?\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: The jail system today has about\u2014has under 9,000. But we really need to get down to 5,000 or so, which means building at least another borough jail.\nAMY GOODMAN: You write, the health risks that are faced, particularly by people with behavioral problems, in prison\u2014talk about that.\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: Yeah, I think that the most extreme example, that\u2019s really an obscenity, is the notion that people who exhibit symptoms of mental health problems would be then put into solitary confinement, where we know that they\u2019ll get worse and often die. And so, the idea that we had a solitary confinement unit for people with mental illness in the New York City jails until 2014 is horrific. It\u2019s not\u2014that\u2019s not a lack of resources. That\u2019s not a lack of thought. Thought went into it. And so, where Jason Echevarria and others died, you know, that was an affirmative decision. So, undoing those bad decisions, coming up with a more clinically appropriate, a therapeutic model, in most cases, means not having people in jail. It means having people in a community setting, that\u2019s an actual healthcare setting. We built alternative models in the New York City jails, these units, the CAPS and PACE units, these very therapeutic units, but they\u2019re incredibly expensive\u2014couple million dollars a year for 20 patients. And every aspect of those units would be more effective if they were not in the jails.\nAMY GOODMAN: Mass incarceration in this country has been taken on by grassroots activists now for years. And it\u2019s certainly reading, I think, a\u2014reaching a tipping point, where you have people across the political spectrum saying we have the largest prison population in the world. How can this be changed?\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: I think that one of\u2014there\u2019s an important voice that needs to be brought to this, which is healthcare systems, health insurance companies, because keep in mind that while most people don\u2019t die in jail or prison, many people are coming home with physical and psychological damage from these settings. And the care they need\u2014which they may have struggle to access, but the care they need is going to be provided by community hospitals. Just take the example of traumatic brain injury. We documented all of the hidden traumatic brain injury just in the New York City jail systems. That increases the risk of those people for dementia and CTE down the road, that is incredibly costly to them and their families.\nAMY GOODMAN: How do people on the outside get access to this information on the inside, particularly families of people who are in prison?\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: So, I think that it is\u2014these systems are designed to keep the truth from\u2014certainly from families, who are, you know, lied to all the time. And from\u2014but I think that it\u2019s incredibly important to have aggressive journalism. But also, I think that some of the structures that exist in New York City should be replicated elsewhere, so having a board of correction or an oversight agency that demands data. Having investigative journalists that dig into individual deaths is incredibly important.\nAMY GOODMAN: Steve Coll just wrote a new piece in The New Yorker, \u201cThe Jail Health-Care Crisis,\u201d talking about the opioid epidemic, among other things.\nDR. HOMER VENTERS: Yeah, I think that that\u2019s a\u2014that is also a very good example, that most jails and prisons, people don\u2019t have access to evidence-based addiction care. So, many people end up incarcerated because of an addiction problem. Then, because they\u2019re denied access to buprenorphine and methadone, they leave, and, we know\u2014we have documented, here in New York City\u2014their risk of death when they leave is much higher. Now, in New York City, we have a methadone program and a buprenorphine program for people who are incarcerated, but very few jails around the country have that.\nAMY GOODMAN: And, Jennifer Gonnerman, what gives you the most hope as you continue to cover the prison-industrial complex?\nJENNIFER GONNERMAN: Well, you know, as you were mentioning, there\u2019s a lot of activists that have taken up this cause, which is fantastic, because, you know, back in the '90s, the 2000s, you just didn't see that level of interest or enthusiasm in activism for taking on these really challenging topics. That gives me hope. And also folks like Dr. Venters, people who have been on the inside, who have witnessed horrific things, and then have the wherewithal and the courage and take the time to really record them, so the rest of us can really, truly get a much better understanding of what\u2019s going on behind bars.\nAMY GOODMAN: And the access to information you, as a journalist, have, getting\u2014for example, you leaked these videos of what was taking place with Kalief being beaten, the videos that are taken, the surveillance system within prison?\nJENNIFER GONNERMAN: Right. You know, that was very unusual. You know, there is very little video footage that has come out of\u2014from prisons around the country, despite there being a number of surveillance cameras. You know, like Dr. Venters said, the truth is hidden. It\u2019s intentionally hidden. It\u2019s very difficult\u2014you know, reporting on what\u2019s going on inside of jails and prisons is very difficult. But, obviously, the more journalists who are taking on the challenge, the more we\u2019re going to get to the heart of what the truth is.\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you both for being with us. Dr. Homer Venters, former chief medical officer for New York City\u2019s Correctional Health Services. His new book, Life and Death in Rikers Island.

While in Syria, Hoda Muthana married a series of ISIS fighters, all of whom died in battle. Now she is living in a refugee camp in Syria with her 18-month-old son but is seeking to return to the United States, setting off a constitutional debate.

Here in the United States, the debate centers on a 24-year-old U.S.-born woman who left her family in Alabama in 2014 and moved to Syria, where she lived in the ISIS-controlled caliphate. While in Syria, Hoda Muthana married a series of ISIS fighters, all of whom died in battle. Now she&rsquo;s living in a refugee camp in Syria with her 18-month-old son. Last week, she spoke to ABC about how she first came to be a supporter of ISIS.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>HODA MUTHANA:</strong> When I was 17, I had an account on Twitter. And we were all just normal Muslims speaking together, and like we were just learning off of each other, feeding off of each other. We heard the caliphate was announced, and then we interpreted ourselves that it was obligatory upon us to go.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Hoda Muthana is now seeking to return to the United States with her son, but it&rsquo;s set off a debate that has gone all the way to the White House. Last week, President Trump tweeted, quote, &ldquo;I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!&rdquo; The Trump administration is claiming Muthana is not a U.S. citizen, even though she was born in the United States, has been issued U.S. passports. This is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaking on Fox Business.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO:</strong> This is a woman who inflicted enormous risk on American soldiers, on American citizens. She&rsquo;s a terrorist. She&rsquo;s not coming back. President Trump made clear that she wasn&rsquo;t coming back. She&rsquo;s not a U.S. citizen. She is not entitled to U.S. citizenship. And she&rsquo;s not coming back to our country to pose a threat.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> The dispute over Hoda Muthana&rsquo;s citizenship centers on her father, who was a Yemeni diplomat based in the United states, and whether he still had diplomatic status in the U.S. at the time of her birth in October of 1994. According to the Constitution, everyone born in the U.S. is granted citizenship with the exception of children of diplomats, as they don&rsquo;t fall under U.S. jurisdiction. Muthana&rsquo;s attorneys insist she does hold U.S. citizenship. She was born in Hackensack, New Jersey, October 28th, 1994, after her father had relinquished his diplomatic status more than a month before. The United States issued her a passport in 2005, renewed it in 2014. But in 2016, the Obama administration sent her a letter saying her passport was no longer valid. On Thursday, Muthana&rsquo;s family filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to allow her and her son to come back to the U.S.</p>\n<p>To find out more about the implications of Hoda&rsquo;s case, we go to Dallas, Texas, to speak with Charlie Swift, the director of the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America, an attorney for Hoda Muthana&rsquo;s father. Swift is a retired Navy officer who retired in 2007 as a lieutenant commander in the JAG Corps&mdash;that&rsquo;s the Judge Advocate General&rsquo;s Corps. He is best known for winning the U.S. Supreme Court case <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</em> for his client, Guant&aacute;namo prisoner Salim Ahmed Hamdan.</p>\n<p>Charlie Swift, welcome to <em>Democracy Now!</em> Explain the case of Hoda Muthana. Is she a U.S. citizen?</p>\n<p><strong>CHARLES SWIFT:</strong> Well, first, thank you for having me.</p>\n<p>And second, yes, she is. You&rsquo;ve hit on the pertinent facts. The 14th Amendment gives anyone born in the United States or naturalized, who are subject to jurisdiction of the courts, citizenship. Now, &ldquo;subject to jurisdiction&rdquo; was a phrase that was used for diplomats. In other words, diplomats, who have diplomatic immunity, are not subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. However, Hoda Muthana&rsquo;s father was discharged from that position. And diplomatic immunity isn&rsquo;t personal. It follows the&mdash;it is part of the position you hold. If you&rsquo;re a diplomat in a foreign country, you have it by virtue of the position that you hold having been recognized by that country, or in this country by the United States.</p>\n<p>In Hoda Muthana&rsquo;s case, Ali Muthana, her father, had been discharged on 1 September. And she wasn&rsquo;t born until the 23rd of October. And I want you to think about it this way, if you have any question. Let&rsquo;s say instead of Hoda Muthana being born on October 23rd, Ali Muthana had walked into a convenience store, held it up and shot the clerk&mdash;something he&rsquo;d never do; he&rsquo;s an incredibly law-abiding citizen. But for purposes of this, let&rsquo;s use that hypothetical. Now, let&rsquo;s seriously consider. He&rsquo;s out of his position. He&rsquo;s been discharged for more&mdash;almost 53 days. Are we going to say he has diplomatic immunity? Not a chance. It&rsquo;s not a close question. The courts have looked at this. He&rsquo;d have a reasonable period of time to leave the country, but if he had&mdash;which is generally defined as 30 days, but he hadn&rsquo;t left the country, didn&rsquo;t have any intent to leave the country. He&rsquo;s now subject to the jurisdiction of the courts, and therefore his daughter, his family, is subject to jurisdiction of the courts, and she is a citizen.</p>\n<p>And everybody thought she was a citizen. She was issued not one, but two passports. The State Department recognized that he had been&mdash;that Ali Muthana had been discharged. It wasn&rsquo;t until after she made an incredibly bad decision, one that her family has urged her against from the beginning&mdash;they didn&rsquo;t know she was leaving, but they have cooperated with authorities to try and get her back since she left&mdash;that this even came up. So, if you look at the facts, you look at the text of the Constitution, what you have here is simply ignoring the Constitution, ignoring the steps on it.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And what are the implications of this? How could this expand? Explain what could happen in other cases if someone&rsquo;s outside the country. Does this mean, at this point, since they&rsquo;ve pulled her passport, she cannot return to the United States?</p>\n<p><strong>CHARLES SWIFT:</strong> It does mean that. She doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to travel. So, one of the reasons we&rsquo;re going to court is to get the&mdash;is to seek the court to aid her in her return. The Supreme Court said that any U.S. citizen has the right to re-enter. That&rsquo;s an absolute. And citizenship can only be lost under very limited circumstances, and it&rsquo;s always a judicial matter. It can&rsquo;t be done by the executive simply saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a citizen anymore.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And the implications are tremendous. First part, if you&rsquo;re comfortable with what&rsquo;s happened to her, imagine another U.S. citizen is outside the country saying and doing things that the United States doesn&rsquo;t like, so they to say, &ldquo;You know what? We don&rsquo;t believe her birth certificate, or his birth certificate. We question it. We&rsquo;re sending you a letter saying I don&rsquo;t think your birth certificate was valid, you&rsquo;re revoked, you can&rsquo;t come back. And by the way, you can&rsquo;t come to a court here because your passport has been revoked. You can&rsquo;t come back into the United States. We&rsquo;ve closed the door.&rdquo; The implications are significant. And in fact, we&rsquo;ve been hearing at the center about these very same letters being used for persons who were born in the United States to midwives, but we&rsquo;re now revoking their citizenship by letter.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> I want to go back to Hoda Muthana speaking to ABC&rsquo;s James Longman earlier this month.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>JAMES LONGMAN:</strong> Do you feel shame when you hear that back?</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>HODA MUTHANA:</strong> Very much, yeah.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>JAMES LONGMAN:</strong> What you think would be a kind of a normal thing&mdash;</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>HODA MUTHANA:</strong> Maybe therapy lessons. Maybe a process that will ensure us that we&rsquo;ll never do this again. Jail time? I don&rsquo;t know if that has an effect on people.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>JAMES LONGMAN:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve quite grasped how awful ISIS was to the communities, the Yazidi women that were enslaved, the men and women who were accused of being homosexual who were pushed off buildings. Do you feel regret and sorrow and remorse for being part of an organization like ISIS?</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>HODA MUTHANA:</strong> Definitely. It&rsquo;s not Islamic at all. I believe that 100 percent.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> So that&rsquo;s Hoda Muthana speaking on ABC.</p>\n<p><strong>CHARLES SWIFT:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Charles Swift, talk about her story. Talk about why Hoda left this country, about her wanting to join ISIS, going to Syria, marrying three different ISIS fighters, as they died, having this son. Why did she join ISIS?</p>\n<p><strong>CHARLES SWIFT:</strong> You know, I don&rsquo;t have an answer to that. Her parents don&rsquo;t have an answer to that, in the process in it. For me, the issues here are constitutional&mdash;the revocation of citizenship, which the Supreme Court has said is never a valid punishment. So I look at that part.</p>\n<p>I think it&rsquo;s noteworthy, though. Hoda Muthana may hope that she doesn&rsquo;t get punished or get jail time. I&rsquo;ve been a criminal defense attorney for most of my life, as well as working on civil rights, and all of my clients hope they won&rsquo;t go to jail. I would say, though, that one of the things that she&rsquo;s doing by pursuing to come back here is making herself eligible to go to jail. She puts herself in&mdash;by filing the suit, the defense to her actions&mdash;the best defense on going over is that she wasn&rsquo;t a U.S. citizen. Almost all the statutes under which&mdash;I think all of the statutes under which she could be charged all require, for extraterritoriality, that the crime either originate in the United States or that she be a U.S. citizen. And since the crime didn&rsquo;t occur 'til she got over there, and if she's not a U.S. citizen, there would be no jurisdiction to try her for the criminal offenses. By establishing her citizenship, she actually makes herself eligible for trial and punishment, something&mdash;you know, her parents are fully aware of that. Her father is fully aware of it. And he thinks that she should face justice. And if she&rsquo;s convicted of something, she should serve the time for it. But he also believes that his grandson and she are still citizens and should be able to return.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> I wanted to read one of her inflammatory tweets, when she was in Syria. She wrote, &ldquo;Americans wake up! Men and women altogether. You have much to do while you live under our greatest enemy, enough of your sleeping! Go on drive-bys and spill all of their blood, or rent a big truck and drive all over them. Veterans, Patriot, Memorial etc Day &hellip; Kill them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>CHARLES SWIFT:</strong> Yep. And a question is whether that&rsquo;s criminal or not. But my concern is if you strip your citizenship for it. See, there&rsquo;s a very strong idea, this is&mdash;that plays in over time, that if you&rsquo;re disloyal to the country, then you should lose your citizenship. That&rsquo;s how the British approach it. It&rsquo;s not how the United States approaches it, because we&rsquo;ve had this absolute belief in free speech. Speech can become criminal. You can be punished for it. But we&rsquo;ve never stripped citizenship.</p>\n<p>So, I&rsquo;d like to change that a little. What if the administration later on says that anyone who does not support the current administration is creating treason, that their speech is hurting America, and we&rsquo;re going to strip you of citizenship for it? The 14th Amendment is absolute. If you&rsquo;re going to strip somebody based on their words, where&rsquo;s your line, Amy? Where&rsquo;s your line?</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Well, let&rsquo;s turn&mdash;</p>\n<p><strong>CHARLES SWIFT:</strong> See, this issues here&mdash;this is the problem. The issues are always bigger than the person. The issues weren&rsquo;t Miranda&rsquo;s guilt. The issues here are the constitutional&mdash;our constitutional foundations. And how we treat Hoda Muthana says a great deal about who we are as a nation. We don&rsquo;t strip citizenship. No one, at least in her family and whatnot, is saying it doesn&rsquo;t deserve criminal prosecution. And I think we&rsquo;re conflating the two, as somehow she comes back and doesn&rsquo;t get prosecuted. She may hope that she&rsquo;s not prosecuted. Again, I have yet to meet a criminal defendant who was extraordinarily excited about that prospect. But in choosing to return, she chooses prosecution.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Well, I&rsquo;d like to turn to Hoda Muthana again, responding to Mike Pompeo&rsquo;s claim that she&rsquo;s not a U.S. citizen. She was interviewed in Syria by NBC&rsquo;s Richard Engel.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>HODA MUTHANA:</strong> I read the papers, and I know, in fact, that I was a citizen. And when I tried filing for a passport, it was very easy. It came in 10 days. So, I thought I didn&rsquo;t have a problem. And I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s no problem. And I know my lawyer, hopefully, is working on it, and he will win the case.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>RICHARD ENGEL:</strong> Do you think you&rsquo;ll be able to go back to the United States? Do you want to go to the United States?</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>HODA MUTHANA:</strong> I&rsquo;d prefer America other than anywhere else, yeah.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>RICHARD ENGEL:</strong> And what do you&mdash;what do you want to do, if you went back to the States? What do you think will happen to you, if you were allowed to go back?</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>HODA MUTHANA:</strong> Of course, I&rsquo;ll be given jail time.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> So that&rsquo;s Hoda Muthana, who is saying she does expect she would be given jail time.</p>\n<p><strong>CHARLES SWIFT:</strong> Yeah, yeah. I would think it&rsquo;s very important to separate hopes and expectations in this process, Amy, is that&mdash;you know, as I said, everybody hopes that they&rsquo;re not going to go to jail for very long. Her expectation is that she will go to jail. And the reason, among all things, both the family and for Hoda, is the 18-month-old son, who is a U.S. citizen by virtue of birth to her. Hoda has used the words, to her family, that she has ruined her life, she doesn&rsquo;t want to ruin his.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Shamima Begum is in a similar situation. Her citizenship was revoked by the U.K. She fled to Syria from London when she was 15. Your response to the two?</p>\n<p><strong>CHARLES SWIFT:</strong> Well, she&rsquo;s in a similar situation until we get to what country she&rsquo;s from&mdash;the British and the Americans. Now, I&rsquo;m very, very&mdash;I like the British, but I&rsquo;m very proud to be an American. And at the time of our founding and afterwards, we put in place a Constitution because of the very types of abuses that we thought were wrong in Britain. Britain threw around the word &ldquo;treason&rdquo; too easily. It stripped citizenship. It banished people. That&rsquo;s what it did. That was part of its government&rsquo;s system. The Founding Fathers of the United States were having none of that. We set up a constitutional republic under the Constitution. We don&rsquo;t swear allegiance to a queen. We swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States of America. And the Constitution here is clear. The Constitution is not for bright, sunny days. It&rsquo;s for rainy ones. It&rsquo;s for the unpopular. The popular don&rsquo;t need it.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Well, Charlie Swift, we want to thank you for being with us, the attorney for Hoda Muthana&rsquo;s family. He is the director of the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America.</p>\n<p><strong>CHARLES SWIFT:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> He happens to be speaking to us today from Dallas, Texas.

While in Syria, Hoda Muthana married a series of ISIS fighters, all of whom died in battle. Now she is living in a refugee camp in Syria with her 18-month-old son but is seeking to return to the United States, setting off a constitutional debate.

Here in the United States, the debate centers on a 24-year-old U.S.-born woman who left her family in Alabama in 2014 and moved to Syria, where she lived in the ISIS-controlled caliphate. While in Syria, Hoda Muthana married a series of ISIS fighters, all of whom died in battle. Now she\u2019s living in a refugee camp in Syria with her 18-month-old son. Last week, she spoke to ABC about how she first came to be a supporter of ISIS.\nHODA MUTHANA: When I was 17, I had an account on Twitter. And we were all just normal Muslims speaking together, and like we were just learning off of each other, feeding off of each other. We heard the caliphate was announced, and then we interpreted ourselves that it was obligatory upon us to go.\nAMY GOODMAN: Hoda Muthana is now seeking to return to the United States with her son, but it\u2019s set off a debate that has gone all the way to the White House. Last week, President Trump tweeted, quote, \u201cI have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!\u201d The Trump administration is claiming Muthana is not a U.S. citizen, even though she was born in the United States, has been issued U.S. passports. This is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaking on Fox Business.\nSECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO: This is a woman who inflicted enormous risk on American soldiers, on American citizens. She\u2019s a terrorist. She\u2019s not coming back. President Trump made clear that she wasn\u2019t coming back. She\u2019s not a U.S. citizen. She is not entitled to U.S. citizenship. And she\u2019s not coming back to our country to pose a threat.\nAMY GOODMAN: The dispute over Hoda Muthana\u2019s citizenship centers on her father, who was a Yemeni diplomat based in the United states, and whether he still had diplomatic status in the U.S. at the time of her birth in October of 1994. According to the Constitution, everyone born in the U.S. is granted citizenship with the exception of children of diplomats, as they don\u2019t fall under U.S. jurisdiction. Muthana\u2019s attorneys insist she does hold U.S. citizenship. She was born in Hackensack, New Jersey, October 28th, 1994, after her father had relinquished his diplomatic status more than a month before. The United States issued her a passport in 2005, renewed it in 2014. But in 2016, the Obama administration sent her a letter saying her passport was no longer valid. On Thursday, Muthana\u2019s family filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to allow her and her son to come back to the U.S.\nTo find out more about the implications of Hoda\u2019s case, we go to Dallas, Texas, to speak with Charlie Swift, the director of the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America, an attorney for Hoda Muthana\u2019s father. Swift is a retired Navy officer who retired in 2007 as a lieutenant commander in the JAG Corps\u2014that\u2019s the Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps. He is best known for winning the U.S. Supreme Court case Hamdan v. Rumsfeld for his client, Guant\u00e1namo prisoner Salim Ahmed Hamdan.\nCharlie Swift, welcome to Democracy Now! Explain the case of Hoda Muthana. Is she a U.S. citizen?\nCHARLES SWIFT: Well, first, thank you for having me.\nAnd second, yes, she is. You\u2019ve hit on the pertinent facts. The 14th Amendment gives anyone born in the United States or naturalized, who are subject to jurisdiction of the courts, citizenship. Now, \u201csubject to jurisdiction\u201d was a phrase that was used for diplomats. In other words, diplomats, who have diplomatic immunity, are not subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. However, Hoda Muthana\u2019s father was discharged from that position. And diplomatic immunity isn\u2019t personal. It follows the\u2014it is part of the position you hold. If you\u2019re a diplomat in a foreign country, you have it by virtue of the position that you hold having been recognized by that country, or in this country by the United States.\nIn Hoda Muthana\u2019s case, Ali Muthana, her father, had been discharged on 1 September. And she wasn\u2019t born until the 23rd of October. And I want you to think about it this way, if you have any question. Let\u2019s say instead of Hoda Muthana being born on October 23rd, Ali Muthana had walked into a convenience store, held it up and shot the clerk\u2014something he\u2019d never do; he\u2019s an incredibly law-abiding citizen. But for purposes of this, let\u2019s use that hypothetical. Now, let\u2019s seriously consider. He\u2019s out of his position. He\u2019s been discharged for more\u2014almost 53 days. Are we going to say he has diplomatic immunity? Not a chance. It\u2019s not a close question. The courts have looked at this. He\u2019d have a reasonable period of time to leave the country, but if he had\u2014which is generally defined as 30 days, but he hadn\u2019t left the country, didn\u2019t have any intent to leave the country. He\u2019s now subject to the jurisdiction of the courts, and therefore his daughter, his family, is subject to jurisdiction of the courts, and she is a citizen.\nAnd everybody thought she was a citizen. She was issued not one, but two passports. The State Department recognized that he had been\u2014that Ali Muthana had been discharged. It wasn\u2019t until after she made an incredibly bad decision, one that her family has urged her against from the beginning\u2014they didn\u2019t know she was leaving, but they have cooperated with authorities to try and get her back since she left\u2014that this even came up. So, if you look at the facts, you look at the text of the Constitution, what you have here is simply ignoring the Constitution, ignoring the steps on it.\nAMY GOODMAN: And what are the implications of this? How could this expand? Explain what could happen in other cases if someone\u2019s outside the country. Does this mean, at this point, since they\u2019ve pulled her passport, she cannot return to the United States?\nCHARLES SWIFT: It does mean that. She doesn\u2019t have the ability to travel. So, one of the reasons we\u2019re going to court is to get the\u2014is to seek the court to aid her in her return. The Supreme Court said that any U.S. citizen has the right to re-enter. That\u2019s an absolute. And citizenship can only be lost under very limited circumstances, and it\u2019s always a judicial matter. It can\u2019t be done by the executive simply saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not a citizen anymore.\u201d\nAnd the implications are tremendous. First part, if you\u2019re comfortable with what\u2019s happened to her, imagine another U.S. citizen is outside the country saying and doing things that the United States doesn\u2019t like, so they to say, \u201cYou know what? We don\u2019t believe her birth certificate, or his birth certificate. We question it. We\u2019re sending you a letter saying I don\u2019t think your birth certificate was valid, you\u2019re revoked, you can\u2019t come back. And by the way, you can\u2019t come to a court here because your passport has been revoked. You can\u2019t come back into the United States. We\u2019ve closed the door.\u201d The implications are significant. And in fact, we\u2019ve been hearing at the center about these very same letters being used for persons who were born in the United States to midwives, but we\u2019re now revoking their citizenship by letter.\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to go back to Hoda Muthana speaking to ABC\u2019s James Longman earlier this month.\nJAMES LONGMAN: Do you feel shame when you hear that back?\nHODA MUTHANA: Very much, yeah.\nJAMES LONGMAN: What you think would be a kind of a normal thing\u2014\nHODA MUTHANA: Maybe therapy lessons. Maybe a process that will ensure us that we\u2019ll never do this again. Jail time? I don\u2019t know if that has an effect on people.\nJAMES LONGMAN: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve quite grasped how awful ISIS was to the communities, the Yazidi women that were enslaved, the men and women who were accused of being homosexual who were pushed off buildings. Do you feel regret and sorrow and remorse for being part of an organization like ISIS?\nHODA MUTHANA: Definitely. It\u2019s not Islamic at all. I believe that 100 percent.\nAMY GOODMAN: So that\u2019s Hoda Muthana speaking on ABC.\nCHARLES SWIFT: Yes.\nAMY GOODMAN: Charles Swift, talk about her story. Talk about why Hoda left this country, about her wanting to join ISIS, going to Syria, marrying three different ISIS fighters, as they died, having this son. Why did she join ISIS?\nCHARLES SWIFT: You know, I don\u2019t have an answer to that. Her parents don\u2019t have an answer to that, in the process in it. For me, the issues here are constitutional\u2014the revocation of citizenship, which the Supreme Court has said is never a valid punishment. So I look at that part.\nI think it\u2019s noteworthy, though. Hoda Muthana may hope that she doesn\u2019t get punished or get jail time. I\u2019ve been a criminal defense attorney for most of my life, as well as working on civil rights, and all of my clients hope they won\u2019t go to jail. I would say, though, that one of the things that she\u2019s doing by pursuing to come back here is making herself eligible to go to jail. She puts herself in\u2014by filing the suit, the defense to her actions\u2014the best defense on going over is that she wasn\u2019t a U.S. citizen. Almost all the statutes under which\u2014I think all of the statutes under which she could be charged all require, for extraterritoriality, that the crime either originate in the United States or that she be a U.S. citizen. And since the crime didn\u2019t occur 'til she got over there, and if she's not a U.S. citizen, there would be no jurisdiction to try her for the criminal offenses. By establishing her citizenship, she actually makes herself eligible for trial and punishment, something\u2014you know, her parents are fully aware of that. Her father is fully aware of it. And he thinks that she should face justice. And if she\u2019s convicted of something, she should serve the time for it. But he also believes that his grandson and she are still citizens and should be able to return.\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to read one of her inflammatory tweets, when she was in Syria. She wrote, \u201cAmericans wake up! Men and women altogether. You have much to do while you live under our greatest enemy, enough of your sleeping! Go on drive-bys and spill all of their blood, or rent a big truck and drive all over them. Veterans, Patriot, Memorial etc Day \u2026 Kill them.\u201d\nCHARLES SWIFT: Yep. And a question is whether that\u2019s criminal or not. But my concern is if you strip your citizenship for it. See, there\u2019s a very strong idea, this is\u2014that plays in over time, that if you\u2019re disloyal to the country, then you should lose your citizenship. That\u2019s how the British approach it. It\u2019s not how the United States approaches it, because we\u2019ve had this absolute belief in free speech. Speech can become criminal. You can be punished for it. But we\u2019ve never stripped citizenship.\nSo, I\u2019d like to change that a little. What if the administration later on says that anyone who does not support the current administration is creating treason, that their speech is hurting America, and we\u2019re going to strip you of citizenship for it? The 14th Amendment is absolute. If you\u2019re going to strip somebody based on their words, where\u2019s your line, Amy? Where\u2019s your line?\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, let\u2019s turn\u2014\nCHARLES SWIFT: See, this issues here\u2014this is the problem. The issues are always bigger than the person. The issues weren\u2019t Miranda\u2019s guilt. The issues here are the constitutional\u2014our constitutional foundations. And how we treat Hoda Muthana says a great deal about who we are as a nation. We don\u2019t strip citizenship. No one, at least in her family and whatnot, is saying it doesn\u2019t deserve criminal prosecution. And I think we\u2019re conflating the two, as somehow she comes back and doesn\u2019t get prosecuted. She may hope that she\u2019s not prosecuted. Again, I have yet to meet a criminal defendant who was extraordinarily excited about that prospect. But in choosing to return, she chooses prosecution.\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, I\u2019d like to turn to Hoda Muthana again, responding to Mike Pompeo\u2019s claim that she\u2019s not a U.S. citizen. She was interviewed in Syria by NBC\u2019s Richard Engel.\nHODA MUTHANA: I read the papers, and I know, in fact, that I was a citizen. And when I tried filing for a passport, it was very easy. It came in 10 days. So, I thought I didn\u2019t have a problem. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no problem. And I know my lawyer, hopefully, is working on it, and he will win the case.\nRICHARD ENGEL: Do you think you\u2019ll be able to go back to the United States? Do you want to go to the United States?\nHODA MUTHANA: I\u2019d prefer America other than anywhere else, yeah.\nRICHARD ENGEL: And what do you\u2014what do you want to do, if you went back to the States? What do you think will happen to you, if you were allowed to go back?\nHODA MUTHANA: Of course, I\u2019ll be given jail time.\nAMY GOODMAN: So that\u2019s Hoda Muthana, who is saying she does expect she would be given jail time.\nCHARLES SWIFT: Yeah, yeah. I would think it\u2019s very important to separate hopes and expectations in this process, Amy, is that\u2014you know, as I said, everybody hopes that they\u2019re not going to go to jail for very long. Her expectation is that she will go to jail. And the reason, among all things, both the family and for Hoda, is the 18-month-old son, who is a U.S. citizen by virtue of birth to her. Hoda has used the words, to her family, that she has ruined her life, she doesn\u2019t want to ruin his.\nAMY GOODMAN: Shamima Begum is in a similar situation. Her citizenship was revoked by the U.K. She fled to Syria from London when she was 15. Your response to the two?\nCHARLES SWIFT: Well, she\u2019s in a similar situation until we get to what country she\u2019s from\u2014the British and the Americans. Now, I\u2019m very, very\u2014I like the British, but I\u2019m very proud to be an American. And at the time of our founding and afterwards, we put in place a Constitution because of the very types of abuses that we thought were wrong in Britain. Britain threw around the word \u201ctreason\u201d too easily. It stripped citizenship. It banished people. That\u2019s what it did. That was part of its government\u2019s system. The Founding Fathers of the United States were having none of that. We set up a constitutional republic under the Constitution. We don\u2019t swear allegiance to a queen. We swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States of America. And the Constitution here is clear. The Constitution is not for bright, sunny days. It\u2019s for rainy ones. It\u2019s for the unpopular. The popular don\u2019t need it.\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, Charlie Swift, we want to thank you for being with us, the attorney for Hoda Muthana\u2019s family. He is the director of the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America.\nCHARLES SWIFT: Thank you.\nAMY GOODMAN: He happens to be speaking to us today from Dallas, Texas. This is Democracy Now! When we come back, Life and Death in Rikers Island. We look at the\u2014well, the story of thousands of people who die in American jails every year.

As a longtime senator from Delaware, Biden has previously run twice for the Democratic nomination. The last time was in 2008, when he ultimately became then-Senator Barack Obama&rsquo;s running mate. While a new campaign would seek to capitalize on Biden&rsquo;s two terms as vice president, it would also invite scrutiny of his Senate record in a Democratic political climate that is notably more progressive today than it was when Biden last sought the nomination. We speak with Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for Harper&rsquo;s magazine. His latest piece is headlined &ldquo;No Joe! Joe Biden&rsquo;s disastrous legislative legacy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> This is <em>Democracy Now!</em> I&rsquo;m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz&aacute;lez.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> Well, speculation is mounting that former Vice President Joe Biden will soon enter the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. On Tuesday, he addressed the International Association of Fire Fighters in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>JOE BIDEN:</strong> I appreciate the energy you showed when I got up here. Save it a little longer. I may need it in a few weeks. &hellip; Be careful what you wish for.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> Well, to talk more about Biden, we go now to Washington, D.C., to talk to Washington editor for <em>Harper&rsquo;s</em> magazine, Andrew Cockburn. His latest <a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/2019/03/joe-biden-record/\">piece</a> for <em>Harper&rsquo;s</em> is headlined &ldquo;No Joe! Joe Biden&rsquo;s disastrous legislative legacy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Welcome back to <em>Democracy Now!</em> Andrew, talk to us about his legacy.</p>\n<p><strong>ANDREW COCKBURN:</strong> Well, it is, as the title of my piece&mdash;subtitle of my piece indicates, it&rsquo;s pretty disastrous. I mean, going back to the beginning, he really&mdash;his most sort of active cause, when he first got into the Senate in the 1970s, was to be a fierce opponent of busing, you know, the effort to integrate schools, which was the main&mdash;it was the main effort to integrate schools across the U.S., particularly in the North. And Joe Biden was a vociferous opponent of that, introduced legislation to weaken it. And he said he had made it comfortable for liberals basically to oppose busing. So, that was rather shocking.</p>\n<p>Then he went on, and his next major initiative, throughout the '80s and into the &rsquo;90s, was on being tough on crime. He would&mdash;excuse me, sorry&mdash;he would argue fiercely for tougher sentences, and he teamed up, unbelievably, with Strom Thurmond, who was a sort of archsegregationist who had run on a Dixiecrat ticket in 1948. And with this aging racist, he fought to increase sentences for everything. Particularly, he introduced&mdash;tried to introduce 51&mdash;count them, 51&mdash;new categories of death penalty. And he&mdash;you know, the disparity, the notorious disparity, between crack cocaine, as used by black consumers, and powder cocaine, as used by white people, a, you know, just shocking sentence disparity&mdash;he was right behind Bill Clinton for the 1994 Crime Control Act, which basically incarcerated a whole generation of young black people. And, of course, if we discuss his electability, black people well remember that. So, it's been pretty shocking all the way down.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Can you talk about Anita Hill?</p>\n<p><strong>ANDREW COCKBURN:</strong> Well, yes. I mean, that&rsquo;s the one&mdash;amid a sort of long litany of disasters, that&rsquo;s the one that people tend to remember, and quite rightly so. I mean, Anita Hill reluctantly came forward to talk about Clarence Thomas&rsquo;s rather warped record on sexual harassment, and Biden didn&rsquo;t want to call her. He basically threw her under the bus. He refused to call witnesses that would have backed up her testimony. It was clear that he was really concerned about his own reputation, and he didn&rsquo;t care much for Anita Hill&rsquo;s. And as a result, you know, we were saddled with Clarence Thomas for as long as he feels like serving, this extremely right-wing justice.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> And Joe Biden&rsquo;s role in eliminating bankruptcy by students on student debt?</p>\n<p><strong>ANDREW COCKBURN:</strong> Well, he&mdash;yes, he made it impossible for students really to get out of crushing student debt through bankruptcy. I mean, on bankruptcy, of course, he&rsquo;s been&mdash;his major role has been as the errand boys for the banks&mdash;errand boy for the banks and credit card companies, who have been his major donors throughout his career. And, of course, he represents Delaware, which is the sort of Cayman Island&mdash;our onshore version of the Cayman Islands, which is really ruled by the banks and, you know, the financial industry. And, you know, interesting, of course, that although he&rsquo;s done them such faithful service over the years, he tends not to talk about that very much. Elizabeth Warren, a long time ago, rather waspishly pointed out that he didn&rsquo;t talk about his relationship with these&mdash;among his many boasts on his website, there&rsquo;s not much to read about his relationship with the credit card companies.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> We only have 30 seconds, but how would you evaluate his role as vice president under President Obama?</p>\n<p><strong>ANDREW COCKBURN:</strong> Well, very, very disappointing. For example, he did absolutely nothing to&mdash;I mean, people were outraged that the perpetrators of the 2008 crash got off scot-free, essentially&mdash;well, better than scot-free, with enormous sums of enormous bonuses. His replacement in the Senate, Ted Kaufman, tried to introduce a bill to break up the banks. He got no support from Joe Biden. His record on foreign policy under Biden was equally disastrous. He basically, you know, helped cause the installation or maintained a government in Iraq which was viciously sectarian and corrupt, which had a lot to do with the rise of ISIS.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Andrew Cockburn, we have to end the show, but we are going to do Part 2 and post it online at democracynow.org. Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for <em>Harper&rsquo;s</em> magazine. We&rsquo;ll link to his latest <a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/2019/03/joe-biden-record/\">piece</a>, &ldquo;No Joe!

As a longtime senator from Delaware, Biden has previously run twice for the Democratic nomination. The last time was in 2008, when he ultimately became then-Senator Barack Obama\u2019s running mate. While a new campaign would seek to capitalize on Biden\u2019s two terms as vice president, it would also invite scrutiny of his Senate record in a Democratic political climate that is notably more progressive today than it was when Biden last sought the nomination. We speak with Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for Harper\u2019s magazine. His latest piece is headlined \u201cNo Joe! Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous legislative legacy.\u201d\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Well, speculation is mounting that former Vice President Joe Biden will soon enter the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. On Tuesday, he addressed the International Association of Fire Fighters in Washington, D.C.\nJOE BIDEN: I appreciate the energy you showed when I got up here. Save it a little longer. I may need it in a few weeks. \u2026 Be careful what you wish for.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Well, to talk more about Biden, we go now to Washington, D.C., to talk to Washington editor for Harper\u2019s magazine, Andrew Cockburn. His latest piece for Harper\u2019s is headlined \u201cNo Joe! Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous legislative legacy.\u201d\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! Andrew, talk to us about his legacy.\nANDREW COCKBURN: Well, it is, as the title of my piece\u2014subtitle of my piece indicates, it\u2019s pretty disastrous. I mean, going back to the beginning, he really\u2014his most sort of active cause, when he first got into the Senate in the 1970s, was to be a fierce opponent of busing, you know, the effort to integrate schools, which was the main\u2014it was the main effort to integrate schools across the U.S., particularly in the North. And Joe Biden was a vociferous opponent of that, introduced legislation to weaken it. And he said he had made it comfortable for liberals basically to oppose busing. So, that was rather shocking.\nThen he went on, and his next major initiative, throughout the '80s and into the \u201990s, was on being tough on crime. He would\u2014excuse me, sorry\u2014he would argue fiercely for tougher sentences, and he teamed up, unbelievably, with Strom Thurmond, who was a sort of archsegregationist who had run on a Dixiecrat ticket in 1948. And with this aging racist, he fought to increase sentences for everything. Particularly, he introduced\u2014tried to introduce 51\u2014count them, 51\u2014new categories of death penalty. And he\u2014you know, the disparity, the notorious disparity, between crack cocaine, as used by black consumers, and powder cocaine, as used by white people, a, you know, just shocking sentence disparity\u2014he was right behind Bill Clinton for the 1994 Crime Control Act, which basically incarcerated a whole generation of young black people. And, of course, if we discuss his electability, black people well remember that. So, it's been pretty shocking all the way down.\nAMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about Anita Hill?\nANDREW COCKBURN: Well, yes. I mean, that\u2019s the one\u2014amid a sort of long litany of disasters, that\u2019s the one that people tend to remember, and quite rightly so. I mean, Anita Hill reluctantly came forward to talk about Clarence Thomas\u2019s rather warped record on sexual harassment, and Biden didn\u2019t want to call her. He basically threw her under the bus. He refused to call witnesses that would have backed up her testimony. It was clear that he was really concerned about his own reputation, and he didn\u2019t care much for Anita Hill\u2019s. And as a result, you know, we were saddled with Clarence Thomas for as long as he feels like serving, this extremely right-wing justice.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And Joe Biden\u2019s role in eliminating bankruptcy by students on student debt?\nANDREW COCKBURN: Well, he\u2014yes, he made it impossible for students really to get out of crushing student debt through bankruptcy. I mean, on bankruptcy, of course, he\u2019s been\u2014his major role has been as the errand boys for the banks\u2014errand boy for the banks and credit card companies, who have been his major donors throughout his career. And, of course, he represents Delaware, which is the sort of Cayman Island\u2014our onshore version of the Cayman Islands, which is really ruled by the banks and, you know, the financial industry. And, you know, interesting, of course, that although he\u2019s done them such faithful service over the years, he tends not to talk about that very much. Elizabeth Warren, a long time ago, rather waspishly pointed out that he didn\u2019t talk about his relationship with these\u2014among his many boasts on his website, there\u2019s not much to read about his relationship with the credit card companies.\nAMY GOODMAN: We only have 30 seconds, but how would you evaluate his role as vice president under President Obama?\nANDREW COCKBURN: Well, very, very disappointing. For example, he did absolutely nothing to\u2014I mean, people were outraged that the perpetrators of the 2008 crash got off scot-free, essentially\u2014well, better than scot-free, with enormous sums of enormous bonuses. His replacement in the Senate, Ted Kaufman, tried to introduce a bill to break up the banks. He got no support from Joe Biden. His record on foreign policy under Biden was equally disastrous. He basically, you know, helped cause the installation or maintained a government in Iraq which was viciously sectarian and corrupt, which had a lot to do with the rise of ISIS.\nAMY GOODMAN: Andrew Cockburn, we have to end the show, but we are going to do Part 2 and post it online at democracynow.org. Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for Harper\u2019s magazine. We\u2019ll link to his latest piece, \u201cNo Joe! Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous legislative legacy.\u201d\nI\u2019ll be speaking in Denver, Colorado, on March 15th, Friday night, 7, at East High School. Check democracynow.org.

The terrorist attack unfolded during Friday prayer, when a lone gunman and avid white supremacist opened fire on worshipers while live-streaming the attack on Facebook. It was the deadliest shooting in the country&rsquo;s modern history. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described Friday as one of New Zealand&rsquo;s darkest days and vowed to change the country&rsquo;s gun laws.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>PRIME MINISTER JACINDA ARDERN:</strong> The terror attack in Christchurch on Friday was the worst act of terrorism on our shores. It was in fact one of the worst globally in recent times. It has exposed a range of weaknesses in New Zealand&rsquo;s gun laws. The clear lesson from history around the world is that to make our communities safer, the time to act is now.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Police have arrested and charged a 28-year-old Australian man named Brenton Tarrant, an anti-immigrant white supremacist who published a manifesto in which he praised President Donald Trump as a &ldquo;symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose,&rdquo; unquote. But Trump has refused to acknowledge the global rise of white nationalism in the wake of the attack, saying, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems, I guess,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>In New Zealand, the Muslim community is mourning the dead, the youngest among them 3 years old. Mucad Ibrahim was murdered after being separated from his brother and father in the chaos at the Al Noor Mosque.</p>\n<p>The terror began in the early afternoon Friday in central Christchurch, when the gunman entered the Al Noor Mosque and opened fire on worshipers gathered for Friday prayer. The shooter live-streamed the massacre, shooting dead one man who attempted to tackle him and killing 41 more in a 6-minute rampage. At one point, the gunman went to his car to get another weapon and returned to the mosque to kill more people. A paramedic said, quote, &ldquo;There was a river of blood coming out of the mosque.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The shooter drove away before police arrived on the scene, and headed four miles east to a second mosque, the Linwood Mosque, where he once again opened fire on worshipers, this time through a window. That&rsquo;s when Abdul Aziz, who was praying at the Linwood Mosque with his sons, ran towards the attacker, flinging a credit card machine at him and causing him to drop his shotgun. The gunman then ran to his car, and Aziz threw the shotgun, shattering the car window. The shooter drove away, leaving seven dead at the Linwood Mosque. This is Abdul Aziz describing his encounter with the attacker.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>ABDUL AZIZ:</strong> He dropped his gun and ran, and I chased him. And I chased him. He set on his car. And what I did, I had that shotgun in my hand, and I threw on him like an arrow. I threw the shotgun, and that shotgun actually smashed his window. And I could see him as frightened. Then he swore at me, and he just took off.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Minutes later, New Zealand police apprehended the shooter. The first call to police from Al Noor Mosque came at 1:41 p.m. The gunman was arrested at 2:17 p.m. Forty-nine people were dead; one more would later die in the hospital. The shooter reportedly used five guns to carry out the attack, including two semiautomatic assault weapons. New Zealand&rsquo;s attorney general, David Parker, told Radio New Zealand, quote, &ldquo;We need to ban some semiautomatics, perhaps all of them,&rdquo; unquote.</p>\n<p>Well, for more, we&rsquo;re going to Rebecca Peters in Sydney, Australia, an international arms control advocate, member of the International Network on Small Arms. She led the campaign to reform Australia&rsquo;s gun laws after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, when a gunman shot dead 35 people. After the attack, Australia cracked down on gun violence, outlawing automatic and semiautomatic rifles. More than 640,000 weapons were turned in to authorities in a nationwide buyback.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Peters, welcome back to <em>Democracy Now!</em> First, your response to what happened in neighboring New Zealand? You&rsquo;re in Australia now, where the gunman is from. And then talk about the immediate call of the New Zealand prime minister to deal with gun control immediately, even faster than you did after the Tasmanian massacre.</p>\n<p><strong>REBECCA PETERS:</strong> Well, Amy, of course, it was just so devastating and heartbreaking to hear that yet another atrocity of this sort had taken place. We&rsquo;re accustomed to hearing about these things happening in the United States, but we&rsquo;ve got out of the habit in Australia, since we don&rsquo;t have them anymore. And it was just shocking to realize that it had occurred in New Zealand and that it was an Australian who had carried out this horrific attack.</p>\n<p>And, I suppose, for those of us who have worked on the issue of trying to prevent gun violence, in addition to being heartbreaking, it was heart-sinking, because we had&mdash;there had been plenty of warnings and of advice over the years that New Zealand should strengthen its gun laws, but those warnings and advice had never been heeded.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Let&rsquo;s go back to New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>PRIME MINISTER JACINDA ARDERN:</strong> I want to also acknowledge, you know, when Australia found itself tragically in a similar position to what we find ourselves now, they took 12 days to make the decision. We have taken 72 hours. There are still some detail that needs to be worked through. I want to do that but still move as quickly as we can.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> So, that&rsquo;s the New Zealand prime minister. Rebecca Peters, explain what happened in Australia&mdash;I mean, a country, it&rsquo;s believed, of Crocodile Dundees, or gun lovers&mdash;how quickly this turned and what you&rsquo;re seeing as being demanded right now in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>REBECCA PETERS:</strong> Well, in Australia, you&rsquo;re right. We are an outdoor country. We&rsquo;re a frontier country. We have a lot of people who like to use guns. And in that sense, we&rsquo;re similar to New Zealand. We&rsquo;re culturally very similar, as well. But the laws had been&mdash;it was a patchwork of laws across the country. Each state had different laws, and many of them were not very strong. So, for example, semiautomatic weapons were available in some states but banned in other states. Some states had registrationable guns, and some did not. And what that meant was that it was possible to take advantage of the loopholes provided by the weaker-law states to commit gun violence.</p>\n<p>And in 1996, we had a mass shooting at Port Arthur in Tasmania. Thirty-five people were killed. And at the time, it was the largest tragedy of that type ever in the world. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s been surpassed since then. And although there had been many attempts to reform the laws, the politicians had always been intimidated by the gun lobby and had been reluctant to do anything. But in '96, we had a brand-new prime minister, and he said, &ldquo;I'm going to fix this.&rdquo; And so he called all the states together and said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to, once and for all, fix this problem.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And they came up with a scheme of&mdash;a list of points that all the states agreed to put into their laws as a minimum standard. And that included a ban on semiautomatic rifles and shotguns; a buyback, as you mentioned, to get rid of them; registration of all guns in every state; a much higher standard of licensing, including the need to prove that you have a legitimate reason; and a lot of other&mdash;a 28-day waiting period; and various other measures, which basically closed the loopholes and raised the standard. And we&rsquo;ve been much safer ever since.</p>\n<p>The first thing that obviously comes to mind when an atrocity like this happens is the question of semiautomatic weapons. And the prime minister of New Zealand, correctly, mentioned that as a priority. And in Australia, as Jacinda Ardern mentioned, it took 12 days for this agreement to be nutted out. It had to be negotiated between eight states. But that was obviously pretty quick. In New Zealand, she has announced pretty well immediately that they plan to make reforms. My slight concern is that they should take the time to consider not just piecemeal changes, like not just banning military assault weapons, but looking at all the reforms that need to be made, because the New Zealand gun law is full of loopholes. It&rsquo;s basically the same as Australia&rsquo;s worst laws were about 20 years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> So, what kind of gun lobby does New Zealand have? Is it similar to Australia? And why didn&rsquo;t New Zealand pass the same kind of legislation when you did, back in 19&mdash;back in the time of the Tasmania massacre?</p>\n<p><strong>REBECCA PETERS:</strong> In '96, yes, it was. So, originally, New Zealand should have joined that scheme, because the scheme was developed under the auspices of something called the Australasian Police Ministers' Council. We have a police minister in every state, and New Zealand also has a police minister. And the word &ldquo;Australasian&rdquo; means Australia and New Zealand. And our two countries work together on policing questions a lot, on crime prevention and investigation. And it made sense for New Zealand also to pass the same sort of gun laws that were being passed in Australia.</p>\n<p>But the gun lobby is very powerful in New Zealand. And basically&mdash;and at the time, it was the National Party government, which is more susceptible to the gun lobby, because it has its&mdash;it sees its strength as being in the rural areas. And basically, the idea of joining the Australian scheme was vetoed by the gun lobby, which was a huge shame, because they didn&rsquo;t make the progress that they should have made.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> <em>New York Times</em> reported Friday, New Zealand is almost alone with the United States in not registering 96 percent of its firearms. Those are its most common firearms, the ones most used in crimes. Rebecca?</p>\n<p><strong>REBECCA PETERS:</strong> Yeah, yeah. And that was the case in at least three Australian states 20 years ago. The only firearms that were registered were handguns. But most guns are not handguns. And so, yes, it means that for the vast majority of guns in New Zealand, there&rsquo;s no record of who has them or where they are. There&rsquo;s no ability to know when a person becomes ineligible to have a gun. There&rsquo;s no way of knowing if they have it, and therefore there&rsquo;s no way of taking it away from them. Like, in Australia, the most common reason for losing your license is domestic violence. And we have registration of guns, so if a person loses their license, the police also know how many guns they actually have.</p>\n<p>The other thing about registration, which is just so crucial, is, if you have a licensing system&mdash;New Zealand does have a licensing system, although it&rsquo;s very easy to get a license. The idea of a licensing system is, only a person with a license is allowed to have a gun. But if you don&rsquo;t have a registration system, then there&rsquo;s nothing to keep a licensed gun owner accountable. Like, if I have a license and I buy a gun, since there&rsquo;s no registration, I can easily sell it or give it to you, even though you don&rsquo;t have a license, and there&rsquo;s no chance that I&rsquo;ll be caught. And so, registration is absolutely crucial to make sure that your licensing system works.</p>\n<p>And those are the kinds of things that the New Zealand government should look at. Those are the sorts of loopholes they should look at closing, rather than just focusing on banning assault weapons. And they mention assault weapons a lot. And obviously they should be banned, but the tricky thing with semiautomatic rifles is that there are semiautomatic rifles that are not considered to be assault weapons but that can be modified so that they become assault weapons. And that&rsquo;s why, in Australia, all semiautomatic rifles were banned, to avoid the problem of people buying non-assault weapons and modifying them to become assault weapons. So, New Zealand should take that same step.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Well, Rebecca Peters, I want to thank you for being with us, international arms control advocate, member of the International Network on Small Arms, led the campaign to reform Australia&rsquo;s gun laws after the Port Arthur massacre. One last question: The laws were changed in 1996 in Australia after 35 people were killed in Tasmania. How many massacres have there been since?</p>\n<p><strong>REBECCA PETERS:</strong> Well, since then, we&rsquo;ve never had another one of these public mass shootings of the type that we used to have a lot of. What we have had is a couple of family killings, where a father has killed his family while they were asleep, for example. But that&rsquo;s a different type of phenomenon, and it doesn&rsquo;t require a semiautomatic. But when you think about these kinds of events, that are so&mdash;that the U.S., for example, is so plagued by, and the type of event we had in '96, the one that's just occurred in New Zealand, we&rsquo;ve never had another event like that.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Rebecca Peters, thanks so much for being with us.

It was the deadliest shooting in the country\u2019s modern history. The shooter reportedly used five guns to carry out the attack, including two semiautomatic assault weapons. We speak with Rebecca Peters, an international arms control advocate and member of the International Action Network on Small Arms. She led the campaign to reform Australia\u2019s gun laws after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, when a gunman shot dead 35 people at a cafe. After the attack, Australia cracked down on gun violence, outlawing automatic and semiautomatic rifles. More than 640,000 weapons were turned in to authorities in a nationwide buyback.\nAMY GOODMAN: Fifty people are dead, and millions around the globe are mourning, following the massacre at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, Friday. The terrorist attack unfolded during Friday prayer, when a lone gunman and avid white supremacist opened fire on worshipers while live-streaming the attack on Facebook. It was the deadliest shooting in the country\u2019s modern history. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described Friday as one of New Zealand\u2019s darkest days and vowed to change the country\u2019s gun laws.\nPRIME MINISTER JACINDA ARDERN: The terror attack in Christchurch on Friday was the worst act of terrorism on our shores. It was in fact one of the worst globally in recent times. It has exposed a range of weaknesses in New Zealand\u2019s gun laws. The clear lesson from history around the world is that to make our communities safer, the time to act is now.\nAMY GOODMAN: Police have arrested and charged a 28-year-old Australian man named Brenton Tarrant, an anti-immigrant white supremacist who published a manifesto in which he praised President Donald Trump as a \u201csymbol of renewed white identity and common purpose,\u201d unquote. But Trump has refused to acknowledge the global rise of white nationalism in the wake of the attack, saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems, I guess,\u201d he said.\nIn New Zealand, the Muslim community is mourning the dead, the youngest among them 3 years old. Mucad Ibrahim was murdered after being separated from his brother and father in the chaos at the Al Noor Mosque.\nThe terror began in the early afternoon Friday in central Christchurch, when the gunman entered the Al Noor Mosque and opened fire on worshipers gathered for Friday prayer. The shooter live-streamed the massacre, shooting dead one man who attempted to tackle him and killing 41 more in a 6-minute rampage. At one point, the gunman went to his car to get another weapon and returned to the mosque to kill more people. A paramedic said, quote, \u201cThere was a river of blood coming out of the mosque.\u201d\nThe shooter drove away before police arrived on the scene, and headed four miles east to a second mosque, the Linwood Mosque, where he once again opened fire on worshipers, this time through a window. That\u2019s when Abdul Aziz, who was praying at the Linwood Mosque with his sons, ran towards the attacker, flinging a credit card machine at him and causing him to drop his shotgun. The gunman then ran to his car, and Aziz threw the shotgun, shattering the car window. The shooter drove away, leaving seven dead at the Linwood Mosque. This is Abdul Aziz describing his encounter with the attacker.\nABDUL AZIZ: He dropped his gun and ran, and I chased him. And I chased him. He set on his car. And what I did, I had that shotgun in my hand, and I threw on him like an arrow. I threw the shotgun, and that shotgun actually smashed his window. And I could see him as frightened. Then he swore at me, and he just took off.\nAMY GOODMAN: Minutes later, New Zealand police apprehended the shooter. The first call to police from Al Noor Mosque came at 1:41 p.m. The gunman was arrested at 2:17 p.m. Forty-nine people were dead; one more would later die in the hospital. The shooter reportedly used five guns to carry out the attack, including two semiautomatic assault weapons. New Zealand\u2019s attorney general, David Parker, told Radio New Zealand, quote, \u201cWe need to ban some semiautomatics, perhaps all of them,\u201d unquote.\nWell, for more, we\u2019re going to Rebecca Peters in Sydney, Australia, an international arms control advocate, member of the International Network on Small Arms. She led the campaign to reform Australia\u2019s gun laws after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, when a gunman shot dead 35 people. After the attack, Australia cracked down on gun violence, outlawing automatic and semiautomatic rifles. More than 640,000 weapons were turned in to authorities in a nationwide buyback.\nRebecca Peters, welcome back to Democracy Now! First, your response to what happened in neighboring New Zealand? You\u2019re in Australia now, where the gunman is from. And then talk about the immediate call of the New Zealand prime minister to deal with gun control immediately, even faster than you did after the Tasmanian massacre.\nREBECCA PETERS: Well, Amy, of course, it was just so devastating and heartbreaking to hear that yet another atrocity of this sort had taken place. We\u2019re accustomed to hearing about these things happening in the United States, but we\u2019ve got out of the habit in Australia, since we don\u2019t have them anymore. And it was just shocking to realize that it had occurred in New Zealand and that it was an Australian who had carried out this horrific attack.\nAnd, I suppose, for those of us who have worked on the issue of trying to prevent gun violence, in addition to being heartbreaking, it was heart-sinking, because we had\u2014there had been plenty of warnings and of advice over the years that New Zealand should strengthen its gun laws, but those warnings and advice had never been heeded.\nAMY GOODMAN: Let\u2019s go back to New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.\nPRIME MINISTER JACINDA ARDERN: I want to also acknowledge, you know, when Australia found itself tragically in a similar position to what we find ourselves now, they took 12 days to make the decision. We have taken 72 hours. There are still some detail that needs to be worked through. I want to do that but still move as quickly as we can.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, that\u2019s the New Zealand prime minister. Rebecca Peters, explain what happened in Australia\u2014I mean, a country, it\u2019s believed, of Crocodile Dundees, or gun lovers\u2014how quickly this turned and what you\u2019re seeing as being demanded right now in New Zealand.\nREBECCA PETERS: Well, in Australia, you\u2019re right. We are an outdoor country. We\u2019re a frontier country. We have a lot of people who like to use guns. And in that sense, we\u2019re similar to New Zealand. We\u2019re culturally very similar, as well. But the laws had been\u2014it was a patchwork of laws across the country. Each state had different laws, and many of them were not very strong. So, for example, semiautomatic weapons were available in some states but banned in other states. Some states had registrationable guns, and some did not. And what that meant was that it was possible to take advantage of the loopholes provided by the weaker-law states to commit gun violence.\nAnd in 1996, we had a mass shooting at Port Arthur in Tasmania. Thirty-five people were killed. And at the time, it was the largest tragedy of that type ever in the world. Unfortunately, it\u2019s been surpassed since then. And although there had been many attempts to reform the laws, the politicians had always been intimidated by the gun lobby and had been reluctant to do anything. But in '96, we had a brand-new prime minister, and he said, \u201cI'm going to fix this.\u201d And so he called all the states together and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to, once and for all, fix this problem.\u201d\nAnd they came up with a scheme of\u2014a list of points that all the states agreed to put into their laws as a minimum standard. And that included a ban on semiautomatic rifles and shotguns; a buyback, as you mentioned, to get rid of them; registration of all guns in every state; a much higher standard of licensing, including the need to prove that you have a legitimate reason; and a lot of other\u2014a 28-day waiting period; and various other measures, which basically closed the loopholes and raised the standard. And we\u2019ve been much safer ever since.\nThe first thing that obviously comes to mind when an atrocity like this happens is the question of semiautomatic weapons. And the prime minister of New Zealand, correctly, mentioned that as a priority. And in Australia, as Jacinda Ardern mentioned, it took 12 days for this agreement to be nutted out. It had to be negotiated between eight states. But that was obviously pretty quick. In New Zealand, she has announced pretty well immediately that they plan to make reforms. My slight concern is that they should take the time to consider not just piecemeal changes, like not just banning military assault weapons, but looking at all the reforms that need to be made, because the New Zealand gun law is full of loopholes. It\u2019s basically the same as Australia\u2019s worst laws were about 20 years ago.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, what kind of gun lobby does New Zealand have? Is it similar to Australia? And why didn\u2019t New Zealand pass the same kind of legislation when you did, back in 19\u2014back in the time of the Tasmania massacre?\nREBECCA PETERS: In '96, yes, it was. So, originally, New Zealand should have joined that scheme, because the scheme was developed under the auspices of something called the Australasian Police Ministers' Council. We have a police minister in every state, and New Zealand also has a police minister. And the word \u201cAustralasian\u201d means Australia and New Zealand. And our two countries work together on policing questions a lot, on crime prevention and investigation. And it made sense for New Zealand also to pass the same sort of gun laws that were being passed in Australia.\nBut the gun lobby is very powerful in New Zealand. And basically\u2014and at the time, it was the National Party government, which is more susceptible to the gun lobby, because it has its\u2014it sees its strength as being in the rural areas. And basically, the idea of joining the Australian scheme was vetoed by the gun lobby, which was a huge shame, because they didn\u2019t make the progress that they should have made.\nAMY GOODMAN: New York Times reported Friday, New Zealand is almost alone with the United States in not registering 96 percent of its firearms. Those are its most common firearms, the ones most used in crimes. Rebecca?\nREBECCA PETERS: Yeah, yeah. And that was the case in at least three Australian states 20 years ago. The only firearms that were registered were handguns. But most guns are not handguns. And so, yes, it means that for the vast majority of guns in New Zealand, there\u2019s no record of who has them or where they are. There\u2019s no ability to know when a person becomes ineligible to have a gun. There\u2019s no way of knowing if they have it, and therefore there\u2019s no way of taking it away from them. Like, in Australia, the most common reason for losing your license is domestic violence. And we have registration of guns, so if a person loses their license, the police also know how many guns they actually have.\nThe other thing about registration, which is just so crucial, is, if you have a licensing system\u2014New Zealand does have a licensing system, although it\u2019s very easy to get a license. The idea of a licensing system is, only a person with a license is allowed to have a gun. But if you don\u2019t have a registration system, then there\u2019s nothing to keep a licensed gun owner accountable. Like, if I have a license and I buy a gun, since there\u2019s no registration, I can easily sell it or give it to you, even though you don\u2019t have a license, and there\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be caught. And so, registration is absolutely crucial to make sure that your licensing system works.\nAnd those are the kinds of things that the New Zealand government should look at. Those are the sorts of loopholes they should look at closing, rather than just focusing on banning assault weapons. And they mention assault weapons a lot. And obviously they should be banned, but the tricky thing with semiautomatic rifles is that there are semiautomatic rifles that are not considered to be assault weapons but that can be modified so that they become assault weapons. And that\u2019s why, in Australia, all semiautomatic rifles were banned, to avoid the problem of people buying non-assault weapons and modifying them to become assault weapons. So, New Zealand should take that same step.\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, Rebecca Peters, I want to thank you for being with us, international arms control advocate, member of the International Network on Small Arms, led the campaign to reform Australia\u2019s gun laws after the Port Arthur massacre. One last question: The laws were changed in 1996 in Australia after 35 people were killed in Tasmania. How many massacres have there been since?\nREBECCA PETERS: Well, since then, we\u2019ve never had another one of these public mass shootings of the type that we used to have a lot of. What we have had is a couple of family killings, where a father has killed his family while they were asleep, for example. But that\u2019s a different type of phenomenon, and it doesn\u2019t require a semiautomatic. But when you think about these kinds of events, that are so\u2014that the U.S., for example, is so plagued by, and the type of event we had in '96, the one that's just occurred in New Zealand, we\u2019ve never had another event like that.\nAMY GOODMAN: Rebecca Peters, thanks so much for being with us. We can\u2019t count the number of times in the United States. It has been hundreds and hundreds and hundreds in this last 23 years. This is Democracy Now! We\u2019ll link to your piece in The Sydney Morning Herald headlined \u201c'It didn't have to be this way\u2019: how the gun lobby made [New Zealand] less safe.\u201d\nThis is Democracy Now!

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Friday that the U.S. will start denying visas to members of the ICC who may be investigating alleged war crimes by the U.S. military in Afghanistan. In September, national security adviser John Bolton threatened U.S. sanctions against ICC judges if they continued to investigate alleged war crimes committed by U.S. troops in Afghanistan. A 2016 ICC report accused the U.S. military of torturing at least 61 prisoners in Afghanistan during the ongoing war.

We speak with Jamil Dakwar, director of the Human Rights Program at the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> This is <em>Democracy Now!</em> I&rsquo;m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz&aacute;lez.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> We turn now to the Trump administration&rsquo;s decision to bar International Criminal Court investigators from entering the U.S. In September, national security adviser John Bolton threatened U.S. sanctions against ICC judges if they continued to investigate alleged war crimes committed by U.S. troops in Afghanistan. A 2016 report by the International Criminal Court accused the U.S. military of torturing at least 61 prisoners in Afghanistan during the ongoing war. The report also accused the CIA of subjecting at least 27 prisoners to torture, including rape, at CIA prison sites in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Friday that the U.S. will start denying visas to members of the ICC who may be investigating alleged war crimes by the U.S. military in Afghanistan.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO:</strong> Since 1998, the United States has declined to join the ICC because of its broad, unaccountable prosecutorial powers and the threat it poses to American national sovereignty. We are determined to protect the American and allied military and civilian personnel from living in fear of unjust prosecution for actions taken to defend our great nation. We feared that the court could eventually pursue politically motivated prosecutions of Americans, and our fears were warranted.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p>In November of 2017, the ICC prosecutor requested approval to initiate an investigation into, quote, &ldquo;the situation in Afghanistan,&rdquo; end of quote, that could illegitimately target American personnel for prosecutions and sentencing. In September of 2018, the Trump administration warned the ICC that if it tried to pursue an investigation of Americans, there would be consequences. I understand that the prosecutors&rsquo; request for an investigation remains pending.</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p>Thus, today, persistent to existing legal authority to post visa restrictions on any alien, quote, &ldquo;whose entry or proposed activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences,&rdquo; end of quote, I&rsquo;m announcing a policy of U.S. visa restrictions on those individuals directly responsible for any ICC investigation of U.S. personnel. This includes persons who take or have taken action to request or further such an investigation. These visa restrictions may also be used to deter ICC efforts to pursue allied personnel, including Israelis, without allies&rsquo; consent.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p>\n<p>To talk more about the U.S. decision to deny visas to those involved in the International Criminal Court investigation, we&rsquo;re joined now by Jamil Dakwar, the director of the Human Rights Program at the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>\n<p>Welcome back to <em>Democracy Now!</em> It&rsquo;s great to have you with us. Your response to this announcement?</p>\n<p><strong>JAMIL DAKWAR:</strong> OK. I think this is unprecedented. This is the first time that the U.S. government is targeting foreign judges and prosecutors, personnel of an international&mdash;one of the most respected international judicial bodies in the world, with a travel ban. As far as we look back, there hasn&rsquo;t been any kind of precedent for such a thing. They&rsquo;re not only doing that. They&rsquo;re also saying anyone who assisted the ICC, who worked or will work to push for accountability for investigation before the ICC with regard to the situation of Afghanistan, particularly looking at U.S. involvement in war crimes, will be subject to the same visa restrictions. So this is an act of a country that&mdash;similar to authoritarian regime. When you have&mdash;when you&rsquo;re crushing dissent, when you&rsquo;re going after those who are disagreeing with you, when you&rsquo;re trying to punish and retaliate and intimidate those who are trying to hold you accountable, you use your powers in order to limit the way that they can do that. And that&rsquo;s really very outrageous and very concerning to us, that this is reaching to this level.</p>\n<p>But it also speaks to what this administration has been doing. I mean, this administration threatened with prosecuting judges and the prosecutors of the ICC for doing their job, and for doing the job that the United States should have done&mdash;that is, to investigate, credibly and thoroughly, war crimes and crimes against humanity that were committed in the course of the war in Afghanistan, including the use of black sites, not only in Afghanistan. This is another important aspect of this investigation, or in pending investigation, because it hasn&rsquo;t been really fully authorized by the pretrial chamber, is that it would cover not just what happened in Afghanistan, but it would cover in three countries that are linked to the conflict in Afghanistan&mdash;that is, Poland, Romania and Lithuania&mdash;because they are state parties. They joined the ICC in the&mdash;since 2002, when the court started to function.</p>\n<p>So, we will see&mdash;we will see how this will play out. We&rsquo;re very happy that the responses so far, in just the last few days, from members of the court, particularly European countries, have been very strong in condemning the Trump administration and upholding the independence and legitimacy of the court, and that any actions to deter prosecutors and the judges, that would be not acceptable and will be rejected by U.S. allies, particularly in Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> Well, let me ask you. This is reflective of an overall tendency in the Trump administration. Last year, the U.S. withdrew from the United Nations Human Rights Council, as well, and it&rsquo;s resisted over 20 requests by special rapporteurs of the United Nations looking into particular issues of human rights violations here. But this is a step further. This is not just refusing to cooperate. This is actually punishing people who are trying to get to the facts of what&rsquo;s happened. In terms of what can be done in response by the international community to what, in essence, is the United States saying, &ldquo;No one has a right to judge what we do abroad&rdquo;?</p>\n<p><strong>JAMIL DAKWAR:</strong> Well, first of all, let&rsquo;s start with what Secretary Pompeo said. He said it&rsquo;s an attack on our sovereignty. I don&rsquo;t think that anyone attacked U.S. sovereignty. It was the Afghanistan sovereignty that has been subject to the jurisdiction, because Afghanistan joined the ICC in May of 2003 and agreed that if there would be war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide&mdash;these are the worst crimes that are defined under the ICC statute or their treaty&mdash;that they would be jurisdiction for the court. So, it&rsquo;s not an issue of U.S. sovereignty. It&rsquo;s not also an issue of protecting the constitutional right of American citizens who could be tried abroad. That&rsquo;s not something that we see again and again. If you committed a crime abroad&mdash;you could be committing it anywhere in the world&mdash;you could be held accountable by those countries where you violated their criminal laws. And therefore, there is no such a thing of attacking or undermining American sovereignty.</p>\n<p>The second thing is, is that Secretary Pompeo is saying there was no consent of the governments, that being&mdash;their nationals being prosecuted or investigated by the ICC in the future. Since when war criminals have to get their consent to a criminal investigation? That&rsquo;s unheard of. So, the nature of the attacks, as you said, they are punitive, they&rsquo;re retaliatory. They are trying to go and to send a message, not just to the ICC personnel, in particular. This actually has consequences beyond the United States&rsquo; situation, of U.S. government officials who commissioned, ordered or implemented acts of torture in Afghanistan and elsewhere. So it is really a serious threat to the system that we created. The United States was responsible for creating systems after World War II, after the horror of the Holocaust, that would fight impunity, that would combat the worst crimes. And now the U.S. is leading the charge in attacking the judges. And being cheered by what countries? Cheered by Sudan, Burundi, the Philippines.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> Philippines, which also just pulled out of the International Criminal Court in the last few days. Could I ask you also, though? This must indicate that there is a real fear here on the part of the U.S. government about this investigation, to take this kind of drastic action. Could you talk about what some of what the preliminary findings of the court are in terms of the war crimes committed here?</p>\n<p><strong>JAMIL DAKWAR:</strong> So, first, it&rsquo;s important to highlight that the court, the ICC, is a court of last resort, meaning it doesn&rsquo;t jump in to investigate a crime just because it violates the crimes defined by the Rome Statute, by the ICC. It actually waits and sees what the countries that joined the court are doing, what have they done, in order to investigate violations of the ICC. And that is an important point, because the ICC people think that the ICC, you know, was&mdash;immediately acted, automatically opened investigations. That&rsquo;s not true.</p>\n<p>In the case of the United States, the situation of Afghanistan lasted for over a decade, where it was under a so-called preliminary examination. So, it was based on publicly available information. The ICC prosecutor would not use its investigative powers, but rely on media reports, on U.N. reports, other NGOs&rsquo; reports, etc. And, yes, once it comes to the conclusion that there is a reasonable belief that there were crimes that are committed in violation of the ICC, and it has a jurisdiction&mdash;and it has to also satisfy other requirements&mdash;admissibility and the interest of justice&mdash;it will then&mdash;because this one was initiated by the prosecutor&rsquo;s office, it will have to get an authorization from the pretrial chamber, a chamber of three judges of the ICC, that then examine the whole evidence.</p>\n<p>The evidence that she has is really relying heavily&mdash;well, we don&rsquo;t have access to that information, but we believe that her evidence is based on the Senate torture report, the well-documented investigation of the CIA involvement in the most brutal and gruesome acts of humiliation and torture against prisoners. And that torture report, what was released in December of 2014, basically made the&mdash;it put the United States on notice, that if the United States is not acting in light of the declassified parts of the report&mdash;because the report itself, the whole thing, was still classified, so we don&rsquo;t even have a clue what&rsquo;s in the details of that report, because the U.S. government, both under the Obama administration and under the Trump administration, resisting declassification. But what is publicly available, there is enough to justify opening an investigation.</p>\n<p>So, the prosecutor looked into that information. It looked at what the United States has done in order to hold officials accountable, both at the level of the U.S. military and the level of the CIA officials, the level of all chain of&mdash;the chain of command, meaning looking not just at the lower-rank officers and military personnel, but also at the leaders who sanctioned this policy. You have the highest level of the White House, in the Bush administration, that ordered the torture program. So they looked at what the Bush administration, the Obama administration have done in order to investigate, and they reached a conclusion that they were not credible investigations. And that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re stepping in.</p>\n<p>And they&rsquo;re stepping in because this is an important for the rule of law. It&rsquo;s important for upholding international principles against impunity. And it&rsquo;s also providing victims of torture their day in court. And that is where, I think, more than anything, is important and being sidelined by the whole response to Pompeo.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Can you talk about how psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen could be implicated in the investigation, who reaped tens of millions of dollars for designing torture techniques for the CIA?</p>\n<p><strong>JAMIL DAKWAR:</strong> So, these two individuals, who are psychologists in their private practice, were hired by the CIA after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 in order to help implement&mdash;design and implement a torture program. They have come up with, really, based on pseudoscience&mdash;it was really junk science&mdash;a theory of how to break down detainees and how to break down those suspected in involvement in the 9/11 attacks. There has been clear evidence, that we have exposed in our lawsuit, the ACLU lawsuit against the two individuals, that was settled a couple of years ago, that showed that this&mdash;that the information that they relied on, the science there was really out of&mdash;in line with any scientific&mdash;and that its purpose was really to coerce and to lead detainees to say things they may have not done. And, in fact, I think the&mdash;again, the Senate torture report has confirmed that the program, the whole program, not only was costly, was not effective, but it was also&mdash;was misleading in the way that it presented as if those two individuals&mdash;so, these two individuals made over $80 million off this program.</p>\n<p>And they, as individuals, who acted on behalf of the U.S. government, may also be subject to the ICC investigation, if it&rsquo;s authorized. We don&rsquo;t know who are the individuals who will be authorized, but I think that they should be worried. Other people who were involved in the&mdash;particularly in the worst part of the CIA torture program should be worried, I think, in the future. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that the ICC will, again, rush into prioritizing the investigation and prosecuting of U.S. officials. I think that there are other crimes that are being investigated in the Afghanistan situation, especially the crimes against Afghan nationals and the civilian population by the Taliban, by the Afghan forces there.</p>\n<p>Now, the real serious challenge for the ICC is, none of those parties&mdash;Afghan government, the Taliban and the United States government&mdash;is willing to cooperate with the ICC. So the real challenge is how&mdash;if this investigation moves forward, how the ICC will really be able to build cases, based on lack&mdash;without any cooperation with&mdash;of these, of the countries.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And, very quickly, Pompeo also named Israel, if the ICC says it&rsquo;s going to investigate Israel.</p>\n<p><strong>JAMIL DAKWAR:</strong> Yes. So, the secretary&rsquo;s announcement didn&rsquo;t only say that it&rsquo;s about U.S. officials that will be targeted by a potential investigation by ICC. He also alluded to U.S. allies, and particularly Israeli officials. There is a separate investigation&mdash;it&rsquo;s called the Palestine situation&mdash;that was actually not the initiation of the prosecutor. It was a request, a referral, by the Palestine to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity in the context of the Gaza situation in the war in 2014, also the recent attacks on protesters in the Gaza border, as well as the legality of settlements in the West Bank, to what extent they violate the ICC statute. So there&rsquo;s also that situation, where it could impact, in our view, human rights defenders, human rights lawyers, who are acting to hold officials&mdash;in this case, Israeli officials&mdash;accountable before the ICC. They could be subject to visa restrictions.</p>\n<p>And so, this is really a serious issue that has to be addressed by the U.S. Congress, particularly the House Foreign Relations Committee. We filed a Freedom of Information Act to ask for the legal basis for this policy. The U.S. government is resisting. And we&rsquo;re likely to file a lawsuit soon to force this information to be disclosed. Because it&rsquo;s not really about going after every U.S. citizen who served in the U.S. military. That is not what is going&mdash;what we&rsquo;re talking about here. This is here talking about really shutting down a legitimate investigation into war crimes. It is about deflecting from scrutiny, deflecting from upholding international law, and giving not only U.S. officials the immunity and impunity that they have enjoyed for years, but also giving other countries the same. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s emboldening other regimes that we&rsquo;ve seen over the past several months been happy to withdraw from the ICC, like the Philippines did just a year ago, and it came into effect a couple days ago.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And, Jamil Dakwar, we want to thank you for being with us, director of the Human Rights Program at the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>\n<p><strong>JAMIL DAKWAR:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> When we come back, we look at the close relationship between the Trump administration and Boeing, in 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>[break]</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> The legendary Lebanese-American musician Dick Dale, who was known as the &ldquo;King of the Surf Guitar,&rdquo; has died at the age of 81. His hit song &ldquo;Misirlou&rdquo; was an adaptation of a traditional Arabic folk tune. Dale continued performing live into this year, in part to pay his medical bills from bouts with cancer, renal failure and diabetes. He once said, &ldquo;I have to perform to save my life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The original content of this program is licensed under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/\">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License</a>.

                "text": "The Trump administration has barred International Criminal Court investigators from entering the United States. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Friday that the U.S. will start denying visas to members of the ICC who may be investigating alleged war crimes by the U.S. military in Afghanistan. In September, national security adviser John Bolton threatened U.S. sanctions against ICC judges if they continued to investigate alleged war crimes committed by U.S. troops in Afghanistan. A 2016 ICC report accused the U.S. military of torturing at least 61 prisoners in Afghanistan during the ongoing war. The report also accused the CIA of subjecting at least 27 prisoners to torture, including rape, at CIA prison sites in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania. We speak with Jamil Dakwar, director of the Human Rights Program at the American Civil Liberties Union.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: We turn now to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to bar International Criminal Court investigators from entering the U.S. In September, national security adviser John Bolton threatened U.S. sanctions against ICC judges if they continued to investigate alleged war crimes committed by U.S. troops in Afghanistan. A 2016 report by the International Criminal Court accused the U.S. military of torturing at least 61 prisoners in Afghanistan during the ongoing war. The report also accused the CIA of subjecting at least 27 prisoners to torture, including rape, at CIA prison sites in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Friday that the U.S. will start denying visas to members of the ICC who may be investigating alleged war crimes by the U.S. military in Afghanistan.\nSECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO: Since 1998, the United States has declined to join the ICC because of its broad, unaccountable prosecutorial powers and the threat it poses to American national sovereignty. We are determined to protect the American and allied military and civilian personnel from living in fear of unjust prosecution for actions taken to defend our great nation. We feared that the court could eventually pursue politically motivated prosecutions of Americans, and our fears were warranted.\nIn November of 2017, the ICC prosecutor requested approval to initiate an investigation into, quote, \u201cthe situation in Afghanistan,\u201d end of quote, that could illegitimately target American personnel for prosecutions and sentencing. In September of 2018, the Trump administration warned the ICC that if it tried to pursue an investigation of Americans, there would be consequences. I understand that the prosecutors\u2019 request for an investigation remains pending.\nThus, today, persistent to existing legal authority to post visa restrictions on any alien, quote, \u201cwhose entry or proposed activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences,\u201d end of quote, I\u2019m announcing a policy of U.S. visa restrictions on those individuals directly responsible for any ICC investigation of U.S. personnel. This includes persons who take or have taken action to request or further such an investigation. These visa restrictions may also be used to deter ICC efforts to pursue allied personnel, including Israelis, without allies\u2019 consent.\nAMY GOODMAN: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nTo talk more about the U.S. decision to deny visas to those involved in the International Criminal Court investigation, we\u2019re joined now by Jamil Dakwar, the director of the Human Rights Program at the American Civil Liberties Union.\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! It\u2019s great to have you with us. Your response to this announcement?\nJAMIL DAKWAR: OK. I think this is unprecedented. This is the first time that the U.S. government is targeting foreign judges and prosecutors, personnel of an international\u2014one of the most respected international judicial bodies in the world, with a travel ban. As far as we look back, there hasn\u2019t been any kind of precedent for such a thing. They\u2019re not only doing that. They\u2019re also saying anyone who assisted the ICC, who worked or will work to push for accountability for investigation before the ICC with regard to the situation of Afghanistan, particularly looking at U.S. involvement in war crimes, will be subject to the same visa restrictions. So this is an act of a country that\u2014similar to authoritarian regime. When you have\u2014when you\u2019re crushing dissent, when you\u2019re going after those who are disagreeing with you, when you\u2019re trying to punish and retaliate and intimidate those who are trying to hold you accountable, you use your powers in order to limit the way that they can do that. And that\u2019s really very outrageous and very concerning to us, that this is reaching to this level.\nBut it also speaks to what this administration has been doing. I mean, this administration threatened with prosecuting judges and the prosecutors of the ICC for doing their job, and for doing the job that the United States should have done\u2014that is, to investigate, credibly and thoroughly, war crimes and crimes against humanity that were committed in the course of the war in Afghanistan, including the use of black sites, not only in Afghanistan. This is another important aspect of this investigation, or in pending investigation, because it hasn\u2019t been really fully authorized by the pretrial chamber, is that it would cover not just what happened in Afghanistan, but it would cover in three countries that are linked to the conflict in Afghanistan\u2014that is, Poland, Romania and Lithuania\u2014because they are state parties. They joined the ICC in the\u2014since 2002, when the court started to function.\nSo, we will see\u2014we will see how this will play out. We\u2019re very happy that the responses so far, in just the last few days, from members of the court, particularly European countries, have been very strong in condemning the Trump administration and upholding the independence and legitimacy of the court, and that any actions to deter prosecutors and the judges, that would be not acceptable and will be rejected by U.S. allies, particularly in Europe.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Well, let me ask you. This is reflective of an overall tendency in the Trump administration. Last year, the U.S. withdrew from the United Nations Human Rights Council, as well, and it\u2019s resisted over 20 requests by special rapporteurs of the United Nations looking into particular issues of human rights violations here. But this is a step further. This is not just refusing to cooperate. This is actually punishing people who are trying to get to the facts of what\u2019s happened. In terms of what can be done in response by the international community to what, in essence, is the United States saying, \u201cNo one has a right to judge what we do abroad\u201d?\nJAMIL DAKWAR: Well, first of all, let\u2019s start with what Secretary Pompeo said. He said it\u2019s an attack on our sovereignty. I don\u2019t think that anyone attacked U.S. sovereignty. It was the Afghanistan sovereignty that has been subject to the jurisdiction, because Afghanistan joined the ICC in May of 2003 and agreed that if there would be war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide\u2014these are the worst crimes that are defined under the ICC statute or their treaty\u2014that they would be jurisdiction for the court. So, it\u2019s not an issue of U.S. sovereignty. It\u2019s not also an issue of protecting the constitutional right of American citizens who could be tried abroad. That\u2019s not something that we see again and again. If you committed a crime abroad\u2014you could be committing it anywhere in the world\u2014you could be held accountable by those countries where you violated their criminal laws. And therefore, there is no such a thing of attacking or undermining American sovereignty.\nThe second thing is, is that Secretary Pompeo is saying there was no consent of the governments, that being\u2014their nationals being prosecuted or investigated by the ICC in the future. Since when war criminals have to get their consent to a criminal investigation? That\u2019s unheard of. So, the nature of the attacks, as you said, they are punitive, they\u2019re retaliatory. They are trying to go and to send a message, not just to the ICC personnel, in particular. This actually has consequences beyond the United States\u2019 situation, of U.S. government officials who commissioned, ordered or implemented acts of torture in Afghanistan and elsewhere. So it is really a serious threat to the system that we created. The United States was responsible for creating systems after World War II, after the horror of the Holocaust, that would fight impunity, that would combat the worst crimes. And now the U.S. is leading the charge in attacking the judges. And being cheered by what countries? Cheered by Sudan, Burundi, the Philippines.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Philippines, which also just pulled out of the International Criminal Court in the last few days. Could I ask you also, though? This must indicate that there is a real fear here on the part of the U.S. government about this investigation, to take this kind of drastic action. Could you talk about what some of what the preliminary findings of the court are in terms of the war crimes committed here?\nJAMIL DAKWAR: So, first, it\u2019s important to highlight that the court, the ICC, is a court of last resort, meaning it doesn\u2019t jump in to investigate a crime just because it violates the crimes defined by the Rome Statute, by the ICC. It actually waits and sees what the countries that joined the court are doing, what have they done, in order to investigate violations of the ICC. And that is an important point, because the ICC people think that the ICC, you know, was\u2014immediately acted, automatically opened investigations. That\u2019s not true.\nIn the case of the United States, the situation of Afghanistan lasted for over a decade, where it was under a so-called preliminary examination. So, it was based on publicly available information. The ICC prosecutor would not use its investigative powers, but rely on media reports, on U.N. reports, other NGOs\u2019 reports, etc. And, yes, once it comes to the conclusion that there is a reasonable belief that there were crimes that are committed in violation of the ICC, and it has a jurisdiction\u2014and it has to also satisfy other requirements\u2014admissibility and the interest of justice\u2014it will then\u2014because this one was initiated by the prosecutor\u2019s office, it will have to get an authorization from the pretrial chamber, a chamber of three judges of the ICC, that then examine the whole evidence.\nThe evidence that she has is really relying heavily\u2014well, we don\u2019t have access to that information, but we believe that her evidence is based on the Senate torture report, the well-documented investigation of the CIA involvement in the most brutal and gruesome acts of humiliation and torture against prisoners. And that torture report, what was released in December of 2014, basically made the\u2014it put the United States on notice, that if the United States is not acting in light of the declassified parts of the report\u2014because the report itself, the whole thing, was still classified, so we don\u2019t even have a clue what\u2019s in the details of that report, because the U.S. government, both under the Obama administration and under the Trump administration, resisting declassification. But what is publicly available, there is enough to justify opening an investigation.\nSo, the prosecutor looked into that information. It looked at what the United States has done in order to hold officials accountable, both at the level of the U.S. military and the level of the CIA officials, the level of all chain of\u2014the chain of command, meaning looking not just at the lower-rank officers and military personnel, but also at the leaders who sanctioned this policy. You have the highest level of the White House, in the Bush administration, that ordered the torture program. So they looked at what the Bush administration, the Obama administration have done in order to investigate, and they reached a conclusion that they were not credible investigations. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re stepping in.\nAnd they\u2019re stepping in because this is an important for the rule of law. It\u2019s important for upholding international principles against impunity. And it\u2019s also providing victims of torture their day in court. And that is where, I think, more than anything, is important and being sidelined by the whole response to Pompeo.\nAMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about how psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen could be implicated in the investigation, who reaped tens of millions of dollars for designing torture techniques for the CIA?\nJAMIL DAKWAR: So, these two individuals, who are psychologists in their private practice, were hired by the CIA after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 in order to help implement\u2014design and implement a torture program. They have come up with, really, based on pseudoscience\u2014it was really junk science\u2014a theory of how to break down detainees and how to break down those suspected in involvement in the 9/11 attacks. There has been clear evidence, that we have exposed in our lawsuit, the ACLU lawsuit against the two individuals, that was settled a couple of years ago, that showed that this\u2014that the information that they relied on, the science there was really out of\u2014in line with any scientific\u2014and that its purpose was really to coerce and to lead detainees to say things they may have not done. And, in fact, I think the\u2014again, the Senate torture report has confirmed that the program, the whole program, not only was costly, was not effective, but it was also\u2014was misleading in the way that it presented as if those two individuals\u2014so, these two individuals made over $80 million off this program.\nAnd they, as individuals, who acted on behalf of the U.S. government, may also be subject to the ICC investigation, if it\u2019s authorized. We don\u2019t know who are the individuals who will be authorized, but I think that they should be worried. Other people who were involved in the\u2014particularly in the worst part of the CIA torture program should be worried, I think, in the future. That doesn\u2019t mean that the ICC will, again, rush into prioritizing the investigation and prosecuting of U.S. officials. I think that there are other crimes that are being investigated in the Afghanistan situation, especially the crimes against Afghan nationals and the civilian population by the Taliban, by the Afghan forces there.\nNow, the real serious challenge for the ICC is, none of those parties\u2014Afghan government, the Taliban and the United States government\u2014is willing to cooperate with the ICC. So the real challenge is how\u2014if this investigation moves forward, how the ICC will really be able to build cases, based on lack\u2014without any cooperation with\u2014of these, of the countries.\nAMY GOODMAN: And, very quickly, Pompeo also named Israel, if the ICC says it\u2019s going to investigate Israel.\nJAMIL DAKWAR: Yes. So, the secretary\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t only say that it\u2019s about U.S. officials that will be targeted by a potential investigation by ICC. He also alluded to U.S. allies, and particularly Israeli officials. There is a separate investigation\u2014it\u2019s called the Palestine situation\u2014that was actually not the initiation of the prosecutor. It was a request, a referral, by the Palestine to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity in the context of the Gaza situation in the war in 2014, also the recent attacks on protesters in the Gaza border, as well as the legality of settlements in the West Bank, to what extent they violate the ICC statute. So there\u2019s also that situation, where it could impact, in our view, human rights defenders, human rights lawyers, who are acting to hold officials\u2014in this case, Israeli officials\u2014accountable before the ICC. They could be subject to visa restrictions.\nAnd so, this is really a serious issue that has to be addressed by the U.S. Congress, particularly the House Foreign Relations Committee. We filed a Freedom of Information Act to ask for the legal basis for this policy. The U.S. government is resisting. And we\u2019re likely to file a lawsuit soon to force this information to be disclosed. Because it\u2019s not really about going after every U.S. citizen who served in the U.S. military. That is not what is going\u2014what we\u2019re talking about here. This is here talking about really shutting down a legitimate investigation into war crimes. It is about deflecting from scrutiny, deflecting from upholding international law, and giving not only U.S. officials the immunity and impunity that they have enjoyed for years, but also giving other countries the same. And that\u2019s what\u2019s emboldening other regimes that we\u2019ve seen over the past several months been happy to withdraw from the ICC, like the Philippines did just a year ago, and it came into effect a couple days ago.\nAMY GOODMAN: And, Jamil Dakwar, we want to thank you for being with us, director of the Human Rights Program at the American Civil Liberties Union.\nJAMIL DAKWAR: Thank you.\nAMY GOODMAN: When we come back, we look at the close relationship between the Trump administration and Boeing, in 30 seconds.\n[break]\nAMY GOODMAN: The legendary Lebanese-American musician Dick Dale, who was known as the \u201cKing of the Surf Guitar,\u201d has died at the age of 81.

President Trump has publicly praised Boeing hundreds of times in his two years in office and participated in efforts to sell its planes, including the 737 MAX series, to countries and airlines around the world. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg praised Trump&rsquo;s support at a dinner last August at Trump&rsquo;s Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, who was appointed by Trump, spent 31 years as a Boeing executive. And Trump&rsquo;s former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, has been nominated to the Boeing board of directors.

His recent piece in The Nation is titled &ldquo;A Former Boeing Executive Is Now Running the Pentagon.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> This is <em>Democracy Now!</em> I&rsquo;m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz&aacute;lez.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> Well, the Trump administration&rsquo;s close ties to Boeing are facing new scrutiny in the wake of deadly plane crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia involving the Boeing 737 MAX 8 jet. The Transportation Department has launched an investigation into the Federal Aviation Administration&rsquo;s approval of the plane, since Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed last week, killing all 157 people on board. The Ethiopian transport minister said early investigations have revealed clear similarities between the crash in Ethiopia and the Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610 that crashed in October, killing 189 people. While the detailed information has yet to be released, flight tracking data shows both flights seemed to go through unpredictable climbs and descents before crashing just minutes after takeoff. The U.S. did not immediately ground Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets after the crash in Ethiopia, despite growing international pressure. President Trump eventually ordered U.S. airlines to ground all the planes, but continued to praise Boeing. All Boeing 737 MAX jets around the world have now been grounded.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> President Trump has publicly praised Boeing hundreds of times in his two years in office and participated in efforts to sell its planes, including the 737 MAX series, to countries and airlines around the world. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg praised Trump&rsquo;s support at a dinner last August at Trump&rsquo;s Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, who was appointed by Trump, spent 31 years as a Boeing executive. And Trump&rsquo;s former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, has been nominated to the Boeing board of directors.</p>\n<p>We go now to Washington, D.C., where we&rsquo;re joined by Bill Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. In January, he wrote the <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/a-former-boeing-executive-is-now-running-the-pentagon/\">piece</a> for <em>The Nation</em> headlined &ldquo;A Former Boeing Executive Is Now Running the Pentagon.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Do you think that has some bearing, Bill Hartung, on President Trump dragging his feet on the grounding of the MAX series, after almost 250 people were killed, between Indonesia and Ethiopia, in the Boeing MAX 8 planes?</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM HARTUNG:</strong> Well, it&rsquo;s hard to know how Donald Trump&rsquo;s mind works, obviously, but Boeing has such clout in Washington, particularly on the defense side, but also viewed as a major commercial force in its airline business, that it&rsquo;s certainly possible. You know, we don&rsquo;t have a smoking gun, so to speak, but, you know, as you said, Trump is so close to Boeing, I wouldn&rsquo;t rule it out, that at least it gave them pause about doing anything that would hurt Boeing&rsquo;s interests.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> And, Bill Hartung, what about the whole issue of the FAA&rsquo;s role in green-lighting the use of the 737 MAX 8 and basically depending on Boeing to be the one to let them know that everything was OK with the new plane?</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM HARTUNG:</strong> Well, this is a common practice. You know, you sort of like&mdash;companies sort of capture the regulatory agencies, and the regulatory agencies almost become partners or supporters of industry instead of regulators of industry. And so, I think that&rsquo;s part of what happened here.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Bill Hartung, can you talk to about Shanahan, the longest acting defense secretary in history, his significance and his long history at Boeing, and what that means for U.S. foreign policy and the Pentagon?</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM HARTUNG:</strong> Well, this is what Eisenhower had in mind when he talked about unwarranted influence by the military-industrial complex. There couldn&rsquo;t be a better example of this. And in his 31 years at Boeing, Shanahan worked on missile defense. He oversaw the Apache helicopter, which is being used in Yemen. He also worked on the airliner side. So he&rsquo;s spent a lot more time pushing Boeing products than he&rsquo;s ever spent on defense policy. And when it comes to the taxpayers versus Boeing, in his mind, I think, Boeing wins out.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Can you talk more about his serving the interests of Boeing even as acting secretary of defense?</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM HARTUNG:</strong> Well, he was supposed to recuse himself from Boeing matters, but it&rsquo;s not possible to do that. Boeing gets $20 billion a year. They&rsquo;re the second-biggest defense contractor. He actually&mdash;he&rsquo;s been trashing Lockheed Martin, saying Boeing could run programs better, like the F-35. Even more egregious, he&rsquo;s been pushing a Boeing plane, the F-15X, which the Air Force doesn&rsquo;t even want. And he&rsquo;s actually&mdash;private groups have called for an ethics investigation as relating to that.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s also&mdash;there&rsquo;s a whole range of issues before him that would benefit Boeing. He&rsquo;s a big advocate of the Space Force. You know, he&rsquo;s going to have to decide about U.S. role in Yemen, or at least weigh in. And Boeing sells combat aircraft, bombs, attack helicopters, maintains the planes being used by Saudi Arabia to do the bombing raids in the war. They&rsquo;re building a new ICBM, one of the competitors to do that, a ballistic missile. And some critics have said this is the most dangerous weapon in the U.S. arsenal, because it&rsquo;s on hair-trigger alert. President would have minutes to decide whether to use one of these things. He&rsquo;s likely to weigh in, if this becomes an issue, on behalf of ICBMs and Boeing&rsquo;s interests. There&rsquo;s also the KC-46, which is a tanker plane. It&rsquo;s been so screwed up, that the Air Force has decided they&rsquo;re not even sure they&rsquo;re going to accept delivery yet. How is he going to weigh in on that? Likely, he&rsquo;s going to try to give Boeing a break.</p>\n<p>So, there&rsquo;s a whole range of issues. It&rsquo;s almost hard to think of anything in the Pentagon, where there&rsquo;s not a connection that could benefit major contractors, where Shanahan is at the middle of that decision making. And as I said, because his career has been really shilling for defense contractors, not making defense policy, it&rsquo;s a huge problem.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> And you&rsquo;ve also written that he&rsquo;s been involved very much in Trump&rsquo;s idea of developing a Space Development&mdash;a Space Force and a Space Development Agency, which you call an &ldquo;authority on steroids&rdquo; to shove more expensive contracts out the door. Could you expand on that?</p>\n<p><strong>WILLIAM HARTUNG:</strong> Yes. The Space Development Agency basically wants to fast-track these weapons programs that deal with military, space, the militarization of space, which means there could be technical problems, there could be cost overruns. I think the bigger issue is, this administration is now talking about testing weapons in space&mdash;laser beams, particle lasers, particle beams. These are the kind of things, the sort of Buck Rogers stuff, that Ronald Reagan talked about, all of which failed miserably. In fact, Shanahan oversaw the Airborne Laser program, which was supposed to use 747s and lasers to zap enemy missiles in outer space. That program failed. It was canceled, cost taxpayers $5 billion. So he&rsquo;s basically pushing, you know, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s militarize space.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Bill, we have to leave it there, but we&rsquo;ll continue to cover this.

President Trump has publicly praised Boeing hundreds of times in his two years in office and participated in efforts to sell its planes, including the 737 MAX series, to countries and airlines around the world. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg praised Trump\u2019s support at a dinner last August at Trump\u2019s Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, who was appointed by Trump, spent 31 years as a Boeing executive. And Trump\u2019s former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, has been nominated to the Boeing board of directors. We speak to William Hartung, the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. His recent piece in The Nation is titled \u201cA Former Boeing Executive Is Now Running the Pentagon.\u201d\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Well, the Trump administration\u2019s close ties to Boeing are facing new scrutiny in the wake of deadly plane crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia involving the Boeing 737 MAX 8 jet. The Transportation Department has launched an investigation into the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s approval of the plane, since Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed last week, killing all 157 people on board. The Ethiopian transport minister said early investigations have revealed clear similarities between the crash in Ethiopia and the Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610 that crashed in October, killing 189 people. While the detailed information has yet to be released, flight tracking data shows both flights seemed to go through unpredictable climbs and descents before crashing just minutes after takeoff. The U.S. did not immediately ground Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets after the crash in Ethiopia, despite growing international pressure. President Trump eventually ordered U.S. airlines to ground all the planes, but continued to praise Boeing. All Boeing 737 MAX jets around the world have now been grounded.\nAMY GOODMAN: President Trump has publicly praised Boeing hundreds of times in his two years in office and participated in efforts to sell its planes, including the 737 MAX series, to countries and airlines around the world. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg praised Trump\u2019s support at a dinner last August at Trump\u2019s Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, who was appointed by Trump, spent 31 years as a Boeing executive. And Trump\u2019s former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, has been nominated to the Boeing board of directors.\nWe go now to Washington, D.C., where we\u2019re joined by Bill Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. In January, he wrote the piece for The Nation headlined \u201cA Former Boeing Executive Is Now Running the Pentagon.\u201d\nDo you think that has some bearing, Bill Hartung, on President Trump dragging his feet on the grounding of the MAX series, after almost 250 people were killed, between Indonesia and Ethiopia, in the Boeing MAX 8 planes?\nWILLIAM HARTUNG: Well, it\u2019s hard to know how Donald Trump\u2019s mind works, obviously, but Boeing has such clout in Washington, particularly on the defense side, but also viewed as a major commercial force in its airline business, that it\u2019s certainly possible. You know, we don\u2019t have a smoking gun, so to speak, but, you know, as you said, Trump is so close to Boeing, I wouldn\u2019t rule it out, that at least it gave them pause about doing anything that would hurt Boeing\u2019s interests.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And, Bill Hartung, what about the whole issue of the FAA\u2019s role in green-lighting the use of the 737 MAX 8 and basically depending on Boeing to be the one to let them know that everything was OK with the new plane?\nWILLIAM HARTUNG: Well, this is a common practice. You know, you sort of like\u2014companies sort of capture the regulatory agencies, and the regulatory agencies almost become partners or supporters of industry instead of regulators of industry. And so, I think that\u2019s part of what happened here.\nAMY GOODMAN: Bill Hartung, can you talk to about Shanahan, the longest acting defense secretary in history, his significance and his long history at Boeing, and what that means for U.S. foreign policy and the Pentagon?\nWILLIAM HARTUNG: Well, this is what Eisenhower had in mind when he talked about unwarranted influence by the military-industrial complex. There couldn\u2019t be a better example of this. And in his 31 years at Boeing, Shanahan worked on missile defense. He oversaw the Apache helicopter, which is being used in Yemen. He also worked on the airliner side. So he\u2019s spent a lot more time pushing Boeing products than he\u2019s ever spent on defense policy. And when it comes to the taxpayers versus Boeing, in his mind, I think, Boeing wins out.\nAMY GOODMAN: Can you talk more about his serving the interests of Boeing even as acting secretary of defense?\nWILLIAM HARTUNG: Well, he was supposed to recuse himself from Boeing matters, but it\u2019s not possible to do that. Boeing gets $20 billion a year. They\u2019re the second-biggest defense contractor. He actually\u2014he\u2019s been trashing Lockheed Martin, saying Boeing could run programs better, like the F-35. Even more egregious, he\u2019s been pushing a Boeing plane, the F-15X, which the Air Force doesn\u2019t even want. And he\u2019s actually\u2014private groups have called for an ethics investigation as relating to that.\nHe\u2019s also\u2014there\u2019s a whole range of issues before him that would benefit Boeing. He\u2019s a big advocate of the Space Force. You know, he\u2019s going to have to decide about U.S. role in Yemen, or at least weigh in. And Boeing sells combat aircraft, bombs, attack helicopters, maintains the planes being used by Saudi Arabia to do the bombing raids in the war. They\u2019re building a new ICBM, one of the competitors to do that, a ballistic missile. And some critics have said this is the most dangerous weapon in the U.S. arsenal, because it\u2019s on hair-trigger alert. President would have minutes to decide whether to use one of these things. He\u2019s likely to weigh in, if this becomes an issue, on behalf of ICBMs and Boeing\u2019s interests. There\u2019s also the KC-46, which is a tanker plane. It\u2019s been so screwed up, that the Air Force has decided they\u2019re not even sure they\u2019re going to accept delivery yet. How is he going to weigh in on that? Likely, he\u2019s going to try to give Boeing a break.\nSo, there\u2019s a whole range of issues. It\u2019s almost hard to think of anything in the Pentagon, where there\u2019s not a connection that could benefit major contractors, where Shanahan is at the middle of that decision making. And as I said, because his career has been really shilling for defense contractors, not making defense policy, it\u2019s a huge problem.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And you\u2019ve also written that he\u2019s been involved very much in Trump\u2019s idea of developing a Space Development\u2014a Space Force and a Space Development Agency, which you call an \u201cauthority on steroids\u201d to shove more expensive contracts out the door. Could you expand on that?\nWILLIAM HARTUNG: Yes. The Space Development Agency basically wants to fast-track these weapons programs that deal with military, space, the militarization of space, which means there could be technical problems, there could be cost overruns. I think the bigger issue is, this administration is now talking about testing weapons in space\u2014laser beams, particle lasers, particle beams. These are the kind of things, the sort of Buck Rogers stuff, that Ronald Reagan talked about, all of which failed miserably. In fact, Shanahan oversaw the Airborne Laser program, which was supposed to use 747s and lasers to zap enemy missiles in outer space. That program failed. It was canceled, cost taxpayers $5 billion. So he\u2019s basically pushing, you know, \u201cLet\u2019s militarize space.\u201d\nAMY GOODMAN: Bill, we have to leave it there, but we\u2019ll continue to cover this. Bill Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy.\nI\u2019ll be speaking in Northampton on Thursday and in Purchase on Sunday. Check our website.

It was the deadliest attack in New Zealand&rsquo;s history. The worshipers killed in the Christchurch massacre came from around the world. Most of them were immigrants, or refugees who had come to New Zealand seeking safety. Six Pakistanis, four Jordanians, four Egyptians and at least three Bangladeshis are among the dead. The Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s foreign ministry said that six of the victims were of Palestinian origin.

The Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s foreign ministry said that six of the victims were of Palestinian origin.</p>\n<p>Sixteen-year-old Syrian refugee Hamza Mustafa was killed in the attack alongside his brother Khaled, who had come to New Zealand to escape atrocities in Syria. Seventy-one-year-old Haji-Daoud Nabi, who fled war in Afghanistan and settled in New Zealand 40 years ago, was killed while shielding a friend&rsquo;s body at the Al Noor Mosque. The family of the youngest victim, 3-year-old Mucad Ibrahim, came from Somalia as refugees fleeing violence decades before last week&rsquo;s attack.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Fifty-year-old Naeem Rashid was killed at the Al Noor Mosque after he tried to grab the shooter&rsquo;s gun. Rashid was a teacher from Pakistan who had been planning his son&rsquo;s spring wedding. His son, Talha, was killed alongside his father. Pakistan&rsquo;s prime minister announced Rashid would be presented with a national award for his bravery. New Zealand football goalkeeper, 33-year-old Atta Elayyan, who had just become a father, was also among the 50 victims. So were 14-year-old Sayyad Milne, 44-year-old Husna Ahmed, and father of two, Lilik Abdul Hamid.</p>\n<p>This is New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaking Tuesday.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>PRIME MINISTER JACINDA ARDERN:</strong> We are a nation of 200 ethnicities, 160 languages. We open our doors to others and say, &ldquo;Welcome.&rdquo; And the only thing that must change after the events of Friday is that this same door must close on all of those who espouse hate and fear. &hellip; We wish for every member of our communities to also feel safe. Safety means being free from the fear of violence. But it also means being free from the fear of those sentiments of racism and hate that create a place where violence can flourish. And every single one of us has the power to change that.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been widely praised for her response to the attacks. She wore a hijab while visiting with Muslim communities as a sign of respect. Ardern, who is the youngest female head of state, also vowed to reform gun laws and pledged to never use the terror suspect&rsquo;s name. Instead, she is calling on people to speak the names of those killed in the attacks.</p>\n<p>More people died in Friday&rsquo;s mass shooting than are typically murdered in an entire year in New Zealand, which is the world&rsquo;s second-safest country, according to the 2018 Global Peace Index.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> For more, we&rsquo;re joined by Eva Nisa, a lecturer in religious studies at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. Her recent <a href=\"https://middleeasteye.net/opinion/new-zealand-has-been-home-muslims-centuries-and-will-remain-so\">article</a> for <em>Middle East Eye</em> is headlined &ldquo;New Zealand has been a home to Muslims for centuries, and will remain so.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Eva Nisa, first, our condolences for this terrible massacre, this atrocity committed against the Muslim community, against the whole community of New Zealand. Can you talk about the origins of the Muslim community in your country?</p>\n<p><strong>EVA NISA:</strong> OK. First of all, thank you very much for the deepest sympathy. Yeah, New Zealand migrants&mdash;Muslims in New Zealand basically have been living here since the 18th century, 1769. We already&mdash;New Zealanders already could see there&rsquo;s two Muslims came with the French vessel. But at that time, of course, Islam was not really like&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t see the clear face of Islam, because only two people, and they didn&rsquo;t settle, too. Only in the 1850s, then we could see one family from India came to New Zealand. And since then, we could see that the number of Muslims is also growing.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> And could you also talk about what countries most of the Muslims who have migrated to New Zealand come from?</p>\n<p><strong>EVA NISA:</strong> Basically, Muslims in New Zealand, I mean, their backgrounds, it&rsquo;s very&mdash;it&rsquo;s ethnically diverse. But according to&mdash;this is the very late census, a 1991 census, when there was a census regarding the ethnic backgrounds of Muslims. It mentioned that 49 percent of Muslims, they come from South Asian background, especially the Indian ethnic backgrounds. And mostly up to this time, most Muslims in New Zealand, we can say that they have Asian backgrounds, and then, after that, followed by Muslims from other countries, of course, other ethnicities.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> I want to turn to the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaking shortly after the attack about her phone call with President Trump.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>PRIME MINISTER JACINDA ARDERN:</strong> I spoke with Donald Trump this morning. He sought to call us directly. He very much wished for his condolences to be passed on to New Zealand. He asked what offer of support the United States could provide. My message was sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Eva Nisa, your response?</p>\n<p><strong>EVA NISA:</strong> Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s one of the things that have been mentioned a lot by New Zealanders. If Muslims are asked, &ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo;&mdash;even if Muslims are asked, &ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo; they will also say the same. We just need the love and support and also sympathy, because&mdash;the other thing is, I think New Zealanders, we are very shocked with this kind of thing, because this never happened before. I mean, Jacinda Ardern mentioned this is an unprecedented tragedy, too. So, we don&rsquo;t need, let&rsquo;s say, a political kind of comment or some&mdash;I mean, I know that some politicians, they have mentioned some comments, and then they have used this&mdash;some of them even used this tragedy as part of their political tools to show that, look, there is this clash between Islam and Christianity, or Islam and the West. So, we don&rsquo;t need that kind of&mdash;so, we need just love, support and sympathy.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> I also wanted to ask you about the response of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and how she&rsquo;s being praised, wearing a hijab, comforting the victims&rsquo; families, and also, as you just said, talking about Muslims as &ldquo;us.&rdquo; This is the prime minister speaking on Friday.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>PRIME MINISTER JACINDA ARDERN:</strong> Many of those who will have been directly affected by the shooting may be migrants to New Zealand. They may even be refugees here. They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home. They are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not. They have no place in New Zealand.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And, of course, the prime minister&rsquo;s comments are being contrasted with President Trump. She made those comments on Friday. It wasn&rsquo;t hours later that President Trump signed the veto on Congress trying to stop his wall on the border, where he used the same terms that were used in the assailant&rsquo;s manifesto, the assassin&rsquo;s manifesto, referring to immigrants as &ldquo;invaders,&rdquo; immigrants coming over the border as an &ldquo;invasion.&rdquo; Eva Nisa, can you talk about the response of your prime minister, the youngest woman leader in the world?</p>\n<p><strong>EVA NISA:</strong> Yeah. I think Jacinda&rsquo;s&mdash;I mean, most New Zealanders, we are very happy with the comments made by our prime minister, Jacinda Arden. The hashtag #UnityIsPower and &ldquo;New Zealand is home for the migrants&rdquo; always has been repeated a lot. And New Zealand has been very committed to open its gate for migrants, especially&mdash;I mean, lately, in 2015, the government committed that we would receive 750 Syrian refugees. And then, after that, the government added the number of the quota to 1,000 Syrian refugees. So, that&rsquo;s one of the things that needs to be underlined, that New Zealand is basically&mdash;we are committed to welcome refugees and to make them feel that New Zealand is their home. That&rsquo;s why that kind of stuff is&mdash;it&rsquo;s very important.</p>\n<p>And the other thing regarding Jacinda Arden with the veil, that&rsquo;s also one of the things mentioned a lot, that many Muslims feel like this kind of support, I mean, a small gesture like this, means a lot. And one of the things that is quite heartbreaking, on Sunday, there were these two young Muslims who were verbally abused, attacked by this man. And yeah, he said that, &ldquo;You just go to your own country.&rdquo; But the good thing is, this man was drunk. So, it&rsquo;s one of the things that&mdash;because, you know, when this kind of thing happened, there is this&mdash;what we know as gendered Islamophobia. So, women, Muslim women, especially those who wear veil, they are visibly more recognizable as Muslims, so showing her support by wearing a veil, it means a lot for many Muslims here in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> And, Eva Nisa, I wanted to ask you&mdash;New Zealand has a relatively small Muslim population, about, I think, 1 percent of the country, compared to Australia, that has a much larger percentage, or even, obviously, all of Western Europe. Have you seen a rise in white supremacist expressions or public statements in New Zealand over the past few years?</p>\n<p><strong>EVA NISA:</strong> Yeah. Many analysts and also scholars have mentioned that for the&mdash;there is an increase in this kind of hate speech, especially comes from white supremacists, and especially for the last two decades. Some scholars mention that one. And some Muslims, also Muslims that mention, too, that especially post-9/11, there is&mdash;I mean, that happens in many countries. I mean, I know that in the United States this also happened, and there&rsquo;s an increase in hate speech. So, we are facing that one, too. But it&rsquo;s very difficult to confirm, because, of course, we don&rsquo;t have a record. There&rsquo;s no&mdash;up to this time, we don&rsquo;t have hate law in here, in New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> I wanted to quote Anjum Rahman, a spokeswoman with the Islamic Women&rsquo;s Council of New Zealand, who wrote in an <a href=\"https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/on-the-inside/384911/islamic-women-s-council-repeatedly-lobbied-to-stem-discrimination\">op-ed</a> that the council&rsquo;s growing fears about Islamophobia and the rise of the right in New Zealand were ignored by the government for years. She writes, quote, &ldquo;[W]e talked about the effects of discrimination, the issues in our communities, the rise of the alt-right and the increasing level of vitriol we were seeing online and in person. &hellip; We begged and pleaded, we demanded. We knocked on every door we could, we spoke at every forum we were invited to. &hellip; My community wants and needs accountability,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>And I wanted to end with Waleed Aly, the Muslim host of an Australian news program, <em>The Project</em>. Here he is, speaking Friday, just hours after the massacres. The video has received millions of views.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>WALEED ALY:</strong> You&rsquo;ll have to forgive me. These won&rsquo;t be my best words. The truth is, I don&rsquo;t want to be talking today. When I was asked if it&rsquo;s something that I wanted to do, I resisted it all day, until, finally I had this overwhelming sense that it was somehow my responsibility to do so. &hellip; I went to the mosque today. I do that every Friday, just like the people in those mosques in Christchurch today. I know exactly what those moments before the shooting began would have been like. I know how quiet, how still, how introspective those people would have been, before they were suddenly gunned down. &hellip; If you&rsquo;ve been talking about being tough on terrorism for years in the communities that allegedly support it, show us how tough you are now. For mine, I&rsquo;m going to say the same thing I said about four years ago, after a horrific Islamist attack. Now? Now we come together. Now we understand this is not a game. Terrorism doesn&rsquo;t choose its victims selectively, that we are one community, and that everything we say to try to tear people apart, demonize particular groups, set them against each other, that all has consequences, even if we&rsquo;re not the ones with our fingers on the trigger.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Waleed Aly, the Muslim host of the Australian news program <em>The Project</em>. And we want to thank Eva Nisa, the lecturer in religious studies at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.

It was the deadliest attack in New Zealand\u2019s history. The worshipers killed in the Christchurch massacre came from around the world. Most of them were immigrants, or refugees who had come to New Zealand seeking safety. Six Pakistanis, four Jordanians, four Egyptians and at least three Bangladeshis are among the dead. The Palestinian Authority\u2019s foreign ministry said that six of the victims were of Palestinian origin.

It was the deadliest attack in New Zealand\u2019s history. The worshipers killed in the Christchurch massacre came from around the world. Most of them were immigrants, or refugees who had come to New Zealand seeking safety. Six Pakistanis, four Jordanians, four Egyptians and at least three Bangladeshis are among the dead. The Palestinian Authority\u2019s foreign ministry said that six of the victims were of Palestinian origin.\nSixteen-year-old Syrian refugee Hamza Mustafa was killed in the attack alongside his brother Khaled, who had come to New Zealand to escape atrocities in Syria. Seventy-one-year-old Haji-Daoud Nabi, who fled war in Afghanistan and settled in New Zealand 40 years ago, was killed while shielding a friend\u2019s body at the Al Noor Mosque. The family of the youngest victim, 3-year-old Mucad Ibrahim, came from Somalia as refugees fleeing violence decades before last week\u2019s attack.\nAMY GOODMAN: Fifty-year-old Naeem Rashid was killed at the Al Noor Mosque after he tried to grab the shooter\u2019s gun. Rashid was a teacher from Pakistan who had been planning his son\u2019s spring wedding. His son, Talha, was killed alongside his father. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister announced Rashid would be presented with a national award for his bravery. New Zealand football goalkeeper, 33-year-old Atta Elayyan, who had just become a father, was also among the 50 victims. So were 14-year-old Sayyad Milne, 44-year-old Husna Ahmed, and father of two, Lilik Abdul Hamid.\nThis is New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaking Tuesday.\nPRIME MINISTER JACINDA ARDERN: We are a nation of 200 ethnicities, 160 languages. We open our doors to others and say, \u201cWelcome.\u201d And the only thing that must change after the events of Friday is that this same door must close on all of those who espouse hate and fear. \u2026 We wish for every member of our communities to also feel safe. Safety means being free from the fear of violence. But it also means being free from the fear of those sentiments of racism and hate that create a place where violence can flourish. And every single one of us has the power to change that.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been widely praised for her response to the attacks. She wore a hijab while visiting with Muslim communities as a sign of respect. Ardern, who is the youngest female head of state, also vowed to reform gun laws and pledged to never use the terror suspect\u2019s name. Instead, she is calling on people to speak the names of those killed in the attacks.\nMore people died in Friday\u2019s mass shooting than are typically murdered in an entire year in New Zealand, which is the world\u2019s second-safest country, according to the 2018 Global Peace Index.\nAMY GOODMAN: For more, we\u2019re joined by Eva Nisa, a lecturer in religious studies at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. Her recent article for Middle East Eye is headlined \u201cNew Zealand has been a home to Muslims for centuries, and will remain so.\u201d\nEva Nisa, first, our condolences for this terrible massacre, this atrocity committed against the Muslim community, against the whole community of New Zealand. Can you talk about the origins of the Muslim community in your country?\nEVA NISA: OK. First of all, thank you very much for the deepest sympathy. Yeah, New Zealand migrants\u2014Muslims in New Zealand basically have been living here since the 18th century, 1769. We already\u2014New Zealanders already could see there\u2019s two Muslims came with the French vessel. But at that time, of course, Islam was not really like\u2014we couldn\u2019t see the clear face of Islam, because only two people, and they didn\u2019t settle, too. Only in the 1850s, then we could see one family from India came to New Zealand. And since then, we could see that the number of Muslims is also growing.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And could you also talk about what countries most of the Muslims who have migrated to New Zealand come from?\nEVA NISA: Basically, Muslims in New Zealand, I mean, their backgrounds, it\u2019s very\u2014it\u2019s ethnically diverse. But according to\u2014this is the very late census, a 1991 census, when there was a census regarding the ethnic backgrounds of Muslims. It mentioned that 49 percent of Muslims, they come from South Asian background, especially the Indian ethnic backgrounds. And mostly up to this time, most Muslims in New Zealand, we can say that they have Asian backgrounds, and then, after that, followed by Muslims from other countries, of course, other ethnicities.\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to turn to the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaking shortly after the attack about her phone call with President Trump.\nPRIME MINISTER JACINDA ARDERN: I spoke with Donald Trump this morning. He sought to call us directly. He very much wished for his condolences to be passed on to New Zealand. He asked what offer of support the United States could provide. My message was sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.\nAMY GOODMAN: Eva Nisa, your response?\nEVA NISA: Yeah, I think that\u2019s one of the things that have been mentioned a lot by New Zealanders. If Muslims are asked, \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\u2014even if Muslims are asked, \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d they will also say the same. We just need the love and support and also sympathy, because\u2014the other thing is, I think New Zealanders, we are very shocked with this kind of thing, because this never happened before. I mean, Jacinda Ardern mentioned this is an unprecedented tragedy, too. So, we don\u2019t need, let\u2019s say, a political kind of comment or some\u2014I mean, I know that some politicians, they have mentioned some comments, and then they have used this\u2014some of them even used this tragedy as part of their political tools to show that, look, there is this clash between Islam and Christianity, or Islam and the West. So, we don\u2019t need that kind of\u2014so, we need just love, support and sympathy.\nAMY GOODMAN: I also wanted to ask you about the response of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and how she\u2019s being praised, wearing a hijab, comforting the victims\u2019 families, and also, as you just said, talking about Muslims as \u201cus.\u201d This is the prime minister speaking on Friday.\nPRIME MINISTER JACINDA ARDERN: Many of those who will have been directly affected by the shooting may be migrants to New Zealand. They may even be refugees here. They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home. They are us. The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not. They have no place in New Zealand.\nAMY GOODMAN: And, of course, the prime minister\u2019s comments are being contrasted with President Trump. She made those comments on Friday. It wasn\u2019t hours later that President Trump signed the veto on Congress trying to stop his wall on the border, where he used the same terms that were used in the assailant\u2019s manifesto, the assassin\u2019s manifesto, referring to immigrants as \u201cinvaders,\u201d immigrants coming over the border as an \u201cinvasion.\u201d Eva Nisa, can you talk about the response of your prime minister, the youngest woman leader in the world?\nEVA NISA: Yeah. I think Jacinda\u2019s\u2014I mean, most New Zealanders, we are very happy with the comments made by our prime minister, Jacinda Arden. The hashtag #UnityIsPower and \u201cNew Zealand is home for the migrants\u201d always has been repeated a lot. And New Zealand has been very committed to open its gate for migrants, especially\u2014I mean, lately, in 2015, the government committed that we would receive 750 Syrian refugees. And then, after that, the government added the number of the quota to 1,000 Syrian refugees. So, that\u2019s one of the things that needs to be underlined, that New Zealand is basically\u2014we are committed to welcome refugees and to make them feel that New Zealand is their home. That\u2019s why that kind of stuff is\u2014it\u2019s very important.\nAnd the other thing regarding Jacinda Arden with the veil, that\u2019s also one of the things mentioned a lot, that many Muslims feel like this kind of support, I mean, a small gesture like this, means a lot. And one of the things that is quite heartbreaking, on Sunday, there were these two young Muslims who were verbally abused, attacked by this man. And yeah, he said that, \u201cYou just go to your own country.\u201d But the good thing is, this man was drunk. So, it\u2019s one of the things that\u2014because, you know, when this kind of thing happened, there is this\u2014what we know as gendered Islamophobia. So, women, Muslim women, especially those who wear veil, they are visibly more recognizable as Muslims, so showing her support by wearing a veil, it means a lot for many Muslims here in New Zealand.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And, Eva Nisa, I wanted to ask you\u2014New Zealand has a relatively small Muslim population, about, I think, 1 percent of the country, compared to Australia, that has a much larger percentage, or even, obviously, all of Western Europe. Have you seen a rise in white supremacist expressions or public statements in New Zealand over the past few years?\nEVA NISA: Yeah. Many analysts and also scholars have mentioned that for the\u2014there is an increase in this kind of hate speech, especially comes from white supremacists, and especially for the last two decades. Some scholars mention that one. And some Muslims, also Muslims that mention, too, that especially post-9/11, there is\u2014I mean, that happens in many countries. I mean, I know that in the United States this also happened, and there\u2019s an increase in hate speech. So, we are facing that one, too. But it\u2019s very difficult to confirm, because, of course, we don\u2019t have a record. There\u2019s no\u2014up to this time, we don\u2019t have hate law in here, in New Zealand.\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to quote Anjum Rahman, a spokeswoman with the Islamic Women\u2019s Council of New Zealand, who wrote in an op-ed that the council\u2019s growing fears about Islamophobia and the rise of the right in New Zealand were ignored by the government for years. She writes, quote, \u201c[W]e talked about the effects of discrimination, the issues in our communities, the rise of the alt-right and the increasing level of vitriol we were seeing online and in person. \u2026 We begged and pleaded, we demanded. We knocked on every door we could, we spoke at every forum we were invited to. \u2026 My community wants and needs accountability,\u201d she said.\nAnd I wanted to end with Waleed Aly, the Muslim host of an Australian news program, The Project. Here he is, speaking Friday, just hours after the massacres. The video has received millions of views.\nWALEED ALY: You\u2019ll have to forgive me. These won\u2019t be my best words. The truth is, I don\u2019t want to be talking today. When I was asked if it\u2019s something that I wanted to do, I resisted it all day, until, finally I had this overwhelming sense that it was somehow my responsibility to do so. \u2026 I went to the mosque today. I do that every Friday, just like the people in those mosques in Christchurch today. I know exactly what those moments before the shooting began would have been like. I know how quiet, how still, how introspective those people would have been, before they were suddenly gunned down. \u2026 If you\u2019ve been talking about being tough on terrorism for years in the communities that allegedly support it, show us how tough you are now. For mine, I\u2019m going to say the same thing I said about four years ago, after a horrific Islamist attack. Now? Now we come together. Now we understand this is not a game. Terrorism doesn\u2019t choose its victims selectively, that we are one community, and that everything we say to try to tear people apart, demonize particular groups, set them against each other, that all has consequences, even if we\u2019re not the ones with our fingers on the trigger.\nAMY GOODMAN: Waleed Aly, the Muslim host of the Australian news program The Project. And we want to thank Eva Nisa, the lecturer in religious studies at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. We\u2019ll link to her piece in Middle East Eye, headlined \u201cNew Zealand has been a home to Muslims for centuries, and will remain so.\u201d\nThis is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.

Congressmember Omar&rsquo;s comments were originally taken out of context and circulated by right-wing media, from The Daily Caller to Fox News. Congressmember Omar said in a statement, &ldquo;This is endangering lives. It has to stop.&rdquo; We speak with Moustafa Bayoumi, the author of &ldquo;This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror.&rdquo; His Guardian article is headlined &ldquo;Ilhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.&rdquo; Bayoumi is an English professor at Brooklyn College at the City University of New York. He is also the author of &ldquo;How Does It Feel to Be a Problem? Being Young and Arab in America.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> This is <em>Democracy Now!</em>, democracynow.org, <em>The War and Peace Report</em>. I&rsquo;m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz&aacute;lez.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> Well, Minnesota freshman Congressmember Ilhan Omar says death threats against her have spiked in number since President Trump tweeted a video juxtaposing her image with footage of the 9/11 attacks. Trump posted the 43-second video Friday with the caption, &ldquo;WE WILL NEVER FORGET.&rdquo; The president&rsquo;s tweet intercut video of the World Trade Center towers burning with video of Omar speaking about the increasing attacks on the Muslim American community after 9/11. Omar was speaking at a Council on American-Islamic Relations event last month.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>REP. ILHAN OMAR:</strong> Far too long, we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen. And frankly, I&rsquo;m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> CAIR was in fact founded in 1994. Omar&rsquo;s spokesperson later said she misspoke and, quote, &ldquo;meant to refer to the fact that the organization had doubled in size after the Sept. 11 attacks,&rdquo; end of quote. Congressmember Omar&rsquo;s comments were originally taken out of context and circulated by right-wing media, from <em>The Daily Caller</em> to Fox News. In a statement, Congressmember Omar said, quote, &ldquo;Since the president&rsquo;s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life&mdash;many directly referencing or replying to the president&rsquo;s video. This is endangering lives. It has to stop.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> The hashtag #StandWithIlhan trended as conservative voices continued to attack Congressmember Omar over the weekend. Trump said on Twitter Monday he&rsquo;s heading to Minnesota. Omar tweeted, &ldquo;The Great State of Minnesota, where we don&rsquo;t only welcome immigrants, we send them to Washington #NoBanAct.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In New York City, Yemeni bodega owners responded to the attacks against Congressmember Omar by announcing they&rsquo;re boycotting the sale and purchase of the <em>New York Post</em> over its front-page attack on Omar. The Murdoch-owned daily paper featured an image of the burning Twin Towers on 9/11, referencing Omar&rsquo;s comment out of context, &ldquo;9/11 Was 'Some People Did Something,'&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Your Something&rdquo; in large print over the photo. The Yemeni American Merchants Association said the cover &ldquo;provoked hatred&rdquo; and targeted people of the Muslim faith.</p>\n<p>To talk more about Congressmember Ilhan Omar, we&rsquo;re joined by Moustafa Bayoumi, the author of <em>This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror</em>, his recent <em>Guardian</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/14/ilhan-omar-republicans-silence\">piece</a> headlined &ldquo;Ilhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.&rdquo; Moustafa Bayoumi is an English professor at Brooklyn College in the City University of New York, also the author of <em>How Does It Feel to Be a Problem? Being Young and Arab in America</em>.</p>\n<p>Welcome back to <em>Democracy Now!</em> It&rsquo;s great to have you with us. Talk about what others have said over time. This is the argument you make in your piece, &ldquo;Ilhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.&rdquo; Give us a few quotes.</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> Sure. Well, I mean, if you think&mdash;if you just have even a short-term memory, I think you can remember that George W. Bush, the former president of the United States, said something to the effect of&mdash;when referring to the 9/11 attackers, said something to the effect of, &ldquo;Well, these folks committed this act.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Wait. Actually, we&rsquo;ve got that clip.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:</strong> &hellip; full resources of the federal government go to help the victims and their families and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> &ldquo;To find the folks who committed this act.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> Yeah. So, that, in&mdash;to my ear, that sounds quite similar to what Ilhan Omar said. And, in fact, George Bush is saying it to the whole country, and he&rsquo;s not considered to be anti-American for that statement whatsoever. So, in fact, I think what Ilhan Omar is saying is completely within the boundaries of what is normal political discourse in this country. And we could go one. That&rsquo;s one example.</p>\n<p>Another example would be Ilhan Omar is now accused of claiming that&mdash;her detractors will say that she claims that Jewish people in the United States suffer from a dual loyalty campaign. Well, in fact, actually, she did not say that. So, I think it&rsquo;s important to qualify what she did say and what she did not say. She talked about questions of allegiance. And if we listen to your last segment and we talk about anti-BDS laws, in fact, those are in fact allegiance laws that are built into now the very system of the United States. However, somebody did say something that was in fact claiming dual loyalty for Jewish Americans, and that would be our president now, Donald Trump.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Explain what he said.</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> He said something to the effect of&mdash;when speaking to a Jewish American group, he said something about&mdash;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> The Jewish Republican Coalition in Las Vegas last week.</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> In fact, that&rsquo;s right. And he said, &ldquo;Well, let me talk about your prime minister.&rdquo; So he referred to Benjamin Netanyahu as their prime minister.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> How do you account for this enormous campaign that has been launched against this freshman congressmember in terms of by so many conservatives and right-wing groups in the country and by the president himself? In your sense, what&rsquo;s behind it?</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> Well, on one level, it&rsquo;s very clear. Ilhan Omar is one of two Muslim women elected to Congress, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. That gives her, I think, a certain level of prominence, along with a certain level of vulnerability. Not only that, but, of course, being openly Muslim, she wears hijab. She covers her hair. She&rsquo;s a refugee. She&rsquo;s an immigrant. She&rsquo;s a black woman. So she occupies all of those vulnerable positions in our society today.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not only that, I believe, if you ask me, because if she were a quiet black refugee woman from Somalia, Muslim who covered her hair, and all of that stuff, then I think people would love to trot her out for the optics alone. But she&rsquo;s not a quiet congresswoman. In fact, I think that&rsquo;s a great thing. In fact, she seems to be a highly principled and highly effective politician, even just in the short time that she&rsquo;s been in Congress. So, I think that, in fact, she&rsquo;s a scary figure to a lot of people who are on the right, and even sometimes to the mainstream establishment of the Democratic Party, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> That was going to be my follow-up. What about the reaction of the establishment of the Democratic Party to the threats against her and to the scapegoating of her?</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> Yes. Well, you know, I think that what we saw was in fact, in some ways, a litmus test of where the Democratic leadership and also those vying for the presidency lie on one of the more important issues of our day, which is Islamophobia, fundamentally. What we saw with Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s statement, for example, on Ilhan Omar was, I thought, extremely disappointing. I thought she was refusing to name Ilhan Omar explicitly, was not&mdash;didn&rsquo;t come out in her defense, and in fact was backhandedly accusing her of sacralizing&mdash;or, desacralizing, I should say, the 9/11 territory, which was not the point of this controversy at all. So, I thought that Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s response was, in fact, quite shameful.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And now she&rsquo;s being attacked for criticizing Stephen Miller for his fierce anti-immigrant views, being told that because she&rsquo;s talking about Stephen Miller in the administration, she is singling out a Jewish member of the administration, which proves she is anti-Semitic. We had on Dr. David Glosser, who is Stephen Miller&rsquo;s uncle, his sister&rsquo;s son, who criticized his nephew for his extremist anti-immigrant views.</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> Yeah, exactly. I mean, does that mean that Ilhan Omar can only criticize Ilhan Omar? That would be the natural result of that. She&rsquo;s not criticizing Stephen Miller for his Jewishness. She&rsquo;s criticizing Stephen Miller for the positions that he holds. And that&rsquo;s completely within the boundaries of American political discourse.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> So what does this mean for Muslims around the country? Ilhan Omar says she herself has faced this spike in death threats against her. President Trump pinning the tweet of the video where he&rsquo;s juxtaposed the 9/11 attacks with Ilhan Omar? We know about the attacks on the Tree of Life synagogue, the 11 Jewish worshipers that were killed, with the killer citing the same words that President Trump used&mdash;&rdquo;invaders,&rdquo; &ldquo;invasion.&rdquo; President Trump&rsquo;s words and what he tweets has meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> Absolutely. In fact, there was a study that was performed last year&mdash;that was published last year, that said that there&rsquo;s a direct correlation with Donald Trump&rsquo;s anti-Muslim tweets and the rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes. So, Twitter and hate crimes, unfortunately, are connected. And they&rsquo;re not only connected in the United States, they&rsquo;re connected internationally, as well. That&rsquo;s what the study found. And, in fact, not only is what Donald Trump tweeted completely disturbing, but it&rsquo;s also coming within weeks of 50 people being killed in New Zealand in two different mosques by a man who also felt himself connected to President Trump and his ideology.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And let&rsquo;s not forget what the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern responded to President Trump when he asked what can he do, when he called the prime minister, and she said, &ldquo;Respect the Muslim community,&rdquo; as she then put on hijab herself to comfort the families of those killed.

Congressmember Omar\u2019s comments were originally taken out of context and circulated by right-wing media, from The Daily Caller to Fox News. Congressmember Omar said in a statement, \u201cThis is endangering lives. It has to stop.\u201d We speak with Moustafa Bayoumi, the author of \u201cThis Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror.\u201d His Guardian article is headlined \u201cIlhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.\u201d Bayoumi is an English professor at Brooklyn College at the City University of New York. He is also the author of \u201cHow Does It Feel to Be a Problem? Being Young and Arab in America.\u201d\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Well, Minnesota freshman Congressmember Ilhan Omar says death threats against her have spiked in number since President Trump tweeted a video juxtaposing her image with footage of the 9/11 attacks. Trump posted the 43-second video Friday with the caption, \u201cWE WILL NEVER FORGET.\u201d The president\u2019s tweet intercut video of the World Trade Center towers burning with video of Omar speaking about the increasing attacks on the Muslim American community after 9/11. Omar was speaking at a Council on American-Islamic Relations event last month.\nREP. ILHAN OMAR: Far too long, we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen. And frankly, I\u2019m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: CAIR was in fact founded in 1994. Omar\u2019s spokesperson later said she misspoke and, quote, \u201cmeant to refer to the fact that the organization had doubled in size after the Sept. 11 attacks,\u201d end of quote. Congressmember Omar\u2019s comments were originally taken out of context and circulated by right-wing media, from The Daily Caller to Fox News. In a statement, Congressmember Omar said, quote, \u201cSince the president\u2019s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life\u2014many directly referencing or replying to the president\u2019s video. This is endangering lives. It has to stop.\u201d\nAMY GOODMAN: The hashtag #StandWithIlhan trended as conservative voices continued to attack Congressmember Omar over the weekend. Trump said on Twitter Monday he\u2019s heading to Minnesota. Omar tweeted, \u201cThe Great State of Minnesota, where we don\u2019t only welcome immigrants, we send them to Washington #NoBanAct.\u201d\nIn New York City, Yemeni bodega owners responded to the attacks against Congressmember Omar by announcing they\u2019re boycotting the sale and purchase of the New York Post over its front-page attack on Omar. The Murdoch-owned daily paper featured an image of the burning Twin Towers on 9/11, referencing Omar\u2019s comment out of context, \u201c9/11 Was 'Some People Did Something,'\u201d and the words \u201cHere\u2019s Your Something\u201d in large print over the photo. The Yemeni American Merchants Association said the cover \u201cprovoked hatred\u201d and targeted people of the Muslim faith.\nTo talk more about Congressmember Ilhan Omar, we\u2019re joined by Moustafa Bayoumi, the author of This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror, his recent Guardian piece headlined \u201cIlhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.\u201d Moustafa Bayoumi is an English professor at Brooklyn College in the City University of New York, also the author of How Does It Feel to Be a Problem? Being Young and Arab in America.\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! It\u2019s great to have you with us. Talk about what others have said over time. This is the argument you make in your piece, \u201cIlhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.\u201d Give us a few quotes.\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Sure. Well, I mean, if you think\u2014if you just have even a short-term memory, I think you can remember that George W. Bush, the former president of the United States, said something to the effect of\u2014when referring to the 9/11 attackers, said something to the effect of, \u201cWell, these folks committed this act.\u201d\nAMY GOODMAN: Wait. Actually, we\u2019ve got that clip.\nPRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: \u2026 full resources of the federal government go to help the victims and their families and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act.\nAMY GOODMAN: \u201cTo find the folks who committed this act.\u201d\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yeah. So, that, in\u2014to my ear, that sounds quite similar to what Ilhan Omar said. And, in fact, George Bush is saying it to the whole country, and he\u2019s not considered to be anti-American for that statement whatsoever. So, in fact, I think what Ilhan Omar is saying is completely within the boundaries of what is normal political discourse in this country. And we could go one. That\u2019s one example.\nAnother example would be Ilhan Omar is now accused of claiming that\u2014her detractors will say that she claims that Jewish people in the United States suffer from a dual loyalty campaign. Well, in fact, actually, she did not say that. So, I think it\u2019s important to qualify what she did say and what she did not say. She talked about questions of allegiance. And if we listen to your last segment and we talk about anti-BDS laws, in fact, those are in fact allegiance laws that are built into now the very system of the United States. However, somebody did say something that was in fact claiming dual loyalty for Jewish Americans, and that would be our president now, Donald Trump.\nAMY GOODMAN: Explain what he said.\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: He said something to the effect of\u2014when speaking to a Jewish American group, he said something about\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: The Jewish Republican Coalition in Las Vegas last week.\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: In fact, that\u2019s right. And he said, \u201cWell, let me talk about your prime minister.\u201d So he referred to Benjamin Netanyahu as their prime minister.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: How do you account for this enormous campaign that has been launched against this freshman congressmember in terms of by so many conservatives and right-wing groups in the country and by the president himself? In your sense, what\u2019s behind it?\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Well, on one level, it\u2019s very clear. Ilhan Omar is one of two Muslim women elected to Congress, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. That gives her, I think, a certain level of prominence, along with a certain level of vulnerability. Not only that, but, of course, being openly Muslim, she wears hijab. She covers her hair. She\u2019s a refugee. She\u2019s an immigrant. She\u2019s a black woman. So she occupies all of those vulnerable positions in our society today.\nBut it\u2019s not only that, I believe, if you ask me, because if she were a quiet black refugee woman from Somalia, Muslim who covered her hair, and all of that stuff, then I think people would love to trot her out for the optics alone. But she\u2019s not a quiet congresswoman. In fact, I think that\u2019s a great thing. In fact, she seems to be a highly principled and highly effective politician, even just in the short time that she\u2019s been in Congress. So, I think that, in fact, she\u2019s a scary figure to a lot of people who are on the right, and even sometimes to the mainstream establishment of the Democratic Party, as well.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: That was going to be my follow-up. What about the reaction of the establishment of the Democratic Party to the threats against her and to the scapegoating of her?\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yes. Well, you know, I think that what we saw was in fact, in some ways, a litmus test of where the Democratic leadership and also those vying for the presidency lie on one of the more important issues of our day, which is Islamophobia, fundamentally. What we saw with Nancy Pelosi\u2019s statement, for example, on Ilhan Omar was, I thought, extremely disappointing. I thought she was refusing to name Ilhan Omar explicitly, was not\u2014didn\u2019t come out in her defense, and in fact was backhandedly accusing her of sacralizing\u2014or, desacralizing, I should say, the 9/11 territory, which was not the point of this controversy at all. So, I thought that Nancy Pelosi\u2019s response was, in fact, quite shameful.\nAMY GOODMAN: And now she\u2019s being attacked for criticizing Stephen Miller for his fierce anti-immigrant views, being told that because she\u2019s talking about Stephen Miller in the administration, she is singling out a Jewish member of the administration, which proves she is anti-Semitic. We had on Dr. David Glosser, who is Stephen Miller\u2019s uncle, his sister\u2019s son, who criticized his nephew for his extremist anti-immigrant views.\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yeah, exactly. I mean, does that mean that Ilhan Omar can only criticize Ilhan Omar? That would be the natural result of that. She\u2019s not criticizing Stephen Miller for his Jewishness. She\u2019s criticizing Stephen Miller for the positions that he holds. And that\u2019s completely within the boundaries of American political discourse.\nAMY GOODMAN: So what does this mean for Muslims around the country? Ilhan Omar says she herself has faced this spike in death threats against her. President Trump pinning the tweet of the video where he\u2019s juxtaposed the 9/11 attacks with Ilhan Omar? We know about the attacks on the Tree of Life synagogue, the 11 Jewish worshipers that were killed, with the killer citing the same words that President Trump used\u2014\u201dinvaders,\u201d \u201cinvasion.\u201d President Trump\u2019s words and what he tweets has meaning.\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Absolutely. In fact, there was a study that was performed last year\u2014that was published last year, that said that there\u2019s a direct correlation with Donald Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim tweets and the rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes. So, Twitter and hate crimes, unfortunately, are connected. And they\u2019re not only connected in the United States, they\u2019re connected internationally, as well. That\u2019s what the study found. And, in fact, not only is what Donald Trump tweeted completely disturbing, but it\u2019s also coming within weeks of 50 people being killed in New Zealand in two different mosques by a man who also felt himself connected to President Trump and his ideology.\nAMY GOODMAN: And let\u2019s not forget what the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern responded to President Trump when he asked what can he do, when he called the prime minister, and she said, \u201cRespect the Muslim community,\u201d as she then put on hijab herself to comfort the families of those killed. We want to thank you, Moustafa Bayoumi, for being here, author of This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror, professor at Brooklyn College.

That&rsquo;s the name of the movement shutting down Central London this week in a series of direct actions, as activists close bridges, occupy public landmarks and even superglue themselves to buildings to demand urgent action to combat climate change. Police have arrested more than 300 people so far, and the protests are continuing. Today, activists have halted trains at Canary Wharf&mdash;a financial hub of the city&mdash;with two protesters climbing a train car and another supergluing his hand to a train window. We speak to Clare Farrell, one of the co-founders of the environmental action group Extinction Rebellion, and Farhana Yamin, international environmental lawyer who helped draft the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. On Tuesday, she was arrested after gluing both of her hands to the ground outside the Shell building in Central London.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> Extinction Rebellion. That&rsquo;s the name of the movement shutting down Central London this week in a series of direct actions as activists close bridges, occupy public landmarks and even superglue themselves to buildings to demand urgent action to combat climate change. Police have arrested more than 300 people so far, and the protests are continuing. Today, activists have halted trains at Canary Wharf&mdash;a financial hub of the city&mdash;with two protesters climbing a train car and another supergluing his hand to a train window. Earlier this week, protesters shut down Waterloo Bridge and Oxford Circus, with others supergluing themselves to the British headquarters of the Shell Oil Company. This is Farhana Yamin, a leading climate lawyer and Extinction Rebellion activist who superglued her hands to the pavement in front of the Shell building.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>FARHANA YAMIN:</strong> Stop lobbying governments to delay action. These prove to me that the legal process is pretty broken right now. And we&rsquo;re having to break law rather than make law, because of the inaction of 30 years now of these companies.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> In a separate act of nonviolent civil disobedience, four activists glued and chained themselves under a vehicle parked on the Waterloo Bridge. This is climate activist Ben Moss.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>BEN MOSS:</strong> We glued ourselves to this so that this vehicle could not be moved by the police last night. The reason why we&rsquo;re doing that is that we want to secure this bridge as part of the actions for Extinction Rebellion. We&rsquo;re doing this because we want the government to take action about the climate crisis, about the ecological collapse that we&rsquo;re facing. There has been too much inaction. There has been inaction for too long. And so we&rsquo;re taking radical action to make sure that the government acts on what is our collective responsibility.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> The protests are taking place across Europe and around the world as part of a week-long campaign organized by Extinction Rebellion. The group started in the United Kingdom just last year and has now spread to dozens of countries. The growing collective of activists are demanding governments commit to legally binding measures to slash consumption, reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 and create a citizens&rsquo; assembly to oversee progress.</p>\n<p>Environmental journalist and activist George Monbiot wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/15/rebellion-prevent-ecological-apocalypse-civil-disobedience\">column</a> for <em>The Guardian</em>, &ldquo;The success of this mobilisation depends on us. It will reach the critical threshold only if enough of us cast aside denial and despair, and join this exuberant, proliferating movement. The time for excuses is over. The struggle to overthrow our life-denying system has begun,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>For more, we go to London, where we&rsquo;re joined by two guests: Clare Farrell, one of the co-founders of the environmental action group Extinction Rebellion, and we&rsquo;re joined by Farhana Yamin, a leading environmental lawyer, who helped negotiate the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. She has now joined the rebellion. She was arrested after supergluing herself to the Shell headquarters in London yesterday.</p>\n<p>We welcome you both to <em>Democracy Now!</em> Farhana, let&rsquo;s begin with you. You&rsquo;re just out of jail. Can you explain what you did yesterday, why you got arrested?</p>\n<p><strong>FARHANA YAMIN:</strong> Yeah. I joined the mass civil disobedience that has started in London beginning on Monday, and I did it because of the inaction of companies like Shell, who have funded campaigns of misinformation and lobbied governments to not take action, which is why we&rsquo;re here at this critical time. And just to let you know, that this mass civil disobedience is happening all around the world, and, today especially, Extinction Rebellion is standing in solidarity with all of those people who have been fighting climate injustice from around the world. I think there are around 50 countries that are involved in the international support for the rebellion that&rsquo;s taking here in London, and each one of those is fighting against land degradation, against human rights abuses and against the toxicity and pollution in their own countries. So we salute all of those movements out in the rest of the world. Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> And, Clare Farrell, as co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, could you talk about the urgency that you and the supporters of your movement feel right now and why you felt it so necessary to do this massive civil disobedience?</p>\n<p><strong>CLARE FARRELL:</strong> Well, yes. As Farhana says, it&rsquo;s been well over 30 years of denial and time wasting, really, and we&rsquo;ve pushed ourselves up against the edge of a window of time frame that we have to act. And, you know, carbon emissions are still going up. They&rsquo;re set to go up again this year. So, globally, the facts are quite clear that we&rsquo;re on a catastrophic course, and we&rsquo;ve wasted a huge amount of time. We&rsquo;re not prepared to stand by and watch us waste the very small window that we have left.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Farhana Yamin, can you describe the action yesterday?</p>\n<p><strong>FARHANA YAMIN:</strong> The action actually started on Monday with protesters climbing onto the facade&mdash;there&rsquo;s a balcony&mdash;outside the unmarked building, which is the Shell headquarters in the U.K. And they honored the work of Polly Higgins, who has been campaigning for ecocide law, which is essentially to hold to account companies and governments for the criminal damage to the Earth. And I protested there yesterday as that action was ending, because I feel, you know, it&rsquo;s absurd that I was walking off in handcuffs for criminal damage to the Shell building, when Shell itself has been one of the main biggest polluters who has caused the largest amount of irreversible, very serious harm that is happening all around the world, the climate destruction that we&rsquo;re seeing as a result of 30 years of too little, too late.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> You glued your hands?</p>\n<p><strong>FARHANA YAMIN:</strong> I did, yeah. And it&rsquo;s the very first time that I&rsquo;ve done anything like this, so I, yeah, probably used a little bit too much superglue, and they were completely bolted down on the pavement. I had tried to get to the door, but that wasn&rsquo;t possible.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> And what was the reaction of the police to this relatively new tactic of supergluing of the various protesters? How were they able to finally get you free?</p>\n<p><strong>FARHANA YAMIN:</strong> Well, the supergluing actions have been going on for some time, actually, and so I don&rsquo;t think I did anything particularly new, other than to do that myself. And there are special solvents that they use, and the police acted with utter professionalism and courtesy. So, for me, the most important thing was to stand in solidarity with all of the people around the world who are seeing climate devastation, especially in developing countries. That&rsquo;s who I&rsquo;ve acted for in the climate change negotiations&mdash;the small island states, the least-developed countries, especially those in Africa, who are seeing the consequences of water shortages and will be experiencing, and already are, famines and droughts that are directly implicated by climate change.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> You&rsquo;re certainly acting in every arena, Farhana Yamin. You helped draft the 2015 Paris Agreement, credited with getting the goal of net-zero emissions by mid-century into the agreement, acting on behalf of the small island nations. Can you talk about why you&rsquo;ve moved from working inside the system, this agreement that you helped forge, to direct action?</p>\n<p><strong>FARHANA YAMIN:</strong> Well, we need those laws. We have got those laws&mdash;you know, the Paris Agreement; in the U.K., we have the Climate Change Act. But they&rsquo;re not delivering enough, and they&rsquo;re not going fast enough. And in many parts of the world, as you know, in the U.S., Amy, that things are going backwards. We have laws that were put in place that are being repealed or being challenged or being disassembled by fossil fuel interests. So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve added the word &ldquo;activist&rdquo; to what I do as a lawyer.</p>\n<p>I feel every signal person is now called upon to join Extinction Rebellion&rsquo;s call for mass civil disobedience, to see that everyone is needed, to shout out very loudly and boldly, wherever they are in the system, and to not just think that this is somebody else&rsquo;s day job, you know? I&rsquo;m absolutely committed to the legal process. I believe in the rule of law. I&rsquo;ll carry on writing and advising, you know, when I can. But right now I feel the most important thing that people can do is come and join us on the streets, come and join whatever rebellion is taking place near you. If there isn&rsquo;t one, set one up. It&rsquo;s a very decentralized movement.</p>\n<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s very similar, in some ways, what&rsquo;s happening here&mdash;we had 1.6 million students around the world on the 12th of March, in nearly every country in the world. You&rsquo;ve got the Sunrise Movement in the U.S. I think people are beginning to wake up and understand that we, sadly, have to take different measures and slightly extraordinary measures than rely on our elected politicians, that hasn&rsquo;t delivered so far.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> And, Clare Farrell, could you elaborate on the core demands of your movement to the government&mdash;tell the truth about climate change, reduce carbon emissions by 2025 and create citizens&rsquo; assemblies to oversee the process?</p>\n<p><strong>CLARE FARRELL:</strong> Yeah, sure. So, the first demand, on tell the truth, is that we think that because of the grave risk that everybody faces, there should be a public information campaign, which should be the responsibility of any government, to educate the people if they&rsquo;re in danger, and also to work with other institutions, possibly also the media, whatever it takes, the education sector, to get people to really come up to speed and understand the position that they&rsquo;re in.</p>\n<p>The second demand for net-zero carbon emissions by 2025 has been amended. I believe it also now includes a rapid addressing of the biodiversity crisis.</p>\n<p>And the third demand, which I think, personally, is kind of the most exciting, is for a citizens&rsquo; assembly on climate change and the extinction crisis. And what that calls for is a structural political change, which I think is crucial for people to understand. Often when you&rsquo;re interviewed on the mainstream media here, they want to drill down into policy, and they particularly want to talk about what the environmentalists want to take away from them. And, for me, this is absolutely giving something to people in a very big and serious way. And if it happens structurally, then it&rsquo;s not a policy that can be, you know, massaged figures or whatever. It&rsquo;s something that, hopefully, will stand to last and significantly restore our democratic process in the U.K.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And, Clare Farrell, why you named it Extinction&mdash;why the group has decided on this name, Extinction Rebellion, and what your plans are, going forward from today?</p>\n<p><strong>CLARE FARRELL:</strong> Well, I was part of a very long process, actually, to finalize the name. It was quite challenging. I mean, the &ldquo;Rebellion&rdquo; part was quite straightforward, because we had been over it, and technically that&rsquo;s what we were going to organize. The &ldquo;Extinction&rdquo; part, I think, is extremely useful, because it helps us not only to reframe the crisis and to name the&mdash;you know, the scientific community has admitted that human extinction is a possibility now, but also it feels like it sort of takes it away from just being a climate change debate, and it helps us to talk about the broader picture, which is that we face multiple crises at the moment, and the extinction event is a big part of that. Even if we could fix climate change tomorrow, we&rsquo;re still losing life at a rate which I think our society and our species can&rsquo;t really survive. So, yeah, that&rsquo;s on the name.</p>\n<p>And as for the plans coming up, I know that some people climbed on board the&mdash;on top of the train today at the DLR station. There are some groups on the street who&mdash;I understand, today, Oxford Circus is just receiving a much heavier police presence, and there are lots of arrests. But there will be groups going out and swarming London&rsquo;s streets, which basically means going and moving, doing mobile, kind of agile and temporary roadblocks, moving around the city. So, if sites do get closed down, groups will be blocking roads in many, many places around the center of London, close to the sites that we&rsquo;ve already seen closed down for the last few days.</p>\n<p><strong>CLARE FARRELL:</strong> Just to say, this is the start of a campaign of mass civil disobedience. The intention is that it isn&rsquo;t over after a few days, but the intention is that, you know, it will catalyze and inspire others to take forward their own actions and become a big mass movement all over the world. So, I hope, in the months and weeks beyond this, that we will see many, many more actions coming up.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> And, Clare, the impact of all of these student strikes that have occurred? And, of course, the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, 16 years old, is expected to meet with the Pope Francis today. How has that affected sort of the face of the movement around climate change?</p>\n<p><strong>CLARE FARRELL:</strong> Well, the youth movement is very important. And I think when you look at&mdash;when you look at a movement or a moment in history like this, having many movements that support each other is really important. And I had a very interesting conversation recently with the researcher Erica Chenoweth, and she described something in the States which was interesting, that the children who walked out of school over gun control, actually, if you look at the disruptive nature of disobedience and direct action, you know, when those kids walked out of school, they took up the time of the police, they stopped their teachers from doing their jobs, and they pulled their parents out of their jobs, as well, to come and find them, pick them up. And so, for children to walk out of school is extremely powerful, and actually they have a huge capacity to disrupt the lives of the adults that they have contact with. And I believe that that&rsquo;s had a big impact on American politics, as well, lots of parents deciding to move into that space. So, it&rsquo;s really exciting to sort of think about the breadth of the impact and the long-term impact, I think, of the youth movement, as well as the energy and the sort of excitement that they also bring.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And finally, Farhana Yamin, as you were getting arrested, you said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re having to break law rather than make law.&rdquo; What message do you have to diplomats, to scientists around what needs to be done right now?</p>\n<p><strong>FARHANA YAMIN:</strong> Oh, come and join, everyone, as part of&mdash;become an activist, too. No one is saying stop doing science or stop doing diplomacy, but recognize that those are not going to deliver unless we fundamentally rewire our economies. And part of that means rewiring our political systems, which have not delivered. And those systems at the moment are hijacked or corrupted and too slow or, you know, obsessed with many other things. And it takes disruption of this kind to, frankly, push some of those things off the agenda and start focusing on the crisis that&rsquo;s affecting humanity. And that&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And your message to President Trump? Thirty seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>FARHANA YAMIN:</strong> Oh, President Trump, I think, is, in some ways, aware of how big the climate crisis is. I think he&rsquo;s just dealing with it in ways that sort of deny what can be done through the creativity and ingenuity of human beings, which is that we can transform our societies, and we can use renewable energies, we can use solidarity, we can use resilience and community building, to address all the impacts that we will have. I think that that&rsquo;s what happened with the moonshot. You know, we had lots of different technologies developed from that, that actually made us more prosperous and made us&mdash;you know, gave us hope. So, I hope that President Trump can put his faith in all the things that are going on in the U.S. economy to decarbonize it and to build resilience.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Farhana Yamin, we want to thank you for being with us, international environmental lawyer who helped draft the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, that President Trump is pulling the United States out of. She was arrested outside the Shell headquarters in London Tuesday after supergluing her hands to the ground. Clare Farrell is co-founder of Extinction Rebellion. They&rsquo;re both speaking to us from London.

                "text": "Extinction Rebellion. That\u2019s the name of the movement shutting down Central London this week in a series of direct actions, as activists close bridges, occupy public landmarks and even superglue themselves to buildings to demand urgent action to combat climate change. Police have arrested more than 300 people so far, and the protests are continuing. Today, activists have halted trains at Canary Wharf\u2014a financial hub of the city\u2014with two protesters climbing a train car and another supergluing his hand to a train window. We speak to Clare Farrell, one of the co-founders of the environmental action group Extinction Rebellion, and Farhana Yamin, international environmental lawyer who helped draft the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. On Tuesday, she was arrested after gluing both of her hands to the ground outside the Shell building in Central London.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Extinction Rebellion. That\u2019s the name of the movement shutting down Central London this week in a series of direct actions as activists close bridges, occupy public landmarks and even superglue themselves to buildings to demand urgent action to combat climate change. Police have arrested more than 300 people so far, and the protests are continuing. Today, activists have halted trains at Canary Wharf\u2014a financial hub of the city\u2014with two protesters climbing a train car and another supergluing his hand to a train window. Earlier this week, protesters shut down Waterloo Bridge and Oxford Circus, with others supergluing themselves to the British headquarters of the Shell Oil Company. This is Farhana Yamin, a leading climate lawyer and Extinction Rebellion activist who superglued her hands to the pavement in front of the Shell building.\nFARHANA YAMIN: Stop lobbying governments to delay action. These prove to me that the legal process is pretty broken right now. And we\u2019re having to break law rather than make law, because of the inaction of 30 years now of these companies.\nAMY GOODMAN: In a separate act of nonviolent civil disobedience, four activists glued and chained themselves under a vehicle parked on the Waterloo Bridge. This is climate activist Ben Moss.\nBEN MOSS: We glued ourselves to this so that this vehicle could not be moved by the police last night. The reason why we\u2019re doing that is that we want to secure this bridge as part of the actions for Extinction Rebellion. We\u2019re doing this because we want the government to take action about the climate crisis, about the ecological collapse that we\u2019re facing. There has been too much inaction. There has been inaction for too long. And so we\u2019re taking radical action to make sure that the government acts on what is our collective responsibility.\nAMY GOODMAN: The protests are taking place across Europe and around the world as part of a week-long campaign organized by Extinction Rebellion. The group started in the United Kingdom just last year and has now spread to dozens of countries. The growing collective of activists are demanding governments commit to legally binding measures to slash consumption, reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 and create a citizens\u2019 assembly to oversee progress.\nEnvironmental journalist and activist George Monbiot wrote in a column for The Guardian, \u201cThe success of this mobilisation depends on us. It will reach the critical threshold only if enough of us cast aside denial and despair, and join this exuberant, proliferating movement. The time for excuses is over. The struggle to overthrow our life-denying system has begun,\u201d he said.\nFor more, we go to London, where we\u2019re joined by two guests: Clare Farrell, one of the co-founders of the environmental action group Extinction Rebellion, and we\u2019re joined by Farhana Yamin, a leading environmental lawyer, who helped negotiate the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. She has now joined the rebellion. She was arrested after supergluing herself to the Shell headquarters in London yesterday.\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Farhana, let\u2019s begin with you. You\u2019re just out of jail. Can you explain what you did yesterday, why you got arrested?\nFARHANA YAMIN: Yeah. I joined the mass civil disobedience that has started in London beginning on Monday, and I did it because of the inaction of companies like Shell, who have funded campaigns of misinformation and lobbied governments to not take action, which is why we\u2019re here at this critical time. And just to let you know, that this mass civil disobedience is happening all around the world, and, today especially, Extinction Rebellion is standing in solidarity with all of those people who have been fighting climate injustice from around the world. I think there are around 50 countries that are involved in the international support for the rebellion that\u2019s taking here in London, and each one of those is fighting against land degradation, against human rights abuses and against the toxicity and pollution in their own countries. So we salute all of those movements out in the rest of the world. Thank you.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And, Clare Farrell, as co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, could you talk about the urgency that you and the supporters of your movement feel right now and why you felt it so necessary to do this massive civil disobedience?\nCLARE FARRELL: Well, yes. As Farhana says, it\u2019s been well over 30 years of denial and time wasting, really, and we\u2019ve pushed ourselves up against the edge of a window of time frame that we have to act. And, you know, carbon emissions are still going up. They\u2019re set to go up again this year. So, globally, the facts are quite clear that we\u2019re on a catastrophic course, and we\u2019ve wasted a huge amount of time. We\u2019re not prepared to stand by and watch us waste the very small window that we have left.\nAMY GOODMAN: Farhana Yamin, can you describe the action yesterday?\nFARHANA YAMIN: The action actually started on Monday with protesters climbing onto the facade\u2014there\u2019s a balcony\u2014outside the unmarked building, which is the Shell headquarters in the U.K. And they honored the work of Polly Higgins, who has been campaigning for ecocide law, which is essentially to hold to account companies and governments for the criminal damage to the Earth. And I protested there yesterday as that action was ending, because I feel, you know, it\u2019s absurd that I was walking off in handcuffs for criminal damage to the Shell building, when Shell itself has been one of the main biggest polluters who has caused the largest amount of irreversible, very serious harm that is happening all around the world, the climate destruction that we\u2019re seeing as a result of 30 years of too little, too late.\nAMY GOODMAN: You glued your hands?\nFARHANA YAMIN: I did, yeah. And it\u2019s the very first time that I\u2019ve done anything like this, so I, yeah, probably used a little bit too much superglue, and they were completely bolted down on the pavement. I had tried to get to the door, but that wasn\u2019t possible.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And what was the reaction of the police to this relatively new tactic of supergluing of the various protesters? How were they able to finally get you free?\nFARHANA YAMIN: Well, the supergluing actions have been going on for some time, actually, and so I don\u2019t think I did anything particularly new, other than to do that myself. And there are special solvents that they use, and the police acted with utter professionalism and courtesy. So, for me, the most important thing was to stand in solidarity with all of the people around the world who are seeing climate devastation, especially in developing countries. That\u2019s who I\u2019ve acted for in the climate change negotiations\u2014the small island states, the least-developed countries, especially those in Africa, who are seeing the consequences of water shortages and will be experiencing, and already are, famines and droughts that are directly implicated by climate change.\nAMY GOODMAN: You\u2019re certainly acting in every arena, Farhana Yamin. You helped draft the 2015 Paris Agreement, credited with getting the goal of net-zero emissions by mid-century into the agreement, acting on behalf of the small island nations. Can you talk about why you\u2019ve moved from working inside the system, this agreement that you helped forge, to direct action?\nFARHANA YAMIN: Well, we need those laws. We have got those laws\u2014you know, the Paris Agreement; in the U.K., we have the Climate Change Act. But they\u2019re not delivering enough, and they\u2019re not going fast enough. And in many parts of the world, as you know, in the U.S., Amy, that things are going backwards. We have laws that were put in place that are being repealed or being challenged or being disassembled by fossil fuel interests. So that\u2019s why I\u2019ve added the word \u201cactivist\u201d to what I do as a lawyer.\nI feel every signal person is now called upon to join Extinction Rebellion\u2019s call for mass civil disobedience, to see that everyone is needed, to shout out very loudly and boldly, wherever they are in the system, and to not just think that this is somebody else\u2019s day job, you know? I\u2019m absolutely committed to the legal process. I believe in the rule of law. I\u2019ll carry on writing and advising, you know, when I can. But right now I feel the most important thing that people can do is come and join us on the streets, come and join whatever rebellion is taking place near you. If there isn\u2019t one, set one up. It\u2019s a very decentralized movement.\nAnd, you know, it\u2019s very similar, in some ways, what\u2019s happening here\u2014we had 1.6 million students around the world on the 12th of March, in nearly every country in the world. You\u2019ve got the Sunrise Movement in the U.S. I think people are beginning to wake up and understand that we, sadly, have to take different measures and slightly extraordinary measures than rely on our elected politicians, that hasn\u2019t delivered so far.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And, Clare Farrell, could you elaborate on the core demands of your movement to the government\u2014tell the truth about climate change, reduce carbon emissions by 2025 and create citizens\u2019 assemblies to oversee the process?\nCLARE FARRELL: Yeah, sure. So, the first demand, on tell the truth, is that we think that because of the grave risk that everybody faces, there should be a public information campaign, which should be the responsibility of any government, to educate the people if they\u2019re in danger, and also to work with other institutions, possibly also the media, whatever it takes, the education sector, to get people to really come up to speed and understand the position that they\u2019re in.\nThe second demand for net-zero carbon emissions by 2025 has been amended. I believe it also now includes a rapid addressing of the biodiversity crisis.\nAnd the third demand, which I think, personally, is kind of the most exciting, is for a citizens\u2019 assembly on climate change and the extinction crisis. And what that calls for is a structural political change, which I think is crucial for people to understand. Often when you\u2019re interviewed on the mainstream media here, they want to drill down into policy, and they particularly want to talk about what the environmentalists want to take away from them. And, for me, this is absolutely giving something to people in a very big and serious way. And if it happens structurally, then it\u2019s not a policy that can be, you know, massaged figures or whatever. It\u2019s something that, hopefully, will stand to last and significantly restore our democratic process in the U.K.\nAMY GOODMAN: And, Clare Farrell, why you named it Extinction\u2014why the group has decided on this name, Extinction Rebellion, and what your plans are, going forward from today?\nCLARE FARRELL: Well, I was part of a very long process, actually, to finalize the name. It was quite challenging. I mean, the \u201cRebellion\u201d part was quite straightforward, because we had been over it, and technically that\u2019s what we were going to organize. The \u201cExtinction\u201d part, I think, is extremely useful, because it helps us not only to reframe the crisis and to name the\u2014you know, the scientific community has admitted that human extinction is a possibility now, but also it feels like it sort of takes it away from just being a climate change debate, and it helps us to talk about the broader picture, which is that we face multiple crises at the moment, and the extinction event is a big part of that. Even if we could fix climate change tomorrow, we\u2019re still losing life at a rate which I think our society and our species can\u2019t really survive. So, yeah, that\u2019s on the name.\nAnd as for the plans coming up, I know that some people climbed on board the\u2014on top of the train today at the DLR station. There are some groups on the street who\u2014I understand, today, Oxford Circus is just receiving a much heavier police presence, and there are lots of arrests. But there will be groups going out and swarming London\u2019s streets, which basically means going and moving, doing mobile, kind of agile and temporary roadblocks, moving around the city. So, if sites do get closed down, groups will be blocking roads in many, many places around the center of London, close to the sites that we\u2019ve already seen closed down for the last few days.\nCLARE FARRELL: Just to say, this is the start of a campaign of mass civil disobedience. The intention is that it isn\u2019t over after a few days, but the intention is that, you know, it will catalyze and inspire others to take forward their own actions and become a big mass movement all over the world. So, I hope, in the months and weeks beyond this, that we will see many, many more actions coming up.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And, Clare, the impact of all of these student strikes that have occurred? And, of course, the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, 16 years old, is expected to meet with the Pope Francis today. How has that affected sort of the face of the movement around climate change?\nCLARE FARRELL: Well, the youth movement is very important. And I think when you look at\u2014when you look at a movement or a moment in history like this, having many movements that support each other is really important. And I had a very interesting conversation recently with the researcher Erica Chenoweth, and she described something in the States which was interesting, that the children who walked out of school over gun control, actually, if you look at the disruptive nature of disobedience and direct action, you know, when those kids walked out of school, they took up the time of the police, they stopped their teachers from doing their jobs, and they pulled their parents out of their jobs, as well, to come and find them, pick them up. And so, for children to walk out of school is extremely powerful, and actually they have a huge capacity to disrupt the lives of the adults that they have contact with. And I believe that that\u2019s had a big impact on American politics, as well, lots of parents deciding to move into that space. So, it\u2019s really exciting to sort of think about the breadth of the impact and the long-term impact, I think, of the youth movement, as well as the energy and the sort of excitement that they also bring.\nAMY GOODMAN: And finally, Farhana Yamin, as you were getting arrested, you said, \u201cWe\u2019re having to break law rather than make law.\u201d What message do you have to diplomats, to scientists around what needs to be done right now?\nFARHANA YAMIN: Oh, come and join, everyone, as part of\u2014become an activist, too. No one is saying stop doing science or stop doing diplomacy, but recognize that those are not going to deliver unless we fundamentally rewire our economies. And part of that means rewiring our political systems, which have not delivered. And those systems at the moment are hijacked or corrupted and too slow or, you know, obsessed with many other things. And it takes disruption of this kind to, frankly, push some of those things off the agenda and start focusing on the crisis that\u2019s affecting humanity. And that\u2019s\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: And your message to President Trump? Thirty seconds.\nFARHANA YAMIN: Oh, President Trump, I think, is, in some ways, aware of how big the climate crisis is. I think he\u2019s just dealing with it in ways that sort of deny what can be done through the creativity and ingenuity of human beings, which is that we can transform our societies, and we can use renewable energies, we can use solidarity, we can use resilience and community building, to address all the impacts that we will have. I think that that\u2019s what happened with the moonshot. You know, we had lots of different technologies developed from that, that actually made us more prosperous and made us\u2014you know, gave us hope. So, I hope that President Trump can put his faith in all the things that are going on in the U.S. economy to decarbonize it and to build resilience.\nAMY GOODMAN: Farhana Yamin, we want to thank you for being with us, international environmental lawyer who helped draft the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, that President Trump is pulling the United States out of. She was arrested outside the Shell headquarters in London Tuesday after supergluing her hands to the ground. Clare Farrell is co-founder of Extinction Rebellion.

Trump reportedly had the exchange with McAleenan during a visit to the border in Calexico, California, when he was the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, just two days before Trump promoted him to fill the post left vacant by ousted DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\nThe House Judiciary Committee is also seeking documents related to a March 21 meeting between Trump and Nielsen about reinstating Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d family separation policy and shutting down the U.S.-Mexico border. The deadline to respond to the committee\u2019s request is April 30.",

The War Powers Resolution was passed by the House earlier this month, following its passage in the Senate last month, with seven Republicans joining minority Democrats. It was the first time Congress has invoked the War Powers Act of 1973 to end a U.S. president&rsquo;s unilateral decision to wage war abroad.</p>\n<p>Congressmember Ro Khanna, who brought the bill before the House, said in a statement, &ldquo;The Yemen War Powers Resolution was a bipartisan, bicameral effort &hellip; and supported by some of the president&rsquo;s most trusted Republican allies. This resolution nonetheless was a major win. It sends a clear signal to the Saudis that they need to lift their blockade and allow humanitarian assistance into Yemen if they care about their relationship with Congress. [It] will also caution this and future administrations from going to war without first seeking authorization from Congress.&rdquo; Bernie Sanders, who led the effort to pass the resolution in the Senate, said via Twitter he was disappointed but not surprised by the veto, adding, &ldquo;The people of Yemen desperately need humanitarian help, not more bombs.&rdquo;</p>",

The War Powers Resolution was passed by the House earlier this month, following its passage in the Senate last month, with seven Republicans joining minority Democrats. It was the first time Congress has invoked the War Powers Act of 1973 to end a U.S. president\u2019s unilateral decision to wage war abroad.\nCongressmember Ro Khanna, who brought the bill before the House, said in a statement, \u201cThe Yemen War Powers Resolution was a bipartisan, bicameral effort \u2026 and supported by some of the president\u2019s most trusted Republican allies. This resolution nonetheless was a major win. It sends a clear signal to the Saudis that they need to lift their blockade and allow humanitarian assistance into Yemen if they care about their relationship with Congress. [It] will also caution this and future administrations from going to war without first seeking authorization from Congress.\u201d Bernie Sanders, who led the effort to pass the resolution in the Senate, said via Twitter he was disappointed but not surprised by the veto, adding, \u201cThe people of Yemen desperately need humanitarian help, not more bombs.\u201d",

The court suggested the U.S.'s lack of cooperation with the investigation was behind the decision. Earlier this month, the U.S. government revoked the visa of the ICC's chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda. This came after the Trump administration announced it would bar entry to any ICC investigators probing alleged war crimes by the U.S. military in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> A 2016 report by the International Criminal Court accused the U.S. military of torturing at least 61 prisoners in Afghanistan during the ongoing war. The report also accused the CIA of subjecting at least 27 prisoners to torture, including rape, at CIA prison sites in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania.</p>\n<p>For more, we&rsquo;re joined by Katherine Gallagher, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights. She filed victims&rsquo; representations with the Pre-Trial Chamber in support of the investigation.</p>\n<p>Welcome to <em>Democracy Now!</em> What&rsquo;s happened here?</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE GALLAGHER:</strong> Well, what we saw on Friday was a very dangerous decision from the Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC. It was profoundly misguided. If what the Pre-Trial Chamber claims it wanted to do was bolster the credibility of the International Criminal Court and operate in the interests of justice, including the interests of victims, it went in the opposite direction. The only people who could be applauding this decision, frankly, are Donald Trump and John Bolton.</p>\n<p>You had victims&rsquo; groups from Afghanistan, victims&rsquo; representations of individuals who were detained as part of the U.S. torture program, file victims&rsquo; representations on behalf of tens of thousands of people. Back in the winter of 2017, 2018, Afghan civil society groups literally risked their lives to collect victims&rsquo; representations, to say, &ldquo;Make this investigation go forward. End impunity.&rdquo; The same happened in my case of getting victims&rsquo; representations from two men who continue to be detained in Guant&aacute;namo. We all said that this investigation is in the interests of justice. And the Pre-Trial Chamber, bizarrely, frankly, said it is not. One can only conclude that this is the result of some serious political pressure by the United States, including not only on the court, but member states of the court.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> Well, I wanted to ask you about the implications. It&rsquo;s not just the Trump administration, but, clearly, some former Bush officials, like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, are also glad these days of this decision. But what&rsquo;s the implication of the ability of the U.S. government to effectively intimidate an international body like this?</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE GALLAGHER:</strong> And that&rsquo;s precisely why it&rsquo;s such a dangerous decision. It sends the message that bullying works. So, whether for Russia, who right now is looking to be investigated for Georgia and Ukraine, whether for Israel&mdash;of course, Palestine joined the ICC&mdash;this says, &ldquo;Obstruct, and you will be rewarded with impunity.&rdquo; So, I think, for the member states, of whom there are 122, who believe in international justice, they need to send the clear message, &ldquo;We back the court, and this investigation should proceed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> President Trump applauded the decision, saying in a statement, &ldquo;Since the creation of the ICC, the United States has consistently declined to join the court because of its broad, unaccountable prosecutorial powers; the threat it poses to American sovereignty; and other deficiencies that render it illegitimate. Any attempt to target American, Israeli, or allied personnel for prosecution will be met with a swift and vigorous response.&rdquo; And explain the response. For example, what happened with one of the ICC judges?</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE GALLAGHER:</strong> Sure. So, a couple of things to unpack there. First of all, it&rsquo;s true the United States is not a member state of the ICC. The reason why individuals can come within the jurisdiction of the court is because the U.S. chose to operate on the territory of member states. It chose to set up black sites, detention centers, commit acts of torture. So, it has brought itself, through its actions of a global rendition and torture program, into the purview of the ICC.</p>\n<p>In terms of responses from the court, we did see statements made, but I frankly don&rsquo;t think we saw a strong enough response for member states. That includes those states in Eastern Europe&mdash;Lithuania, Poland and Romania&mdash;and the other European states, or Jordan or Djibouti, states that are implicated in ways of furthering the torture program. What did they say to the ICC prosecutor? Did they pledge their support? That, I think, is something that we want to see happen, if this appeal, which we understand the prosecutor will be filing, will go forward.</p>\n<p>And in terms of U.S. officials, you mentioned Dick Cheney and George Bush. There&rsquo;s George Tenet. These are all individuals who could be within the scope of the investigation. There&rsquo;s also Gina Haspel. She&rsquo;s a person who ran a black site, not in Afghanistan, as far as we know, but she is now the head of the CIA, for a president who we&rsquo;ve seen, time and time again, does not believe in the rule of law, and believes that he is above the law. So, when he has Gina Haspel running the CIA right now, we have to ask: What is happening in other countries around the world? What is it that they don&rsquo;t want investigated? These are not crimes only of the past.</p>\n<p>And if you ask Afghan civil society, they will say this also gives a green light to the Taliban. The purported reason for why the U.S. went to endless war in Afghanistan was to protect Afghan civilians. And with this decision, it&rsquo;s done the absolute opposite. It&rsquo;s empowered impunity and empowered warlords.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Katie Gallagher, I wanted to switch topics. Trump issued the second veto of his presidency Tuesday, blocking a congressional effort to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians, leading to the greatest humanitarian catastrophe in the world. Your response?</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE GALLAGHER:</strong> Well, we saw, finally, a very, very late response from Congress, saying, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of the business of assisting war crimes and crimes against humanity&rdquo;&mdash;what has been happening against Yemeni civilians for years now. And in the face of finally saying, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop backing Saudi Arabia,&rdquo; this is what Donald Trump did. It is, again, another example of lawlessness, of impunity, of a lack of care about civilians, of individuals. It&rsquo;s more cruelty. So&hellip;</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> And in the little time we have left, Attorney General Barr&rsquo;s decision&mdash;directive to immigration judges to deny bond to those who are seeking&mdash;who are detained and are seeking asylum in the United States?</p>\n<p><strong>KATHERINE GALLAGHER:</strong> Well, the first reaction would be to remind everyone that asylum&mdash;seeking asylum is not a crime. And, in fact, under international conventions, like the Refugee Convention or the Convention Against Torture, which prohibits sending a person back to a place where they&rsquo;ll be tortured, it is actually a right. It is a human right to seek asylum. And what the Trump administration, through Barr&rsquo;s proposal, is setting forth is something that, again, is unbound by law, both international law and contrary to U.S. law, which says that asylum seekers and people&mdash;people&mdash;deserve due process. So, it&rsquo;s, again, another truly lawless and cruel move.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Well, we want to thank you so much for being with us, Katherine Gallagher, senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights.</p>\n<p>That does it for our broadcast today.

The court suggested the U.S.'s lack of cooperation with the investigation was behind the decision. Earlier this month, the U.S. revoked the visa of the ICC's chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda. A 2016 report by the ICC accused the U.S. military of torturing at least 61 prisoners in Afghanistan during the ongoing war. The report also accused the CIA of subjecting at least 27 prisoners to torture, including rape, at CIA prison sites in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania. We speak to Katherine Gallagher, senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Well, the International Criminal Court has announced it will not investigate possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the United States and other actors in Afghanistan. The court suggested the U.S.'s lack of cooperation with the investigation was behind the decision. Earlier this month, the U.S. government revoked the visa of the ICC's chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda. This came after the Trump administration announced it would bar entry to any ICC investigators probing alleged war crimes by the U.S. military in Afghanistan.\nAMY GOODMAN: A 2016 report by the International Criminal Court accused the U.S. military of torturing at least 61 prisoners in Afghanistan during the ongoing war. The report also accused the CIA of subjecting at least 27 prisoners to torture, including rape, at CIA prison sites in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania.\nFor more, we\u2019re joined by Katherine Gallagher, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights. She filed victims\u2019 representations with the Pre-Trial Chamber in support of the investigation.\nWelcome to Democracy Now! What\u2019s happened here?\nKATHERINE GALLAGHER: Well, what we saw on Friday was a very dangerous decision from the Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC. It was profoundly misguided. If what the Pre-Trial Chamber claims it wanted to do was bolster the credibility of the International Criminal Court and operate in the interests of justice, including the interests of victims, it went in the opposite direction. The only people who could be applauding this decision, frankly, are Donald Trump and John Bolton.\nYou had victims\u2019 groups from Afghanistan, victims\u2019 representations of individuals who were detained as part of the U.S. torture program, file victims\u2019 representations on behalf of tens of thousands of people. Back in the winter of 2017, 2018, Afghan civil society groups literally risked their lives to collect victims\u2019 representations, to say, \u201cMake this investigation go forward. End impunity.\u201d The same happened in my case of getting victims\u2019 representations from two men who continue to be detained in Guant\u00e1namo. We all said that this investigation is in the interests of justice. And the Pre-Trial Chamber, bizarrely, frankly, said it is not. One can only conclude that this is the result of some serious political pressure by the United States, including not only on the court, but member states of the court.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Well, I wanted to ask you about the implications. It\u2019s not just the Trump administration, but, clearly, some former Bush officials, like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, are also glad these days of this decision. But what\u2019s the implication of the ability of the U.S. government to effectively intimidate an international body like this?\nKATHERINE GALLAGHER: And that\u2019s precisely why it\u2019s such a dangerous decision. It sends the message that bullying works. So, whether for Russia, who right now is looking to be investigated for Georgia and Ukraine, whether for Israel\u2014of course, Palestine joined the ICC\u2014this says, \u201cObstruct, and you will be rewarded with impunity.\u201d So, I think, for the member states, of whom there are 122, who believe in international justice, they need to send the clear message, \u201cWe back the court, and this investigation should proceed.\u201d\nAMY GOODMAN: President Trump applauded the decision, saying in a statement, \u201cSince the creation of the ICC, the United States has consistently declined to join the court because of its broad, unaccountable prosecutorial powers; the threat it poses to American sovereignty; and other deficiencies that render it illegitimate. Any attempt to target American, Israeli, or allied personnel for prosecution will be met with a swift and vigorous response.\u201d And explain the response. For example, what happened with one of the ICC judges?\nKATHERINE GALLAGHER: Sure. So, a couple of things to unpack there. First of all, it\u2019s true the United States is not a member state of the ICC. The reason why individuals can come within the jurisdiction of the court is because the U.S. chose to operate on the territory of member states. It chose to set up black sites, detention centers, commit acts of torture. So, it has brought itself, through its actions of a global rendition and torture program, into the purview of the ICC.\nIn terms of responses from the court, we did see statements made, but I frankly don\u2019t think we saw a strong enough response for member states. That includes those states in Eastern Europe\u2014Lithuania, Poland and Romania\u2014and the other European states, or Jordan or Djibouti, states that are implicated in ways of furthering the torture program. What did they say to the ICC prosecutor? Did they pledge their support? That, I think, is something that we want to see happen, if this appeal, which we understand the prosecutor will be filing, will go forward.\nAnd in terms of U.S. officials, you mentioned Dick Cheney and George Bush. There\u2019s George Tenet. These are all individuals who could be within the scope of the investigation. There\u2019s also Gina Haspel. She\u2019s a person who ran a black site, not in Afghanistan, as far as we know, but she is now the head of the CIA, for a president who we\u2019ve seen, time and time again, does not believe in the rule of law, and believes that he is above the law. So, when he has Gina Haspel running the CIA right now, we have to ask: What is happening in other countries around the world? What is it that they don\u2019t want investigated? These are not crimes only of the past.\nAnd if you ask Afghan civil society, they will say this also gives a green light to the Taliban. The purported reason for why the U.S. went to endless war in Afghanistan was to protect Afghan civilians. And with this decision, it\u2019s done the absolute opposite. It\u2019s empowered impunity and empowered warlords.\nAMY GOODMAN: Katie Gallagher, I wanted to switch topics. Trump issued the second veto of his presidency Tuesday, blocking a congressional effort to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians, leading to the greatest humanitarian catastrophe in the world. Your response?\nKATHERINE GALLAGHER: Well, we saw, finally, a very, very late response from Congress, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of the business of assisting war crimes and crimes against humanity\u201d\u2014what has been happening against Yemeni civilians for years now. And in the face of finally saying, \u201cLet\u2019s stop backing Saudi Arabia,\u201d this is what Donald Trump did. It is, again, another example of lawlessness, of impunity, of a lack of care about civilians, of individuals. It\u2019s more cruelty. So\u2026\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And in the little time we have left, Attorney General Barr\u2019s decision\u2014directive to immigration judges to deny bond to those who are seeking\u2014who are detained and are seeking asylum in the United States?\nKATHERINE GALLAGHER: Well, the first reaction would be to remind everyone that asylum\u2014seeking asylum is not a crime. And, in fact, under international conventions, like the Refugee Convention or the Convention Against Torture, which prohibits sending a person back to a place where they\u2019ll be tortured, it is actually a right. It is a human right to seek asylum. And what the Trump administration, through Barr\u2019s proposal, is setting forth is something that, again, is unbound by law, both international law and contrary to U.S. law, which says that asylum seekers and people\u2014people\u2014deserve due process. So, it\u2019s, again, another truly lawless and cruel move.\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, we want to thank you so much for being with us, Katherine Gallagher, senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights.\nThat does it for our broadcast today.

                "html": "<p><em>This report is the second in a series examining the magnitude of the teacher shortage and the working conditions and other factors that contribute to the shortage.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What this series finds: </strong>The teacher shortage is real, large and growing, and worse than we thought. When indicators of teacher quality (certification, relevant training, experience, etc.) are taken into account, the shortage is even more acute than currently estimated, with high-poverty schools suffering the most from the shortage of credentialed teachers.</p>\n<p><strong>What this report finds</strong>: This report describes the challenges schools face in staffing themselves, both as a consequence of the teacher shortage and further contributing to it. It shows that a high share of public school teachers are leaving their posts: 13.8 percent are either leaving their school or leaving teaching altogether, according to most recent data. It also shows that schools are having a harder time filling the vacancies that turnover, attrition, and other factors (like increasing student enrollment or broadened curriculums) create. The share of schools that were trying to fill a vacancy but couldn&rsquo;t tripled from the 2011&ndash;2012 to 2015&ndash;2016 school years (increasing from 3.1 to 9.4 percent), and in the same period the share of schools that found it very difficult to fill a vacancy nearly doubled (from 19.7 to 36.2 percent). These difficulties are also shaped by a dwindling pool of applicants to fill vacancies. From the 2008&ndash;2009 to 2015&ndash;2016 school years, there was a 15.4 percent drop in the number of education degrees awarded and a 27.4 percent drop in the number of people who completed a teacher preparation program. Schools are also having a harder time retaining credentialed teachers: that can be seen in the small but growing share of all teachers who are newly hired and in their first year of teaching (4.7 percent) and in the substantial shares of teachers who quit who are certified and experienced. All these challenges are more acute for high-poverty schools.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>A shortage of teachers harms students, teachers, and the public education system as a whole. Lack of sufficient, qualified teachers and the staff instability that accompanies turnover threaten students&rsquo; ability to learn and reduce teachers&rsquo; effectiveness, and high teacher turnover consumes economic resources that could be better deployed elsewhere. The teacher shortage makes it more difficult to build a solid reputation for teaching and to professionalize it, which further contributes to perpetuating the shortage. In addition, the fact that the shortage is distributed so unevenly among students of different socioeconomic backgrounds challenges the U.S. education system&rsquo;s goal of providing a sound education equitably to all children.</p>\n<p><strong>What we can do about it: </strong>Tackle the working conditions and other factors that are prompting teachers to quit and dissuading people from entering the profession, thus making it harder for school districts to retain and attract highly qualified teachers: low pay, a challenging school environment, and weak professional development support and recognition. In addition to tackling these factors for all schools, we must provide extra supports and funding to high-poverty schools, where teacher shortages are even more of a problem.</p>\n<p><i><em><strong>Update, October 2019: </strong></em>EPI analyses in this report are produced with 2011&ndash;2012 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) data), 2012&ndash;2013 Teacher Follow-Up Survey (TFS) data, and 2015&ndash;2016 National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS) school-level data, and are unaffected by the National Center for Education Statistics&rsquo; reexamination of weights developed for the teacher data in the 2015&ndash;2016 NTPS used in other reports in this series.</i></p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The teacher shortage in the nation&rsquo;s K&ndash;12 schools is an increasingly recognized but still poorly understood crisis: The shortage is recognized by the media and policymakers, and researchers have estimated the size of the shortage&mdash;about 110,000 teachers in the 2017&ndash;2018 school year, up from no shortage before 2013 (Sutcher, Darling-Hammond, and Carver-Thomas 2016).<a data-note_number=\"1\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">1</a> But the shortage is poorly understood because the reasons for it are complex and interdependent. The shortage occurs because there is an insufficient number of credentialed teachers to fill vacancies at schools. Unfilled vacancies happen for any number of reason, including reduced attractiveness of teaching as a profession, increases in school enrollment, reductions in class sizes, and excessive number of teachers leaving their schools. The teacher shortage constitutes a crisis because of its negative effects on students, teachers, and the education system at large. This crisis calls for urgent, comprehensive, and sustainable policy solutions.</p>\n<p>The first report in this series, <em><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/the-teacher-shortage-is-real-large-and-growing-and-worse-than-we-thought-the-first-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">The Teacher Shortage Is Real, Large and Growing, and Worse Than We Thought</a></em> (Garc&iacute;a and Weiss 2019a), established that current national estimates of the teacher shortage likely understate the magnitude of the problem: When issues such as teacher qualifications and the unequal distribution of highly credentialed teachers across high- and low-poverty schools are taken into consideration, the teacher shortage problem is much more severe than previously recognized. Building on that research, and using the same quality and equity angles, this paper examines challenges schools are facing in trying to recruit, hire, and retain sufficient, qualified teachers, with a particular focus on high-poverty schools, where those struggles are heightened.</p>\n<p>This report shows that schools&rsquo; staffing efforts are challenged by teachers leaving the profession at high rates and by the reduced pipeline of new teachers as fewer people have entered teaching preparedness pathways in recent years. We also present data suggesting that teachers entering the profession don&rsquo;t have the same qualifications their peers in years past had, due to the proliferation of nontraditional teacher preparation programs and changes in the requirements for obtaining an initial teaching certificate. We also show staffing trends are affecting the qualifications held by the teaching workforce overall: A lot of teachers quit teaching and some of the teachers who quit are as credentialed or more credentialed than the teachers who stay, and the share of all teachers who are inexperienced has increased over time.</p>\n<p>These challenges and changes in the aggregate qualification of the teaching labor force manifest in schools in many ways. Schools are reporting difficulties in staffing their schools and are leaving vacancies unfilled despite actively trying to hire for them. Over time the share of teachers who are newly hired has increased as has the share of teachers who are newly hired and in their first year of teaching. High-poverty schools are hit hardest: They find it harder to fill vacancies than low-poverty schools and schools overall, and they experience higher turnover and attrition than low-poverty schools. These findings suggest that efforts to address teacher shortages must consider how schools are affected by both teacher attrition and turnover and by the shrinking pipeline of new potential teachers and the factors that have eroded the appeal of&mdash;and regard for&mdash;teaching as a profession for both incoming and acting teachers.</p>\n<h2>How do struggles to recruit and hire drive the teacher shortage, and why is the shortage a concern?</h2>\n<p>For schools, the teacher shortage manifests in their inability to staff themselves with teachers who have qualifications appropriate to their specific needs. The number of new teachers a school needs and the qualifications those teachers must have depend on the subject matter and courses the school needs to offer, the size and characteristics of the student body, the state or district requirements that broadened the curriculum or reduced class sizes, the vacancies generated by teachers who left the school or the profession, and other &ldquo;supply and demand&rdquo; drivers.<a data-note_number=\"2\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">2</a></p>\n<p>Net of some of the external or institutional factors just mentioned, the staffing problem arises when vacancies occur against a backdrop of high rates of teacher attrition (teachers quitting teaching altogether) and turnover (teachers leaving their position to another position or school) and a shrinking pool of new teachers with the needed qualifications due to a waning interest in a teaching career. Indeed, high attrition and a dwindling pool of applicants are the two most troubling dynamics of the education labor market and are largely driving the teacher shortage and hence are largely responsible for the costs and consequences of the teacher shortage (Ingersoll 2004, 2014; Sutcher, Darling-Hammond, and Carver-Thomas 2016; Darling-Hammond et al. 2017).</p>\n<p>As we saw in the first report, the shortage imposes real costs on teachers themselves, on students, on schools, and on the education system at large. In addition to the economic cost of replacing teachers who are leaving (Carroll 2007; Carver-Thomas and Darling-Hammond 2017; LPI 2017), there are performance costs when highly qualified teachers leave schools. High absolute and net teacher turnover&mdash;i.e., overall and when comparing the shares of teachers who leave a school with the share who arrive&mdash;harms both the morale of those teachers who stay, and the cohesion of the school as a whole, which makes sense given the central role teachers play in one another&rsquo;s decisions regarding curriculum, instruction, student assessment, and school governance and policy (Sorensen and Ladd 2018; Kraft and Papay 2014). Net turnover increases a school&rsquo;s share of inexperienced teachers who are not fully certified or credentialed to teach the subject to which they are assigned, and turnover begets further turnover, substantially weakening the overall quality and ability of the school&rsquo;s teacher pool (Sorensen and Ladd 2018).<a data-note_number=\"3\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">3</a> Turnover also depresses student achievement (Ronfeltd, Loeb, and Wyckoff 2013; Darling-Hammond 1999; Ladd and Sorensen 2016), especially in our highest-poverty schools, with &ldquo;turnover-induced loss of general and grade-specific experience&rdquo; as the main driver of declining student achievement (see Sorensen and Ladd 2018, 2, citing Hanushek, Rivkin, and Shiman 2016).<a data-note_number=\"4\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">4</a></p>\n<p>In this report, we examine the challenges schools face accessing a sufficient pool of qualified applicants, filling vacancies that arise, and retaining credentialed teachers. We also identify disparities in recruitment and attrition between high- and low-poverty schools, which should be expected, given the substantial disparities between working conditions in high-poverty schools and in low-poverty schools (as examined in the forthcoming reports in this series).</p>\n<h2>Challenges to recruiting and hiring credentialed teachers</h2>\n<p>How easy or hard it is for schools to recruit and hire strong teachers to fill open positions depends in part on the size and qualifications of the pool of potential new teachers. That is why changes to the pool of potential new teachers, to how well teachers in the pool were prepared, to what requirements they had to meet to access a teaching credential, and to the total number of teachers who need to be recruited all affect the ease or difficulty of filling openings in a school.</p>\n<h3>The pipeline of potential teachers is shrinking</h3>\n<p>The diminishing pool of applicants and changes in the characteristics of those applicants over time help to explain some of the challenges to recruitment. Schools will struggle to staff their ranks with well-prepared teachers if fewer individuals are attracted into teaching or if their training and preparation have weakened.</p>\n<p>While requirements vary state to state, generally someone must earn a bachelor&rsquo;s degree from an accredited institution and complete a teacher preparation program (or &ldquo;teacher certification program,&rdquo; as referred to in our last report) to be eligible to obtain a certificate to teach. (Teacher preparation programs prepare candidates to meet certification requirements but do not award certificates&mdash;only the state can do that. Candidates may complete a program but fail to pass the required certification tests or may fail to meet some other requirements to earn the certification.) All teachers need a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, but not all teachers need a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in education. However, a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in education is a common route into teaching because the teacher preparation program is completed as part of the education major. Persons who wish to be teachers but who did not major in education as an undergraduate may pursue a master&rsquo;s degree in education or may enroll in an alternative teacher preparation program. Teachers also pursue master&rsquo;s degrees and doctorates to advance their education. For these reasons, we can glean insights into the popularity of teaching and the strength of the teacher pipeline by looking at the number of people pursing education degrees and enrolling in teacher preparation programs (see footnote 6 and table notes for descriptions of the types of teacher preparation programs).</p>\n<p>Both the appeal of education as a discipline and the pool of potential new teachers shrank significantly between the 2008&ndash;2009 and 2015&ndash;2016 school years, as suggested by <strong>Figure A</strong>, which shows a dramatic drop in both the number of people awarded degrees in education and the number of people enrolling in and completing teacher preparation programs. From 2008&ndash;2009 to 2015&ndash;2016, the number of enrollees in teacher preparation programs fell 37.8 percent, and the number of people who completed teacher preparation programs fell 27.4 percent.<a data-note_number=\"5\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">5</a></p>\n<p><strong>Table 1</strong> further unpacks these sharp reductions and provides context. For example it shows that not only did the number of people awarded education degrees fall, the share of education degrees awarded as a percentage of all degrees awarded fell, with the exception of Ph.D.s. (Ph.D.s increased in both total number of degrees and as a share of degrees awarded but constitute a very small percentage of education degrees awarded.) Of all the bachelor&rsquo;s degrees awarded in 2015&ndash;2016, 4.5 percent were in the field of education; of all the master&rsquo;s degrees awarded, 18.6 percent were in education. These shares were 1.8 and 8.4 percentage points smaller than in 2008&ndash;2009, before the teacher shortage crisis developed. (During the 2008&ndash;2009 school year school systems were just starting to grapple with the economic recession, which led to big cuts in school spending that in some cases have yet to be fully restored, as noted in Leachman, Masterson and Figueroa 2017 and Leachman and Figueroa 2019). To put it another way, in percent terms, bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degrees in education awarded as a share of all degrees fell by roughly a third (28.5 percent and 31.2 percent, respectively) from 2008&ndash;2009 to 2015&ndash;2016.</p>\n<p>The table also shows negative but much more intense trends for enrollees in specific types of teacher preparation programs. Although, as shown above, overall enrollees decreased by 37.8 percent from 2008&ndash;2009 to 2015&ndash;2016, enrollees in traditional programs fell by 44.6 percent, and enrollees in alternative programs offered by institutions of higher education (IHEs) fell by 40.1 percent. When we look at the number of people who completed teacher preparation programs by program type, the changes by program type are closer. Overall, the number of completers decreased by 27.4 percent. Completers of alternative programs at institutions of higher education decreased the most (down by 29.6 percent), followed by completers of traditional programs (down by 27.8 percent), and by completers of alternative programs (down by 22.9 percent).<a data-note_number=\"6\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">6</a></p>\n<p>The aggregate numbers alone point to a reduction in the size of the pool of teachers. But the qualifications of that pool are also affected by the type and quality of the training of the applicants, which in turn can affect the effectiveness of novice teachers in the classrooms. As shown in the table, the increase of potential teachers who are enrolled in or who have completed alternative training programs is notable. Our first report in this series (Garc&iacute;a and Weiss 2019a) found a marked increase in the share of current teachers who had followed alternative routes into teaching between 2011&ndash;2012 and 2015&ndash;2016 (i.e., who went into teaching after completing an alternative teacher preparation program). Although the research on the quality of preparation programs is inconclusive, there are concerns associated with the proliferation of nontraditional programs (Fraser and Lefty 2018).<a data-note_number=\"7\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">7</a> Some of these concerns relate to the relative instability of nontraditional-entry teachers as members of the teaching workforce as alternative routes into teaching are associated with higher turnover (Redding and Smith 2016). <a data-note_number=\"8\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">8</a></p>\n<p>Other factors that influence the qualifications of the teacher workforce include changes in the standards for becoming a teacher such as licensure examinations and the requirements of preparation programs. Our exploration of Title II data from the U.S. Department of Education (2017c and 2017d) identifies certain trends that could negatively affect teacher qualifications (although more detailed qualitative work would be needed to assess the reasons for, and net impact of, the changes, which is beyond of the scope of this report).</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, we found that the number of states requiring content-specific bachelor&rsquo;s degrees for initial teaching credentials decreased. (If a state requires a content-specific bachelor&rsquo;s degree, that generally means that if a teacher is to teach a specific subject, such as math, the teacher must have majored in that subject.) Of states with data in 2008&ndash;2009 and 2015&ndash;2016, fewer states required a content-specific bachelor&rsquo;s for elementary, middle-level, and secondary level certificates in 2015&ndash;2016. Examining the requirements across all initial certificates available, we also noted a large decrease in the share initial teaching certificates requiring a content-specific bachelor&rsquo;s degree for middle school, which fell from 38.6 percent to 22.8 percent of all initial certificates, a 15.8 percentage-points decrease. Over the same period there were also drops in the share of initial certificates requiring performance assessments (down 16.2 percentage points), supervised clinical experience (down 10.8 percentage points), or a police record examination (down 17.2 percentage points) in order to earn a teaching certificate. However, there was an increase in the share of initial certificates requiring &ldquo;prescribed coursework&rdquo; (up 10.8 percentage points) in order to get a teaching certificate.</p>\n<h3>Hiring teachers is difficult, especially in high-poverty schools</h3>\n<p>Schools&rsquo; hiring patterns help explain the teacher shortage because they reflect the actual school-level need for teachers, the share of schools that are hiring (irrespective of the reasons), and challenges filling vacancies.<a data-note_number=\"9\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">9</a> Shortages arise when finding proper, qualified candidates is difficult or when some vacancies remain unfilled, and shortages grow if these circumstances become more challenging over time.<a data-note_number=\"10\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">10</a></p>\n<p>As shown in <strong>Table 2</strong>, a large majority of schools report having vacancies to fill, so most are hiring at a given time (about eight in 10 schools report having vacancies for the 2015&ndash;2016 school year). And nearly one in 10 (9.4 percent) of those schools that were trying to hire said they were unable to fill a vacancy in at least one field (math, English, etc.) in the 2015&ndash;2016 school year. Finally, over a third (36.2 percent) of schools trying to fill vacancies report finding it very difficult to fill a vacancy in at least one field.</p>\n<p>The data also show that while high-poverty schools were less likely to be hiring than their low-poverty counterparts (i.e., fewer of them reported having teaching vacancies for which teachers were recruited and interviewed), high-poverty schools <em>with</em> vacancies found it more difficult to hire teachers. Well over a third (36.8 percent) of high-poverty schools with vacancies reported that it was &ldquo;very difficult&rdquo; to fill at least one of their vacancies versus 34.3 percent of low-poverty schools.</p>\n<p>There are also differences between high- and low-poverty schools in the share that are unable to fill vacancies. While these differences are small in absolute terms, they are relatively large. For example, the share of high-poverty schools that had vacancies and report being unable to fill teaching positions in at least one field is 10.5 percent, but this share is greater than the 7.2 percent share in low-poverty schools.</p>\n<p>One consequence of this greater challenge in high-poverty schools is their higher share of brand new teachers and teachers who are new hires. Here our analysis coincides with what Sorensen and Ladd found in their 2018 study. The share of all teachers who were newly hired teachers (new to the school completing the survey) was 11.2 percent, on average, in the 2015&ndash;2016 school year (<strong>Table 3</strong>). But that share was two percentage points higher in high-poverty schools (12.1 percent versus 10.1 percent in low-poverty schools). And, when we look at the share of all teachers who are not only newly hired teachers but in their first year of teaching, we see again that the share is higher in high-poverty schools (5.3 percent versus 3.7 percent). Finally, in high-poverty schools, the share of newly hired teachers who are in their first year of teaching is much higher than in low-poverty schools (39.8 percent versus just 33.8 percent). Although the differences are small in relative terms, these three measures together point to an added source of disadvantage for low-income children and the schools that serve them.</p>\n<h3>Challenges to hiring teachers have increased over time</h3>\n<p>Not only is hiring a challenge, but the data show that it has become substantially harder in the past few years. First, the share of schools reporting any vacancy increased by more than 11 percentage points between the 2011&ndash;2012 and 2015&ndash;2016 school years (from 67.2 percent to 78.8 percent, top panel <strong>Figure B</strong>). Even more troubling, the share of schools that were trying to hire but reported an unfilled vacancy in at least one position tripled during this period (from 3.1 percent to 9.4 percent). And the share of hiring schools reporting that they had found it &ldquo;very difficult&rdquo; to fill at least one vacancy also increased&mdash;almost doubling (from 19.7 percent to 36.2 percent). Relatedly, the share of all teachers who were newly hired teachers increased between the 2011&ndash;2012 and 2015&ndash;2016 school years (from 7.2 percent to 11.2 percent), as did the share of all teachers who were newly hired and in their first year of teaching (from 4.0 percent to 4.7 percent), indicating that the teaching workforce became less experienced over this period.</p>\n<h2>Retaining credentialed teachers is difficult</h2>\n<p>Excessive attrition is another troubling dynamic plaguing teacher labor markets and a major driver of shortages (Ingersoll 2004, 2014; Sutcher, Darling-Hammond, and Carver-Thomas 2016; Darling-Hammond et al. 2017). Attrition and turnover&mdash;leaving the profession altogether or switching schools&mdash;are high in teaching in both absolute and relative terms. Turnover and attrition have been increasing over time (Goldring, Taie, and Riddles 2014) and are higher for U.S. teachers than among teachers in other countries (Darling-Hammond et al. 2017).<a data-note_number=\"11\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">11</a> Teachers see much higher attrition than their peers in most occupations: About 30 percent of college graduates who became teachers were not in the profession five years later, compared with 14 percent of pharmacists, 16 percent of engineers, and 19 percent of nurses and lawyers (Ingersoll 2014).<a data-note_number=\"12\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">12</a> Among the other professions Ingersoll described in his study, the only ones with higher attrition rates are secretaries, child care workers, paralegals, and correctional officers. It is worth noting that these other professions, with the exception of correctional officers, are very heavily female and relatively low paying, unlikely a coincidental association and one that affirms the findings in our later reports in this series about teachers&rsquo; insufficient pay, weak supports, and even lack of societal respect.</p>\n<h3>Teacher turnover and attrition rates are high, causing staff instability and increasing pressure to hire</h3>\n<p>After the 2011&ndash;2012 school year, 6.5 percent of teachers left the school but remained in the profession (the measure of turnover), and 7.3 percent left the teaching profession (the measure of attrition), for a total of 13.8 percent of teachers lost to turnover or attrition generating the potential need for a replacement (<strong>Figure C</strong>). As in other aspects of teacher shortages, however, rates vary between low- and high-poverty schools. In low-poverty schools, 88.1 percent of teachers who were teaching when the 2011&ndash;2012 Schools and Staffing Survey was administered were at the same school the following year, compared with 84.6 percent in high-poverty schools. To put it another way, the aggregate turnover and attrition rate is 15.3 in high-poverty schools&mdash;that&rsquo;s 3.4 percentage points higher than the aggregate turnover and attrition rate in low-poverty schools (11.9 percent), creating more potential vacancies in high-poverty schools than in better-off schools.<a data-note_number=\"13\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">13</a></p>\n<h3>Teacher turnover and attrition rates affect the overall qualifications of the teaching labor force</h3>\n<p>More data are needed to determine whether attrition causes certain schools to lose teachers with qualifications associated with effective teaching. As suggested by the literature and noted in our first paper in this series, overall, the credentials of teachers who stay in teaching are stronger than the credentials of teachers who quit the profession, which would indicate no leakage in teaching overall through attrition. <a data-note_number=\"14\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">14</a></p>\n<p><strong>Table 4</strong> provides a detailed look at the shares of teachers with various qualifications (certification, experience, and educational background, as in our first report) by teacher status, i.e., whether the teacher stays in the school, leaves the school but stays in the profession, or leaves teaching altogether. The table also provides shares of teachers with an additional qualification&mdash;certification by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) in at least one content area. (The NBPTS is a nongovernmental organization that administers National Board certification, a voluntary national assessment program that certifies teachers who demonstrate advanced knowledge, skills, and practice in their certificate area.)</p>\n<p>As the table shows, the qualifications of teachers who stay, leave the school, or quit the profession differ, but schools are not consistently losing strong credentials due to attrition, because the qualifications of teachers staying at the school are the strongest (with the exception of teachers who are NBTPS).<a data-note_number=\"15\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">15</a> On average, 92.1 percent of teachers who stay at the same school have a regular, state, or advanced professional certificate (i.e., are fully certified); 86.1 percent took a traditional route into teaching, 80.9 percent are experienced, and 69.5 percent have an educational background in the subject of main assignment. Among teachers who left the school or quit teaching, smaller shares are fully certified (88.1 percent and 90.3 percent, respectively), have taken a traditional route into teaching (82.5 percent and 82.9 percent), are experienced (66.1 percent and 77.2 percent), and have an educational background in the subject of main assignment (66.9 percent and 63.1 percent, respectively).<a data-note_number=\"16\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">16</a></p>\n<p>Earlier in this report we showed that turnover and attrition are higher in high-poverty schools (see discussion around Figure C). Here we discuss how turnover and attrition could be responsible for some leakage of credentials from high-poverty schools. One reason is the weaker link between higher credentials and retention in high-poverty schools. As we showed in our last paper in this series (see Garc&iacute;a and Weiss 2019a, particularly Table 2), while higher credentials deter attrition (in our analysis, shown descriptively, not causally), this link between quality and retention was weaker in high-poverty schools.<a data-note_number=\"17\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">17</a> Also, because, just as teachers who stay in high-poverty schools are less qualified than teachers who stay in low-poverty schools (Garc&iacute;a and Weiss 2019a, Figure D), teachers in high-poverty schools who end up quitting the profession are more qualified with respect to certification than teachers who in low-poverty schools who quit the profession. See Appendix Table 3, which replicates Table 2 from Garcia and Weiss 2019a; Appendix Figure A, which replicates Figure D in Garcia and Weiss 2019a; and Appendix Figure B, which provides data on teachers in high- and low-poverty schools who quit.<a data-note_number=\"18\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">18</a></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to determine exactly how the exit of credentialed teachers affects the qualifications of the teacher labor force overall and in high- and low-poverty schools because the qualifications of the overall teacher pool also depend on the qualifications of the teachers coming into the workforce and into these schools. But as Ladd and Sorensen (2018) find, &ldquo;all schools experiencing periods of high turnover are more likely to hire not-fully-licensed teachers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;schools serving large proportions of low-income student are much more likely to do so. Since schools serving high-poverty student populations already experience above average turnover rates, these differential impacts are particularly worrying&rdquo; (p. 20). In short, high-poverty schools would need to compensate for these negative trends by hiring greater shares of credentialed teachers to keep up with their wealthier counterparts, and we know that doing so would be extremely unlikely.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In practice, the teacher shortage manifests in schools as an inability to be staffed adequately. A school may need to hire more teachers for any one or more of the following reasons: school enrollment increases, teachers leave, the curriculum expands and teachers are needed in new fields, a policy reduces class size, the school&rsquo;s budget increases, etc. And for any reason or combination of reasons&mdash;insufficient teachers coming into teaching, excessive numbers of teachers quitting the profession because of worsening working conditions, etc.&mdash;those needed teachers are increasingly difficult for a school to find.<a data-note_number=\"19\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">19</a> This imbalance creates a shortage.</p>\n<p>This report focuses on the challenges schools face filling their vacancies (or meeting their staffing needs) primarily due to two trends: more teachers leaving schools and the profession and fewer people entering the teaching profession. It also raises three concerns on top of the leakage of teachers from the profession and the dwindling pool or potential new teachers. First is the potential change or decline in the qualifications of the teaching workforce, driven by increased churn (turnover and attrition) in the teacher labor market, by changes in the strength of the teaching preparation programs, by alterations in the requirements to accessing an initial teaching credential, and by the slight loss of credentialed teachers who leave the profession. Second is the increased difficulty that schools are having filling vacancies, which in turn has increased the pressure on schools to hire teachers with fewer credentials and thus affected the overall qualifications of the teaching workforce. Third is the fact the high-poverty schools are in an especially difficult position: they are more likely to have vacancies and have a hard time filling vacancies, they are more likely to fill positions with newly hired teachers (and newly hired teachers in their first year of teaching), their teachers are more likely to leave the school or leave the profession, and, as shown in Garc&iacute;a and Weiss 2019a, they are more likely to face a shortage of highly qualified teachers.</p>\n<p>In our next reports, we will discuss the factors that make it hard for schools&mdash;and especially for high poverty schools&mdash;to attract and retain teachers, and, relatedly, why teachers want to leave the profession and why people are less inclined to pursue a teaching career in the first place. In brief, we will show that the supply of new teachers is not meeting the demand at least in part because teacher pay and working conditions and the prestige of teaching are deteriorating. We argue that policymakers are failing to meet the needs of their constituents by failing to address the factors that are prompting teachers to quit and dissuading people from entering the profession, by underestimating what this job involves and by not supporting efforts to professionalize teaching.</p>\n<h2>About the authors</h2>\n<p><strong>Emma Garc&iacute;a</strong> is an education economist at the Economic Policy Institute, where she specializes in the economics of education and education policy.

The surveys collect data on and from teachers, principals, and schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.<a data-note_number=\"20\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">20</a> All three surveys were conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the U.S. Department of Education. The survey results are housed in the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which is part of the Department of Education&rsquo;s Institute of Education Sciences (IES).</p>\n<p>The NTPS is the redesigned SASS, with a focus on &ldquo;flexibility, timeliness, and integration with other Department of Education data&rdquo; (NCES 2019). Both the NTPS and SASS include very detailed questionnaires at the teacher level, school level, and principal level, and the SASS also includes very detailed questionnaires at the school district level (NCES 2017). The TFS survey, which is the source of data on teachers who stay or quit, was conducted a year after the 2011&ndash;2012 SASS survey to collect information on the employment and teaching status, plans, and opinions of teachers in the SASS. Following the first administration of the NTPS, no follow-up study was done, preventing us from conducting an updated analysis of teachers by teaching status the year after the NTPS. NCES plans to conduct a TFS again in the 2020&ndash;2021 school year, following the 2019&ndash;2020 NTPS.</p>\n<p>The 2015&ndash;2016 NTPS includes public and charter schools only, while the SASS and TFS include all schools (public, private, and charter schools).<a data-note_number=\"21\" href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">21</a> We restrict our analyses to public schools and teachers in public noncharter schools.</p>\n<h3>Digest of Education Statistics 2018</h3>\n<p>The <em>Digest of Education Statistics</em> 2018 (NCES 2018) provides &ldquo;a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American education from prekindergarten through graduate school.&rdquo; We use information included in &ldquo;Chapter 3 Postsecondary Education.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the tables consulted, the information is available from 1970 to 2016&ndash;2017, which we reproduce in the appendix. In the body of the report, we focus on academic years 2008&ndash;2009 and 2015&ndash;2016 (the first year serves as a pre-recession marker and allows us to match it with the eldest information available in the Title II data (see below); 2015&ndash;2016 allows us to match it with the most recent NTPS data). Values for other years, including the SASS&rsquo;s 2011&ndash;2012 data, the TFS&rsquo;s 2012&ndash;2013 data, and several rates of change, are also shown in the appendix.

Supply-side drivers are linked to the number of qualified people who are available and willing to teach, i.e., the number of people interested in and training to be teachers and the attachment existing teachers feel to the profession.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">3. </a> Sorensen and Ladd note that class sizes did not generally increase as a result of high teacher turnover in North Carolina, likely because of state policies that preclude increasing class size to accommodate teacher vacancies. On average, across math and English language arts (ELA) classes in middle school, 20.9 percent of teachers have three or fewer years of experience, 12.0 percent have lateral or provisional licenses, and 29.5 percent are teaching out of their subject of certification. Licensure exam scores of middle school math and ELA teachers are, on average, 0.13 standard deviations below the mean of all teachers. For a comparison with national-level shares, see Garc&iacute;a and Weiss 2019a.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">4. </a> This finding contrasts with prior suggestions by Hanushek and others that, because teachers who leave tend to be less able and skilled, their exit will improve the quality of a schools&rsquo; teaching pool (Hanushek and Rivkin 2007). This perspective reduces pressure to adopt policies that encourage the retention of teachers, overlooking the trade-off between the qualifications and quality of teachers who leave and those who come (Sorensen and Ladd 2018).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">5. </a> Notwithstanding this evidence of the short-term decrease in people awarded teaching degrees or completing teacher preparation programs, Cowan et al. (2016) note that &ldquo;teacher production has grown steadily since the mid-1980s.&rdquo; They add that this increase &ldquo;has more than kept up with increases in student enrollment in public schools.&rdquo; The long-term view provides a broader context but in a way hides short-term issues that more closely affect today&rsquo;s teacher labor markets. Indeed, the short-term trend is one in which the number of pupils increased, so unless there is an intention to scale back staffing, any decline of the teacher pool is problematic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">6. </a> Traditional teacher preparation programs are typically undergraduate programs offered by institutions of higher education (IHEs) and entered into by individuals who enter college with the goal of becoming a teacher (U.S. Department of Education 2016). (Programs at IHEs leading to a master&rsquo;s of the arts degree in education are also often considered traditional programs.) Alternative programs are almost exclusively post-baccalaureate programs that require a bachelor&rsquo;s degree for admission to the program, offered by IHEs, private or nonprofit organizations, state or local education agencies, or partnerships of entities. (For main differences between traditional and alternative teacher preparation programs, see U.S. Department of Education 2015 and U.S. Department of Education 2016.) The requirements for alternative routes to a teaching certificate vary significantly across states.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">7. </a> Teachers from alternative routes have been found to be more effective in some studies (Xu, Hannaway, and Taylor 2011), as effective as teachers from traditional programs in other research (Whitford, Zhang, and Katsiyannis 2017, Clark et al. 2017; Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger 2008), and less effective than their peers (Darling-Hammond et al. 2005). After assessing the pros and cons of both types of programs, Fraser and Lefty (2018) acknowledge that &ldquo;advocates for alternative approaches claim that education schools are hopelessly stuck and unlikely to reform, and that alternative routes represent the optimal way to prepare new teachers for twenty-first-century classrooms&rdquo; but conclude that &ldquo;the university is the proper home for teacher preparation and that the rise of alternative routes is a mostly negative development.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">8. </a> Moreover, in our analysis of the National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS) 2015&ndash;2016 data (to be published in a forthcoming paper in this series), we find that, on average, teachers who enter teaching from alternative programs feel less prepared to do their jobs in the classroom (Garc&iacute;a and Weiss 2019b).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">9. </a> Vacancies and hires may happen for any of a number of reasons, including a school&rsquo;s need to replace teachers who left the school or quit teaching, to increase the number of teachers in order to offer additional subjects or reduce the student-to-teacher ratio, to adapt to increases in student enrollment, etc. These factors, which differ across schools, may point to greater difficulties hiring in some schools, but our data do not allow us to explore vacancies that arise due to curriculum changes and other factors mentioned in this note.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">10. </a> A school may end up filling in a vacancy in a temporary manner, or may make some adjustment to cover the vacancy, for example by expanding a class size or finding an underprepared teacher.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">11. </a> See Ingersoll (2014) for a comparison of attrition among teachers and their peers in most occupations (discussed later in this report). See Goldring, Taie, and Riddles (2014) for the evolution of rates of stayers, movers, and leavers among public school teachers between 1988&ndash;1989 and 2012&ndash;2013 (Table 1 in their report). See Darling-Hammond et al. (2017) for some notes on the attrition and turnover rates in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Some of the comparisons yield only modest gaps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">12. </a> These shares are based on data that follows individuals over time, whereas the information in Table 4 is based on the characteristics of the 2011&ndash;2012 teaching cohort. They offer complementary information to each other.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">13. </a> Using the SASS data and classifying schools by eligibility of Title I funds, Sutcher et al. (2016) find that attrition of full-time teachers was approximately 55 percent higher in high-poverty schools (schools eligible for Title I funds) than in low-poverty schools (schools ineligible for Title I). Using data from North Carolina, Sorensen and Ladd (2018) find that &ldquo;an urban school with high levels of student poverty faces an average turnover rate of over 34 percent versus just above 20 percent in low-poverty rural schools&rdquo; (p. 13). Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) provides financial assistance to local educational agencies (LEAs) and public schools with high numbers or percentages of poor children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic content and student academic achievement standards.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">14. </a> See summary in Garc&iacute;a and Weiss (2019a). A caveat is that the credentials by teaching status are not independent from the reasons why teachers stay, quit, or leave. For example, teachers who are close to retirement are likely to have more experience, be fully certified, etc.).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">15. </a> The share of teachers who are certified by the NBPTS is larger among teachers who leave the profession than among teachers who stay (18.3 percent versus 16.6; this may be driven by teachers who are retiring).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">16. </a> Early career teachers are more likely to quit than middle-career teachers (Allensworth, Ponisciak, and Mazzeo 2009; Guarino, Santib&aacute;&ntilde;ez, and Daley, 2006; Ingersoll 2001). Podolsky et al. 2016 estimate that attrition rates after five years in teaching are &ldquo;at least&rdquo; 19 percent using longitudinal data and explain that the rate with national cross-sectional data was about 30 percent (Podolsky et al. 2016; Darling-Hammond and Sykes 2003).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">17. </a> As we noted in our previous study, &ldquo;in both types of schools, the credentials of teachers who stay in the school are better than those of teachers who quit teaching altogether. But the differences are narrower for teachers in high-poverty schools (with the exception of the share of teachers who majored in their subject of main assignment).&rdquo; (Garc&iacute;a and Weiss 2019a)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">18. </a> The share of certified teachers who quit is larger (a gap of 0.4 percentage points), and the share of NBPTS certified teachers is larger (by 6.1 percentage points). The share of teachers who entered the profession following alternative certification programs is smaller (by 11.1 percentage points), and a substantially smaller share has an educational background in the subject of main assignment (by 9.5 percentage points).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">19. </a> The shortage could occur even if demand were decreasing or staying constant, if supply decreased more drastically, or if supply stayed constant (or increased insufficiently). A shortage can be explained starting from a change in demand, or starting from a change in supply, as it is a gap, or difference, or imbalance between two curves.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">20. </a> The 2015&ndash;2016 NTPS does not produce state-representative estimates. The forthcoming 2017&ndash;2018 NTPS will support state-level estimates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">21. </a> The forthcoming 2017&ndash;2018 NTPS additionally includes the private sector.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-schools-struggle-to-hire-and-retain-teachers-the-second-report-in-the-perfect-storm-in-the-teacher-labor-market-series/\">22. </a> Information for completers is available for school years before 2008&ndash;2009, but not for the breakdown by type of institution shown in the tables.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Allensworth, Ellen, Stephen Ponisciak, and Christopher Mazzeo. 2009. <em><a href=\"https://consortium.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/publications/CCSR_Teacher_Mobility.pdf\">The Schools Teachers Leave: Teacher Mobility in Chicago Public Schools</a></em>.

                "text": "This report is the second in a series examining the magnitude of the teacher shortage and the working conditions and other factors that contribute to the shortage.\nWhat this series finds: The teacher shortage is real, large and growing, and worse than we thought. When indicators of teacher quality (certification, relevant training, experience, etc.) are taken into account, the shortage is even more acute than currently estimated, with high-poverty schools suffering the most from the shortage of credentialed teachers.\nWhat this report finds: This report describes the challenges schools face in staffing themselves, both as a consequence of the teacher shortage and further contributing to it. It shows that a high share of public school teachers are leaving their posts: 13.8 percent are either leaving their school or leaving teaching altogether, according to most recent data. It also shows that schools are having a harder time filling the vacancies that turnover, attrition, and other factors (like increasing student enrollment or broadened curriculums) create. The share of schools that were trying to fill a vacancy but couldn\u2019t tripled from the 2011\u20132012 to 2015\u20132016 school years (increasing from 3.1 to 9.4 percent), and in the same period the share of schools that found it very difficult to fill a vacancy nearly doubled (from 19.7 to 36.2 percent). These difficulties are also shaped by a dwindling pool of applicants to fill vacancies. From the 2008\u20132009 to 2015\u20132016 school years, there was a 15.4 percent drop in the number of education degrees awarded and a 27.4 percent drop in the number of people who completed a teacher preparation program. Schools are also having a harder time retaining credentialed teachers: that can be seen in the small but growing share of all teachers who are newly hired and in their first year of teaching (4.7 percent) and in the substantial shares of teachers who quit who are certified and experienced. All these challenges are more acute for high-poverty schools.\nWhy it matters: A shortage of teachers harms students, teachers, and the public education system as a whole. Lack of sufficient, qualified teachers and the staff instability that accompanies turnover threaten students\u2019 ability to learn and reduce teachers\u2019 effectiveness, and high teacher turnover consumes economic resources that could be better deployed elsewhere. The teacher shortage makes it more difficult to build a solid reputation for teaching and to professionalize it, which further contributes to perpetuating the shortage. In addition, the fact that the shortage is distributed so unevenly among students of different socioeconomic backgrounds challenges the U.S. education system\u2019s goal of providing a sound education equitably to all children.\nWhat we can do about it: Tackle the working conditions and other factors that are prompting teachers to quit and dissuading people from entering the profession, thus making it harder for school districts to retain and attract highly qualified teachers: low pay, a challenging school environment, and weak professional development support and recognition. In addition to tackling these factors for all schools, we must provide extra supports and funding to high-poverty schools, where teacher shortages are even more of a problem.\nUpdate, October 2019: EPI analyses in this report are produced with 2011\u20132012 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) data), 2012\u20132013 Teacher Follow-Up Survey (TFS) data, and 2015\u20132016 National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS) school-level data, and are unaffected by the National Center for Education Statistics\u2019 reexamination of weights developed for the teacher data in the 2015\u20132016 NTPS used in other reports in this series.\nIntroduction\nThe teacher shortage in the nation\u2019s K\u201312 schools is an increasingly recognized but still poorly understood crisis: The shortage is recognized by the media and policymakers, and researchers have estimated the size of the shortage\u2014about 110,000 teachers in the 2017\u20132018 school year, up from no shortage before 2013 (Sutcher, Darling-Hammond, and Carver-Thomas 2016).1 But the shortage is poorly understood because the reasons for it are complex and interdependent. The shortage occurs because there is an insufficient number of credentialed teachers to fill vacancies at schools. Unfilled vacancies happen for any number of reason, including reduced attractiveness of teaching as a profession, increases in school enrollment, reductions in class sizes, and excessive number of teachers leaving their schools. The teacher shortage constitutes a crisis because of its negative effects on students, teachers, and the education system at large. This crisis calls for urgent, comprehensive, and sustainable policy solutions.\nThe first report in this series, The Teacher Shortage Is Real, Large and Growing, and Worse Than We Thought (Garc\u00eda and Weiss 2019a), established that current national estimates of the teacher shortage likely understate the magnitude of the problem: When issues such as teacher qualifications and the unequal distribution of highly credentialed teachers across high- and low-poverty schools are taken into consideration, the teacher shortage problem is much more severe than previously recognized. Building on that research, and using the same quality and equity angles, this paper examines challenges schools are facing in trying to recruit, hire, and retain sufficient, qualified teachers, with a particular focus on high-poverty schools, where those struggles are heightened.\nThis report shows that schools\u2019 staffing efforts are challenged by teachers leaving the profession at high rates and by the reduced pipeline of new teachers as fewer people have entered teaching preparedness pathways in recent years. We also present data suggesting that teachers entering the profession don\u2019t have the same qualifications their peers in years past had, due to the proliferation of nontraditional teacher preparation programs and changes in the requirements for obtaining an initial teaching certificate. We also show staffing trends are affecting the qualifications held by the teaching workforce overall: A lot of teachers quit teaching and some of the teachers who quit are as credentialed or more credentialed than the teachers who stay, and the share of all teachers who are inexperienced has increased over time.\nThese challenges and changes in the aggregate qualification of the teaching labor force manifest in schools in many ways. Schools are reporting difficulties in staffing their schools and are leaving vacancies unfilled despite actively trying to hire for them. Over time the share of teachers who are newly hired has increased as has the share of teachers who are newly hired and in their first year of teaching. High-poverty schools are hit hardest: They find it harder to fill vacancies than low-poverty schools and schools overall, and they experience higher turnover and attrition than low-poverty schools. These findings suggest that efforts to address teacher shortages must consider how schools are affected by both teacher attrition and turnover and by the shrinking pipeline of new potential teachers and the factors that have eroded the appeal of\u2014and regard for\u2014teaching as a profession for both incoming and acting teachers.\nHow do struggles to recruit and hire drive the teacher shortage, and why is the shortage a concern?\nFor schools, the teacher shortage manifests in their inability to staff themselves with teachers who have qualifications appropriate to their specific needs. The number of new teachers a school needs and the qualifications those teachers must have depend on the subject matter and courses the school needs to offer, the size and characteristics of the student body, the state or district requirements that broadened the curriculum or reduced class sizes, the vacancies generated by teachers who left the school or the profession, and other \u201csupply and demand\u201d drivers.2\nNet of some of the external or institutional factors just mentioned, the staffing problem arises when vacancies occur against a backdrop of high rates of teacher attrition (teachers quitting teaching altogether) and turnover (teachers leaving their position to another position or school) and a shrinking pool of new teachers with the needed qualifications due to a waning interest in a teaching career. Indeed, high attrition and a dwindling pool of applicants are the two most troubling dynamics of the education labor market and are largely driving the teacher shortage and hence are largely responsible for the costs and consequences of the teacher shortage (Ingersoll 2004, 2014; Sutcher, Darling-Hammond, and Carver-Thomas 2016; Darling-Hammond et al. 2017).\nAs we saw in the first report, the shortage imposes real costs on teachers themselves, on students, on schools, and on the education system at large. In addition to the economic cost of replacing teachers who are leaving (Carroll 2007; Carver-Thomas and Darling-Hammond 2017; LPI 2017), there are performance costs when highly qualified teachers leave schools. High absolute and net teacher turnover\u2014i.e., overall and when comparing the shares of teachers who leave a school with the share who arrive\u2014harms both the morale of those teachers who stay, and the cohesion of the school as a whole, which makes sense given the central role teachers play in one another\u2019s decisions regarding curriculum, instruction, student assessment, and school governance and policy (Sorensen and Ladd 2018; Kraft and Papay 2014). Net turnover increases a school\u2019s share of inexperienced teachers who are not fully certified or credentialed to teach the subject to which they are assigned, and turnover begets further turnover, substantially weakening the overall quality and ability of the school\u2019s teacher pool (Sorensen and Ladd 2018).3 Turnover also depresses student achievement (Ronfeltd, Loeb, and Wyckoff 2013; Darling-Hammond 1999; Ladd and Sorensen 2016), especially in our highest-poverty schools, with \u201cturnover-induced loss of general and grade-specific experience\u201d as the main driver of declining student achievement (see Sorensen and Ladd 2018, 2, citing Hanushek, Rivkin, and Shiman 2016).4\nIn this report, we examine the challenges schools face accessing a sufficient pool of qualified applicants, filling vacancies that arise, and retaining credentialed teachers. We also identify disparities in recruitment and attrition between high- and low-poverty schools, which should be expected, given the substantial disparities between working conditions in high-poverty schools and in low-poverty schools (as examined in the forthcoming reports in this series).\nChallenges to recruiting and hiring credentialed teachers\nHow easy or hard it is for schools to recruit and hire strong teachers to fill open positions depends in part on the size and qualifications of the pool of potential new teachers. That is why changes to the pool of potential new teachers, to how well teachers in the pool were prepared, to what requirements they had to meet to access a teaching credential, and to the total number of teachers who need to be recruited all affect the ease or difficulty of filling openings in a school.\nThe pipeline of potential teachers is shrinking\nThe diminishing pool of applicants and changes in the characteristics of those applicants over time help to explain some of the challenges to recruitment. Schools will struggle to staff their ranks with well-prepared teachers if fewer individuals are attracted into teaching or if their training and preparation have weakened.\nWhile requirements vary state to state, generally someone must earn a bachelor\u2019s degree from an accredited institution and complete a teacher preparation program (or \u201cteacher certification program,\u201d as referred to in our last report) to be eligible to obtain a certificate to teach. (Teacher preparation programs prepare candidates to meet certification requirements but do not award certificates\u2014only the state can do that. Candidates may complete a program but fail to pass the required certification tests or may fail to meet some other requirements to earn the certification.) All teachers need a bachelor\u2019s degree, but not all teachers need a bachelor\u2019s degree in education. However, a bachelor\u2019s degree in education is a common route into teaching because the teacher preparation program is completed as part of the education major. Persons who wish to be teachers but who did not major in education as an undergraduate may pursue a master\u2019s degree in education or may enroll in an alternative teacher preparation program. Teachers also pursue master\u2019s degrees and doctorates to advance their education. For these reasons, we can glean insights into the popularity of teaching and the strength of the teacher pipeline by looking at the number of people pursing education degrees and enrolling in teacher preparation programs (see footnote 6 and table notes for descriptions of the types of teacher preparation programs).\nBoth the appeal of education as a discipline and the pool of potential new teachers shrank significantly between the 2008\u20132009 and 2015\u20132016 school years, as suggested by Figure A, which shows a dramatic drop in both the number of people awarded degrees in education and the number of people enrolling in and completing teacher preparation programs. From 2008\u20132009 to 2015\u20132016, the number of enrollees in teacher preparation programs fell 37.8 percent, and the number of people who completed teacher preparation programs fell 27.4 percent.5\nTable 1 further unpacks these sharp reductions and provides context. For example it shows that not only did the number of people awarded education degrees fall, the share of education degrees awarded as a percentage of all degrees awarded fell, with the exception of Ph.D.s. (Ph.D.s increased in both total number of degrees and as a share of degrees awarded but constitute a very small percentage of education degrees awarded.) Of all the bachelor\u2019s degrees awarded in 2015\u20132016, 4.5 percent were in the field of education; of all the master\u2019s degrees awarded, 18.6 percent were in education. These shares were 1.8 and 8.4 percentage points smaller than in 2008\u20132009, before the teacher shortage crisis developed. (During the 2008\u20132009 school year school systems were just starting to grapple with the economic recession, which led to big cuts in school spending that in some cases have yet to be fully restored, as noted in Leachman, Masterson and Figueroa 2017 and Leachman and Figueroa 2019). To put it another way, in percent terms, bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in education awarded as a share of all degrees fell by roughly a third (28.5 percent and 31.2 percent, respectively) from 2008\u20132009 to 2015\u20132016.\nThe table also shows negative but much more intense trends for enrollees in specific types of teacher preparation programs. Although, as shown above, overall enrollees decreased by 37.8 percent from 2008\u20132009 to 2015\u20132016, enrollees in traditional programs fell by 44.6 percent, and enrollees in alternative programs offered by institutions of higher education (IHEs) fell by 40.1 percent. When we look at the number of people who completed teacher preparation programs by program type, the changes by program type are closer. Overall, the number of completers decreased by 27.4 percent. Completers of alternative programs at institutions of higher education decreased the most (down by 29.6 percent), followed by completers of traditional programs (down by 27.8 percent), and by completers of alternative programs (down by 22.9 percent).6\nThe aggregate numbers alone point to a reduction in the size of the pool of teachers. But the qualifications of that pool are also affected by the type and quality of the training of the applicants, which in turn can affect the effectiveness of novice teachers in the classrooms. As shown in the table, the increase of potential teachers who are enrolled in or who have completed alternative training programs is notable. Our first report in this series (Garc\u00eda and Weiss 2019a) found a marked increase in the share of current teachers who had followed alternative routes into teaching between 2011\u20132012 and 2015\u20132016 (i.e., who went into teaching after completing an alternative teacher preparation program). Although the research on the quality of preparation programs is inconclusive, there are concerns associated with the proliferation of nontraditional programs (Fraser and Lefty 2018).7 Some of these concerns relate to the relative instability of nontraditional-entry teachers as members of the teaching workforce as alternative routes into teaching are associated with higher turnover (Redding and Smith 2016). 8\nOther factors that influence the qualifications of the teacher workforce include changes in the standards for becoming a teacher such as licensure examinations and the requirements of preparation programs. Our exploration of Title II data from the U.S. Department of Education (2017c and 2017d) identifies certain trends that could negatively affect teacher qualifications (although more detailed qualitative work would be needed to assess the reasons for, and net impact of, the changes, which is beyond of the scope of this report).\nNevertheless, we found that the number of states requiring content-specific bachelor\u2019s degrees for initial teaching credentials decreased. (If a state requires a content-specific bachelor\u2019s degree, that generally means that if a teacher is to teach a specific subject, such as math, the teacher must have majored in that subject.) Of states with data in 2008\u20132009 and 2015\u20132016, fewer states required a content-specific bachelor\u2019s for elementary, middle-level, and secondary level certificates in 2015\u20132016. Examining the requirements across all initial certificates available, we also noted a large decrease in the share initial teaching certificates requiring a content-specific bachelor\u2019s degree for middle school, which fell from 38.6 percent to 22.8 percent of all initial certificates, a 15.8 percentage-points decrease. Over the same period there were also drops in the share of initial certificates requiring performance assessments (down 16.2 percentage points), supervised clinical experience (down 10.8 percentage points), or a police record examination (down 17.2 percentage points) in order to earn a teaching certificate. However, there was an increase in the share of initial certificates requiring \u201cprescribed coursework\u201d (up 10.8 percentage points) in order to get a teaching certificate.\nHiring teachers is difficult, especially in high-poverty schools\nSchools\u2019 hiring patterns help explain the teacher shortage because they reflect the actual school-level need for teachers, the share of schools that are hiring (irrespective of the reasons), and challenges filling vacancies.9 Shortages arise when finding proper, qualified candidates is difficult or when some vacancies remain unfilled, and shortages grow if these circumstances become more challenging over time.10\nAs shown in Table 2, a large majority of schools report having vacancies to fill, so most are hiring at a given time (about eight in 10 schools report having vacancies for the 2015\u20132016 school year). And nearly one in 10 (9.4 percent) of those schools that were trying to hire said they were unable to fill a vacancy in at least one field (math, English, etc.) in the 2015\u20132016 school year. Finally, over a third (36.2 percent) of schools trying to fill vacancies report finding it very difficult to fill a vacancy in at least one field.\nThe data also show that while high-poverty schools were less likely to be hiring than their low-poverty counterparts (i.e., fewer of them reported having teaching vacancies for which teachers were recruited and interviewed), high-poverty schools with vacancies found it more difficult to hire teachers. Well over a third (36.8 percent) of high-poverty schools with vacancies reported that it was \u201cvery difficult\u201d to fill at least one of their vacancies versus 34.3 percent of low-poverty schools.\nThere are also differences between high- and low-poverty schools in the share that are unable to fill vacancies. While these differences are small in absolute terms, they are relatively large. For example, the share of high-poverty schools that had vacancies and report being unable to fill teaching positions in at least one field is 10.5 percent, but this share is greater than the 7.2 percent share in low-poverty schools.\nOne consequence of this greater challenge in high-poverty schools is their higher share of brand new teachers and teachers who are new hires. Here our analysis coincides with what Sorensen and Ladd found in their 2018 study. The share of all teachers who were newly hired teachers (new to the school completing the survey) was 11.2 percent, on average, in the 2015\u20132016 school year (Table 3). But that share was two percentage points higher in high-poverty schools (12.1 percent versus 10.1 percent in low-poverty schools). And, when we look at the share of all teachers who are not only newly hired teachers but in their first year of teaching, we see again that the share is higher in high-poverty schools (5.3 percent versus 3.7 percent). Finally, in high-poverty schools, the share of newly hired teachers who are in their first year of teaching is much higher than in low-poverty schools (39.8 percent versus just 33.8 percent). Although the differences are small in relative terms, these three measures together point to an added source of disadvantage for low-income children and the schools that serve them.\nChallenges to hiring teachers have increased over time\nNot only is hiring a challenge, but the data show that it has become substantially harder in the past few years. First, the share of schools reporting any vacancy increased by more than 11 percentage points between the 2011\u20132012 and 2015\u20132016 school years (from 67.2 percent to 78.8 percent, top panel Figure B). Even more troubling, the share of schools that were trying to hire but reported an unfilled vacancy in at least one position tripled during this period (from 3.1 percent to 9.4 percent). And the share of hiring schools reporting that they had found it \u201cvery difficult\u201d to fill at least one vacancy also increased\u2014almost doubling (from 19.7 percent to 36.2 percent). Relatedly, the share of all teachers who were newly hired teachers increased between the 2011\u20132012 and 2015\u20132016 school years (from 7.2 percent to 11.2 percent), as did the share of all teachers who were newly hired and in their first year of teaching (from 4.0 percent to 4.7 percent), indicating that the teaching workforce became less experienced over this period.\nRetaining credentialed teachers is difficult\nExcessive attrition is another troubling dynamic plaguing teacher labor markets and a major driver of shortages (Ingersoll 2004, 2014; Sutcher, Darling-Hammond, and Carver-Thomas 2016; Darling-Hammond et al. 2017). Attrition and turnover\u2014leaving the profession altogether or switching schools\u2014are high in teaching in both absolute and relative terms. Turnover and attrition have been increasing over time (Goldring, Taie, and Riddles 2014) and are higher for U.S. teachers than among teachers in other countries (Darling-Hammond et al. 2017).11 Teachers see much higher attrition than their peers in most occupations: About 30 percent of college graduates who became teachers were not in the profession five years later, compared with 14 percent of pharmacists, 16 percent of engineers, and 19 percent of nurses and lawyers (Ingersoll 2014).12 Among the other professions Ingersoll described in his study, the only ones with higher attrition rates are secretaries, child care workers, paralegals, and correctional officers. It is worth noting that these other professions, with the exception of correctional officers, are very heavily female and relatively low paying, unlikely a coincidental association and one that affirms the findings in our later reports in this series about teachers\u2019 insufficient pay, weak supports, and even lack of societal respect.\nTeacher turnover and attrition rates are high, causing staff instability and increasing pressure to hire\nAfter the 2011\u20132012 school year, 6.5 percent of teachers left the school but remained in the profession (the measure of turnover), and 7.3 percent left the teaching profession (the measure of attrition), for a total of 13.8 percent of teachers lost to turnover or attrition generating the potential need for a replacement (Figure C). As in other aspects of teacher shortages, however, rates vary between low- and high-poverty schools. In low-poverty schools, 88.1 percent of teachers who were teaching when the 2011\u20132012 Schools and Staffing Survey was administered were at the same school the following year, compared with 84.6 percent in high-poverty schools. To put it another way, the aggregate turnover and attrition rate is 15.3 in high-poverty schools\u2014that\u2019s 3.4 percentage points higher than the aggregate turnover and attrition rate in low-poverty schools (11.9 percent), creating more potential vacancies in high-poverty schools than in better-off schools.13\nTeacher turnover and attrition rates affect the overall qualifications of the teaching labor force\nMore data are needed to determine whether attrition causes certain schools to lose teachers with qualifications associated with effective teaching. As suggested by the literature and noted in our first paper in this series, overall, the credentials of teachers who stay in teaching are stronger than the credentials of teachers who quit the profession, which would indicate no leakage in teaching overall through attrition. 14\nTable 4 provides a detailed look at the shares of teachers with various qualifications (certification, experience, and educational background, as in our first report) by teacher status, i.e., whether the teacher stays in the school, leaves the school but stays in the profession, or leaves teaching altogether. The table also provides shares of teachers with an additional qualification\u2014certification by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) in at least one content area. (The NBPTS is a nongovernmental organization that administers National Board certification, a voluntary national assessment program that certifies teachers who demonstrate advanced knowledge, skills, and practice in their certificate area.)\nAs the table shows, the qualifications of teachers who stay, leave the school, or quit the profession differ, but schools are not consistently losing strong credentials due to attrition, because the qualifications of teachers staying at the school are the strongest (with the exception of teachers who are NBTPS).15 On average, 92.1 percent of teachers who stay at the same school have a regular, state, or advanced professional certificate (i.e., are fully certified); 86.1 percent took a traditional route into teaching, 80.9 percent are experienced, and 69.5 percent have an educational background in the subject of main assignment. Among teachers who left the school or quit teaching, smaller shares are fully certified (88.1 percent and 90.3 percent, respectively), have taken a traditional route into teaching (82.5 percent and 82.9 percent), are experienced (66.1 percent and 77.2 percent), and have an educational background in the subject of main assignment (66.9 percent and 63.1 percent, respectively).16\nEarlier in this report we showed that turnover and attrition are higher in high-poverty schools (see discussion around Figure C). Here we discuss how turnover and attrition could be responsible for some leakage of credentials from high-poverty schools. One reason is the weaker link between higher credentials and retention in high-poverty schools. As we showed in our last paper in this series (see Garc\u00eda and Weiss 2019a, particularly Table 2), while higher credentials deter attrition (in our analysis, shown descriptively, not causally), this link between quality and retention was weaker in high-poverty schools.17 Also, because, just as teachers who stay in high-poverty schools are less qualified than teachers who stay in low-poverty schools (Garc\u00eda and Weiss 2019a, Figure D), teachers in high-poverty schools who end up quitting the profession are more qualified with respect to certification than teachers who in low-poverty schools who quit the profession. See Appendix Table 3, which replicates Table 2 from Garcia and Weiss 2019a; Appendix Figure A, which replicates Figure D in Garcia and Weiss 2019a; and Appendix Figure B, which provides data on teachers in high- and low-poverty schools who quit.18\nIt\u2019s hard to determine exactly how the exit of credentialed teachers affects the qualifications of the teacher labor force overall and in high- and low-poverty schools because the qualifications of the overall teacher pool also depend on the qualifications of the teachers coming into the workforce and into these schools. But as Ladd and Sorensen (2018) find, \u201call schools experiencing periods of high turnover are more likely to hire not-fully-licensed teachers,\u201d and \u201cschools serving large proportions of low-income student are much more likely to do so. Since schools serving high-poverty student populations already experience above average turnover rates, these differential impacts are particularly worrying\u201d (p. 20). In short, high-poverty schools would need to compensate for these negative trends by hiring greater shares of credentialed teachers to keep up with their wealthier counterparts, and we know that doing so would be extremely unlikely.\nConclusion\nIn practice, the teacher shortage manifests in schools as an inability to be staffed adequately. A school may need to hire more teachers for any one or more of the following reasons: school enrollment increases, teachers leave, the curriculum expands and teachers are needed in new fields, a policy reduces class size, the school\u2019s budget increases, etc. And for any reason or combination of reasons\u2014insufficient teachers coming into teaching, excessive numbers of teachers quitting the profession because of worsening working conditions, etc.\u2014those needed teachers are increasingly difficult for a school to find.19 This imbalance creates a shortage.\nThis report focuses on the challenges schools face filling their vacancies (or meeting their staffing needs) primarily due to two trends: more teachers leaving schools and the profession and fewer people entering the teaching profession. It also raises three concerns on top of the leakage of teachers from the profession and the dwindling pool or potential new teachers. First is the potential change or decline in the qualifications of the teaching workforce, driven by increased churn (turnover and attrition) in the teacher labor market, by changes in the strength of the teaching preparation programs, by alterations in the requirements to accessing an initial teaching credential, and by the slight loss of credentialed teachers who leave the profession. Second is the increased difficulty that schools are having filling vacancies, which in turn has increased the pressure on schools to hire teachers with fewer credentials and thus affected the overall qualifications of the teaching workforce. Third is the fact the high-poverty schools are in an especially difficult position: they are more likely to have vacancies and have a hard time filling vacancies, they are more likely to fill positions with newly hired teachers (and newly hired teachers in their first year of teaching), their teachers are more likely to leave the school or leave the profession, and, as shown in Garc\u00eda and Weiss 2019a, they are more likely to face a shortage of highly qualified teachers.\nIn our next reports, we will discuss the factors that make it hard for schools\u2014and especially for high poverty schools\u2014to attract and retain teachers, and, relatedly, why teachers want to leave the profession and why people are less inclined to pursue a teaching career in the first place. In brief, we will show that the supply of new teachers is not meeting the demand at least in part because teacher pay and working conditions and the prestige of teaching are deteriorating. We argue that policymakers are failing to meet the needs of their constituents by failing to address the factors that are prompting teachers to quit and dissuading people from entering the profession, by underestimating what this job involves and by not supporting efforts to professionalize teaching.\nAbout the authors\nEmma Garc\u00eda is an education economist at the Economic Policy Institute, where she specializes in the economics of education and education policy.

The surveys collect data on and from teachers, principals, and schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.20 All three surveys were conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the U.S. Department of Education. The survey results are housed in the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which is part of the Department of Education\u2019s Institute of Education Sciences (IES).\nThe NTPS is the redesigned SASS, with a focus on \u201cflexibility, timeliness, and integration with other Department of Education data\u201d (NCES 2019). Both the NTPS and SASS include very detailed questionnaires at the teacher level, school level, and principal level, and the SASS also includes very detailed questionnaires at the school district level (NCES 2017). The TFS survey, which is the source of data on teachers who stay or quit, was conducted a year after the 2011\u20132012 SASS survey to collect information on the employment and teaching status, plans, and opinions of teachers in the SASS. Following the first administration of the NTPS, no follow-up study was done, preventing us from conducting an updated analysis of teachers by teaching status the year after the NTPS. NCES plans to conduct a TFS again in the 2020\u20132021 school year, following the 2019\u20132020 NTPS.\nThe 2015\u20132016 NTPS includes public and charter schools only, while the SASS and TFS include all schools (public, private, and charter schools).21 We restrict our analyses to public schools and teachers in public noncharter schools.\nDigest of Education Statistics 2018\nThe Digest of Education Statistics 2018 (NCES 2018) provides \u201ca compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American education from prekindergarten through graduate school.\u201d We use information included in \u201cChapter 3 Postsecondary Education.\u201d\nIn the tables consulted, the information is available from 1970 to 2016\u20132017, which we reproduce in the appendix. In the body of the report, we focus on academic years 2008\u20132009 and 2015\u20132016 (the first year serves as a pre-recession marker and allows us to match it with the eldest information available in the Title II data (see below); 2015\u20132016 allows us to match it with the most recent NTPS data). Values for other years, including the SASS\u2019s 2011\u20132012 data, the TFS\u2019s 2012\u20132013 data, and several rates of change, are also shown in the appendix. The tables consulted are:\nTable 322.10.

We use the spreadsheets for enrollees and completers22 of teacher preparation programs, for requirements for an initial teaching credential, and for states requiring content-specific bachelor\u2019s degrees for all initial teaching credentials.\nThe \u201cData Tools\u201d tab can be found here ( https://title2.ed.gov/Public/DataTools/Tables.aspx) and is cited as U.S. Department of Education 2017e in the references section.

For a more detailed review of the media coverage of the shortage, see Garc\u00eda and Weiss 2019a.\n2. Teacher demand-side drivers are linked to the need for teachers, i.e., how many teachers are needed for a given number of students with a given set of needs, or with the size of school budgets. Supply-side drivers are linked to the number of qualified people who are available and willing to teach, i.e., the number of people interested in and training to be teachers and the attachment existing teachers feel to the profession.\n3. Sorensen and Ladd note that class sizes did not generally increase as a result of high teacher turnover in North Carolina, likely because of state policies that preclude increasing class size to accommodate teacher vacancies. On average, across math and English language arts (ELA) classes in middle school, 20.9 percent of teachers have three or fewer years of experience, 12.0 percent have lateral or provisional licenses, and 29.5 percent are teaching out of their subject of certification. Licensure exam scores of middle school math and ELA teachers are, on average, 0.13 standard deviations below the mean of all teachers. For a comparison with national-level shares, see Garc\u00eda and Weiss 2019a.\n4. This finding contrasts with prior suggestions by Hanushek and others that, because teachers who leave tend to be less able and skilled, their exit will improve the quality of a schools\u2019 teaching pool (Hanushek and Rivkin 2007). This perspective reduces pressure to adopt policies that encourage the retention of teachers, overlooking the trade-off between the qualifications and quality of teachers who leave and those who come (Sorensen and Ladd 2018).\n5. Notwithstanding this evidence of the short-term decrease in people awarded teaching degrees or completing teacher preparation programs, Cowan et al. (2016) note that \u201cteacher production has grown steadily since the mid-1980s.\u201d They add that this increase \u201chas more than kept up with increases in student enrollment in public schools.\u201d The long-term view provides a broader context but in a way hides short-term issues that more closely affect today\u2019s teacher labor markets. Indeed, the short-term trend is one in which the number of pupils increased, so unless there is an intention to scale back staffing, any decline of the teacher pool is problematic.\n6. Traditional teacher preparation programs are typically undergraduate programs offered by institutions of higher education (IHEs) and entered into by individuals who enter college with the goal of becoming a teacher (U.S. Department of Education 2016). (Programs at IHEs leading to a master\u2019s of the arts degree in education are also often considered traditional programs.) Alternative programs are almost exclusively post-baccalaureate programs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree for admission to the program, offered by IHEs, private or nonprofit organizations, state or local education agencies, or partnerships of entities. (For main differences between traditional and alternative teacher preparation programs, see U.S. Department of Education 2015 and U.S. Department of Education 2016.) The requirements for alternative routes to a teaching certificate vary significantly across states.\n7. Teachers from alternative routes have been found to be more effective in some studies (Xu, Hannaway, and Taylor 2011), as effective as teachers from traditional programs in other research (Whitford, Zhang, and Katsiyannis 2017, Clark et al. 2017; Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger 2008), and less effective than their peers (Darling-Hammond et al. 2005). After assessing the pros and cons of both types of programs, Fraser and Lefty (2018) acknowledge that \u201cadvocates for alternative approaches claim that education schools are hopelessly stuck and unlikely to reform, and that alternative routes represent the optimal way to prepare new teachers for twenty-first-century classrooms\u201d but conclude that \u201cthe university is the proper home for teacher preparation and that the rise of alternative routes is a mostly negative development.\n8. Moreover, in our analysis of the National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS) 2015\u20132016 data (to be published in a forthcoming paper in this series), we find that, on average, teachers who enter teaching from alternative programs feel less prepared to do their jobs in the classroom (Garc\u00eda and Weiss 2019b).\n9. Vacancies and hires may happen for any of a number of reasons, including a school\u2019s need to replace teachers who left the school or quit teaching, to increase the number of teachers in order to offer additional subjects or reduce the student-to-teacher ratio, to adapt to increases in student enrollment, etc. These factors, which differ across schools, may point to greater difficulties hiring in some schools, but our data do not allow us to explore vacancies that arise due to curriculum changes and other factors mentioned in this note.\n10. A school may end up filling in a vacancy in a temporary manner, or may make some adjustment to cover the vacancy, for example by expanding a class size or finding an underprepared teacher.\n11. See Ingersoll (2014) for a comparison of attrition among teachers and their peers in most occupations (discussed later in this report). See Goldring, Taie, and Riddles (2014) for the evolution of rates of stayers, movers, and leavers among public school teachers between 1988\u20131989 and 2012\u20132013 (Table 1 in their report). See Darling-Hammond et al. (2017) for some notes on the attrition and turnover rates in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Some of the comparisons yield only modest gaps.\n12. These shares are based on data that follows individuals over time, whereas the information in Table 4 is based on the characteristics of the 2011\u20132012 teaching cohort. They offer complementary information to each other.\n13. Using the SASS data and classifying schools by eligibility of Title I funds, Sutcher et al. (2016) find that attrition of full-time teachers was approximately 55 percent higher in high-poverty schools (schools eligible for Title I funds) than in low-poverty schools (schools ineligible for Title I). Using data from North Carolina, Sorensen and Ladd (2018) find that \u201can urban school with high levels of student poverty faces an average turnover rate of over 34 percent versus just above 20 percent in low-poverty rural schools\u201d (p. 13). Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) provides financial assistance to local educational agencies (LEAs) and public schools with high numbers or percentages of poor children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic content and student academic achievement standards.\n14. See summary in Garc\u00eda and Weiss (2019a). A caveat is that the credentials by teaching status are not independent from the reasons why teachers stay, quit, or leave. For example, teachers who are close to retirement are likely to have more experience, be fully certified, etc.).\n15. The share of teachers who are certified by the NBPTS is larger among teachers who leave the profession than among teachers who stay (18.3 percent versus 16.6; this may be driven by teachers who are retiring).\n16. Early career teachers are more likely to quit than middle-career teachers (Allensworth, Ponisciak, and Mazzeo 2009; Guarino, Santib\u00e1\u00f1ez, and Daley, 2006; Ingersoll 2001). Podolsky et al. 2016 estimate that attrition rates after five years in teaching are \u201cat least\u201d 19 percent using longitudinal data and explain that the rate with national cross-sectional data was about 30 percent (Podolsky et al. 2016; Darling-Hammond and Sykes 2003).\n17. As we noted in our previous study, \u201cin both types of schools, the credentials of teachers who stay in the school are better than those of teachers who quit teaching altogether. But the differences are narrower for teachers in high-poverty schools (with the exception of the share of teachers who majored in their subject of main assignment).\u201d (Garc\u00eda and Weiss 2019a)\n18. The share of certified teachers who quit is larger (a gap of 0.4 percentage points), and the share of NBPTS certified teachers is larger (by 6.1 percentage points). The share of teachers who entered the profession following alternative certification programs is smaller (by 11.1 percentage points), and a substantially smaller share has an educational background in the subject of main assignment (by 9.5 percentage points).\n19. The shortage could occur even if demand were decreasing or staying constant, if supply decreased more drastically, or if supply stayed constant (or increased insufficiently). A shortage can be explained starting from a change in demand, or starting from a change in supply, as it is a gap, or difference, or imbalance between two curves.\n20. The 2015\u20132016 NTPS does not produce state-representative estimates. The forthcoming 2017\u20132018 NTPS will support state-level estimates.\n21. The forthcoming 2017\u20132018 NTPS additionally includes the private sector.\n22. Information for completers is available for school years before 2008\u20132009, but not for the breakdown by type of institution shown in the tables.\nReferences\nAllensworth, Ellen, Stephen Ponisciak, and Christopher Mazzeo. 2009.
