And a few states looking at moving up their contests to March 3 could add to the total.</p>\n<p>Super Tuesday&rsquo;s states vary widely in geography, racial diversity and economic outlook, from mega-state California to tiny Vermont, largely white Massachusetts to states like Texas and North Carolina, where African-American and Hispanic voters are pillars of the Democratic electorate.</p>\n<p>Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R), who has the sole authority to schedule his state&rsquo;s primary, is likely to add the Peach State to the fray.</p>\n<p>New York legislators are eyeing the same date, while Oregon state lawmakers this week introduced legislation to move their contest to March 3 as well.</p>\n<p>The cluster of contests will force campaigns to pivot quickly from retail politics in the living rooms of Iowa and New Hampshire to fly-ins and larger rallies in a broad range of states across three time zones &mdash; making momentum all the more critical.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Even a well-resourced presidential campaign has a hard time communicating at the level you need to in all these Super Tuesday states,&rdquo; said Jed Ober, a top delegate counter in Clinton&rsquo;s 2016 operation who now serves as chief of staff to Rep. <a data-nid=\"420293\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/susan-wild\">Susan Wild</a> (D-Pa.).</p>\n<p>Democratic strategists aligned with several campaigns, and those who have run complicated delegate-gathering operations in previous years, say this will add to the importance of overperforming in the first four primaries and caucuses.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With the field as crowded as it is, you&rsquo;ve really got to pull off a win or a better-than-expected showing in those first four states to justify moving forward. It&rsquo;s Iowa or bust for a lot of these candidates,&rdquo; said Josh Putnam, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington who tracks party rules on the FrontloadingHQ blog.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When calendars are frontloaded like this one looks like it&rsquo;s going to be, it&rsquo;s tended to amplify results in the earlier states,&rdquo; Putnam said.</p>\n<p>Seventeen states and three territories have not yet formally settled on a date for their presidential nominating contests, according to Putnam&rsquo;s count. Those states must win the Democratic National Committee&rsquo;s (DNC) approval for their plans by May 3, though they may apply for a 30-day extension.</p>\n<p>New DNC rules require those plans to be posted online for 30 days for public comment. The Democratic rules also require states that hold caucuses to make accommodations for those who cannot attend on a specific date and time, such as early voting or absentee voting.</p>\n<p>Some of the new rules will make the caucus process more transparent. The rules will require a state to allocate delegates based on the initial vote of those who show up, rather than through a multilayered process that continues long beyond caucus day to county- and state-level conventions; in 2008, Obama won more delegates in Iowa than the initial caucus results suggested because his supporters showed up to the later conventions in greater proportion than those who backed Clinton or then-Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.).</p>\n<p>The effect of the rules changes, and the aftermath of the 2016 contest between Clinton and Sen. <a data-nid=\"188217\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) in which huge turnouts overwhelmed party officials, has meant some states are already moving away from caucuses in favor of primaries.</p>\n<p>Democrats in Minnesota, Maine, Colorado, Nebraska and Idaho have opted to allocate delegates in primaries rather than caucuses. Utah legislators have voted to fund a presidential primary, though the state Democratic Party has not yet formally embraced it.</p>\n<p>One difference between previous election cycles and this year&rsquo;s calendar is a seeming acceptance of the first four contests.</p>\n<p>In previous cycles, states like Michigan and Florida held contests out of compliance with Democratic Party rules. This year, no state seems poised to try to jump ahead of or challenge Iowa and New Hampshire&rsquo;s place on the calendar.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve kind of squeezed out these calendar disruptions,&rdquo; one senior Democratic strategist said. &ldquo;All of the states basically accept the positions of the four early states.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The complex calendar has forced campaigns to focus on the grinding but necessary work of organizing in every state and territory. First they must gain access to the ballot, rules for which are set by state law rather than by the parties. Then they must recruit potential delegates and shepherd those people through the election process.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The early focus is making sure you&rsquo;re on all the ballots,&rdquo; Berman said. With so many candidates in need of signatures to qualify for those ballots, &ldquo;even the local volunteer activist base will be stretched.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The number of Democratic candidates running this year, after relatively small fields ran in 2008 and 2012, means there are few party operatives with experience in the delegate allocation process.</p>\n<p>Sen. <a data-nid=\"347914\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> (D-Calif.) has recruited David Huynh, who ran delegate operations for Clinton&rsquo;s campaign in 2016. Sanders maintains a stable of knowledgeable veterans from his own 2016 run, including former campaign manager Jeff Weaver, now a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign.</p>\n<p>Other campaigns may be forced to learn complex rules on the fly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of them won&rsquo;t have access to senior people who have done it before,&rdquo; the Democratic strategist said.</p>",

                "text": "A glut of Super Tuesday contests in 2020 is adding to the importance of the Democratic presidential primary\u2019s first four contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, underscoring the need for a strong early showing ahead of what will become a nationalized campaign.\nStates eager to influence the outcome of the Democratic primary race are stacking next March 3 with a huge pool of delegates that will be at stake from coast to coast.\nWithout a big win or a surprisingly strong showing in one of those early states, candidates are likely to find their media attention and fundraising ability evaporating \u2014 particularly given the crowded field of high-profile politicians.\nMany of the names battling for attention today are unlikely to even survive to March 3.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many candidates will make it to Super Tuesday,\u201d said Jeff Berman, who has run delegate operations for several Democratic presidential campaigns, including Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s always a sequential process.\u201d\nAt least 10 states will hold nominating contests on Super Tuesday 2020, in addition to a territory and Democrats living abroad.\nAs it stands, at least 41 percent of all Democratic delegates will have been allocated after votes are counted on Super Tuesday. And a few states looking at moving up their contests to March 3 could add to the total.\nSuper Tuesday\u2019s states vary widely in geography, racial diversity and economic outlook, from mega-state California to tiny Vermont, largely white Massachusetts to states like Texas and North Carolina, where African-American and Hispanic voters are pillars of the Democratic electorate.\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R), who has the sole authority to schedule his state\u2019s primary, is likely to add the Peach State to the fray.\nNew York legislators are eyeing the same date, while Oregon state lawmakers this week introduced legislation to move their contest to March 3 as well.\nThe cluster of contests will force campaigns to pivot quickly from retail politics in the living rooms of Iowa and New Hampshire to fly-ins and larger rallies in a broad range of states across three time zones \u2014 making momentum all the more critical.\n\u201cEven a well-resourced presidential campaign has a hard time communicating at the level you need to in all these Super Tuesday states,\u201d said Jed Ober, a top delegate counter in Clinton\u2019s 2016 operation who now serves as chief of staff to Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.).\nDemocratic strategists aligned with several campaigns, and those who have run complicated delegate-gathering operations in previous years, say this will add to the importance of overperforming in the first four primaries and caucuses.\n\u201cWith the field as crowded as it is, you\u2019ve really got to pull off a win or a better-than-expected showing in those first four states to justify moving forward. It\u2019s Iowa or bust for a lot of these candidates,\u201d said Josh Putnam, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington who tracks party rules on the FrontloadingHQ blog.\n\u201cWhen calendars are frontloaded like this one looks like it\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s tended to amplify results in the earlier states,\u201d Putnam said.\nSeventeen states and three territories have not yet formally settled on a date for their presidential nominating contests, according to Putnam\u2019s count. Those states must win the Democratic National Committee\u2019s (DNC) approval for their plans by May 3, though they may apply for a 30-day extension.\nNew DNC rules require those plans to be posted online for 30 days for public comment. The Democratic rules also require states that hold caucuses to make accommodations for those who cannot attend on a specific date and time, such as early voting or absentee voting.\nSome of the new rules will make the caucus process more transparent. The rules will require a state to allocate delegates based on the initial vote of those who show up, rather than through a multilayered process that continues long beyond caucus day to county- and state-level conventions; in 2008, Obama won more delegates in Iowa than the initial caucus results suggested because his supporters showed up to the later conventions in greater proportion than those who backed Clinton or then-Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.).\nThe effect of the rules changes, and the aftermath of the 2016 contest between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in which huge turnouts overwhelmed party officials, has meant some states are already moving away from caucuses in favor of primaries.\nDemocrats in Minnesota, Maine, Colorado, Nebraska and Idaho have opted to allocate delegates in primaries rather than caucuses. Utah legislators have voted to fund a presidential primary, though the state Democratic Party has not yet formally embraced it.\nOne difference between previous election cycles and this year\u2019s calendar is a seeming acceptance of the first four contests.\nIn previous cycles, states like Michigan and Florida held contests out of compliance with Democratic Party rules. This year, no state seems poised to try to jump ahead of or challenge Iowa and New Hampshire\u2019s place on the calendar.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of squeezed out these calendar disruptions,\u201d one senior Democratic strategist said. \u201cAll of the states basically accept the positions of the four early states.\u201d\nThe complex calendar has forced campaigns to focus on the grinding but necessary work of organizing in every state and territory. First they must gain access to the ballot, rules for which are set by state law rather than by the parties. Then they must recruit potential delegates and shepherd those people through the election process.\n\u201cThe early focus is making sure you\u2019re on all the ballots,\u201d Berman said. With so many candidates in need of signatures to qualify for those ballots, \u201ceven the local volunteer activist base will be stretched.\u201d\nThe number of Democratic candidates running this year, after relatively small fields ran in 2008 and 2012, means there are few party operatives with experience in the delegate allocation process.\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has recruited David Huynh, who ran delegate operations for Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016. Sanders maintains a stable of knowledgeable veterans from his own 2016 run, including former campaign manager Jeff Weaver, now a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign.\nOther campaigns may be forced to learn complex rules on the fly.\n\u201cA lot of them won\u2019t have access to senior people who have done it before,\u201d the Democratic strategist said.",

That was because he won 304 electoral votes to Clinton's 227. It was only the fifth time in U.S. history that a presidential candidate won the White House but lost the popular vote.</p>\n<p>The defeat spurred Democrats &mdash; who were still fuming from a similar loss in the 2000 election to former President George W. Bush &mdash; to renew their effort to bypass the Electoral College.</p>\n<p>Democratic-leaning states across the country, including New York, Illinois and most of the New England states, have begun signing on to a pact that would see them awarding their electoral votes to whomever wins the popular vote.</p>\n<p>Colorado Gov. <a data-nid=\"188001\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/jared-polis\">Jared Polis</a> (D) announced earlier this month that his state also would join the pact.

It\u2019s like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon. The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win. With the Popular Vote, you go to....\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2019\n....just the large States - the Cities would end up running the Country. Smaller States & the entire Midwest would end up losing all power - & we can\u2019t let that happen. I used to like the idea of the Popular Vote, but now realize the Electoral College is far better for the U.S.A.\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2019\nTrump won the 2016 presidential election over his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton despite the fact that Clinton won the popular vote. That was because he won 304 electoral votes to Clinton's 227. It was only the fifth time in U.S. history that a presidential candidate won the White House but lost the popular vote.\nThe defeat spurred Democrats \u2014 who were still fuming from a similar loss in the 2000 election to former President George W. Bush \u2014 to renew their effort to bypass the Electoral College.\nDemocratic-leaning states across the country, including New York, Illinois and most of the New England states, have begun signing on to a pact that would see them awarding their electoral votes to whomever wins the popular vote.\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) announced earlier this month that his state also would join the pact. Legislators in 16 other states have introduced similar bills this session, according to National Popular Vote.\nBut the coalition of blue states is still well short of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.\nCritics of the Electoral College say the system incentivizes candidates to focus on only a handful of critical swing states in order to win the necessary electoral votes. And they say it discourages voters in reliably red or blue states from heading to the polls.\nNonetheless, Clinton was heavily criticized for failing to campaign in states such as Wisconsin and Michigan during the 2016 election, leading to a renewed focus on the Midwest as key to the Democrats' effort to take back the White House.\nThe Democratic National Committee announced last week that it would be holding its 2020 convention in Milwaukee, underscoring the party's urgency to rectify perceived mistakes from the previous presidential election.",

Jay Inslee (D), who has made climate change the focal point of his presidential campaign, called on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to hold a debate centered solely on the issue.\n\u201cClimate change is the biggest threat facing our nation. And it demands to be the sole focus of a nationally televised debate. Democrats must put this issue front and center,\u201d he said in a petition to pressure the DNC to hold the debate.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be a one-off question where candidates get to give a soundbite and move on: Climate change is at the heart of every issue that matters to voters, and voters deserve to hear what 2020 presidential candidates plan to do about it,\u201d he added in a press release.\nInslee\u2019s petition follows a similar one from Youth Climate Strike that had neared its goal of 30,000 signatures as of Tuesday night.\nInslee is hoping to double down on climate change as a means to differentiate himself in a Democratic primary crowd that is already fielding over a dozen candidates, many of whom have higher name recognition and beefier campaign bank accounts.\nThe DNC has not released details about its debates beyond the schedule, declining thus far to make commitments about topics or structure.\n\u201cWhile Republicans refuse to even acknowledge that climate change is real, Democrats are eager to put forward their solutions to combat climate change, and we will absolutely have these discussions during the 2020 primary process,\u201d the DNC said in a statement to The Hill when asked about Inslee\u2019s petition.\n\u201cThe DNC is currently ironing out the details for all 12 debates and will work with the networks to ensure that Democrats have a platform to discuss these issues directly with the American people,\u201d Hinojosa added.\nThe DNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill.",

His wife was never charged.\"\nThe president in December brought up Cohen\u2019s wife in tweets accusing Cohen of lying to get a better sentence.\n\u201cYou mean he can do all of the TERRIBLE, unrelated to Trump, things having to do with fraud, big loans, Taxis, etc., and not serve a long prison term?

She\u2019s about to learn a lot...\n\u2014 Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) February 26, 2019\nCohen on Tuesday spoke privately with the Senate Intelligence Committee ahead of his public testimony on Wednesday.\nThe president\u2019s former attorney and \"fixer\" will reportedly testify that President Trump has a history of making racist comments and inflating or delating his net worth for business purposes such as avoiding taxes.\nHis testimony comes before he is set to serve three years in prison after he pleaded guilty to campaign finance law violations, bank fraud, tax fraud and lying to Congress about the timing of negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow.\nGaetz insisted that he was not engaging in witness intimidation, telling the Daily Beast that he was \"challenging the veracity and character of a witness.\u201d\n\u201cThis is what it looks like to compete in the marketplace of ideas,\u201d the Florida Republican said.\nGaetz did not say whether or not he had evidence for his claims about Cohen.\nHe told the outlet that him questioning Cohen\u2019s marriage was a fair topic ahead of his time in prison.\n\u201cIf you think I have the power to determined when people leave their spouses you attribute far too much credit to me,\u201d he told the reporter. \u201cI just merely pondered the question, Sam.\u201d\nThe Hill has reached out to Gaetz's office for further comment.",

They did not want a king,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>The wall had been a principal element of Trump&rsquo;s 2016 campaign, and, as president, he&rsquo;s offered increasingly dire warnings that new physical barriers are vital in the law enforcement battle against illegal crossings, violent crime and drug trafficking in the border region.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Without strong Borders, we don&rsquo;t have a Country,&rdquo; Trump tweeted leading up to the vote.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a public safety argument that Democrats have rejected outright, noting that border apprehensions have fallen significantly relative to levels of decades past.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is no basis in law or in fact to declare a national emergency,&rdquo; Rep. <a data-nid=\"187890\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/hakeem-jeffries\">Hakeem Jeffries</a> (N.Y.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said hours before the vote. &ldquo;President Donald Trump has more stories than &lsquo;Harry Potter,&rsquo; and all of them are make-believe.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump had declared the emergency on Feb. 15, just a day after Congress approved &mdash; and the president reluctantly agreed to sign &mdash; a sweeping spending bill to avert another government shutdown.</p>\n<p>The package included some funding for border security measures but denied Trump&rsquo;s initial demand for $5.7 billion in new wall construction. The emergency declaration was his way to sidestep a recalcitrant Congress to advance a key policy priority.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s Republican allies on Capitol Hill were quick to rush to his defense, accusing Democrats of threatening national security by opposing new wall funding in the spending package &mdash; and leaving the president no choice but to act on his own.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What we see happening along the border, the amount of drugs, the amount of deaths in America, the human trafficking that&rsquo;s coming across, the overwhelming problem there,&rdquo; said House Minority Leader <a data-nid=\"186556\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/kevin-mccarthy\">Kevin McCarthy</a> (R-Calif.), rejecting the Democrats&rsquo; constitutional argument.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So, the president has the authority to do it. And we will uphold him,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Appearing alongside McCarthy and other GOP leaders was Rep. <a data-nid=\"186565\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/adam-kinzinger\">Adam Kinzinger</a> (Ill.), an active-duty member of the Air National Guard, who was recently deployed to the border and supports Trump&rsquo;s emergency declaration.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I went down there neutral on this question, didn&rsquo;t know whether or not I&rsquo;d support a national emergency,&rdquo; Kinzinger said. &ldquo;And I came back more convinced probably than anybody that this is the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Democrats responded with accusations of their own, framing the emergency declaration as a desperate &mdash; and illegal &mdash; gambit by a frustrated president to get his way.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;People will say, &lsquo;Well, there have been a lot of emergency designations.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said House Majority Leader <a data-nid=\"188062\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/steny-hoyer\">Steny Hoyer</a> (D-Md.). &ldquo;This is the only one &mdash; the only one &mdash; that has been used to get around a Congress&rsquo;s refusal to appropriate money for a particular objective.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Republican defectors on Tuesday were a mix of several groups: There were the conservative constitutional literalists, like Reps. <a data-nid=\"186395\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/justin-amash\">Justin Amash</a> (Mich.) and <a data-nid=\"186527\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/thomas-massie\">Thomas Massie</a> (Ky.), who frequently clash with GOP leaders on separation-of-power issues; there were the moderate centrists &mdash; including Reps. <a data-nid=\"361867\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/elise-stefanik\">Elise Stefanik</a> (N.Y.), <a data-nid=\"187983\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/greg-walden\">Greg Walden</a> (Ore.) and <a data-nid=\"186596\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/cathy-rodgers\">Cathy McMorris Rodgers</a> (Wash.) &mdash; who agreed with the Democrats&rsquo; legal argument that Trump is abusing his powers. And there was Rep. <a data-nid=\"358058\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/william-hurd\">Will Hurd</a> (Texas), the only Republican representing a border district who has long-opposed Trump&rsquo;s push for a lengthy and imposing border wall.</p>\n<p>Another major group of GOP critics &mdash; the military hawks who were initially furious with Trump&rsquo;s plan to shift billions of dollars from the Defense Department to build his wall &mdash; ultimately sided with the White House.</p>\n<p>Under the National Emergencies Act, the Senate must vote on the resolution within 18 days. Because the law deems it &ldquo;privileged,&rdquo; opponents cannot filibuster the measure, meaning the Democratic supporters in the Senate need only four Republican votes to send the bill to Trump&rsquo;s desk.</p>\n<p>Passage in the upper chamber is not guaranteed but appears increasingly likely. Three GOP senators &mdash; <a data-nid=\"188229\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/susan-collins\">Susan Collins</a> (Maine), <a data-nid=\"188289\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/lisa-murkowski\">Lisa Murkowski</a> (Alaska) and <a data-nid=\"280695\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/sen-thom-tillis\">Thom Tillis</a> (N.C.) &mdash; are already on record in support of the disapproval resolution, and a handful of others are leaning that way.</p>\n<p>The president, for his part, has vowed in no uncertain terms to veto the resolution if it travels that far. Neither chamber is expected to have enough support to win a two-thirds vote to override the promised veto.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not going to be able to reverse this emergency declaration. But it does show that they&rsquo;re in denial that there&rsquo;s a crisis at the border,&rdquo; House Minority Whip <a data-nid=\"188036\" href=\"https://thehill.com/people/steve-scalise\">Steve Scalise</a> (R-La.) told The Hill ahead of the vote.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Pelosi goes to the border and waves a Mexican flag saying there&rsquo;s no crisis the same week that an illegal alien goes to Napa, right in her own backyard, and attacks a cop,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s happening every day. There&rsquo;s a real crisis and the president is taking steps to keep our country safe.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Democrats are also vowing a legal challenge to Trump&rsquo;s declaration, either by filing a suit of their own or piling on litigation already emerging from states and outside groups.</p>\n<p>For the time being, they&rsquo;re awaiting the outcome of the legislative battle before playing their legal hand.</p>\n<p>Hoyer said Tuesday that, even if Trump&rsquo;s veto is sustained, it will mark a political victory for Democrats.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If he vetoes it, it will be another statement of his authoritarian inclinations,&rdquo; Hoyer said. &ldquo;So, I think we will have gained something.&rdquo;</p>",

Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), an active-duty member of the Air National Guard, who was recently deployed to the border and supports Trump\u2019s emergency declaration.\n\u201cI went down there neutral on this question, didn\u2019t know whether or not I\u2019d support a national emergency,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cAnd I came back more convinced probably than anybody that this is the right thing to do.\u201d\nDemocrats responded with accusations of their own, framing the emergency declaration as a desperate \u2014 and illegal \u2014 gambit by a frustrated president to get his way.\n\u201cPeople will say, \u2018Well, there have been a lot of emergency designations.\u2019 That\u2019s right,\u201d said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). \u201cThis is the only one \u2014 the only one \u2014 that has been used to get around a Congress\u2019s refusal to appropriate money for a particular objective.\u201d\nThe Republican defectors on Tuesday were a mix of several groups: There were the conservative constitutional literalists, like Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.) and Thomas Massie (Ky.), who frequently clash with GOP leaders on separation-of-power issues; there were the moderate centrists \u2014 including Reps. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), Greg Walden (Ore.) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.) \u2014 who agreed with the Democrats\u2019 legal argument that Trump is abusing his powers. And there was Rep. Will Hurd (Texas), the only Republican representing a border district who has long-opposed Trump\u2019s push for a lengthy and imposing border wall.\nAnother major group of GOP critics \u2014 the military hawks who were initially furious with Trump\u2019s plan to shift billions of dollars from the Defense Department to build his wall \u2014 ultimately sided with the White House.\nUnder the National Emergencies Act, the Senate must vote on the resolution within 18 days. Because the law deems it \u201cprivileged,\u201d opponents cannot filibuster the measure, meaning the Democratic supporters in the Senate need only four Republican votes to send the bill to Trump\u2019s desk.\nPassage in the upper chamber is not guaranteed but appears increasingly likely. Three GOP senators \u2014 Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Thom Tillis (N.C.) \u2014 are already on record in support of the disapproval resolution, and a handful of others are leaning that way.\nThe president, for his part, has vowed in no uncertain terms to veto the resolution if it travels that far. Neither chamber is expected to have enough support to win a two-thirds vote to override the promised veto.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to reverse this emergency declaration. But it does show that they\u2019re in denial that there\u2019s a crisis at the border,\u201d House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) told The Hill ahead of the vote.\n\u201cPelosi goes to the border and waves a Mexican flag saying there\u2019s no crisis the same week that an illegal alien goes to Napa, right in her own backyard, and attacks a cop,\u201d he continued. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s happening every day. There\u2019s a real crisis and the president is taking steps to keep our country safe.\u201d\nDemocrats are also vowing a legal challenge to Trump\u2019s declaration, either by filing a suit of their own or piling on litigation already emerging from states and outside groups.\nFor the time being, they\u2019re awaiting the outcome of the legislative battle before playing their legal hand.\nHoyer said Tuesday that, even if Trump\u2019s veto is sustained, it will mark a political victory for Democrats.\n\u201cIf he vetoes it, it will be another statement of his authoritarian inclinations,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cSo, I think we will have gained something.\u201d",

He's also repeatedly lashed out at McCain for voting against the GOP health care bill in 2017.\nBut Trump has doubled down on his frustration with McCain this week despite pushback from lawmakers and McCain's family.\n\u201cI was never a fan of John McCain, and I never will be,\u201d Trump told reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\nTrump relitigated the ObamaCare repeal-and-replace vote at the White House, saying he was \"unhappy\" with McCain's surprise \"no\" vote, which effectively killed the GOP effort to overhaul the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cHe campaigned on repealing and replacing ObamaCare for years and then he got to a vote and he said \u2018thumbs down,\u2019\u201d Trump added. \u201cI think that's disgraceful, plus there are other things.\u201d\nMcCain was one of the most vocal GOP critics of Trump in the Senate, criticizing his leadership style, breaking with him on foreign policy issues like Russia and urging his colleagues to vote against Gina Haspel's nomination to be CIA director.\nTrump's comments at the White House come after he lashed out at McCain in tweets over the weekend, saying that while \u201cspreading the fake and totally discredited Dossier\u201d is a \u201cdark stain\u201d on McCain\u2019s record, his vote against ObamaCare repeal was \u201cfar worse.\u201d",

The most pervasive forms of local advertising often feel like this&mdash;like nursery rhymes or urban legends, or something implanted in your most tender consciousness by a social version of natural law. When Texans hear the name Jim Adler, their souls reply with &ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q67cD8pDgqk\">Texas Hammer</a>.&rdquo; Michiganders know that God filled the sky around the Detroit airport with clouds and with <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/behind-the-billboard-joumana-kayrouzs-against-all-odds-story/Content?oid=2201433\">billboards for Joumana Kayrouz</a>. New Yorkers know the Cellino &amp; Barnes hotline better than they know their Social Security numbers. And, for many Americans who live in or around the ninety-six cities where the Shen Yun Performing Arts troupe is set to perform this year, the words &ldquo;Shen Yun&rdquo; conjure an indelible yet incomprehensible image: a flat, bright shade of lilac, a woman leaping in the sky with a fan-shaped white skirt and billowing pink sleeves, and the enigmatic phrase &ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"http://artcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/ArtCenter_Listing_Big_MainImage_2500x1300-002.jpg\">5,000 Years of Civilization Reborn</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Shen Yun has lived in the pink fluffy insulation of my mind for a while now. Last year, the ads were goldenrod yellow, like dehydrated urine, and they said &ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.artscalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/www.artscalendar.com/images/2017/10/edp_ShenYun2018_AT19518_100417-5b3322775e11-400x364.jpg\">Reviving 5,000 Years of Civilization</a>.&rdquo; The year before that, the ads (&ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"http://www.shenyun.com/data/image/original/2016/06/26/15d0beeeeaa7f86a5f2c6b493c29776f.jpg\">Experience a Divine Culture</a>&rdquo;) were green. The year before that, the Shen Yun poster featured <em>two</em> women dancing, wearing birthday-cake-frosting colors, and for months I sat in the subway reading but in no way processing the phrase &ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.mccawhall.com/assets/img/2016-Shen-Yun-1.jpg\">Absolutely the No. 1 show in the world</a>.&rdquo; These posters were so uncanny and contentless that the easiest explanation for their existence was that my brain had simply glitched and invented Shen Yun the way John Nash invented his roommate in &ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtctExmj9zI\">A Beautiful Mind</a>.&rdquo; Shen Yun was a <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://psmag.com/social-justice/theres-a-name-for-that-the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon-59670\">Baader-Meinhof object</a>: once I saw it, I started to see it everywhere. Shen Yun greeted me silently at the bus stop and loomed over highway exits, following me around on the physical plane of existence the way anything you shop for on the Internet starts to follow you around online.</p>\n<p>Then, over the holidays, I went home to Houston, where my parents live. On Christmas Day, my dad told me that he had something special planned for the family. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this show,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s supposed to be spectacular. It&rsquo;s called Shen Yun.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; I said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mike and Lilly saw it,&rdquo; my dad said. &ldquo;They said it was beautiful.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <em>real?</em>&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What <em>is</em> it?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; my dad said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dancing. Beautiful . . . dancing. Really fabulous, traditional dancing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Is it like Cirque du <em>Soleil</em>?&rdquo; I asked, furiously Googling Shen Yun on my phone, something that had never occurred to me to do before. (Why look up a figment of your own imagination?) I was seeing a lot of search results that involved the word &ldquo;cult.&rdquo; I clicked on one link, and then closed it, realizing that I did not want to spoil what lay ahead of me&mdash;a free journey into the fantastic unknown.</p>\n<p>On the day of Shen Yun, I developed chills and a fever, which I immediately decided to ignore in the interest of seeing Shen Yun. My family drove to the fancy concert hall downtown, where the lobby was full of people in suits and cocktail dresses. After we took our seats, two hosts with animatronic smiles, speaking both Chinese and English, began introducing a series of dances, which were called things like &ldquo;Goodness in the Face of Evil&rdquo; and &ldquo;The World Divinely Restored.&rdquo; The female dancers moved in hypnotic swirls; the male dancers jumped and flipped. Behind the stage was an enormous screen upon which digital backdrops&mdash;ancient temples, royal gardens, the cosmos&mdash;appeared, along with digital dancers who would walk to the bottom of the screen and then pop out, via the appearance of a living dancer, on the stage. The colors were near-neon and unnatural; they reminded me of the glowing hues of <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymx8z_ydOeU\">Photo Hunt</a>, the tabletop bar game. The hosts started talking about a spiritual discipline called Falun Dafa, and then introduced a dance in which a beautiful young follower of Falun Dafa was kidnapped and imprisoned by Communists, who harvested her organs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hallucinating,&rdquo; I whispered to my brother in the dark.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Would everyone like to learn a little Chinese?&rdquo; one of the hosts asked. He intoned a phrase and asked the audience to repeat it. &ldquo;That phrase means &lsquo;I love Shen Yun,&rsquo; &rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>I felt my forehead. The dances continued, sleeves swirling, skirts rippling. A man came onstage to sing a song in Chinese, which was translated on the screen behind him. &ldquo;We follow Dafa, the Great Way,&rdquo; he began, singing about a Creator who saved mankind and made the world anew. &ldquo;Atheism and evolution are deadly ideas. Modern trends destroy what makes us human,&rdquo; he sang. At the end of the song, the row of older white people sitting behind me clapped fervently. In the final dance number, a group of Falun Dafa followers, who wore blue and yellow and clutched books of religious teachings, battled for space in a public square with corrupt youth. (Their corruption was evident because they were wearing black, looking at their cell phones, and, in the case of two men, holding hands.) Chairman Mao appeared, and the sky turned black; the city in the digital backdrop was obliterated by an earthquake, then finished off by a Communist tsunami. A red hammer and sickle glowed in the center of the wave. Dazed, I rubbed my eyes and saw a huge, bearded face disappearing in the water.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Was that . . . ?&rdquo; I said to my brother, wondering if I needed to go to the hospital.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Karl Marx?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yeah, I think that was a tsunami with the face of Karl Marx.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>Shen yun</em>, according to Shen Yun, means &ldquo;the beauty of divine beings dancing.&rdquo; (It can also be translated as &ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=49kmDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=%22shen+yun%22+translate&source=bl&ots=X_pQCQk0O_&sig=ACfU3U2o3rO6AyHK0dgOzxnSXXoSY_TxMA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjRm-7K1f3gAhVGOq0KHeqIC5M4ChDoATAEegQIBhAB#v=onepage&q=%22shen%20yun%22&f=false\">the rhythm of a divine spirit</a>,&rdquo; or, more simply, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s melody.&rdquo;) The Shen Yun Performing Arts organization was founded in 2006, in New York&rsquo;s Hudson Valley, and put on its first touring show in 2007. By 2009, there were three touring Shen Yun companies. Today, there are six companies, each consisting of forty or so dancers, all of them trained at the Fei Tian Academy, which is situated on a four-hundred-and-twenty-seven-acre campus established for Falun Dafa practitioners in upstate New York. The dancers are accompanied by an orchestra that incorporates Chinese instruments; each troupe includes <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.ludwig-van.com/toronto/2018/11/24/how-shen-yun-is-becoming-a-tour-de-force/\">about eighty people</a>. In addition to the ninety-six American cities it is touring this year, Shen Yun will visit Vancouver, Berlin, Auckland, Taipei, Daegu, Aix-en-Provence, and dozens of other places.</p>\n<p>Shen Yun is a nonprofit. In 2016, it reported more than seventy-five million dollars in assets and more than twenty-two million dollars in revenue. Given the amount of money the organization seems to spend on advertising, it is hard to believe that it could be in the black, but the <em>Guardian</em> has reported that each city&rsquo;s Shen Yun advertising campaign is <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/12/shen-yun-falun-gong-traditional-chinese-dance-troupe-china-doesnt-want-you-to-see\">sponsored by the local Falun Dafa association</a>. The ad blitzes are carefully co&ouml;rdinated&mdash;&ldquo;Shen Yun Ads&rdquo; is basically <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jonkauffman/status/1071182459104940033?lang=en\">a season on the calendar now</a>. In January, I decided to double-check my woozy memories and buy a ticket to see Shen Yun again, at Lincoln Center. After the purchase went through, I received a survey that asked me which of the thirty-six different versions of the Shen Yun ad that ran in New York&mdash;<em>Newsday</em> spots, Metro North posters, brochures in the mail&mdash;had convinced me to buy tickets. Shen Yun saturation has reached such a <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ineedahitta/status/1087860337666412544\">ludicrous intensity</a> that it has, <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://twitter.com/verbena_lemon/status/1087885376876933121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1087885376876933121&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lamag.com%2Fculturefiles%2Fshen-yun-marketing%2F\">in recent months</a>, <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://twitter.com/emiyannn/status/1091053886801096704\">become a meme</a>.</p>\n<figure><video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5de53e9038d0696a4c999d62/5d7fc3d3-89d9-457e-a699-4a5d89208b31high.mp4?videoIndex=0&requester=oo\"><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video><iframe src=\"https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.365.1_en.html#goog_1282731180\"></iframe><video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5de53e9038d0696a4c999d62/5d7fc3d3-89d9-457e-a699-4a5d89208b31thumbs.mp4\"></video><h4>EMBED URL</h4><h4>VIDEO URL</h4><h4>Our bad!

                "text": "Just as it is impossible for me to articulate with any certainty the moment I entered adulthood or began to believe that human life on Earth would not last past the twenty-second century, I cannot tell you when I first became aware of Shen Yun. The most pervasive forms of local advertising often feel like this\u2014like nursery rhymes or urban legends, or something implanted in your most tender consciousness by a social version of natural law. When Texans hear the name Jim Adler, their souls reply with \u201cTexas Hammer.\u201d Michiganders know that God filled the sky around the Detroit airport with clouds and with billboards for Joumana Kayrouz. New Yorkers know the Cellino & Barnes hotline better than they know their Social Security numbers. And, for many Americans who live in or around the ninety-six cities where the Shen Yun Performing Arts troupe is set to perform this year, the words \u201cShen Yun\u201d conjure an indelible yet incomprehensible image: a flat, bright shade of lilac, a woman leaping in the sky with a fan-shaped white skirt and billowing pink sleeves, and the enigmatic phrase \u201c5,000 Years of Civilization Reborn.\u201d\nShen Yun has lived in the pink fluffy insulation of my mind for a while now. Last year, the ads were goldenrod yellow, like dehydrated urine, and they said \u201cReviving 5,000 Years of Civilization.\u201d The year before that, the ads (\u201cExperience a Divine Culture\u201d) were green. The year before that, the Shen Yun poster featured two women dancing, wearing birthday-cake-frosting colors, and for months I sat in the subway reading but in no way processing the phrase \u201cAbsolutely the No. 1 show in the world.\u201d These posters were so uncanny and contentless that the easiest explanation for their existence was that my brain had simply glitched and invented Shen Yun the way John Nash invented his roommate in \u201cA Beautiful Mind.\u201d Shen Yun was a Baader-Meinhof object: once I saw it, I started to see it everywhere. Shen Yun greeted me silently at the bus stop and loomed over highway exits, following me around on the physical plane of existence the way anything you shop for on the Internet starts to follow you around online.\nThen, over the holidays, I went home to Houston, where my parents live. On Christmas Day, my dad told me that he had something special planned for the family. \u201cIt\u2019s this show,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be spectacular. It\u2019s called Shen Yun.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d I said.\n\u201cMike and Lilly saw it,\u201d my dad said. \u201cThey said it was beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s real?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d my dad said. \u201cIt\u2019s dancing. Beautiful . . . dancing. Really fabulous, traditional dancing.\u201d\n\u201cIs it like Cirque du Soleil?\u201d I asked, furiously Googling Shen Yun on my phone, something that had never occurred to me to do before. (Why look up a figment of your own imagination?) I was seeing a lot of search results that involved the word \u201ccult.\u201d I clicked on one link, and then closed it, realizing that I did not want to spoil what lay ahead of me\u2014a free journey into the fantastic unknown.\nOn the day of Shen Yun, I developed chills and a fever, which I immediately decided to ignore in the interest of seeing Shen Yun. My family drove to the fancy concert hall downtown, where the lobby was full of people in suits and cocktail dresses. After we took our seats, two hosts with animatronic smiles, speaking both Chinese and English, began introducing a series of dances, which were called things like \u201cGoodness in the Face of Evil\u201d and \u201cThe World Divinely Restored.\u201d The female dancers moved in hypnotic swirls; the male dancers jumped and flipped. Behind the stage was an enormous screen upon which digital backdrops\u2014ancient temples, royal gardens, the cosmos\u2014appeared, along with digital dancers who would walk to the bottom of the screen and then pop out, via the appearance of a living dancer, on the stage. The colors were near-neon and unnatural; they reminded me of the glowing hues of Photo Hunt, the tabletop bar game. The hosts started talking about a spiritual discipline called Falun Dafa, and then introduced a dance in which a beautiful young follower of Falun Dafa was kidnapped and imprisoned by Communists, who harvested her organs. \u201cI\u2019m hallucinating,\u201d I whispered to my brother in the dark.\n\u201cWould everyone like to learn a little Chinese?\u201d one of the hosts asked. He intoned a phrase and asked the audience to repeat it. \u201cThat phrase means \u2018I love Shen Yun,\u2019 \u201d he said.\nI felt my forehead. The dances continued, sleeves swirling, skirts rippling. A man came onstage to sing a song in Chinese, which was translated on the screen behind him. \u201cWe follow Dafa, the Great Way,\u201d he began, singing about a Creator who saved mankind and made the world anew. \u201cAtheism and evolution are deadly ideas. Modern trends destroy what makes us human,\u201d he sang. At the end of the song, the row of older white people sitting behind me clapped fervently. In the final dance number, a group of Falun Dafa followers, who wore blue and yellow and clutched books of religious teachings, battled for space in a public square with corrupt youth. (Their corruption was evident because they were wearing black, looking at their cell phones, and, in the case of two men, holding hands.) Chairman Mao appeared, and the sky turned black; the city in the digital backdrop was obliterated by an earthquake, then finished off by a Communist tsunami. A red hammer and sickle glowed in the center of the wave. Dazed, I rubbed my eyes and saw a huge, bearded face disappearing in the water.\n\u201cWas that . . . ?\u201d I said to my brother, wondering if I needed to go to the hospital.\n\u201cKarl Marx?\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, I think that was a tsunami with the face of Karl Marx.\u201d\nShen yun, according to Shen Yun, means \u201cthe beauty of divine beings dancing.\u201d (It can also be translated as \u201cthe rhythm of a divine spirit,\u201d or, more simply, \u201cGod\u2019s melody.\u201d) The Shen Yun Performing Arts organization was founded in 2006, in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, and put on its first touring show in 2007. By 2009, there were three touring Shen Yun companies. Today, there are six companies, each consisting of forty or so dancers, all of them trained at the Fei Tian Academy, which is situated on a four-hundred-and-twenty-seven-acre campus established for Falun Dafa practitioners in upstate New York. The dancers are accompanied by an orchestra that incorporates Chinese instruments; each troupe includes about eighty people. In addition to the ninety-six American cities it is touring this year, Shen Yun will visit Vancouver, Berlin, Auckland, Taipei, Daegu, Aix-en-Provence, and dozens of other places.\nShen Yun is a nonprofit. In 2016, it reported more than seventy-five million dollars in assets and more than twenty-two million dollars in revenue. Given the amount of money the organization seems to spend on advertising, it is hard to believe that it could be in the black, but the Guardian has reported that each city\u2019s Shen Yun advertising campaign is sponsored by the local Falun Dafa association. The ad blitzes are carefully co\u00f6rdinated\u2014\u201cShen Yun Ads\u201d is basically a season on the calendar now. In January, I decided to double-check my woozy memories and buy a ticket to see Shen Yun again, at Lincoln Center. After the purchase went through, I received a survey that asked me which of the thirty-six different versions of the Shen Yun ad that ran in New York\u2014Newsday spots, Metro North posters, brochures in the mail\u2014had convinced me to buy tickets. Shen Yun saturation has reached such a ludicrous intensity that it has, in recent months, become a meme.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH Why Hong Kong\u2019s Protests Exploded Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5de53e9038d0696a4c999d62.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://video.newyorker.com/watch/the-backstory-why-hong-kong-s-protests-exploded/\nOur bad!

                "html": "<p>Late last year, I picked up John Carreyrou&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/152473165X/?tag=thneyo0f-20\">Bad Blood</a>,&rdquo; which chronicles the long con pulled by Elizabeth Holmes, an entrepreneur who dropped out of Stanford at nineteen to found Theranos, a company that she claimed would reinvent the biomedical industry. I was instantly engrossed&mdash;&ldquo;Bad Blood&rdquo; unfolds like a thriller, offering a breathless barrage of details exposing how Holmes deceived her investors and colleagues at nearly every turn. Holmes wanted to disrupt the blood test: she boasted that her company was developing a method for running hundreds of lab tests from a single drop of blood, employing a machine called &ldquo;The Edison&rdquo; that used nanotechnology and robotics to analyze the sample. (It never worked consistently, if at all, but Holmes first hyped, and later faked, the machine&rsquo;s tests.) In just a few short years, thanks to Carreyrou&rsquo;s investigations and leaks from whistle-blowers, Holmes went from Silicon Valley&rsquo;s golden girl&mdash;named the youngest self-made female billionaire by <em>Forbes</em>&mdash;to <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-secrets-of-blood-testing-startup-theranos\">a disgraced fraudster</a> whose company was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Bad Blood&rdquo; does a formidable job charting the Theranos ordeal, but it doesn&rsquo;t get into Holmes&rsquo;s head. After reading the book, I found myself searching for clues to her true character. I Googled pictures of the C.E.O. at the height of her powers (bottle blonde, a smear of red lipstick, the same Steve Jobsian black turtleneck every day), comparing them with her look after she&rsquo;d been found out (pale blue oxfords, bare face, a delicate crucifix necklace). I watched her old <em>TED</em> Talks and lectures and listened to the unnerving sound of her voice, a husky baritone that Carreyrou posits might have been fake. Adam McKay&rsquo;s upcoming Hollywood adaptation of &ldquo;Bad Blood,&rdquo; starring Jennifer Lawrence as Holmes, will no doubt attempt to explain its antiheroine&rsquo;s motives, imposing some neat psychological arc. But, as &ldquo;The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley,&rdquo; a new HBO documentary from Alex Gibney, shows, the real Holmes remains vexingly sphinxlike, no better understood today than when she was in the depths of her deception.</p>\n<p>Gibney, who has made documentaries about such cagey entities as Enron and the Church of Scientology, told me recently that the Theranos scandal was the most difficult story he&rsquo;s reported, owing to the company&rsquo;s atmosphere of intense secrecy and paranoia. It was only after the company fully dissolved, in 2018, that people began to speak with him. Readers of &ldquo;Bad Blood&rdquo; will be familiar with much of the material Gibney assembled for &ldquo;The Inventor,&rdquo; which features Carreyrou as a talking head. But the documentary is worth watching for the range of archival footage Gibney dug up, including some from inside Theranos&rsquo;s clandestine headquarters.</p>\n<p>We see, for instance, clips of Holmes in the ultra-modern, aggressively bright Theranos office, posing next to a large white wall she printed with a Yoda quote, &ldquo;Do or do not, there is no try.&rdquo; We see her give a self-aggrandizing speech to her staff about how she charmed the President of Brazil at a private dinner party, and about how Theranos&rsquo;s enemies are simply jealous of their progress. We see her, in a rare moment of levity, dancing with glee to M. C. Hammer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Touch This&rdquo; after learning that the F.D.A. had approved a minor patent, just months before the fraud revelations broke. One clip shows the making of a promotional Theranos advertisement, for which Holmes hired the documentarian Errol Morris. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fan!&rdquo; Morris tells her, as she steps in front of a ring light for the director&rsquo;s signature closeup shot. The unblinking gaze from her ice-blue eyes, which once telegraphed a monastic intensity, looks, in hindsight, like the mesmerizing stare of a hypnotist. In the most chilling shot in &ldquo;The Inventor,&rdquo; Gibney shows us a slow dissolve between two portraits of Holmes: in one, she looks serious, formidable, a person able to convince Henry Kissinger and Rupert Murdoch that Theranos could change the world. In the other, her mouth stretches into a tight-lipped, inscrutable smile. In the end, the sequence suggests, no matter how long we look at her, we may never get the answers we&rsquo;re really after.</p>",

                "text": "Late last year, I picked up John Carreyrou\u2019s \u201cBad Blood,\u201d which chronicles the long con pulled by Elizabeth Holmes, an entrepreneur who dropped out of Stanford at nineteen to found Theranos, a company that she claimed would reinvent the biomedical industry. I was instantly engrossed\u2014\u201cBad Blood\u201d unfolds like a thriller, offering a breathless barrage of details exposing how Holmes deceived her investors and colleagues at nearly every turn. Holmes wanted to disrupt the blood test: she boasted that her company was developing a method for running hundreds of lab tests from a single drop of blood, employing a machine called \u201cThe Edison\u201d that used nanotechnology and robotics to analyze the sample. (It never worked consistently, if at all, but Holmes first hyped, and later faked, the machine\u2019s tests.) In just a few short years, thanks to Carreyrou\u2019s investigations and leaks from whistle-blowers, Holmes went from Silicon Valley\u2019s golden girl\u2014named the youngest self-made female billionaire by Forbes\u2014to a disgraced fraudster whose company was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\u201cBad Blood\u201d does a formidable job charting the Theranos ordeal, but it doesn\u2019t get into Holmes\u2019s head. After reading the book, I found myself searching for clues to her true character. I Googled pictures of the C.E.O. at the height of her powers (bottle blonde, a smear of red lipstick, the same Steve Jobsian black turtleneck every day), comparing them with her look after she\u2019d been found out (pale blue oxfords, bare face, a delicate crucifix necklace). I watched her old TED Talks and lectures and listened to the unnerving sound of her voice, a husky baritone that Carreyrou posits might have been fake. Adam McKay\u2019s upcoming Hollywood adaptation of \u201cBad Blood,\u201d starring Jennifer Lawrence as Holmes, will no doubt attempt to explain its antiheroine\u2019s motives, imposing some neat psychological arc. But, as \u201cThe Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley,\u201d a new HBO documentary from Alex Gibney, shows, the real Holmes remains vexingly sphinxlike, no better understood today than when she was in the depths of her deception.\nGibney, who has made documentaries about such cagey entities as Enron and the Church of Scientology, told me recently that the Theranos scandal was the most difficult story he\u2019s reported, owing to the company\u2019s atmosphere of intense secrecy and paranoia. It was only after the company fully dissolved, in 2018, that people began to speak with him. Readers of \u201cBad Blood\u201d will be familiar with much of the material Gibney assembled for \u201cThe Inventor,\u201d which features Carreyrou as a talking head. But the documentary is worth watching for the range of archival footage Gibney dug up, including some from inside Theranos\u2019s clandestine headquarters.\nWe see, for instance, clips of Holmes in the ultra-modern, aggressively bright Theranos office, posing next to a large white wall she printed with a Yoda quote, \u201cDo or do not, there is no try.\u201d We see her give a self-aggrandizing speech to her staff about how she charmed the President of Brazil at a private dinner party, and about how Theranos\u2019s enemies are simply jealous of their progress. We see her, in a rare moment of levity, dancing with glee to M. C. Hammer\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Touch This\u201d after learning that the F.D.A. had approved a minor patent, just months before the fraud revelations broke. One clip shows the making of a promotional Theranos advertisement, for which Holmes hired the documentarian Errol Morris. \u201cI\u2019m a fan!\u201d Morris tells her, as she steps in front of a ring light for the director\u2019s signature closeup shot. The unblinking gaze from her ice-blue eyes, which once telegraphed a monastic intensity, looks, in hindsight, like the mesmerizing stare of a hypnotist. In the most chilling shot in \u201cThe Inventor,\u201d Gibney shows us a slow dissolve between two portraits of Holmes: in one, she looks serious, formidable, a person able to convince Henry Kissinger and Rupert Murdoch that Theranos could change the world. In the other, her mouth stretches into a tight-lipped, inscrutable smile. In the end, the sequence suggests, no matter how long we look at her, we may never get the answers we\u2019re really after.",

One of these, which governed the downstairs books, was instituted by my mother, and involved achieving a remarkable harmony&mdash;one that anyone who has ever tried to organize a home library would envy&mdash;among thematic, alphabetic, and aesthetic demands. The other, which governed the upstairs books, was instituted by my father, and was based on the conviction that it is very nice to have everything you&rsquo;ve recently read near at hand, in case you get the urge to consult any of it again; and also that it is a pain in the neck to put those books away, especially when the shelves on which they belong are so exquisitely organized that returning one to its appropriate slot requires not only a card catalogue but a crowbar.</p>\n<p>It was this pair of convictions that led to the development of the Stack. I can&rsquo;t remember it in its early days, because in its early days it wasn&rsquo;t memorable. I suppose back then it was just a modest little pile of stray books, the kind that many readers have lying around in the living room or next to the bed. But by the time I was in my early teens it was the case&mdash;and seemed by then to have always been the case&mdash;that my parents&rsquo; bedroom was home to the Mt. Kilimanjaro of books. Or perhaps more aptly the Mt. St. Helens of books, since it seemed possible that at any moment some subterranean shift in it might cause a cataclysm.</p>\n<p>The Stack had started in a recessed space near my father&rsquo;s half of the bed, bounded on one side by a wall and on the other by my parents&rsquo; dresser, a vertical behemoth taller than I would ever be. At some point in the Stack&rsquo;s development, it had overtopped that piece of furniture, whereupon it met a second tower of books, which, at some slightly later point, had begun growing up along the dresser&rsquo;s other side. For some reason, though, the Stack always looked to me as if it had defied gravity (or perhaps obeyed some other, more mysterious force) and grown <em>down</em> the far side of the dresser instead. At all events, the result was a kind of homemade Arc de Triomphe, extremely haphazard-looking but basically stable, made of some three or four hundred books.</p>\n<p>I have no idea why we called this entity the Stack, considering the word&rsquo;s orderly connotations of squared-off edges and the shelving areas of libraries. It&rsquo;s true that the younger side of the Stack mounted toward the ceiling in relatively tidy fashion, like the floors of a high-rise&mdash;a concession to its greater proximity to the doorway, and thus to the more trafficked area of the bedroom, where a sudden collapse could have been catastrophic. But the original side was another story. Few generally vertical structures have ever been less stacklike, and no method of storing books has ever looked less like a shelf.</p>\n<p>Some people love books reverently&mdash;my great-aunt, for instance, a librarian and a passionate reader who declined to open any volume beyond a hundred-degree angle, so tenderly did she treat their spines. My father, by contrast, loved books ravenously. His always had a devoured look to them: scribbled on, folded over, cracked down the middle, liberally stained with coffee, Scotch, pistachio dust, and bits of the brightly colored shells of peanut M&amp;M&rsquo;s. (I have inherited his pragmatic attitude toward books and deliberately break the spine of every paperback I start, because I like to fold them in half while reading them.) In addition to the Stack, my father typically had on his bedside table the five or six books he was currently reading&mdash;a novel or two, a few works of nonfiction, a volume of poetry, &ldquo;Comprehensive Russian Grammar&rdquo; or some other textbooky thing&mdash;and when he finished one of these he would toss it into the space between the dresser and the wall. Compression and accumulation&mdash;especially accumulation&mdash;did the rest.</p>\n<p>To my regret, I have only a single photograph of the result. I have spent a great deal of time studying it, yet find many of the books in it impossible to identify. Some tumbled into the Stack spine in, rendering them wholly unknowable, while others fell victim to low resolution, including a few that are maddeningly familiar: an Oxford Anthology whose navy binding and gold stamp I recognize but whose spine is too blurry to read; a book that is unmistakably a Penguin Classic, but that hardly narrows it down; an Idiot&rsquo;s Guide to I don&rsquo;t know what. In some cases, I can make out the title but had to look up the author: &ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pirate-Latitudes-Michael-Crichton/dp/0061929387/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Pirate+Latitudes&qid=1552915618&s=books&sr=1-1\">Pirate Latitudes</a>&rdquo; (Michael Crichton), &ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mayflower-Story-Courage-Community-War/dp/0143111973/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3M4X8PPWWJTYJ&keywords=mayflower+philbrick&qid=1552915632&s=books&sprefix=Mayflower+phil%2Cstripbooks%2C116&sr=1-1\">Mayflower</a>&rdquo; (Nathaniel Philbrick), &ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Small-World-David-Lodge/dp/0140244867/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Small+World+lodge&qid=1552915645&s=books&sr=1-1\">Small World</a>&rdquo; (David Lodge), &ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Way-Things-Were-Novel-ebook/dp/B00R6E16ZQ/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=The+Way+Things+Were+taseer&qid=1552915661&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull\">The Way Things Were</a>&rdquo; (Aatish Taseer).

There were plenty of books in the new place, though, and a nice wide clearing by the side of the bed, so I suspect that, given enough time, it would have housed some kind of Stack 2.0. But it did not, because seven months after my parents moved in my father died.

                "text": "When I was a child, the grownup books in my house were arranged according to two principles. One of these, which governed the downstairs books, was instituted by my mother, and involved achieving a remarkable harmony\u2014one that anyone who has ever tried to organize a home library would envy\u2014among thematic, alphabetic, and aesthetic demands. The other, which governed the upstairs books, was instituted by my father, and was based on the conviction that it is very nice to have everything you\u2019ve recently read near at hand, in case you get the urge to consult any of it again; and also that it is a pain in the neck to put those books away, especially when the shelves on which they belong are so exquisitely organized that returning one to its appropriate slot requires not only a card catalogue but a crowbar.\nIt was this pair of convictions that led to the development of the Stack. I can\u2019t remember it in its early days, because in its early days it wasn\u2019t memorable. I suppose back then it was just a modest little pile of stray books, the kind that many readers have lying around in the living room or next to the bed. But by the time I was in my early teens it was the case\u2014and seemed by then to have always been the case\u2014that my parents\u2019 bedroom was home to the Mt. Kilimanjaro of books. Or perhaps more aptly the Mt. St. Helens of books, since it seemed possible that at any moment some subterranean shift in it might cause a cataclysm.\nThe Stack had started in a recessed space near my father\u2019s half of the bed, bounded on one side by a wall and on the other by my parents\u2019 dresser, a vertical behemoth taller than I would ever be. At some point in the Stack\u2019s development, it had overtopped that piece of furniture, whereupon it met a second tower of books, which, at some slightly later point, had begun growing up along the dresser\u2019s other side. For some reason, though, the Stack always looked to me as if it had defied gravity (or perhaps obeyed some other, more mysterious force) and grown down the far side of the dresser instead. At all events, the result was a kind of homemade Arc de Triomphe, extremely haphazard-looking but basically stable, made of some three or four hundred books.\nI have no idea why we called this entity the Stack, considering the word\u2019s orderly connotations of squared-off edges and the shelving areas of libraries. It\u2019s true that the younger side of the Stack mounted toward the ceiling in relatively tidy fashion, like the floors of a high-rise\u2014a concession to its greater proximity to the doorway, and thus to the more trafficked area of the bedroom, where a sudden collapse could have been catastrophic. But the original side was another story. Few generally vertical structures have ever been less stacklike, and no method of storing books has ever looked less like a shelf.\nSome people love books reverently\u2014my great-aunt, for instance, a librarian and a passionate reader who declined to open any volume beyond a hundred-degree angle, so tenderly did she treat their spines. My father, by contrast, loved books ravenously. His always had a devoured look to them: scribbled on, folded over, cracked down the middle, liberally stained with coffee, Scotch, pistachio dust, and bits of the brightly colored shells of peanut M&M\u2019s. (I have inherited his pragmatic attitude toward books and deliberately break the spine of every paperback I start, because I like to fold them in half while reading them.) In addition to the Stack, my father typically had on his bedside table the five or six books he was currently reading\u2014a novel or two, a few works of nonfiction, a volume of poetry, \u201cComprehensive Russian Grammar\u201d or some other textbooky thing\u2014and when he finished one of these he would toss it into the space between the dresser and the wall. Compression and accumulation\u2014especially accumulation\u2014did the rest.\nTo my regret, I have only a single photograph of the result. I have spent a great deal of time studying it, yet find many of the books in it impossible to identify. Some tumbled into the Stack spine in, rendering them wholly unknowable, while others fell victim to low resolution, including a few that are maddeningly familiar: an Oxford Anthology whose navy binding and gold stamp I recognize but whose spine is too blurry to read; a book that is unmistakably a Penguin Classic, but that hardly narrows it down; an Idiot\u2019s Guide to I don\u2019t know what. In some cases, I can make out the title but had to look up the author: \u201cPirate Latitudes\u201d (Michael Crichton), \u201cMayflower\u201d (Nathaniel Philbrick), \u201cSmall World\u201d (David Lodge), \u201cThe Way Things Were\u201d (Aatish Taseer). In others, conversely, I can see the author but not the title: something by Carl Hiaasen, something by Wally Lamb, something by Nadine Gordimer, something by Gore Vidal.\nPlenty of other books in the Stack, however, are perfectly visible, and perfectly familiar. There\u2019s the collected works of Edgar Allan Poe; there\u2019s \u201cPale Fire\u201d and \u201cWhite Teeth\u201d; there\u2019s \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d and \u201cAmerika.\u201d There\u2019s Wallace Stegner\u2019s \u201cAngle of Repose,\u201d a book my father mailed to me in my early twenties, together with \u201cOur Mutual Friend,\u201d when I was travelling and lonely and had run out of things to read. In the Stack, Stegner\u2019s novel has achieved its own angle of repose, alongside Richard Friedman\u2019s \u201cWho Wrote the Bible?\u201d and Antonio Damasio\u2019s \u201cThe Feeling of What Happens.\u201d Above that is Stephen E. Ambrose\u2019s \u201cUndaunted Courage,\u201d about Lewis and Clark\u2019s westward journey, and Diane McWhorter\u2019s \u201cCarry Me Home,\u201d about the civil-rights movement in Birmingham. There\u2019s Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cMason & Dixon\u201d and Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cThe Road,\u201d Michael Chabon\u2019s \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\u201d and Beryl Markham\u2019s \u201cWest with the Night.\u201d There are books I can remember discussing with my father\u2014Ian McEwan\u2019s \u201cAtonement,\u201d Jonathan Franzen\u2019s \u201cFreedom,\u201d Sarah Bakewell\u2019s \u201cHow to Live\u201d\u2014together with books I had no idea he\u2019d read and, despite his insatiable curiosity, no idea he would have cared to read: the Peterson Field Guide to Eastern Birds, Temple Grandin\u2019s \u201cAnimals in Translation,\u201d Neal Stephenson\u2019s \u201cCryptonomicon.\u201d\nI\u2019m not sure exactly when this photograph of the Stack was taken. It must have been after the fall of 2012, since one of the books visible is Stephen Greenblatt\u2019s \u201cThe Swerve,\u201d which came out in September of that year, and before 2016, when my parents moved out of their home of thirty years and into a condo, the kind with no stairs for them to fall down and less space to manage as they aged. There were plenty of books in the new place, though, and a nice wide clearing by the side of the bed, so I suspect that, given enough time, it would have housed some kind of Stack 2.0. But it did not, because seven months after my parents moved in my father died. On his bedside table at the time was a new edition of \u201cMiddlemarch,\u201d together with a copy of \u201cSPQR,\u201d Mary Beard\u2019s history of ancient Rome, and Kent Haruf\u2019s \u201cPlainsong.\u201d \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d my father regarded as the greatest novel in the English language and had been rereading for at least the sixth time. I don\u2019t know if he had completed either of the other two books, or even begun them. But it doesn\u2019t make any difference, I suppose. No matter when my father died, he would have been\u2014as, one way or another, we all are when we die\u2014in the middle of something.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH Throwing Shade Through Crosswords Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5d7967ef34e7944879ab6f9d.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://video.newyorker.com/watch/throwing-shade-through-crosswords/\nOur bad!

Whoever she might otherwise have been died then, too; the woman she became was volatile, unhappy, and inscrutable. My father was never even entirely sure how literate she was\u2014in any language, and least of all in English, which he himself began learning at the age of eleven, when the family arrived in the United States on refugee visas and settled in Detroit.",

The shocking result of the referendum on Britain&rsquo;s membership in the European Union had just been announced: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit\">Leave had won</a>.</p>\n<p>Banks, an entrepreneur whose fortune comes primarily from owning insurance companies, had financed and directed the most aggressive wing of the Leave campaign, Leave.EU, and he had given or loaned a total of thirteen million dollars to various anti-E.U. causes. In Britain, where campaign-spending laws have historically been stringent, and donations modest by American standards, Banks&rsquo;s contributions are thought to constitute the largest sum ever donated by an individual to a political campaign. Banks, who is fifty-two, is short and moonfaced, and often talks with a mischievous half smile; Wigmore, a former Conservative Party operative who serves as Banks&rsquo;s communications chief, also fifty-two, has floppy black hair and a chaotic manner. Virtually inseparable, and prone to boyish humor, they refer to each other as Banksy and Wiggy.</p>\n<p>Although the Leave campaign was officially led by Vote Leave, a group whose figureheads included the cabinet ministers <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> and Michael Gove, Banks believed that Leave&rsquo;s victory was in many ways <em>his</em> victory. He had given considerable financial support to <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nigel-farage\">Nigel Farage</a>, the sharp-tongued Euroskeptic, which had allowed Farage to remain at the center of the Brexit debate. Many experts also believed that the rambunctious Leave.EU campaign&mdash;which stoked fears of uncontrolled immigration&mdash;had roused voters who had been unmoved by the more technocratic messages of Vote Leave. A typical Leave.EU post on Facebook warned voters that &ldquo;<em>immigration without assimilation equals invasion.</em>&rdquo; A post about the dangers of &ldquo;free movement&rdquo; within the E.U. was accompanied by a photograph of ticking explosives.</p>\n<p>That night, Banks and Wigmore had stood by Farage&rsquo;s side as he proclaimed victory, at a crowded party on the banks of the Thames. Farage called the referendum &ldquo;a victory for ordinary people,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;We have fought against the multinationals, we have fought against the big merchant banks, we have fought against big politics, we have fought against lies, corruption, and deceit.&rdquo; He concluded, &ldquo;Let June the twenty-third go down in our history as our Independence Day!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Shortly after 5 <em>a.m</em>., Banks and Wigmore took the champagne and headed for a friend&rsquo;s apartment, to shower and change before making media appearances. On the way, they spotted an old man, in a tattered Barbour jacket, attempting to withdraw large sums of money from an A.T.M. The old man recognized them. He was terrified that the vote would cause a run on banks in the United Kingdom, and told them, in a fury, that they were responsible for whatever happened next.</p>\n<p>Banks and Wigmore found the situation profoundly comic. Their campaign had fought against such &ldquo;lies.&rdquo; A vote to leave the E.U. would not mean panic in the markets, or the collapse of British prosperity. Laughing, they assured the man that nothing of the sort would happen. Banks handed him the bottle of champagne, and urged him to celebrate. As Banks recalled it, &ldquo;He genuinely thought the world was going to come to an end!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Banks told me this story, alongside Wigmore, on a rainy November afternoon two and a half years later, at 5 Hertford Street&mdash;a private member&rsquo;s club, in Mayfair, where male guests are required to wear a formal jacket. The Brexit project that they had so ardently supported had left the U.K. in a state of panic. The government of Prime Minister <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/theresa-may\">Theresa May</a> had almost imploded several times. The withdrawal agreement that May had made with the E.U., which was intended to smooth the transition for both parties, pleased nobody, and the deadline for Britain&rsquo;s departure was approaching with the speed of a meteor. (Earlier this month, the impact seemed to have been slightly delayed when Parliament voted to postpone the onset of Brexit, originally set for March 29th, for a few weeks.) May was stuck in a dismal spot: if she couldn&rsquo;t get a deal ratified by Parliament, Brexit might well occur with no transition at all. Many economists believed that this scenario, known as &ldquo;no deal,&rdquo; would shake Britain, causing upheaval at its borders and shortages of food and medicine.</p>\n<p>This outcome was Banks&rsquo;s preferred result. &ldquo;No deal means we <em>leave</em>,&rdquo; he told me at the club.</p>\n<p>Banks was singularly calm about Brexit, but he had to contend with some issues of his own. At the request of the Electoral Commission, which oversees voting in the U.K., he was under investigation by the National Crime Agency&mdash;Britain&rsquo;s version of the F.B.I. The commission had asked the agency to investigate Banks and his chief executive, Liz Bilney, after concluding that, among other things, Banks was likely not the true source of all the political contributions made in his name, and that he and others might knowingly have concealed the provenance of those funds. It is illegal in the U.K. to use foreigners&rsquo; money in electoral campaigns. &ldquo;A number of criminal offences may have been committed,&rdquo; the commission declared. A spokesperson told me that Banks&rsquo;s and Bilney&rsquo;s stories had &ldquo;changed over time,&rdquo; and that what they told the commission was &ldquo;not consistent&rdquo; with company records. (Bilney says that this &ldquo;evolvement of response&rdquo; can be ascribed to the commission&rsquo;s failure to understand &ldquo;our business structures.&rdquo;)</p>\n<p>A sense of urgency attended the National Crime Agency&rsquo;s investigation, in part because of widespread fears in the U.K. that foreign actors had meddled in the Brexit vote. Although President <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/vladimir-putin\">Vladimir Putin</a> has claimed that Russia was ambivalent about the Brexit referendum, he recently pressed May to &ldquo;fulfill the will&rdquo; of the British people and rule out a second referendum on the U.K.&rsquo;s membership in the E.U.&mdash;which, polls suggest, would lead to a narrow win for Remain. Moreover, several authorities on Russian foreign policy argue that Putin&rsquo;s interests are squarely aligned with the Leave movement. Putin, they maintain, considers it strategically useful to weaken European alliances, and is happy to cause uncertainty and tumult in Britain, which has been at odds with Russia on a range of issues. In 2016, for instance, Russia was under sanctions from both the European Union and the United States for its annexation of Crimea.</p>\n<p>According to Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment, Russian officials believed that the West had been pursuing a &ldquo;regime-change agenda&rdquo; around the world, particularly in Ukraine in 2014, and worried that Putin&rsquo;s regime might be targeted next. &ldquo;Russia felt they needed to push back hard,&rdquo; Weiss told me. &ldquo;They wanted to promote cleavages in the West, and that&rsquo;s where their promotion of populist and nationalist groups and&mdash;I think&mdash;their support of Brexit fits in.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Banks&rsquo;s wife, Katya, is Russian. A prominent &ldquo;ambassador&rdquo; for Leave.EU, Jim Mellon, whom Banks has described as a &ldquo;friend and business partner,&rdquo; made much of his money by investing in Russia. (A representative for Mellon denied that Mellon has had a &ldquo;close business or professional relationship&rdquo; with Banks.) Banks&rsquo;s 2016 memoir, &ldquo;<a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Boys-Brexit-Guerrilla-Referendum/dp/1785901826/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\">The Bad Boys of Brexit</a>,&rdquo; acknowledges that before the referendum campaign he met with Russian officials, including Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian Ambassador to London. Subsequent reporting has uncovered several other previously undisclosed meetings and contacts between Banks and Russian businessmen, during which opportunities with Russian firms in the mineral sector were discussed. In light of these connections, and the National Crime Agency&rsquo;s investigation, many Britons have asked whether some of Banks&rsquo;s political donations can be traced to Moscow. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair&rsquo;s former communications chief, and an ardent Remainer, told me, &ldquo;There are still so many questions unanswered about Banks&mdash;where the money came from, and his role in the Brexit campaign of lies and misdemeanors.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The government of the U.K. has been strikingly muted in its response to the evidence of contacts between Banks and Russian diplomats. According to various reports, in the early months of 2016, while Theresa May was Home Secretary, she refused a request by British intelligence services to investigate Banks&rsquo;s conduct. Since becoming Prime Minister, that July, she has repeatedly declined to comment on these reports&mdash;including in Parliament. The subject is a delicate one for May. Although she campaigned for Remain, she has governed on the principle that Brexit is the people&rsquo;s choice and must be enforced. Given the tensions surrounding the referendum, she is unlikely to invite further probes into the financial background of one of the Leave campaign&rsquo;s key players. Doing so would be tantamount to using a grenade in a pub brawl.</p>",

                "text": "As the sun came up in London on June 24, 2016, Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore were walking through Westminster, the political district of London, smoking cigarettes and drinking champagne from the bottle. The shocking result of the referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union had just been announced: Leave had won.\nBanks, an entrepreneur whose fortune comes primarily from owning insurance companies, had financed and directed the most aggressive wing of the Leave campaign, Leave.EU, and he had given or loaned a total of thirteen million dollars to various anti-E.U. causes. In Britain, where campaign-spending laws have historically been stringent, and donations modest by American standards, Banks\u2019s contributions are thought to constitute the largest sum ever donated by an individual to a political campaign. Banks, who is fifty-two, is short and moonfaced, and often talks with a mischievous half smile; Wigmore, a former Conservative Party operative who serves as Banks\u2019s communications chief, also fifty-two, has floppy black hair and a chaotic manner. Virtually inseparable, and prone to boyish humor, they refer to each other as Banksy and Wiggy.\nAlthough the Leave campaign was officially led by Vote Leave, a group whose figureheads included the cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, Banks believed that Leave\u2019s victory was in many ways his victory. He had given considerable financial support to Nigel Farage, the sharp-tongued Euroskeptic, which had allowed Farage to remain at the center of the Brexit debate. Many experts also believed that the rambunctious Leave.EU campaign\u2014which stoked fears of uncontrolled immigration\u2014had roused voters who had been unmoved by the more technocratic messages of Vote Leave. A typical Leave.EU post on Facebook warned voters that \u201cimmigration without assimilation equals invasion.\u201d A post about the dangers of \u201cfree movement\u201d within the E.U. was accompanied by a photograph of ticking explosives.\nThat night, Banks and Wigmore had stood by Farage\u2019s side as he proclaimed victory, at a crowded party on the banks of the Thames. Farage called the referendum \u201ca victory for ordinary people,\u201d adding, \u201cWe have fought against the multinationals, we have fought against the big merchant banks, we have fought against big politics, we have fought against lies, corruption, and deceit.\u201d He concluded, \u201cLet June the twenty-third go down in our history as our Independence Day!\u201d\nShortly after 5 a.m., Banks and Wigmore took the champagne and headed for a friend\u2019s apartment, to shower and change before making media appearances. On the way, they spotted an old man, in a tattered Barbour jacket, attempting to withdraw large sums of money from an A.T.M. The old man recognized them. He was terrified that the vote would cause a run on banks in the United Kingdom, and told them, in a fury, that they were responsible for whatever happened next.\nBanks and Wigmore found the situation profoundly comic. Their campaign had fought against such \u201clies.\u201d A vote to leave the E.U. would not mean panic in the markets, or the collapse of British prosperity. Laughing, they assured the man that nothing of the sort would happen. Banks handed him the bottle of champagne, and urged him to celebrate. As Banks recalled it, \u201cHe genuinely thought the world was going to come to an end!\u201d\nBanks told me this story, alongside Wigmore, on a rainy November afternoon two and a half years later, at 5 Hertford Street\u2014a private member\u2019s club, in Mayfair, where male guests are required to wear a formal jacket. The Brexit project that they had so ardently supported had left the U.K. in a state of panic. The government of Prime Minister Theresa May had almost imploded several times. The withdrawal agreement that May had made with the E.U., which was intended to smooth the transition for both parties, pleased nobody, and the deadline for Britain\u2019s departure was approaching with the speed of a meteor. (Earlier this month, the impact seemed to have been slightly delayed when Parliament voted to postpone the onset of Brexit, originally set for March 29th, for a few weeks.) May was stuck in a dismal spot: if she couldn\u2019t get a deal ratified by Parliament, Brexit might well occur with no transition at all. Many economists believed that this scenario, known as \u201cno deal,\u201d would shake Britain, causing upheaval at its borders and shortages of food and medicine.\nThis outcome was Banks\u2019s preferred result. \u201cNo deal means we leave,\u201d he told me at the club.\nBanks was singularly calm about Brexit, but he had to contend with some issues of his own. At the request of the Electoral Commission, which oversees voting in the U.K., he was under investigation by the National Crime Agency\u2014Britain\u2019s version of the F.B.I. The commission had asked the agency to investigate Banks and his chief executive, Liz Bilney, after concluding that, among other things, Banks was likely not the true source of all the political contributions made in his name, and that he and others might knowingly have concealed the provenance of those funds. It is illegal in the U.K. to use foreigners\u2019 money in electoral campaigns. \u201cA number of criminal offences may have been committed,\u201d the commission declared. A spokesperson told me that Banks\u2019s and Bilney\u2019s stories had \u201cchanged over time,\u201d and that what they told the commission was \u201cnot consistent\u201d with company records. (Bilney says that this \u201cevolvement of response\u201d can be ascribed to the commission\u2019s failure to understand \u201cour business structures.\u201d)\nA sense of urgency attended the National Crime Agency\u2019s investigation, in part because of widespread fears in the U.K. that foreign actors had meddled in the Brexit vote. Although President Vladimir Putin has claimed that Russia was ambivalent about the Brexit referendum, he recently pressed May to \u201cfulfill the will\u201d of the British people and rule out a second referendum on the U.K.\u2019s membership in the E.U.\u2014which, polls suggest, would lead to a narrow win for Remain. Moreover, several authorities on Russian foreign policy argue that Putin\u2019s interests are squarely aligned with the Leave movement. Putin, they maintain, considers it strategically useful to weaken European alliances, and is happy to cause uncertainty and tumult in Britain, which has been at odds with Russia on a range of issues. In 2016, for instance, Russia was under sanctions from both the European Union and the United States for its annexation of Crimea.\nAccording to Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment, Russian officials believed that the West had been pursuing a \u201cregime-change agenda\u201d around the world, particularly in Ukraine in 2014, and worried that Putin\u2019s regime might be targeted next. \u201cRussia felt they needed to push back hard,\u201d Weiss told me. \u201cThey wanted to promote cleavages in the West, and that\u2019s where their promotion of populist and nationalist groups and\u2014I think\u2014their support of Brexit fits in.\u201d\nBanks\u2019s wife, Katya, is Russian. A prominent \u201cambassador\u201d for Leave.EU, Jim Mellon, whom Banks has described as a \u201cfriend and business partner,\u201d made much of his money by investing in Russia. (A representative for Mellon denied that Mellon has had a \u201cclose business or professional relationship\u201d with Banks.) Banks\u2019s 2016 memoir, \u201cThe Bad Boys of Brexit,\u201d acknowledges that before the referendum campaign he met with Russian officials, including Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian Ambassador to London. Subsequent reporting has uncovered several other previously undisclosed meetings and contacts between Banks and Russian businessmen, during which opportunities with Russian firms in the mineral sector were discussed. In light of these connections, and the National Crime Agency\u2019s investigation, many Britons have asked whether some of Banks\u2019s political donations can be traced to Moscow. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief, and an ardent Remainer, told me, \u201cThere are still so many questions unanswered about Banks\u2014where the money came from, and his role in the Brexit campaign of lies and misdemeanors.\u201d\nThe government of the U.K. has been strikingly muted in its response to the evidence of contacts between Banks and Russian diplomats. According to various reports, in the early months of 2016, while Theresa May was Home Secretary, she refused a request by British intelligence services to investigate Banks\u2019s conduct. Since becoming Prime Minister, that July, she has repeatedly declined to comment on these reports\u2014including in Parliament. The subject is a delicate one for May. Although she campaigned for Remain, she has governed on the principle that Brexit is the people\u2019s choice and must be enforced. Given the tensions surrounding the referendum, she is unlikely to invite further probes into the financial background of one of the Leave campaign\u2019s key players. Doing so would be tantamount to using a grenade in a pub brawl.",

The resolution is certain to pass the Democrat-controlled House, likely to pass the Senate, and all but certain to fail a veto-override vote once Trump inevitably rejects it.</p>\n<p>Debate began around noon, with a speech by Representative Norma Torres, of California, who compared Trump to Venezuela&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trump-says-that-nicolas-maduro-is-no-longer-venezuelas-president-maduro-disagrees\">Nicol&aacute;s Maduro</a> and argued that the emergency declaration amounted to creeping authoritarianism. &ldquo;Mr. Speaker,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we cannot allow this President, or any President&mdash;Republican or Democrat&mdash;to take us down the same path of Venezuela, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. All to build a wasteful and ineffective wall along our southern border.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Representative Rob Woodall, of Georgia, kicked things off on the Republican side with a speech noting the speed with which Democrats advanced the resolution. &ldquo;A minute and six seconds it took to read the resolution before us today, Mr. Speaker,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s a minute and six seconds longer than this resolution has been considered in total in every committee throughout this Capitol.&rdquo; He went on, &ldquo;You heard my colleague talk about how critical this resolution of disapproval is as it relates to our constitutional powers. You heard [the emergency declaration] described as a power grab equivalent to those of discredited despots. And we haven&rsquo;t talked about it at all in this chamber, in these committees&mdash;not one witness has testified.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Representative Mo Brooks, of Alabama, echoed Trump in his renderings of the havoc supposedly wrought by undocumented immigrants. &ldquo;In fiscal year 2018, more than two thousand illegal aliens were apprehended by federal agents for homicides committed on American soil. Worse yet, roughly thirty-one thousand Americans die each year of heroin and cocaine overdoses, ninety per cent of which flows across America&rsquo;s porous southern border. Hence, we can expect at least thirty-three thousand dead Americans each year until America secures our porous southern border.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mr. Speaker,&rdquo; Brooks bellowed, &ldquo;how many dead Americans does it take for open-border advocates to support border security? How much American blood must be on guilty hands before Congress recognizes the national emergency we face at America&rsquo;s southern border?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Torres could have replied a number of ways. By stating that the majority of drugs that come across the border are smuggled in through established ports of entry rather than through the stretches of land that a border wall would be built across. Or noting that the available data shows that two thousand illegal immigrants were not actually arrested for homicide in 2018, and that research has consistently shown that immigrants do not commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans. But Torres, who was born in Guatemala and was brought to the United States when she was five, responded with a question of her own.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mr. Speaker, we can talk about the scary people from our southern border,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that scary-looking, am I?&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "On Tuesday, Congress began considering a resolution that would end the national emergency that President Trump has declared at the southern border in order to secure the funds to construct a border wall, which Congress has repeatedly denied him. The resolution is certain to pass the Democrat-controlled House, likely to pass the Senate, and all but certain to fail a veto-override vote once Trump inevitably rejects it.\nDebate began around noon, with a speech by Representative Norma Torres, of California, who compared Trump to Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and argued that the emergency declaration amounted to creeping authoritarianism. \u201cMr. Speaker,\u201d she said, \u201cwe cannot allow this President, or any President\u2014Republican or Democrat\u2014to take us down the same path of Venezuela, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. All to build a wasteful and ineffective wall along our southern border.\u201d\nRepresentative Rob Woodall, of Georgia, kicked things off on the Republican side with a speech noting the speed with which Democrats advanced the resolution. \u201cA minute and six seconds it took to read the resolution before us today, Mr. Speaker,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a minute and six seconds longer than this resolution has been considered in total in every committee throughout this Capitol.\u201d He went on, \u201cYou heard my colleague talk about how critical this resolution of disapproval is as it relates to our constitutional powers. You heard [the emergency declaration] described as a power grab equivalent to those of discredited despots. And we haven\u2019t talked about it at all in this chamber, in these committees\u2014not one witness has testified.\u201d\nRepresentative Mo Brooks, of Alabama, echoed Trump in his renderings of the havoc supposedly wrought by undocumented immigrants. \u201cIn fiscal year 2018, more than two thousand illegal aliens were apprehended by federal agents for homicides committed on American soil. Worse yet, roughly thirty-one thousand Americans die each year of heroin and cocaine overdoses, ninety per cent of which flows across America\u2019s porous southern border. Hence, we can expect at least thirty-three thousand dead Americans each year until America secures our porous southern border.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Speaker,\u201d Brooks bellowed, \u201chow many dead Americans does it take for open-border advocates to support border security? How much American blood must be on guilty hands before Congress recognizes the national emergency we face at America\u2019s southern border?\u201d\nTorres could have replied a number of ways. By stating that the majority of drugs that come across the border are smuggled in through established ports of entry rather than through the stretches of land that a border wall would be built across. Or noting that the available data shows that two thousand illegal immigrants were not actually arrested for homicide in 2018, and that research has consistently shown that immigrants do not commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans. But Torres, who was born in Guatemala and was brought to the United States when she was five, responded with a question of her own.\n\u201cMr. Speaker, we can talk about the scary people from our southern border,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not that scary-looking, am I?\u201d",

He first addressed Trump&rsquo;s attacks on the media. &ldquo;Understand what that means,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is an attack on the very fundamentals of American democracy.&rdquo; Then he turned to how he will approach the campaign. The discussion wouldn&rsquo;t be with Trump, he said, but with his supporters. &ldquo;I go not only into communities which are progressive or Democratic&mdash;we head out to Trump country,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And we are going to talk to those people, and we are going to expose Trump as the liar and fraud that he is. Trump told working people that he was going to be on their side. He is not on their side.&rdquo; By the end of the campaign, Sanders said, &ldquo;I suspect that a number of people who voted for <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a> will understand that he is not their friend.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>CNN&rsquo;s Wolf Blitzer, who served as moderator, pressed Sanders on a more specific point. If he were on a debate stage with Trump, Blitzer asked, how would Sanders &ldquo;engage&rdquo; with him? Sanders, so often deadly serious during campaign events, offered a joke: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring a lie detector along, and every time he lies it goes <em>beep</em>.&rdquo; Then Sanders, with his usual constancy, returned to his earlier point. &ldquo;I have conservative friends; we all do,&rdquo; Sanders said. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re honest people. They believe what they believe, I believe what I believe. And that&rsquo;s called democracy, that&rsquo;s a good thing. But I think the fraud that Trump is, the pathological liar that he is, has to be exposed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Democrats who have put themselves forward as Presidential candidates have resisted framing the 2020 election as simply a referendum on Trump. Elizabeth Warren has <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/02/09/warren_launches_2020_campaign_trump_a_symptom_of_whats_gone_wrong_in_america.html\">described</a> the President as &ldquo;just the latest and most extreme symptom of what has gone wrong in America.&rdquo; Cory Booker has <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/cory-booker-running-for-president-no-haters-proposition\">said</a> he is &ldquo;going to run a race about not who I&rsquo;m against or what I&rsquo;m against but who I&rsquo;m for and what I&rsquo;m for.&rdquo; Kamala Harris prefers talking about restoring &ldquo;truth&rdquo; and &ldquo;justice&rdquo; to calling Trump out by name on the stump. Sanders has his own broad progressive agenda. But on Monday, pushed to offer his plans to confront Trump, he drew a bright line between Trump and the voters who made him President. The path to a post-Trump country, Sanders said, runs through Trump country.</p>",

                "text": "During CNN\u2019s televised town-hall event with Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday night, a Howard University student named Osara Grayson stood up to ask the newly announced Democratic Presidential candidate a question. \u201cIn a political climate where we see the current President and his followers using terms such as \u2018fake news\u2019 or \u2018alternative facts,\u2019 \u201d Grayson said, reading from a notecard, \u201chow do you plan to have a productive discussion with someone who is unwilling to accept facts?\u201d\nSanders, standing on the stage, nodded. He first addressed Trump\u2019s attacks on the media. \u201cUnderstand what that means,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an attack on the very fundamentals of American democracy.\u201d Then he turned to how he will approach the campaign. The discussion wouldn\u2019t be with Trump, he said, but with his supporters. \u201cI go not only into communities which are progressive or Democratic\u2014we head out to Trump country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are going to talk to those people, and we are going to expose Trump as the liar and fraud that he is. Trump told working people that he was going to be on their side. He is not on their side.\u201d By the end of the campaign, Sanders said, \u201cI suspect that a number of people who voted for Donald Trump will understand that he is not their friend.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, who served as moderator, pressed Sanders on a more specific point. If he were on a debate stage with Trump, Blitzer asked, how would Sanders \u201cengage\u201d with him? Sanders, so often deadly serious during campaign events, offered a joke: \u201cWe\u2019ll bring a lie detector along, and every time he lies it goes beep.\u201d Then Sanders, with his usual constancy, returned to his earlier point. \u201cI have conservative friends; we all do,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re honest people. They believe what they believe, I believe what I believe. And that\u2019s called democracy, that\u2019s a good thing. But I think the fraud that Trump is, the pathological liar that he is, has to be exposed.\u201d\nDemocrats who have put themselves forward as Presidential candidates have resisted framing the 2020 election as simply a referendum on Trump. Elizabeth Warren has described the President as \u201cjust the latest and most extreme symptom of what has gone wrong in America.\u201d Cory Booker has said he is \u201cgoing to run a race about not who I\u2019m against or what I\u2019m against but who I\u2019m for and what I\u2019m for.\u201d Kamala Harris prefers talking about restoring \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d to calling Trump out by name on the stump. Sanders has his own broad progressive agenda. But on Monday, pushed to offer his plans to confront Trump, he drew a bright line between Trump and the voters who made him President. The path to a post-Trump country, Sanders said, runs through Trump country.",

A group of school students, at least one as young as seven, went to the senator&rsquo;s San Francisco office to ask her to support the Green New Deal climate legislation. In a video posted online by the Sunrise Movement, she tells them that the resolution isn&rsquo;t a good one, because it can&rsquo;t be paid for, and the Republicans in the Senate won&rsquo;t support it. She adds that she is at work on her own resolution, which she thinks could pass. Then, when the group persists in supporting the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/with-the-green-new-deal-democrats-present-a-radical-proposition-for-combatting-climate-change\">Green New Deal</a>, which was introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Feinstein responds, &ldquo;You know what&rsquo;s interesting about this group? I&rsquo;ve been doing this for thirty years. I know what I&rsquo;m doing. You come in here and you say, &lsquo;It has to be my way or the highway.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t respond to that. I&rsquo;ve gotten elected, I just ran, I was elected by almost a million-vote plurality,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;And I know what I&rsquo;m doing. So, you know, maybe people should listen a little bit.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Well, maybe. But Feinstein was, in fact, demonstrating why climate change exemplifies an issue on which older people should listen to the young. Because&mdash;to put it bluntly&mdash;older generations will be dead before the worst of it hits. The kids whom Feinstein was talking to are going to be dealing with climate chaos for the rest of their lives, as any Californian who has lived through the past few years of drought, flood, and fire must recognize.</p>\n<p>This means that youth carry the moral authority here, and, at the very least, should be treated with the solicitousness due a generation that older ones have managed to screw over. Feinstein&rsquo;s condescension, though it&rsquo;s less jarring in <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2101109139978731&id=263615334116809&__tn__=%2AW-R\">the video of the full encounter</a>, which also shows gracious moments&mdash;including one when she offers a young person an internship&mdash;echoed that of Nancy Pelosi, from earlier this month, when the Speaker of the House talked about &ldquo;the green dream, or whatever they call it. Nobody knows what it is, but they&rsquo;re for it, right?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This smugness stings&mdash;although, of course, it stings far less than the climate denialism emanating from the White House. But that&rsquo;s not really the problem. The problem is that, even if you give Feinstein every benefit of the doubt, her response illustrates the fix we&rsquo;re in. Later Friday evening, Feinstein&rsquo;s aides released <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/b/5/b54a564f-f750-48b4-99fe-3608d626a1bc/19EB91A5CF1C8211EF585179F7BB0E73.2019.02.22-climate-change-resolution.pdf\">portions of her proposal</a>, and on first view they appear to be warmed-over versions of Obama-era environmental policy: respect for the Paris climate accord, a commitment to a mid-century conversion to renewable energy.</p>\n<figure><figure> <video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5d7967ef34e7944879ab6f9d/0087691f-c43c-458a-b548-97a9d4aa2970high.mp4?videoIndex=0&requester=oo\"><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video><iframe src=\"https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.365.1_en.html#goog_285551624\"></iframe><video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5d7967ef34e7944879ab6f9d/0087691f-c43c-458a-b548-97a9d4aa2970thumbs.mp4\"></video> WATCH Throwing Shade Through Crosswords Share Tweet Email More... <h4>EMBED URL</h4>&lt;script async src=&quot;//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5d7967ef34e7944879ab6f9d.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<h4>VIDEO URL</h4>https://video.newyorker.com/watch/throwing-shade-through-crosswords/<h4>Our bad!

Not insufficient&mdash;and here&rsquo;s the important point&mdash;to meet the demands of hopelessly idealistic youth but because of the point that the kids were trying to make, which is that the passage of time is changing the calculations around climate change.</p>\n<p>Feinstein is, in fact, right: on most questions, a &ldquo;my way or the highway&rdquo; attitude doesn&rsquo;t get you very far. If I&rsquo;m a lawmaker and I think that the minimum wage should be thirty dollars an hour, and you&rsquo;re one who thinks that eight dollars is generous, we&rsquo;ll probably try to pass a law that sets the mark somewhere near fifteen dollars, and then argue about it again after the next election. There would be no point in holding out for what I can&rsquo;t get. But, in the case of the environment, the opponent is not the Chamber of Commerce. The opponent is physics, and physics doesn&rsquo;t negotiate. It&rsquo;s not moved by appeals to centrist moderation, or explanations about the filibuster. And it has set a firm time limit. Scientists have told us what we must do and by when, and so legislators must do all they can to match those targets. The beauty of the Green New Deal legislation is not that it&rsquo;s shiny or progressive or a poke in the eye to the oil companies. Its beauty is that it actually tries to meet the target that science has given us.</p>\n<p>The irony is that, when Feinstein said she&rsquo;s been &ldquo;doing this for thirty years,&rdquo; she described the precise time period during which we could have acted. James Hansen brought the climate question to widespread attention with his <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/24/us/global-warming-has-begun-expert-tells-senate.html\">congressional testimony</a> in 1988. If we&rsquo;d moved thirty years ago, moderate steps of the kind that Feinstein proposes would have been enough to change our trajectory. But that didn&rsquo;t get done, in large part because oil and gas companies that have successfully gamed our political system didn&rsquo;t want it to get done. And the legislators didn&rsquo;t do anywhere near enough to fight them. So now we&rsquo;re on the precipice. Indeed, we&rsquo;re over it. The fires that raged in California last fall were the fires of a hell on earth.</p>\n<p>Given the failure of old-style politics on this issue, it is no surprise that youth are taking the initiative. Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest congresswoman in American history. The Green New Deal was hatched by the Sunrise Movement, which is composed of recent college graduates. And they are ancient compared with the sixteen-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who was in Paris last week to <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2019/02/22/les-jeunes-appeles-a-manifester-a-paris-pour-le-climat_5426651_3244.html\">watch thousands of French youths</a> join her in spreading the Friday for Future strikes, in which students skip school to demonstrate for climate action.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t vote for me,&rdquo; Feinstein said to one of the young people in her office. Which was true, because the girl in question is sixteen. In our reigning political calculus, that makes her powerless&mdash;she can&rsquo;t vote and she doesn&rsquo;t have money to give. But that calculus must shift; the job of older people, at this late date, is to have the backs of the young. We have skills to bring to the task: Feinstein has amassed a career&rsquo;s worth of legislative savvy, and she can put it to good use here; Ocasio-Cortez could doubtless use the help. But, having blown our chance at leading, it&rsquo;s time for those of us of a certain age to follow, with all the grace that we can still muster.</p>",

                "text": "One imagines that Senator Dianne Feinstein would like a do-over of her colloquy with some young people on Friday afternoon. A group of school students, at least one as young as seven, went to the senator\u2019s San Francisco office to ask her to support the Green New Deal climate legislation. In a video posted online by the Sunrise Movement, she tells them that the resolution isn\u2019t a good one, because it can\u2019t be paid for, and the Republicans in the Senate won\u2019t support it. She adds that she is at work on her own resolution, which she thinks could pass. Then, when the group persists in supporting the Green New Deal, which was introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Feinstein responds, \u201cYou know what\u2019s interesting about this group? I\u2019ve been doing this for thirty years. I know what I\u2019m doing. You come in here and you say, \u2018It has to be my way or the highway.\u2019 I don\u2019t respond to that. I\u2019ve gotten elected, I just ran, I was elected by almost a million-vote plurality,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd I know what I\u2019m doing. So, you know, maybe people should listen a little bit.\u201d\nWell, maybe. But Feinstein was, in fact, demonstrating why climate change exemplifies an issue on which older people should listen to the young. Because\u2014to put it bluntly\u2014older generations will be dead before the worst of it hits. The kids whom Feinstein was talking to are going to be dealing with climate chaos for the rest of their lives, as any Californian who has lived through the past few years of drought, flood, and fire must recognize.\nThis means that youth carry the moral authority here, and, at the very least, should be treated with the solicitousness due a generation that older ones have managed to screw over. Feinstein\u2019s condescension, though it\u2019s less jarring in the video of the full encounter, which also shows gracious moments\u2014including one when she offers a young person an internship\u2014echoed that of Nancy Pelosi, from earlier this month, when the Speaker of the House talked about \u201cthe green dream, or whatever they call it. Nobody knows what it is, but they\u2019re for it, right?\u201d\nThis smugness stings\u2014although, of course, it stings far less than the climate denialism emanating from the White House. But that\u2019s not really the problem. The problem is that, even if you give Feinstein every benefit of the doubt, her response illustrates the fix we\u2019re in. Later Friday evening, Feinstein\u2019s aides released portions of her proposal, and on first view they appear to be warmed-over versions of Obama-era environmental policy: respect for the Paris climate accord, a commitment to a mid-century conversion to renewable energy.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH Throwing Shade Through Crosswords Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5d7967ef34e7944879ab6f9d.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://video.newyorker.com/watch/throwing-shade-through-crosswords/\nOur bad!

It\u2019s that they are insufficient, impossibly so. Not insufficient\u2014and here\u2019s the important point\u2014to meet the demands of hopelessly idealistic youth but because of the point that the kids were trying to make, which is that the passage of time is changing the calculations around climate change.\nFeinstein is, in fact, right: on most questions, a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d attitude doesn\u2019t get you very far. If I\u2019m a lawmaker and I think that the minimum wage should be thirty dollars an hour, and you\u2019re one who thinks that eight dollars is generous, we\u2019ll probably try to pass a law that sets the mark somewhere near fifteen dollars, and then argue about it again after the next election. There would be no point in holding out for what I can\u2019t get. But, in the case of the environment, the opponent is not the Chamber of Commerce. The opponent is physics, and physics doesn\u2019t negotiate. It\u2019s not moved by appeals to centrist moderation, or explanations about the filibuster. And it has set a firm time limit. Scientists have told us what we must do and by when, and so legislators must do all they can to match those targets. The beauty of the Green New Deal legislation is not that it\u2019s shiny or progressive or a poke in the eye to the oil companies. Its beauty is that it actually tries to meet the target that science has given us.\nThe irony is that, when Feinstein said she\u2019s been \u201cdoing this for thirty years,\u201d she described the precise time period during which we could have acted. James Hansen brought the climate question to widespread attention with his congressional testimony in 1988. If we\u2019d moved thirty years ago, moderate steps of the kind that Feinstein proposes would have been enough to change our trajectory. But that didn\u2019t get done, in large part because oil and gas companies that have successfully gamed our political system didn\u2019t want it to get done. And the legislators didn\u2019t do anywhere near enough to fight them. So now we\u2019re on the precipice. Indeed, we\u2019re over it. The fires that raged in California last fall were the fires of a hell on earth.\nGiven the failure of old-style politics on this issue, it is no surprise that youth are taking the initiative. Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest congresswoman in American history. The Green New Deal was hatched by the Sunrise Movement, which is composed of recent college graduates. And they are ancient compared with the sixteen-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who was in Paris last week to watch thousands of French youths join her in spreading the Friday for Future strikes, in which students skip school to demonstrate for climate action.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t vote for me,\u201d Feinstein said to one of the young people in her office. Which was true, because the girl in question is sixteen. In our reigning political calculus, that makes her powerless\u2014she can\u2019t vote and she doesn\u2019t have money to give. But that calculus must shift; the job of older people, at this late date, is to have the backs of the young. We have skills to bring to the task: Feinstein has amassed a career\u2019s worth of legislative savvy, and she can put it to good use here; Ocasio-Cortez could doubtless use the help. But, having blown our chance at leading, it\u2019s time for those of us of a certain age to follow, with all the grace that we can still muster.",

After five years of conflict, few of their governments have stepped up to take them back.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A few days before <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-trump-betrayed-the-general-who-defeated-isis\">the collapse of the Islamic State&rsquo;s caliphate</a>, I visited one of the new &ldquo;pop-up prisons&rdquo; that had been hastily converted to hold thousands of surrendering <em>ISIS</em> fighters in Syria. The numbers wildly exceeded all expectations, including estimates by U.S. intelligence. The most striking sight at the prison entrance was a mound of human hair lying on the raw concrete floor. Clumps of it&mdash;some brown, some graying, most of it greasy or matted&mdash;had been shaved off the heads and faces of fighters before they were taken to group cells. &ldquo;Lice,&rdquo; one of the guards told me.</p>\n<p>The prison at Dashisha, in eastern Deir Ezzor province, had been an oil-storage facility. In just four days, the compound of modest brick and stucco buildings had been filled with fifteen hundred fighters from countries on four continents, including France, Libya, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Iraq, and the United States, the warden told me. Average-sized rooms had been fitted with metal doors; each cell had a small barred window that I had to stand on my tiptoes to peer through. Each one was crammed, wall to wall, with dozens of men squatting on the floor. The <em>ISIS</em> fighters wore new T-shirts, in army green, and whatever trousers they had on when they were captured.</p>\n<p>After five years of war with the Islamic State, the biggest problem for the winners is coping with the losers. The aftermath has produced one of the world&rsquo;s most perplexing postwar challenges: there are tens of thousands of captured <em>ISIS</em> members whom no nation wants to repatriate, and the local militia holding them has neither the resources nor the personnel to keep them indefinitely. More than five thousand <em>ISIS</em> fighters surrendered in the final month of fighting alone. Thousands more were captured earlier in the conflict. They&rsquo;re dispersed among the new pop-up prisons in northeast Syria. A few hundred of the most severely wounded are in a small hospital, with the foreign fighters crowded in its basement for security. The hospital stench was overwhelming, even through a mask. &ldquo;Sepsis,&rdquo; a medic told me. Between December and March, another sixty-three thousand family members of <em>ISIS</em> fighters&mdash;wives enveloped in black niqabs that cover their faces, and bedraggled young children&mdash;also poured out of Baghouz, the last <em>ISIS</em> redoubt in Syria. They&rsquo;re held separately, most in tents, at a dusty, malodorous camp in al-Hawl that already held ten thousand. The prisons, the hospital, and the camp are all bursting.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is nothing else in the world that compares to this unprecedented humanitarian and security situation, which is legally complicated and politically fraught,&rdquo; a senior State Department official told me. So far, the local Syrian Democratic Forces militia (S.D.F.), the U.S.-led coalition of more than seventy countries, and several international relief agencies have been improvising&mdash;total ad-hockery, in the words of a senior U.S. military commander involved in Syria.</p>\n<p>Just sorting out the fighters&rsquo; real names and nationalities has been messy. Many use noms de guerre. Few have identity papers or passports. Some don&rsquo;t want to reveal their identities&mdash;or their roles with <em>ISIS</em>. I interviewed three of the prison&rsquo;s foreign detainees: a middle-aged misfit from Chicago, who was lured to Syria by <em>ISIS</em> propaganda; a Moroccan who, as an &ldquo;emir of morality,&rdquo; acknowledged witnessing at least ten stonings of women accused of adultery and the burning of some forty Yazidi women who were put in a cage, covered with fuel, and set on fire; and a lanky Turk with a prosthetic leg, which was his souvenir from a U.S. air strike. The Turk, Farouk Asser, insisted that he once worked at a pizza parlor in Istanbul and, after joining <em>ISIS</em>, merely worked as a cook and at a local police station. Every few sentences, the warden muttered, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a liar. He&rsquo;s a liar.&rdquo; Asser, according to the warden, was one of the early <em>ISIS</em> recruiters who helped foreign fighters cross the border from Turkey into Syria.</p>\n<p>The pop-up prisons are combustible politically and vulnerable physically, a dozen U.S. diplomats and military officials told me. <em>ISIS</em> has its roots in an earlier prison culture&mdash;notably in Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca, two infamous prisons in Iraq that were run by the United States between 2003 and 2011. Its founding &ldquo;caliph,&rdquo; Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"http://www.soufangroup.com/tsg-intelbrief-from-bucca-to-kobani-the-hybrid-ideology-of-the-islamic-state/\">held</a> at Camp Bucca for nine months, in 2004. He and other future <em>ISIS</em> leaders created an embryonic network there.</p>\n<p>The movement grew rapidly after Baghdadi <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"http://www.understandingwar.org/report/al-qaeda-iraq-resurgent\">pronounced</a>, in 2012, that its <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2013/sep/15/500-escape-from-abu-ghraib-and-taji-prisons-in-iraq/\">first priority</a> should be &ldquo;releasing Muslim prisoners everywhere, and chasing and eliminating judges and investigators and their guards.&rdquo; Over the next year, Al Qaeda in Iraq attacked eight prisons. In July, 2013, more than five hundred inmates&mdash;including top Al Qaeda leaders <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2013/sep/15/500-escape-from-abu-ghraib-and-taji-prisons-in-iraq/\">sentenced</a> to death&mdash;were freed in final simultaneous <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-violence-alqaeda/al-qaeda-says-it-freed-500-inmates-in-iraq-jail-break-idUSBRE96M0C720130723\">attacks</a> on two prisons, including Abu Ghraib. Many inmates escaped into Syria, where Al Qaeda in Iraq evolved into the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. The prison raids&mdash;the so-called breaking-the-walls campaign&mdash;provided the first evidence that Baghdadi&rsquo;s men were &ldquo;a professional military force capable of planning, training, resourcing and executing synchronized and complex attacks,&rdquo; as the Institute for the Study of War reported. By 2014, <em>ISIS</em> had enough men to blitz across Syria and Iraq, and captured territory the size of Britain. Despite its recent loss of terrain in both Syria and Iraq, U.S. military and S.D.F. officials told me, <em>ISIS</em> underground cells still have those basic capabilities. Prison breaks, they added, are almost certain to be one way that the group tries to rebuild.</p>\n<figure><figcaption data-event-boundary=\"click\" data-event-click=\"{\" data-in-view=\"{\" data-include-experiments=\"true\">&ldquo;My goal wasn&rsquo;t to come fight, it was making hegira,&rdquo; or to re-create the Prophet Muhammad&rsquo;s migration from Mecca to Medina, Lirim Sulejmani, an American prisoner from Chicago, said.Photograph Courtesy Robin Wright</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The first prisoner I interviewed at Dashisha was Lirim Sulejmani, the American from Chicago. He had surrendered two weeks earlier. He was balding and thin; he told me that he was forty-three. His arms were awkwardly handcuffed behind him with thin plastic bands. He seemed detached, and both physically and psychologically defeated. We sat on the floor of the prison&rsquo;s makeshift office, which had no furniture. His wife and three children were probably at the al-Hawl camp, he said, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure. He was sucked into <em>ISIS</em> by its utopian promises. &ldquo;I wanted to make hegira,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;I wanted to live under Sharia,&rdquo; or Islamic law. Hegira, traditionally used to describe the Prophet Muhammad&rsquo;s <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Hijrah-Islam\">migration</a> from Mecca to Medina to escape persecution, had become an <em>ISIS</em> buzzword&mdash;and a <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"http://www.themontrealreview.com/2009/Hijra-before-ISIS.php\">recruiting tool</a>. The pull is as powerful as the idea of jihad. After Baghdadi declared the Islamic State, in 2014, he appealed to Muslims worldwide to make hegira, to re-create a country that ruled as in the Prophet&rsquo;s time, fourteen centuries ago.</p>\n<p>Up to three hundred Americans attempted to join or succeeded in joining jihadist movements in Syria and Iraq, according to a 2014 <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2191/f/TravelersAmericanJihadistsinSyriaandIraq.pdf\">report</a> by George Washington University&rsquo;s Program on Extremism. Dozens were arrested before they left the United States. <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/hagel-100-americans-have-joined-isis\">More than a hundred</a> ended up fighting with <em>ISIS</em>, according to Chuck Hagel, who was then the Defense Secretary. A <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/02/05/583407221/americans-in-isis-some-300-tried-to-join-12-have-returned-to-u-s\">few</a> rose to leadership positions. The Americans tended to fall into <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2191/f/TravelersAmericanJihadistsinSyriaandIraq.pdf\">three categories</a>: the early pioneers and ideologues who brought skills with them; the &ldquo;networked travelers&rdquo; who had personal connections with others in <em>ISIS</em>; and the loners, lured by propaganda, who made their own way to the Islamic State. When <em>ISIS</em> lost its last piece of territory, on March 23rd, fewer than two dozen Americans&mdash;fighters and family members&mdash;were found among the tens of thousands, U.S. officials told me. Sulejmani&rsquo;s family accounted for five of them. Many other Americans are presumed to have died, possibly in U.S. air strikes.</p>",

                "text": "A few days before the collapse of the Islamic State\u2019s caliphate, I visited one of the new \u201cpop-up prisons\u201d that had been hastily converted to hold thousands of surrendering ISIS fighters in Syria. The numbers wildly exceeded all expectations, including estimates by U.S. intelligence. The most striking sight at the prison entrance was a mound of human hair lying on the raw concrete floor. Clumps of it\u2014some brown, some graying, most of it greasy or matted\u2014had been shaved off the heads and faces of fighters before they were taken to group cells. \u201cLice,\u201d one of the guards told me.\nThe prison at Dashisha, in eastern Deir Ezzor province, had been an oil-storage facility. In just four days, the compound of modest brick and stucco buildings had been filled with fifteen hundred fighters from countries on four continents, including France, Libya, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Iraq, and the United States, the warden told me. Average-sized rooms had been fitted with metal doors; each cell had a small barred window that I had to stand on my tiptoes to peer through. Each one was crammed, wall to wall, with dozens of men squatting on the floor. The ISIS fighters wore new T-shirts, in army green, and whatever trousers they had on when they were captured.\nAfter five years of war with the Islamic State, the biggest problem for the winners is coping with the losers. The aftermath has produced one of the world\u2019s most perplexing postwar challenges: there are tens of thousands of captured ISIS members whom no nation wants to repatriate, and the local militia holding them has neither the resources nor the personnel to keep them indefinitely. More than five thousand ISIS fighters surrendered in the final month of fighting alone. Thousands more were captured earlier in the conflict. They\u2019re dispersed among the new pop-up prisons in northeast Syria. A few hundred of the most severely wounded are in a small hospital, with the foreign fighters crowded in its basement for security. The hospital stench was overwhelming, even through a mask. \u201cSepsis,\u201d a medic told me. Between December and March, another sixty-three thousand family members of ISIS fighters\u2014wives enveloped in black niqabs that cover their faces, and bedraggled young children\u2014also poured out of Baghouz, the last ISIS redoubt in Syria. They\u2019re held separately, most in tents, at a dusty, malodorous camp in al-Hawl that already held ten thousand. The prisons, the hospital, and the camp are all bursting.\n\u201cThere is nothing else in the world that compares to this unprecedented humanitarian and security situation, which is legally complicated and politically fraught,\u201d a senior State Department official told me. So far, the local Syrian Democratic Forces militia (S.D.F.), the U.S.-led coalition of more than seventy countries, and several international relief agencies have been improvising\u2014total ad-hockery, in the words of a senior U.S. military commander involved in Syria.\nJust sorting out the fighters\u2019 real names and nationalities has been messy. Many use noms de guerre. Few have identity papers or passports. Some don\u2019t want to reveal their identities\u2014or their roles with ISIS. I interviewed three of the prison\u2019s foreign detainees: a middle-aged misfit from Chicago, who was lured to Syria by ISIS propaganda; a Moroccan who, as an \u201cemir of morality,\u201d acknowledged witnessing at least ten stonings of women accused of adultery and the burning of some forty Yazidi women who were put in a cage, covered with fuel, and set on fire; and a lanky Turk with a prosthetic leg, which was his souvenir from a U.S. air strike. The Turk, Farouk Asser, insisted that he once worked at a pizza parlor in Istanbul and, after joining ISIS, merely worked as a cook and at a local police station. Every few sentences, the warden muttered, \u201cHe\u2019s a liar. He\u2019s a liar.\u201d Asser, according to the warden, was one of the early ISIS recruiters who helped foreign fighters cross the border from Turkey into Syria.\nThe pop-up prisons are combustible politically and vulnerable physically, a dozen U.S. diplomats and military officials told me. ISIS has its roots in an earlier prison culture\u2014notably in Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca, two infamous prisons in Iraq that were run by the United States between 2003 and 2011. Its founding \u201ccaliph,\u201d Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was held at Camp Bucca for nine months, in 2004. He and other future ISIS leaders created an embryonic network there.\nThe movement grew rapidly after Baghdadi pronounced, in 2012, that its first priority should be \u201creleasing Muslim prisoners everywhere, and chasing and eliminating judges and investigators and their guards.\u201d Over the next year, Al Qaeda in Iraq attacked eight prisons. In July, 2013, more than five hundred inmates\u2014including top Al Qaeda leaders sentenced to death\u2014were freed in final simultaneous attacks on two prisons, including Abu Ghraib. Many inmates escaped into Syria, where Al Qaeda in Iraq evolved into the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. The prison raids\u2014the so-called breaking-the-walls campaign\u2014provided the first evidence that Baghdadi\u2019s men were \u201ca professional military force capable of planning, training, resourcing and executing synchronized and complex attacks,\u201d as the Institute for the Study of War reported. By 2014, ISIS had enough men to blitz across Syria and Iraq, and captured territory the size of Britain. Despite its recent loss of terrain in both Syria and Iraq, U.S. military and S.D.F. officials told me, ISIS underground cells still have those basic capabilities. Prison breaks, they added, are almost certain to be one way that the group tries to rebuild.\nThe first prisoner I interviewed at Dashisha was Lirim Sulejmani, the American from Chicago. He had surrendered two weeks earlier. He was balding and thin; he told me that he was forty-three. His arms were awkwardly handcuffed behind him with thin plastic bands. He seemed detached, and both physically and psychologically defeated. We sat on the floor of the prison\u2019s makeshift office, which had no furniture. His wife and three children were probably at the al-Hawl camp, he said, but he wasn\u2019t sure. He was sucked into ISIS by its utopian promises. \u201cI wanted to make hegira,\u201d he told me. \u201cI wanted to live under Sharia,\u201d or Islamic law. Hegira, traditionally used to describe the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s migration from Mecca to Medina to escape persecution, had become an ISIS buzzword\u2014and a recruiting tool. The pull is as powerful as the idea of jihad. After Baghdadi declared the Islamic State, in 2014, he appealed to Muslims worldwide to make hegira, to re-create a country that ruled as in the Prophet\u2019s time, fourteen centuries ago.\nUp to three hundred Americans attempted to join or succeeded in joining jihadist movements in Syria and Iraq, according to a 2014 report by George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism. Dozens were arrested before they left the United States. More than a hundred ended up fighting with ISIS, according to Chuck Hagel, who was then the Defense Secretary. A few rose to leadership positions. The Americans tended to fall into three categories: the early pioneers and ideologues who brought skills with them; the \u201cnetworked travelers\u201d who had personal connections with others in ISIS; and the loners, lured by propaganda, who made their own way to the Islamic State. When ISIS lost its last piece of territory, on March 23rd, fewer than two dozen Americans\u2014fighters and family members\u2014were found among the tens of thousands, U.S. officials told me. Sulejmani\u2019s family accounted for five of them. Many other Americans are presumed to have died, possibly in U.S. air strikes.",

The claim related to the kiss may prove difficult to verify. Four people said that the campaign worker, Alva Johnson, told them about the incident afterward, but two other people, who Johnson said were present at the time of the kiss, told me that they did not see it. In a statement, Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, denied that it had taken place.</p>\n<p>The most legally significant aspect of Johnson&rsquo;s suit may ultimately be something the complaint does not explicitly address: the pervasive use of nondisclosure agreements by Trump during his campaign and in his Administration. Johnson&rsquo;s suit is at least the sixth legal case in which Trump campaign or Administration employees have defied their nondisclosure agreements. Three of those actions, including Johnson&rsquo;s, were filed this month. Johnson, who was the campaign&rsquo;s administrative field-operations director in Florida, signed a nondisclosure agreement that bars her from revealing any information &ldquo;in any way detrimental to the Company, Mr. Trump, any Family Member, any Trump Company or any Family Member company.&rdquo; Johnson&rsquo;s attorney, Hassan Zavareei, said, &ldquo;We expect that Trump will try to use the unconscionable N.D.A. and forced arbitration agreement to silence Ms. Johnson. We will fight this strong-arm tactic.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The White House referred questions about the nondisclosure agreements to Michael Glassner, the chief operating officer of Trump&rsquo;s re&euml;lection campaign. He said in a statement, &ldquo;The campaign takes our NDA agreements very seriously, and will enforce them aggressively if they are breached.&rdquo; Johnson said that she considers the issues raised by her suit important enough to merit breaching the contract. &ldquo;I am suing because my work holds the same value as the work of my white male counterparts,&rdquo; Johnson said, in an interview. &ldquo;I am suing because this predatory behavior should not be minimized, especially when committed by the most powerful man in the world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Nondisclosure agreements are routinely employed in the business world, but experts say that there is little comprehensive data on how they are used by Presidential campaigns. Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s 2016 campaign <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/03/22/memo-to-white-house-staff-keep-talking\">reportedly</a> required paid staff to sign such agreements, but Trump&rsquo;s campaign seemed to use the agreements more widely, and even required unpaid volunteers to sign them. The practice has carried over to the Trump White House. The Washington <em>Post</em> <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/everyone-signed-one-trump-is-aggressive-in-his-use-of-nondisclosure-agreements-even-in-government/2018/08/13/9d0315ba-9f15-11e8-93e3-24d1703d2a7a_story.html?utm_term=.b17b00786ee1\">reported</a> last year that dozens of White House aides had signed N.D.A.s, a break in tradition from previous Administrations, which used the contracts more sparingly. White House interns have also <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-white-house-is-forcing-interns-to-sign-ndas-and-threatening-them-with-financial-ruin\">reportedly</a> been asked to sign the agreements as part of their mandatory &ldquo;ethics training.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Two former Trump advisers who had senior roles in the campaign said that workers were pressured into signing such agreements. Internal e-mails received by one of the former advisers repeatedly insist that &ldquo;we must have that NDA.&rdquo; The second adviser told me that Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager, &ldquo;was tasked by Mr. Trump to insure that anyone and everyone working with the campaign, whether salaried employee, volunteer, surrogate, or otherwise, execute a nondisclosure agreement or they would be terminated immediately. They strong-armed people to sign.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The first adviser, who went on to hold a position in the White House, recalled that Stefan Passantino, the deputy White House counsel in charge of overseeing ethics, personally demanded a signature on an N.D.A. &ldquo;They would not allow me to take the document off campus, would not allow me to e-mail the document to my attorneys. That&rsquo;s where the red flags started,&rdquo; the adviser told me. The adviser declined to sign, and felt that the decision had a negative impact on the adviser&rsquo;s standing in the Administration. (Passantino did not respond to a request for comment.) A third former campaign official called the reports of workers being pressured to sign the agreements exaggerated. He said that staffers who declined to sign were not terminated, and noted that there were &ldquo;always concerns&rdquo; within the campaign about the enforceability of the agreements.</p>\n<p>Johnson&rsquo;s lawsuit will almost certainly face intense scrutiny, both because of her claims and because of the nature of the incident at the heart of the lawsuit. The complaint acknowledges that &ldquo;forcible kissing might appear at first glance to be on the lesser extreme&rdquo; of misconduct, but it argues that the interaction meets common-law definitions of battery, a legal term referring to harmful or offensive contact.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit says that Johnson joined the Trump campaign in January, 2016, as the director of outreach and coalitions in Alabama, and that she held various positions in the ensuing months, eventually working as the administrative field-operations director in Florida. Johnson, who is African-American, asserts in her lawsuit that she was paid &ldquo;substantially less&rdquo; than other staff members with similar responsibilities because of her race and gender, and that campaign staffers made comments about race that made her uncomfortable. (One of those staffers disputed Johnson&rsquo;s account, accusing her of having an &ldquo;agenda.&rdquo;) An analysis by the <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/06/04/donald-trump-campaign-pays-women-less-than-men/VIu0v2MUJiHqhvc5C0W5dO/story.html\">Boston <em>Globe</em></a> in June, 2016, found that female staffers on the Trump campaign were paid, on average, three-quarters what their male counterparts received.</p>\n<p>The incident in which Johnson said that Trump kissed her occurred during an event that she had helped organize in Tampa in August, 2016, according to the complaint. In an R.V. before Trump&rsquo;s speech at the event, the complaint alleges, Trump took Johnson by the hand and leaned in to kiss her; she attempted to turn away, but, she claims, his mouth made contact with the corner of hers.</p>\n<figure><figure> <video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5dfb972634e7945990dec215/e4c62a19-5bfb-4fd1-ba95-8421dc1c4087high.mp4?videoIndex=0&requester=oo\"><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video><iframe src=\"https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.365.1_en.html#goog_2130527875\"></iframe><video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5dfb972634e7945990dec215/e4c62a19-5bfb-4fd1-ba95-8421dc1c4087thumbs.mp4\"></video> WATCH President Trump Is Impeached Share Tweet Email More... <h4>EMBED URL</h4>&lt;script async src=&quot;//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5dfb972634e7945990dec215.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<h4>VIDEO URL</h4>https://video.newyorker.com/watch/president-trump-is-impeached/<h4>Our bad!

She said that she took several sick days and consulted an attorney, whom she told in a text message that Trump had kissed her. She also spoke with a therapist, whose notes state that &ldquo;she was having nightmares because of what happened.&rdquo; The attorney, Adam Horowitz, advised Johnson to notify the campaign that she was resigning.

                "text": "A staff member of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 Presidential campaign filed a lawsuit in federal court in Florida on Monday, alleging that she experienced \u201cracial and gender discrimination\u201d while working for the campaign, that she was paid less than male and white colleagues, and that Trump once kissed her partially on the mouth, without her consent. The claim related to the kiss may prove difficult to verify. Four people said that the campaign worker, Alva Johnson, told them about the incident afterward, but two other people, who Johnson said were present at the time of the kiss, told me that they did not see it. In a statement, Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, denied that it had taken place.\nThe most legally significant aspect of Johnson\u2019s suit may ultimately be something the complaint does not explicitly address: the pervasive use of nondisclosure agreements by Trump during his campaign and in his Administration. Johnson\u2019s suit is at least the sixth legal case in which Trump campaign or Administration employees have defied their nondisclosure agreements. Three of those actions, including Johnson\u2019s, were filed this month. Johnson, who was the campaign\u2019s administrative field-operations director in Florida, signed a nondisclosure agreement that bars her from revealing any information \u201cin any way detrimental to the Company, Mr. Trump, any Family Member, any Trump Company or any Family Member company.\u201d Johnson\u2019s attorney, Hassan Zavareei, said, \u201cWe expect that Trump will try to use the unconscionable N.D.A. and forced arbitration agreement to silence Ms. Johnson. We will fight this strong-arm tactic.\u201d\nThe White House referred questions about the nondisclosure agreements to Michael Glassner, the chief operating officer of Trump\u2019s re\u00eblection campaign. He said in a statement, \u201cThe campaign takes our NDA agreements very seriously, and will enforce them aggressively if they are breached.\u201d Johnson said that she considers the issues raised by her suit important enough to merit breaching the contract. \u201cI am suing because my work holds the same value as the work of my white male counterparts,\u201d Johnson said, in an interview. \u201cI am suing because this predatory behavior should not be minimized, especially when committed by the most powerful man in the world.\u201d\nNondisclosure agreements are routinely employed in the business world, but experts say that there is little comprehensive data on how they are used by Presidential campaigns. Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign reportedly required paid staff to sign such agreements, but Trump\u2019s campaign seemed to use the agreements more widely, and even required unpaid volunteers to sign them. The practice has carried over to the Trump White House. The Washington Post reported last year that dozens of White House aides had signed N.D.A.s, a break in tradition from previous Administrations, which used the contracts more sparingly. White House interns have also reportedly been asked to sign the agreements as part of their mandatory \u201cethics training.\u201d\nTwo former Trump advisers who had senior roles in the campaign said that workers were pressured into signing such agreements. Internal e-mails received by one of the former advisers repeatedly insist that \u201cwe must have that NDA.\u201d The second adviser told me that Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager, \u201cwas tasked by Mr. Trump to insure that anyone and everyone working with the campaign, whether salaried employee, volunteer, surrogate, or otherwise, execute a nondisclosure agreement or they would be terminated immediately. They strong-armed people to sign.\u201d\nThe first adviser, who went on to hold a position in the White House, recalled that Stefan Passantino, the deputy White House counsel in charge of overseeing ethics, personally demanded a signature on an N.D.A. \u201cThey would not allow me to take the document off campus, would not allow me to e-mail the document to my attorneys. That\u2019s where the red flags started,\u201d the adviser told me. The adviser declined to sign, and felt that the decision had a negative impact on the adviser\u2019s standing in the Administration. (Passantino did not respond to a request for comment.) A third former campaign official called the reports of workers being pressured to sign the agreements exaggerated. He said that staffers who declined to sign were not terminated, and noted that there were \u201calways concerns\u201d within the campaign about the enforceability of the agreements.\nJohnson\u2019s lawsuit will almost certainly face intense scrutiny, both because of her claims and because of the nature of the incident at the heart of the lawsuit. The complaint acknowledges that \u201cforcible kissing might appear at first glance to be on the lesser extreme\u201d of misconduct, but it argues that the interaction meets common-law definitions of battery, a legal term referring to harmful or offensive contact.\nThe lawsuit says that Johnson joined the Trump campaign in January, 2016, as the director of outreach and coalitions in Alabama, and that she held various positions in the ensuing months, eventually working as the administrative field-operations director in Florida. Johnson, who is African-American, asserts in her lawsuit that she was paid \u201csubstantially less\u201d than other staff members with similar responsibilities because of her race and gender, and that campaign staffers made comments about race that made her uncomfortable. (One of those staffers disputed Johnson\u2019s account, accusing her of having an \u201cagenda.\u201d) An analysis by the Boston Globe in June, 2016, found that female staffers on the Trump campaign were paid, on average, three-quarters what their male counterparts received.\nThe incident in which Johnson said that Trump kissed her occurred during an event that she had helped organize in Tampa in August, 2016, according to the complaint. In an R.V. before Trump\u2019s speech at the event, the complaint alleges, Trump took Johnson by the hand and leaned in to kiss her; she attempted to turn away, but, she claims, his mouth made contact with the corner of hers.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH President Trump Is Impeached Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5dfb972634e7945990dec215.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://video.newyorker.com/watch/president-trump-is-impeached/\nOur bad!

I don\u2019t even wait.\u201d At that point, Johnson said, she saw the incident with Trump as part of a pattern. She said that she took several sick days and consulted an attorney, whom she told in a text message that Trump had kissed her. She also spoke with a therapist, whose notes state that \u201cshe was having nightmares because of what happened.\u201d The attorney, Adam Horowitz, advised Johnson to notify the campaign that she was resigning. Shortly afterward, the campaign sent Johnson a termination letter.",

In diplomatic-speak, it is defined as &ldquo;complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization&rdquo; or &ldquo;C.V.I.D.&rdquo; That includes destroying all stockpiles, dismantling all production sites, conducting intrusive and ongoing inspections, ending proliferation by sharing technology or weapons with other countries, and abandoning any research facilities that might give Pyongyang a future capacity.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Chances that North Koreans will give up their stockpiles are slim,&rdquo; Bill Richardson, the former U.N. Ambassador, who has made several trips to negotiate with Pyongyang, told me. &ldquo;So we need to be clear about what denuclearization means.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>North Korea has nuclear weapons largely because it took Eisenhower&rsquo;s warning seriously&mdash;and has had a deep-seated fear of the American nuclear capacity ever since. After Eisenhower took office, with help from the Soviet Union, North Korea <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://secure-web.cisco.com/1PCQMNYYF0qQDZlQa5jEuv87JkzMeeDI6QOh-o5cLyYtWLopnhG56GDsj_ooB3fUssL4kZ4wkeJyBFHbtwIm7QBArxmqma5BbUGmaYfblDBho7CwF44ZshIX3FW4PRHaXTKQmp0dAPJgvTYix535BheJuLfmCGLcfneWmSWFvfwh_9mADOSp9hZb-2rzgVs1BQIkE2JwCyefV0IxCdHU8EYjjvm_djGBkkc3I6hYLVB-66779dvDhuJ5w9WMjTX_VjFJRBTUjPOds-bmtMzu5epJfFR7t-HcW1jsT19ygkp57WWvml-NjUB99wqbWnyU3H42TQso-G4fZscjKWY0iNApwvpQpcHz0juXPxm9gSx-HWo9guQIHaG798i6KWfep/https%3A%2F%2Fbeyondparallel.csis.org%2Fyongbyon-declassified-part-i%2F\">began</a> building a nuclear program to <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"http://secure-web.cisco.com/1z4oUoo4-QdYLEaj7EenTe9q2pXp2Osi9wdC_GTF6MOd_yf4t9wlvgvEzlrj4uQ-JJwty5e2ZPLtj26bXAmFUEXTO6WEcS9mch7o8BcenFziC2VqPBvbdA1uxY5Toz7kLpXIIy1RcFzCYAJ8B9BRX7UQGQAnzkqvqzkCO-IUsdXh0hm-kGQIW-1w6p-axURqqXdwt7m_kl1Y_CISnxv7zP4dQ0IH6cr4DcT30FJpzwbcO19__vnZ_pvG7LZYLDlOvX1JrX66Y9ESTp5v1pm21FFqE8oBKnHaaXOHmoCPHijP0ZDjM890XKvoovtI_WmjtGGteiTOBxYsutPXJGhmsTAlde3EmSQYpuZV1p5fYOl_XmOmj-K7G103mqF-isjQS/http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F4692045%2Fnorth-korea-nuclear-weapons-history%2F\">deter</a> a future U.S. attack.

And, at the White House briefing, two senior Administration officials were adamant that the withdrawal of U.S forces from South Korea was not currently on the table.</p>\n<p>The White House insists, though, that Trump wants a breakthrough in Hanoi. &ldquo;We actually need to move very quickly in this process, and I think we need to move in very big bites,&rdquo; the senior Administration official said at the briefing. &ldquo;So we are not looking to have incremental steps.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The hope, however elusive, is that the summit will at least produce a roadmap &ldquo;with milestones for verifiable denuclearization in tandem with progress on the other three goals,&rdquo; Vershbow told me. Kimball said that the most tangible and attainable interim steps would be &ldquo;the verifiable decommissioning of the Yongbyon nuclear complex, where the bulk of North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear-weapons material-production infrastructure is located, in exchange for a political declaration on the end of the war, with perhaps limited sanctions relief that would facilitate North-South tourism and trade co&ouml;peration.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Richardson said that the Hanoi summit, to be considered successful, will have to produce what the Singapore summit failed to achieve: &ldquo;a signed framework for negotiations&mdash;timelines, terms of reference, and routine schedule of summits. Short of that, negotiations will fizzle again until the next summit is announced.&rdquo; To get a deal, Richardson added, the President may need to set up additional meetings with Kim &ldquo;every three to four months.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On Sunday, Pompeo hinted that Trump might be willing to extend his stay in Hanoi if needed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident that if it requires even more time, we&rsquo;ll commit to that,&rdquo; he said on &ldquo;Fox News Sunday.&rdquo; The summit, currently scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, now includes a one-on-one session between the two leaders, a working lunch, and expanded meetings with their teams.</p>\n<p>In the end, Klingner said, the principal determinant will be &ldquo;how far the President moves away from previous firm stances in his eagerness for an agreement. At this point, the U.S. position is in greater flux than that of North Korea.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "General Dwight Eisenhower, a strategic mastermind who commanded three million troops during the Second World War, won the Presidency, in 1952, largely because of his dramatic pledge to end the gruelling Korean War. He vowed to personally visit the Korean Peninsula, where tens of thousands of Americans had died in the conflict, before taking office. After he won, he did. The problem, as Eisenhower discovered within a month of moving into the White House, was how to achieve that peace. Fighting was at a stalemate; two years of peace talks were going nowhere. In frustration, Eisenhower decided, in May, 1953, that \u201cit might be cheaper, dollarwise, to use atomic weapons in Korea than to continue to use conventional weapons against the dugouts which honeycombed the hills\u201d where North Korean troops were deployed, according to declassified records of National Security Council meetings. Eisenhower then transmitted a secret warning to North Korea\u2014as well as to China\u2014that the United States was prepared to use the bomb if they didn\u2019t return to peace talks.\nThey did. The negotiations proved to be the longest armistice talks in history. In the end, however, the three parties\u2014North Korea and China on one side, the U.S.-led United Nations Command on the other\u2014agreed only to a truce. Eleven American Presidents later, Donald Trump faces the challenge of brokering a formal peace when he sits down this week, in Hanoi, for his second summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But, this time, North Korea is no longer a war-ravaged young nation with limited military resources.\nThe task for Trump, who has limited diplomatic acumen, is to generate progress on all four goals outlined in the vague two-page joint statement that came out of the first Trump-Kim summit, in June, in Singapore. The first goal is bettering relations. The second is \u201ca lasting and stable\u201d peace to end the Korean War. Coming in third, notably, is denuclearization. The fourth is the recovery and return of the remains of more than five thousand Americans missing in action from the war.\nTrump\u2019s own spy chiefs don\u2019t seem optimistic. \u201cWe continue to observe activity inconsistent with full denuclearization,\u201d the intelligence community\u2019s new Worldwide Threat Assessment concluded last month. \u201cThe regime is committed to developing a long-range nuclear-armed missile that would pose a direct threat to the United States,\u201d Gina Haspel, the director of the C.I.A., said in a briefing on the assessment for the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nOver the past year, Pyongyang has produced enough new fuel to add seven bombs to its nuclear arsenal, Stanford University\u2019s Center for International Security and Co\u00f6peration reported last month. It already had between thirty and sixty bombs. In 2018, it issued an order to mass-produce nuclear weapons.\nNo tangible diplomatic progress has been made since the meeting in Singapore. The momentum in behind-the-scenes talks stalled until a few weeks ago, U.S. officials told me. Despite its pledges, North Korea has not provided a full list of its arsenal, which has been a major goal of U.S. diplomacy, for three decades, under five Presidents. U.S. intelligence believes that the North has several covert facilities, some buried deep in mountain tunnels, that have not been identified\u2014and that Pyongyang may be reluctant to disclose.\nA senior Administration official involved in the diplomacy acknowledged the uncertainties at a White House press briefing this past Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t know if North Korea has made the choice yet to denuclearize,\u201d he said.\nSince Singapore, though, Trump has repeatedly gushed about his chemistry with Kim and their exchange of \u201cbeautiful\u201d letters. \u201cWe fell in love,\u201d he pronounced, in September. But lately, the President has tried to dampen expectations of an imminent breakthrough. Last week, Trump said he was in \u201cno rush\u201d to reach a deal.\nIn Washington, skepticism is widespread among Republicans and Democrats in Congress, as well as from experts on the region. \u201cI\u2019m pessimistic because Trump keeps undercutting his negotiators and his own leverage with his \u2018no rush\u2019 rhetoric and his insistence that the suspension of testing is all that matters,\u201d Alexander (Sandy) Vershbow, a former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea and Assistant Secretary of Defense, told me. \u201cSo the North Koreans keep producing fissile material, manufacture more bombs and ballistic missiles to point at us, South Korea, and Japan, and become recognized de facto as a nuclear-weapons state, while Trump oversells his meagre achievements, as he did at Singapore,\u201d he said.\nEight months after the first summit, the two countries have not even defined what \u201cdenuclearization\u201d means. They\u2019re \u201cstill at the starting point of the lengthy and arduous process,\u201d Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, in Washington, told me. \u201cTrump cannot afford to squander the time spent getting to this point and come away with just pictures and pleasantries with Kim. This summit can and must emphasize substance over pageantry.\u201d\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH President Trump Is Impeached Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5dfb972634e7945990dec215.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://video.newyorker.com/watch/president-trump-is-impeached/\nOur bad!

In diplomatic-speak, it is defined as \u201ccomplete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization\u201d or \u201cC.V.I.D.\u201d That includes destroying all stockpiles, dismantling all production sites, conducting intrusive and ongoing inspections, ending proliferation by sharing technology or weapons with other countries, and abandoning any research facilities that might give Pyongyang a future capacity.\n\u201cChances that North Koreans will give up their stockpiles are slim,\u201d Bill Richardson, the former U.N. Ambassador, who has made several trips to negotiate with Pyongyang, told me. \u201cSo we need to be clear about what denuclearization means.\u201d\nNorth Korea has nuclear weapons largely because it took Eisenhower\u2019s warning seriously\u2014and has had a deep-seated fear of the American nuclear capacity ever since. After Eisenhower took office, with help from the Soviet Union, North Korea began building a nuclear program to deter a future U.S. attack. The bomb has become the insurance that the Kim dynasty, now in its third generation, will survive. For North Korea, denuclearization means that the United States pledges not to use military force against the North, ends the war, lifts punitive economic sanctions, and withdraws its nearly thirty-thousand forces from South Korea.\nThe gap remains wide on all four issues. \u201cIn December, Pyongyang directly rebuked [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo for claiming that the regime had accepted the C.V.I.D. concept,\u201d Klingner told me. And, at the White House briefing, two senior Administration officials were adamant that the withdrawal of U.S forces from South Korea was not currently on the table.\nThe White House insists, though, that Trump wants a breakthrough in Hanoi. \u201cWe actually need to move very quickly in this process, and I think we need to move in very big bites,\u201d the senior Administration official said at the briefing. \u201cSo we are not looking to have incremental steps.\u201d\nThe hope, however elusive, is that the summit will at least produce a roadmap \u201cwith milestones for verifiable denuclearization in tandem with progress on the other three goals,\u201d Vershbow told me. Kimball said that the most tangible and attainable interim steps would be \u201cthe verifiable decommissioning of the Yongbyon nuclear complex, where the bulk of North Korea\u2019s nuclear-weapons material-production infrastructure is located, in exchange for a political declaration on the end of the war, with perhaps limited sanctions relief that would facilitate North-South tourism and trade co\u00f6peration.\u201d\nRichardson said that the Hanoi summit, to be considered successful, will have to produce what the Singapore summit failed to achieve: \u201ca signed framework for negotiations\u2014timelines, terms of reference, and routine schedule of summits. Short of that, negotiations will fizzle again until the next summit is announced.\u201d To get a deal, Richardson added, the President may need to set up additional meetings with Kim \u201cevery three to four months.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Pompeo hinted that Trump might be willing to extend his stay in Hanoi if needed. \u201cI\u2019m confident that if it requires even more time, we\u2019ll commit to that,\u201d he said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d The summit, currently scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, now includes a one-on-one session between the two leaders, a working lunch, and expanded meetings with their teams.\nIn the end, Klingner said, the principal determinant will be \u201chow far the President moves away from previous firm stances in his eagerness for an agreement. At this point, the U.S. position is in greater flux than that of North Korea.\u201d",

On Sunday, a spokesperson for Ethiopia&rsquo;s ministry of transport <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ethiopian-official-black-box-data-shows-clear-similarity-between-ethiopian-airlines-lion-air-crashes/2019/03/17/92573222-48d4-11e9-8cfc-2c5d0999c21e_story.html?utm_term=.e5571da9cb25\">said</a> that the black box that was recovered from the wreckage of Flight 302 indicated that &ldquo;clear similarities were noted between Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610,&rdquo; which crashed last October, killing a hundred and eighty-nine people.</p>\n<p>The plane involved in the Lion Air tragedy was also a Boeing 737 Max 8, and investigators suspect that the cause of that crash was a malfunctioning automated-flight-control feature, which caused the aircraft&rsquo;s nose to dip repeatedly during its initial ascent out of the airport in Jakarta. The automated-flight-control feature on the 737 Max, which is called a Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (<em>MCAS</em>), was designed to prevent a high-speed stall. It works by tilting part of the horizontal stabilizer in the tail of the plane, and investigators at the Ethiopian crash site have found physical <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/french-start-analysis-ethiopian-airlines-black-boxes-as-new-evidence-appears/2019/03/15/87770e8c-468f-11e9-94ab-d2dda3c0df52_story.html?utm_term=.4538c946fdc5\">evidence</a> that this part of the plane was, indeed, configured to dive.</p>\n<p>Radar data has indicated that both planes jerked up and down in erratic fashion after takeoff. The captain of the Ethiopian Airlines flight <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/world/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-airlines.html\">reported</a> a &ldquo;flight control&rdquo; problem to the air-traffic control tower. Data from the black box of the Lion Air plane showed that its pilots repeatedly pulled back on the control yoke to try to disengage the <em>MCAS</em> and level the flight path of the plane. &ldquo;The pilots fought continuously until the end of the flight,&rdquo; an official from the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/world/asia/indonesia-lion-air-crash-.html\">said</a> in November, after the plane&rsquo;s black box was recovered.</p>\n<p>This is all frightening enough, and it raises serious questions about why Boeing didn&rsquo;t tell airlines and pilots much more about the <em>MCAS</em>&mdash;in particular, how to disengage it in an emergency&mdash;before the 737 Max was put into <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.nola.com/business/2019/03/at-tense-meeting-with-boeing-pilots-angry-about-company-not-disclosing-737s-software.html\">service</a>, in 2017. Boeing has delivered three hundred and seventy-six of these planes to airlines around the world. Practically all of them have now been grounded out of safety concerns.</p>\n<p>Boeing has promised a software fix to address some of the potential problems created by the <em>MCAS</em>. That&rsquo;s too little, too late, of course, and it doesn&rsquo;t address the even larger issue of how the 737 Max was allowed to fly in the first place. On Sunday, the Seattle <em>Times</em>, the home-town newspaper of Boeing&rsquo;s commercial division, published the results of a lengthy investigation into the federal certification of the 737 Max. It found that the F.A.A. outsourced key elements of the certification process to Boeing itself, and that Boeing&rsquo;s safety analysis of the new plane contained some serious flaws, including several relating to the <em>MCAS</em>.</p>\n<p>The Boeing analysis &ldquo;understated the power of the new flight control system,&rdquo; the Seattle <em>Times</em> article <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/failed-certification-faa-missed-safety-issues-in-the-737-max-system-implicated-in-the-lion-air-crash/\">said</a>. &ldquo;When the planes later entered service, <em>MCAS</em> was capable of moving the tail more than four times farther than was stated in the initial safety analysis document.&rdquo; The Boeing analysis also &ldquo;failed to account for how the system could reset itself each time a pilot responded, thereby missing the potential impact of the system repeatedly pushing the airplane&rsquo;s nose downward.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the case of the Lion Air flight, investigators suspect the <em>MCAS</em> was reacting to faulty data gathered from a single flight sensor mounted on the fuselage. According to the Seattle <em>Times</em> article, the Boeing analysis assessed the failure of the <em>MCAS</em> system as &ldquo;as one level below &lsquo;catastrophic.&rsquo; But even that &lsquo;hazardous&rsquo; danger level should have precluded activation of the system based on input from a single sensor&mdash;and yet that&rsquo;s how it was designed.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><figure> <video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5d7967ef34e7944879ab6f9d/0087691f-c43c-458a-b548-97a9d4aa2970high.mp4?videoIndex=0&requester=oo\"><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video><iframe src=\"https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.365.1_en.html#goog_163721431\"></iframe><video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5d7967ef34e7944879ab6f9d/0087691f-c43c-458a-b548-97a9d4aa2970thumbs.mp4\"></video> WATCH Throwing Shade Through Crosswords Share Tweet Email More... <h4>EMBED URL</h4>&lt;script async src=&quot;//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5d7967ef34e7944879ab6f9d.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<h4>VIDEO URL</h4>https://video.newyorker.com/watch/throwing-shade-through-crosswords/<h4>Our bad!

It turns out that the F.A.A., with congressional approval, has &ldquo;over the years delegated increasing authority to Boeing to take on more of the work of certifying the safety of its own airplanes,&rdquo; the Seattle <em>Times</em> said. In the case of the 737 Max, which is a longer and more fuel-efficient version of previous 737s, Boeing was particularly eager to get the plane into service quickly, so it could compete with Airbus&rsquo;s new A320neo.</p>\n<p>Early on, employees of the F.A.A. and Boeing decided how to divide up the certification work. But, partway through the process, a former F.A.A. safety engineer told the Seattle <em>Times</em>, &ldquo;we were asked by management to re-evaluate what would be delegated. Management thought we had retained too much at the FAA.&rdquo; The engineer said that &ldquo;there was constant pressure to re-evaluate our initial decisions,&rdquo; and &ldquo;even after we had reassessed it &hellip; there was continued discussion by management about delegating even more items down to the Boeing Company.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Even the work that was retained, such as reviewing technical documents provided by Boeing, was sometimes curtailed. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t a complete and proper review of the documents,&rdquo; the former engineer added. &ldquo;Review was rushed to reach certain certification dates.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The new revelations don&rsquo;t stop there. &ldquo;Federal prosecutors and Department of Transportation officials are scrutinizing the development of Boeing Co.&rsquo;s 737 MAX jetliners,&rdquo; the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/faas-737-max-approval-is-probed-11552868400\">reported</a> on Monday. &ldquo;A grand jury in Washington, D.C., issued a broad subpoena dated March 11 to at least one person involved in the 737 MAX&rsquo;s development, seeking related documents, including correspondence, emails and other messages,&rdquo; a source told the paper. (The Justice Department and Department of Transportation declined to comment on the <em>Journal&rsquo;s</em> reporting.)</p>\n<p>The criminal investigation began well before the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight. It&rsquo;s not clear yet whether it is focussing on the <em>MCAS</em> system, the report in the <em>Journal</em> said. But, that article added, &ldquo;In the U.S., it is highly unusual for federal prosecutors to investigate details of regulatory approval of commercial aircraft designs, or to use a criminal probe to delve into dealings between the FAA and the largest aircraft manufacturer the agency oversees. Probes of airliner programs or alleged lapses in federal safety oversight typically are handled as civil cases, often by the DOT inspector general.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In a statement to the Seattle <em>Times</em>, Boeing said that the F.A.A. &ldquo;considered the final configuration and operating parameters of MCAS during MAX certification, and concluded that it met all certification and regulatory requirements.&rdquo; The F.A.A., in a statement issued on Sunday, <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/probe-of-faas-oversight-of-boeing-737-began-before-second-crash/\">said</a> that the &ldquo;737 MAX certification program followed the FAA&rsquo;s standard certification process.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Given that two brand-new 737 Maxes have plunged to earth, befuddling their pilots and costing three hundred and forty-six people their lives, these statements are hardly reassuring. We need to know a lot more about how the F.A.A. allowed this plane to take to the air.</p>",

                "text": "With virtually every day that has passed since the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which killed a hundred and fifty-seven people, more disturbing news has emerged. On Sunday, a spokesperson for Ethiopia\u2019s ministry of transport said that the black box that was recovered from the wreckage of Flight 302 indicated that \u201cclear similarities were noted between Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610,\u201d which crashed last October, killing a hundred and eighty-nine people.\nThe plane involved in the Lion Air tragedy was also a Boeing 737 Max 8, and investigators suspect that the cause of that crash was a malfunctioning automated-flight-control feature, which caused the aircraft\u2019s nose to dip repeatedly during its initial ascent out of the airport in Jakarta. The automated-flight-control feature on the 737 Max, which is called a Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was designed to prevent a high-speed stall. It works by tilting part of the horizontal stabilizer in the tail of the plane, and investigators at the Ethiopian crash site have found physical evidence that this part of the plane was, indeed, configured to dive.\nRadar data has indicated that both planes jerked up and down in erratic fashion after takeoff. The captain of the Ethiopian Airlines flight reported a \u201cflight control\u201d problem to the air-traffic control tower. Data from the black box of the Lion Air plane showed that its pilots repeatedly pulled back on the control yoke to try to disengage the MCAS and level the flight path of the plane. \u201cThe pilots fought continuously until the end of the flight,\u201d an official from the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee said in November, after the plane\u2019s black box was recovered.\nThis is all frightening enough, and it raises serious questions about why Boeing didn\u2019t tell airlines and pilots much more about the MCAS\u2014in particular, how to disengage it in an emergency\u2014before the 737 Max was put into service, in 2017. Boeing has delivered three hundred and seventy-six of these planes to airlines around the world. Practically all of them have now been grounded out of safety concerns.\nBoeing has promised a software fix to address some of the potential problems created by the MCAS. That\u2019s too little, too late, of course, and it doesn\u2019t address the even larger issue of how the 737 Max was allowed to fly in the first place. On Sunday, the Seattle Times, the home-town newspaper of Boeing\u2019s commercial division, published the results of a lengthy investigation into the federal certification of the 737 Max. It found that the F.A.A. outsourced key elements of the certification process to Boeing itself, and that Boeing\u2019s safety analysis of the new plane contained some serious flaws, including several relating to the MCAS.\nThe Boeing analysis \u201cunderstated the power of the new flight control system,\u201d the Seattle Times article said. \u201cWhen the planes later entered service, MCAS was capable of moving the tail more than four times farther than was stated in the initial safety analysis document.\u201d The Boeing analysis also \u201cfailed to account for how the system could reset itself each time a pilot responded, thereby missing the potential impact of the system repeatedly pushing the airplane\u2019s nose downward.\u201d\nIn the case of the Lion Air flight, investigators suspect the MCAS was reacting to faulty data gathered from a single flight sensor mounted on the fuselage. According to the Seattle Times article, the Boeing analysis assessed the failure of the MCAS system as \u201cas one level below \u2018catastrophic.\u2019 But even that \u2018hazardous\u2019 danger level should have precluded activation of the system based on input from a single sensor\u2014and yet that\u2019s how it was designed.\u201d\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH Throwing Shade Through Crosswords Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5d7967ef34e7944879ab6f9d.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://video.newyorker.com/watch/throwing-shade-through-crosswords/\nOur bad!

It turns out that the F.A.A., with congressional approval, has \u201cover the years delegated increasing authority to Boeing to take on more of the work of certifying the safety of its own airplanes,\u201d the Seattle Times said. In the case of the 737 Max, which is a longer and more fuel-efficient version of previous 737s, Boeing was particularly eager to get the plane into service quickly, so it could compete with Airbus\u2019s new A320neo.\nEarly on, employees of the F.A.A. and Boeing decided how to divide up the certification work. But, partway through the process, a former F.A.A. safety engineer told the Seattle Times, \u201cwe were asked by management to re-evaluate what would be delegated. Management thought we had retained too much at the FAA.\u201d The engineer said that \u201cthere was constant pressure to re-evaluate our initial decisions,\u201d and \u201ceven after we had reassessed it \u2026 there was continued discussion by management about delegating even more items down to the Boeing Company.\u201d\nEven the work that was retained, such as reviewing technical documents provided by Boeing, was sometimes curtailed. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a complete and proper review of the documents,\u201d the former engineer added. \u201cReview was rushed to reach certain certification dates.\u201d\nThe new revelations don\u2019t stop there. \u201cFederal prosecutors and Department of Transportation officials are scrutinizing the development of Boeing Co.\u2019s 737 MAX jetliners,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. \u201cA grand jury in Washington, D.C., issued a broad subpoena dated March 11 to at least one person involved in the 737 MAX\u2019s development, seeking related documents, including correspondence, emails and other messages,\u201d a source told the paper. (The Justice Department and Department of Transportation declined to comment on the Journal\u2019s reporting.)\nThe criminal investigation began well before the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight. It\u2019s not clear yet whether it is focussing on the MCAS system, the report in the Journal said. But, that article added, \u201cIn the U.S., it is highly unusual for federal prosecutors to investigate details of regulatory approval of commercial aircraft designs, or to use a criminal probe to delve into dealings between the FAA and the largest aircraft manufacturer the agency oversees. Probes of airliner programs or alleged lapses in federal safety oversight typically are handled as civil cases, often by the DOT inspector general.\u201d\nIn a statement to the Seattle Times, Boeing said that the F.A.A. \u201cconsidered the final configuration and operating parameters of MCAS during MAX certification, and concluded that it met all certification and regulatory requirements.\u201d The F.A.A., in a statement issued on Sunday, said that the \u201c737 MAX certification program followed the FAA\u2019s standard certification process.\u201d\nGiven that two brand-new 737 Maxes have plunged to earth, befuddling their pilots and costing three hundred and forty-six people their lives, these statements are hardly reassuring. We need to know a lot more about how the F.A.A. allowed this plane to take to the air.",

An intervention finally came earlier this month, when the former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli&aacute;n Castro, a candidate running near the bottom of the pack, unveiled the first detailed immigration platform of the 2020 campaign. Not only is Castro calling for a reversal of Trump&rsquo;s Muslim ban and wall spending; he also wants to decriminalize of the very act of crossing the border illegally, by repealing 1325, the section of the U.S. Code that makes unauthorized entry into the United States a federal crime.</p>\n<p>Unauthorized border crossings were first criminalized in 1929, but the law was enforced with a new zeal, as Castro <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://medium.com/@JulianCastro_63280/putting-people-first-e0f765cee00c\">noted</a> in a Medium post announcing his proposal, during the George W. Bush Administration, and it is &ldquo;at the core of many of this administration&rsquo;s most egregious immigration policies &mdash; from family separation to indiscriminate <em>ICE</em> raids to targeting asylum seekers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Castro envisions converting illegal entry from a criminal offense to a civil one and scaling back the existing enforcement regime by ending the use of for-profit detention facilities, breaking up Immigration and Customs Enforcement, dialling back Customs and Border Protection&rsquo;s mandate to act within the United States, and refocussing deportation efforts on people who are convicted of serious crimes or considered a threat to national security.</p>\n<p>Castro&rsquo;s platform is bold in many ways&mdash;it would close the book not only on Trump&rsquo;s immigration regime but on an enforcement paradigm that both preceded and enabled him. But his proposal contains few concrete suggestions for the establishment of a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented or for the reform of the existing system for legal immigration. In a conversation earlier this month, Alex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration-policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, suggested that the Presidential candidates are unlikely to address legal immigration in a substantive way. &ldquo;People are not that interested in the legal immigration system,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re almost entirely focussed on issues of border security and illegal immigration in the United States. I think legal immigration is the most important piece, but, politically, in terms of what moves people, gets them interested, shapes the debate, it&rsquo;s the least important.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Broad immigration reform is, obviously, also more politically difficult now, in a post-Trump climate. The Gang of Eight and the backers of the bipartisan reform push during the Bush years already faced an uphill climb, which has only been made steeper by the reinvigoration of right-wing nativism. Those prior reform efforts hinged on lawmakers&rsquo; ability to strike a bargain&mdash;a liberalization of the immigration system and a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented in exchange for tighter border security and the dogged enforcement of immigration laws. In supporting freer immigration and amnesty for the undocumented while also decriminalizing illegal entry and dismantling the existing enforcement regime, Castro&rsquo;s platform suggests that the Democratic Party is now far less willing to make that trade. Nowrasteh thinks that Democrats are shifting their strategy for two reasons. &ldquo;One, the realization that, during the Obama Administration, when they increased immigration enforcement dramatically, that did not provide a signal that Republicans could use to say, &lsquo;This guy is serious about immigration, so we can reform the system.&rsquo; So it didn&rsquo;t get any benefits,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And then, two, the fact that Trump is using the expanded immigration-enforcement system that he inherited from Obama and trying to do even more with it.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><figure> <video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5db0cc8bbcdfff57fdd97d57/e4ea2db9-d3ab-4068-8efd-87f7615dfa5fhigh.mp4?videoIndex=0&requester=oo\"><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video><iframe src=\"https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.365.1_en.html#goog_314761545\"></iframe><video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5db0cc8bbcdfff57fdd97d57/e4ea2db9-d3ab-4068-8efd-87f7615dfa5fthumbs.mp4\"></video> WATCH Separated by a Smuggler Share Tweet Email More... <h4>EMBED URL</h4>&lt;script async src=&quot;//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5db0cc8bbcdfff57fdd97d57.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<h4>VIDEO URL</h4>https://video.newyorker.com/watch/the-new-yorker-documentary-a-line-birds-cannot-see/ <img src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5db0cc8bbcdfff57fdd97d57/e4ea2db9-d3ab-4068-8efd-87f7615dfa5fhigh.mp4?videoIndex=0&requester=oo\"></img> <h4>This live video has ended.

In 2009, for instance, Pew <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/FT_19.01.29_ImmigrationBurden_Topline.pdf\">found</a> that forty per cent of the public believed that immigrants were mostly a burden, taking jobs and resources away from Americans. Today, only twenty-eight per cent believe that, with sixty-two per cent of Americans agreeing, instead, that immigrants mostly &ldquo;strengthen our country because of their hard work and talents&rdquo;&mdash;a sixteen-point jump from the forty-six per cent of Americans who agreed with that statement in 2009. According to <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx\">Gallup</a>, the proportion of Americans who support increasing immigration has grown from fourteen per cent, a decade ago, to thirty per cent today. This is a constituency just one percentage point smaller than the one that has driven American political discourse and punditry for the past four years: Americans who believe immigration should be decreased. A decade ago, half of the American public believed this. Now only thirty-one per cent do.</p>\n<p>A Democratic Party that is more willing to talk affirmatively and unapologetically about the benefits of immigration will find itself well in tune with an electorate that, contrary to popular perception, is moving left on the issue. Castro&rsquo;s platform is a step in that direction. Some immigration advocates are holding out hope that he or another candidate might go even further. Jawetz told me, &ldquo;the border right now is so frequently described only as a security problem. It&rsquo;s not viewed as an opportunity&mdash;where a cultural explosion takes place, where creativity is.&rdquo; He suggested that Castro or Beto O&rsquo;Rourke, who often talks about his roots in the border city of El Paso, could play a role in shifting that messaging. Really, any of the candidates might. The immigration lane is still wide open.</p>",

Bush Administration, and it is \u201cat the core of many of this administration\u2019s most egregious immigration policies \u2014 from family separation to indiscriminate ICE raids to targeting asylum seekers.\u201d\nCastro envisions converting illegal entry from a criminal offense to a civil one and scaling back the existing enforcement regime by ending the use of for-profit detention facilities, breaking up Immigration and Customs Enforcement, dialling back Customs and Border Protection\u2019s mandate to act within the United States, and refocussing deportation efforts on people who are convicted of serious crimes or considered a threat to national security.\nCastro\u2019s platform is bold in many ways\u2014it would close the book not only on Trump\u2019s immigration regime but on an enforcement paradigm that both preceded and enabled him. But his proposal contains few concrete suggestions for the establishment of a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented or for the reform of the existing system for legal immigration. In a conversation earlier this month, Alex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration-policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, suggested that the Presidential candidates are unlikely to address legal immigration in a substantive way. \u201cPeople are not that interested in the legal immigration system,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re almost entirely focussed on issues of border security and illegal immigration in the United States. I think legal immigration is the most important piece, but, politically, in terms of what moves people, gets them interested, shapes the debate, it\u2019s the least important.\u201d\nBroad immigration reform is, obviously, also more politically difficult now, in a post-Trump climate. The Gang of Eight and the backers of the bipartisan reform push during the Bush years already faced an uphill climb, which has only been made steeper by the reinvigoration of right-wing nativism. Those prior reform efforts hinged on lawmakers\u2019 ability to strike a bargain\u2014a liberalization of the immigration system and a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented in exchange for tighter border security and the dogged enforcement of immigration laws. In supporting freer immigration and amnesty for the undocumented while also decriminalizing illegal entry and dismantling the existing enforcement regime, Castro\u2019s platform suggests that the Democratic Party is now far less willing to make that trade. Nowrasteh thinks that Democrats are shifting their strategy for two reasons. \u201cOne, the realization that, during the Obama Administration, when they increased immigration enforcement dramatically, that did not provide a signal that Republicans could use to say, \u2018This guy is serious about immigration, so we can reform the system.\u2019 So it didn\u2019t get any benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then, two, the fact that Trump is using the expanded immigration-enforcement system that he inherited from Obama and trying to do even more with it.\u201d\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH Separated by a Smuggler Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5db0cc8bbcdfff57fdd97d57.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://video.newyorker.com/watch/the-new-yorker-documentary-a-line-birds-cannot-see/\nThis live video has ended.

In 2009, for instance, Pew found that forty per cent of the public believed that immigrants were mostly a burden, taking jobs and resources away from Americans. Today, only twenty-eight per cent believe that, with sixty-two per cent of Americans agreeing, instead, that immigrants mostly \u201cstrengthen our country because of their hard work and talents\u201d\u2014a sixteen-point jump from the forty-six per cent of Americans who agreed with that statement in 2009. According to Gallup, the proportion of Americans who support increasing immigration has grown from fourteen per cent, a decade ago, to thirty per cent today. This is a constituency just one percentage point smaller than the one that has driven American political discourse and punditry for the past four years: Americans who believe immigration should be decreased. A decade ago, half of the American public believed this. Now only thirty-one per cent do.\nA Democratic Party that is more willing to talk affirmatively and unapologetically about the benefits of immigration will find itself well in tune with an electorate that, contrary to popular perception, is moving left on the issue. Castro\u2019s platform is a step in that direction. Some immigration advocates are holding out hope that he or another candidate might go even further. Jawetz told me, \u201cthe border right now is so frequently described only as a security problem. It\u2019s not viewed as an opportunity\u2014where a cultural explosion takes place, where creativity is.\u201d He suggested that Castro or Beto O\u2019Rourke, who often talks about his roots in the border city of El Paso, could play a role in shifting that messaging. Really, any of the candidates might. The immigration lane is still wide open.",

This month, he made headlines by leading a Passover song in praise of the President.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The journey of Norm Coleman, the former Republican senator from Minnesota, is an instructive one. Coleman, who started his political career as a Democrat, was the mayor of St. Paul, from 1994 to 2002. He served one term in the Senate before losing his seat to Al Franken, by just more than three hundred votes, in 2008. He now works in the private sector, as the chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition and as a lawyer and lobbyist representing the Saudi government. When <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a> won the Republican Presidential nomination, Coleman reacted with a horror shared by many members of the political establishment. In an <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"http://www.startribune.com/norm-coleman-i-will-never-vote-for-donald-trump/370932321/\">op-ed</a> published in March, 2016, titled &ldquo;I Will Never Vote for Donald Trump,&rdquo; Coleman called Trump &ldquo;a bigot. A misogynist. A fraud. A bully.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;And any man who declines to renounce the affections of the KKK and David Duke should not be trusted to lead America. Ever.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ever&rdquo; is a long time, but this month Coleman made <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://forward.com/fast-forward/422201/republican-jewish-coalition-donald-trump-dayenu/\">headlines</a> by leading a Passover song in praise of President Trump at the R.J.C.&rsquo;s annual meeting, in Las Vegas. &ldquo;Dayenu&rdquo; (&ldquo;It would have been enough&rdquo;) is meant to give thanks to God, but Coleman replaced the Almighty with Trump, saying, &ldquo;Had President Trump only passed the largest tax cut in history&mdash;say it with me&mdash;Dayenu.&rdquo; Trump also addressed the group, telling it that he supported &ldquo;your Prime Minister&rdquo;&mdash;the Israeli Prime Minister, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/benjamin-netanyahu\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>&mdash;days before <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-netanyahus-apparent-victory-says-about-israels-future\">Netanyahu appeared to win re&euml;lection</a>, much to the delight of many conservative American Jews.</p>\n<p>I recently spoke by phone with Coleman. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why he has changed his mind about Trump, his lobbying for Saudi Arabia, and whether a supporter of Israel can be anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the main goal of the R.J.C.?</strong></p>\n<p>The main goal of the R.J.C. is to help elect Republicans who strengthen U.S.-Israel ties and promote Republican values.</p>\n<p><strong>What does &ldquo;strengthen U.S.-Israel ties&rdquo; mean?</strong></p>\n<p>It means supporting individuals&mdash;principally at the federal level, in Congress&mdash;who, by their deeds, by their commitments, support a strong U.S.-Israel relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>What does that consist of?</strong></p>\n<p>You look at an individual matter&mdash;for instance, the Iran deal. The deal Obama did with Iran represented an existential threat to Israel&rsquo;s existence. That means we would be supporting senators, congressmen, Presidents who would oppose that deal, because doing it would have and did create an existential threat to Israel&rsquo;s existence.</p>\n<p>It may mean standing up for Israel at the United Nations. It has been an organization that has an obsession with anti-Israel action. The Human Rights Council, you go back historically, I don&rsquo;t know, eighty per cent, ninety per cent of their resolutions focus on Israel and the Palestinians. They don&rsquo;t focus on what is happening in Iran, or Sudan, or China. [<em>According to <a data-event-click=\"{\" href=\"https://www.unwatch.org/un-israel-key-statistics/\">U.N. watchdogs</a>, since the H.R.C. was founded, in 2006, more than half of its condemnatory resolutions have concerned Israel.</em>] Those matters that weaken the state of Israel are important to the R.J.C., because we fundamentally believe that a strong Israel is important to the U.S.&rsquo;s national security.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think there are areas where American and Israeli interests diverge, and how should the politicians you support deal with that?</strong></p>\n<p>I presume that one could have disagreements with certain aspects of Israeli policy, and so I think people, in that instance, have to make a choice as to whether that is something we should be supporting, we should be involved in.</p>\n<p><strong>Could be a tough choice.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, well, I mean, listen, we are Americans, our interest is American national security, and I want to reiterate our fundamental belief that a strong Israel is critical to American national security. I forget the general who said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need an aircraft carrier in that portion of the world. Israel is there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But, if there&rsquo;s Israeli domestic policy that one may disagree with, yeah, that&rsquo;s legitimate. I don&rsquo;t involve myself much with Israeli domestic policy. But, by way of example, women praying at the Western Wall&mdash;I believe that is something that should absolutely happen. In Israel, the Orthodox may believe different. [<em>Liberal and ultra-Orthodox groups have clashed for decades over the gender-segregated prayer sections at the Western Wall.</em>] We disagree on that issue. But that&rsquo;s not an issue that we&rsquo;re looking at as being central to America&rsquo;s security and Israel&rsquo;s security.</p>\n<p><strong>You said recently that you were &ldquo;foolishly among the doubters&rdquo; when it came to Donald Trump. What do you think you misjudged about him, or what do you think you were too harsh about when it came to him?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I was pretty harsh. I am from Brooklyn, New York. I think I was at that point supporting Marco Rubio. But what I misjudged was his commitment to live up to his word. The issue of whether Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of Israel: that is something that has been enshrined in U.S. law for over thirty years. Every American President since 1992 has said they were going to move the Embassy. But Donald Trump is the one who promised and the one who delivered. I misjudged the depth and the measure of his commitment to Israel&rsquo;s security. [<em>Both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush said, as Presidential candidates, that they supported moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem. In 2008, Barack Obama said that &ldquo;Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided.&rdquo;</em>]</p>\n<p><strong>When you look back on the things you said, calling him a &ldquo;bigot&rdquo; and &ldquo;misogynist,&rdquo; do you think you were wrong?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I think I misjudged the President. I think I was harsh because I was pushing something else.</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Misogynist&rdquo; and &ldquo;bigot&rdquo; are tough words.</strong></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m from Brooklyn. It was a political campaign. You say tough things. But, in the end, I am measuring this President by his deeds. By the economy, by what he has done with regulation. I had a conversation about this with someone at the R.J.C. convention. And they asked me about Cyrus the Great. In Jewish history, he is praised as a great liberator. And this person asked me, &ldquo;So what do you know about his personal character? Do you know how he treated his wife? He didn&rsquo;t have tweets, but how did he deal with folks he didn&rsquo;t want to work with anymore?&rdquo; Of course, the answer is no, because we judge him by his deeds. In fifty years, people are not going to judge Donald Trump by his tweets or personal comments; they are going to judge him by what he did, what he accomplished.</p>\n<p><strong>Is saying that there were good people on both sides in <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/charlottesville\">Charlottesville</a> deeds or words?</strong></p>\n<p>No, no, no, I have criticized him. I have criticized him where I thought his response wasn&rsquo;t adequate or wasn&rsquo;t appropriate. Do I think Donald Trump is anti-Semitic? Just the opposite. He is surrounded by Jews and has done more to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship than any President. I thought his response to Charlottesville was weak, and I criticized him for that. I choose in this conversation not to go into details about how he fired someone or what words he used. When I wake up in the morning, with my family&mdash;typically, American families, when they wake up, are concerned with whether Mom and Dad are going to work, is the family safe, is there an opportunity out there for them? And then, for those of us who care about Israel, that&rsquo;s part of the mix. We do care about Israel&rsquo;s security today. This President has done well.</p>\n<figure><video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5dfb972634e7945990dec215/e4c62a19-5bfb-4fd1-ba95-8421dc1c4087high.mp4?videoIndex=0&requester=oo\"><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video><iframe src=\"https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.365.1_en.html#goog_1656997808\"></iframe><video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5dfb972634e7945990dec215/e4c62a19-5bfb-4fd1-ba95-8421dc1c4087thumbs.mp4\"></video><h4>EMBED URL</h4><h4>VIDEO URL</h4><h4>Our bad!

                "text": "The journey of Norm Coleman, the former Republican senator from Minnesota, is an instructive one. Coleman, who started his political career as a Democrat, was the mayor of St. Paul, from 1994 to 2002. He served one term in the Senate before losing his seat to Al Franken, by just more than three hundred votes, in 2008. He now works in the private sector, as the chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition and as a lawyer and lobbyist representing the Saudi government. When Donald Trump won the Republican Presidential nomination, Coleman reacted with a horror shared by many members of the political establishment. In an op-ed published in March, 2016, titled \u201cI Will Never Vote for Donald Trump,\u201d Coleman called Trump \u201ca bigot. A misogynist. A fraud. A bully.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd any man who declines to renounce the affections of the KKK and David Duke should not be trusted to lead America. Ever.\u201d\n\u201cEver\u201d is a long time, but this month Coleman made headlines by leading a Passover song in praise of President Trump at the R.J.C.\u2019s annual meeting, in Las Vegas. \u201cDayenu\u201d (\u201cIt would have been enough\u201d) is meant to give thanks to God, but Coleman replaced the Almighty with Trump, saying, \u201cHad President Trump only passed the largest tax cut in history\u2014say it with me\u2014Dayenu.\u201d Trump also addressed the group, telling it that he supported \u201cyour Prime Minister\u201d\u2014the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2014days before Netanyahu appeared to win re\u00eblection, much to the delight of many conservative American Jews.\nI recently spoke by phone with Coleman. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why he has changed his mind about Trump, his lobbying for Saudi Arabia, and whether a supporter of Israel can be anti-Semitic.\nWhat is the main goal of the R.J.C.?\nThe main goal of the R.J.C. is to help elect Republicans who strengthen U.S.-Israel ties and promote Republican values.\nWhat does \u201cstrengthen U.S.-Israel ties\u201d mean?\nIt means supporting individuals\u2014principally at the federal level, in Congress\u2014who, by their deeds, by their commitments, support a strong U.S.-Israel relationship.\nWhat does that consist of?\nYou look at an individual matter\u2014for instance, the Iran deal. The deal Obama did with Iran represented an existential threat to Israel\u2019s existence. That means we would be supporting senators, congressmen, Presidents who would oppose that deal, because doing it would have and did create an existential threat to Israel\u2019s existence.\nIt may mean standing up for Israel at the United Nations. It has been an organization that has an obsession with anti-Israel action. The Human Rights Council, you go back historically, I don\u2019t know, eighty per cent, ninety per cent of their resolutions focus on Israel and the Palestinians. They don\u2019t focus on what is happening in Iran, or Sudan, or China. [According to U.N. watchdogs, since the H.R.C. was founded, in 2006, more than half of its condemnatory resolutions have concerned Israel.] Those matters that weaken the state of Israel are important to the R.J.C., because we fundamentally believe that a strong Israel is important to the U.S.\u2019s national security.\nDo you think there are areas where American and Israeli interests diverge, and how should the politicians you support deal with that?\nI presume that one could have disagreements with certain aspects of Israeli policy, and so I think people, in that instance, have to make a choice as to whether that is something we should be supporting, we should be involved in.\nCould be a tough choice.\nYeah, well, I mean, listen, we are Americans, our interest is American national security, and I want to reiterate our fundamental belief that a strong Israel is critical to American national security. I forget the general who said, \u201cI don\u2019t need an aircraft carrier in that portion of the world. Israel is there.\u201d\nBut, if there\u2019s Israeli domestic policy that one may disagree with, yeah, that\u2019s legitimate. I don\u2019t involve myself much with Israeli domestic policy. But, by way of example, women praying at the Western Wall\u2014I believe that is something that should absolutely happen. In Israel, the Orthodox may believe different. [Liberal and ultra-Orthodox groups have clashed for decades over the gender-segregated prayer sections at the Western Wall.] We disagree on that issue. But that\u2019s not an issue that we\u2019re looking at as being central to America\u2019s security and Israel\u2019s security.\nYou said recently that you were \u201cfoolishly among the doubters\u201d when it came to Donald Trump. What do you think you misjudged about him, or what do you think you were too harsh about when it came to him?\nWell, I was pretty harsh. I am from Brooklyn, New York. I think I was at that point supporting Marco Rubio. But what I misjudged was his commitment to live up to his word. The issue of whether Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of Israel: that is something that has been enshrined in U.S. law for over thirty years. Every American President since 1992 has said they were going to move the Embassy. But Donald Trump is the one who promised and the one who delivered. I misjudged the depth and the measure of his commitment to Israel\u2019s security. [Both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush said, as Presidential candidates, that they supported moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem. In 2008, Barack Obama said that \u201cJerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided.\u201d]\nWhen you look back on the things you said, calling him a \u201cbigot\u201d and \u201cmisogynist,\u201d do you think you were wrong?\nYeah, I think I misjudged the President. I think I was harsh because I was pushing something else.\n\u201cMisogynist\u201d and \u201cbigot\u201d are tough words.\nI\u2019m from Brooklyn. It was a political campaign. You say tough things. But, in the end, I am measuring this President by his deeds. By the economy, by what he has done with regulation. I had a conversation about this with someone at the R.J.C. convention. And they asked me about Cyrus the Great. In Jewish history, he is praised as a great liberator. And this person asked me, \u201cSo what do you know about his personal character? Do you know how he treated his wife? He didn\u2019t have tweets, but how did he deal with folks he didn\u2019t want to work with anymore?\u201d Of course, the answer is no, because we judge him by his deeds. In fifty years, people are not going to judge Donald Trump by his tweets or personal comments; they are going to judge him by what he did, what he accomplished.\nIs saying that there were good people on both sides in Charlottesville deeds or words?\nNo, no, no, I have criticized him. I have criticized him where I thought his response wasn\u2019t adequate or wasn\u2019t appropriate. Do I think Donald Trump is anti-Semitic? Just the opposite. He is surrounded by Jews and has done more to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship than any President. I thought his response to Charlottesville was weak, and I criticized him for that. I choose in this conversation not to go into details about how he fired someone or what words he used. When I wake up in the morning, with my family\u2014typically, American families, when they wake up, are concerned with whether Mom and Dad are going to work, is the family safe, is there an opportunity out there for them? And then, for those of us who care about Israel, that\u2019s part of the mix. We do care about Israel\u2019s security today. This President has done well.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH President Trump Is Impeached Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5dfb972634e7945990dec215.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://video.newyorker.com/watch/president-trump-is-impeached/\nOur bad!

They face between six months and 10 years in prison if found guilty. The prosecutors are also seeking to confiscate between &euro;300,000 and &euro;11m in bonus payments, which were allegedly boosted by the emissions fraud.</p>\n<p>Winterkorn is accused by the prosecutors of a &ldquo;particularly serious case of fraud&rdquo;, as well as breaching competition law. Winterkorn has previously denied wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>The installation of &ldquo;defeat device&rdquo; software in VW cars to fool emissions tests has turned into one of the biggest scandals in German corporate history. The so-called dieselgate scandal has cost the company more than &euro;27bn in fines in the US and <a data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a>. VW has already apologised and pleaded guilty to criminal charges.</p>\n<p>The software enabled 9m cars, including Volkswagen, Audi and Skoda models, to remain below legal limits for emissions of harmful nitrogen oxides when in test conditions, while continuing to deliver the performance benefits of less stringent standards on the roads.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen oxides have been blamed for a global public health crisis, contributing to tens of thousands of premature deaths from <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/15/diesel-emissions-test-scandal-causes-38000-early-deaths-year-study\">heart and lung disease and strokes</a> every year. Without the software, VW&rsquo;s vehicles would not have been approved as road legal, the prosecutors said.</p>\n<p>The fallout from the scandal has hit demand for diesel vehicles across other carmakers in Europe, amid evidence that <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/23/diesel-cars-pollution-limits-nox-emissions\">nearly all diesel vehicles</a> exceeded emissions standards in real-world conditions.</p>\n<p>The Braunschweig action is one of a number of ongoing legal actions against VW and its former top executives over the dieselgate scandal.</p>\n<p>Winterkorn and five other former executives have already been <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/03/vw-emissions-cheating-michael-winterkorn-charged\">charged by US authorities</a> with fraud, but they cannot be extradited from Germany to non-EU countries.</p>\n<p>Former engineering executive Oliver Schmidt was <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/06/oliver-schmidt-jailed-volkswagen-emissions-scam-seven-years\">imprisoned for seven years</a> in the US for his part in hiding the software from regulators.

                "text": "The former boss of Volkswagen (VW) and four other executives face up to a decade in prison after being charged with fraud by German prosecutors over the carmaker\u2019s systematic cheating in emissions tests on diesel vehicles.\nMartin Winterkorn resigned as chief executive in September 2015 after US authorities accused VW of deliberately manipulating its cars\u2019 performance under emissions test conditions \u2013 meaning its vehicle emissions seemed much less polluting than in normal driving.\nWinterkorn personally knew of the emissions cheating from at least May 2014, much earlier than he had admitted, the prosecutors alleged in a statement on Monday.\nVW has already admitted that Winterkorn, aged 71, received a memo detailing the cheating in May 2014, but said he may not have read it.\nWhile VW has previously pleaded guilty to corporate criminal charges, it has denied senior executives were directly involved, insisting it was limited to engineers.\nHowever, prosecutors said Winterkorn approved the expenditure of \u20ac23m (\u00a320m) on a \u201cuseless\u201d software update which was designed to continue obscuring the real reason for the increased levels of pollutants from its cars in real-world conditions.\nThe alleged offences of Winterkorn and the other unnamed managers took place between November 2006 and September 2015, according to prosecutors in Braunschweig, near VW\u2019s global headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany.\n/business/ng-interactive/2015/sep/23/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-explained-diesel-cars\nThe prosecutors said the indictment runs to 692 pages, plus another 300 file folders containing 75,000 pages of evidence against the accused. They face between six months and 10 years in prison if found guilty. The prosecutors are also seeking to confiscate between \u20ac300,000 and \u20ac11m in bonus payments, which were allegedly boosted by the emissions fraud.\nWinterkorn is accused by the prosecutors of a \u201cparticularly serious case of fraud\u201d, as well as breaching competition law. Winterkorn has previously denied wrongdoing.\nThe installation of \u201cdefeat device\u201d software in VW cars to fool emissions tests has turned into one of the biggest scandals in German corporate history. The so-called dieselgate scandal has cost the company more than \u20ac27bn in fines in the US and Europe. VW has already apologised and pleaded guilty to criminal charges.\nThe software enabled 9m cars, including Volkswagen, Audi and Skoda models, to remain below legal limits for emissions of harmful nitrogen oxides when in test conditions, while continuing to deliver the performance benefits of less stringent standards on the roads.\nNitrogen oxides have been blamed for a global public health crisis, contributing to tens of thousands of premature deaths from heart and lung disease and strokes every year. Without the software, VW\u2019s vehicles would not have been approved as road legal, the prosecutors said.\nThe fallout from the scandal has hit demand for diesel vehicles across other carmakers in Europe, amid evidence that nearly all diesel vehicles exceeded emissions standards in real-world conditions.\nThe Braunschweig action is one of a number of ongoing legal actions against VW and its former top executives over the dieselgate scandal.\nWinterkorn and five other former executives have already been charged by US authorities with fraud, but they cannot be extradited from Germany to non-EU countries.\nFormer engineering executive Oliver Schmidt was imprisoned for seven years in the US for his part in hiding the software from regulators. He was arrested when attempting to return to Germany following a family holiday in Florida.\nLast month the US Securities and Exchange Commission announced it was suing Volkswagen and its former chief executive, accusing them of defrauding investors by making \u201cdeceptive\u201d claims about the environmental impact of its cars. Investors in Germany are also seeking damages over VW\u2019s failure to disclose the issue.\nAnother 36 people remain under investigation in Germany by the Braunschweig prosecutors. VW also faces a group litigation from British owners of its vehicles over alleged false misrepresentation of the cars\u2019 emissions.\nA Volkswagen spokesman said the company would not comment on investigations against individuals.\nIn a statement Felix D\u00f6rr, Winterkorn\u2019s lawyer, said the prosecutors had not given the defence enough time to read and comment on new evidence presented in the indictment.",

                "text": "Germany\u2019s troubled Deutsche Bank faces fines, legal action and the possible prosecution of \u201csenior management\u201d because of its role in a $20bn Russian money-laundering scheme, a confidential internal report seen by the Guardian says.\nThe bank admits there is a high risk that regulators in the US and UK will take \u201csignificant disciplinary action\u201d against it. Deutsche concedes that the scandal has hurt its \u201cglobal brand\u201d \u2013 and is likely to cause \u201cclient attrition\u201d, loss of investor confidence and a decline in its market value.\nDeutsche Bank was embroiled in a vast money-laundering operation, dubbed the Global Laundromat. Russian criminals with links to the Kremlin, the old KGB and its main successor, the FSB, used the scheme between 2010 and 2014 to move money into the western financial system. The cash involved could total $80bn, detectives believe.\nShell companies typically based in the UK \u201cloaned\u201d money to each other. Companies then defaulted on this large fictitious debt. Corrupt judges in Moldova authenticated the debt \u2013 with billions transferred to Moldova and the Baltics via a bank in Latvia.\nDeutsche Bank was used to launder the money via its corresponding banking network \u2013 effectively allowing illegal Russian payments to be funnelled to the US, the European Union and Asia.\nThe bank was entirely unaware of the scam until the Guardian and Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) broke the story in March 2017, the report says. The first it knew was an email from the Guardian and Germany\u2019s S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper asking for comment.\n\u201cOnly with this intelligence received is it now possible for Deutsche Bank to start global investigations,\u201d it notes.\n/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\nIn the embarrassing aftermath, the bank asked two in-house financial crime investigators \u2013 Philippe Vollot and Hinrich V\u00f6lcker \u2013 to find out what had gone wrong. Their nine-page presentation was shared last year with the audit committee of the bank\u2019s supervisory board and is marked \u201cstrictly confidential\u201d.\nThe pair identified numerous \u201chigh-risk entities\u201d. They included 1,244 in the US, 329 in the UK and 950 in Germany. These entities were responsible for nearly 700,000 transactions, the report says, involving at least \u00a362m in the UK, $47m in the US, and \u20ac55m in Germany.\nAs part of its investigation, Deutsche Bank sent 149 \u201csuspicious activity reports\u201d to the National Crime Agency in London. Similar disclosures of potential money-laundering transactions were made to authorities in the US and elsewhere \u2013 with 30 private and corporate Deutsche Bank clients reported. Some may have been \u201cunknowingly used\u201d, the report says.\nThe affair is a further blow to Deutsche Banks\u2019s ailing reputation. It comes amid police raids on its Frankfurt HQ over the Panama Papers, a plunging share price and talks over a possible merger with Germany\u2019s Commerzbank. The raid last November came after German prosecutors alleged two bank employees helped clients launder money via offshore firms.\nDeutsche is also under scrutiny in Washington over its financial dealings with Donald Trump. On 15 April, Democrats from the House intelligence and financial services committees issued a subpoena, demanding the bank provide documents about its lending to the president.\nOver two decades, Trump borrowed more than $2bn from Deutsche. In 2008, he defaulted on a $45m loan repayment and sued the bank. Its private wealth division in New York subsequently loaned Trump a further $300m \u2013 a move that bemused insiders and which has yet to be fully explained.\nIn recent years, the bank has had a series of bruising encounters with international regulators. Between 2011 and 2018, it paid $14.5bn in fines, with exposure to dubious Russian money a regular theme.\nIn 2017, the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority imposed its largest fine \u2013 \u00a3163m \u2013 after Deutsche carried out a $10bn \u201cmirror trade\u201d scheme run out of its branch in Moscow. The New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) fined the bank $425m over the same case, in which roubles were converted into dollars via fake trades on behalf of VIP Russian clients.\nDeutsche carried out an internal investigation into the \u201cmirror trades\u201d affair, \u201cProject Square\u201d. The leaked Global Laundromat report says there is \u201cno systematic link\u201d between the two Russian money-laundering schemes. However, it suggests some overlap. Two unnamed entities feature in both and 46 \u201cmirror trade\u201d entities \u201cdirectly transacted\u201d with 233 laundromat ones.\nThe leaked report says Deutsche has cleaned up its act. It says it has stopped doing business with the two banks at the centre of the Laundromat scandal \u2013 Moldova\u2019s Moldindconbank and Latvia\u2019s Trasta Komercbanka. Regulators in Latvia closed down Trasta in 2016 because of serial money-laundering violations.\nDeutsche Bank says it has \u201creduced its footprint\u201d across the post-Soviet region. It no longer has relationships with any banks in Moldova, Latvia, Estonia and Cyprus, the report says. All are favourite destinations for illicit Moscow money. The bank has scaled down its business activities in Russia and Ukraine, it says.\nThe bank is under investigation for its role in Europe\u2019s biggest banking scandal, involving Denmark\u2019s Danske Bank. Danske laundered \u20ac200bn (\u00a3178bn) of Russian money via its branch in Estonia. Deutsche provided correspondent banking services via its US subsidiary.\nDeutsche Bank said it could not comment on \u201cpotential or ongoing investigations\u201d, or on \u201cany matters regarding our regulators\u201d. It said it was committed to providing \u201cappropriate information to all authorised investigations\u201d.\nThe bank said: \u201cWe have considerably increased staff numbers in anti-financial crime and more than tripled our staff since 2015. Since 2016 we have invested \u20ac700m in upgrading our key control functions there.\u201d",

There are many<a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://wcyb.com/news/local/students-at-tennessee-school-told-to-take-off-trump-gear\"> local news</a> reports about children being asked to remove them, or claiming they&rsquo;ve been abused for wearing one. Washington DC, an overwhelmingly Democratic city, often encounters an influx of children on school trips in Maga hats, making residents bristle.</p>\n<p>Maddie Mueller, a student at Clovis North high school in Fresno, California, is the latest example. She was prohibited from wearing her Maga hat by teachers, so she&rsquo;s now suing the school district, claiming she has a first amendment right to wear it.</p>\n<p>School officials say they simply don&rsquo;t allow certain logos as part of the dress code, but Mueller has responded saying, &ldquo;to my knowledge, Trump is not a logo. It&rsquo;s a last name. It&rsquo;s just our president.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How is being a patriot in trying to show pride in your country &ndash; how is that inappropriate?&rdquo;</p>\n<figure data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT17dlcExZQ\" data-component=\"video-inbody-embed\">  <iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HT17dlcExZQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\"></iframe>  </figure>\n<p>Soon after the story broke, Mueller made an appearance on Laura Ingraham&rsquo;s Fox News show, claiming that the school was discriminating against her because she &ldquo;checked today&rdquo; and saw four Hillary Clinton T-shirts, a Bernie Sanders hat, an Obama shirt and seven LGBTQ rainbow flag hats.

                "text": "For some middle and high schoolers, wearing a Maga hat has become not only a sign of their political allegiance, but an act of rebellion. There are many local news reports about children being asked to remove them, or claiming they\u2019ve been abused for wearing one. Washington DC, an overwhelmingly Democratic city, often encounters an influx of children on school trips in Maga hats, making residents bristle.\nMaddie Mueller, a student at Clovis North high school in Fresno, California, is the latest example. She was prohibited from wearing her Maga hat by teachers, so she\u2019s now suing the school district, claiming she has a first amendment right to wear it.\nSchool officials say they simply don\u2019t allow certain logos as part of the dress code, but Mueller has responded saying, \u201cto my knowledge, Trump is not a logo. It\u2019s a last name. It\u2019s just our president.\n\u201cHow is being a patriot in trying to show pride in your country \u2013 how is that inappropriate?\u201d\nSoon after the story broke, Mueller made an appearance on Laura Ingraham\u2019s Fox News show, claiming that the school was discriminating against her because she \u201cchecked today\u201d and saw four Hillary Clinton T-shirts, a Bernie Sanders hat, an Obama shirt and seven LGBTQ rainbow flag hats. Ingraham asked Mueller if these items were worn \u201cin classrooms\u201d and she said yes.\nIngraham said she had no reason to question Mueller\u2019s claim that she saw four students in Clinton hats, two years after the presidential election, or that she had checked to make sure they were still wearing them in class. She did call her \u201cedgy\u201d and \u201cbrave\u201d.\nIn January, students from Covington Catholic high school on a trip to Washington made headlines after they were filmed apparently taunting a group of indigenous Americans. They were widely criticised by most of the media, but Fox and Friends painted them as victims of cruel online bullying simply because they displayed their political beliefs. Before that, a Texas 16-year-old tweeted about having his hat stolen and a drink thrown at him, Trump himself sent over a Maga hat.\nKelly Avants, the chief communication officer for the Clovis Unified school district, told a CBS affiliate that the school\u2019s dress code \u201cis for kids to feel safe at school and free of distractions so they can focus on learning\u201d.\nThe district\u2019s dress code is available online and states that no hats or caps may be worn inside classrooms and offices. It also bans many logos and brands, and specifically bans clothing or apparel that can be worn for the purpose of \u201charassing, threatening, or intimidating others\u201d.",

Authorities say she joined the United Cyber Caliphate, a hacking group that pledges allegiance to the extremist group.\nThe group posted thousands of names and addresses online and urged followers to murder the people on the lists in lone-wolf attacks, according to a criminal complaint. Targets included members of the US military and employees of the state department.\nVo, who lives in Hephzibah, Georgia, allegedly edited and translated pro-Isis messages shared online and recruited new members. She also allegedly assisted with hacking projects.\nIn 2016, the United Cyber Caliphate posted to Twitter the names, addresses and personal information of 3,602 people in the New York City area, prosecutors say.\n\u201cList of the most important citizens of #NewYork and #Brooklyn and some other cities,\u201d the post said. \u201cWe Want Them #Dead.\u201d\nAnother list, posted in April 2017, contained the names and information of more than 8,700 people, thousands of whom live in the US, the complaint says. The data was stolen from the website of a US company, agents charge.\nThe spreadsheet was posted with a \u201ckill list video\u201d that included footage of a man being decapitated.\n\u201cWe have a message to the people of the US,\u201d the video said, \u201cand most importantly, your President Trump: know that we continue to wage war against you, know that your counter-attacks only makes us stronger. We will release a list with over 8,000 names, addresses and email addresses \u2026 Kill them wherever you find them.\u201d\nProsecutors say Vo helped recruit a 14-year-old in Norway. The teenager posted a video threatening a New York non-profit that works to combat extremism with the message: \u201cYou messed with the Islamic State SO EXPECT US SOON.\u201d\nVo went by online aliases including Miss.Bones, Kitty Lee, Zozo, and F@ng, according to the complaint. In one online exchange, she wrote about taking on a new name \u201cjust so I can bring on a more mass destruction\u201d.\nIn another message, she allegedly cheered a terror attack in London in 2017 in which the attacker drove a car into a crowd on Westminster Bridge, killing four people, then fatally stabbed a police officer.\n\u201cHey this gives me an idea,\u201d she allegedly wrote, saying Isis supporters should \u201cuse this recent success attack\u201d as a model to encourage violence in other countries.\nIf convicted, Vo faces up to 20 years in prison. Her parents told the Augusta Chronicle they were shocked.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a good girl,\u201d said her father, Long Vo.",

She had also written on her face the words \u201cI care\u201d and turned up in court with fellow activists in support.\nShe had been facing up to 18 months in prison and had lately been under house arrest for breaking her bail conditions after carrying out a direct action protest in Texas, while her New York sentencing was pending.\n\u201cI do not need probation, and I do not belong in prison. I am not a criminal,\u201d Okoumou told the judge, Gabriel Gorenstein.\nOkoumou captured the attention of the world on live TV after she broke away from a protest over harsh US immigration policy, organized at the Statue of Liberty by the activism group Rise and Resist, and, alone, began climbing the base of the statue. She had aimed to climb all the way up to the top of the figure, but was unable to ascend the slippery metal and huddled at the base of \u201cLady Liberty\u201d as law enforcement officers closed in.\nShe later told the Guardian, in an exclusive interview, that she was kept awake at night by images of migrant children ripped from their parents\u2019 arms after crossing the border and then kept in child detention centers and camps in the US.\n\u201cI had thought, \u2018It\u2019s the Statue of Liberty, it\u2019s the Fourth of July and there are children in cages, we are doing a protest but I want to send an even stronger message and this is the perfect day for it.\u2019 All of those elements together were necessary to give me the courage,\u201d she said at the time.\nOkoumou has called for the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement federal agency (Ice).\nLast November she traveled to Paris and unfurled anti-Ice banners on the Eiffel Tower, explaining to the Guardian that because the French had given America the Statue of Liberty it seemed like an appropriate location for a demonstration.\n\u201cI must continue,\u201d she said of her protests.",

Among those who still want an American education, certain populations appear to be especially at risk of scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Masume Assaf, the director of international student and scholar advising at Penn State University, has noticed Chinese nationals are suddenly being funneled into administrative processing for further review. She has watched as Iranian students have been unable to visit Iran; one of her PhD candidates who went home for a brother&rsquo;s wedding was barred from re-entering the US for months.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the most dramatic testament to the administration&rsquo;s perceived aversion to foreigners is the major drop in refugee resettlement. In fiscal year 2016, the US admitted nearly 85,000 refugees. Two years later, that number plummeted to 22,491.</p>\n<aside>   <blockquote> <p>In fiscal year 2016, the US admitted nearly 85,000 refugees. Two years later, that number plummeted to 22,491</p> </blockquote> </aside>\n<p>&ldquo;Is it deliberate? I would say that there&rsquo;s nothing being done to facilitate more efficient processing,&rdquo; said Denise Bell, the researcher for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA.</p>\n<p>On a research mission to Lebanon and Jordan in November, Bell met refugees who had been stranded because of Trump-era policies. Among them were Fawzi, his wife and two sons, who fled Iraq for Lebanon in 2013 because they feared retaliation for being Christian.</p>\n<p>In August 2016, Fawzi and his family say they received a letter with conditional approval to resettle in the US. The letter warned it would be a minimum of four months before they could get on a plane.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Four months,&rdquo; Fawzi&rsquo;s family told the Guardian, &ldquo;and we are now in two years and [a] half.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Every time they ask officials about why they are stuck in Lebanon, they get the same answer: security procedure. It&rsquo;s a similar rationale that justifies the administration&rsquo;s extreme vetting protocols for visa applicants.</p>\n<p>However, experts in immigration policy say there&rsquo;s no evidence many of the new vetting policies affecting foreign nationals work. Bier said the requirements have been devised primarily to &ldquo;obstruct legal immigration&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The ultimate goal is making it more difficult to live in the United States legally,&rdquo; Bier said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure any if these steps actually improve our security,&rdquo; added Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum. &ldquo;These are political moves by the administration to reduce immigration.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Noorani and Schulman expressed frustration that people who are trying to follow the law must now jump through cumbersome hoops as the administration cracks down on legal as well as undocumented immigration. But at least his partner&rsquo;s visa was eventually approved.</p>\n<p>She traveled to the US on 29 December, and they married at a court in Brooklyn four days later. Then they spent the next two and a half weeks poring over forms to continue her legalization process.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think the average American doesn&rsquo;t know the time, the money and the energy it takes to actually do legal immigration,&rdquo; Schulman said. &ldquo;I think people don&rsquo;t give enough credit to the folks who are doing that.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "When Moshe Schulman\u2019s then fiancee visited the United States consulate in Casablanca, he believed that she would leave her interview \u2013 for a K-1 visa \u2013 with permission to return to New York and they could finally stop conducting their relationship long-distance.\nInstead, she walked out with even more paperwork.\nThe supplementary form she was assigned \u2013 DS-5535 \u2013 is a brainchild of Donald Trump\u2019s administration. After an executive order and memorandum from the White House calling for \u201cenhanced vetting\u201d of foreign nationals, the state department also announced a three-page document for visa applicants whom consular officers believe could pose terrorist or national security threats.\nThat experience \u2013 in finding sudden new barriers to legal immigration to the US \u2013 is hardly unique. From more in-person interviews, to stricter guidance on denying student visas, to travel bans, to lower refugee caps, experts say recent policy shifts have impacted the number of foreign nationals who are coming to America. On top of that is recent news that the Trump administration wants to close all international offices of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, shifting the paperwork back to the US \u2013 but almost certainly adding to delays for those seeking to come to America from abroad.\nIs it deliberate? I would say that there\u2019s nothing being done to facilitate more efficient processing\nDenise Bell\nAs more data from the last two years become available, the long-term effects of such actions are finally coming into focus.\nDuring the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, immigration application denials increased by 37% since fiscal year 2016, according to the Cato Institute\u2019s immigration policy analyst David Bier. Reuters reported that more than 37,000 visa applications were refused in 2018 as a direct result of the administration\u2019s travel ban on primarily Muslim-majority countries.\nK-1 visas for fiances of US citizens dropped 35.7% in fiscal year 2018, compared to 2016, and student visas declined by 23%, according to state department data.\n\u201cThe key is that this is no longer speculation. We\u2019re now seeing the consequences of the rhetoric and the policy,\u201d said Miriam Feldblum, executive director of the Presidents\u2019 Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration.\nSchulman\u2019s partner \u2013 who asked to remain anonymous \u2013 spent a year in the US for an internship and completed her master\u2019s degree in France. But her history in the west didn\u2019t prevent her from being flagged for additional vetting.\nSchulman suspects his partner\u2019s obviously Arabic name had something to do with why she was targeted.\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s Islamophobia. It\u2019s racist, in my opinion,\u201d Schulman told the Guardian.\nAn estimated 65,000 visa applicants annually now have to fill out DS-5535, which requires a 15-year travel log, social media handles, a list of prior addresses and a 15-year employment history, among other information. The document is just one of myriad changes under the current administration that have made it more difficult for people to enter and stay in the country through lawful means \u2013 even as Trump says publicly that he wants foreigners in the US, but \u201cthey have to come in legally\u201d.\n/us-news/ng-interactive/2018/jul/05/donald-trump-firings-resignations-white-house-full-list-latest\nSome students are now opting to study elsewhere, avoiding an immigration climate that feels unwelcoming and hostile to foreigners. Among those who still want an American education, certain populations appear to be especially at risk of scrutiny.\nMasume Assaf, the director of international student and scholar advising at Penn State University, has noticed Chinese nationals are suddenly being funneled into administrative processing for further review. She has watched as Iranian students have been unable to visit Iran; one of her PhD candidates who went home for a brother\u2019s wedding was barred from re-entering the US for months.\nBut perhaps the most dramatic testament to the administration\u2019s perceived aversion to foreigners is the major drop in refugee resettlement. In fiscal year 2016, the US admitted nearly 85,000 refugees. Two years later, that number plummeted to 22,491.\nIn fiscal year 2016, the US admitted nearly 85,000 refugees. Two years later, that number plummeted to 22,491\n\u201cIs it deliberate? I would say that there\u2019s nothing being done to facilitate more efficient processing,\u201d said Denise Bell, the researcher for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA.\nOn a research mission to Lebanon and Jordan in November, Bell met refugees who had been stranded because of Trump-era policies. Among them were Fawzi, his wife and two sons, who fled Iraq for Lebanon in 2013 because they feared retaliation for being Christian.\nIn August 2016, Fawzi and his family say they received a letter with conditional approval to resettle in the US. The letter warned it would be a minimum of four months before they could get on a plane.\n\u201cFour months,\u201d Fawzi\u2019s family told the Guardian, \u201cand we are now in two years and [a] half.\u201d\nEvery time they ask officials about why they are stuck in Lebanon, they get the same answer: security procedure. It\u2019s a similar rationale that justifies the administration\u2019s extreme vetting protocols for visa applicants.\nHowever, experts in immigration policy say there\u2019s no evidence many of the new vetting policies affecting foreign nationals work. Bier said the requirements have been devised primarily to \u201cobstruct legal immigration\u201d.\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is making it more difficult to live in the United States legally,\u201d Bier said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure any if these steps actually improve our security,\u201d added Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum. \u201cThese are political moves by the administration to reduce immigration.\u201d\nNoorani and Schulman expressed frustration that people who are trying to follow the law must now jump through cumbersome hoops as the administration cracks down on legal as well as undocumented immigration. But at least his partner\u2019s visa was eventually approved.\nShe traveled to the US on 29 December, and they married at a court in Brooklyn four days later. Then they spent the next two and a half weeks poring over forms to continue her legalization process.\n\u201cI think the average American doesn\u2019t know the time, the money and the energy it takes to actually do legal immigration,\u201d Schulman said. \u201cI think people don\u2019t give enough credit to the folks who are doing that.\u201d",

                "text": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email.\nGood morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories.\nCommons Speaker blocks new votes on May\u2019s Brexit deal\nWith just 10 days until Britain is due to leave the EU, the Brexit process has been thrown into further chaos by the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, who blocked a repeat vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal on Monday, saying it would violate parliamentary convention to vote on the same bill twice without substantial alterations. Bercow\u2019s decision blindsided the prime minister, who must now look to the EU to offer an extension to the Brexit deadline.\nSpeaker\u2019s choice. Bercow\u2019s decision was praised by some MPs and criticised by others. Peter Walker explains his reasoning and its implications.\nBritons abroad. Meanwhile in Brussels, a dwindling group of UK civil servants are preparing to remain in their EU jobs after Britain leaves the bloc.\nArdern says Christchurch killer should remain \u2018nameless\u2019\nNew Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has vowed never to speak the name of the suspect in the Christchurch massacre, and instead urged the public to remember the names of his victims. Ardern, who has been widely praised for her strong and sensitive leadership in the aftermath of the attacks, began her address to the country\u2019s parliament on Tuesday with the Arabic greeting \u201cas-salaam Alaikum\u201d, and said the killer \u201csought notoriety but we, in New Zealand, will give nothing \u2013 not even his name\u201d.\nPresidential response. Donald Trump on Monday complained that the media were blaming him for the attacks, shortly before he described immigration in the US as an \u201cinvasion\u201d \u2013 a term used by the Christchurch suspect, Brenton Tarrant, in his manifesto.\nLiberians in the US facing possible deportation\nAn estimated 4,000 Liberians, who fled to the US in the 1990s during the civil war, are awaiting possible deportation by the Trump administration. Most arrived in the US after 1991 through deferred enforced departure, a temporary status that provides a work permit but no pathway to citizenship. Every administration since then has allowed them to remain, but last March they were told they had a year to \u201cget their affairs in order\u201d before leaving the US.\nLegal immigration. Trump-era policies such as extra in-person interviews and travel bans have made legal immigration to the US more difficult, as Alexandra Villareal reports.\nYemen deaths continue despite ceasefire agreement\nAt least three people are dying in Yemen every day as a result of continuing violence in the war-torn country, despite the ceasefire deal struck between Houthi rebels and the official Yemeni government in Stockholm in December. More than 231 civilians have been killed by airstrikes, shelling, snipers or landmines since the agreement was signed, many of them children.\nRising violence. While the number of deaths has reduced in Hodeidah governorate since the ceasefire, in other regions casualty numbers have gone up, more than doubling in the cities of Hajjah and Taiz, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council.\nCrib sheet\nMore than 1,000 people are feared dead after a catastrophic cyclone struck Mozambique last Friday. The country\u2019s environment minister said Tropical Cyclone Idai was \u201cthe biggest natural disaster Mozambique has ever faced\u201d.\nKevin Tsujihara, the chairman and CEO of Warner Bros, has resigned amid reports that he promised movie roles to a British actor with whom he was having an extramarital affair.\nBeto O\u2019Rourke raised $6.1m in contributions in the first 24 hours of his 2020 presidential campaign, smashing a record set by Bernie Sanders to reach a higher first-day total than any other Democratic contender.\nThe California town of Lake Elsinore has been so overrun by Instagrammers visiting its stunning annual poppy bloom that officials were forced temporarily to bar access to Walker Canyon, one of its most popular sites for poppy seekers.\nMust-reads\nThomas Heatherwick\u2019s $200m staircase to nowhere\nThe British designer Thomas Heatherwick has at last unveiled \u201cVessel\u201d, a $200m, 150ft-tall structure comprising 2,500 steps on 159 interconnecting flights of stairs in the heart of Manhattan\u2019s Hudson Yards. Nadja Sayej joins him as his \u201cgiant shawarma\u201d opens to the public.\nWhy Israel is quietly cosying up to Gulf monarchies\nA resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict seems as distant as ever, yet Israel has somehow grown close to longstanding enemies such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It comes down to a shared animosity for Iran and the disruptive influence of Donald Trump, as Ian Black explains.\nThe progressive 2020 hopeful backed by Steve Bannon\nTulsi Gabbard seemed like a rising progressive star when she was elected to Congress in 2012. But as Tom McCarthy reports, her positions on issues such as Syria \u2013 not to mention her fans, who include Steve Bannon \u2013 have put her at odds with fellow Democrats as she pursues a 2020 presidential bid.\nCoyote fur is fashionable, but is it ethical?\nThe trade in coyote pelts is booming, thanks to the fad for expensive Canada Goose parkas. But animal protection advocates say coyote trapping is inhumane and unnecessary. Daniel McGraw talks to trappers in Ohio, while Dream McClinton tracks fashion victims in New York.\nOpinion\nNine months after the radical Five Star Movement and the far-right League formed a governing coalition, Italy is in a democratic emergency, says Roberto Saviano. Amid a climate of racist aggression and with journalists under threat, progressive politicians are too focused on their own differences to offer an alternative.\nWhen people speak in general terms of populism in relation to this government, they risk obscuring truly alarming facts on the ground with abstract political labels.\nSport\nChattanooga FC sold more than $500,000 in shares in a month to more than 2,000 \u201cowners\u201d around the world. Dave Caldwell asks whether the Tennessee soccer club has found a new way to build a fanbase.\nMore than 60,000 supporters saw Atl\u00e9tico Madrid take on their title rivals Barcelona at the Wanda Metropolitano on Sunday, a record for women\u2019s soccer. English clubs should take note of Spanish tactics, says Suzanne Wrack.\nSign up\nThe US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

Note what she left out, though: the &ldquo;<em>vici</em>&rdquo; or victory part. And how right she was to do so, since Washington&rsquo;s invasions, occupations, and interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and elsewhere in this century have never produced anything faintly like a single decisive and <a href=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176520/\">lasting victory</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Failure is not an option&rdquo; was the stirring 1995 movie catchphrase for the dramatic 1970 rescue of the Apollo 13 moon mission and crew, but were such a movie to be made about America&rsquo;s wars and their less-than-<em>vici</em>-esque results today, the phrase would have to be corrected in Clintonian fashion to read &ldquo;We came, we saw, we failed.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/bbad3f17-7bc8-4cd2-95de-b353cb660b4b/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=770&height=433\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/4123dc24-a980-4322-a741-1017640965e1/759.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=361&width=642\"></img></figure>\n<p>Wars are risky, destructive, unpredictable endeavors, so it would hardly be surprising if America&rsquo;s military and civilian leaders failed occasionally in their endless martial endeavors, despite the overwhelming superiority in firepower of &ldquo;the <a href=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175337/tomgram:_william_astore,_we're_number_one_(in_self-promotion)/\">world&rsquo;s greatest</a> military.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s the question, though: Why have all the American wars of this century gone down in flames and what in the world have those leaders learned from such repetitive failures?</p>\n<p>The evidence before our eyes suggests that, when it comes to our senior military leaders at least, the answer would be: nothing at all.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with Gen. David Petraeus, he of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_troop_surge_of_2007\">the surge</a>&rdquo; fame in the Iraq War. Of course, he would briefly fall from grace <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2012/11/09/politics/petraeus-cia-resignation/index.html\">in 2012</a>, while director of the CIA, thanks to an affair with his biographer with whom he inappropriately shared highly classified information. When <a href=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/174845/astore_on_a_military_bemedaled_bothered_and_beleaguered\">riding high</a> in Iraq in 2007, however, &ldquo;King David&rdquo; (as he was then dubbed) was widely considered an example of America&rsquo;s best and brightest. He was a soldier-scholar with a doctorate from Princeton, an &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Insurgents-David-Petraeus-Change-American-ebook/dp/B008J4RONU\">insurgent</a>&rdquo; general with the perfect way&mdash;a revival of Vietnam War&ndash;era counterinsurgency techniques&mdash;to stabilize invaded and occupied Iraq. He was the man to snatch victory from the jaws of looming defeat. (Talk about a fable not worthy of Aesop!)</p>\n<p>Though retired from the military since 2011, Petraeus somehow remains a bellwether for conventional thinking about America&rsquo;s wars at the Pentagon, as well as inside the Washington Beltway. And despite the quagmire in Afghanistan (that he had a significant hand in deepening), despite the widespread destruction in Iraq (for which he would hold some responsibility), despite the failed-state chaos in Libya, he continues to relentlessly plug the idea of pursuing a &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; forever war against global terrorism; in other words, yet more of the same.</p>\n<aside><figure><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cover0217.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\">View our current issue</a></figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how he typically put it in a <a href=\"https://othjournal.com/2019/02/11/gen-petraeus-exclusive-on-emerging-threats-negotiating-with-the-taliban-and-more/\">recent interview</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I would contend that the fight against Islamist extremists is not one that we&rsquo;re going to see the end of in our lifetimes probably. I think this is a generational struggle, which requires you to have a sustained commitment. But of course you can only sustain it if it&rsquo;s sustainable in terms of the expenditure of blood and treasure.</p></blockquote>\n<p>His comment brings to mind a World War II quip about Gen. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Patton\">George S. Patton</a>, also known as &ldquo;Old Blood and Guts.&rdquo; Some of his troops responded to that nickname this way: Yes, his guts, but our blood. When men like Petraeus measure the supposed sustainability of their wars in terms of blood and treasure, the first question should be: Whose blood, whose treasure?</p>\n<p>When it comes to Washington&rsquo;s Afghan War, now in its 18th year and looking ever more like a demoralizing defeat, Petraeus admits that US forces &ldquo;never had an exit strategy.&rdquo; What they did have, he claims, &ldquo;was a strategy to allow us to continue to achieve our objectives&hellip;with the reduced expenditure in blood and treasure.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Think of this formulation as an upside-down version of the notorious &ldquo;body count&rdquo; of the Vietnam War. Instead of attempting to maximize enemy dead, as Gen. William Westmoreland sought to do from 1965 to 1968, Petraeus is suggesting that the United States seek to keep the American body count to a minimum (translating into minimal attention back home), while minimizing the &ldquo;treasure&rdquo; spent. By keeping American bucks and body bags down (Afghans <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47005558\">be damned</a>), the war, he insists, can be sustained not just for a few more years but generationally. (He cites 70-year troop commitments to NATO and South Korea as reasonable models.)</p>\n<p>Talk about lacking an exit strategy! And he also speaks of a persistent &ldquo;industrial-strength&rdquo; Afghan insurgency without noting that US military actions, including drone strikes and an <a href=\"https://www.stripes.com/news/the-us-has-dropped-more-munitions-in-2018-in-afghanistan-than-it-has-in-any-year-in-over-a-decade-1.558577\">increasing reliance</a> on air power, result in ever more <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/10/asia/afghanistan-airstrikes-civilian-deaths-un-report-intl/index.html\">dead civilians</a>, which only feed that same insurgency. For him, Afghanistan is little more than a &ldquo;platform&rdquo; for regional counterterror operations and so anything must be done to prevent the greatest horror of all: withdrawing American troops too quickly.</p>\n<p>In fact, he suggests that American-trained and supplied Iraqi forces <a href=\"https://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175907/tomgram%3A_william_astore%2C_america%27s_hollow_foreign_legions/\">collapsed</a> in 2014, when attacked by relatively small groups of ISIS militants, exactly because US troops had been withdrawn too quickly. The same, he has no doubt, will happen if President Trump repeats this &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; in Afghanistan. (Poor showings by US-trained forces are never, of course, evidence of a bankrupt approach in Washington, but of the need to &ldquo;stay the course.&rdquo;)</p>\n<p>Petraeus&rsquo;s critique is, in fact, a subtle version of the <a href=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/174859\">stab-in-the-back</a> myth. Its underlying premise: that the US military is always on the generational cusp of success, whether in Vietnam in 1971, Iraq in 2011, or Afghanistan in 2019, if only the rug weren&rsquo;t pulled out from under the US military by irresolute commanders-in-chief.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is all nonsense. Commanded by none other than Gen. David Petraeus, the Afghan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/30/obama-troops-afghanistan\">surge</a> of 2009&ndash;10 proved a dismal failure as, in the end, had his Iraq surge of 2007. US efforts to train reliable indigenous forces (no matter where in the embattled Greater Middle East and Africa) have also consistently failed. Yet Petraeus&rsquo;s answer is always more of the same: more US troops and advisers, training, bombing, and killing, all to be repeated at &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; levels for generations to come.</p>\n<p>The alternative, he suggests, is too awful to contemplate:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You have to do something about [Islamic extremism] because otherwise they&rsquo;re going to spew violence, extremism, instability, and a tsunami of refugees not just into neighboring countries but&hellip;into our western European allies, undermining their domestic political situations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>No mention here of how the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq spread destruction and, in the end, a &ldquo;tsunami of refugees&rdquo; throughout the region. No mention of how US interventions and bombing in Libya, Syria, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/us/politics/us-somalia-airstrikes-shabab.html\">Somalia</a>, and elsewhere help &ldquo;spew&rdquo; violence and generate a series of failed states.</p>\n<p>And amazingly enough, despite his lack of &ldquo;<em>vici</em>&rdquo; moments, the American media still <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/petraeus-afghan-war-generational-struggle-will-not-end-soon\">sees</a> King David as the go-to guy for advice on how to fight and win the wars he&rsquo;s had such a hand in losing. And just in case you want to start worrying a little, he&rsquo;s now offering such advice on even more dangerous matters. He&rsquo;s started to comment on the new &ldquo;cold war&rdquo; that now has Washington abuzz, a coming era&mdash;as he <a href=\"https://othjournal.com/2019/02/11/gen-petraeus-exclusive-on-emerging-threats-negotiating-with-the-taliban-and-more/\">puts it</a>&mdash;of &ldquo;renewed great power rivalries&rdquo; with China and Russia, an era, in fact, of &ldquo;multi-domain warfare&rdquo; that could prove far more challenging than &ldquo;the asymmetric abilities of the terrorists and extremists and insurgents that we&rsquo;ve countered in Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan and a variety of other places, particularly since 9/11.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For Petraeus, even if Islamic terrorism disappeared tomorrow and not generations from now, the US military would still be engaged with the supercharged threat of China and Russia. I can already hear Pentagon cash registers going ka-ching!</p>\n<p>And here, in the end, is what&rsquo;s most striking about Petraeus&rsquo;s war lessons: No concept of peace even exists in his version of the future. Instead, whether via Islamic terrorism or rival great powers, America faces intractable threats into a distant future. Give him credit for one thing: If adopted, his vision could keep the national security state funded in the staggering fashion it&rsquo;s come to expect for generations, or at least until the money runs out and the US empire collapses.</p>\n<p><strong>Two Senior Generals Draw Lessons from the Iraq War</strong></p>\n<p>David Petraeus remains America&rsquo;s best-known general of this century. His thinking, though, is anything but unique. Take two other senior US Army generals, Mark Milley and Ray Odierno, both of whom recently contributed forewords to the Army&rsquo;s official history of the Iraq War that tell you what you need to know about Pentagon thinking these days.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-armys-official-iraq-war-history-truth-telling-or-mythmaking/\">Published</a> this January, the Army&rsquo;s history of Operation Iraqi Freedom is detailed and controversial. Completed in June 2016, its publication was pushed back due to internal disagreements. As <em>The Wall Street Journal </em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-army-ordered-an-unvarnished-iraq-war-historythen-let-it-languish-1540220153\">put it</a> in October 2018: &ldquo;Senior [Army] brass fretted over the impact the study&rsquo;s criticisms might have on prominent officers&rsquo; reputations and on congressional support for the service.&rdquo; With those worries apparently resolved, the study is now available at the Army War College <a href=\"https://publications.armywarcollege.edu/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>The Iraq War witnessed the overthrow of autocrat (and former US ally) Saddam Hussein, a speedy declaration of &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/10-years-later-mission-accomplished\">mission accomplished</a>&rdquo; by President George W. Bush, and that country&rsquo;s subsequent descent into occupation, insurgency, civil war, and chaos. What should the Army have learned from all this? General Milley, now Army chief of staff and President Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_A._Milley\">nominee</a> to serve as the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, is explicit on its lessons:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;OIF [Operation Iraqi Freedom] is a sober reminder that technological advantages and standoff weapons alone cannot render a decision; that the promise of short wars is often elusive; that the ends, ways, and means must be in balance; that our Army must understand the type of war we are engaged with in order to adapt as necessary; that decisions in war occur on the ground in the mud and dirt; and that timeless factors such as human agency, chance, and an enemy&rsquo;s conviction, all shape a war&rsquo;s outcome.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>These aren&rsquo;t, in fact, lessons. They&rsquo;re military banalities. The side with the best weapons doesn&rsquo;t always win. Short wars can turn into long ones. The enemy has a say in how the war is fought. What they lack is any sense of Army responsibility for mismanaging the Iraq War so spectacularly. In other words, mission accomplished for General Milley.</p>\n<p>General Odierno, who commissioned the study and served in Iraq for 55 months, spills yet more ink in arguing, like Milley, that the Army has learned from its mistakes and adapted, becoming even more agile and lethal. Here&rsquo;s my summary of his &ldquo;lessons&rdquo;:</p>\n<p>* Superior technology doesn&rsquo;t guarantee victory. Skill and warcraft remain vital.</p>\n<p>* To win a war of occupation, soldiers need to know the environment, including &ldquo;the local political and social consequences of our actions.&hellip; When conditions on the ground change, we must be willing to reexamine the assumptions that underpin our strategy and plans and change course if necessary, no matter how painful it may be,&rdquo; while developing better &ldquo;strategic leaders.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>* The Army needs to be enlarged further because &ldquo;landpower&rdquo; is so vital and America&rsquo;s troops were &ldquo;overtaxed by the commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the decision to limit our troop levels in both theaters had severe operational consequences.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>* The Iraq War showcased an Army with an &ldquo;astonishing&rdquo; capacity &ldquo;to learn and adapt in the midst of a war that the United States was well on its way to losing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The gist of Odierno&rsquo;s &ldquo;lessons&rdquo;: The Army learned, adapted, and overcame. Therefore, it deserves America&rsquo;s thanks and yet more of everything, including the money and resources to pursue future wars even more successfully. There would, however, be another way to read those lessons of his: that the Army overvalued technology, that combat skills were lacking, that efforts to work with allies and Iraqi forces regularly failed, that Army leadership lacked the skills needed to win, and that it was folly to get into a global war on terror in the first place.</p>\n<p>On those failings, neither Milley nor Odierno has anything of value to say, since their focus is purely on how to make the Army prevail in future versions of just such wars. Their <a href=\"https://bracingviews.com/2013/07/26/the-u-s-militarys-limited-critique-of-itself-ensures-future-disasters/\">limited critique</a>, in short, does little to prevent future disasters. Much like Petraeus&rsquo;s reflections, they cannot envision an end point to the process&mdash;no victory to be celebrated, no return to America being &ldquo;a <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-good-neocon/\">normal country</a> in a normal time.&rdquo; There is only war and more war in their (and so our) future.</p>\n<p><strong>The Undiscovered Country</strong></p>\n<p>Talk of such future wars&mdash;of, that is, more of the same&mdash;reminded me of the sixth <em>Star Trek </em>movie, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_VI%3A_The_Undiscovered_Country\"><em>The Undiscovered Country</em></a>. In that space opera, which appeared in 1991 just as the Soviet Union was imploding, peace finally breaks out between the quasi-democratic Federation (think: the USA) and the warmongering Klingon Empire (think: the USSR). Even the Federation&rsquo;s implacable warrior-captain, James T. Kirk, grudgingly learns to bury the phaser with the Klingon &ldquo;bastards&rdquo; who murdered his son.</p>\n<p>Back then, I was a young captain in the US Air Force and, with the apparent end of the Cold War, my colleagues and I dared talk about, if not eternal peace, at least &ldquo;peace&rdquo; as our own&mdash;and not just <em>Star Trek</em>&rsquo;s&mdash;undiscovered country. Like many at the time, even we in the military were looking forward to what was then called a &ldquo;peace dividend.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But that unknown land, which Americans then glimpsed ever so briefly, remains unexplored to this day. The reason why is simple enough. As Andrew Bacevich put it in his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250055385/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20\"><em>Breach of Trust</em></a>, &ldquo;For the Pentagon [in 1991], peace posed a concrete and imminent threat&rdquo;&mdash;which meant that new threats, &ldquo;rogue states&rdquo; of every sort, had to be found. And found they were.</p>\n<p>It comes as no surprise, then, that America&rsquo;s generals have learned so little of real value from their 21st-century losses. They continue to see a state of &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176433/tomgram%3A_andrew_bacevich%2C_not_so_great_wars%2C_theirs_and_ours\">infinite war</a>&rdquo; as necessary and are blind to the ways in which endless war and the ever-developing war state in Washington are the enemies of democracy.</p>\n<p>The question isn&rsquo;t why they think the way they do. The question is why so many Americans share their vision. The future is now. Isn&rsquo;t it time that the United States sought to invade and occupy a different &ldquo;land&rdquo; entirely: an undiscovered country&mdash;a future&mdash;defined by peace?</p>",

                "text": "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.\n\u201cVeni, Vidi, Vici,\u201d boasted Julius Caesar, one of history\u2019s great military captains. \u201cI came, I saw, I conquered.\u201d\nThen\u2013Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed that famed saying when summing up the Obama administration\u2019s military intervention in Libya in 2011\u2014with a small alteration. \u201cWe came, we saw, he died,\u201d she said with a laugh about the killing of Moammar Gadhafi, that country\u2019s autocratic leader. Note what she left out, though: the \u201cvici\u201d or victory part. And how right she was to do so, since Washington\u2019s invasions, occupations, and interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and elsewhere in this century have never produced anything faintly like a single decisive and lasting victory.\n\u201cFailure is not an option\u201d was the stirring 1995 movie catchphrase for the dramatic 1970 rescue of the Apollo 13 moon mission and crew, but were such a movie to be made about America\u2019s wars and their less-than-vici-esque results today, the phrase would have to be corrected in Clintonian fashion to read \u201cWe came, we saw, we failed.\u201d\nWars are risky, destructive, unpredictable endeavors, so it would hardly be surprising if America\u2019s military and civilian leaders failed occasionally in their endless martial endeavors, despite the overwhelming superiority in firepower of \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest military.\u201d Here\u2019s the question, though: Why have all the American wars of this century gone down in flames and what in the world have those leaders learned from such repetitive failures?\nThe evidence before our eyes suggests that, when it comes to our senior military leaders at least, the answer would be: nothing at all.\nLet\u2019s begin with Gen. David Petraeus, he of \u201cthe surge\u201d fame in the Iraq War. Of course, he would briefly fall from grace in 2012, while director of the CIA, thanks to an affair with his biographer with whom he inappropriately shared highly classified information. When riding high in Iraq in 2007, however, \u201cKing David\u201d (as he was then dubbed) was widely considered an example of America\u2019s best and brightest. He was a soldier-scholar with a doctorate from Princeton, an \u201cinsurgent\u201d general with the perfect way\u2014a revival of Vietnam War\u2013era counterinsurgency techniques\u2014to stabilize invaded and occupied Iraq. He was the man to snatch victory from the jaws of looming defeat. (Talk about a fable not worthy of Aesop!)\nThough retired from the military since 2011, Petraeus somehow remains a bellwether for conventional thinking about America\u2019s wars at the Pentagon, as well as inside the Washington Beltway. And despite the quagmire in Afghanistan (that he had a significant hand in deepening), despite the widespread destruction in Iraq (for which he would hold some responsibility), despite the failed-state chaos in Libya, he continues to relentlessly plug the idea of pursuing a \u201csustainable\u201d forever war against global terrorism; in other words, yet more of the same.\nHere\u2019s how he typically put it in a recent interview:\nI would contend that the fight against Islamist extremists is not one that we\u2019re going to see the end of in our lifetimes probably. I think this is a generational struggle, which requires you to have a sustained commitment. But of course you can only sustain it if it\u2019s sustainable in terms of the expenditure of blood and treasure.\nHis comment brings to mind a World War II quip about Gen. George S. Patton, also known as \u201cOld Blood and Guts.\u201d Some of his troops responded to that nickname this way: Yes, his guts, but our blood. When men like Petraeus measure the supposed sustainability of their wars in terms of blood and treasure, the first question should be: Whose blood, whose treasure?\nWhen it comes to Washington\u2019s Afghan War, now in its 18th year and looking ever more like a demoralizing defeat, Petraeus admits that US forces \u201cnever had an exit strategy.\u201d What they did have, he claims, \u201cwas a strategy to allow us to continue to achieve our objectives\u2026with the reduced expenditure in blood and treasure.\u201d\nThink of this formulation as an upside-down version of the notorious \u201cbody count\u201d of the Vietnam War. Instead of attempting to maximize enemy dead, as Gen. William Westmoreland sought to do from 1965 to 1968, Petraeus is suggesting that the United States seek to keep the American body count to a minimum (translating into minimal attention back home), while minimizing the \u201ctreasure\u201d spent. By keeping American bucks and body bags down (Afghans be damned), the war, he insists, can be sustained not just for a few more years but generationally. (He cites 70-year troop commitments to NATO and South Korea as reasonable models.)\nTalk about lacking an exit strategy! And he also speaks of a persistent \u201cindustrial-strength\u201d Afghan insurgency without noting that US military actions, including drone strikes and an increasing reliance on air power, result in ever more dead civilians, which only feed that same insurgency. For him, Afghanistan is little more than a \u201cplatform\u201d for regional counterterror operations and so anything must be done to prevent the greatest horror of all: withdrawing American troops too quickly.\nIn fact, he suggests that American-trained and supplied Iraqi forces collapsed in 2014, when attacked by relatively small groups of ISIS militants, exactly because US troops had been withdrawn too quickly. The same, he has no doubt, will happen if President Trump repeats this \u201cmistake\u201d in Afghanistan. (Poor showings by US-trained forces are never, of course, evidence of a bankrupt approach in Washington, but of the need to \u201cstay the course.\u201d)\nPetraeus\u2019s critique is, in fact, a subtle version of the stab-in-the-back myth. Its underlying premise: that the US military is always on the generational cusp of success, whether in Vietnam in 1971, Iraq in 2011, or Afghanistan in 2019, if only the rug weren\u2019t pulled out from under the US military by irresolute commanders-in-chief.\nOf course, this is all nonsense. Commanded by none other than Gen. David Petraeus, the Afghan surge of 2009\u201310 proved a dismal failure as, in the end, had his Iraq surge of 2007. US efforts to train reliable indigenous forces (no matter where in the embattled Greater Middle East and Africa) have also consistently failed. Yet Petraeus\u2019s answer is always more of the same: more US troops and advisers, training, bombing, and killing, all to be repeated at \u201csustainable\u201d levels for generations to come.\nThe alternative, he suggests, is too awful to contemplate:\n\u201cYou have to do something about [Islamic extremism] because otherwise they\u2019re going to spew violence, extremism, instability, and a tsunami of refugees not just into neighboring countries but\u2026into our western European allies, undermining their domestic political situations.\u201d\nNo mention here of how the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq spread destruction and, in the end, a \u201ctsunami of refugees\u201d throughout the region. No mention of how US interventions and bombing in Libya, Syria, Somalia, and elsewhere help \u201cspew\u201d violence and generate a series of failed states.\nAnd amazingly enough, despite his lack of \u201cvici\u201d moments, the American media still sees King David as the go-to guy for advice on how to fight and win the wars he\u2019s had such a hand in losing. And just in case you want to start worrying a little, he\u2019s now offering such advice on even more dangerous matters. He\u2019s started to comment on the new \u201ccold war\u201d that now has Washington abuzz, a coming era\u2014as he puts it\u2014of \u201crenewed great power rivalries\u201d with China and Russia, an era, in fact, of \u201cmulti-domain warfare\u201d that could prove far more challenging than \u201cthe asymmetric abilities of the terrorists and extremists and insurgents that we\u2019ve countered in Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan and a variety of other places, particularly since 9/11.\u201d\nFor Petraeus, even if Islamic terrorism disappeared tomorrow and not generations from now, the US military would still be engaged with the supercharged threat of China and Russia. I can already hear Pentagon cash registers going ka-ching!\nAnd here, in the end, is what\u2019s most striking about Petraeus\u2019s war lessons: No concept of peace even exists in his version of the future. Instead, whether via Islamic terrorism or rival great powers, America faces intractable threats into a distant future. Give him credit for one thing: If adopted, his vision could keep the national security state funded in the staggering fashion it\u2019s come to expect for generations, or at least until the money runs out and the US empire collapses.\nTwo Senior Generals Draw Lessons from the Iraq War\nDavid Petraeus remains America\u2019s best-known general of this century. His thinking, though, is anything but unique. Take two other senior US Army generals, Mark Milley and Ray Odierno, both of whom recently contributed forewords to the Army\u2019s official history of the Iraq War that tell you what you need to know about Pentagon thinking these days.\nPublished this January, the Army\u2019s history of Operation Iraqi Freedom is detailed and controversial. Completed in June 2016, its publication was pushed back due to internal disagreements. As The Wall Street Journal put it in October 2018: \u201cSenior [Army] brass fretted over the impact the study\u2019s criticisms might have on prominent officers\u2019 reputations and on congressional support for the service.\u201d With those worries apparently resolved, the study is now available at the Army War College website.\nThe Iraq War witnessed the overthrow of autocrat (and former US ally) Saddam Hussein, a speedy declaration of \u201cmission accomplished\u201d by President George W. Bush, and that country\u2019s subsequent descent into occupation, insurgency, civil war, and chaos. What should the Army have learned from all this? General Milley, now Army chief of staff and President Trump\u2019s nominee to serve as the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, is explicit on its lessons:\n\u201cOIF [Operation Iraqi Freedom] is a sober reminder that technological advantages and standoff weapons alone cannot render a decision; that the promise of short wars is often elusive; that the ends, ways, and means must be in balance; that our Army must understand the type of war we are engaged with in order to adapt as necessary; that decisions in war occur on the ground in the mud and dirt; and that timeless factors such as human agency, chance, and an enemy\u2019s conviction, all shape a war\u2019s outcome.\u201d\nThese aren\u2019t, in fact, lessons. They\u2019re military banalities. The side with the best weapons doesn\u2019t always win. Short wars can turn into long ones. The enemy has a say in how the war is fought. What they lack is any sense of Army responsibility for mismanaging the Iraq War so spectacularly. In other words, mission accomplished for General Milley.\nGeneral Odierno, who commissioned the study and served in Iraq for 55 months, spills yet more ink in arguing, like Milley, that the Army has learned from its mistakes and adapted, becoming even more agile and lethal. Here\u2019s my summary of his \u201clessons\u201d:\n* Superior technology doesn\u2019t guarantee victory. Skill and warcraft remain vital.\n* To win a war of occupation, soldiers need to know the environment, including \u201cthe local political and social consequences of our actions.\u2026 When conditions on the ground change, we must be willing to reexamine the assumptions that underpin our strategy and plans and change course if necessary, no matter how painful it may be,\u201d while developing better \u201cstrategic leaders.\u201d\n* The Army needs to be enlarged further because \u201clandpower\u201d is so vital and America\u2019s troops were \u201covertaxed by the commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the decision to limit our troop levels in both theaters had severe operational consequences.\u201d\n* The Iraq War showcased an Army with an \u201castonishing\u201d capacity \u201cto learn and adapt in the midst of a war that the United States was well on its way to losing.\u201d\nThe gist of Odierno\u2019s \u201clessons\u201d: The Army learned, adapted, and overcame. Therefore, it deserves America\u2019s thanks and yet more of everything, including the money and resources to pursue future wars even more successfully. There would, however, be another way to read those lessons of his: that the Army overvalued technology, that combat skills were lacking, that efforts to work with allies and Iraqi forces regularly failed, that Army leadership lacked the skills needed to win, and that it was folly to get into a global war on terror in the first place.\nOn those failings, neither Milley nor Odierno has anything of value to say, since their focus is purely on how to make the Army prevail in future versions of just such wars. Their limited critique, in short, does little to prevent future disasters. Much like Petraeus\u2019s reflections, they cannot envision an end point to the process\u2014no victory to be celebrated, no return to America being \u201ca normal country in a normal time.\u201d There is only war and more war in their (and so our) future.\nThe Undiscovered Country\nTalk of such future wars\u2014of, that is, more of the same\u2014reminded me of the sixth Star Trek movie, The Undiscovered Country. In that space opera, which appeared in 1991 just as the Soviet Union was imploding, peace finally breaks out between the quasi-democratic Federation (think: the USA) and the warmongering Klingon Empire (think: the USSR). Even the Federation\u2019s implacable warrior-captain, James T. Kirk, grudgingly learns to bury the phaser with the Klingon \u201cbastards\u201d who murdered his son.\nBack then, I was a young captain in the US Air Force and, with the apparent end of the Cold War, my colleagues and I dared talk about, if not eternal peace, at least \u201cpeace\u201d as our own\u2014and not just Star Trek\u2019s\u2014undiscovered country. Like many at the time, even we in the military were looking forward to what was then called a \u201cpeace dividend.\u201d\nBut that unknown land, which Americans then glimpsed ever so briefly, remains unexplored to this day. The reason why is simple enough. As Andrew Bacevich put it in his book Breach of Trust, \u201cFor the Pentagon [in 1991], peace posed a concrete and imminent threat\u201d\u2014which meant that new threats, \u201crogue states\u201d of every sort, had to be found. And found they were.\nIt comes as no surprise, then, that America\u2019s generals have learned so little of real value from their 21st-century losses. They continue to see a state of \u201cinfinite war\u201d as necessary and are blind to the ways in which endless war and the ever-developing war state in Washington are the enemies of democracy.\nThe question isn\u2019t why they think the way they do. The question is why so many Americans share their vision. The future is now. Isn\u2019t it time that the United States sought to invade and occupy a different \u201cland\u201d entirely: an undiscovered country\u2014a future\u2014defined by peace?",

Two weeks earlier, president Andr&eacute;s Manuel L&oacute;pez Obrador had announced that Mexico&rsquo;s war against narcotrafficking was over. &ldquo;There is no war. We want peace, we&rsquo;re going to get peace,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/conferencia-de-prensa-del-presidente-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-30-de-enero-de-2019\">he&rsquo;d told reporters in his daily morning press conference</a>. For communities like the displaced from Guerrero, Mexico&rsquo;s war on drugs is alive and well. The hand-lettered posters around their tent encampment detailed their complaints: &ldquo;In Guerrero there is no guarantee of anything. It&rsquo;s a narco state.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Since then-President Felipe Calderon first announced Mexico&rsquo;s war against drugs in 2006, military deployment in states with a strong cartel presence has dramatically altered the life of Mexicans. In Guerrero, home to many of the country&rsquo;s opium fields, hundreds of people have been displaced as a result of turf wars and corruption, as gangs and traffickers have colluded with security forces and government officials.</p>\n<p>Manuel Olivares, the director of a Mexican human-rights center that has been providing support to the displaced people from Guerrero, says the situation is the result of the drug war&rsquo;s deployment of the military in the streets: o<a href=\"https://nacla.org/news/2018/02/15/green-blue-mexican-security-state\">ver 600,000 troops have been deployed across Mexico</a> to fight narcos.

Instead of the militarization that characterized his predecessors, L&oacute;pez Obrador has largely advocated for peace building and transitional justice, even speaking about the possibility of amnesty for narcotraffickers during his presidential campaign. In November, L&oacute;pez Obrador presented his National <a href=\"https://lopezobrador.org.mx/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/PLAN-DE-PAZ-Y-SEGURIDAD_ANEXO.pdf\">Peace and Security Plan</a> that plans to &ldquo;reformulate the combat of drugs&rdquo; through changing structures of penalization of drugs, address impunity of state actors, reorient national security strategies and seek justice for victims of drug war-related violence. In presenting the plan, the president discussed the need to &ldquo;begin a peace process with organized crime organizations and adopt models of transitional justice that guarantee the rights of victims.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Such a change in approach could mean moving from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/4/18/11403106/ungass-war-on-drugs\">the prohibition and criminalization that has defined drug policy worldwide since the 1960s</a>. Zara Snapp, the founder of drug research and advocacy organization Instituto RIA, sees L&oacute;pez Obrador&rsquo;s declaration as primarily a shift in strategy. &ldquo;It means they aren&rsquo;t going after the big capos anymore,&rdquo; she explains. But while the war against the narcotraffickers has ended, she argues, &ldquo;the government also needs to end the war against the people.&rdquo; That includes everyone from families of disappeared people, to people displaced by turf wars, to drug users and small-scale producers.</p>\n<p>L&oacute;pez Obrador has also announced a new <a href=\"https://noticieros.televisa.com/ultimas-noticias/amlo-gobierno-presenta-plan-busqueda-personas-desaparecidas/\">Plan for Search of Disappeared People, with an allocation of $2 million</a> to investigate the cases of the 40,000-some disappearances since the start of the drug war. Amaya Ordorika, who advocates for sensible drug policy and the end of the drug war with the nonprofit group ReverdeSer Colectivo, says the new plan could be a step towards repairing some of the harm of the drug war. Historically, families of disappeared people have faced, at best, a lack of capacity and institutional will in investigating their cases, and at worst, corruption and complicity of authorities in forced disappearance.</p>\n<aside> <figure><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cover0217.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\">View our current issue</a></figcaption></figure> </aside>\n<p>Ordorika echoes that a new drug strategy ought to move from criminalizing the substances and illegal markets themselves, to centering the communities affected by the war on drugs. &ldquo;We talk about narcotrafficking and everyone imagines Chapo Guzman or the big cartels,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;but if we unpack the concept of narcotrafficking, a ton of people at different levels in the chain participate in different ways.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At the lowest end of the supply chain are small-scale farmers who cultivate poppy and marijuana, women who transport small amounts of drugs and small-scale sellers who tend to be people with few economic alternatives. &ldquo;These populations are over-criminalized,&rdquo; Ordorika says, as organized crime structures treat them as replaceable, and they lack the protection of powerful drug capos.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s another side to these developments: while L&oacute;pez Obrador has spoken in favor of demilitarization, NGOs and activists have criticized his implementation of a new National Guard because of its potential to heighten military presence. The original plan called for the body to comprise active members of the military, the federal police and military and naval police. A <a href=\"http://www.cmdpdh.org/publicaciones-pdf/cmdpdh-proposal-of-president-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-to-militarize-the-public-security.pdf\">report from the NGO Mexican Commission for Defense and Promotion of Human Rights (CMDPDH)</a> argues that the National Guard gives further license to the human rights violations that have occurred as a result of the drug war, and that it is contrary to the &ldquo;transitional justice process&rdquo; that L&oacute;pez Obrador has mentioned with respect to the drug war.</p>\n<p>The Senate eventually approved the measure <a href=\"https://www.animalpolitico.com/2019/02/guardia-nacional-caracter-civil-senado/\">under the condition that it remain under civil, rather than military, control</a>, but L&oacute;pez Obrador announced in April that the head of the National Guard <a href=\"https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/mexico/politica/presenta-amlo-al-estado-mayor-de-la-guardia-nacional-3307856.html\">would be a military general</a>. Catalina Perez Correa, a researcher at the Drug Policy Program at Mexico City&rsquo;s Center for Economic Research and Education (CIDE), says that the National Guard has the potential to go either way. &ldquo;It depends how it is implemented,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It could be an opportunity to reduce the damage that has been caused by militarization, unless AMLO uses it as an excuse to further militarize the country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Perez Correa says it is crucial for the administration to take steps toward regulating drug markets. <a href=\"https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/politica/Equipo-de-Lopez-Obrador-presento\u2014propuesta-para-legalizar-la-mariguana-en-Mexico-20181106-0109.html\">L&oacute;pez Obrador has insinuated in the past that he make take steps towards legalization of cannabis</a>, and Perez Correa emphasizes that violence reduction will depend on how cannabis is eventually regulated in Mexico. &ldquo;If it is a strategy that favors big capital, it&rsquo;s very possible that the violence will continue, with farmers obligated to plant drugs becoming exploited by big cannabis.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Snapp also argues that the end of the drug war should necessarily involve a de-stigmatization of drug use in general. &ldquo;We have to stop creating conditions where people who use drugs can be extorted by authorities and where resources from drug markets get to organized crime.&rdquo; Regulation, she says, should be a tool to rebuilt the social fabric in communities torn apart by the drug war. &ldquo;We can use regulation to repair the harm that prohibition has caused,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;For us, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a good regulation if they don&rsquo;t involve those who are today involved in the illegal market.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This means changing the conversation around drug addiction in general&mdash;a step that L&oacute;pez Obrador may not be willing to take.</p>\n<p>In mid-March, he proposed giving the church its own television and radio channels in order to transmit moral values to combat drug use. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough to say, my policies changed,&rdquo; says Ordorika. &ldquo;For decades, there was a public discourse, and you have to reverse the effects of that by implementing a new public discourse of repairing damages and social reconciliation of people who&rsquo;ve been marginalized, stigmatized, criminalized.&rdquo; For Ordorika, that new discourse should involve a framework focused on harm reduction, through initiatives like supervised injection sites and comprehensive drug education behind the just-say-no model.</p>\n<p>Mexico wouldn&rsquo;t be the first country to take an approach to drugs focused on harm-reduction and regulation rather than <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/4/18/11403106/ungass-war-on-drugs\">the prohibition and criminalization that has defined international drug policy since the 1960s</a>. In doing so, it would follow precedents set by Canada and Uruguay, who have fully legalized marijuana in spite of international drug treaties that prohibit countries from fully legalizing recreational drug use. &ldquo;Mexico now would be the third or fourth country [to change its approach to drugs], but Mexico would be the first country where we&rsquo;ve had this level of devastating consequences from prohibition.&rdquo; Snapp says, adding, &ldquo;I think Mexico has all the moral authority to talk about a paradigm shift.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Whatever its eventual details, a new drug policy for Mexico will also inevitably have severe consequences for its relationship with the United States. Washington has invested <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF10578.pdf\">up to $3 billion in Mexico&rsquo;s drug war</a> through the M&eacute;rida Initiative, a bilateral agreement made in 2007. Concurrent with the increased funding to the drug war, though, homicides and other violent crimes <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/10/05/mexico-militarization-public-security\">have only increased</a>. &ldquo;We are actually making an investment not in our security, but in our insecurity,&rdquo; says Snapp.</p>\n<p>The end of the drug war would mean the United States could choose to withhold aid, Ordorika says. Still, she sees it as an issue of international sovereignty: &ldquo;To what point does the neighboring country have the right to insert itself to the degree that the main problem comes from a policy implemented and financed by the neighboring country?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At the end of March, the displaced people from Guerrero finally <a href=\"https://www.animalpolitico.com/2019/03/desplazados-guerrero-dejan-cdmx-segob-promete-seguridad/\">came to an agreement with the Mexican government to return to their state</a>. For the time being, they can&rsquo;t return to their homes, and the government didn&rsquo;t fulfill their demands for resettlement, but they&rsquo;ve been temporarily housed in a municipal auditorium in the town of Chichihualco. As with the end of the drug war, it remains to be seen how the government will fulfill its promises for protection: whether it will fulfill the ideal of addressing abuses from the root, or whether it will merely reproduce the abuses of the past.</p>",

                "text": "Sign up for Take Action Now and get three actions in your inbox every week.\nOn February 17, some 300 people from the Mexican state of Guerrero set up camp outside of Mexico City\u2019s National Palace to pressure the government to address their forced displacement by drug gangs from their homes in the Sierra Madre. Two weeks earlier, president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador had announced that Mexico\u2019s war against narcotrafficking was over. \u201cThere is no war. We want peace, we\u2019re going to get peace,\u201d he\u2019d told reporters in his daily morning press conference. For communities like the displaced from Guerrero, Mexico\u2019s war on drugs is alive and well. The hand-lettered posters around their tent encampment detailed their complaints: \u201cIn Guerrero there is no guarantee of anything. It\u2019s a narco state.\u201d\nSince then-President Felipe Calderon first announced Mexico\u2019s war against drugs in 2006, military deployment in states with a strong cartel presence has dramatically altered the life of Mexicans. In Guerrero, home to many of the country\u2019s opium fields, hundreds of people have been displaced as a result of turf wars and corruption, as gangs and traffickers have colluded with security forces and government officials.\nManuel Olivares, the director of a Mexican human-rights center that has been providing support to the displaced people from Guerrero, says the situation is the result of the drug war\u2019s deployment of the military in the streets: over 600,000 troops have been deployed across Mexico to fight narcos. In some areas, Olivares says, state police and the army actively collaborate with gangs to manage gang territory.\n\u201cWhen the military was deployed, they hit some cartels in some states very hard,\u201d he explains. As a result, cartels fragmented into smaller gangs who began to fight increasingly bloody turf wars, resulting in entire communities being forced from their homes at gunpoint; over 200,000 people have been killed in the process, and around 40,000 people have been forcibly disappeared.\nPaco Taibo\u2019s Republic of Readers\nDuring his presidential campaign, L\u00f3pez Obrador insisted he\u2019d take a new approach to the drug war. Instead of the militarization that characterized his predecessors, L\u00f3pez Obrador has largely advocated for peace building and transitional justice, even speaking about the possibility of amnesty for narcotraffickers during his presidential campaign. In November, L\u00f3pez Obrador presented his National Peace and Security Plan that plans to \u201creformulate the combat of drugs\u201d through changing structures of penalization of drugs, address impunity of state actors, reorient national security strategies and seek justice for victims of drug war-related violence. In presenting the plan, the president discussed the need to \u201cbegin a peace process with organized crime organizations and adopt models of transitional justice that guarantee the rights of victims.\u201d\nSuch a change in approach could mean moving from the prohibition and criminalization that has defined drug policy worldwide since the 1960s. Zara Snapp, the founder of drug research and advocacy organization Instituto RIA, sees L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s declaration as primarily a shift in strategy. \u201cIt means they aren\u2019t going after the big capos anymore,\u201d she explains. But while the war against the narcotraffickers has ended, she argues, \u201cthe government also needs to end the war against the people.\u201d That includes everyone from families of disappeared people, to people displaced by turf wars, to drug users and small-scale producers.\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has also announced a new Plan for Search of Disappeared People, with an allocation of $2 million to investigate the cases of the 40,000-some disappearances since the start of the drug war. Amaya Ordorika, who advocates for sensible drug policy and the end of the drug war with the nonprofit group ReverdeSer Colectivo, says the new plan could be a step towards repairing some of the harm of the drug war. Historically, families of disappeared people have faced, at best, a lack of capacity and institutional will in investigating their cases, and at worst, corruption and complicity of authorities in forced disappearance.\nOrdorika echoes that a new drug strategy ought to move from criminalizing the substances and illegal markets themselves, to centering the communities affected by the war on drugs. \u201cWe talk about narcotrafficking and everyone imagines Chapo Guzman or the big cartels,\u201d she says, \u201cbut if we unpack the concept of narcotrafficking, a ton of people at different levels in the chain participate in different ways.\u201d\nAt the lowest end of the supply chain are small-scale farmers who cultivate poppy and marijuana, women who transport small amounts of drugs and small-scale sellers who tend to be people with few economic alternatives. \u201cThese populations are over-criminalized,\u201d Ordorika says, as organized crime structures treat them as replaceable, and they lack the protection of powerful drug capos.\nThere\u2019s another side to these developments: while L\u00f3pez Obrador has spoken in favor of demilitarization, NGOs and activists have criticized his implementation of a new National Guard because of its potential to heighten military presence. The original plan called for the body to comprise active members of the military, the federal police and military and naval police. A report from the NGO Mexican Commission for Defense and Promotion of Human Rights (CMDPDH) argues that the National Guard gives further license to the human rights violations that have occurred as a result of the drug war, and that it is contrary to the \u201ctransitional justice process\u201d that L\u00f3pez Obrador has mentioned with respect to the drug war.\nThe Senate eventually approved the measure under the condition that it remain under civil, rather than military, control, but L\u00f3pez Obrador announced in April that the head of the National Guard would be a military general. Catalina Perez Correa, a researcher at the Drug Policy Program at Mexico City\u2019s Center for Economic Research and Education (CIDE), says that the National Guard has the potential to go either way. \u201cIt depends how it is implemented,\u201d she says. \u201cIt could be an opportunity to reduce the damage that has been caused by militarization, unless AMLO uses it as an excuse to further militarize the country.\u201d\nPerez Correa says it is crucial for the administration to take steps toward regulating drug markets. L\u00f3pez Obrador has insinuated in the past that he make take steps towards legalization of cannabis, and Perez Correa emphasizes that violence reduction will depend on how cannabis is eventually regulated in Mexico. \u201cIf it is a strategy that favors big capital, it\u2019s very possible that the violence will continue, with farmers obligated to plant drugs becoming exploited by big cannabis.\u201d\nSnapp also argues that the end of the drug war should necessarily involve a de-stigmatization of drug use in general. \u201cWe have to stop creating conditions where people who use drugs can be extorted by authorities and where resources from drug markets get to organized crime.\u201d Regulation, she says, should be a tool to rebuilt the social fabric in communities torn apart by the drug war. \u201cWe can use regulation to repair the harm that prohibition has caused,\u201d she says. \u201cFor us, it wouldn\u2019t be a good regulation if they don\u2019t involve those who are today involved in the illegal market.\u201d\nThis means changing the conversation around drug addiction in general\u2014a step that L\u00f3pez Obrador may not be willing to take.\nIn mid-March, he proposed giving the church its own television and radio channels in order to transmit moral values to combat drug use. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to say, my policies changed,\u201d says Ordorika. \u201cFor decades, there was a public discourse, and you have to reverse the effects of that by implementing a new public discourse of repairing damages and social reconciliation of people who\u2019ve been marginalized, stigmatized, criminalized.\u201d For Ordorika, that new discourse should involve a framework focused on harm reduction, through initiatives like supervised injection sites and comprehensive drug education behind the just-say-no model.\nMexico wouldn\u2019t be the first country to take an approach to drugs focused on harm-reduction and regulation rather than the prohibition and criminalization that has defined international drug policy since the 1960s. In doing so, it would follow precedents set by Canada and Uruguay, who have fully legalized marijuana in spite of international drug treaties that prohibit countries from fully legalizing recreational drug use. \u201cMexico now would be the third or fourth country [to change its approach to drugs], but Mexico would be the first country where we\u2019ve had this level of devastating consequences from prohibition.\u201d Snapp says, adding, \u201cI think Mexico has all the moral authority to talk about a paradigm shift.\u201d\nWhatever its eventual details, a new drug policy for Mexico will also inevitably have severe consequences for its relationship with the United States. Washington has invested up to $3 billion in Mexico\u2019s drug war through the M\u00e9rida Initiative, a bilateral agreement made in 2007. Concurrent with the increased funding to the drug war, though, homicides and other violent crimes have only increased. \u201cWe are actually making an investment not in our security, but in our insecurity,\u201d says Snapp.\nThe end of the drug war would mean the United States could choose to withhold aid, Ordorika says. Still, she sees it as an issue of international sovereignty: \u201cTo what point does the neighboring country have the right to insert itself to the degree that the main problem comes from a policy implemented and financed by the neighboring country?\u201d\nAt the end of March, the displaced people from Guerrero finally came to an agreement with the Mexican government to return to their state. For the time being, they can\u2019t return to their homes, and the government didn\u2019t fulfill their demands for resettlement, but they\u2019ve been temporarily housed in a municipal auditorium in the town of Chichihualco. As with the end of the drug war, it remains to be seen how the government will fulfill its promises for protection: whether it will fulfill the ideal of addressing abuses from the root, or whether it will merely reproduce the abuses of the past.",

It is about Yemen, of course, but it is also about the role of Congress.

While there were a number of courageous Republicans in the House and the Senate who have worked with Sanders, Khanna, Pocan, and longtime advocates for restoration of this essential check and balance on the Executive Branch such as Congresswoman Barbara Lee, the votes on the Yemen measure generally split along party lines in both chambers.</p>\n<p>The president&rsquo;s veto forces an existential choice on members of Congress, no matter how they voted on the initial resolution. The House (with a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-votes-end-support-yemen-war-rebuffing-trump-n990966\">247-175</a> vote) and the Senate (with a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-poised-vote-withdrawal-yemen-war-n982991\">54-46</a> vote), have acted &ldquo;to direct the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized by Congress.&rdquo; Those majority votes were sufficient to pass the resolution, but the numbers are not sufficient to override Trump&rsquo;s veto&mdash;a move that requires <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/override_of_a_veto.htm\">two-thirds</a> support in each chamber.</p>\n<p>This is where advocates for a humanitarian response to the crisis in Yemen can and should make a constitutional appeal to members of the House and Senate who opposed the initial resolution.</p>\n<p>No matter where a member of either chamber, and of either party, may stand on the specific question of US engagement with Saudi Arabia and the crisis in Yemen, Trump&rsquo;s veto represents a rejection by a sitting president of the will of bipartisan majorities in a Republican-controlled Senate and a Democratic-controlled House on a matter of war and peace.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/16/trump-vetoes-resolution-yemen-civil-war-1278627\">veto</a> sets up a definitional question for members of both chambers.

                "text": "Congress never authorized the US military to support the brutal Saudi Arabian assault on Yemen, where Human Rights Watch warns that \u201cthe world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis\u201d is now unfolding. But President Trump, like his predecessors, has taken advantage of a decaying system of checks and balances to maintain that support. So Congress stepped up. To begin to address the crisis\u2014which has left 80 percent of the population, roughly 24 million people, struggling to survive\u2014the House and Senate have backed a measure to end support for the Saudi-led coalition that international observers accuse of engaging in unlawful attacks, torture, and other acts so horrific that they have inspired the global hashtag #YemenCantWait.\nTrump\u2019s response to this reassertion of the basic premises of the US Constitution came on Tuesday evening in the form of a veto and a claim that this congressional intervention represents \u201can unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s veto is wrong, on humanitarian and constitutional grounds.\n\u201cTrump has shamefully vetoed our bipartisan effort to end the unconstitutional US-Saudi war in Yemen, which has created the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis,\u201d declared Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Mark Pocan. \u201cCongress has sole authority over war. Despite this setback, we will bring this conflict to an end.\u201d\nTo do that, argues Congressman Ro Khanna, the California Democrat who has worked closely with Senator Bernie Sanders to secure congressional action on Yemen, \u201cWe must override his veto.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about both houses of Congress taking back our authority outlined in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution to decide on matters of war and peace,\u201d says Khanna. Senator Sanders shares this view, explaining that the congressional votes on Yemen represent \u201cthe beginning of a national debate over when and where we go to war and Congress\u2019s authority over those interventions.\u201d\nFor that debate to have meaning, the override vote must take on new meaning. It is about Yemen, of course, but it is also about the role of Congress. This is the point at which Congress can begin to restore checks and balances on issues of war and peace, which should be a priority for Democrats and Republicans who swear an oath to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic\u201d and to \u201cbear true faith and allegiance to the same.\u201d\nUnfortunately, too many members of both parties put partisanship ahead of a Constitution that grants the Congress\u2014not the president\u2014the power to declare wars and authorize military interventions and partnerships. While there were a number of courageous Republicans in the House and the Senate who have worked with Sanders, Khanna, Pocan, and longtime advocates for restoration of this essential check and balance on the Executive Branch such as Congresswoman Barbara Lee, the votes on the Yemen measure generally split along party lines in both chambers.\nThe president\u2019s veto forces an existential choice on members of Congress, no matter how they voted on the initial resolution. The House (with a 247-175 vote) and the Senate (with a 54-46 vote), have acted \u201cto direct the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized by Congress.\u201d Those majority votes were sufficient to pass the resolution, but the numbers are not sufficient to override Trump\u2019s veto\u2014a move that requires two-thirds support in each chamber.\nThis is where advocates for a humanitarian response to the crisis in Yemen can and should make a constitutional appeal to members of the House and Senate who opposed the initial resolution.\nNo matter where a member of either chamber, and of either party, may stand on the specific question of US engagement with Saudi Arabia and the crisis in Yemen, Trump\u2019s veto represents a rejection by a sitting president of the will of bipartisan majorities in a Republican-controlled Senate and a Democratic-controlled House on a matter of war and peace.\nThe veto sets up a definitional question for members of both chambers. They now must decide whether they want to preserve the separation of powers and the system of checks and balances as outlined in the Constitution, or to do the bidding of the imperial presidency.",

(Sipa via AP Images)</figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>It&rsquo;s 2019, and the Democratic Party is finally starting to energize voters. Gone are calls for cutting Social Security or one-upping Republicans in games of tax-cutting or warmongering. In their place are transformational ideas like Medicare for All, universal childcare, and a Green New Deal. Democratic candidates and elected officials are finally hearing the needs and wishes of their supporters, and acting accordingly.</p>\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s time for those of us in the consulting field, who work to help elect these leaders, to follow suit.</p>\n<p>While it&rsquo;s not well-known outside the political class, many consultants who advise campaigns are often working for corporate clients at the same time&mdash;and all too frequently, these clients interests&rsquo; directly oppose the goals of any progressive coalition. Those working both sides of the street include some of the most senior aides from the Obama administration, and as well as advisers to both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns. From opposing progressive taxation to fighting for deregulation, working for corporate clients means pushing an agenda most progressives would consider a non-starter were it espoused by a political candidate.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/bbad3f17-7bc8-4cd2-95de-b353cb660b4b/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=770&height=433\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/4123dc24-a980-4322-a741-1017640965e1/759.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=361&width=642\"></img></figure>\n<p>Many progressives recently criticized Bill Burton, a top Democratic consultant and former Obama aide, for working on former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz&rsquo;s independent presidential bid. Critics rightly worried that by helping Schultz direct massive resources against the Democratic nominee, Burton could swing the election over to Donald Trump. Besides, Schultz&rsquo;s agenda of opposing higher taxes on multimillionaires or Medicare for All is a direct attack on the progressive movement.</p>\n<p>However, to criticize Burton for working for Schultz while giving him and his previous firm, SKDK, a pass for advising and advancing corporate clients misses the larger picture. Why was it OK to push a conservative agenda for a corporation, but suddenly verboten to do so for a candidate? In both instances, the Democratic Party&rsquo;s top talent is working to undermine the party&rsquo;s progressive agenda. We can all do better.</p>\n<p>Obviously, consultants have a right to make a living&mdash;and like the rest of America, there are consultants struggling with debt, housing costs, and medical expenses. I am also aware that some of us are more fortunate than others, and better positioned to make the difficult choices of choosing which clients to accept. I certainly don&rsquo;t take for granted my own privilege, or consider myself perfect or blameless.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not writing this to condemn my colleagues or point the finger. What I am doing is stating a goal for myself that I hope others will consider. Let&rsquo;s change the way we do business, and agree from now on that working for corporations should no longer be business as usual for Democratic consultants.</p>\n<aside><figure><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cover0217.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\">View our current issue</a></figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>Now, this may sound like a page out of Jerry Maguire&rsquo;s mission statement: &ldquo;The things we think but do not say.&rdquo; But the fact is, these aren&rsquo;t normal times. Solutions daring enough to solve the problems we face, like a Green New Deal, aren&rsquo;t necessarily going to be &ldquo;business-friendly,&rdquo; and may not be endorsed by corporate America. Some consultants may&mdash;consciously or unconsciously&mdash;advise their candidates to take a softer stance on an issue because they can &ldquo;see it from the business side of things.&rdquo; How can we do that and even pretend to fight for the party&rsquo;s bedrock principles of economic fairness, racial justice, environmental protection, and affordable health care for all?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Consultant&rdquo; is a vague label, but the truth is that many of us on the Democratic side are veteran campaign and government staffers who wanted to settle down and raise our families. We are some of the most experienced operatives in the Democratic Party, which is all the more reason that we need to change the way we do business.</p>\n<p>If we really are the ones with the most experience in helping Democrats win, let&rsquo;s use that experience to ensure that progressive Democrats win. Because for the next two years, there is nothing more important than promoting a progressive agenda, electing Democrats, and stopping Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been working in politics for over 20 years, on campaigns as well as in government. I&rsquo;m proud of this work. But along every stop of my career, both in government and as a political adviser, the problems with the Democratic Party establishment have come into clearer focus: The establishment wants candidates who will support policies that preserve the status quo. For those of us who want progressive policies that are in fact overwhelmingly popular but stand in opposition to the status quo, it&rsquo;s vital that we work for causes and candidates who are untethered to that establishment. There are progressive candidates at every level of government&mdash;from school board to president. We haven&rsquo;t been invested in finding and electing them, but have found ourselves working for the established interests of corporations and the party.</p>\n<p>For decades now, Democrats have been apologizing for our beliefs. We&rsquo;ve bent over backward to and accommodate a Republican Party that has no interest in compromise, and we have settled for incremental gains instead of real victories. It&rsquo;s time for progressives to be smarter, fight harder, and win on our own terms.</p>\n<p>After all, if we want Democratic candidates to answer directly to the people they serve, we need to make sure that those advising them do the same. Let&rsquo;s all get on the same program, and fight to reclaim the promise of this country for those who need it most.</p>\n<p>The stakes have never been higher.</p>",

                "text": "It\u2019s 2019, and the Democratic Party is finally starting to energize voters. Gone are calls for cutting Social Security or one-upping Republicans in games of tax-cutting or warmongering. In their place are transformational ideas like Medicare for All, universal childcare, and a Green New Deal. Democratic candidates and elected officials are finally hearing the needs and wishes of their supporters, and acting accordingly.\nNow it\u2019s time for those of us in the consulting field, who work to help elect these leaders, to follow suit.\nWhile it\u2019s not well-known outside the political class, many consultants who advise campaigns are often working for corporate clients at the same time\u2014and all too frequently, these clients interests\u2019 directly oppose the goals of any progressive coalition. Those working both sides of the street include some of the most senior aides from the Obama administration, and as well as advisers to both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns. From opposing progressive taxation to fighting for deregulation, working for corporate clients means pushing an agenda most progressives would consider a non-starter were it espoused by a political candidate.\nMany progressives recently criticized Bill Burton, a top Democratic consultant and former Obama aide, for working on former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz\u2019s independent presidential bid. Critics rightly worried that by helping Schultz direct massive resources against the Democratic nominee, Burton could swing the election over to Donald Trump. Besides, Schultz\u2019s agenda of opposing higher taxes on multimillionaires or Medicare for All is a direct attack on the progressive movement.\nHowever, to criticize Burton for working for Schultz while giving him and his previous firm, SKDK, a pass for advising and advancing corporate clients misses the larger picture. Why was it OK to push a conservative agenda for a corporation, but suddenly verboten to do so for a candidate? In both instances, the Democratic Party\u2019s top talent is working to undermine the party\u2019s progressive agenda. We can all do better.\nObviously, consultants have a right to make a living\u2014and like the rest of America, there are consultants struggling with debt, housing costs, and medical expenses. I am also aware that some of us are more fortunate than others, and better positioned to make the difficult choices of choosing which clients to accept. I certainly don\u2019t take for granted my own privilege, or consider myself perfect or blameless.\nI\u2019m not writing this to condemn my colleagues or point the finger. What I am doing is stating a goal for myself that I hope others will consider. Let\u2019s change the way we do business, and agree from now on that working for corporations should no longer be business as usual for Democratic consultants.\nNow, this may sound like a page out of Jerry Maguire\u2019s mission statement: \u201cThe things we think but do not say.\u201d But the fact is, these aren\u2019t normal times. Solutions daring enough to solve the problems we face, like a Green New Deal, aren\u2019t necessarily going to be \u201cbusiness-friendly,\u201d and may not be endorsed by corporate America. Some consultants may\u2014consciously or unconsciously\u2014advise their candidates to take a softer stance on an issue because they can \u201csee it from the business side of things.\u201d How can we do that and even pretend to fight for the party\u2019s bedrock principles of economic fairness, racial justice, environmental protection, and affordable health care for all?\n\u201cConsultant\u201d is a vague label, but the truth is that many of us on the Democratic side are veteran campaign and government staffers who wanted to settle down and raise our families. We are some of the most experienced operatives in the Democratic Party, which is all the more reason that we need to change the way we do business.\nIf we really are the ones with the most experience in helping Democrats win, let\u2019s use that experience to ensure that progressive Democrats win. Because for the next two years, there is nothing more important than promoting a progressive agenda, electing Democrats, and stopping Donald Trump.\nI\u2019ve been working in politics for over 20 years, on campaigns as well as in government. I\u2019m proud of this work. But along every stop of my career, both in government and as a political adviser, the problems with the Democratic Party establishment have come into clearer focus: The establishment wants candidates who will support policies that preserve the status quo. For those of us who want progressive policies that are in fact overwhelmingly popular but stand in opposition to the status quo, it\u2019s vital that we work for causes and candidates who are untethered to that establishment. There are progressive candidates at every level of government\u2014from school board to president. We haven\u2019t been invested in finding and electing them, but have found ourselves working for the established interests of corporations and the party.\nFor decades now, Democrats have been apologizing for our beliefs. We\u2019ve bent over backward to and accommodate a Republican Party that has no interest in compromise, and we have settled for incremental gains instead of real victories. It\u2019s time for progressives to be smarter, fight harder, and win on our own terms.\nAfter all, if we want Democratic candidates to answer directly to the people they serve, we need to make sure that those advising them do the same. Let\u2019s all get on the same program, and fight to reclaim the promise of this country for those who need it most.\nThe stakes have never been higher.",

(Reuters / Shannon Stapleton)</figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>By the time Leah Turner sued her employer, <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2016/09/01/news/economy/chipotle-lawsuit-wage-theft/index.html\">she had worked hundreds</a>, possibly even thousands, of hours at Chipotle without getting paid. Turner&rsquo;s manager would regularly tell her to &ldquo;clock out&rdquo; from work, but still require her to work extra hours unpaid. Turner&rsquo;s boss would even sometimes retroactively go back into the system and delete hours that people had already worked. Eventually, Turner moved to a different store, only to find that wage theft was rampant there too. In 2013, Turner decided to fight back. Along with thousands of Chipotle workers, Turner filed a class-action wage-theft lawsuit against Chipotle, demanding back pay that the chain had stolen from its own workers. Individually, low-wage workers&rsquo; claims were too small to cover legal fees&mdash;but together, they could hold the company accountable.</p>\n<p>The Chipotle workers had evidence on their side. But last year, <a href=\"https://www.law360.com/articles/1070527\">thousands of the workers</a> in <i>Turner v. Chipotle</i> were tossed out of court because of a little-known legal loophole written into the fine print of their employment contracts: a forced-arbitration clause.</p>\n<p>Thousands of Chipotle workers had unknowingly signed &ldquo;mandatory arbitration agreements,&rdquo; buried deep in the fine print of their HR paperwork, waiving their right to sue over illegal treatment at work, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/08/forced-arbitration-sexual-harassment-metoo\">sexual harassment</a>, race discrimination, and wage theft. Instead of going to court, people who have signed forced-arbitration agreements are legally required to settle their claims with a private third-party arbitrator. These arbitrators are often handpicked by the defending company and paid by that same company to the tune of <a href=\"http://law.missouri.edu/arbitrationinfo/2015/10/11/how-much-does-arbitration-cost/\">$1,000 to $2,000 a day</a>. Arbitrators&rsquo; determination is final, binding on both parties, and <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/state-and-local-updates/pages/ca-court-report-arbitration-unreviewable.aspx\">virtually unreviewable</a> by courts.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/bbad3f17-7bc8-4cd2-95de-b353cb660b4b/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=770&height=433\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/4123dc24-a980-4322-a741-1017640965e1/759.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=361&width=642\"></img></figure>\n<p>Forced arbitration effectively operates as a secretive, privatized justice system that is stacked in favor of big corporations. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that workers subject to mandatory arbitration win just <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/human-rights-campaign-corporate-equality-index-arbitration-lgbtq.html\">38 percent as often</a> as they would in state court and 59 percent as often as they would in federal court. Even when workers do win, they only get a fraction of the damages. Consumers subject to forced arbitration fare just as poorly. Public Citizen found that consumers only won in <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/sites/default/files/unfairandeverywhere.pdf\"><i>6 percent</i></a> of arbitrations against financial institutions in California. Arbitration&rsquo;s opacity and <a href=\"https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2660&context=articles\">lack of procedural safeguards</a> undoubtedly benefit companies who are repeat players in the arbitration world. The threat is growing: As of 2017, more than <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/the-growing-use-of-mandatory-arbitration/\">60 million American workers</a> have signed forced-arbitration agreements in their employment contracts, and <a href=\"http://time.com/5538028/consumer-arbitration-agreements/\">81 of the largest 100 US companies</a> have forced-arbitration clauses in contracts with their customers for financial products, cell phones, and more. The game was always rigged against working people&mdash;now, they might not get to play at all.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why we launched the <a href=\"http://www.pipelineparityproject.org/\">Pipeline Parity Project</a>, a grassroots campaign of law students fighting to end forced arbitration, stop workplace discrimination, and unrig the legal system. We came to law school to hold powerful corporate actors accountable for ripping off consumers, violating their workers&rsquo; rights, or discriminating on the basis of race, gender, or disability. But our future clients may never get their day in court in the first place because of forced arbitration and corporate lawyers who use legal jargon to cover up the ways that they&rsquo;ve stacked the rules to favor big corporations. As future lawyers, we think it&rsquo;s our responsibility to take them on.</p>\n<p>When we started Pipeline Parity Project <a href=\"http://www.pipelineparityproject.org/firstyearinreview/\">last spring</a>, we were just a small group of Harvard Law School students furious about a rigged justice system. Just one year later, organized students have secured unprecedented disclosure of forced arbitration in the legal profession and forced some of the country&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.pipelineparityproject.org/kirkland-ellis-drops-forced-arbitration-after-dumpkirkland-campaign/\">largest firms</a> to <a href=\"https://www.pipelineparityproject.org/sidley-austin-drops-forced-arbitration/\">drop arbitration</a> agreements. Now, we&rsquo;re building a national network of law students who are trying to rewrite the rules that protect the powerful at the expense of the little guy.</p>\n<p>Last year, at the height of the #MeToo movement, many law firms began writing forced-arbitration clauses into their contracts with their employees, including summer interns. Some forced-arbitration clauses explicitly required firm employees&mdash;not just attorneys, but also summer interns, legal secretaries, and custodial staff&mdash;to sign away their right to sue under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits sex discrimination (including sexual harassment) at work. As #MeToo reminds us, survivors are still rarely believed unless they <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/04/opinion/metoo-law-legal-system.html\">come forward together</a>. If companies require survivors of sexual harassment to arbitrate grievances individually, they can more easily sweep sexual harassment under the rug.</p>\n<aside><figure><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cover0217.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\">View our current issue</a></figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>The problem is that many arbitration clauses include &ldquo;class action waivers,&rdquo; which require people to give up their right to participate in a class-action lawsuit. Class-action lawsuits allow workers and consumers who&rsquo;ve been ripped off in the same way to put their limited resources together to sue a larger entity. Take the Chipotle workers. The typical Chipotle crew member makes <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Chipotle-Crew-Member-Hourly-Pay-E15228_D_KO9,20.htm\">just $9 an hour</a> and probably can&rsquo;t afford to hire an attorney. Besides, most workers&rsquo; claims ranged from <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thousands-of-chipotle-workers-just-got-booted-from-a-wage-theft-lawsuit-thank-to-the-supreme-court_us_5b6d96cce4b0bdd06208b2b2\">$50 to a couple thousand</a> each. If you&rsquo;re one of the <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/12/pf/americans-lack-of-savings/index.html\">six in 10 Americans who couldn&rsquo;t cover an unexpected $500</a> bill, that&rsquo;s a lot of money&mdash;but hiring a lawyer almost certainly costs much more. With a class action, regular people can level the playing field and deter companies that would rather hide illegal conduct under the rug by distributing its effects among many people. But forced to arbitrate cases on their own, regular people may not be able to access the justice system at all. Most workers, knowing they are unlikely to succeed individual arbitration, <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3111826\">choose never to bring claims at all</a>.</p>\n<p>Wells Fargo made headlines in 2016 when it became known that the company had fraudulently set up millions of fake accounts for real consumers. Regulators eventually caught on and <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-fines-wells-fargo-100-million-widespread-illegal-practice-secretly-opening-unauthorized-accounts/\">fined</a> the company $185 million. But absent government action, consumers would have been left in the dust; Wells Fargo&rsquo;s contracts contained forced-arbitration clauses. In fact, consumers who attempted to sue over the fake accounts years earlier had been <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-wells-arbitration-20160926-snap-story.html\">thrown out of court</a>.</p>\n<p>Courts often refer to forced-arbitration clauses as &ldquo;agreements.&rdquo; In reality, they&rsquo;re anything but. Many arbitration clauses are part of &ldquo;clickwrap&rdquo; contracts: Those online forms where you &ldquo;click to agree to the terms and conditions.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201503_cfpb_arbitration-study-report-to-congress-2015.pdf\">In a 2015 study</a>, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that consumers are rarely aware that their contracts contain dispute-resolution clauses. Even when people spot an arbitration clause lurking in a contract, they may have no choice but to accept it. If you won&rsquo;t sign a forced-arbitration clause with your bank, phone company, cable provider, then you can&rsquo;t get the service. A restaurant worker or nurse who refuses to accept a forced-arbitration agreement might lose their job. In other words, regular people <i>literally</i> have no choice but to accept the terms if they want to have access to goods or even to their jobs. Companies know that consumers and workers can&rsquo;t give up important services, like having a cell phone, to argue fine-print contractual terms, so there is <a href=\"https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2660&context=articles\">no meaningful market competition</a> regulating the use of forced-arbitration agreements.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has made it <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/the-supreme-court-is-poised-to-make-forced-arbitration-nearly-inescapable/\">virtually impossible</a> for workers and consumers to fight arbitration clauses in court&mdash;but we can organize to make sure companies don&rsquo;t force people to sign them in the first place. We led a campaign to make the nation&rsquo;s most prominent <a href=\"http://www.pipelineparityproject.org/coercivecontracts/\">law firms disclose</a> whether they force employees to sign arbitration clauses, then successfully pushed several major <a href=\"https://www.law.com/2018/11/21/kirkland-ellis-drops-mandatory-arbitration-for-associates-amid-law-student-boycott/?slreturn=20190210130216\">firms</a> to <a href=\"https://www.pipelineparityproject.org/kirkland-ellis-drops-forced-arbitration-after-dumpkirkland-campaign/\">stop using</a> <a href=\"https://www.pipelineparityproject.org/sidley-austin-drops-forced-arbitration/\">forced-arbitration</a> clauses in their employees&rsquo; contracts. We&rsquo;re not the only people fighting forced arbitration in our workplaces: We work alongside <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-ends-forced-arbitration-after-employee-protest/\">Google employees</a> who led a campaign that recently forced Google to get rid of the clauses in their employment contracts. Companies rely on the people who work for them, and that gives us the power to demand equitable, decent working conditions.</p>\n<p>But as future lawyers, we know that going workplace by workplace to end forced arbitration isn&rsquo;t enough. We want to make sure our future clients aren&rsquo;t locked out of the legal system because of contractual fine print. And we want our future colleagues to realize that forced arbitration unethically prevents the disempowered from accessing justice. We need legislation to end forced arbitration altogether, for everyone.</p>\n<p>In the 1920s, Congress passed the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Legislative history shows that the FAA was meant to apply to big companies arbitrating disputes with other big companies on an equal playing field. It even had an explicit exception for employment contracts. The FAA was primarily addressed at making sure federal judges enforce arbitral awards; its authors never fathomed it would be used to uphold unconscionable forced-arbitration clauses.</p>\n<p>But the <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/att-mobility-v-concepcion/\">Supreme Court</a> has vastly extended the reach of the FAA, finding that it protects not only the outcomes of arbitrated disputes but forced-arbitration clauses themselves. Because the Supreme Court, especially Trump appointee Justice Gorsuch, is so arbitration-friendly, states are effectively barred from limiting forced arbitration. That means we need federal legislation. Federal agencies have tried: In 2017, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress <a href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/senate-repeals-cfpb-arbitration-rule-in-win-for-financial-institutions\">blocked</a> a rule from the CFPB that would have limited the use of forced-arbitration agreements in consumer finance contracts.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why we support the recently reintroduced <a href=\"https://www.lieffcabraser.com/2019/02/lawmakers-announce-new-fair-act-bill-to-end-forced-arbitration/\">FAIR Act</a>, which would amend the FAA to ban the use of forced arbitration in employment, consumer, and health-care contracts&mdash;in other worse, it would limit forced arbitration in cases where there are severe asymmetries of power between the parties and the FAA was never supposed to apply.</p>\n<p>Forced arbitration is bad for workers, bad for consumers, and bad for the justice system. The deck is already stacked in favor of large corporations. We&rsquo;ll pursue legislative, advocacy, and legal means to level the playing field so our future clients can have their day in court.</p>",

Turner\u2019s manager would regularly tell her to \u201cclock out\u201d from work, but still require her to work extra hours unpaid. Turner\u2019s boss would even sometimes retroactively go back into the system and delete hours that people had already worked. Eventually, Turner moved to a different store, only to find that wage theft was rampant there too. In 2013, Turner decided to fight back. Along with thousands of Chipotle workers, Turner filed a class-action wage-theft lawsuit against Chipotle, demanding back pay that the chain had stolen from its own workers. Individually, low-wage workers\u2019 claims were too small to cover legal fees\u2014but together, they could hold the company accountable.\nThe Chipotle workers had evidence on their side. But last year, thousands of the workers in Turner v. Chipotle were tossed out of court because of a little-known legal loophole written into the fine print of their employment contracts: a forced-arbitration clause.\nThousands of Chipotle workers had unknowingly signed \u201cmandatory arbitration agreements,\u201d buried deep in the fine print of their HR paperwork, waiving their right to sue over illegal treatment at work, like sexual harassment, race discrimination, and wage theft. Instead of going to court, people who have signed forced-arbitration agreements are legally required to settle their claims with a private third-party arbitrator. These arbitrators are often handpicked by the defending company and paid by that same company to the tune of $1,000 to $2,000 a day. Arbitrators\u2019 determination is final, binding on both parties, and virtually unreviewable by courts.\nForced arbitration effectively operates as a secretive, privatized justice system that is stacked in favor of big corporations. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that workers subject to mandatory arbitration win just 38 percent as often as they would in state court and 59 percent as often as they would in federal court. Even when workers do win, they only get a fraction of the damages. Consumers subject to forced arbitration fare just as poorly. Public Citizen found that consumers only won in 6 percent of arbitrations against financial institutions in California. Arbitration\u2019s opacity and lack of procedural safeguards undoubtedly benefit companies who are repeat players in the arbitration world. The threat is growing: As of 2017, more than 60 million American workers have signed forced-arbitration agreements in their employment contracts, and 81 of the largest 100 US companies have forced-arbitration clauses in contracts with their customers for financial products, cell phones, and more. The game was always rigged against working people\u2014now, they might not get to play at all.\nThat\u2019s why we launched the Pipeline Parity Project, a grassroots campaign of law students fighting to end forced arbitration, stop workplace discrimination, and unrig the legal system. We came to law school to hold powerful corporate actors accountable for ripping off consumers, violating their workers\u2019 rights, or discriminating on the basis of race, gender, or disability. But our future clients may never get their day in court in the first place because of forced arbitration and corporate lawyers who use legal jargon to cover up the ways that they\u2019ve stacked the rules to favor big corporations. As future lawyers, we think it\u2019s our responsibility to take them on.\nWhen we started Pipeline Parity Project last spring, we were just a small group of Harvard Law School students furious about a rigged justice system. Just one year later, organized students have secured unprecedented disclosure of forced arbitration in the legal profession and forced some of the country\u2019s largest firms to drop arbitration agreements. Now, we\u2019re building a national network of law students who are trying to rewrite the rules that protect the powerful at the expense of the little guy.\nLast year, at the height of the #MeToo movement, many law firms began writing forced-arbitration clauses into their contracts with their employees, including summer interns. Some forced-arbitration clauses explicitly required firm employees\u2014not just attorneys, but also summer interns, legal secretaries, and custodial staff\u2014to sign away their right to sue under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits sex discrimination (including sexual harassment) at work. As #MeToo reminds us, survivors are still rarely believed unless they come forward together. If companies require survivors of sexual harassment to arbitrate grievances individually, they can more easily sweep sexual harassment under the rug.\nThe problem is that many arbitration clauses include \u201cclass action waivers,\u201d which require people to give up their right to participate in a class-action lawsuit. Class-action lawsuits allow workers and consumers who\u2019ve been ripped off in the same way to put their limited resources together to sue a larger entity. Take the Chipotle workers. The typical Chipotle crew member makes just $9 an hour and probably can\u2019t afford to hire an attorney. Besides, most workers\u2019 claims ranged from $50 to a couple thousand each. If you\u2019re one of the six in 10 Americans who couldn\u2019t cover an unexpected $500 bill, that\u2019s a lot of money\u2014but hiring a lawyer almost certainly costs much more. With a class action, regular people can level the playing field and deter companies that would rather hide illegal conduct under the rug by distributing its effects among many people. But forced to arbitrate cases on their own, regular people may not be able to access the justice system at all. Most workers, knowing they are unlikely to succeed individual arbitration, choose never to bring claims at all.\nWells Fargo made headlines in 2016 when it became known that the company had fraudulently set up millions of fake accounts for real consumers. Regulators eventually caught on and fined the company $185 million. But absent government action, consumers would have been left in the dust; Wells Fargo\u2019s contracts contained forced-arbitration clauses. In fact, consumers who attempted to sue over the fake accounts years earlier had been thrown out of court.\nCourts often refer to forced-arbitration clauses as \u201cagreements.\u201d In reality, they\u2019re anything but. Many arbitration clauses are part of \u201cclickwrap\u201d contracts: Those online forms where you \u201cclick to agree to the terms and conditions.\u201d In a 2015 study, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that consumers are rarely aware that their contracts contain dispute-resolution clauses. Even when people spot an arbitration clause lurking in a contract, they may have no choice but to accept it. If you won\u2019t sign a forced-arbitration clause with your bank, phone company, cable provider, then you can\u2019t get the service. A restaurant worker or nurse who refuses to accept a forced-arbitration agreement might lose their job. In other words, regular people literally have no choice but to accept the terms if they want to have access to goods or even to their jobs. Companies know that consumers and workers can\u2019t give up important services, like having a cell phone, to argue fine-print contractual terms, so there is no meaningful market competition regulating the use of forced-arbitration agreements.\nThe Supreme Court has made it virtually impossible for workers and consumers to fight arbitration clauses in court\u2014but we can organize to make sure companies don\u2019t force people to sign them in the first place. We led a campaign to make the nation\u2019s most prominent law firms disclose whether they force employees to sign arbitration clauses, then successfully pushed several major firms to stop using forced-arbitration clauses in their employees\u2019 contracts. We\u2019re not the only people fighting forced arbitration in our workplaces: We work alongside Google employees who led a campaign that recently forced Google to get rid of the clauses in their employment contracts. Companies rely on the people who work for them, and that gives us the power to demand equitable, decent working conditions.\nBut as future lawyers, we know that going workplace by workplace to end forced arbitration isn\u2019t enough. We want to make sure our future clients aren\u2019t locked out of the legal system because of contractual fine print. And we want our future colleagues to realize that forced arbitration unethically prevents the disempowered from accessing justice. We need legislation to end forced arbitration altogether, for everyone.\nIn the 1920s, Congress passed the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Legislative history shows that the FAA was meant to apply to big companies arbitrating disputes with other big companies on an equal playing field. It even had an explicit exception for employment contracts. The FAA was primarily addressed at making sure federal judges enforce arbitral awards; its authors never fathomed it would be used to uphold unconscionable forced-arbitration clauses.\nBut the Supreme Court has vastly extended the reach of the FAA, finding that it protects not only the outcomes of arbitrated disputes but forced-arbitration clauses themselves. Because the Supreme Court, especially Trump appointee Justice Gorsuch, is so arbitration-friendly, states are effectively barred from limiting forced arbitration. That means we need federal legislation. Federal agencies have tried: In 2017, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress blocked a rule from the CFPB that would have limited the use of forced-arbitration agreements in consumer finance contracts.\nThat\u2019s why we support the recently reintroduced FAIR Act, which would amend the FAA to ban the use of forced arbitration in employment, consumer, and health-care contracts\u2014in other worse, it would limit forced arbitration in cases where there are severe asymmetries of power between the parties and the FAA was never supposed to apply.\nForced arbitration is bad for workers, bad for consumers, and bad for the justice system. The deck is already stacked in favor of large corporations. We\u2019ll pursue legislative, advocacy, and legal means to level the playing field so our future clients can have their day in court.",

And this phenomenon of ever more concentrated wealth and power has both Newtonian and Darwinian components to it.</p>\n<p>In terms of Newton&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/newton1g.html\">first law</a> of motion: Those in power will remain in power unless acted upon by an external force. Those who are wealthy will only gain in wealth as long as nothing deflects them from their present course. As for Darwin, in the world of financial evolution, those with wealth or power will do what&rsquo;s in their best interest to protect that wealth, even if it&rsquo;s in no one else&rsquo;s interest at all.</p>\n<p>In George Orwell&rsquo;s iconic 1945 novel, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/8193387643/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20\"><em>Animal Farm</em></a>, the pigs who gain control in a rebellion against a human farmer eventually impose a dictatorship on the other animals on the basis of a single <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6466-all-animals-are-equal-but-some-animals-are-more-equal\">commandment</a>: &ldquo;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&rdquo; In terms of the American republic, the modern equivalent would be: &ldquo;All citizens are equal, but the wealthy are so much more equal than anyone else (and plan to remain that way).&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/bbad3f17-7bc8-4cd2-95de-b353cb660b4b/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=770&height=433\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/4123dc24-a980-4322-a741-1017640965e1/759.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=361&width=642\"></img></figure>\n<p>Certainly, inequality is the economic great wall between those with power and those without it.</p>\n<p>As the animals of Orwell&rsquo;s farm grew ever less equal, so in the present moment in a country that still claims equal opportunity for its citizens, one in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/08/bill-gates-jeff-bezos-warren-buffett-wealthier-than-poorest-half-of-us\">three Americans</a> now have as much wealth as the bottom half of society (160 million people), you could certainly say that we live in an increasingly Orwellian society. Or perhaps an increasingly Twainian one.</p>\n<p>After all, Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner wrote a classic 1873 novel that put an unforgettable label on their moment and could do the same for ours. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1521150516/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20\"><em>The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today</em></a> depicted the greed and political corruption of post&ndash;Civil War America. Its title caught the spirit of what proved to be a long moment when the &uuml;ber-rich came to dominate Washington and the rest of America. It was a period saturated with robber barons, professional grifters, and incomprehensibly wealthy banking magnates. (Anything sound familiar?) The main difference between that last century&rsquo;s gilded moment and this one was that those robber barons built tangible things like railroads. Today&rsquo;s equivalent crew of the mega-wealthy build remarkably intangible things like tech and electronic platforms, while a grifter of a president opts for the only new infrastructure in sight, a great wall to nowhere.</p>\n<p>In Twain&rsquo;s epoch, the United States was emerging from the Civil War. Opportunists were rising from the ashes of the nation&rsquo;s battered soul. Land speculation, government lobbying, and shady deals soon converged to create an unequal society of the first order (at least until now). Soon after their novel came out, a series of recessions ravaged the country, followed by a 1907 financial panic in <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/panic_of_1907\">New York City</a> caused by a speculator-led copper-market scam.</p>\n<aside><figure><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cover0217.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\">View our current issue</a></figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>From the late 1890s on, the most powerful banker on the planet, J.P. Morgan, was called upon multiple times to bail out a country on the economic edge. In 1907, Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou provided him with <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=klEeBQAAQBAJ&q=%2425+million#v=snippet&q=%2425%20million&f=false\">$25 million</a> in bailout money at the request of President Theodore Roosevelt to stabilize Wall Street and calm frantic citizens trying to withdraw their deposits from banks around the country. And this Morgan did&mdash;by helping his friends and their companies, while skimming money off the top himself. As for the most troubled banks holding the savings of ordinary people? Well, they folded. (Shades of the 2007&ndash;08 meltdown and bailout anyone?)</p>\n<p>The leading bankers who had received that bounty from the government went on to cause the <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/stock_market_crash_of_1929\">Crash of 1929</a>. Not surprisingly, much speculation and fraud preceded it. In those years, the novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10367-let-me-tell-you-about-the-very-rich-they-are\">caught</a> the era&rsquo;s spirit of grotesque inequality in <em>The Great Gatsby</em> when one of his characters comments: &ldquo;Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me.&rdquo; The same could certainly be said of today when it comes to the gaping maw between the have-nots and have-a-lots.</p>\n<p>Income vs. Wealth</p>\n<p>To fully grasp the nature of inequality in our 21st-century gilded age, it&rsquo;s important to understand the difference between wealth and income and what kinds of inequality stem from each. Simply put, income is how much money you make in terms of paid work or any return on investments or assets (or other things you own that have the potential to change in value). Wealth is simply the gross accumulation of those very assets <em>and</em> any return or appreciation on them. The more wealth you have, the easier it is to have a higher annual income.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s break that down. If you earn <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEPAINUSA672N\">$31,000</a> a year, the median salary for an individual in the United States today, your income would be that amount minus associated taxes (including federal, state, Social Security, and Medicare ones). On average, that means you would be left with about <a href=\"https://neuvoo.com/tax-calculator/California-31000\">$26,000</a> before other expenses kicked in.</p>\n<p>If your wealth is $1,000,000, however, and you put that into a savings account paying <a href=\"https://www.synchronybank.com/banking/high-yield-savings/\">2.25 percent interest</a>, you could receive about $22,500 and, after taxes, be left with about $19,000, for doing nothing whatsoever.</p>\n<p>To put all this in perspective, the top 1 percent of Americans now take home, on average, more than 40 times the incomes of the bottom 90 percent. And if you head for the top 0.1 percent, those figures only radically worsen. That tiny crew takes home <a href=\"https://inequality.org/facts/income-inequality/\">more than 198 times</a> the income of the bottom 90 percent. They also possess <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/americas-top-01-households-hold-same-amount-of-wealth-as-bottom-90-2017-10\">as much wealth</a> as the nation&rsquo;s bottom 90 percent. &ldquo;Wealth,&rdquo; as Adam Smith so classically noted almost two-and-a-half-centuries ago in <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1373762-an-inquiry-into-the-nature-and-causes-of-the-wealth-of-nations?page=4\"><em>The Wealth of Nations</em></a>, &ldquo;is power,&rdquo; an adage that seldom, sadly, seems outdated.</p>\n<p>A Case Study: Wealth, Inequality, and the Federal Reserve</p>\n<p>Obviously, if you inherit wealth in this country, you&rsquo;re instantly ahead of the game. In America, a third to nearly a half of all wealth is <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2015/01/30/wealth-inheritance-and-social-mobility/\">inherited</a> rather than self-made. According to a <em>New York Times</em> investigation, for instance, President Donald Trump, from birth, received an estimated <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html\">$413 million</a> (in today&rsquo;s dollars, that is) from his dear old dad and another <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/trumps-small-loan-from-his-father-was-more-like-60point7-million-nyt.html\">$140 million</a> (in today&rsquo;s dollars) in loans. Not a bad way for a &ldquo;businessman&rdquo; to begin building the empire (of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/nyregion/donald-trump-atlantic-city.html\">bankruptcies</a>) that became the platform for a presidential campaign that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/28/trump-collects-on-business-and-presidency-is-boosting-brand.html\">oozed</a> into actually running the country. Trump did it, in other words, the old-fashioned way&mdash;through inheritance.</p>\n<p>In his megalomaniacal zeal to declare a national emergency at the southern border, that gilded millionaire-turned-billionaire-turned-president provides but one of many examples of a long record of abusing power. Unfortunately, in this country, few people consider record inequality (which is still growing) as another kind of abuse of power, another kind of great wall, in this case keeping not Central Americans but most US citizens out.</p>\n<p>The Federal Reserve, the country&rsquo;s central bank that dictates the cost of money and that sustained Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007&ndash;08 (and since), has finally pointed out that such extreme levels of inequality are bad news for the rest of the country. As Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/07/feds-powell-reveals-biggest-economic-challenge-over-the-next-decade.html\">town hall</a> in Washington in early February, &ldquo;We want prosperity to be widely shared. We need policies to make that happen.&rdquo; Sadly, the Fed has largely contributed to <a href=\"https://mises.org/wire/feds-easy-money-policies-arent-helping-income-growth\">increasing</a> the systemic inequality now ingrained in the financial and, by extension, political system. In a recent <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018048pap.pdf\">research paper</a>, the Fed did, at least, underscore the consequences of inequality to the economy, showing that &ldquo;income inequality can generate low aggregate demand, deflation pressure, excessive credit growth, and financial instability.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the wake of the global economic meltdown, however, the Fed took it upon itself to reduce the cost of money for big banks by chopping interest rates to zero (before eventually raising them to 2.5 percent) and buying $4.5 trillion in Treasury and mortgage bonds to lower it further. All this so that banks could ostensibly lend money more easily to Main Street and stimulate the economy. As Senator Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/the-fed-audit\">noted</a>, though, &ldquo;The Federal Reserve provided more than $16 trillion in total financial assistance to some of the largest financial institutions and corporations in the United States and throughout the world.&hellip; a clear case of socialism for the rich and rugged, you&rsquo;re-on-your-own individualism for everyone else.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The economy has been treading water ever since (especially compared to the stock market). Annual gross domestic-product growth has not surpassed <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/188165/annual-gdp-growth-of-the-united-states-since-1990/\">3 percent</a> in any year since the financial crisis, even as the level of the stock market <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI/chart?p=%5EDJI#eyJpbnRlcnZhbCI6IndlZWsiLCJwZXJpb2RpY2l0eSI6MSwiY2FuZGxlV2lkdGgiOjEuOTMxMDM0NDgyNzU4NjIwOCwidm9sdW1lVW5kZXJsYXkiOnRydWUsImFkaiI6dHJ1ZSwiY3Jvc3NoYWlyIjp0cnVlLCJjaGFydFR5cGUiOiJsaW5lIiwiZXh0ZW5kZ\">tripled</a>, grotesquely increasing the country&rsquo;s inequality gap. None of this should have been surprising, since much of the excess money went straight to big banks, rich investors, and speculators. They then used it to invest in the stock and bond markets, but not in things that would matter to all the Americans outside that great wall of wealth.</p>\n<p>The question is: Why are inequality and a flawed economic system mutually reinforcing? As a starting point, those able to invest in a stock market buoyed by the Fed&rsquo;s policies only increased their wealth exponentially. In contrast, those relying on the economy to sustain them via wages and other income got shafted. Most people aren&rsquo;t, of course, invested in the stock market, or really in anything. They can&rsquo;t afford to be. It&rsquo;s important to remember that nearly <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/shutdown-highlights-that-4-in-5-us-workers-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html\">80 percent</a> of the population lives paycheck to paycheck.</p>\n<p>The net result: an <a href=\"https://inequality.org/facts/wealth-inequality/\">acute</a> post-financial-crisis increase in wealth inequality&mdash;on top of the income inequality that was global but especially true in the United States. The crew in the top 1 percent that doesn&rsquo;t rely on salaries to increase their wealth prospered fabulously. They, after all, now own <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-richest-1-own-50-of-stocks-held-by-american-households-15075\">more than half</a> of all national wealth invested in stocks and mutual funds, so a soaring stock market disproportionately helps them. It&rsquo;s also why the Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2017/08/18/the-hutchins-center-explains-the-feds-balance-sheet/\">subsidy</a> policies to Wall Street banks have only added to the extreme wealth of those extreme few.</p>\n<p>The Ramifications of Inequality</p>\n<p>The list of negatives resulting from such inequality is long indeed. As a start, the only thing the majority of Americans possess a greater proportion of than that top 1 percent is a mountain of debt.</p>\n<p>The bottom 90 percent are the lucky owners of about three-quarters of the country&rsquo;s household debt. Mortgages, auto loans, student loans, and credit-card debt are cumulatively at a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-debt/red-flags-emerge-as-americans-debt-load-hits-another-record-idUSKCN1Q11YV\">record-high $13.5 trillion</a>.</p>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s just to start down a slippery slope. As <a href=\"https://inequality.org/facts/inequality-and-health/\">Inequality.org</a> reports, wealth and income inequality impact &ldquo;everything from life expectancy to infant mortality and obesity.&rdquo; High economic inequality and poor health, for instance, go hand and hand, or put another way, inequality compromises the overall health of the country. According to academic findings, income inequality is, in the most literal sense, making Americans sick. As one study <a href=\"https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2014/02/10/income-inequality/\">put it</a>, &ldquo;diseased and impoverished economic infrastructures [help] lead to diseased or impoverished or unbalanced bodies or minds.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s Social Security, <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/history/35act.html\">established in 1935</a> as a federal supplement for those in need who have also paid into the system through a tax on their wages. Today, all workers contribute 6.2 percent of their annual earnings and employers pay the other 6.2 percent (up to a cap of <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/colafacts2019.pdf\">$132,900</a>) into the Social Security system. Those making far more than that, specifically millionaires and billionaires, don&rsquo;t have to pay a dime more on a proportional basis. In practice, that means about <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Social%20Security%20Statment%20-%208-24-11.pdf\">94 percent</a> of American workers and their employers paid the full 12.4 percent of their annual earnings toward Social Security, while the other 6 percent paid an often significantly smaller fraction of their earnings.</p>\n<p>According to his <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/poverty/news/2019/02/13/466134/heres-much-americas-rising-income-inequality-costing-social-security/\">own claims</a> about his 2016 income, for instance, President Trump &ldquo;contributed a mere 0.002 percent of his income to Social Security in 2016.&rdquo; That means it would take nearly <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/poverty/news/2019/02/13/466134/heres-much-americas-rising-income-inequality-costing-social-security/\">22,000</a> additional workers earning the median US salary to make up for what he doesn&rsquo;t have to pay. And the greater the income inequality in this country, the more money those who make less have to put into the Social Security system on a proportional basis. In recent years, a staggering <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2017/4b.html#table4.b1\">$1.4 trillion</a> could have gone into that system, if there were no arbitrary payroll cap favoring the wealthy.</p>\n<p>Inequality: A Dilemma With Global Implications</p>\n<p>America is great at minting millionaires. It has the highest concentration of them, globally speaking, at 41 percent. (Another 24 percent of that millionaires&rsquo; club can be found in Europe.) And the top 1 percent of US citizens earn 40 times the national average and <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/27/news/economy/inequality-record-top-1-percent-wealth/index.html\">own about 38.6 percent</a> of the country&rsquo;s total wealth. The highest figure in any other developed country is &ldquo;only&rdquo; 28 percent.</p>\n<p>However, while the United States boasts of epic levels of inequality, it&rsquo;s also a global trend. Consider this: the world&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://inequality.org/facts/global-inequality/\">richest 1 percent</a> own 45 percent of total wealth on this planet. In contrast, <a href=\"https://inequality.org/facts/global-inequality/\">64 percent</a> of the population (with an average of $10,000 in wealth to their name) holds less than 2 percent. And to widen the inequality picture a bit more, the world&rsquo;s richest 10 percent, those having at least $100,000 in assets, own 84 percent of total global wealth.</p>\n<p>The billionaires&rsquo; club is where it&rsquo;s really at, though. According to Oxfam, the richest <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2018-01-22/richest-1-percent-bagged-82-percent-wealth-created-last-year\">42 billionaires</a> have a combined wealth equal to that of the poorest 50 percent of humanity. Rest assured, however, that in this gilded century there&rsquo;s inequality even among billionaires. After all, the 10 richest among them possess <a href=\"https://www.theweek.co.uk/people/57553/top-billionaires-who-richest-person-world\">$745 billion</a> in total global wealth. The next 10 down the list possess a mere <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#2a490e60251c\">$451.5 billion</a>, and why even bother tallying the next 10 when you get the picture?</p>\n<p>Oxfam also recently <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/even-it/5-shocking-facts-about-extreme-global-inequality-and-how-even-it-davos\">reported</a> that &ldquo;the number of billionaires has almost doubled, with a new billionaire created every two days between 2017 and 2018. They have now more wealth than ever before while almost half of humanity have barely escaped extreme poverty, living on less than $5.50 a day.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>How Does It End?</p>\n<p>In sum, the rich are only getting richer and it&rsquo;s happening at a historic rate. Worse yet, over the past decade, there was an extra perk for the truly wealthy. They could bulk up on assets that had been devalued due to the financial crisis, while so many of their peers on the other side of that great wall of wealth were economically decimated by the 2007&ndash;08 meltdown and have yet to <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/12/01/news/economy/recession-anniversary/index.html\">fully recover</a>.</p>\n<p>What we&rsquo;ve seen ever since is how money just keeps flowing upward through banks and massive speculation, while the economic lives of those not at the top of the financial food chain have largely remained stagnant or worse. The result is, of course, sweeping inequality of a kind that, in much of the last century, might have seemed inconceivable.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we will all have to face the black cloud this throws over the entire economy. Real people in the real world, those not at the top, have experienced a decade of ever-greater instability, while the inequality gap of this beyond-gilded age is sure to shape a truly messy world ahead. In other words, this can&rsquo;t end well.</p>",

                "text": "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.\nLike a gilded coating that makes the dullest things glitter, today\u2019s thin veneer of political populism covers a grotesque underbelly of growing inequality that\u2019s hiding in plain sight. And this phenomenon of ever more concentrated wealth and power has both Newtonian and Darwinian components to it.\nIn terms of Newton\u2019s first law of motion: Those in power will remain in power unless acted upon by an external force. Those who are wealthy will only gain in wealth as long as nothing deflects them from their present course. As for Darwin, in the world of financial evolution, those with wealth or power will do what\u2019s in their best interest to protect that wealth, even if it\u2019s in no one else\u2019s interest at all.\nIn George Orwell\u2019s iconic 1945 novel, Animal Farm, the pigs who gain control in a rebellion against a human farmer eventually impose a dictatorship on the other animals on the basis of a single commandment: \u201cAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\u201d In terms of the American republic, the modern equivalent would be: \u201cAll citizens are equal, but the wealthy are so much more equal than anyone else (and plan to remain that way).\u201d\nCertainly, inequality is the economic great wall between those with power and those without it.\nAs the animals of Orwell\u2019s farm grew ever less equal, so in the present moment in a country that still claims equal opportunity for its citizens, one in which three Americans now have as much wealth as the bottom half of society (160 million people), you could certainly say that we live in an increasingly Orwellian society. Or perhaps an increasingly Twainian one.\nAfter all, Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner wrote a classic 1873 novel that put an unforgettable label on their moment and could do the same for ours. The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today depicted the greed and political corruption of post\u2013Civil War America. Its title caught the spirit of what proved to be a long moment when the \u00fcber-rich came to dominate Washington and the rest of America. It was a period saturated with robber barons, professional grifters, and incomprehensibly wealthy banking magnates. (Anything sound familiar?) The main difference between that last century\u2019s gilded moment and this one was that those robber barons built tangible things like railroads. Today\u2019s equivalent crew of the mega-wealthy build remarkably intangible things like tech and electronic platforms, while a grifter of a president opts for the only new infrastructure in sight, a great wall to nowhere.\nIn Twain\u2019s epoch, the United States was emerging from the Civil War. Opportunists were rising from the ashes of the nation\u2019s battered soul. Land speculation, government lobbying, and shady deals soon converged to create an unequal society of the first order (at least until now). Soon after their novel came out, a series of recessions ravaged the country, followed by a 1907 financial panic in New York City caused by a speculator-led copper-market scam.\nFrom the late 1890s on, the most powerful banker on the planet, J.P. Morgan, was called upon multiple times to bail out a country on the economic edge. In 1907, Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou provided him with $25 million in bailout money at the request of President Theodore Roosevelt to stabilize Wall Street and calm frantic citizens trying to withdraw their deposits from banks around the country. And this Morgan did\u2014by helping his friends and their companies, while skimming money off the top himself. As for the most troubled banks holding the savings of ordinary people? Well, they folded. (Shades of the 2007\u201308 meltdown and bailout anyone?)\nThe leading bankers who had received that bounty from the government went on to cause the Crash of 1929. Not surprisingly, much speculation and fraud preceded it. In those years, the novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald caught the era\u2019s spirit of grotesque inequality in The Great Gatsby when one of his characters comments: \u201cLet me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me.\u201d The same could certainly be said of today when it comes to the gaping maw between the have-nots and have-a-lots.\nIncome vs. Wealth\nTo fully grasp the nature of inequality in our 21st-century gilded age, it\u2019s important to understand the difference between wealth and income and what kinds of inequality stem from each. Simply put, income is how much money you make in terms of paid work or any return on investments or assets (or other things you own that have the potential to change in value). Wealth is simply the gross accumulation of those very assets and any return or appreciation on them. The more wealth you have, the easier it is to have a higher annual income.\nLet\u2019s break that down. If you earn $31,000 a year, the median salary for an individual in the United States today, your income would be that amount minus associated taxes (including federal, state, Social Security, and Medicare ones). On average, that means you would be left with about $26,000 before other expenses kicked in.\nIf your wealth is $1,000,000, however, and you put that into a savings account paying 2.25 percent interest, you could receive about $22,500 and, after taxes, be left with about $19,000, for doing nothing whatsoever.\nTo put all this in perspective, the top 1 percent of Americans now take home, on average, more than 40 times the incomes of the bottom 90 percent. And if you head for the top 0.1 percent, those figures only radically worsen. That tiny crew takes home more than 198 times the income of the bottom 90 percent. They also possess as much wealth as the nation\u2019s bottom 90 percent. \u201cWealth,\u201d as Adam Smith so classically noted almost two-and-a-half-centuries ago in The Wealth of Nations, \u201cis power,\u201d an adage that seldom, sadly, seems outdated.\nA Case Study: Wealth, Inequality, and the Federal Reserve\nObviously, if you inherit wealth in this country, you\u2019re instantly ahead of the game. In America, a third to nearly a half of all wealth is inherited rather than self-made. According to a New York Times investigation, for instance, President Donald Trump, from birth, received an estimated $413 million (in today\u2019s dollars, that is) from his dear old dad and another $140 million (in today\u2019s dollars) in loans. Not a bad way for a \u201cbusinessman\u201d to begin building the empire (of bankruptcies) that became the platform for a presidential campaign that oozed into actually running the country. Trump did it, in other words, the old-fashioned way\u2014through inheritance.\nIn his megalomaniacal zeal to declare a national emergency at the southern border, that gilded millionaire-turned-billionaire-turned-president provides but one of many examples of a long record of abusing power. Unfortunately, in this country, few people consider record inequality (which is still growing) as another kind of abuse of power, another kind of great wall, in this case keeping not Central Americans but most US citizens out.\nThe Federal Reserve, the country\u2019s central bank that dictates the cost of money and that sustained Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007\u201308 (and since), has finally pointed out that such extreme levels of inequality are bad news for the rest of the country. As Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a town hall in Washington in early February, \u201cWe want prosperity to be widely shared. We need policies to make that happen.\u201d Sadly, the Fed has largely contributed to increasing the systemic inequality now ingrained in the financial and, by extension, political system. In a recent research paper, the Fed did, at least, underscore the consequences of inequality to the economy, showing that \u201cincome inequality can generate low aggregate demand, deflation pressure, excessive credit growth, and financial instability.\u201d\nIn the wake of the global economic meltdown, however, the Fed took it upon itself to reduce the cost of money for big banks by chopping interest rates to zero (before eventually raising them to 2.5 percent) and buying $4.5 trillion in Treasury and mortgage bonds to lower it further. All this so that banks could ostensibly lend money more easily to Main Street and stimulate the economy. As Senator Bernie Sanders noted, though, \u201cThe Federal Reserve provided more than $16 trillion in total financial assistance to some of the largest financial institutions and corporations in the United States and throughout the world.\u2026 a clear case of socialism for the rich and rugged, you\u2019re-on-your-own individualism for everyone else.\u201d\nThe economy has been treading water ever since (especially compared to the stock market). Annual gross domestic-product growth has not surpassed 3 percent in any year since the financial crisis, even as the level of the stock market tripled, grotesquely increasing the country\u2019s inequality gap. None of this should have been surprising, since much of the excess money went straight to big banks, rich investors, and speculators. They then used it to invest in the stock and bond markets, but not in things that would matter to all the Americans outside that great wall of wealth.\nThe question is: Why are inequality and a flawed economic system mutually reinforcing? As a starting point, those able to invest in a stock market buoyed by the Fed\u2019s policies only increased their wealth exponentially. In contrast, those relying on the economy to sustain them via wages and other income got shafted. Most people aren\u2019t, of course, invested in the stock market, or really in anything. They can\u2019t afford to be. It\u2019s important to remember that nearly 80 percent of the population lives paycheck to paycheck.\nThe net result: an acute post-financial-crisis increase in wealth inequality\u2014on top of the income inequality that was global but especially true in the United States. The crew in the top 1 percent that doesn\u2019t rely on salaries to increase their wealth prospered fabulously. They, after all, now own more than half of all national wealth invested in stocks and mutual funds, so a soaring stock market disproportionately helps them. It\u2019s also why the Federal Reserve subsidy policies to Wall Street banks have only added to the extreme wealth of those extreme few.\nThe Ramifications of Inequality\nThe list of negatives resulting from such inequality is long indeed. As a start, the only thing the majority of Americans possess a greater proportion of than that top 1 percent is a mountain of debt.\nThe bottom 90 percent are the lucky owners of about three-quarters of the country\u2019s household debt. Mortgages, auto loans, student loans, and credit-card debt are cumulatively at a record-high $13.5 trillion.\nAnd that\u2019s just to start down a slippery slope. As Inequality.org reports, wealth and income inequality impact \u201ceverything from life expectancy to infant mortality and obesity.\u201d High economic inequality and poor health, for instance, go hand and hand, or put another way, inequality compromises the overall health of the country. According to academic findings, income inequality is, in the most literal sense, making Americans sick. As one study put it, \u201cdiseased and impoverished economic infrastructures [help] lead to diseased or impoverished or unbalanced bodies or minds.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s Social Security, established in 1935 as a federal supplement for those in need who have also paid into the system through a tax on their wages. Today, all workers contribute 6.2 percent of their annual earnings and employers pay the other 6.2 percent (up to a cap of $132,900) into the Social Security system. Those making far more than that, specifically millionaires and billionaires, don\u2019t have to pay a dime more on a proportional basis. In practice, that means about 94 percent of American workers and their employers paid the full 12.4 percent of their annual earnings toward Social Security, while the other 6 percent paid an often significantly smaller fraction of their earnings.\nAccording to his own claims about his 2016 income, for instance, President Trump \u201ccontributed a mere 0.002 percent of his income to Social Security in 2016.\u201d That means it would take nearly 22,000 additional workers earning the median US salary to make up for what he doesn\u2019t have to pay. And the greater the income inequality in this country, the more money those who make less have to put into the Social Security system on a proportional basis. In recent years, a staggering $1.4 trillion could have gone into that system, if there were no arbitrary payroll cap favoring the wealthy.\nInequality: A Dilemma With Global Implications\nAmerica is great at minting millionaires. It has the highest concentration of them, globally speaking, at 41 percent. (Another 24 percent of that millionaires\u2019 club can be found in Europe.) And the top 1 percent of US citizens earn 40 times the national average and own about 38.6 percent of the country\u2019s total wealth. The highest figure in any other developed country is \u201conly\u201d 28 percent.\nHowever, while the United States boasts of epic levels of inequality, it\u2019s also a global trend. Consider this: the world\u2019s richest 1 percent own 45 percent of total wealth on this planet. In contrast, 64 percent of the population (with an average of $10,000 in wealth to their name) holds less than 2 percent. And to widen the inequality picture a bit more, the world\u2019s richest 10 percent, those having at least $100,000 in assets, own 84 percent of total global wealth.\nThe billionaires\u2019 club is where it\u2019s really at, though. According to Oxfam, the richest 42 billionaires have a combined wealth equal to that of the poorest 50 percent of humanity. Rest assured, however, that in this gilded century there\u2019s inequality even among billionaires. After all, the 10 richest among them possess $745 billion in total global wealth. The next 10 down the list possess a mere $451.5 billion, and why even bother tallying the next 10 when you get the picture?\nOxfam also recently reported that \u201cthe number of billionaires has almost doubled, with a new billionaire created every two days between 2017 and 2018. They have now more wealth than ever before while almost half of humanity have barely escaped extreme poverty, living on less than $5.50 a day.\u201d\nHow Does It End?\nIn sum, the rich are only getting richer and it\u2019s happening at a historic rate. Worse yet, over the past decade, there was an extra perk for the truly wealthy. They could bulk up on assets that had been devalued due to the financial crisis, while so many of their peers on the other side of that great wall of wealth were economically decimated by the 2007\u201308 meltdown and have yet to fully recover.\nWhat we\u2019ve seen ever since is how money just keeps flowing upward through banks and massive speculation, while the economic lives of those not at the top of the financial food chain have largely remained stagnant or worse. The result is, of course, sweeping inequality of a kind that, in much of the last century, might have seemed inconceivable.\nEventually, we will all have to face the black cloud this throws over the entire economy. Real people in the real world, those not at the top, have experienced a decade of ever-greater instability, while the inequality gap of this beyond-gilded age is sure to shape a truly messy world ahead. In other words, this can\u2019t end well.",

Last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) <a href=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-plan-for-universal-child-care-762535e6c20a\">unveiled her proposal</a> for universal childcare in the United States. While other candidates have discussed the need for affordable childcare&mdash;and it was one of Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s priorities in 2016&mdash;Warren&rsquo;s plan is clearly the most ambitious proposal to date. It would establish a network of federally funded, locally run childcare centers across the nation. Enrollment would be completely free for millions of children and affordable for all, with the total cost per family capped at 7 percent of a family&rsquo;s income, no matter the number of kids. The centers would be staffed by qualified care providers, who would be paid similarly to teachers. Access would be guaranteed, but families with the means to choose other options would be free to do so. And it would be fully paid for with revenue from the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/warrens-push-for-a-wealth-tax-could-be-a-game-changer/2019/01/29/a6beced4-232a-11e9-90cd-dedb0c92dc17_story.html?utm_term=.b1813e220aa5\">wealth tax</a> Warren has called for on households with a net worth greater than $50 million.</p>\n<p>Warren&rsquo;s proposal should spark an overdue and necessary conversation about a problem that leaders in both parties have long neglected. More than half of Americans now live in childcare &ldquo;deserts,&rdquo; <a>according to the Center for American Progress</a>, including significant majorities of rural and Latino families. Compared with the rest of the world, the United States spends pathetically little on <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/socialexp/family-benefits-public-spending.htm\">family benefits</a>, ranking second-to-last among developed nations. &ldquo;This dearth of family benefits leads to two cruel outcomes,&rdquo; writes Matt Bruenig, whose People&rsquo;s Policy Project <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/projects/family-fun-pack/\">recently published</a> its own set of ideas for addressing the childcare crisis. &ldquo;It denies many people the ability to have the families that they want and inflicts financial ruin on many of those who go through with parenthood despite the lack of social support.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>Read the full text of Katrina&rsquo;s column <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/lets-fight-for-universal-child-care/2019/02/26/c2c60422-3913-11e9-a06c-3ec8ed509d15_story.html?utm_term=.672509c0e8b3\">here</a>.</em></p>",

Read the full text of Katrina\u2019s column here.\nSign up for Take Action Now and get three actions in your inbox every week.\nA few weeks ago, Nation columnist Katha Pollitt wrote a compelling New York Times piece endorsing \u201cday care for all.\u201d Noting that childcare is \u201cone of the biggest costs a family faces,\u201d often surpassing even college tuition, Pollitt argued that a lack of affordable childcare is a problem on par with challenges that receive far more attention from leading progressives. \u201cSo why isn\u2019t it on the front burner of the revitalized left?\u201d she asked.\nThe question turned out to be prescient. Last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) unveiled her proposal for universal childcare in the United States. While other candidates have discussed the need for affordable childcare\u2014and it was one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s priorities in 2016\u2014Warren\u2019s plan is clearly the most ambitious proposal to date. It would establish a network of federally funded, locally run childcare centers across the nation. Enrollment would be completely free for millions of children and affordable for all, with the total cost per family capped at 7 percent of a family\u2019s income, no matter the number of kids. The centers would be staffed by qualified care providers, who would be paid similarly to teachers. Access would be guaranteed, but families with the means to choose other options would be free to do so. And it would be fully paid for with revenue from the wealth tax Warren has called for on households with a net worth greater than $50 million.\nWarren\u2019s proposal should spark an overdue and necessary conversation about a problem that leaders in both parties have long neglected. More than half of Americans now live in childcare \u201cdeserts,\u201d according to the Center for American Progress, including significant majorities of rural and Latino families. Compared with the rest of the world, the United States spends pathetically little on family benefits, ranking second-to-last among developed nations. \u201cThis dearth of family benefits leads to two cruel outcomes,\u201d writes Matt Bruenig, whose People\u2019s Policy Project recently published its own set of ideas for addressing the childcare crisis. \u201cIt denies many people the ability to have the families that they want and inflicts financial ruin on many of those who go through with parenthood despite the lack of social support.\u201d\nRead the full text of Katrina\u2019s column here.",

(AP / Michael Nigro)</figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard, read and seen the claims that Medicare for All is bad for the the economy, anti-business, and an attack on the free market. In response, advocates for Medicare for All like myself have instead made the case about the moral urgency of ensuring that everyone has health care, no matter their means.</p>\n<p>But what if Medicare for All is the moral <em>and</em> economically smart course? What if a business-friendly figure, like an entrepreneur, explained that Medicare for All would be one of the best things we could do to create better paying jobs, faster new business growth, and an economy that could better compete in the world market?</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here to tell you. I&rsquo;m an entrepreneur and an investor. I&rsquo;ve helped build companies that have succeeded&mdash;I was a founding investor in Blue Apron and the Co-Founder of <a href=\"http://Aspiration.com\">Aspiration.com</a>, an online financial institution for socially conscious Americans that&rsquo;s quickly grown to about 1 million customers. But I&rsquo;ve also been involved in some companies that have failed. A common denominator of all those experiences is that every business I&rsquo;ve been involved with could hire more and compete better under a Medicare for All health-care system. Not to mention that every worker would have more financial security when their employment isn&rsquo;t literally a matter of life or death.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/bbad3f17-7bc8-4cd2-95de-b353cb660b4b/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=770&height=433\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/4123dc24-a980-4322-a741-1017640965e1/759.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=361&width=642\"></img></figure>\n<p>Right now, American employers are in the health-care business, whether they like it or not. Each year, <a href=\"https://www.ibiweb.org/business-costs-of-poor-health-infographic/\">US employers spend nearly $880 billion on health-care benefits for their employees</a>. In 2019, the total cost of health care, including out-of-pocket costs for employees and dependents, is estimated to <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/employers-adjust-health-benefits-for-2019.aspx\">average $14,800 per employee</a>. Health-care costs are a significant and unpredictable problem for businesses, making it difficult to invest and hire new workers.</p>\n<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t just impact employers. The rapid rise in health-care costs in recent decades has also effectively erased much of workers&rsquo; gains in real wages. Since 2006, <a href=\"https://blog.collectivehealth.com/employer-driven-healthcare-270bfb7ee8c7\">the total cost of health ncare per employee has risen 75 percent</a>, while the median annual salary of a full-time American worker has grown by only 25 percent.</p>\n<p>Every other major industrialized economy in the world has a single-payer health-care system where society at large, through taxes, provides health insurance to everyone. In those economies, businesses don&rsquo;t pay for health insurance, and people don&rsquo;t worry about losing their health care along with their job, because the two aren&rsquo;t connected. In those countries, businesses are able to pay higher wages with money that otherwise would have been spent on health-insurance costs, and people are able to live with more freedom to switch jobs, negotiate for higher wages, or start a business.</p>\n<p>Consider the effect of employer-provided health insurance on people&rsquo;s willingness to fight for higher wages. If your employer controls your access to health care, would you be able to harness the courage to demand a higher wage, knowing your employer could fire you and leave you without health insurance? Probably not. But what if your employer didn&rsquo;t control your health-care access? More often than not, people would be emboldened to ask for higher wages.</p>\n<aside><figure><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cover0217.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\">View our current issue</a></figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>Some will argue that ultimately those who work will end up paying for Medicare for All in the form of higher taxes. In fact, <a href=\"http://pnhp.org/system/assets/drupal/Funding&20HR%20676_Friedman_7.31.13_proofed.pdf\">95 percent of all households would save money under a single-payer system</a>, relative to what they pay now in premiums, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket costs.</p>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s consider entrepreneurship. The American Dream for so many is to start a business, deliver a product or service that people value, and provide good wages for the team that creates it. But that dream is off-limits for so many Americans who fear taking the risk of starting a business for fear that failure could mean losing their access to health care. Imagine how many businesses or inventions haven&rsquo;t been conceived in America because of people&rsquo;s dependence on employer-provided health insurance.</p>\n<p>Medicare for All will give more people freedom to take the risk of being an entrepreneur by removing the risk that they will lose their health insurance in the process. It would reduce the cost of hiring workers, and lower costs for employers by taking them out of the business of buying and providing health coverage.</p>\n<p>It turns out that Medicare for All is the right thing to do for people, and the smart thing to do for our economy. The seven in 10 Americans who support Medicare For All understand that. Now, it&rsquo;s time for our representatives to listen and act.</p>",

                "text": "We\u2019ve all heard, read and seen the claims that Medicare for All is bad for the the economy, anti-business, and an attack on the free market. In response, advocates for Medicare for All like myself have instead made the case about the moral urgency of ensuring that everyone has health care, no matter their means.\nBut what if Medicare for All is the moral and economically smart course? What if a business-friendly figure, like an entrepreneur, explained that Medicare for All would be one of the best things we could do to create better paying jobs, faster new business growth, and an economy that could better compete in the world market?\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here to tell you. I\u2019m an entrepreneur and an investor. I\u2019ve helped build companies that have succeeded\u2014I was a founding investor in Blue Apron and the Co-Founder of Aspiration.com, an online financial institution for socially conscious Americans that\u2019s quickly grown to about 1 million customers. But I\u2019ve also been involved in some companies that have failed. A common denominator of all those experiences is that every business I\u2019ve been involved with could hire more and compete better under a Medicare for All health-care system. Not to mention that every worker would have more financial security when their employment isn\u2019t literally a matter of life or death.\nRight now, American employers are in the health-care business, whether they like it or not. Each year, US employers spend nearly $880 billion on health-care benefits for their employees. In 2019, the total cost of health care, including out-of-pocket costs for employees and dependents, is estimated to average $14,800 per employee. Health-care costs are a significant and unpredictable problem for businesses, making it difficult to invest and hire new workers.\nBut it doesn\u2019t just impact employers. The rapid rise in health-care costs in recent decades has also effectively erased much of workers\u2019 gains in real wages. Since 2006, the total cost of health ncare per employee has risen 75 percent, while the median annual salary of a full-time American worker has grown by only 25 percent.\nEvery other major industrialized economy in the world has a single-payer health-care system where society at large, through taxes, provides health insurance to everyone. In those economies, businesses don\u2019t pay for health insurance, and people don\u2019t worry about losing their health care along with their job, because the two aren\u2019t connected. In those countries, businesses are able to pay higher wages with money that otherwise would have been spent on health-insurance costs, and people are able to live with more freedom to switch jobs, negotiate for higher wages, or start a business.\nConsider the effect of employer-provided health insurance on people\u2019s willingness to fight for higher wages. If your employer controls your access to health care, would you be able to harness the courage to demand a higher wage, knowing your employer could fire you and leave you without health insurance? Probably not. But what if your employer didn\u2019t control your health-care access? More often than not, people would be emboldened to ask for higher wages.\nSome will argue that ultimately those who work will end up paying for Medicare for All in the form of higher taxes. In fact, 95 percent of all households would save money under a single-payer system, relative to what they pay now in premiums, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket costs.\nNow let\u2019s consider entrepreneurship. The American Dream for so many is to start a business, deliver a product or service that people value, and provide good wages for the team that creates it. But that dream is off-limits for so many Americans who fear taking the risk of starting a business for fear that failure could mean losing their access to health care. Imagine how many businesses or inventions haven\u2019t been conceived in America because of people\u2019s dependence on employer-provided health insurance.\nMedicare for All will give more people freedom to take the risk of being an entrepreneur by removing the risk that they will lose their health insurance in the process. It would reduce the cost of hiring workers, and lower costs for employers by taking them out of the business of buying and providing health coverage.\nIt turns out that Medicare for All is the right thing to do for people, and the smart thing to do for our economy. The seven in 10 Americans who support Medicare For All understand that. Now, it\u2019s time for our representatives to listen and act.",

Despite attacks from the leadership in, or around, both parties, over <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/421765-poll-majorities-of-both-parties-support-green-new-deal\">80 percent of voters</a> support the litany of proposals advocated by the House <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres109/BILLS-116hres109ih.pdf\">resolution</a>: job and income guarantees, universal health care, a cleaner environment, and lower socioeconomic inequality. Americans turn out, <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo27316263.html\">yet again</a>, to be far less conservative than elites have maintained over the last half-century.</p>\n<p>Nowhere has the <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3014003?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">gap</a> between majority will and elite consensus been more conspicuous or longstanding than on US foreign policy. Trump&rsquo;s election is perhaps the best demonstration of that fact. But there is strong evidence that most Americans were never &ldquo;liberal internationalists&rdquo; either. While it is notable that support for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/05/after-17-years-of-war-in-afghanistan-more-say-u-s-has-failed-than-succeeded-in-achieving-its-goals/\">has waned</a> in recent years, in <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2017/10/05/3-foreign-policy/3_4-13/\">polls</a> Americans have consistently preferred diplomacy to military &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; before (and not long after) 9/11. Nonetheless, US soldiers and mercenaries are now prosecuting the latter in 80 countries, <a href=\"mailto:https://www.thenation.com/article/america-empire-war-terror-counterterrorism/\">nearly half the planet</a>.</p>\n<p>This situation has prompted the left to call <a href=\"mailto:https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300223873/foreign-policy-left\">for a comprehensive alternative in US foreign policy</a>. But the question remains, how, exactly, the left can make inroads against the &ldquo;American empire,&rdquo; as it is now casually described even on the right. Any talk of dramatically changing foreign policy must give serious attention to reforming the institutions shaping it. In part, that means creating organizations to compete with the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374280031\">foreign-policy establishment</a>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/matt-duss-bernie-sanders-foreign-policy-blob/\">the blob</a>,&rdquo; to use its apt nickname. But the left might also do well to consider another idea that has fallen into obscurity: converting the military-industrial complex to peacetime work.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/bbad3f17-7bc8-4cd2-95de-b353cb660b4b/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=770&height=433\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/4123dc24-a980-4322-a741-1017640965e1/759.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=361&width=642\"></img></figure>\n<p>Since the end of the Cold War, the military has seemingly become &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-Everything-Became-War-and-the-Military-Became-Everything/Rosa-Brooks/9781476777870\">everything</a>&rdquo;&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2015/11/dod-pays-premium-for-gas-station-in-afghanistan/\">gas-station operators</a> in Afghanistan, concert promoters in Africa, and now, potential contractors to build Trump&rsquo;s wall. Yet the defense industry has gone unchecked, even as the evidence is clear that it has <a href=\"https://www.counterpunch.org/2006/07/06/nationalize-the-defense-industry/\">corrupted the democratic process</a>. Just as the popularity of the Green New Deal&mdash;and its focus on the job guarantee&mdash;can help us fight global warming, so too might it go a long way toward humanizing our foreign policy and creating a better economy.</p>\n<p>Defense conversion is most closely associated with South Dakota Democrat and 1972 presidential candidate George McGovern, who made it his signature issue in Congress. A recession in the mid-1950s and the military cuts following the Cuban missile crisis gave him the opportunity to push the idea through the Senate, and in 1964 he called for a National Economic Conversion Commission (NECC) that would oversee the work. McGovern wanted to get the defense industry out of job creation, recognizing, as many liberal and conservative elites did privately, that the military-industrial complex was essentially a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/12/19/green-new-deal-congress-history-mcgovern-223315\">gigantic WPA</a>.&rdquo; McGovern also wanted to free up hundreds of millions of federal monies for domestic welfare, to shore up the welfare state. But the Vietnam War killed the project, as his fellow Democrats denounced him as a &ldquo;radical&rdquo; in the middle of a war.</p>\n<p>McGovern drew his ideas from the Columbia economist Seymour Melman, who made defense conversion his lifelong project. In his most famous book, <em>The Permanent War Economy</em> (1974), Melman argued that the military economy was a form of &ldquo;state capitalism&rdquo; whose &ldquo;relentlessly predatory effects&rdquo; had caused America&rsquo;s economic decline. Melman brought an economists&rsquo; predilection for statistics and an activist&rsquo;s zeal to what he called &ldquo;Pentagon capitalism.&rdquo; Americans, he insisted, had to eliminate unnecessary military spending if they wanted to prevent any future &ldquo;Vietnam-type interventions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Melman had a comprehensive vision for defense conversion. He thought a combination of community-based groups, alternative-use committees, and federal mandates (such as a revitalized NECC) to enforce conversion could lead the country out of the war economy. The military-industrial complex, he argued, had robbed Americans of a manufacturing-based economy, with stable wages for the working class. The result was a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Profits_Without_Production.html?id=g8ixAAAAIAAJ\">post-industrial economy</a>&rdquo; where wealth was stratified, jobs were scarce, and a few wealthy elites controlled the labor of most workers. It was the <a href=\"https://www.counterpunch.org/2018/01/02/more-power-to-the-workers-the-political-economy-of-seymour-melman/\">inequality</a> produced by the military-industrial complex, he felt, that was the true tragedy of the Cold War, not just military adventurism and bloated defense budgets.</p>\n<aside><figure><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cover0217.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\">View our current issue</a></figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>How Melman&rsquo;s conversion plans would have solved the issue of <em>donor</em> pressure&mdash;of Pentagon lobbying&mdash;remained a question, however, even without Vietnam. Melman&rsquo;s answer to this problem was to &ldquo;send representatives to Congress who would reflect a nonmilitarist organization,&rdquo; but even the most liberal Democrats were consistently opposed to military cuts in their districts, as they would be in later decades. The problem of the profit motive for military contractors, and how military profits insidiously influenced electoral politics and politicians (ones who aimed to squash conversion efforts), plagued reformers of the military-industrial complex.</p>\n<p>The solution was left to Harvard&rsquo;s John Kenneth Galbraith, who had a grander vision for defense conversion: nationalizing the military-industrial complex. His argument was straightforward. Arms manufacturers depended on Washington: Congress funded the research and development. Privately made weapons also routinely underperformed, and <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=sKYeAQAAMAAJ&q=The+C-5A+scandal&dq=The+C-5A+scandal&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJ5uuGusXgAhUNPN8KHSk0B2EQ6AEIKDAA\">cost far more than estimated</a>. By converting these already highly concentrated, essentially public firms into governmental nonprofits, Galbraith believed voters could &ldquo;substantially civilize the incentive structure.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Obviously, nationalizing arms production would not (immediately) eliminate the military-industrial complex. Like Eisenhower, Galbraith understood that private &ldquo;merchants of war&rdquo; were no more puppet masters than were generals, shadowy CIA directors, or presidents. All pushed for greater internationalism; all saw their powers, and budgets, grow enormously. But the only real way to shrink the military-industrial complex, to eliminate the <em>private</em> incentives for increased military spending, lay in severing the connections of for-profit business to national security. Nationalization was thus a necessary first step, before any systematic plan for conversion might be implemented.</p>\n<p>Galbraith expected the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1969/11/16/archives/the-big-defense-firms-are-really-public-firms-and-should-be.html\">proposal</a> to get attention. (Liberals, he said, were finally beginning to show &ldquo;a certain minimum of courage&rdquo; about the Pentagon.) Instead&hellip; nothing. Conservatives, unironically, cried socialism. Moderates dismissed it as &ldquo;fantastic.&rdquo; Paul Nitze, the main author of NSC-68, said voters and politicians would never stand for it: The Pentagon was too important to America&rsquo;s economy. Former secretary of state Dean Acheson crowed that Galbraith must have fallen under the spell of anti-war radicals. But letters poured in reporting enormous waste and support&mdash;from defense-industry workers.</p>\n<p>Galbraith&rsquo;s (and Melman&rsquo;s) biggest supporters in the 1970s were labor unions. Indeed, despite the AFL-CIO&rsquo;s deep involvement with Cold War foreign policy and support for the Vietnam War, union leaders such as the UAW&rsquo;s Walter Reuther and the Machinists&rsquo; William Winpisinger backed the idea of conversion to a civilian economy. Over 1,000 labor figures even sponsored a &ldquo;labor for peace&rdquo; forum in 1972, demanding an end to American involvement in Vietnam and &ldquo;to turn our country from the path of killing and destruction to the path of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness through peace, dignity, and <a href=\"https://shsmo.org/manuscripts/stlouis/s0426.pdf\">full employment</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But little changed. Even as Democrats became the more dovish party, few championed conversion. Meanwhile, the defense industry mirrored <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Dismantling_the_cold_war_economy.html?id=6-viaq8yyLkC\">larger economic trends</a>: declines in manufacturing, wage cuts, and a shift to white-collar labor. Austerity reinforced militarism at home, as defense jobs, with their good pay and benefits, disappeared&mdash;to much local anger. Nationally, however, support for more Vietnams remained low, despite a very loud chorus of bipartisan elites advocating incursions in <a href=\"https://www.uncpress.org/book/9780807854648/conflicting-missions/\">Africa</a> and <a href=\"http://americanempireproject.com/empires-workshop/\">Latin America</a> in the name of anti-communism.</p>\n<p>Reagan&rsquo;s election in 1980 and his subsequent military buildup postponed defense conversion indefinitely. New York Democratic Representative Ted Weiss&mdash;who, like McGovern, was a discipline of Melman&mdash;consistently proposed conversion legislation once in office after 1977. House majority leader (and later speaker) Jim Wright remained committed to Weiss&rsquo;s legislation for much of his tenure; but Reagan, congressional Republicans, and the Department of Defense killed Weiss&rsquo;s (and Wright&rsquo;s) bills by the mid-1980s.</p>\n<p>The unexpected collapse of the Soviet Union forced conversion back onto the table. A series of grassroots campaigns with names such as the Arizona Council for Economic Conversion and the Coalition to Stop the Trident (many of them led by volunteers) waged across the country in the late 1980s and early 1990s pushed for alternative sources of revenue to the Pentagon. Faced with these pressures, 1992 presidential candidate Bill Clinton, who started his political career with McGovern, expressed interest in cutting defense to invest in transportation infrastructure, including &ldquo;a high-speed rail network.&rdquo;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Captives-Cold-War-Economy-Communities/dp/B000J6HZE4\"> Yet again</a>, however, liberals and conservatives proved no different in government, voting to keep the military-industrial complex going, even though the United States had become the world&rsquo;s first truly uncontested superpower.</p>\n<p>It <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shadows-American-Century-Decline-Dispatch/dp/1608467732\">remains such</a>. And yet the complex has grown <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Betrayed-Surveillance-Security-State-ebook/dp/B01N5B6RIS\">exponentially</a>.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, potential countervailing forces remain. Considering the overwhelming support for the Green New Deal, which cleverly seeks to reduce global warming through full employment, the left might do well to ground its foreign-policy visions in reform of the military-industrial complex itself. Direct job-creation programs have always been popular, despite opposition from Republican and (<a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/148388/long-tortured-history-job-guarantee\">more often</a>) Democratic elites. The idea of establishing a public option, as it were, for unprofitable but economically productive and socially valuable work has also consistently won remarkable majorities. Herein lies an opportunity for proponents of the Green New Deal to regulate military contractors and finance job growth by converting the military-industrial complex to peaceful ends.</p>\n<p>Galbraith&rsquo;s idea of nationalizing the industry, likewise, offers a practical means for curbing the enormous pressure that military spending bears on elections. In so doing, it also holds out the promise of changing the huge gap between the public and the elite on US foreign policy. Because it is a private industry, free to lobby, Pentagon contractors reinforce the bipartisan echo chamber, from hiring ex-military brass and pundits without diplomatic or scholarly backgrounds to dominate the media conversation, to funding the &ldquo;think tanks&rdquo; on which Democratic and Republican presidents rely. The military-industrial complex is not just a product of the &ldquo;foreign-policy establishment.&rdquo; It protects and strengthens that establishment. It has served as too great a barrel of pork for elected officials, well-heeled donors, and (more understandably) US workers&mdash;so much that private contractors, now, reap almost <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/opinion/democratic-party-cortez-foreign-policy.html\">50 percent of the military budget</a>. Any effort to reform this &ldquo;industry,&rdquo; to figure out how it can be a slave, not a master, of the public interest, is crucial. And conversion (via nationalization) might be one.</p>",

                "text": "If you needed further proof of Bernie Sanders\u2019s argument that most Americans stand with him on the issues, consider the reaction to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal. Despite attacks from the leadership in, or around, both parties, over 80 percent of voters support the litany of proposals advocated by the House resolution: job and income guarantees, universal health care, a cleaner environment, and lower socioeconomic inequality. Americans turn out, yet again, to be far less conservative than elites have maintained over the last half-century.\nNowhere has the gap between majority will and elite consensus been more conspicuous or longstanding than on US foreign policy. Trump\u2019s election is perhaps the best demonstration of that fact. But there is strong evidence that most Americans were never \u201cliberal internationalists\u201d either. While it is notable that support for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has waned in recent years, in polls Americans have consistently preferred diplomacy to military \u201csolutions\u201d before (and not long after) 9/11. Nonetheless, US soldiers and mercenaries are now prosecuting the latter in 80 countries, nearly half the planet.\nThis situation has prompted the left to call for a comprehensive alternative in US foreign policy. But the question remains, how, exactly, the left can make inroads against the \u201cAmerican empire,\u201d as it is now casually described even on the right. Any talk of dramatically changing foreign policy must give serious attention to reforming the institutions shaping it. In part, that means creating organizations to compete with the \u201cforeign-policy establishment\u201d\u2014\u201cthe blob,\u201d to use its apt nickname. But the left might also do well to consider another idea that has fallen into obscurity: converting the military-industrial complex to peacetime work.\nSince the end of the Cold War, the military has seemingly become \u201ceverything\u201d\u2014gas-station operators in Afghanistan, concert promoters in Africa, and now, potential contractors to build Trump\u2019s wall. Yet the defense industry has gone unchecked, even as the evidence is clear that it has corrupted the democratic process. Just as the popularity of the Green New Deal\u2014and its focus on the job guarantee\u2014can help us fight global warming, so too might it go a long way toward humanizing our foreign policy and creating a better economy.\nDefense conversion is most closely associated with South Dakota Democrat and 1972 presidential candidate George McGovern, who made it his signature issue in Congress. A recession in the mid-1950s and the military cuts following the Cuban missile crisis gave him the opportunity to push the idea through the Senate, and in 1964 he called for a National Economic Conversion Commission (NECC) that would oversee the work. McGovern wanted to get the defense industry out of job creation, recognizing, as many liberal and conservative elites did privately, that the military-industrial complex was essentially a \u201cgigantic WPA.\u201d McGovern also wanted to free up hundreds of millions of federal monies for domestic welfare, to shore up the welfare state. But the Vietnam War killed the project, as his fellow Democrats denounced him as a \u201cradical\u201d in the middle of a war.\nMcGovern drew his ideas from the Columbia economist Seymour Melman, who made defense conversion his lifelong project. In his most famous book, The Permanent War Economy (1974), Melman argued that the military economy was a form of \u201cstate capitalism\u201d whose \u201crelentlessly predatory effects\u201d had caused America\u2019s economic decline. Melman brought an economists\u2019 predilection for statistics and an activist\u2019s zeal to what he called \u201cPentagon capitalism.\u201d Americans, he insisted, had to eliminate unnecessary military spending if they wanted to prevent any future \u201cVietnam-type interventions.\u201d\nMelman had a comprehensive vision for defense conversion. He thought a combination of community-based groups, alternative-use committees, and federal mandates (such as a revitalized NECC) to enforce conversion could lead the country out of the war economy. The military-industrial complex, he argued, had robbed Americans of a manufacturing-based economy, with stable wages for the working class. The result was a \u201cpost-industrial economy\u201d where wealth was stratified, jobs were scarce, and a few wealthy elites controlled the labor of most workers. It was the inequality produced by the military-industrial complex, he felt, that was the true tragedy of the Cold War, not just military adventurism and bloated defense budgets.\nHow Melman\u2019s conversion plans would have solved the issue of donor pressure\u2014of Pentagon lobbying\u2014remained a question, however, even without Vietnam. Melman\u2019s answer to this problem was to \u201csend representatives to Congress who would reflect a nonmilitarist organization,\u201d but even the most liberal Democrats were consistently opposed to military cuts in their districts, as they would be in later decades. The problem of the profit motive for military contractors, and how military profits insidiously influenced electoral politics and politicians (ones who aimed to squash conversion efforts), plagued reformers of the military-industrial complex.\nThe solution was left to Harvard\u2019s John Kenneth Galbraith, who had a grander vision for defense conversion: nationalizing the military-industrial complex. His argument was straightforward. Arms manufacturers depended on Washington: Congress funded the research and development. Privately made weapons also routinely underperformed, and cost far more than estimated. By converting these already highly concentrated, essentially public firms into governmental nonprofits, Galbraith believed voters could \u201csubstantially civilize the incentive structure.\u201d\nObviously, nationalizing arms production would not (immediately) eliminate the military-industrial complex. Like Eisenhower, Galbraith understood that private \u201cmerchants of war\u201d were no more puppet masters than were generals, shadowy CIA directors, or presidents. All pushed for greater internationalism; all saw their powers, and budgets, grow enormously. But the only real way to shrink the military-industrial complex, to eliminate the private incentives for increased military spending, lay in severing the connections of for-profit business to national security. Nationalization was thus a necessary first step, before any systematic plan for conversion might be implemented.\nGalbraith expected the proposal to get attention. (Liberals, he said, were finally beginning to show \u201ca certain minimum of courage\u201d about the Pentagon.) Instead\u2026 nothing. Conservatives, unironically, cried socialism. Moderates dismissed it as \u201cfantastic.\u201d Paul Nitze, the main author of NSC-68, said voters and politicians would never stand for it: The Pentagon was too important to America\u2019s economy. Former secretary of state Dean Acheson crowed that Galbraith must have fallen under the spell of anti-war radicals. But letters poured in reporting enormous waste and support\u2014from defense-industry workers.\nGalbraith\u2019s (and Melman\u2019s) biggest supporters in the 1970s were labor unions. Indeed, despite the AFL-CIO\u2019s deep involvement with Cold War foreign policy and support for the Vietnam War, union leaders such as the UAW\u2019s Walter Reuther and the Machinists\u2019 William Winpisinger backed the idea of conversion to a civilian economy. Over 1,000 labor figures even sponsored a \u201clabor for peace\u201d forum in 1972, demanding an end to American involvement in Vietnam and \u201cto turn our country from the path of killing and destruction to the path of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness through peace, dignity, and full employment.\u201d\nBut little changed. Even as Democrats became the more dovish party, few championed conversion. Meanwhile, the defense industry mirrored larger economic trends: declines in manufacturing, wage cuts, and a shift to white-collar labor. Austerity reinforced militarism at home, as defense jobs, with their good pay and benefits, disappeared\u2014to much local anger. Nationally, however, support for more Vietnams remained low, despite a very loud chorus of bipartisan elites advocating incursions in Africa and Latin America in the name of anti-communism.\nReagan\u2019s election in 1980 and his subsequent military buildup postponed defense conversion indefinitely. New York Democratic Representative Ted Weiss\u2014who, like McGovern, was a discipline of Melman\u2014consistently proposed conversion legislation once in office after 1977. House majority leader (and later speaker) Jim Wright remained committed to Weiss\u2019s legislation for much of his tenure; but Reagan, congressional Republicans, and the Department of Defense killed Weiss\u2019s (and Wright\u2019s) bills by the mid-1980s.\nThe unexpected collapse of the Soviet Union forced conversion back onto the table. A series of grassroots campaigns with names such as the Arizona Council for Economic Conversion and the Coalition to Stop the Trident (many of them led by volunteers) waged across the country in the late 1980s and early 1990s pushed for alternative sources of revenue to the Pentagon. Faced with these pressures, 1992 presidential candidate Bill Clinton, who started his political career with McGovern, expressed interest in cutting defense to invest in transportation infrastructure, including \u201ca high-speed rail network.\u201d Yet again, however, liberals and conservatives proved no different in government, voting to keep the military-industrial complex going, even though the United States had become the world\u2019s first truly uncontested superpower.\nIt remains such. And yet the complex has grown exponentially.\nNonetheless, potential countervailing forces remain. Considering the overwhelming support for the Green New Deal, which cleverly seeks to reduce global warming through full employment, the left might do well to ground its foreign-policy visions in reform of the military-industrial complex itself. Direct job-creation programs have always been popular, despite opposition from Republican and (more often) Democratic elites. The idea of establishing a public option, as it were, for unprofitable but economically productive and socially valuable work has also consistently won remarkable majorities. Herein lies an opportunity for proponents of the Green New Deal to regulate military contractors and finance job growth by converting the military-industrial complex to peaceful ends.\nGalbraith\u2019s idea of nationalizing the industry, likewise, offers a practical means for curbing the enormous pressure that military spending bears on elections. In so doing, it also holds out the promise of changing the huge gap between the public and the elite on US foreign policy. Because it is a private industry, free to lobby, Pentagon contractors reinforce the bipartisan echo chamber, from hiring ex-military brass and pundits without diplomatic or scholarly backgrounds to dominate the media conversation, to funding the \u201cthink tanks\u201d on which Democratic and Republican presidents rely. The military-industrial complex is not just a product of the \u201cforeign-policy establishment.\u201d It protects and strengthens that establishment. It has served as too great a barrel of pork for elected officials, well-heeled donors, and (more understandably) US workers\u2014so much that private contractors, now, reap almost 50 percent of the military budget. Any effort to reform this \u201cindustry,\u201d to figure out how it can be a slave, not a master, of the public interest, is crucial. And conversion (via nationalization) might be one.",

It&rsquo;s really about multitasking. It&rsquo;s about understanding that we are in a time of multiple overlapping crises, and that we are on an incredibly tight deadline when it comes to lowering greenhouse-gas emissions in time to prevent truly catastrophic warming. In order to bring people along with these necessary changes, there have to be benefits in the here-and-now in terms of the kinds of jobs that are provided and the justice that comes through.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/bbad3f17-7bc8-4cd2-95de-b353cb660b4b/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=770&height=433\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/4123dc24-a980-4322-a741-1017640965e1/759.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=361&width=642\"></img></figure>\n<p><strong>JW: The Green New Deal, you&rsquo;ve said, is not a question that will be settled through elections alone. What do you mean?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>NK:</strong> In terms of winning the power to introduce a package as ambitious as the resolution, the only real historical precedent is the original New Deal. And the political dynamics that produced the original New Deal were not a benevolent politician handing reforms down from on high, from the goodness of his heart. Of course it mattered to have FDR in power instead of Herbert Hoover, but it mattered even more to have an organized population which was flexing its muscles in every conceivable way in the 1930s&mdash;from sit-down strikes in auto plants, to shutting down the ports on the West Coast, to shutting down entire cities with general strikes. And it mattered also to have more radical voices who were calling for more radical policies than the New Deal was offering, like a truly cooperative economy. All of that created the context in which FDR was able to sell the New Deal to elites. They were grudging about it, but the alternative seemed to be political revolution.</p>\n<p>So the only way that something like this happens is if it is accompanied by a huge grassroots mobilization, where every workplace, every sector, every movement is asking, &ldquo;What would a Green New Deal mean for us? What would it mean in our workplace? What would it mean for the groups that we represent?&rdquo; If we are going to succeed, they need to make it their own. So it&rsquo;s going to take a hell of a lot of grassroots organizing, mobilizing all of these sectors to really believe that the Green New Deal is going to make their lives better, coupled with politicians running at every level of government, including for president, with a promise to enact this on day one.</p>\n<p><strong>JW: Building political power, you&rsquo;ve said, is about changing the calculus of what is possible. That&rsquo;s a big obstacle. We saw that in a column by Gail Collins in <em>The New York Times</em> last week: She argued the Green New Deal is too far-reaching and instead we should focus our efforts on more manageable things like creating more electric generating capacity from solar and wind. It&rsquo;s not exactly opposing the Green New Deal, but it&rsquo;s certainly not helping.</strong></p>\n<aside> <figure><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cover0217.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\">View our current issue</a></figcaption></figure> </aside>\n<p><strong>NK:</strong> There is this idea that a more incrementalist policy focused just on climate would be more sellable&mdash;something that doesn&rsquo;t talk about fighting inequality, and a huge jobs program, and health care for all. But what&rsquo;s actually stood in the way of strong climate policy in the past has been that, in times of real economic stress, like the ones we&rsquo;ve been living in, people consistently rank climate below health care and below jobs. Often it ranks last on the list of political priorities. And that&rsquo;s why politicians always feel that it can be sacrificed. Obama did that. He looked at the polls and he prioritized health care. And when that led to a huge amount of pushback, he didn&rsquo;t spend any political capital trying to get a cap-and-trade policy through&mdash;even though that was totally inadequate.</p>\n<p>And the other thing that stands in the way when politicians actually do introduce climate policies, is that, if they don&rsquo;t prioritize justice, the proposals are actively unjust. For example, look to Emmanuel Macron in France, where this very neoliberal president introduced a tax cut for the very, very rich at the same time that he introduced a carbon-pricing scheme that increased the cost of living for working people. Then you had an uprising, and rioting in the streets, with the yellow vest movement&mdash;precisely because, as one of the protesters put it, &ldquo;The politicians care about the end of the world when we have to care about the end of the month.&rdquo; I think the brilliance of the Green New Deal framework is that it doesn&rsquo;t ask people to choose. It says, &ldquo;We all care about the end of the world. But we also care about the end of the month. So how do we design policies that simultaneously lower emissions and lower that economic strain?&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s exactly what they&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>\n<p><strong>JW: There has been opposition to climate change legislation from the Laborers International Union and some of the building trades. But one of the unions that&rsquo;s been really good on this is the Canadian Union of Postal Workers. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>NK:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been involved in a project in Canada called the Leap Manifesto, which is our people&rsquo;s version of a Green New Deal, to get off fossil fuels in a hurry, but to put justice and labor protections at the center. After the Leap Manifesto came out, our team worked with that union, at their request, to come up with a <a href=\"http://www.deliveringcommunitypower.ca/\">plan</a> to apply the principles of the Leap Manifesto to the Post Office&mdash;which, at that time, was facing a very real prospect of being privatized and radically downsized. So rather than just saying, &ldquo;We want to keep things as they are, despite the fact that how we tend to send mail has been radically changed by Amazon and by courier services,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;We want to change this service that has been at the center of communities for so long, and we want to now be at the center of a transition off of fossil fuels. We want to have postal banking, we want to have solar panels on the rooftops of every post office, we want a charging station outside, we want a fleet of vehicles that are all electric and all made domestically, and we want not just to be delivering the mail, but also to be delivering locally grown produce, checking in on the elderly, being part of the caring economy.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a radical plan that&rsquo;s being championed by an unabashedly progressive union. And coming back to where we started, that&rsquo;s what it means to make the Green New Deal your own. We need people in every organized workplace to be getting together and imagining what their workplace would look like if they took rapid de-carbonization seriously. And asking how could it improve lives? How could it lead to a fairer economy?</p>",

                "text": "Naomi Klein is the author of the best sellers No Is Not Enough, This Changes Everything, The Shock Doctrine, and No Logo. She\u2019s a member of the board of directors of the international climate-action group 350.org. And she\u2019s a senior correspondent for the Intercept, a contributor to The Nation, and the Gloria Steinem Chair in Media, Culture and Feminist Studies at Rutgers University.\nListen to Naomi Klein on the Start Making Sense podcast.\nJon Wiener: How would you describe the Green New Deal resolution introduced by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey?\nNaomi Klein: It\u2019s a sweeping plan to radically transform how we get energy, move ourselves around, live in cities, and grow our food; and it puts justice at the center\u2014justice broadly defined, from racial and gender justice to making sure no worker is left behind, battling inequality at every level. It\u2019s really about multitasking. It\u2019s about understanding that we are in a time of multiple overlapping crises, and that we are on an incredibly tight deadline when it comes to lowering greenhouse-gas emissions in time to prevent truly catastrophic warming. In order to bring people along with these necessary changes, there have to be benefits in the here-and-now in terms of the kinds of jobs that are provided and the justice that comes through.\nJW: The Green New Deal, you\u2019ve said, is not a question that will be settled through elections alone. What do you mean?\nNK: In terms of winning the power to introduce a package as ambitious as the resolution, the only real historical precedent is the original New Deal. And the political dynamics that produced the original New Deal were not a benevolent politician handing reforms down from on high, from the goodness of his heart. Of course it mattered to have FDR in power instead of Herbert Hoover, but it mattered even more to have an organized population which was flexing its muscles in every conceivable way in the 1930s\u2014from sit-down strikes in auto plants, to shutting down the ports on the West Coast, to shutting down entire cities with general strikes. And it mattered also to have more radical voices who were calling for more radical policies than the New Deal was offering, like a truly cooperative economy. All of that created the context in which FDR was able to sell the New Deal to elites. They were grudging about it, but the alternative seemed to be political revolution.\nSo the only way that something like this happens is if it is accompanied by a huge grassroots mobilization, where every workplace, every sector, every movement is asking, \u201cWhat would a Green New Deal mean for us? What would it mean in our workplace? What would it mean for the groups that we represent?\u201d If we are going to succeed, they need to make it their own. So it\u2019s going to take a hell of a lot of grassroots organizing, mobilizing all of these sectors to really believe that the Green New Deal is going to make their lives better, coupled with politicians running at every level of government, including for president, with a promise to enact this on day one.\nJW: Building political power, you\u2019ve said, is about changing the calculus of what is possible. That\u2019s a big obstacle. We saw that in a column by Gail Collins in The New York Times last week: She argued the Green New Deal is too far-reaching and instead we should focus our efforts on more manageable things like creating more electric generating capacity from solar and wind. It\u2019s not exactly opposing the Green New Deal, but it\u2019s certainly not helping.\nNK: There is this idea that a more incrementalist policy focused just on climate would be more sellable\u2014something that doesn\u2019t talk about fighting inequality, and a huge jobs program, and health care for all. But what\u2019s actually stood in the way of strong climate policy in the past has been that, in times of real economic stress, like the ones we\u2019ve been living in, people consistently rank climate below health care and below jobs. Often it ranks last on the list of political priorities. And that\u2019s why politicians always feel that it can be sacrificed. Obama did that. He looked at the polls and he prioritized health care. And when that led to a huge amount of pushback, he didn\u2019t spend any political capital trying to get a cap-and-trade policy through\u2014even though that was totally inadequate.\nAnd the other thing that stands in the way when politicians actually do introduce climate policies, is that, if they don\u2019t prioritize justice, the proposals are actively unjust. For example, look to Emmanuel Macron in France, where this very neoliberal president introduced a tax cut for the very, very rich at the same time that he introduced a carbon-pricing scheme that increased the cost of living for working people. Then you had an uprising, and rioting in the streets, with the yellow vest movement\u2014precisely because, as one of the protesters put it, \u201cThe politicians care about the end of the world when we have to care about the end of the month.\u201d I think the brilliance of the Green New Deal framework is that it doesn\u2019t ask people to choose. It says, \u201cWe all care about the end of the world. But we also care about the end of the month. So how do we design policies that simultaneously lower emissions and lower that economic strain?\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re trying to do.\nJW: There has been opposition to climate change legislation from the Laborers International Union and some of the building trades. But one of the unions that\u2019s been really good on this is the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.\nNK: I\u2019ve been involved in a project in Canada called the Leap Manifesto, which is our people\u2019s version of a Green New Deal, to get off fossil fuels in a hurry, but to put justice and labor protections at the center. After the Leap Manifesto came out, our team worked with that union, at their request, to come up with a plan to apply the principles of the Leap Manifesto to the Post Office\u2014which, at that time, was facing a very real prospect of being privatized and radically downsized. So rather than just saying, \u201cWe want to keep things as they are, despite the fact that how we tend to send mail has been radically changed by Amazon and by courier services,\u201d they said, \u201cWe want to change this service that has been at the center of communities for so long, and we want to now be at the center of a transition off of fossil fuels. We want to have postal banking, we want to have solar panels on the rooftops of every post office, we want a charging station outside, we want a fleet of vehicles that are all electric and all made domestically, and we want not just to be delivering the mail, but also to be delivering locally grown produce, checking in on the elderly, being part of the caring economy.\u201d It\u2019s a radical plan that\u2019s being championed by an unabashedly progressive union. And coming back to where we started, that\u2019s what it means to make the Green New Deal your own. We need people in every organized workplace to be getting together and imagining what their workplace would look like if they took rapid de-carbonization seriously. And asking how could it improve lives? How could it lead to a fairer economy?",

White parents are intent on zoning them out of the district. (Tamika Moore)</figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>One night in 2017, Leslie Williams saw a post on Facebook about a meeting later that evening at Gardendale City Hall. Gardendale, a predominately white city in Alabama, had put forward a proposal to split from the Jefferson County School District, which enrolls a student body that is majority black and Latino. If Gardendale&rsquo;s plan were successful, Williams&mdash;who&rsquo;d graduated from Gardendale High School and always dreamed of sending her three kids there&mdash;would instead be forced to enroll them in lower-performing schools farther from her home.</p>\n<p>She stood in front of the packed hearing room that night and decided to turn her back on the school-board members up at the dais and speak directly to fellow parents. &ldquo;The options they&rsquo;ve given us are schools that are already overcrowded,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Like you, I just want my children to have the best.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Two years ago, <em>The Hechinger Report</em> and <em>The Nation</em> published <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/the-department-of-justice-is-overseeing-the-resegregation-of-american-schools/\">an investigation of Gardendale&rsquo;s efforts</a> to secede from Jefferson County to form a whiter, wealthier school district that excluded diverse neighborhoods like the one where Williams lived. Now, a <a href=\"https://edbuild.org/content/fractured\">new report</a> from EdBuild, a nonprofit that advocates for equitable school funding, shows just how common school-secession efforts have become.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/bbad3f17-7bc8-4cd2-95de-b353cb660b4b/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=770&height=433\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/4123dc24-a980-4322-a741-1017640965e1/759.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=361&width=642\"></img></figure>\n<p>Between 2000 and 2016, 63 communities split off from their existing school districts to form new ones. In just the last two years, 10 more communities have followed. Most of the new districts are more affluent, and less racially diverse, than those they left behind. Another 16 communities are actively exploring efforts to form their own school districts, according to the report.</p>\n<p>This form of educational gerrymandering has proven to be a winning strategy to concentrate property-tax dollars and hoard educational opportunities. And it leaves those districts that have been abandoned with fewer dollars to serve an even needier student body.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Sibilia, EdBuild&rsquo;s CEO, cites a few reasons for the accelerating school-breakaway movement. In racially diverse parts of the country like Alabama, the desire of white parents to move their children into whiter, wealthier schools has been the driving factor, she said. But the report also documents similar efforts in virtually all-white parts of the country, where well-off districts flee larger, poorer ones.</p>\n<p>For example, Maine is home to the majority of the 10 new school secessions. In that state, a 2007 law incentivized school districts to merge as a way to save money amid declining student enrollment. Originally, school districts would be hit with financial penalties if they didn&rsquo;t consolidate, but shortly after taking office in 2011, Republican Governor Paul LePage signed a bill repealing those penalties. Since then, Maine districts have been breaking away from larger districts, with eight communities seceding in just the last two years. On average, these new districts are wealthier than the ones they left. Elsewhere in the country, mega-rich communities have tried to secede from the merely wealthy, as is the case in Los Angeles County, California, where Malibu has proposed splitting from Santa Monica.</p>\n<aside><figure><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cover0217.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\">View our current issue</a></figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>Sibilia says the school-secession movement illustrates the problems with the way US schools are funded. &ldquo;Even when there is not explicit racial intent, there is this hyperlocalism approach to education that is driving these secessions,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Either way it&rsquo;s emblematic of everything that is wrong with school funding and school borders in this country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Nationwide, nearly half of education spending comes from local sources, mostly in the form of property taxes. Often, so-called &ldquo;good&rdquo; school districts enjoy some of the highest property tax revenue-to-student ratios in the country. For instance, Newton, Massachusetts, which is home to roughly 90,000 residents and has 13,000 children enrolled in its public schools, collects more property tax revenue than Detroit, which enrolls far more students. Newton&rsquo;s schools are among the best-regarded in the country, whereas Detroit schools often struggle just to provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment.</p>\n<p>Newton isn&rsquo;t a breakaway district, but Sibilia says it&rsquo;s the kind of exclusive educational enclave that school secessionists seek to create. &ldquo;School funding is creating a caste system,&rdquo; she said. The ability to redraw school boundaries and cordon off property tax revenue, she said, &ldquo;has segregated kids, created inefficiencies and hoarded wealth.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, some states are making it easier for communities to do just that. In total, 30 states have laws permitting towns and neighborhoods to form their own school districts, and in recent years, some have gone a few steps further. In December 2018, Indiana&rsquo;s State Board of Education released a memo reinterpreting existing laws to streamline the state&rsquo;s onerous school secession process. That same year, lawmakers in North Carolina passed a bill allowing four affluent suburban communities outside Charlotte to start charter schools that would be open only to their residents. Lawmakers also approved a bill giving municipalities the ability to restrict some of their property tax revenue to the schools in their city limits instead of spending it on the larger countywide school district that currently serves these communities. Taken together, these laws could result in the creation of four new, predominately white and affluent charter school districts operating outside the diverse Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Parents aren&rsquo;t necessarily the bad guys here,&rdquo; said Sibilia. &ldquo;Parents are going to want the best for their kids. The problem is state laws that don&rsquo;t ensure that all kids have access to the best.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Indeed, there is little to stop most communities from seceding.</p>\n<p>Last year, a federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled that Gardendale could not form its own school district. The judges cited a lower court finding that the attempted split was racially motivated, which placed Gardendale in violation of a federal school desegregation order stemming from the 1954 <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> decision. (Leaders of the Gardendale secession movement deny that their proposal was racially motivated.) The desegregation order is still in place in that part of Alabama.</p>\n<p>It was a big win, Sibilia acknowledges. But Gardendale is one of just a handful of communities still under the federal desegregation order.</p>\n<p>In most of the country&mdash;where no court order applies&mdash;the secession movement continues unchecked.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This story has been updated to reflect a change made by EdBuild to its analysis of a secession effort in Malibu, California. That secession process is ongoing.</em></p>",

                "text": "One night in 2017, Leslie Williams saw a post on Facebook about a meeting later that evening at Gardendale City Hall. Gardendale, a predominately white city in Alabama, had put forward a proposal to split from the Jefferson County School District, which enrolls a student body that is majority black and Latino. If Gardendale\u2019s plan were successful, Williams\u2014who\u2019d graduated from Gardendale High School and always dreamed of sending her three kids there\u2014would instead be forced to enroll them in lower-performing schools farther from her home.\nShe stood in front of the packed hearing room that night and decided to turn her back on the school-board members up at the dais and speak directly to fellow parents. \u201cThe options they\u2019ve given us are schools that are already overcrowded,\u201d she said. \u201cLike you, I just want my children to have the best.\u201d\nTwo years ago, The Hechinger Report and The Nation published an investigation of Gardendale\u2019s efforts to secede from Jefferson County to form a whiter, wealthier school district that excluded diverse neighborhoods like the one where Williams lived. Now, a new report from EdBuild, a nonprofit that advocates for equitable school funding, shows just how common school-secession efforts have become.\nBetween 2000 and 2016, 63 communities split off from their existing school districts to form new ones. In just the last two years, 10 more communities have followed. Most of the new districts are more affluent, and less racially diverse, than those they left behind. Another 16 communities are actively exploring efforts to form their own school districts, according to the report.\nThis form of educational gerrymandering has proven to be a winning strategy to concentrate property-tax dollars and hoard educational opportunities. And it leaves those districts that have been abandoned with fewer dollars to serve an even needier student body.\nRebecca Sibilia, EdBuild\u2019s CEO, cites a few reasons for the accelerating school-breakaway movement. In racially diverse parts of the country like Alabama, the desire of white parents to move their children into whiter, wealthier schools has been the driving factor, she said. But the report also documents similar efforts in virtually all-white parts of the country, where well-off districts flee larger, poorer ones.\nFor example, Maine is home to the majority of the 10 new school secessions. In that state, a 2007 law incentivized school districts to merge as a way to save money amid declining student enrollment. Originally, school districts would be hit with financial penalties if they didn\u2019t consolidate, but shortly after taking office in 2011, Republican Governor Paul LePage signed a bill repealing those penalties. Since then, Maine districts have been breaking away from larger districts, with eight communities seceding in just the last two years. On average, these new districts are wealthier than the ones they left. Elsewhere in the country, mega-rich communities have tried to secede from the merely wealthy, as is the case in Los Angeles County, California, where Malibu has proposed splitting from Santa Monica.\nSibilia says the school-secession movement illustrates the problems with the way US schools are funded. \u201cEven when there is not explicit racial intent, there is this hyperlocalism approach to education that is driving these secessions,\u201d she said. \u201cEither way it\u2019s emblematic of everything that is wrong with school funding and school borders in this country.\u201d\nNationwide, nearly half of education spending comes from local sources, mostly in the form of property taxes. Often, so-called \u201cgood\u201d school districts enjoy some of the highest property tax revenue-to-student ratios in the country. For instance, Newton, Massachusetts, which is home to roughly 90,000 residents and has 13,000 children enrolled in its public schools, collects more property tax revenue than Detroit, which enrolls far more students. Newton\u2019s schools are among the best-regarded in the country, whereas Detroit schools often struggle just to provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment.\nNewton isn\u2019t a breakaway district, but Sibilia says it\u2019s the kind of exclusive educational enclave that school secessionists seek to create. \u201cSchool funding is creating a caste system,\u201d she said. The ability to redraw school boundaries and cordon off property tax revenue, she said, \u201chas segregated kids, created inefficiencies and hoarded wealth.\u201d\nMeanwhile, some states are making it easier for communities to do just that. In total, 30 states have laws permitting towns and neighborhoods to form their own school districts, and in recent years, some have gone a few steps further. In December 2018, Indiana\u2019s State Board of Education released a memo reinterpreting existing laws to streamline the state\u2019s onerous school secession process. That same year, lawmakers in North Carolina passed a bill allowing four affluent suburban communities outside Charlotte to start charter schools that would be open only to their residents. Lawmakers also approved a bill giving municipalities the ability to restrict some of their property tax revenue to the schools in their city limits instead of spending it on the larger countywide school district that currently serves these communities. Taken together, these laws could result in the creation of four new, predominately white and affluent charter school districts operating outside the diverse Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district.\n\u201cParents aren\u2019t necessarily the bad guys here,\u201d said Sibilia. \u201cParents are going to want the best for their kids. The problem is state laws that don\u2019t ensure that all kids have access to the best.\u201d\nIndeed, there is little to stop most communities from seceding.\nLast year, a federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled that Gardendale could not form its own school district. The judges cited a lower court finding that the attempted split was racially motivated, which placed Gardendale in violation of a federal school desegregation order stemming from the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. (Leaders of the Gardendale secession movement deny that their proposal was racially motivated.) The desegregation order is still in place in that part of Alabama.\nIt was a big win, Sibilia acknowledges. But Gardendale is one of just a handful of communities still under the federal desegregation order.\nIn most of the country\u2014where no court order applies\u2014the secession movement continues unchecked.\nCorrection: This story has been updated to reflect a change made by EdBuild to its analysis of a secession effort in Malibu, California. That secession process is ongoing.",

(AP Photo / Vincent Yu)\nThis past Friday, a white nationalist murdered at least 50 people in a terrorist attack at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Minutes before he opened fire, the gunman posted a nearly 90-page manifesto full of Islamophobic and anti-immigrant sentiments.\nWhen asked after the shooting whether he sees a rise in white nationalism, Trump said he \u201cdidn\u2019t really\u201d think it was a big issue. But white nationalism and Islamophobia are grave and growing threats. This week\u2019s Take Action Nowshows you how to stand against hatred in your community.\nTake Action Now gives you three meaningful actions you can take each week whatever your schedule. You can sign up here to get these actions and more in your inbox every Tuesday.\nNO TIME TO SPARE?\nNew Zealand may be thousands of miles away, but you can still send help to those affected by this tragedy. Donate to one of several fundraisersset up to support victims and their families, or write a letter of support to the faith community at the Al-Noor mosque targeted by the shooter.\nGOT SOME TIME?\nIn times like these it\u2019s all the more important for allies to create strong relationships with vulnerable populations in their communities. If you are not Muslim yourself, this guidewill show you how to reach out to your Muslim neighbors with courtesy and respect, and you can use this template to plan and host an inter-faith dialogue dinner.\nREADY TO DIG IN?\nGiven Trump\u2019s implicit support for white nationalism, and the vacuum of leadership against hate in the federal government, we need to call on our local governments to affirm their support for Muslim communities. You can use this toolkitto push your city council or school board to pass a resolution condemning Islamophobia, or reach out to the Movement to End Racism and Islamophobia to plan an anti-bigotry seminar in your school or workplace.",

This is not &ldquo;A Budget for a Better America,&rdquo; as its title reads. It is a budget for a bitter betrayal.</p>\n<p>The first page of the president&rsquo;s budget message promises to &ldquo;protect future generations from Washington&rsquo;s habitual deficit spending.&rdquo; But tax cuts for the rich and corporations, not deficits, remain the president&rsquo;s priority. Even with its laughably rosy economic projections, the budget projects trillion-dollar annual deficits for the next four years, while doubling down on the president&rsquo;s tax-cut folly, calling for making them permanent.</p>\n<p>Yet the deficits do provide the excuse for across-the-board cuts in domestic programs. Here, too, working people, their families, individuals with disabilities, and the most vulnerable of the elderly take the biggest hits. The president, once more, <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/2020-trump-budget-a-disturbing-vision\">calls for</a> ending the Affordable Care Act, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/12/18260271/trump-medicaid-social-security-medicare-budget-cuts\">reversing</a> the expansion of Medicaid, and turning the latter into a block grant to states, capped at a level that does not keep up with rising costs.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/bbad3f17-7bc8-4cd2-95de-b353cb660b4b/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=770&height=433\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/4123dc24-a980-4322-a741-1017640965e1/759.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=361&width=642\"></img></figure>\n<p>Trump would also make college less affordable for tens of thousands, and continue to undermine public schools. The Education Department would suffer another 10 percent cut&mdash;the <a href=\"https://www.acenet.edu/news-room/Pages/White-House-Proposes-Significant-Cuts-to-Education-Programs-for-FY-2020.aspx\">third year in a row</a> of cuts. Trump would eliminate <a href=\"https://youthtoday.org/2019/03/trump-budget-would-kill-after-school-funding-leaving-providers-fearful/\">after-school programs for low-income students</a>. He would divert taxpayer money into <a href=\"https://www.au.org/church-state/march-2018-church-state/au-bulletin/trump-budget-proposes-1-billion-for-school\">vouchers or tax breaks for private schools</a>. And with student-loan debt now totaling a staggering $1.5 trillion&mdash;taken on largely by the sons and daughters of working families who can&rsquo;t afford soaring college costs&mdash;Trump would <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/03/12/white-house-wants-12-percent-cut-education-spending\">reduce</a> Pell Grant funding, cut work-study funding, end forbearance for those who work in public service for a decade after college, and eliminate subsidized Stafford loans.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, with a former coal-industry lobbyist in charge of the agency, Trump&rsquo;s biggest target is the Environmental Protection Agency, which would face cuts of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/politics/trump-budget-2020/?utm_term=.0f37c4910591#dept-17\">nearly one-third</a> in the next year alone. Such cuts would ensure that our air and water are more polluted, and more hazardous to our health.</p>\n<p>The working poor&mdash;the most vulnerable&mdash;would find their daily burdens far greater. Food stamps, which help lift more than <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/snap-lifts-millions-of-kids-out-of-poverty\">4 million kids</a> out of poverty, <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/2020-trump-budget-a-disturbing-vision\">would be slashed</a> by 30 percent over 10 years. Subsidies for public housing and rental vouchers would be <a href=\"https://www.curbed.com/2019/3/11/18260492/trump-2020-budget-proposal-cuts-hud-dot\">reduced</a>, leaving more people out in the cold, and home-energy assistance would be eliminated, leaving more inside in the cold.</p>\n<p>The Labor Department would take another hit, a cut of nearly 10 percent next year. The job corps that helps poor kids get started in the workforce will be slashed. Unemployment insurance would be cut, even though unemployment is likely to grow as the economy slows. And the workers who actually work for Trump&mdash;federal employees&mdash;receive <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/budget/2019/03/familiar-cuts-to-federal-retirement-health-benefits-are-back-in-trumps-proposed-2020-budget/\">another kick</a>, in reduced take-home pay and pension cuts.</p>\n<aside><figure><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cover0217.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-17-2020-issue/\">View our current issue</a></figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>Even some of the budget&rsquo;s increases mock those they pretend to help. The National Park Service, with a backlog of $12 billion in repairs for roads and facilities, <a href=\"https://unofficialnetworks.com/2019/03/15/trumps-budget-cuts-national-parks/\">gets a laughable $300 million</a>. The organization that enforces worker health and safety laws gets an additional $300,000 and supposedly <a href=\"https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/18145-osha-msha-slated-for-budget-increases-under-trump-administrations-fy-2020-budget-proposal\">another couple dozen inspectors</a>, but there are only enough inspectors to investigate companies about once every 145 years. The training program to educate workers in high-hazard industries about workplace safety would be <a href=\"https://www.nelp.org/publication/workplace-safety-enforcement-continues-decline-trump-administration/\">eliminated</a>. The administration would quiet the resulting fallout in part by eliminating the Obama-era requirement that large firms report on workplace illnesses.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s budget message <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/budget-fy2020.pdf\">argues</a> that &ldquo;we must write the next chapter of the great American adventure, turbocharging the industries of the future and establishing a new standard of living for the 21st century.&rdquo; Yet this budget would essentially concede &ldquo;the industries of the future&rdquo; to other countries. Our decrepit infrastructure needs literally trillions in additional funding. Trump claims he&rsquo;ll add <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-budget-asks-congress-for-200-billion-for-infrastructure-2019-03-11\">$200 billion</a> to invest in infrastructure over 10 years, but his budget cuts the Army Corps of Engineers by more than <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/ncsl-in-dc/publications-and-resources/president-s-2020-fy-budget-an-ncsl-summary.aspx\">22 percent</a>, the Transportation Department by <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/trump-budget-non-defense-discretionary-cuts-almost-twice-as-big-as-the-budget-says\">nearly 20 percent</a>, and the Interior Department by nearly 10 percent.</p>\n<p>Investment in research and development for the technologies, inventions, and innovations of the future is slashed. In its first year alone, Trump&rsquo;s budget would cut funding for the <a href=\"https://www.genomeweb.com/policy-legislation/white-house-proposes-12-percent-cut-nih-budget-fiscal-2020\">National Institutes of Health</a>, the <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/pharma-and-life-sciences/trumps-plan-to-cut-cdc-funding-likely-blocked-by-senate-panel\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/03/11/trump-budget-seeks-cuts-science-funding/\">National Science Foundation</a> between 12 and 14 percent each. He would <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/03/12/the-energy-202-trump-s-budget-seeks-cuts-to-climate-research-and-renewable-energy-programs/5c869eca1b326b2d177d604d/?utm_term=.5013710e59e5\">virtually eliminate</a> investment in research or development of renewable energy and energy efficiency. While subsidies for coal and fossil fuels are increased, those for renewable sources are rolled back.</p>\n<p>The end of his budget message includes a paragraph on &ldquo;Supporting Working Families,&rdquo; which calls on the United States to &ldquo;lead&rdquo; in helping families &ldquo;balance the competing demands of work and family.&rdquo; To address this, Trump calls for a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/11/trumps-2020-budget-proposal-promises-1-billion-childcare-investment.html\">one-time</a>&rdquo; investment of $1 billion in a fund aimed at &ldquo;stimulating employer investments in child care.&rdquo; This gesture doesn&rsquo;t come close to meeting millions of families&rsquo; childcare needs, which exceed the cost of college tuition in some 28 states.

                "text": "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Each week we cross-post an excerpt from Katrina vanden Heuvel\u2019s column at the WashingtonPost.com. Read the full text of Katrina\u2019s column here.\nOn its release last week, President Trump\u2019s $4.7 trillion 2020 budget was pronounced dead on arrival, and was quickly lost in the cacophony of his presidency. The New York Times suggested it provides a \u201cdeclaration of Mr. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign priorities.\u201d In fact, its pages include not only the president\u2019s campaign rhetoric but also an accounting of his actual values and priorities that reveal the scope of his betrayal of the working men and women who voted him into office. This is not \u201cA Budget for a Better America,\u201d as its title reads. It is a budget for a bitter betrayal.\nThe first page of the president\u2019s budget message promises to \u201cprotect future generations from Washington\u2019s habitual deficit spending.\u201d But tax cuts for the rich and corporations, not deficits, remain the president\u2019s priority. Even with its laughably rosy economic projections, the budget projects trillion-dollar annual deficits for the next four years, while doubling down on the president\u2019s tax-cut folly, calling for making them permanent.\nYet the deficits do provide the excuse for across-the-board cuts in domestic programs. Here, too, working people, their families, individuals with disabilities, and the most vulnerable of the elderly take the biggest hits. The president, once more, calls for ending the Affordable Care Act, reversing the expansion of Medicaid, and turning the latter into a block grant to states, capped at a level that does not keep up with rising costs.\nTrump would also make college less affordable for tens of thousands, and continue to undermine public schools. The Education Department would suffer another 10 percent cut\u2014the third year in a row of cuts. Trump would eliminate after-school programs for low-income students. He would divert taxpayer money into vouchers or tax breaks for private schools. And with student-loan debt now totaling a staggering $1.5 trillion\u2014taken on largely by the sons and daughters of working families who can\u2019t afford soaring college costs\u2014Trump would reduce Pell Grant funding, cut work-study funding, end forbearance for those who work in public service for a decade after college, and eliminate subsidized Stafford loans.\nNot surprisingly, with a former coal-industry lobbyist in charge of the agency, Trump\u2019s biggest target is the Environmental Protection Agency, which would face cuts of nearly one-third in the next year alone. Such cuts would ensure that our air and water are more polluted, and more hazardous to our health.\nThe working poor\u2014the most vulnerable\u2014would find their daily burdens far greater. Food stamps, which help lift more than 4 million kids out of poverty, would be slashed by 30 percent over 10 years. Subsidies for public housing and rental vouchers would be reduced, leaving more people out in the cold, and home-energy assistance would be eliminated, leaving more inside in the cold.\nThe Labor Department would take another hit, a cut of nearly 10 percent next year. The job corps that helps poor kids get started in the workforce will be slashed. Unemployment insurance would be cut, even though unemployment is likely to grow as the economy slows. And the workers who actually work for Trump\u2014federal employees\u2014receive another kick, in reduced take-home pay and pension cuts.\nEven some of the budget\u2019s increases mock those they pretend to help. The National Park Service, with a backlog of $12 billion in repairs for roads and facilities, gets a laughable $300 million. The organization that enforces worker health and safety laws gets an additional $300,000 and supposedly another couple dozen inspectors, but there are only enough inspectors to investigate companies about once every 145 years. The training program to educate workers in high-hazard industries about workplace safety would be eliminated. The administration would quiet the resulting fallout in part by eliminating the Obama-era requirement that large firms report on workplace illnesses.\nTrump\u2019s budget message argues that \u201cwe must write the next chapter of the great American adventure, turbocharging the industries of the future and establishing a new standard of living for the 21st century.\u201d Yet this budget would essentially concede \u201cthe industries of the future\u201d to other countries. Our decrepit infrastructure needs literally trillions in additional funding. Trump claims he\u2019ll add $200 billion to invest in infrastructure over 10 years, but his budget cuts the Army Corps of Engineers by more than 22 percent, the Transportation Department by nearly 20 percent, and the Interior Department by nearly 10 percent.\nInvestment in research and development for the technologies, inventions, and innovations of the future is slashed. In its first year alone, Trump\u2019s budget would cut funding for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Science Foundation between 12 and 14 percent each. He would virtually eliminate investment in research or development of renewable energy and energy efficiency. While subsidies for coal and fossil fuels are increased, those for renewable sources are rolled back.\nThe end of his budget message includes a paragraph on \u201cSupporting Working Families,\u201d which calls on the United States to \u201clead\u201d in helping families \u201cbalance the competing demands of work and family.\u201d To address this, Trump calls for a \u201cone-time\u201d investment of $1 billion in a fund aimed at \u201cstimulating employer investments in child care.\u201d This gesture doesn\u2019t come close to meeting millions of families\u2019 childcare needs, which exceed the cost of college tuition in some 28 states. The administration also claims it \u201chas pledged to provide paid parental leave\u201d to help working parents,\u201d but there is neither a plan nor an appropriation to pay for it.\nTrump\u2019s budget statement repeats his standard pledge that his administration is \u201cabsolutely committed to putting the needs of the American worker first.\u201d His budget\u2019s numbers, however, mock his words. He continues to posture as the champion of working people, even as inequality gets worse, the public investments vital to our future are starved, the rich make off with the tax cuts, and working people get the shaft. The only question is how long he can get away with this con.",
