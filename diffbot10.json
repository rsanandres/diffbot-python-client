And that may be in part because the agency and most of its former senior officials have avoided public criticism of Trump for fear of incurring his wrath and jeopardizing Haspel&rsquo;s job as well as the institution, according to former agency officials. Indeed, the CIA is one of the few major government departments that has not been subjected to a Trump political appointee at its senior levels.</p>\n<h2>Trump&rsquo;s Nigerian Ban Is About Race, Not Security</h2>\n<h3>Nigerian entrepreneurship and creativity have always found a home in the United States&mdash;until now.</h3>\n<figure><iframe data-adtag=\"//distroscale-d.openx.net/v/1.0/av?auid=538587333&url=https%3A%2F%2Fforeignpolicy.com%2F2019%2F02%2F21%2Fcia-lies-low-waiting-for-trump-storm-to-pass%2F&cb=777916&vwd=643&vht=362&gdpr=0&gdpr_consent=&schain=1.0,1!distroscale.com,5846021724,1\" data-friendly=\"false\" data-sdktype=\"ima_html5\" src=\"https://c5x8i7c7.ssl.hwcdn.net/vplayer-parallel/20190312_1329/ima_html5/index.html\"></iframe></figure>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://c5x8i7c7.ssl.hwcdn.net/vplayer-parallel/20190405_1722/videojs/show.html?controls=1&loop=30&autoplay=0&tracker=c59e50bb-8cb4-4f69-8cd4-b8cb91173596&height=362&width=643&vurl=%2F%2Fdstroscal1.s.llnwi.net%2Fpublic%2Fvideos%2Fdgv%2F20200205051527_5e3a4bed2f5e4%2Fdgv_foreignpolicy_20200205051527_new.mp4&poster=%2F%2Fdstroscal1.s.llnwi.net%2Fpublic%2Fvideos%2Fdgv%2F20200205051527_5e3a4bed2f5e4%2Fdgv_foreignpolicy_20200205051527_new.jpg\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Many career intelligence professionals are privately shocked and appalled by Trump&rsquo;s behavior, in particular his tendency to credit the statements of bad actors such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the assessments of the CIA. But with a few exceptions such as former CIA Director John Brennan, most of these career officials have remained silent, knowing that Trump typically focuses his ire on public agencies he considers disloyal.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;One of reasons why a number of former officials I&rsquo;ve talked to have been a little reluctant to be vocally critical is that it will make her [Haspel&rsquo;s] job harder,&rdquo; one former senior CIA official said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re concerned he [Trump] will take it out on them and send over a Fox News analyst as the next DNI.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The former official added: &ldquo;The one thing I&rsquo;ve been pleasantly surprised at is that so far the intelligence community seems to be immune from getting their senior positions filled by political appointees. Gina&rsquo;s been remarkably successful at filling all senior positions with career professionals.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>According to former CIA Director Michael Hayden, a onetime Trump critic who has been recovering from a stroke, &ldquo;I think Gina is just trying to get out of the way and weather it. Trying to lie low maybe.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hayden and others pointed out that in recent congressional testimony, Haspel gave answers similar to those of Coats, whose rejection of White House assertions about North Korea, Iran, and the Islamic State was said to have incensed the president and caused him to question Coats&rsquo;s loyalty. Afterward, Trump confidant Christopher Ruddy, publisher of the conservative <em>Newsmax</em> magazine, suggested the president was seeking to fire Coats. The <em>Washington Post</em> quoted a Trump &ldquo;advisor&rdquo; as saying the president was &ldquo;enraged&rdquo; and complaining that Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana, was &ldquo;not on the team.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Haspel has not been apparently targeted by the president. Last year, she also risked angering the president when she testified that the CIA believed Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the death of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, again contradicting Trump, who has said &ldquo;we may never know&rdquo; if the crown prince was guilty. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a smoking gun. There&rsquo;s a smoking saw,&rdquo; Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters after he heard Haspel&rsquo;s account.</p>\n<p>Career intelligence officials say they have been stunned by the outspokenness of Brennan, a frequent and fierce critic of Trump who lost his security clearance last August on orders from the president.</p>\n<p>But the officials note that Brennan&rsquo;s statements have been the exception rather than the rule, although former DNI James Clapper has also been vocal in criticizing the president. In a spate of tweets and remarks on television, Brennan&mdash;who was known as taciturn during his professional career&mdash;has called Trump &ldquo;drunk on power&rdquo; and unfit for office.</p>\n<p>And after Trump erupted following Coats&rsquo;s and Haspel&rsquo;s testimony in late January&mdash;when they <a href=\"http://time.com/5515473/trump-coats-senate/\">contradicted Trump</a> by assessing that North Korea did not intend to surrender its nuclear weapons, that Iran was complying with its anti-nuclear commitments, and the Islamic State was still dangerous&mdash;Brennan blasted the president again. &ldquo;Your refusal to accept the unanimous assessment of U.S. Intelligence on Iran, No. Korea, ISIS, Russia, &amp; so much more shows the extent of your intellectual bankruptcy,&rdquo; Brennan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnBrennan/status/1090627443340308480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1090627443340308480&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fpolicy%2Fnational-security%2F427630-brennan-rips-into-trump-for-criticizing-intel-chiefs-it-shows-the\">tweeted</a>. &ldquo;All Americans, especially members of Congress, need to understand the danger you pose to our national security.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Opinions about Trump within the intelligence community are hardly uniform. Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former CIA case officer who is now aligned with the right-leaning Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said that Brennan had been &ldquo;strongly disliked&rdquo; within the agency during his time as director, especially by the directorate of operations, of which he was never a part. Gerecht also said that, at least at the beginning of the Trump administration, the new president and his worldview were not a problem for many in the DO, which &ldquo;has a big strain of realism running through its veins&rdquo; and exhibits &ldquo;a certain earthy courseness.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But &ldquo;bureaucratically no organization likes to be discounted,&rdquo; Gerecht added. &ldquo;The agency likes to pride itself on its presidential access and clout. So Trump is denying it is pride of place. That is never liked, never appreciated.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Still, he said, it&rsquo;s just as likely that many former CIA officials are remaining quiet for selfish reasons. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that many retired officers care about Gina Haspel. I think it&rsquo;s that many of them are still on the gravy train. Contracting is a huge business now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The intelligence community, which includes many retired officials with security clearances, has not been completely silent. After Brennan&rsquo;s clearance was revoked, 177 former national security officials, including many with the CIA, released a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wb1OWfYIL-FRIpLkU4uwYI1shL6HNnbD/view\">statement</a> protesting the move. But they noted that their signatures &ldquo;do not necessarily mean that we concur with the opinions expressed by former CIA Director Brennan or the way in which he expressed them.&rdquo; Few of those officials have been heard from since.</p>\n<p>Most of the former CIA officials interviewed for this article lived through the difficult run-up to the Iraq War, when the agency fell under severe pressure from the White House to tie al Qaeda to Iraq and trump up evidence of weapons of mass destruction. They acknowledge that, as the former CIA official said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not unusual for the intelligence community to find that its views are not embraced entirely by a sitting administration.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gerecht added that over the course of its history the agency&rsquo;s threat assessments often have been &ldquo;astoundingly inaccurate,&rdquo; and presidents are right to question them.</p>\n<p>But the career officials say Trump&rsquo;s direct assault on their professionalism is without precedent. Some have insisted the agency will remain relevant in spite of a loss of morale, particularly since the Trump administration has increased the budget for its operations. According to Mary McCarthy, who worked as a CIA analyst and official in the inspector general&rsquo;s office for more than two decades, the agency&rsquo;s likely response will be to try to give Trump some of what he wants on smaller issues while holding firm to their assessments on major issues such as North Korea and Iran.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to produce intelligence that is going to poke him in the eye, so you pull your punches. On the humint [human intelligence] collection side, it&rsquo;s the same thing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For example, hypothetically there might be source that gives them some disparaging information on a leader he doesn&rsquo;t like. Maybe it&rsquo;s a report that Angela Merkel strangles puppies. So you get out little things like that at the edges. But for big things like North Korea, I don&rsquo;t see them pulling punches.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Even so, for a nation whose credibility was already badly damaged by the Iraq debacle and whose international rivals, such as Putin, are happily trumpeting Trump&rsquo;s dismissal of U.S. intelligence, it remains a serious question whether the CIA&rsquo;s reputation can long survive, much less Haspel herself. &ldquo;If this goes on four more years, it will be really catastrophic,&rdquo; Hayden said.</p>\n<p>The CIA did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>",

                "text": "For most of his presidency, Donald Trump has waged a war on members of his own intelligence community, openly scorning their assessments and now reportedly weighing whether to fire Dan Coats as director of national intelligence for publicly opposing his views.\nBut current CIA Director Gina Haspel, despite her own quiet repudiation of the president\u2019s rhetoric, appears to be safe in her post. And that may be in part because the agency and most of its former senior officials have avoided public criticism of Trump for fear of incurring his wrath and jeopardizing Haspel\u2019s job as well as the institution, according to former agency officials. Indeed, the CIA is one of the few major government departments that has not been subjected to a Trump political appointee at its senior levels.\nTrump\u2019s Nigerian Ban Is About Race, Not Security\nNigerian entrepreneurship and creativity have always found a home in the United States\u2014until now.\nMany career intelligence professionals are privately shocked and appalled by Trump\u2019s behavior, in particular his tendency to credit the statements of bad actors such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the assessments of the CIA. But with a few exceptions such as former CIA Director John Brennan, most of these career officials have remained silent, knowing that Trump typically focuses his ire on public agencies he considers disloyal.\n\u201cOne of reasons why a number of former officials I\u2019ve talked to have been a little reluctant to be vocally critical is that it will make her [Haspel\u2019s] job harder,\u201d one former senior CIA official said. \u201cThey\u2019re concerned he [Trump] will take it out on them and send over a Fox News analyst as the next DNI.\u201d\nThe former official added: \u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised at is that so far the intelligence community seems to be immune from getting their senior positions filled by political appointees. Gina\u2019s been remarkably successful at filling all senior positions with career professionals.\u201d\nAccording to former CIA Director Michael Hayden, a onetime Trump critic who has been recovering from a stroke, \u201cI think Gina is just trying to get out of the way and weather it. Trying to lie low maybe.\u201d\nHayden and others pointed out that in recent congressional testimony, Haspel gave answers similar to those of Coats, whose rejection of White House assertions about North Korea, Iran, and the Islamic State was said to have incensed the president and caused him to question Coats\u2019s loyalty. Afterward, Trump confidant Christopher Ruddy, publisher of the conservative Newsmax magazine, suggested the president was seeking to fire Coats. The Washington Post quoted a Trump \u201cadvisor\u201d as saying the president was \u201cenraged\u201d and complaining that Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana, was \u201cnot on the team.\u201d\nBut Haspel has not been apparently targeted by the president. Last year, she also risked angering the president when she testified that the CIA believed Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the death of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, again contradicting Trump, who has said \u201cwe may never know\u201d if the crown prince was guilty. \u201cThere\u2019s not a smoking gun. There\u2019s a smoking saw,\u201d Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters after he heard Haspel\u2019s account.\nCareer intelligence officials say they have been stunned by the outspokenness of Brennan, a frequent and fierce critic of Trump who lost his security clearance last August on orders from the president.\nBut the officials note that Brennan\u2019s statements have been the exception rather than the rule, although former DNI James Clapper has also been vocal in criticizing the president. In a spate of tweets and remarks on television, Brennan\u2014who was known as taciturn during his professional career\u2014has called Trump \u201cdrunk on power\u201d and unfit for office.\nAnd after Trump erupted following Coats\u2019s and Haspel\u2019s testimony in late January\u2014when they contradicted Trump by assessing that North Korea did not intend to surrender its nuclear weapons, that Iran was complying with its anti-nuclear commitments, and the Islamic State was still dangerous\u2014Brennan blasted the president again. \u201cYour refusal to accept the unanimous assessment of U.S. Intelligence on Iran, No. Korea, ISIS, Russia, & so much more shows the extent of your intellectual bankruptcy,\u201d Brennan tweeted. \u201cAll Americans, especially members of Congress, need to understand the danger you pose to our national security.\u201d\nOpinions about Trump within the intelligence community are hardly uniform. Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former CIA case officer who is now aligned with the right-leaning Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said that Brennan had been \u201cstrongly disliked\u201d within the agency during his time as director, especially by the directorate of operations, of which he was never a part. Gerecht also said that, at least at the beginning of the Trump administration, the new president and his worldview were not a problem for many in the DO, which \u201chas a big strain of realism running through its veins\u201d and exhibits \u201ca certain earthy courseness.\u201d\nBut \u201cbureaucratically no organization likes to be discounted,\u201d Gerecht added. \u201cThe agency likes to pride itself on its presidential access and clout. So Trump is denying it is pride of place. That is never liked, never appreciated.\u201d\nStill, he said, it\u2019s just as likely that many former CIA officials are remaining quiet for selfish reasons. \u201cI don\u2019t think that many retired officers care about Gina Haspel. I think it\u2019s that many of them are still on the gravy train. Contracting is a huge business now.\u201d\nThe intelligence community, which includes many retired officials with security clearances, has not been completely silent. After Brennan\u2019s clearance was revoked, 177 former national security officials, including many with the CIA, released a statement protesting the move. But they noted that their signatures \u201cdo not necessarily mean that we concur with the opinions expressed by former CIA Director Brennan or the way in which he expressed them.\u201d Few of those officials have been heard from since.\nMost of the former CIA officials interviewed for this article lived through the difficult run-up to the Iraq War, when the agency fell under severe pressure from the White House to tie al Qaeda to Iraq and trump up evidence of weapons of mass destruction. They acknowledge that, as the former CIA official said, \u201cit\u2019s not unusual for the intelligence community to find that its views are not embraced entirely by a sitting administration.\u201d\nGerecht added that over the course of its history the agency\u2019s threat assessments often have been \u201castoundingly inaccurate,\u201d and presidents are right to question them.\nBut the career officials say Trump\u2019s direct assault on their professionalism is without precedent. Some have insisted the agency will remain relevant in spite of a loss of morale, particularly since the Trump administration has increased the budget for its operations. According to Mary McCarthy, who worked as a CIA analyst and official in the inspector general\u2019s office for more than two decades, the agency\u2019s likely response will be to try to give Trump some of what he wants on smaller issues while holding firm to their assessments on major issues such as North Korea and Iran.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to produce intelligence that is going to poke him in the eye, so you pull your punches. On the humint [human intelligence] collection side, it\u2019s the same thing,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, hypothetically there might be source that gives them some disparaging information on a leader he doesn\u2019t like. Maybe it\u2019s a report that Angela Merkel strangles puppies. So you get out little things like that at the edges. But for big things like North Korea, I don\u2019t see them pulling punches.\u201d\nEven so, for a nation whose credibility was already badly damaged by the Iraq debacle and whose international rivals, such as Putin, are happily trumpeting Trump\u2019s dismissal of U.S. intelligence, it remains a serious question whether the CIA\u2019s reputation can long survive, much less Haspel herself. \u201cIf this goes on four more years, it will be really catastrophic,\u201d Hayden said.\nThe CIA did not immediately return a request for comment.",

The two leaders agreed to continue coordinating the creation of a potential safe zone on Turkey&rsquo;s border with Syria, according to the White House. It&rsquo;s the second time in recent months that a major decision on Syria followed a phone call between Trump and Erdogan.</p>\n<p>During a meeting with Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar at the Pentagon on Friday afternoon, Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan said the mission in Syria remains unchanged: the defeat of the Islamic State. The U.S. troops that remain in the country will be focused on &ldquo;stabilization and enhancing the &ldquo;security capability of local security forces,&rdquo; he noted.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We will do that as strategic partners,&rdquo; Shanahan said.</p>\n<p>Maintaining a presence in Syria, particularly at Tanf, which straddles a potential Iranian supply route through Iraq to Syria, has been a goal of Bolton&rsquo;s for months. During a January trip to the region aimed at reassuring allies that the United States was not backing down from its strategy to counter Iranian aggression, Bolton <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/some-u-s-troops-could-remain-syria-after-planned-withdrawal-n955046\">reportedly</a> discussed with Israeli officials the plan to leave forces at the base as a way to diminish Tehran&rsquo;s influence in the region.</p>\n<p>Tanf was originally a U.S. outpost to train local Syrian fighters. But as the Islamic State has steadily crumbled, Tanf has become a crucial buttress against Iranian influence. Officials in 2017 established an &ldquo;exclusion zone&rdquo; about 34 miles around the garrison, which allows U.S. troops to claim self-defense in striking Iranian or other forces moving through that area.</p>\n<p>But a continued U.S. presence at Tanf, which is far from the fight against the Islamic State in northeastern Syria, poses major risks. An incident at the garrison in 2017 involving the transport of an Iranian port-a-potty nearly led to a <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/04/how-u-s-mission-creep-in-syria-and-iraq-could-trigger-war-with-iran/\">confrontation</a> between U.S. and Iranian forces, illustrating just how quickly even minor events could escalate on the complex battlefield there.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, leaving small forces in both Syria and Iraq to &ldquo;watch Iran&rdquo; rather than fight the Islamic State raises legal questions. U.S. troops are able to fight nonstate militants, such as the Islamic State or al Qaeda, under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), a response to 9/11. But U.S. military forces are not authorized to target state actors&mdash;such as Iranian, Russian, Syrian, or proxy regime forces in Syria&mdash;unless they are attacked and are responding in self-defense.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Congress hasn&rsquo;t authorized an anti-Iran mission in Syria. The truth is the legal basis for the U.S. military presence in Syria, the 2001 AUMF, is pretty shaky and needs to be revisited,&rdquo; an aide for Sen. Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/04/how-u-s-mission-creep-in-syria-and-iraq-could-trigger-war-with-iran/\">told</a> FP in early February. &ldquo;Any move by the Trump administration to expand that authorization even more to include operations against Iran will definitely draw a response from Congress.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Still, the decision to maintain troops in northeastern Syria is a win for Syrian Kurds, who have been a key U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State. The move may be in part directed at bolstering other U.S. allies in the region, particularly the British and the French, who are reportedly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/allies-say-they-wont-remain-in-syria-after-us-troops-withdraw/2019/02/20/62e503b2-3532-11e9-a400-e481bf264fdc_story.html\">hesitant</a> to remain in Syria after U.S. troops depart.</p>\n<p>But European defense officials have rebuffed the idea that they are looking for a quick exit. During a meeting at the Pentagon on Thursday, Shanahan and Belgian Defense Minister Didier Reynders flatly denied that European allies had rejected the U.S. request to stay in Syria.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Reynders said of discussions at the Munich Security Conference about the situation in Syria. &ldquo;It was a very open discussion in Munich about that&mdash;but without the refusal from all different countries like you said.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>However, he noted that he would insist on one condition for a continued European presence&mdash;a legal mandate to remain on the ground in Syria. It is unclear where that mandate would come from.</p>",

                "text": "John Bolton, the U.S. national security advisor and longtime Iran hawk, has won a crucial victory with the partial reversal of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria.\nIn an apparent softening of Trump\u2019s abrupt announcement last December that the United States would pull out completely from Syria\u2014a move that blindsided U.S. allies and prompted the resignation of his defense secretary, James Mattis\u2014the administration now concedes that a small force of roughly 400 troops will remain in the country.\nTrump\u2019s Nigerian Ban Is About Race, Not Security\nThat number includes a \u201cpeace keeping group\u201d of about 200 troops in northeastern Syria, where the U.S.- and coalition-backed Syrian Democratic Forces are still fighting the remnants of the Islamic State, and another 200 stationed at the al Tanf garrison, a remote base in southeastern Syria near the border with Jordan, according to a senior administration official.\nThe decision, which was initially announced in a late Feb. 21 statement from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, came just hours after a phone call between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The two leaders agreed to continue coordinating the creation of a potential safe zone on Turkey\u2019s border with Syria, according to the White House. It\u2019s the second time in recent months that a major decision on Syria followed a phone call between Trump and Erdogan.\nDuring a meeting with Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar at the Pentagon on Friday afternoon, Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan said the mission in Syria remains unchanged: the defeat of the Islamic State. The U.S. troops that remain in the country will be focused on \u201cstabilization and enhancing the \u201csecurity capability of local security forces,\u201d he noted.\n\u201cWe will do that as strategic partners,\u201d Shanahan said.\nMaintaining a presence in Syria, particularly at Tanf, which straddles a potential Iranian supply route through Iraq to Syria, has been a goal of Bolton\u2019s for months. During a January trip to the region aimed at reassuring allies that the United States was not backing down from its strategy to counter Iranian aggression, Bolton reportedly discussed with Israeli officials the plan to leave forces at the base as a way to diminish Tehran\u2019s influence in the region.\nTanf was originally a U.S. outpost to train local Syrian fighters. But as the Islamic State has steadily crumbled, Tanf has become a crucial buttress against Iranian influence. Officials in 2017 established an \u201cexclusion zone\u201d about 34 miles around the garrison, which allows U.S. troops to claim self-defense in striking Iranian or other forces moving through that area.\nBut a continued U.S. presence at Tanf, which is far from the fight against the Islamic State in northeastern Syria, poses major risks. An incident at the garrison in 2017 involving the transport of an Iranian port-a-potty nearly led to a confrontation between U.S. and Iranian forces, illustrating just how quickly even minor events could escalate on the complex battlefield there.\nFurthermore, leaving small forces in both Syria and Iraq to \u201cwatch Iran\u201d rather than fight the Islamic State raises legal questions. U.S. troops are able to fight nonstate militants, such as the Islamic State or al Qaeda, under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), a response to 9/11. But U.S. military forces are not authorized to target state actors\u2014such as Iranian, Russian, Syrian, or proxy regime forces in Syria\u2014unless they are attacked and are responding in self-defense.\n\u201cCongress hasn\u2019t authorized an anti-Iran mission in Syria. The truth is the legal basis for the U.S. military presence in Syria, the 2001 AUMF, is pretty shaky and needs to be revisited,\u201d an aide for Sen. Bernie Sanders told FP in early February. \u201cAny move by the Trump administration to expand that authorization even more to include operations against Iran will definitely draw a response from Congress.\u201d\nStill, the decision to maintain troops in northeastern Syria is a win for Syrian Kurds, who have been a key U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State. The move may be in part directed at bolstering other U.S. allies in the region, particularly the British and the French, who are reportedly hesitant to remain in Syria after U.S. troops depart.\nBut European defense officials have rebuffed the idea that they are looking for a quick exit. During a meeting at the Pentagon on Thursday, Shanahan and Belgian Defense Minister Didier Reynders flatly denied that European allies had rejected the U.S. request to stay in Syria.\n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Reynders said of discussions at the Munich Security Conference about the situation in Syria. \u201cIt was a very open discussion in Munich about that\u2014but without the refusal from all different countries like you said.\u201d\nHowever, he noted that he would insist on one condition for a continued European presence\u2014a legal mandate to remain on the ground in Syria. It is unclear where that mandate would come from.",

The whistleblowers, who were not identified, also warned &ldquo;of conflicts of interest among top White House advisers that could implicate federal criminal statutes,&rdquo; the report said.</p>\n<p>And in the wake of the gruesome, regime-ordered killing in October 2018 of the <i>Washington Post </i>columnist Jamal Khashoggi, anti-Saudi sentiment in Washington that had already been rising due to atrocities in Yemen is boiling over. Lawmakers such as Republican Sen. Marco Rubio have introduced legislation that would, unusually, give Congress the final say on whether to allow nuclear technology exports to Saudi Arabia, adding extra restrictions to the standard accord with the express intent of <a href=\"https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=AB9F62A2-4391-407A-BF61-611D94ACA502\">thwarting</a> Riyadh&rsquo;s quest for a nuclear bomb.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If a government is willing to murder a U.S. green-card holder,&rdquo; Rubio <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/marco-rubio-warns-trump-on-saudi-nuclear-deal-talk-no-relationship-is-too-big-to-fail\">told</a> the <i>Daily Beast</i>, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a legitimate question over whether such a government could be trusted with nuclear energy and the potential weaponization of it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Saudi Arabia certainly needs more power. With electricity demand <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/saudi-arabia-s-vision-2030-key-electric-power-decisions-ahead\">growing</a> by as much as 8 percent a year&mdash;needed to run air conditioners, desalination plants, and more&mdash;the country is looking to find something other than oil and gas, which currently provide nearly all its electricity, to keep the lights on.</p>\n<p>Officials in Saudi Arabia, which can burn as much as one-tenth of its oil production every summer just making electricity, want to preserve that black gold for more lucrative exports. One answer is adding more renewable energy, especially solar power. Another answer is nuclear power, and the country plans to build as many as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/why-oil-rich-saudi-arabia-is-turning-to-nuclear-power-quicktake\">16 big nuclear power plants</a> over the next 25 years; Riyadh already has a tender out for the first two plants, attracting the interest of Russia, China, France, South Korea&mdash;and, especially, the United States.</p>\n<p>America&rsquo;s nuclear industry, seeing almost zero chance of big new projects at home, is <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/mas/ian/build/groups/public/@tg_ian/@nuclear/documents/webcontent/tg_ian_005532.pdf\">champing at the bit</a> to get into what could be a $100 billion market. One industry executive has called the Saudi foray into nuclear power the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/mas/ian/build/groups/public/@tg_ian/@nuclear/documents/webcontent/tg_ian_005575.pdf\">deal of the decade</a>,&rdquo; and U.S. officials (and Saudi lobbyists) have been <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/mas/ian/build/groups/public/@tg_ian/@nuclear/documents/webcontent/tg_ian_005554.pdf\">pressing</a> the Trump administration to make it <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/mas/ian/build/groups/public/@tg_ian/@nuclear/documents/webcontent/tg_ian_005569.pdf\">easier</a> for U.S. nuclear firms to do business in Saudi Arabia. Top nuclear executives <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-12/trump-said-to-meet-with-nuclear-developers-looking-globally\">met</a> with President Donald Trump at the White House this month to discuss Saudi Arabia, among other topics.</p>\n<p>Trump administration officials argue that America&rsquo;s nuclear industry should sell reactors to Saudi Arabia&mdash;or else Russia or China will, potentially giving Moscow or Beijing a decades-long lucrative, strategic partnership with a keystone state in the Middle East. (On Friday, Saudi Arabia took another big step toward deepening its already tight energy relationship with China, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/asia-saudi-china/update-1-saudi-agrees-10-bln-china-refinery-deal-as-crown-prince-visits-idUSL3N20H37C\">inking</a> a $10 billion deal to build a new refinery.)</p>\n<p>In general, selling U.S. nuclear technology has another benefit, too, many experts <a href=\"https://twq.elliott.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2121/f/downloads/TWQ_Summer2018_HolgateSaha.pdf\">say</a>: The United States also exports its regulatory regime, safety and security standards, and strict protocols against nuclear proliferation, making American participation in the worldwide scramble for nuclear power a way to boost, rather than undermine, global security.</p>\n<p>But in order to sell reactors overseas, the United States needs a formal agreement with the other country regulating just how those nuclear technologies will be used; to date, the United States has nearly 50 such agreements, known as &ldquo;123 agreements&rdquo; for the eponymous section of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act. For several years, Washington and Saudi Arabia have been negotiating their own 123 accord. But lately, those <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-12/news/pressure-builds-saudi-nuclear-accord\">efforts</a> have run into a buzz saw&mdash;or rather, a Saudi bone saw.</p>\n<p>Many experts argue that fears that Saudi Arabia will turn nuclear reactors into breeders for a weapons program are overblown. Reactors use low-enriched uranium, while bombs need highly enriched uranium. And that kind of enrichment program is hard to keep hidden, not to mention costly. Reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to scrape out plutonium to build a bomb is even costlier.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There seems to be a conflating of legitimate national security issues with civilian nuclear technology. Saudi Arabia is not Iran. It&rsquo;s not North Korea,&rdquo; said Katie Tubb, a nuclear energy specialist at the Heritage Foundation.

Civilian nuclear technology can be safeguarded, and it&rsquo;s not very well suited to producing nuclear weapons material,&rdquo; said Jon Wolfsthal, formerly a top nonproliferation official in President Barack Obama&rsquo;s administration and now director of the Nuclear Crisis Group.</p>\n<p>Except for one thing, Wolfsthal added: &ldquo;Saudi Arabia doesn&rsquo;t just want reactors&mdash;it wants the ability to enrich uranium. And that is very sensitive technology.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>All states that have signed on to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), as Saudi Arabia has, theoretically have the right to enrich uranium. Insisting on that right, Saudi Arabia has refused to forswear uranium enrichment as part of any agreement with the United States. That stands in sharp contrast to the UAE, which inked a novel 123 agreement in 2009 that included an explicit ban on any enrichment activities as a safeguard against proliferation. But Saudi Arabia has refused to consider signing on to that so-called &ldquo;gold standard.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The unwillingness to sign up to the &lsquo;gold standard&rsquo; gives people pause,&rdquo; Wolfsthal said.</p>\n<p>Holding onto a sovereign right to enrichment is one thing. A much bigger problem is that, the NPT notwithstanding, Saudi officials have openly said they&rsquo;d build a nuclear bomb of their own if Iran builds one.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible,&rdquo; Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/mbs-saudis-pursue-nuclear-weapons-iran-180315152433732.html\">said</a> last year.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the main reason that Riyadh&rsquo;s quest for nuclear power plants causes unease in a way that didn&rsquo;t happen with other countries that have turned to atomic energy.

                "text": "The release this week of an explosive report by House Democrats alleging that the Trump administration has sought to help its cronies sell nuclear power technology to Saudi Arabia has dramatically heightened tensions between the White House and lawmakers in both chambers.\nBut sleaze aside, is there cause for alarm over Saudi Arabia gaining access to the same kind of power-generating technology that more than 30 countries around the world already use?\nTrump\u2019s Nigerian Ban Is About Race, Not Security\nNigerian entrepreneurship and creativity have always found a home in the United States\u2014until now.\nBoth Republican and Democratic legislators and nuclear experts who are increasingly alarmed at Saudi Arabia\u2019s reckless behavior say there is plenty of reason to be concerned.\nAccording to the House report, whistleblowers \u201chave warned about political appointees ignoring directives from top ethics advisors at the White House who repeatedly and unsuccessfully ordered senior Trump Administration officials to halt their efforts\u201d to sell nuclear know-how to Riyadh. The whistleblowers, who were not identified, also warned \u201cof conflicts of interest among top White House advisers that could implicate federal criminal statutes,\u201d the report said.\nAnd in the wake of the gruesome, regime-ordered killing in October 2018 of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, anti-Saudi sentiment in Washington that had already been rising due to atrocities in Yemen is boiling over. Lawmakers such as Republican Sen. Marco Rubio have introduced legislation that would, unusually, give Congress the final say on whether to allow nuclear technology exports to Saudi Arabia, adding extra restrictions to the standard accord with the express intent of thwarting Riyadh\u2019s quest for a nuclear bomb.\n\u201cIf a government is willing to murder a U.S. green-card holder,\u201d Rubio told the Daily Beast, \u201cthere\u2019s a legitimate question over whether such a government could be trusted with nuclear energy and the potential weaponization of it.\u201d\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia certainly needs more power. With electricity demand growing by as much as 8 percent a year\u2014needed to run air conditioners, desalination plants, and more\u2014the country is looking to find something other than oil and gas, which currently provide nearly all its electricity, to keep the lights on.\nOfficials in Saudi Arabia, which can burn as much as one-tenth of its oil production every summer just making electricity, want to preserve that black gold for more lucrative exports. One answer is adding more renewable energy, especially solar power. Another answer is nuclear power, and the country plans to build as many as 16 big nuclear power plants over the next 25 years; Riyadh already has a tender out for the first two plants, attracting the interest of Russia, China, France, South Korea\u2014and, especially, the United States.\nAmerica\u2019s nuclear industry, seeing almost zero chance of big new projects at home, is champing at the bit to get into what could be a $100 billion market. One industry executive has called the Saudi foray into nuclear power the \u201cdeal of the decade,\u201d and U.S. officials (and Saudi lobbyists) have been pressing the Trump administration to make it easier for U.S. nuclear firms to do business in Saudi Arabia. Top nuclear executives met with President Donald Trump at the White House this month to discuss Saudi Arabia, among other topics.\nTrump administration officials argue that America\u2019s nuclear industry should sell reactors to Saudi Arabia\u2014or else Russia or China will, potentially giving Moscow or Beijing a decades-long lucrative, strategic partnership with a keystone state in the Middle East. (On Friday, Saudi Arabia took another big step toward deepening its already tight energy relationship with China, inking a $10 billion deal to build a new refinery.)\nIn general, selling U.S. nuclear technology has another benefit, too, many experts say: The United States also exports its regulatory regime, safety and security standards, and strict protocols against nuclear proliferation, making American participation in the worldwide scramble for nuclear power a way to boost, rather than undermine, global security.\nBut in order to sell reactors overseas, the United States needs a formal agreement with the other country regulating just how those nuclear technologies will be used; to date, the United States has nearly 50 such agreements, known as \u201c123 agreements\u201d for the eponymous section of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act. For several years, Washington and Saudi Arabia have been negotiating their own 123 accord. But lately, those efforts have run into a buzz saw\u2014or rather, a Saudi bone saw.\nMany experts argue that fears that Saudi Arabia will turn nuclear reactors into breeders for a weapons program are overblown. Reactors use low-enriched uranium, while bombs need highly enriched uranium. And that kind of enrichment program is hard to keep hidden, not to mention costly. Reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to scrape out plutonium to build a bomb is even costlier.\n\u201cThere seems to be a conflating of legitimate national security issues with civilian nuclear technology. Saudi Arabia is not Iran. It\u2019s not North Korea,\u201d said Katie Tubb, a nuclear energy specialist at the Heritage Foundation. She says a standard 123 agreement, like the ones the United States has with dozens of other countries, would provide plenty of safeguards and oversight to ensure that Saudi Arabia used the technology responsibly. \u201cThere are a lot of steps from having a nuclear power industry to having a bomb,\u201d she said.\nSo what is the problem with helping Saudi Arabia meet its growing energy demand with foreign-built nuclear reactors, as countries from China to Vietnam to the United Arab Emirates are doing?\n\u201cThe simple answer is nothing. Civilian nuclear technology can be safeguarded, and it\u2019s not very well suited to producing nuclear weapons material,\u201d said Jon Wolfsthal, formerly a top nonproliferation official in President Barack Obama\u2019s administration and now director of the Nuclear Crisis Group.\nExcept for one thing, Wolfsthal added: \u201cSaudi Arabia doesn\u2019t just want reactors\u2014it wants the ability to enrich uranium. And that is very sensitive technology.\u201d\nAll states that have signed on to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), as Saudi Arabia has, theoretically have the right to enrich uranium. Insisting on that right, Saudi Arabia has refused to forswear uranium enrichment as part of any agreement with the United States. That stands in sharp contrast to the UAE, which inked a novel 123 agreement in 2009 that included an explicit ban on any enrichment activities as a safeguard against proliferation. But Saudi Arabia has refused to consider signing on to that so-called \u201cgold standard.\u201d\n\u201cThe unwillingness to sign up to the \u2018gold standard\u2019 gives people pause,\u201d Wolfsthal said.\nHolding onto a sovereign right to enrichment is one thing. A much bigger problem is that, the NPT notwithstanding, Saudi officials have openly said they\u2019d build a nuclear bomb of their own if Iran builds one.\n\u201cIf Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible,\u201d Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year.\nThat\u2019s the main reason that Riyadh\u2019s quest for nuclear power plants causes unease in a way that didn\u2019t happen with other countries that have turned to atomic energy. After its gold-plated nuclear deal with the UAE, for example, the United States signed a 123 agreement with Vietnam\u2014which pointedly did not include the same restrictions.\n\u201cUnlike any other potential partner, Saudi officials have been saying, \u2018We might need a nuclear weapon,\u2019\u201d said Laura S.H. Holgate, a former U.S. ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it is a very different prospect for us to be thinking about providing even the most peaceful nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Holgate, now the vice president for materials risk management at the Nuclear Threat Initiative.",

The continent is home to some of the world&rsquo;s<a href=\"https://qz.com/africa/1522126/african-economies-to-watch-in-2019-and-looming-debt/\"> fastest-</a>growing economies, and its population is expected to double by 2050.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At least for the time being, Africa doesn&rsquo;t have any other cost or competency alternatives,&rdquo; said Howard French, who teaches at the Columbia School of Journalism and has been the <em>New York Times</em> bureau chief in West and Central Africa and in China.</p>\n<p>The United States believes Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies that build critical infrastructure around the world might be installing so-called backdoors and using them to spy on behalf of the Chinese government. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has threatened to withhold intelligence from countries that use Chinese networks.</p>\n<p>Huawei&rsquo;s founder has told the<em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-ceo-hits-back-at-claims-company-spies-for-china-11547542616?mod=hp_lead_pos4&ns=prod/accounts-wsj\"> Wall Street Journal</a></em> that his company has never spied for China. But some experts are skeptical.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This idea that Huawei would never reveal anything to the Chinese state if asked is implausible because any Chinese company has to operate within the rules of the Chinese state,&rdquo; said French, the author of <em>Everything Under the Heavens: How the Past Helps Shape China&rsquo;s Push for Global Power</em>.</p>\n<p>In January 2018, the French newspaper<em><a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2018/01/26/a-addis-abeba-le-siege-de-l-union-africaine-espionne-par-les-chinois_5247521_3212.html\"> Le Monde</a></em> reported that Beijing had bugged the headquarters of the African Union&mdash;whose construction was paid for and built by China. Every night for five years the entire contents of the building&rsquo;s computer systems&mdash;which were installed by Huawei&mdash;were reportedly transferred to China. Microphones were found embedded in the desks and walls, according to the report. Both China and the African Union dismissed the allegations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Most policymakers and politicians in Africa, they don&rsquo;t really care,&rdquo; said Emeka Umejei, who teaches journalism at the American University of Nigeria. &ldquo;Africa is a pawn on the global chessboard in the ongoing geopolitical context. Everybody spies on Africa,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>David Shinn, a former U.S. ambassador to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, said that for many Africans, the suspicion is, &ldquo;if the Americans are peddling this argument, they have their own vested interests.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In Africa, where internet penetration lags behind the global<a href=\"https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats1.htm\"> average</a> at 35.2 percent, Huawei&rsquo;s compact rural cell towers have brought internet access to remote regions while the M-Pesa cellphone banking system, run on Huawei&rsquo;s Mobile Money platform, has been lauded for helping millions in East Africa move into the formal financial system.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The moment the networks are up, they kick off a whole host of other economies,&rdquo; said van Staden of the South African Institute of International Affairs.</p>\n<p>As Chinese-built internet expands across Africa, many fear that the continent&rsquo;s authoritarian leaders will seek to curb the internet&rsquo;s ability to spread popular discontent by adopting a Chinese style restricted web.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Chinese are explicitly pushing this idea of internet governance,&rdquo; said Joshua Meservey, a senior analyst with the Heritage Foundation. &ldquo;They frame it as a sovereignty issue, but what they are really talking about is the ability of a state to control the free flow of information online.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>China has encouraged foreign officials to follow its lead on internet control, conducting large-scale training for officials around the world, according to Freedom House&rsquo;s 2018 &ldquo;Freedom on the Net&rdquo; <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2018\">report</a>. The U.S. government-funded watchdog noted that increased activity by Chinese officials in Africa was followed by the passage of restrictive cybercrime and media laws in Tanzania and Uganda.</p>\n<p>Last year, the government of Zimbabwe signed a<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/24/beijings-big-brother-tech-needs-african-faces/\"> deal</a> with the Chinese company CloudWalk to build a nationwide facial recognition system. The data will flow back to China as a way of training its AI systems to recognize and track people from different ethnic backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Being the only viable provider of internet connectivity can also give China significant leverage over African governments, said Andrew Davenport, the chief operating officer of the RWR Advisory Group, a Washington-based consulting firm that tracks Chinese investment.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Beyond just espionage, there&rsquo;s leverage that comes with being the low-cost solution provider to a country whose political leadership might, in part, derive popular support from being able to offer connectivity to their population,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>With so much of the continent&rsquo;s telecoms infrastructure in Huawei&rsquo;s hands, it&rsquo;s going to be difficult for African countries to disentangle themselves from China, said Meservey of the Heritage Foundation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The U.S. is going to have to be strategic about how they approach this challenge. You can&rsquo;t just blunder in and say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s us or them.&rsquo; China does provide things that the continent needs,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>When U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton unveiled the Trump administration&rsquo;s new Africa strategy in December 2018, it was interpreted mainly as a strategy to counter China&rsquo;s influence on the continent. The United States continues to be the largest donor to Africa, but many questioned whether the U.S. resources allocated there would be sufficient to implement the kind of strategy Bolton envisioned.</p>\n<p>In lieu of having a viable technological alternative to offer in Africa, French of Columbia University said that the United States should make a positive, values-based case to encourage a move away from Huawei.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In authoritarian countries there is a real divide between the rulers and the populace, and I think on this issue I&rsquo;m pretty sure the populace in most of these countries if given the choice would prefer an open internet regime,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Bolton announced the new U.S. Africa strategy at a speech at a Washington-based think tank. When Chinese leader Xi Jinping unveiled China&rsquo;s Second Africa Policy in 2015, by contrast, he did it in South Africa, surrounded by African leaders who had gathered for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, noted Joshua Eisenman, an assistant professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s going to get attention. But John Bolton standing in Washington and giving a talk, then going back to his office to work on more important matters? There needs to be a follow-through,&rdquo; Eisenman said.</p>",

                "text": "The Chinese telecommunications company Huawei has made huge inroads in Africa in recent years even as the United States urges its allies around the world to avoid working with the firm over cybersecurity concerns.\nHuawei has built about 70 percent of the continent\u2019s 4G networks, vastly outpacing European rivals, according to Cobus van Staden, a senior China-Africa researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs. The construction is often accompanied by loans from Chinese state banks, which are approved faster and with fewer conditions than loans from international institutions.\nWhile concerns about Huawei are shared by other countries around the world, in Africa they are largely overshadowed by the imperative for greater internet access. The continent is home to some of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies, and its population is expected to double by 2050.\n\u201cAt least for the time being, Africa doesn\u2019t have any other cost or competency alternatives,\u201d said Howard French, who teaches at the Columbia School of Journalism and has been the New York Times bureau chief in West and Central Africa and in China.\nThe United States believes Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies that build critical infrastructure around the world might be installing so-called backdoors and using them to spy on behalf of the Chinese government. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has threatened to withhold intelligence from countries that use Chinese networks.\nHuawei\u2019s founder has told the Wall Street Journal that his company has never spied for China. But some experts are skeptical.\n\u201cThis idea that Huawei would never reveal anything to the Chinese state if asked is implausible because any Chinese company has to operate within the rules of the Chinese state,\u201d said French, the author of Everything Under the Heavens: How the Past Helps Shape China\u2019s Push for Global Power.\nIn January 2018, the French newspaper Le Monde reported that Beijing had bugged the headquarters of the African Union\u2014whose construction was paid for and built by China. Every night for five years the entire contents of the building\u2019s computer systems\u2014which were installed by Huawei\u2014were reportedly transferred to China. Microphones were found embedded in the desks and walls, according to the report. Both China and the African Union dismissed the allegations.\n\u201cMost policymakers and politicians in Africa, they don\u2019t really care,\u201d said Emeka Umejei, who teaches journalism at the American University of Nigeria. \u201cAfrica is a pawn on the global chessboard in the ongoing geopolitical context. Everybody spies on Africa,\u201d he said.\nDavid Shinn, a former U.S. ambassador to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, said that for many Africans, the suspicion is, \u201cif the Americans are peddling this argument, they have their own vested interests.\u201d\nIn Africa, where internet penetration lags behind the global average at 35.2 percent, Huawei\u2019s compact rural cell towers have brought internet access to remote regions while the M-Pesa cellphone banking system, run on Huawei\u2019s Mobile Money platform, has been lauded for helping millions in East Africa move into the formal financial system.\n\u201cThe moment the networks are up, they kick off a whole host of other economies,\u201d said van Staden of the South African Institute of International Affairs.\nAs Chinese-built internet expands across Africa, many fear that the continent\u2019s authoritarian leaders will seek to curb the internet\u2019s ability to spread popular discontent by adopting a Chinese style restricted web.\n\u201cThe Chinese are explicitly pushing this idea of internet governance,\u201d said Joshua Meservey, a senior analyst with the Heritage Foundation. \u201cThey frame it as a sovereignty issue, but what they are really talking about is the ability of a state to control the free flow of information online.\u201d\nChina has encouraged foreign officials to follow its lead on internet control, conducting large-scale training for officials around the world, according to Freedom House\u2019s 2018 \u201cFreedom on the Net\u201d report. The U.S. government-funded watchdog noted that increased activity by Chinese officials in Africa was followed by the passage of restrictive cybercrime and media laws in Tanzania and Uganda.\nLast year, the government of Zimbabwe signed a deal with the Chinese company CloudWalk to build a nationwide facial recognition system. The data will flow back to China as a way of training its AI systems to recognize and track people from different ethnic backgrounds.\nBeing the only viable provider of internet connectivity can also give China significant leverage over African governments, said Andrew Davenport, the chief operating officer of the RWR Advisory Group, a Washington-based consulting firm that tracks Chinese investment.\n\u201cBeyond just espionage, there\u2019s leverage that comes with being the low-cost solution provider to a country whose political leadership might, in part, derive popular support from being able to offer connectivity to their population,\u201d he said.\nWith so much of the continent\u2019s telecoms infrastructure in Huawei\u2019s hands, it\u2019s going to be difficult for African countries to disentangle themselves from China, said Meservey of the Heritage Foundation.\n\u201cThe U.S. is going to have to be strategic about how they approach this challenge. You can\u2019t just blunder in and say, \u2018It\u2019s us or them.\u2019 China does provide things that the continent needs,\u201d he said.\nWhen U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton unveiled the Trump administration\u2019s new Africa strategy in December 2018, it was interpreted mainly as a strategy to counter China\u2019s influence on the continent. The United States continues to be the largest donor to Africa, but many questioned whether the U.S. resources allocated there would be sufficient to implement the kind of strategy Bolton envisioned.\nIn lieu of having a viable technological alternative to offer in Africa, French of Columbia University said that the United States should make a positive, values-based case to encourage a move away from Huawei.\n\u201cIn authoritarian countries there is a real divide between the rulers and the populace, and I think on this issue I\u2019m pretty sure the populace in most of these countries if given the choice would prefer an open internet regime,\u201d he said.\nBolton announced the new U.S. Africa strategy at a speech at a Washington-based think tank. When Chinese leader Xi Jinping unveiled China\u2019s Second Africa Policy in 2015, by contrast, he did it in South Africa, surrounded by African leaders who had gathered for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, noted Joshua Eisenman, an assistant professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to get attention. But John Bolton standing in Washington and giving a talk, then going back to his office to work on more important matters? There needs to be a follow-through,\u201d Eisenman said.",

The focus of the elite will be on consolidating power, not liberalizing or reforming the country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Nazarbayev, the son of a shepherd, worked his way up through the Communist Party and became a rising star in politics in the 1980s, when the country, then part of the Soviet Union, was ruled by a gerontocracy. As the leader of a newly independent Kazakhstan beginning in 1991, he managed to successfully navigate a series of crises that threatened his fledgling state. The new country was the world&rsquo;s ninth largest and was rich with oil reserves, but Kazakhstan also inherited a massive stockpile of nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union. Nazarbayev helped solidify Kazakhstan&rsquo;s independence by transferring the nuclear stockpiles to Russia, with help from the United States, and later negotiating a series of crucial energy deals with Chevron, Mobil, and other corporations that helped build pipelines to the West.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In retrospect, he was clearly the most skillful of the leaders who assumed power in the collapse of the Soviet Union,&rdquo; said William Courtney, who served from 1992 to 1995 as the first U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan. &ldquo;He gained lots of legitimacy through denuclearizing and it was a savvy way to get others to respect Kazakhstan&rsquo;s independence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Navigating a tough international landscape will be a top priority for whomever is chosen as the next president, who will need to rely on Nazarbayev in his new role to deal with Kazakhstan&rsquo;s neighbors.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is no clear No. 2 that is next in line, so whoever is picked will need to get experience in international affairs,&rdquo; said Courtney, who is now a senior adjunct fellow at the Rand Corp. &ldquo;It has to be someone who has the stature and skill to sit down with Putin and Xi.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Kazakhstan is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union and the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a Moscow-led military bloc. Astana has also positioned itself as an integral part of Xi&rsquo;s signature Belt and Road Initiative. Kazakhstan maintains strong relations with both Moscow and Beijing despite more revanchist and nationalist foreign policies from both countries in recent years. Both countries, analysts say, will be watching closely to ensure that Kazakhstan remains compliant moving forward.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Russia has shown the world it will be aggressive when it needs to be, especially in the former Soviet Union,&rdquo; said Paul Stronski, the former director for Russia and Central Asia on the U.S. National Security Council under President Barack Obama. &ldquo;Kazakhstan doesn&rsquo;t have protection from anybody, and the consequences for Russia mucking around would be less than they have been elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Despite cooperating closely with Moscow, Nazarbayev has shown an independent streak at times in the face of Russian pressure. Astana abstained from recognizing Crimea as part of Russia during voting at the United Nations and has resisted Moscow&rsquo;s attempts to expand the Eurasian Economic Union into a political bloc. Kazakhstan has also walked a tightrope in its relations with Beijing as tens of thousands of ethnic Kazakhs have been <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/04/961387-concentrationcamps-china-xinjiang-internment-kazakh-muslim/\">caught up</a> in its vast internment camp system in China&rsquo;s neighboring Xinjiang province, and anti-Beijing feelings are prevalent in the country. Kazakh officials have sought to free some detainees, while <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/11/uighur-china-kazakhstan-astana/\">targeting and arresting</a> prominent activists who documented the scope of China&rsquo;s camp system.</p>\n<p>While Kazakhstan&rsquo;s first transition of power comes with major questions for international players, Kazakh officials have gone out of their way to signal that despite the resignation, Astana has no plans for drastic policy changes and that Nazarbayev will play a key role moving forward. Nazarbayev&rsquo;s first official phone call after his announcement on Tuesday was to Putin, and Tokayev, who will serve as acting president, is expected to address Kazakhstan&rsquo;s foreign policy when he is sworn in on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nazarbayev has credibility and stature with Kazakhstan&rsquo;s tough neighbors,&rdquo; said Stronski, who currently works as a Central Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. &ldquo;The problem is what happens when he is gone.&rdquo;</p>",

Nazarbayev helped solidify Kazakhstan\u2019s independence by transferring the nuclear stockpiles to Russia, with help from the United States, and later negotiating a series of crucial energy deals with Chevron, Mobil, and other corporations that helped build pipelines to the West.\n\u201cIn retrospect, he was clearly the most skillful of the leaders who assumed power in the collapse of the Soviet Union,\u201d said William Courtney, who served from 1992 to 1995 as the first U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan. \u201cHe gained lots of legitimacy through denuclearizing and it was a savvy way to get others to respect Kazakhstan\u2019s independence.\u201d\nNavigating a tough international landscape will be a top priority for whomever is chosen as the next president, who will need to rely on Nazarbayev in his new role to deal with Kazakhstan\u2019s neighbors.\n\u201cThere is no clear No. 2 that is next in line, so whoever is picked will need to get experience in international affairs,\u201d said Courtney, who is now a senior adjunct fellow at the Rand Corp. \u201cIt has to be someone who has the stature and skill to sit down with Putin and Xi.\u201d\nKazakhstan is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union and the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a Moscow-led military bloc. Astana has also positioned itself as an integral part of Xi\u2019s signature Belt and Road Initiative. Kazakhstan maintains strong relations with both Moscow and Beijing despite more revanchist and nationalist foreign policies from both countries in recent years. Both countries, analysts say, will be watching closely to ensure that Kazakhstan remains compliant moving forward.\n\u201cRussia has shown the world it will be aggressive when it needs to be, especially in the former Soviet Union,\u201d said Paul Stronski, the former director for Russia and Central Asia on the U.S. National Security Council under President Barack Obama. \u201cKazakhstan doesn\u2019t have protection from anybody, and the consequences for Russia mucking around would be less than they have been elsewhere.\u201d\nDespite cooperating closely with Moscow, Nazarbayev has shown an independent streak at times in the face of Russian pressure. Astana abstained from recognizing Crimea as part of Russia during voting at the United Nations and has resisted Moscow\u2019s attempts to expand the Eurasian Economic Union into a political bloc. Kazakhstan has also walked a tightrope in its relations with Beijing as tens of thousands of ethnic Kazakhs have been caught up in its vast internment camp system in China\u2019s neighboring Xinjiang province, and anti-Beijing feelings are prevalent in the country. Kazakh officials have sought to free some detainees, while targeting and arresting prominent activists who documented the scope of China\u2019s camp system.\nWhile Kazakhstan\u2019s first transition of power comes with major questions for international players, Kazakh officials have gone out of their way to signal that despite the resignation, Astana has no plans for drastic policy changes and that Nazarbayev will play a key role moving forward. Nazarbayev\u2019s first official phone call after his announcement on Tuesday was to Putin, and Tokayev, who will serve as acting president, is expected to address Kazakhstan\u2019s foreign policy when he is sworn in on Wednesday.\n\u201cNazarbayev has credibility and stature with Kazakhstan\u2019s tough neighbors,\u201d said Stronski, who currently works as a Central Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. \u201cThe problem is what happens when he is gone.\u201d",

White nationalists were known to be getting into cryptocurrencies during the 2017 bitcoin bubble, because PayPal kept cutting them off. The further joke is that Bitconnect is best known not for having helped its investors succeed but for taking them for millions, if not billions, of dollars. And Bitconnect started in 2016&mdash;but the shooter claimed to have made the money before he went <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-15/christchurch-shooting-brenton-tarrant-what-we-know/10904744\">traveling in 2010 or so</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/13/forget-bitcoin-try-your-mattress/\">Bitcoin</a> is a somewhat-decentralized payment system, with its own digital currency. You can speculate on the price of the currency&mdash;it peaked at just under $20,000 a bitcoin in December 2017, though the current price in March is wobbling around $4,000&mdash;but you can also send bitcoin payments to anyone, with no one being able to stop you from doing so.</p>\n<p>The far-right became interested in bitcoin as its members were cut off from more conventional payment channels.</p>\n<blockquote>The far-right became interested in bitcoin as its members were cut off from more conventional payment channels.</blockquote>\n<p>After neo-Nazis gathered from across the United States for the violent and bloody Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, many alt-right figures were cut off by PayPal and credit card processors. They began touting bitcoin as a payment alternative&mdash;helped by the cryptocurrency bubble still riding on its upward slope. The white nationalist Richard Spencer, always keen to jump to the front of a crowd, proclaimed bitcoin <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/bitcoins-boom-is-a-boon-for-extremist-groups/2017/12/26/9ca9c124-e59b-11e7-833f-155031558ff4_story.html\">&ldquo;the currency of the alt-right&rdquo;</a>&mdash;though he admitted he hadn&rsquo;t bought in himself.</p>\n<p>Yet there were ideological ties, as well as practical considerations, that may have helped push neo-Nazis toward bitcoin. Bitcoin advocates&mdash;who are very ideologically committed to cryptocurrency&mdash;were, for the most part, as horrified by last week&rsquo;s Islamophobic and racist murder as any reasonable human and have nothing but contempt for neo-Nazis.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin ideology is not a neo-Nazi ideology. However, bitcoin&rsquo;s right-libertarian anarcho-capitalism is very much in range of far-right extremism, particularly in the degree to which both propagate &ldquo;international banker&rdquo; and Rothschild-style conspiracy theories, and there are social spaces where the two cross directly, such as the /biz/ cryptocurrency forum on 4chan.</p>\n<p>David Golumbia is the author of the 2016 book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2GjG7le\"><em>The Politics of Bitcoin: Software as Right-Wing Extremism</em></a>. He documents the history of the ideas that went into bitcoin&mdash;such as long-running anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about &ldquo;international,&rdquo; i.e.<em>,</em> Jewish, bankers&mdash;and how these extremist ideas are propagated by the subculture, even as present-day enthusiasts would utterly repudiate the ideas&rsquo; origins.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think only a small number of cryptocurrency users are out-and-out fascists or Nazis,&rdquo; Golumbia told Foreign Policy. &ldquo;But I also suspect that the proportion of fascists in that world is higher than it is in the general population. That&rsquo;s due to the widespread presence of conspiratorial ideas in cryptocurrency communities. Many in cryptocurrency actively promote ignorance about what should be clear and uncontroversial facts about the world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Bitcoiners are, understandably, in some denial as to how cozy the two strains can get&mdash;nobody wants to think of their friends and associates as holding these vicious views. But the crossovers started early. Timothy C. May was an anarcho-capitalist and cryptographer who wrote the hugely influential &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html\">Crypto Anarchist Manifesto</a>&rdquo; in 1988, which sets out many of the demands and expectations that the bitcoin subculture started from 20 years later. May was lauded as a <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/enough-with-the-ico-me-so-horny-get-rich-quick-lambo-crypto\">respected elder philosopher</a> of bitcoin before his death in 2018.</p>\n<p>At this point, May&rsquo;s writings in the intervening decades came to greater public notice&mdash;such as <a href=\"https://scruz.general.narkive.com/29QgNUds/commie-rag-praises-mlk\">the text </a>in which he advocated &ldquo;a trip up the chimneys&rdquo; for 40 million Jewish, black, and Hispanic Americans. His bitcoin friends claimed May was just being a &ldquo;troll&rdquo;&mdash;in which case, he had not broken comedic character in his &ldquo;trolling&rdquo; in 30 years or more. The neo-Nazis themselves were delighted to embrace May with a <a href=\"https://archive.is/40lVr\">laudatory obituary</a> on the white nationalist site the <em>Daily Stormer</em>.</p>\n<p>At the peak of the 2017 bitcoin bubble, many worried that neo-Nazis who had bought into bitcoin were now rich and well-resourced.</p>\n<p>That wealth, however, wasn&rsquo;t as invisible as the far-right would like. Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous, and carries a public ledger of all transactions&mdash;so there are multiple sites that track payments to known bitcoin addresses for far-right and so-called alt-lite figures. The &ldquo;Neonazi BTC Tracker&rdquo; on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/neonaziwallets\">@neonaziwallets</a>), run by John Bambenek of the computer security service ThreatSTOP, documents the flow of cryptocurrency funds within the white nationalist subculture. Bambenek has also worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center on monitoring these groups.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin provides these neo-Nazi terror groups&mdash;and they are terror groups&mdash;the ability to raise and spend money in a way that&rsquo;s hard to disrupt,&rdquo; Bambenek told Foreign Policy. &ldquo;But it also provides an intelligence analyst like me unfettered ability to surveil them, because they surrender all their privacy rights by using it&mdash;because bitcoin&rsquo;s ledger is public.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cashing out your bitcoins can be tricky. There are only a few cryptocurrency exchanges that one can get U.S. dollars out of with any trust or reliability, and banks are reluctant to touch money from cryptos. &ldquo;Bitcoin only means something if you can turn it into actual money or stuff,&rdquo; Bambenek said. &ldquo;That can only happen in a few hundred places&mdash;and many of those places have been immensely helpful [to the anti-Nazi cause].&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Coinbase, the most popular U.S. bitcoin exchange, has stated that it actively seeks and removes violent extremists from its platform. Coinbase also removes the platforms used by the extremists&mdash;it removed the far-right Twitter clone Gab after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers allegedly planned his mass murder there, his last Gab <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/pa9jy8/gab-booted-off-the-internet-after-pittsburgh-shooting\">post</a> being: &ldquo;Screw your optics, I&rsquo;m going in.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It helps Bambenek&rsquo;s work that neo-Nazis lack the self-restraint not to publicly reveal themselves&mdash;for example, <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/bfcb84a37587590dcefefd345c34a4364e23a37502b44931def8dc96181a184d\">one recent transaction</a> sent 0.001488 bitcoins (about $5.93 at the time) to the <em>Daily Stormer</em>. &ldquo;1488&rdquo; is a number that is used as a signal between neo-Nazis&mdash;&ldquo;14&rdquo; is for the white supremacist slogan known as &ldquo;the fourteen words&rdquo; (&ldquo;We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children&rdquo;), and &ldquo;88&rdquo; is for &ldquo;Heil Hitler.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These guys can&rsquo;t help but identify themselves,&rdquo; Bambenek said. &ldquo;It surprises me they are such an odd combination of arrogance and incompetence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As of 2019, the online alt-right is less interested in bitcoin, said Daniel Harper, a researcher for the podcast <a href=\"http://idontspeakgerman.libsyn.com/\"><em>I Don&rsquo;t Speak German</em></a>, which covers the online alt-right and white nationalist sphere. Aside from being ridiculously traceable, bitcoin just isn&rsquo;t a good payment network.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin was always a means to an end&mdash;it was a way of evading some of the scrutiny of pushing cash around,&rdquo; Harper said.</p>\n<p>The white nationalist podcast network, desperate for a funding channel after being cut off from the conventional financial system, strongly advocated bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2017. &ldquo;There were a couple of guys who saw the Federal Reserve as inherently Jewish and inflating money. But they mainly just used it as a tool, more than an ideological commitment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Bitcoin also failed for the neo-Nazis as a funding channel, because cryptocurrency is still too hard to use. &ldquo;Nobody would go to the effort to get a bitcoin wallet to give them the 10 bucks a month that they were more than happy to give them.&rdquo; One neo-Nazi podcaster found a credit card processor that was fine with the content of his show but said he was untouchable for another reason: He was considered a money laundering risk because he dealt in cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>In 2019, white nationalist podcasts barely mention bitcoin. &ldquo;The numbers aren&rsquo;t going up, so they&rsquo;re not telling people to invest in it,&rdquo; Harper said. &ldquo;They all still have bitcoin wallets, so you can still donate to them by bitcoin&mdash;but it&rsquo;s just not a big deal for them anymore.&rdquo; For the Christchurch terrorist, dreams of being a cryptocurrency millionaire were probably just another cold joke.</p>",

                "text": "The neo-Nazi terrorist who takes credit for murdering 50 people in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15 released a manifesto. One of the claims inside it is that he did very well investing in cryptocurrency\u2014specifically, a collapsed Ponzi scheme called Bitconnect.\nLike much of the shooter\u2019s manifesto, the claim about cryptocurrency is almost certainly nonsense\u2014thrown in to get the media to chase their tails as they try to make sense of a deliberately confusing stew of alt-right memes and neo-Nazi in-jokes.\nThe U.S. president offers a glimpse of what four more years would look like after \u201ctotal acquittal\u201d by the Senate.\nThe reason it works as an in-joke is exactly because cryptocurrencies have become a favorite resource for the far-right\u2014if rarely a successful one. White nationalists were known to be getting into cryptocurrencies during the 2017 bitcoin bubble, because PayPal kept cutting them off. The further joke is that Bitconnect is best known not for having helped its investors succeed but for taking them for millions, if not billions, of dollars. And Bitconnect started in 2016\u2014but the shooter claimed to have made the money before he went traveling in 2010 or so.\nBitcoin is a somewhat-decentralized payment system, with its own digital currency. You can speculate on the price of the currency\u2014it peaked at just under $20,000 a bitcoin in December 2017, though the current price in March is wobbling around $4,000\u2014but you can also send bitcoin payments to anyone, with no one being able to stop you from doing so.\nThe far-right became interested in bitcoin as its members were cut off from more conventional payment channels.\nThe far-right became interested in bitcoin as its members were cut off from more conventional payment channels.\nAfter neo-Nazis gathered from across the United States for the violent and bloody Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, many alt-right figures were cut off by PayPal and credit card processors. They began touting bitcoin as a payment alternative\u2014helped by the cryptocurrency bubble still riding on its upward slope. The white nationalist Richard Spencer, always keen to jump to the front of a crowd, proclaimed bitcoin \u201cthe currency of the alt-right\u201d\u2014though he admitted he hadn\u2019t bought in himself.\nYet there were ideological ties, as well as practical considerations, that may have helped push neo-Nazis toward bitcoin. Bitcoin advocates\u2014who are very ideologically committed to cryptocurrency\u2014were, for the most part, as horrified by last week\u2019s Islamophobic and racist murder as any reasonable human and have nothing but contempt for neo-Nazis.\nBitcoin ideology is not a neo-Nazi ideology. However, bitcoin\u2019s right-libertarian anarcho-capitalism is very much in range of far-right extremism, particularly in the degree to which both propagate \u201cinternational banker\u201d and Rothschild-style conspiracy theories, and there are social spaces where the two cross directly, such as the /biz/ cryptocurrency forum on 4chan.\nDavid Golumbia is the author of the 2016 book The Politics of Bitcoin: Software as Right-Wing Extremism. He documents the history of the ideas that went into bitcoin\u2014such as long-running anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about \u201cinternational,\u201d i.e., Jewish, bankers\u2014and how these extremist ideas are propagated by the subculture, even as present-day enthusiasts would utterly repudiate the ideas\u2019 origins.\n\u201cI think only a small number of cryptocurrency users are out-and-out fascists or Nazis,\u201d Golumbia told Foreign Policy. \u201cBut I also suspect that the proportion of fascists in that world is higher than it is in the general population. That\u2019s due to the widespread presence of conspiratorial ideas in cryptocurrency communities. Many in cryptocurrency actively promote ignorance about what should be clear and uncontroversial facts about the world.\u201d\nBitcoiners are, understandably, in some denial as to how cozy the two strains can get\u2014nobody wants to think of their friends and associates as holding these vicious views. But the crossovers started early. Timothy C. May was an anarcho-capitalist and cryptographer who wrote the hugely influential \u201cCrypto Anarchist Manifesto\u201d in 1988, which sets out many of the demands and expectations that the bitcoin subculture started from 20 years later. May was lauded as a respected elder philosopher of bitcoin before his death in 2018.\nAt this point, May\u2019s writings in the intervening decades came to greater public notice\u2014such as the text in which he advocated \u201ca trip up the chimneys\u201d for 40 million Jewish, black, and Hispanic Americans. His bitcoin friends claimed May was just being a \u201ctroll\u201d\u2014in which case, he had not broken comedic character in his \u201ctrolling\u201d in 30 years or more. The neo-Nazis themselves were delighted to embrace May with a laudatory obituary on the white nationalist site the Daily Stormer.\nAt the peak of the 2017 bitcoin bubble, many worried that neo-Nazis who had bought into bitcoin were now rich and well-resourced.\nThat wealth, however, wasn\u2019t as invisible as the far-right would like. Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous, and carries a public ledger of all transactions\u2014so there are multiple sites that track payments to known bitcoin addresses for far-right and so-called alt-lite figures. The \u201cNeonazi BTC Tracker\u201d on Twitter (@neonaziwallets), run by John Bambenek of the computer security service ThreatSTOP, documents the flow of cryptocurrency funds within the white nationalist subculture. Bambenek has also worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center on monitoring these groups.\n\u201cBitcoin provides these neo-Nazi terror groups\u2014and they are terror groups\u2014the ability to raise and spend money in a way that\u2019s hard to disrupt,\u201d Bambenek told Foreign Policy. \u201cBut it also provides an intelligence analyst like me unfettered ability to surveil them, because they surrender all their privacy rights by using it\u2014because bitcoin\u2019s ledger is public.\u201d\nCashing out your bitcoins can be tricky. There are only a few cryptocurrency exchanges that one can get U.S. dollars out of with any trust or reliability, and banks are reluctant to touch money from cryptos. \u201cBitcoin only means something if you can turn it into actual money or stuff,\u201d Bambenek said. \u201cThat can only happen in a few hundred places\u2014and many of those places have been immensely helpful [to the anti-Nazi cause].\u201d\nCoinbase, the most popular U.S. bitcoin exchange, has stated that it actively seeks and removes violent extremists from its platform. Coinbase also removes the platforms used by the extremists\u2014it removed the far-right Twitter clone Gab after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers allegedly planned his mass murder there, his last Gab post being: \u201cScrew your optics, I\u2019m going in.\u201d\nIt helps Bambenek\u2019s work that neo-Nazis lack the self-restraint not to publicly reveal themselves\u2014for example, one recent transaction sent 0.001488 bitcoins (about $5.93 at the time) to the Daily Stormer. \u201c1488\u201d is a number that is used as a signal between neo-Nazis\u2014\u201c14\u201d is for the white supremacist slogan known as \u201cthe fourteen words\u201d (\u201cWe must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children\u201d), and \u201c88\u201d is for \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d\n\u201cThese guys can\u2019t help but identify themselves,\u201d Bambenek said. \u201cIt surprises me they are such an odd combination of arrogance and incompetence.\u201d\nAs of 2019, the online alt-right is less interested in bitcoin, said Daniel Harper, a researcher for the podcast I Don\u2019t Speak German, which covers the online alt-right and white nationalist sphere. Aside from being ridiculously traceable, bitcoin just isn\u2019t a good payment network.\n\u201cBitcoin was always a means to an end\u2014it was a way of evading some of the scrutiny of pushing cash around,\u201d Harper said.\nThe white nationalist podcast network, desperate for a funding channel after being cut off from the conventional financial system, strongly advocated bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2017. \u201cThere were a couple of guys who saw the Federal Reserve as inherently Jewish and inflating money. But they mainly just used it as a tool, more than an ideological commitment.\u201d\nBitcoin also failed for the neo-Nazis as a funding channel, because cryptocurrency is still too hard to use. \u201cNobody would go to the effort to get a bitcoin wallet to give them the 10 bucks a month that they were more than happy to give them.\u201d One neo-Nazi podcaster found a credit card processor that was fine with the content of his show but said he was untouchable for another reason: He was considered a money laundering risk because he dealt in cryptocurrency.\nIn 2019, white nationalist podcasts barely mention bitcoin. \u201cThe numbers aren\u2019t going up, so they\u2019re not telling people to invest in it,\u201d Harper said. \u201cThey all still have bitcoin wallets, so you can still donate to them by bitcoin\u2014but it\u2019s just not a big deal for them anymore.\u201d For the Christchurch terrorist, dreams of being a cryptocurrency millionaire were probably just another cold joke.",

A typical report in the <em>Economist</em> <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/02/23/the-decline-of-the-israeli-left\">described</a> Livni as a one-time Netanyahu prot&eacute;g&eacute; who &ldquo;came to support the establishment of a Palestinian state.&rdquo; In fact, Livni is a passionate advocate of separation from the Palestinians&mdash;and separation is not the same as support for a genuinely sovereign Palestinian state.</p>\n<p>With Livni gone, the most explicit proponent of separation in the election was Labor&rsquo;s Gabbay, who picked up a meager six seats. The party&rsquo;s platform frontloaded economic and social concerns but also addressed the need for a political initiative vis-&agrave;-vis the Palestinians. Like Livni, Labor&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.havoda.org.il/%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%A2/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%94-%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%94%D7%91%D7%99%D7%98%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9F/\">priority</a> in pushing separation from the Palestinians is the preservation of Israel&rsquo;s Jewish majority, or the state&rsquo;s &ldquo;national character.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote>Labor&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.havoda.org.il/%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%A2/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%94-%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%94%D7%91%D7%99%D7%98%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9F/\">priority</a> in pushing separation from the Palestinians is the preservation of Israel&rsquo;s Jewish majority, or the state&rsquo;s &ldquo;national character.&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<p>The Blue and White list also advocated a policy of separation, albeit in much <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-election-palestinians/netanyahu-election-rival-pledges-to-separate-from-palestinians-idUSKCN1QN24H\">vaguer</a> and less detailed terms.</p>\n<p>To understand the importance of distinguishing between calls for separation and support for a sovereign Palestinian state in what is currently Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory, one only needs to look at the content of what is being proposed.</p>\n<p>While Labor&rsquo;s election platform paid lip service to the idea of a Palestinian state, the devil is in the details. The parameters of this state&mdash;to be realized, Labor argued, at an undefined point in the future, based on unclear changes in circumstances&mdash;are demilitarization and Israel&rsquo;s permanent annexation of so-called settlement blocs in the occupied West Bank.</p>\n<p>The number and size of these blocs were not specified, but a separate commitment by Labor to complete the route of the separation wall along the West Bank provided a clue. Jerusalem, meanwhile, would be the capital of Israel, with Labor pledging a referendum on the removal of Palestinian neighborhoods, including Issawiya and the Shuafat refugee camp, from the municipality. Such a step serves a dual purpose: removing Palestinians&mdash;who currently make up about <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/palestinians-now-make-up-some-40-percent-of-jerusalem-s-population-1.6077642\">40 percent</a> of Jerusalem&rsquo;s population&mdash;from the city&rsquo;s figures and offering a low-cost practical gesture toward separation.</p>\n<p>The Blue and White list spelled out fewer details, but the broad brushstrokes were similar, with &ldquo;Israel retaining control of the Jordan Valley and blocs of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.&rdquo; Lapid <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections/yair-lapid-outlines-four-demands-for-peace-with-palestinians-1.7000533\">told</a> an audience that his idea of separation from the Palestinians included freedom of action for the Israeli army in Palestinian territory and the Jordan Valley remaining &ldquo;in Israeli hands.&rdquo; Former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief Moshe Yaalon, a member of Blue and White, explicitly <a href=\"http://www.thejewishstar.com/stories/how-blue-and-white-view-the-palestinians,16734\">rejected</a> Palestinian statehood, backing political separation and economic initiatives instead.</p>\n<p>Distinguishing between advocates of separation as opposed to statehood is vital, since for many Israelis separation is not about Palestinian sovereignty or self-determination.</p>\n<blockquote>Distinguishing between advocates of separation as opposed to statehood is vital, since for many Israelis separation is not about Palestinian sovereignty or self-determination.</blockquote>\n<p>Rather, the goal is to reduce Israeli responsibility for governing Palestinians and manage the so-called demographic threat they pose within Israel, as well as maintain control of all the territory of pre-1948 Palestine while also ensuring a Jewish majority of citizens. The 2015 platform of Lapid&rsquo;s Yesh Atid party, which was folded into the Blue and White list, for example, <a href=\"https://www.yeshatid.org.il/defense?languagecode=en\">argued</a> that &ldquo;the dilemma between keeping sections of the land of Israel and maintaining a Jewish majority requires us to give up Israeli territory.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This motivation shapes the details of what Israel is putting on the table&mdash;and the likelihood of Palestinians accepting it. Contrast the separation model with what real Palestinian statehood would look like: an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital that enjoys the full elements of sovereignty, including control of borders, airspace, and territorial integrity.</p>\n<p>During secret discussions with Prime Minister Menachem Begin in August 1978, ahead of the Camp David talks, then-opposition leader Shimon Peres <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-secret-talks-lay-bare-the-hawk-that-peres-once-was-1.5448602\">suggested</a> that there would be &ldquo;no choice but a functional compromise&rdquo; in the West Bank &ldquo;because we won&rsquo;t know what to do with the Arabs.&rdquo; Peres continued: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll reach 1.8 million Arabs, and I see our situation as getting very difficult. &hellip; I see them eating the Galilee, and my heart bleeds.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, such a motivation for separation did not produce the parameters of a Palestinian state. Peres <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-secret-talks-lay-bare-the-hawk-that-peres-once-was-1.5448602\">told</a> Begin: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t agree to return to the 1967 borders, Jerusalem must remain unified, and the defense of Israel must begin from the Jordan River with an IDF presence in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank].&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Compare this recipe with what Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin <a href=\"https://mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/mfadocuments/yearbook10/pages/address%20to%20the%20knesset%20by%20prime%20minister%20rabin%20on.aspx\">advocated</a> in 1995, shortly before his assassination&mdash;namely &ldquo;a Palestinian entity &hellip; which is less than a state,&rdquo; with Israel retaining major settlements, a &ldquo;united Jerusalem,&rdquo; and the Jordan River a &ldquo;security&rdquo; border in the &ldquo;broadest meaning.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As Dan Perry of The Associated Press perceptively put it in a <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/fb136087998e4d4c89fa09a70de814db\">February 2017 report</a>, when analyzing the cross-party commitment to maintaining Israel&rsquo;s Jewish majority, &ldquo;the more sophisticated nationalists profess to support a partition&mdash;albeit on terms the Palestinians aren&rsquo;t likely to accept.&rdquo; Such insights are unfortunately rare in Western media coverage, which tends to fall back on a simplistic &ldquo;dove versus hawk&rdquo; binary.</p>\n<p>There is another aspect of the case for separation that tends to slip under the radar: the consequences for Israel&rsquo;s Palestinian citizens of ethnonationalist politics and demographic scaremongering. Netanyahu makes the headlines for his warnings about Arab voters threatening Israel or his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/10/benjamin-netanyahu-says-israel-is-not-a-state-of-all-its-citizens\">declaration</a> that Israel is not a state of all its citizens, but supposedly moderate voices engage in the same sort of rhetoric.</p>\n<blockquote>Netanyahu makes the headlines for his warnings about Arab voters threatening Israel or his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/10/benjamin-netanyahu-says-israel-is-not-a-state-of-all-its-citizens\">declaration</a> that Israel is not a state of all its citizens, but supposedly moderate voices engage in the same sort of rhetoric.</blockquote>\n<p>Take the so-called nonpartisan group of senior retired army and intelligence officers known as Commanders for Israel&rsquo;s Security. The group <a href=\"https://anx.cis.org.il/\">warns</a> against annexation in terms almost indistinguishable from far-right parties in Europe&rsquo;s anti-immigration rhetoric, claiming that Palestinians will overburden a stretched health care system, &ldquo;compete&rdquo; with Israeli workers, and be able to &ldquo;return and live&rdquo; in towns from which they had been expelled.</p>\n<p>There is no reason why this kind of demographic battle discourse will exempt those Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. Racialized rhetoric may be primarily focused on Palestinians in the West Bank, but it is almost indistinguishable from&mdash;and can likely aggravate&mdash;the demographics-based incitement experienced by Palestinian citizens of Israel. Indeed, it was Livni who, in 2008, told high school students in Tel Aviv that &ldquo;once a Palestinian state is established,&rdquo; Palestinian citizens can be <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Israel/FM-takes-heat-over-Israeli-Arab-remark\">told</a> that &ldquo;the national solution for you is elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Finally, there will likely be a further need to distinguish between separation and a two-state solution in the context of the next Israeli Knesset. With Netanyahu set to advance some form of partial annexation of settlements and even more West Bank territory, the separation model is likely to be seen as a credible alternative to this more aggressively annexationist path.</p>\n<p>Yet the proposals advanced by the likes of Livni, Lapid, and Labor are neither the parameters of a genuine Palestinian state nor all that different from what Netanyahu has in mind.</p>\n<blockquote>Yet the proposals advanced by the likes of Livni, Lapid, and Labor are neither the parameters of a genuine Palestinian state nor all that different from what Netanyahu has in mind.</blockquote>\n<p>The commonalities are significant: a belief in Israel&rsquo;s right to all the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, a rejection of Palestinian sovereignty, and a desire to see some form of autonomous entity managing the day-to-day lives of the major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank. Given such shared fundamentals, it is not surprising that the material specifics are so similar.</p>\n<p>Without huge differences in practical terms among the various camps&rsquo; proposals, what explains the disagreements between these political forces? In essence, the dispute lies in assessments and calculations of Israel&rsquo;s strategic interests, as well as differing voter bases.</p>\n<p>Those in favor of the status quo, or formal annexation of Area C (an area amounting to roughly two-thirds of the West Bank designated as under full&mdash;though supposedly temporary&mdash;Israeli control in the Oslo Accords), are confident of Israel&rsquo;s ability to pursue such a path while maintaining, or even improving, its regional and international relations&mdash;including with partners as diverse as Eastern European leaders, African governments, and Persian Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>Those pushing separation, meanwhile, believe Israel&rsquo;s interests&mdash;domestic and foreign&mdash;are best served by a unilaterally defined separation from Palestinian population centers and, under admittedly and intentionally tricky-to-realize conditions, the establishment of a so-called Palestinian state.</p>\n<p>In a recent piece for <em>+972 Magazine</em>, the analyst and pollster <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/author/dahlia-scheindlin/\">Dahlia Scheindlin</a> <a href=\"https://972mag.com/israeli-election-campaign-two-state-conflict/140583/\">wrote</a>: &ldquo;For a long time, Israel told itself that it supported a two-state solution, and its leaders perpetuated the idea that Israel itself seeks peace through this path&mdash;even while taking contradictory steps on the ground.&rdquo; She continued: &ldquo;In this election cycle, based on the platforms of the major parties, the dissonance between self-image and reality seems to be dwindling.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The conflation of separation with genuine Palestinian statehood&mdash;by Western policymakers, journalists, and analysts&mdash;has been going on for some time. Distinguishing between the two is key to understanding the grim reality that the overwhelming majority of the Knesset, government and opposition alike, is occupied by parties that oppose basic Palestinian rights. If the international community wants to stop the next Netanyahu government&rsquo;s consolidation of a de facto one-state solution, it must look at the Israeli political establishment, including the supposedly progressive opposition, for what it is, not what it hoped it would be or how it presents itself.</p>",

                "text": "After a divisive election campaign, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has managed to overcome the challenge posed by Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid\u2019s Blue and White list. In an election that was dominated by the question of whether Netanyahu would be toppled, the Palestinians barely figured.\nOne voice that had particularly prioritized the Palestinian issue was not even on the ballot. Hatnuah party head Tzipi Livni\u2014following Avi Gabbay\u2019s public dismantling of her Zionist Camp alliance with the Labor Party\u2014opted to withdraw from the election, in light of her dismal polling figures.\nTrump\u2019s Nigerian Ban Is About Race, Not Security\nLivni\u2019s departure was widely described as a blow to the two-state solution. A typical report in the Economist described Livni as a one-time Netanyahu prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who \u201ccame to support the establishment of a Palestinian state.\u201d In fact, Livni is a passionate advocate of separation from the Palestinians\u2014and separation is not the same as support for a genuinely sovereign Palestinian state.\nWith Livni gone, the most explicit proponent of separation in the election was Labor\u2019s Gabbay, who picked up a meager six seats. The party\u2019s platform frontloaded economic and social concerns but also addressed the need for a political initiative vis-\u00e0-vis the Palestinians. Like Livni, Labor\u2019s priority in pushing separation from the Palestinians is the preservation of Israel\u2019s Jewish majority, or the state\u2019s \u201cnational character.\u201d\nLabor\u2019s priority in pushing separation from the Palestinians is the preservation of Israel\u2019s Jewish majority, or the state\u2019s \u201cnational character.\u201d\nThe Blue and White list also advocated a policy of separation, albeit in much vaguer and less detailed terms.\nTo understand the importance of distinguishing between calls for separation and support for a sovereign Palestinian state in what is currently Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory, one only needs to look at the content of what is being proposed.\nWhile Labor\u2019s election platform paid lip service to the idea of a Palestinian state, the devil is in the details. The parameters of this state\u2014to be realized, Labor argued, at an undefined point in the future, based on unclear changes in circumstances\u2014are demilitarization and Israel\u2019s permanent annexation of so-called settlement blocs in the occupied West Bank.\nThe number and size of these blocs were not specified, but a separate commitment by Labor to complete the route of the separation wall along the West Bank provided a clue. Jerusalem, meanwhile, would be the capital of Israel, with Labor pledging a referendum on the removal of Palestinian neighborhoods, including Issawiya and the Shuafat refugee camp, from the municipality. Such a step serves a dual purpose: removing Palestinians\u2014who currently make up about 40 percent of Jerusalem\u2019s population\u2014from the city\u2019s figures and offering a low-cost practical gesture toward separation.\nThe Blue and White list spelled out fewer details, but the broad brushstrokes were similar, with \u201cIsrael retaining control of the Jordan Valley and blocs of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.\u201d Lapid told an audience that his idea of separation from the Palestinians included freedom of action for the Israeli army in Palestinian territory and the Jordan Valley remaining \u201cin Israeli hands.\u201d Former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief Moshe Yaalon, a member of Blue and White, explicitly rejected Palestinian statehood, backing political separation and economic initiatives instead.\nDistinguishing between advocates of separation as opposed to statehood is vital, since for many Israelis separation is not about Palestinian sovereignty or self-determination.\nDistinguishing between advocates of separation as opposed to statehood is vital, since for many Israelis separation is not about Palestinian sovereignty or self-determination.\nRather, the goal is to reduce Israeli responsibility for governing Palestinians and manage the so-called demographic threat they pose within Israel, as well as maintain control of all the territory of pre-1948 Palestine while also ensuring a Jewish majority of citizens. The 2015 platform of Lapid\u2019s Yesh Atid party, which was folded into the Blue and White list, for example, argued that \u201cthe dilemma between keeping sections of the land of Israel and maintaining a Jewish majority requires us to give up Israeli territory.\u201d\nThis motivation shapes the details of what Israel is putting on the table\u2014and the likelihood of Palestinians accepting it. Contrast the separation model with what real Palestinian statehood would look like: an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital that enjoys the full elements of sovereignty, including control of borders, airspace, and territorial integrity.\nDuring secret discussions with Prime Minister Menachem Begin in August 1978, ahead of the Camp David talks, then-opposition leader Shimon Peres suggested that there would be \u201cno choice but a functional compromise\u201d in the West Bank \u201cbecause we won\u2019t know what to do with the Arabs.\u201d Peres continued: \u201cWe\u2019ll reach 1.8 million Arabs, and I see our situation as getting very difficult. \u2026 I see them eating the Galilee, and my heart bleeds.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, such a motivation for separation did not produce the parameters of a Palestinian state. Peres told Begin: \u201cWe don\u2019t agree to return to the 1967 borders, Jerusalem must remain unified, and the defense of Israel must begin from the Jordan River with an IDF presence in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank].\u201d\nCompare this recipe with what Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin advocated in 1995, shortly before his assassination\u2014namely \u201ca Palestinian entity \u2026 which is less than a state,\u201d with Israel retaining major settlements, a \u201cunited Jerusalem,\u201d and the Jordan River a \u201csecurity\u201d border in the \u201cbroadest meaning.\u201d\nAs Dan Perry of The Associated Press perceptively put it in a February 2017 report, when analyzing the cross-party commitment to maintaining Israel\u2019s Jewish majority, \u201cthe more sophisticated nationalists profess to support a partition\u2014albeit on terms the Palestinians aren\u2019t likely to accept.\u201d Such insights are unfortunately rare in Western media coverage, which tends to fall back on a simplistic \u201cdove versus hawk\u201d binary.\nThere is another aspect of the case for separation that tends to slip under the radar: the consequences for Israel\u2019s Palestinian citizens of ethnonationalist politics and demographic scaremongering. Netanyahu makes the headlines for his warnings about Arab voters threatening Israel or his declaration that Israel is not a state of all its citizens, but supposedly moderate voices engage in the same sort of rhetoric.\nNetanyahu makes the headlines for his warnings about Arab voters threatening Israel or his declaration that Israel is not a state of all its citizens, but supposedly moderate voices engage in the same sort of rhetoric.\nTake the so-called nonpartisan group of senior retired army and intelligence officers known as Commanders for Israel\u2019s Security. The group warns against annexation in terms almost indistinguishable from far-right parties in Europe\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric, claiming that Palestinians will overburden a stretched health care system, \u201ccompete\u201d with Israeli workers, and be able to \u201creturn and live\u201d in towns from which they had been expelled.\nThere is no reason why this kind of demographic battle discourse will exempt those Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. Racialized rhetoric may be primarily focused on Palestinians in the West Bank, but it is almost indistinguishable from\u2014and can likely aggravate\u2014the demographics-based incitement experienced by Palestinian citizens of Israel. Indeed, it was Livni who, in 2008, told high school students in Tel Aviv that \u201conce a Palestinian state is established,\u201d Palestinian citizens can be told that \u201cthe national solution for you is elsewhere.\u201d\nFinally, there will likely be a further need to distinguish between separation and a two-state solution in the context of the next Israeli Knesset. With Netanyahu set to advance some form of partial annexation of settlements and even more West Bank territory, the separation model is likely to be seen as a credible alternative to this more aggressively annexationist path.\nYet the proposals advanced by the likes of Livni, Lapid, and Labor are neither the parameters of a genuine Palestinian state nor all that different from what Netanyahu has in mind.\nYet the proposals advanced by the likes of Livni, Lapid, and Labor are neither the parameters of a genuine Palestinian state nor all that different from what Netanyahu has in mind.\nThe commonalities are significant: a belief in Israel\u2019s right to all the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, a rejection of Palestinian sovereignty, and a desire to see some form of autonomous entity managing the day-to-day lives of the major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank. Given such shared fundamentals, it is not surprising that the material specifics are so similar.\nWithout huge differences in practical terms among the various camps\u2019 proposals, what explains the disagreements between these political forces? In essence, the dispute lies in assessments and calculations of Israel\u2019s strategic interests, as well as differing voter bases.\nThose in favor of the status quo, or formal annexation of Area C (an area amounting to roughly two-thirds of the West Bank designated as under full\u2014though supposedly temporary\u2014Israeli control in the Oslo Accords), are confident of Israel\u2019s ability to pursue such a path while maintaining, or even improving, its regional and international relations\u2014including with partners as diverse as Eastern European leaders, African governments, and Persian Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia.\nThose pushing separation, meanwhile, believe Israel\u2019s interests\u2014domestic and foreign\u2014are best served by a unilaterally defined separation from Palestinian population centers and, under admittedly and intentionally tricky-to-realize conditions, the establishment of a so-called Palestinian state.\nIn a recent piece for +972 Magazine, the analyst and pollster Dahlia Scheindlin wrote: \u201cFor a long time, Israel told itself that it supported a two-state solution, and its leaders perpetuated the idea that Israel itself seeks peace through this path\u2014even while taking contradictory steps on the ground.\u201d She continued: \u201cIn this election cycle, based on the platforms of the major parties, the dissonance between self-image and reality seems to be dwindling.\u201d\nThe conflation of separation with genuine Palestinian statehood\u2014by Western policymakers, journalists, and analysts\u2014has been going on for some time. Distinguishing between the two is key to understanding the grim reality that the overwhelming majority of the Knesset, government and opposition alike, is occupied by parties that oppose basic Palestinian rights. If the international community wants to stop the next Netanyahu government\u2019s consolidation of a de facto one-state solution, it must look at the Israeli political establishment, including the supposedly progressive opposition, for what it is, not what it hoped it would be or how it presents itself.",

But right-wing nationalists in Ukraine certainly did. The far-right Azov movement was founded in 2014 to help defend Ukraine against invasion by Russian-led proxy forces.</p>\n<blockquote>The far-right Azov movement was founded in 2014 to help defend Ukraine against invasion by Russian-led proxy forces.</blockquote>\n<p>It began by recapturing the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, near the annexed Crimean Peninsula, from Russian proxies. (Russia has since partially <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/11/29/goodbye-grotius-hello-putin-russia-ukraine-sea-of-azov-kerch-strait-south-china-sea-unclos-law-of-sea-crimea/\">blockaded the Kerch Strait</a>, harassing Ukrainian vessels and nearly cutting off the Azov coast from the rest of Ukraine.)</p>\n<p>The Azov movement&rsquo;s early victories also earned it a reputation as a place where far-right extremists and self-confessed neo-Nazis could make themselves at home. In more recent months, it has become better known for its street battles against incumbent President Petro Poroshenko, injuring almost two dozen police officers in one violent <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/22-police-officers-injured-after-clashes-with-far-right-protesters-in-cherkasy-as-poroshenko-delivered-a-speech.html\">protest</a> against alleged corruption in Poroshenko&rsquo;s inner circle.</p>\n<p>Members of the Azov movement have made Venner a martyr. On the anniversary of his death in 2015, Azov members laid flowers and lit a candle for him in front of the French Embassy in Kiev. They give lectures on his works, post quotes from him on social media, and even sell bookmarks with his face and name emblazoned on them.</p>\n<p>Venner is one of several icons of France&rsquo;s Nouvelle Droite (New Right) who, beginning in the late 1960s, started laying out a new strategy for the postwar far-right. And while the Azov movement is a relatively new player on the global far-right scene, the key to understanding it has its roots nowhere near Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Venner was a writer and historian known for his works on themes popular with the far-right in France and beyond, from conspiracies to destroy Europe with Muslim migration to apologetics for France&rsquo;s Nazi-collaborating Vichy regime. In a note found on his body, he lamented what he called &ldquo;the crime of the replacement of our people&rdquo; by Muslim immigrants.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a clear nod to the so-called &ldquo;great replacement&rdquo; theory promoted by fellow Frenchman Renaud Camus, a theory that <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/16/the-inspiration-for-terrorism-in-new-zealand-came-from-france-christchurch-brenton-tarrant-renaud-camus-jean-raspail-identitarians-white-nationalism/\">continues to inspire</a> right-wing extremists&mdash;including the Christchurch terrorist, who plagiarized the title of one of Camus&rsquo;s books for the title of his rambling manifesto. Venner&rsquo;s final blog post before his death was an anti-LGBT rant: France was, at the time, in the midst of a heated debate over same-sex marriage.</p>\n<p>But Venner made a far-right name for himself decades before. In 1962, he was released after spending 18 months in jail for being part of the Organisation Arm&eacute;e Secr&egrave;te (OAS). A right-wing terrorist group that was formed to try to prevent Algerian independence, the OAS killed an estimated 2,000 people in just over a year and tried to assassinate President Charles de Gaulle several times.</p>\n<p>Nostalgia for the lost Algerian cause&mdash;the failed effort to keep Algeria a part of France&mdash;became a core cause of the French far-right. Former OAS members, including Jean-Marie Le Pen, were instrumental in setting up the far-right National Front, the party now called the National Rally, and led by Le Pen&rsquo;s daughter, Marine Le Pen.</p>\n<p>That year Venner wrote <em>Toward a Positive Critique</em>, a work that the Mexico-based political scientist Tamir Bar-On, the author of two books on the French New Right, calls a far-right version of Vladimir Lenin&rsquo;s &ldquo;What Is to Be Done?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This book helped pave the way for what would become known as the Nouvelle Droite in the late 1960s. Alongside figures such as Alain de Benoist and the late Guillaume Faye, Venner and others at GRECE (&ldquo;Research and Study Group for European Civilization,&rdquo; spelling out the French word for Greece) began laying the groundwork for how more palatable far-right movements could gain currency in the wake of Nazism.</p>\n<p>The 1930s-era politics of unabashed racism, unguarded language, and unsubtle advocacy of imperialism and authoritarianism were, to say the least, poisoned by the legacy of World War II and French colonial wars in then-French Indochina and Algeria. Authors such as Venner called for a new approach; far-right nationalists needed to clean up their image and cast aside violence, overt racism, extreme rhetoric, and even electoral politics</p>\n<blockquote>Authors such as Venner called for a new approach; far-right nationalists needed to clean up their image and cast aside violence, overt racism, extreme rhetoric, and even electoral politics</blockquote>\n<p>to some extent and focus more on what Bar-On <a href=\"http://www.politicalcapital.hu/pc-admin/source/documents/Tamir%20Bar-On%20interview%20by%20Benson%20Cheung_1.pdf\">calls</a> &ldquo;the long route through the wilderness.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The goal for this new far-right was to shape attitudes and beliefs over a much longer period of time and spend less time fretting about getting votes and achieving immediate political power. &ldquo;The approach,&rdquo; Bar-On told Foreign Policy, &ldquo;was basically, &lsquo;We have to challenge the left by capturing the laboratories of thought.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With its roots in a still-smoldering war, this might not sound like familiar territory for Ukraine&rsquo;s Azov movement. It was originally formed as a volunteer battalion in 2014 as a response to Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s proxy invasion of eastern Ukraine while Ukraine&rsquo;s army itself was a shambles. It didn&rsquo;t take long for the Azov Battalion to become known for having some of the fiercest fighters on the Ukrainian side&mdash;but it also quickly became known for its embrace of self-confessed neo-Nazis into its ranks.</p>\n<p>While most observers tend to associate anyone far-right with pro-Kremlin sympathies, there was and continues to be a core of far-right extremists and outright neo-Nazis who have no time for Putin. According to Azov, Russia is a multicultural, multiethnic land, one filled with migrants and Muslim minorities and led by a man with no actual interest in preserving what one Azov ideologist euphemistically called &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkaF9xwzr2M&fbclid=IwAR0ZcwuYJt02UPTrA56wQFrlyfqPNO4X7PsS79RHoH9wR8K0xbny2JVWwPM\">ethnocultural values</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Five years later, the battalion itself is now an official part of Ukraine&rsquo;s National Guard. Azov formed a political party, the National Corps, in 2016; it&rsquo;s headed by Andriy Biletsky, who was once the leader of the neo-Nazi &ldquo;Patriot of Ukraine&rdquo; organization. Last year, Azov introduced the National Militia, a paramilitary group whose existence continues to worry a number of human rights groups, given their propensity for street violence and vigilantism. With a claimed 10,000 members, Azov looks set to be a fixture on the Ukrainian political scene for a while yet.</p>\n<p>The Azov movement is not seeking to gain power through elections or realistically wrest territory back from Russian control. It is doing something far more subtle.</p>\n<blockquote>The Azov movement is not seeking to gain power through elections or realistically wrest territory back from Russian control. It is doing something far more subtle.</blockquote>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a word for what the Azov movement is doing, a common one in the parlance of the French New Right: metapolitics&mdash;or, in <a href=\"http://www.politicalcapital.hu/pc-admin/source/documents/Tamir%20Bar-On%20interview%20by%20Benson%20Cheung_1.pdf\">Bar-On&rsquo;s words</a>, &ldquo;the capture of cultural power [as] the precondition for the capture of political power.&rdquo; In less academic phrasing: The movement focuses on playing a longer-term game and worries less about poll numbers and popular support and more about whether the mainstream is shifting closer and closer to its turf.</p>\n<p>The French New Right built the idea of metapolitics, ironically, on foundations laid by a left-wing icon&mdash;the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci. He argued that controlling culture was the key to controlling power and that those who controlled the institutions of thought effectively controlled society. Azov&rsquo;s leaders are certainly familiar with the term &ldquo;metapolitics.&rdquo; The movement&rsquo;s international secretary and one of its chief ideologues, Olena Semenyaka, peppers her speech and writings online with references to it. Speaking to FP in Kiev, Semenyaka was transparent about the French New Right&rsquo;s influence on Azov&rsquo;s work and the idea of metapolitics. Azov&rsquo;s strategy, Semenyaka said, is to build &ldquo;cultural hegemony&rdquo;&mdash;a term of Gramsci&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;or cultural revolution as a means of gaining political hegemony.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The goal, according to Semenyaka, is to pull Ukrainian society closer to Azov&rsquo;s side of the political divide. &ldquo;We want to bridge this gap between nationalism and the rest of society,&rdquo; she said. And even as the National Corps barely registers in polls&mdash;Biletsky announced in January that he wasn&rsquo;t going to take part in March&rsquo;s first-round presidential elections&mdash;the movement is following a decades-old script laid out in France. Semenyaka brags about everything the Azov movement does, from mixed martial arts sessions and weapons trainings with military equipment to hosting a network of youth camps and support groups for veterans of the ongoing war with Russian-backed forces in the country&rsquo;s east.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s part of what Semenyaka calls an effort to neutralize resistance to far-right ideas in Ukrainian society. Ukrainians support their initiatives without knowing they&rsquo;re linked to the Azov movement, she said, and are happy to support the movement when its sponsorship or involvement is revealed. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that it&rsquo;s easier to garner support for a movement when it&rsquo;s still associated in much of the public mind with a heroic defense of the country against foreign invaders. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t associate it with some far-right radicals who do some violence in the streets,&rdquo; she said. Instead, the hope is that they will think, &ldquo;&lsquo;These guys are OK. They&rsquo;re doing something for us. The government doesn&rsquo;t have such programs for us&mdash;why wouldn&rsquo;t we support them?&rsquo;&rdquo; and end up backing the movement. &ldquo;We just want to overcome this demonized image,&rdquo; she added.</p>\n<p>That demonized image is one thing that Azov doesn&rsquo;t want people to notice. Despite Semenyaka&rsquo;s protestations to FP that the movement was far from neo-Nazi-friendly, it doesn&rsquo;t take much scratching of the surface to find the darker paint beneath. Azov has hosted neo-Nazi concerts replete with swastikas, tried to <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/02/15/defend-the-white-race-american-extremists-being-co-opted-by-ukraines-far-right/\">recruit</a> foreign far-right extremists, openly assaulted feminist, LGBT, and leftist activists, and cleared a Roma camp with hammers and axes.</p>\n<blockquote>Azov has hosted neo-Nazi concerts replete with swastikas, tried to <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/02/15/defend-the-white-race-american-extremists-being-co-opted-by-ukraines-far-right/\">recruit</a> foreign far-right extremists, openly assaulted feminist, LGBT, and leftist activists, and cleared a Roma camp with hammers and axes.</blockquote>\n<p>Azov&rsquo;s less cunning edges aren&rsquo;t hard to find, even if it&rsquo;s something it doesn&rsquo;t like to talk about; Semenyaka herself has been photographed giving a Hitler salute with a swastika flag behind her.</p>\n<p>The French New Right, however, has long been much more subtle than this. Azov is trying to borrow from this playbook. Semenyaka told FP about a project inspired by the French New Right theorist Guillaume Faye, who wrote a dictionary explaining New Right terms&mdash;an effort to turn anti-democratic, xenophobic, or even racist ideas into something much more palatable for the mainstream.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t say what &lsquo;chauvinism&rsquo; is, as leftists would do,&rdquo; Semenyaka said. &ldquo;He explains what &lsquo;ethnomasochism&rsquo; is for instance. He would say that whites are always guilty, and by definition you have to embrace multiculturalism, create a single human race.&rdquo; References to European culture rather than &ldquo;the white race&rdquo; is another popular euphemism in these circles. Semenyaka said the movement has plans to create a video based on terms in Faye&rsquo;s book for a Ukrainian audience, an idea that she said has the backing of Biletsky. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a witty way to gain political hegemony,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Political power, however, isn&rsquo;t anywhere near the horizon for Azov. With Biletsky&rsquo;s withdrawal from Ukraine&rsquo;s presidential race&mdash;he had been polling at less than 1 percent&mdash;Azov&rsquo;s National Corps party is focusing on October&rsquo;s parliamentary elections, where it hopes to surpass the 5 percent threshold to get into Ukraine&rsquo;s parliament. (It currently holds two seats from single-member districts and is polling around 1 percent.)</p>\n<p>Semenyaka didn&rsquo;t sound worried. It&rsquo;s all an opportunity, she claimed, to gain new contacts, new &ldquo;political technologists&rdquo;&mdash;a term common in the post-Soviet sphere to describe the art of political manipulation&mdash;new supporters, and, eventually, to become what she called &ldquo;a party of ideas.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Besides, there isn&rsquo;t time for campaigning at the moment. Azov&rsquo;s leading lights are too busy building relationships with far-right figures from across Europe and beyond&mdash;at least those who aren&rsquo;t pro-Kremlin. It&rsquo;s not the easiest task, considering that much of the European far-right, from France&rsquo;s National Rally and Germany&rsquo;s Alternative for Germany to the <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/20/the-new-dutch-disease-is-white-nationalism/\">upstart</a> <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/28/the-new-face-of-the-dutch-far-right-fvd-thierry-baudet-netherlands-pvv-geert-wilders/\">Thierry Baudet</a> in the Netherlands, seem to be firm fans of the Kremlin. Still, groups such as the neo-Nazi Third Way and the Nordic Resistance Movement&mdash;a group now banned in Finland&mdash;and figures such as the American white nationalist Greg Johnson have visited Azov in the Ukrainian capital in the past few months.</p>\n<p>Members of Azov, including Semenyaka, regularly travel across Europe to connect with other far-right groups, from Italy&rsquo;s CasaPound to Germany&rsquo;s National Democratic Party, which German authorities have tried to ban. And while some members of these movements are more sympathetic to the Kremlin than to Kiev, Azov&rsquo;s ideologists sound confident that they can convert more than a few of them to their side and build a different transnational far-right movement with themselves at the center.</p>\n<p>Azov is also forming connections with less subtle, and openly violent, far-right extremists whom Venner might have warned it to ignore.

It has left the group little recourse but to find allies among the most violent fringes, especially the Social Bastion movement.

Azov benefits from a unique situation for an ambitious far-right group&mdash;an ongoing war started by an imperial neighbor, an already conservative and nationalistic political climate, and the alleged protection of one of the country&rsquo;s most powerful politicians, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who is widely <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/08/30/ukrainian-far-right-fighters-white-supremacists-trained-major-european-security-firm/\">believed</a> to be Azov&rsquo;s patron.</p>\n<p>Above all, however, Ukraine&rsquo;s political climate is one where Azov&rsquo;s outright violent actions don&rsquo;t often get the scrutiny they deserve. Azov hopes, in that environment, it can start to turn some of Venner&rsquo;s far-right fantasies into reality.</p>",

                "text": "KIEV, Ukraine\u2014If you\u2019ve ever been to Paris, you\u2019ve probably snapped a photo of the very spot that\u2019s a symbol for a far-right movement more than 1,000 miles away.\nIt\u2019s here along the banks of the Seine, at Notre Dame Cathedral, that an aging French man decided to make what he called a \u201csacrifice\u201d a few years ago. Before Tuesday\u2019s devastating fire it might have been the most recent time the centuries-old cathedral made such shocking news.\nThe U.S. president offers a glimpse of what four more years would look like after \u201ctotal acquittal\u201d by the Senate.\nOn May 21, 2013, 78-year-old Dominique Venner, a man known in France as a \u201cnationalist extremist\u201d and a \u201cmilitant populist with a violent past,\u201d walked into the 12th-century cathedral, stood next to the altar, pulled out a revolver, and shot himself.\nOutside of France, few knew Venner\u2019s name. But right-wing nationalists in Ukraine certainly did. The far-right Azov movement was founded in 2014 to help defend Ukraine against invasion by Russian-led proxy forces.\nThe far-right Azov movement was founded in 2014 to help defend Ukraine against invasion by Russian-led proxy forces.\nIt began by recapturing the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, near the annexed Crimean Peninsula, from Russian proxies. (Russia has since partially blockaded the Kerch Strait, harassing Ukrainian vessels and nearly cutting off the Azov coast from the rest of Ukraine.)\nThe Azov movement\u2019s early victories also earned it a reputation as a place where far-right extremists and self-confessed neo-Nazis could make themselves at home. In more recent months, it has become better known for its street battles against incumbent President Petro Poroshenko, injuring almost two dozen police officers in one violent protest against alleged corruption in Poroshenko\u2019s inner circle.\nMembers of the Azov movement have made Venner a martyr. On the anniversary of his death in 2015, Azov members laid flowers and lit a candle for him in front of the French Embassy in Kiev. They give lectures on his works, post quotes from him on social media, and even sell bookmarks with his face and name emblazoned on them.\nVenner is one of several icons of France\u2019s Nouvelle Droite (New Right) who, beginning in the late 1960s, started laying out a new strategy for the postwar far-right. And while the Azov movement is a relatively new player on the global far-right scene, the key to understanding it has its roots nowhere near Ukraine.\nVenner was a writer and historian known for his works on themes popular with the far-right in France and beyond, from conspiracies to destroy Europe with Muslim migration to apologetics for France\u2019s Nazi-collaborating Vichy regime. In a note found on his body, he lamented what he called \u201cthe crime of the replacement of our people\u201d by Muslim immigrants.\nIt\u2019s a clear nod to the so-called \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory promoted by fellow Frenchman Renaud Camus, a theory that continues to inspire right-wing extremists\u2014including the Christchurch terrorist, who plagiarized the title of one of Camus\u2019s books for the title of his rambling manifesto. Venner\u2019s final blog post before his death was an anti-LGBT rant: France was, at the time, in the midst of a heated debate over same-sex marriage.\nBut Venner made a far-right name for himself decades before. In 1962, he was released after spending 18 months in jail for being part of the Organisation Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te (OAS). A right-wing terrorist group that was formed to try to prevent Algerian independence, the OAS killed an estimated 2,000 people in just over a year and tried to assassinate President Charles de Gaulle several times.\nNostalgia for the lost Algerian cause\u2014the failed effort to keep Algeria a part of France\u2014became a core cause of the French far-right. Former OAS members, including Jean-Marie Le Pen, were instrumental in setting up the far-right National Front, the party now called the National Rally, and led by Le Pen\u2019s daughter, Marine Le Pen.\nThat year Venner wrote Toward a Positive Critique, a work that the Mexico-based political scientist Tamir Bar-On, the author of two books on the French New Right, calls a far-right version of Vladimir Lenin\u2019s \u201cWhat Is to Be Done?\u201d\nThis book helped pave the way for what would become known as the Nouvelle Droite in the late 1960s. Alongside figures such as Alain de Benoist and the late Guillaume Faye, Venner and others at GRECE (\u201cResearch and Study Group for European Civilization,\u201d spelling out the French word for Greece) began laying the groundwork for how more palatable far-right movements could gain currency in the wake of Nazism.\nThe 1930s-era politics of unabashed racism, unguarded language, and unsubtle advocacy of imperialism and authoritarianism were, to say the least, poisoned by the legacy of World War II and French colonial wars in then-French Indochina and Algeria. Authors such as Venner called for a new approach; far-right nationalists needed to clean up their image and cast aside violence, overt racism, extreme rhetoric, and even electoral politics\nAuthors such as Venner called for a new approach; far-right nationalists needed to clean up their image and cast aside violence, overt racism, extreme rhetoric, and even electoral politics\nto some extent and focus more on what Bar-On calls \u201cthe long route through the wilderness.\u201d\nThe goal for this new far-right was to shape attitudes and beliefs over a much longer period of time and spend less time fretting about getting votes and achieving immediate political power. \u201cThe approach,\u201d Bar-On told Foreign Policy, \u201cwas basically, \u2018We have to challenge the left by capturing the laboratories of thought.\u2019\u201d\nWith its roots in a still-smoldering war, this might not sound like familiar territory for Ukraine\u2019s Azov movement. It was originally formed as a volunteer battalion in 2014 as a response to Vladimir Putin\u2019s proxy invasion of eastern Ukraine while Ukraine\u2019s army itself was a shambles. It didn\u2019t take long for the Azov Battalion to become known for having some of the fiercest fighters on the Ukrainian side\u2014but it also quickly became known for its embrace of self-confessed neo-Nazis into its ranks.\nWhile most observers tend to associate anyone far-right with pro-Kremlin sympathies, there was and continues to be a core of far-right extremists and outright neo-Nazis who have no time for Putin. According to Azov, Russia is a multicultural, multiethnic land, one filled with migrants and Muslim minorities and led by a man with no actual interest in preserving what one Azov ideologist euphemistically called \u201cethnocultural values.\u201d\nFive years later, the battalion itself is now an official part of Ukraine\u2019s National Guard. Azov formed a political party, the National Corps, in 2016; it\u2019s headed by Andriy Biletsky, who was once the leader of the neo-Nazi \u201cPatriot of Ukraine\u201d organization. Last year, Azov introduced the National Militia, a paramilitary group whose existence continues to worry a number of human rights groups, given their propensity for street violence and vigilantism. With a claimed 10,000 members, Azov looks set to be a fixture on the Ukrainian political scene for a while yet.\nThe Azov movement is not seeking to gain power through elections or realistically wrest territory back from Russian control. It is doing something far more subtle.\nThe Azov movement is not seeking to gain power through elections or realistically wrest territory back from Russian control. It is doing something far more subtle.\nThere\u2019s a word for what the Azov movement is doing, a common one in the parlance of the French New Right: metapolitics\u2014or, in Bar-On\u2019s words, \u201cthe capture of cultural power [as] the precondition for the capture of political power.\u201d In less academic phrasing: The movement focuses on playing a longer-term game and worries less about poll numbers and popular support and more about whether the mainstream is shifting closer and closer to its turf.\nThe French New Right built the idea of metapolitics, ironically, on foundations laid by a left-wing icon\u2014the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci. He argued that controlling culture was the key to controlling power and that those who controlled the institutions of thought effectively controlled society. Azov\u2019s leaders are certainly familiar with the term \u201cmetapolitics.\u201d The movement\u2019s international secretary and one of its chief ideologues, Olena Semenyaka, peppers her speech and writings online with references to it. Speaking to FP in Kiev, Semenyaka was transparent about the French New Right\u2019s influence on Azov\u2019s work and the idea of metapolitics. Azov\u2019s strategy, Semenyaka said, is to build \u201ccultural hegemony\u201d\u2014a term of Gramsci\u2019s\u2014\u201cor cultural revolution as a means of gaining political hegemony.\u201d\nThe goal, according to Semenyaka, is to pull Ukrainian society closer to Azov\u2019s side of the political divide. \u201cWe want to bridge this gap between nationalism and the rest of society,\u201d she said. And even as the National Corps barely registers in polls\u2014Biletsky announced in January that he wasn\u2019t going to take part in March\u2019s first-round presidential elections\u2014the movement is following a decades-old script laid out in France. Semenyaka brags about everything the Azov movement does, from mixed martial arts sessions and weapons trainings with military equipment to hosting a network of youth camps and support groups for veterans of the ongoing war with Russian-backed forces in the country\u2019s east.\nIt\u2019s part of what Semenyaka calls an effort to neutralize resistance to far-right ideas in Ukrainian society. Ukrainians support their initiatives without knowing they\u2019re linked to the Azov movement, she said, and are happy to support the movement when its sponsorship or involvement is revealed. It doesn\u2019t hurt that it\u2019s easier to garner support for a movement when it\u2019s still associated in much of the public mind with a heroic defense of the country against foreign invaders. \u201cThey don\u2019t associate it with some far-right radicals who do some violence in the streets,\u201d she said. Instead, the hope is that they will think, \u201c\u2018These guys are OK. They\u2019re doing something for us. The government doesn\u2019t have such programs for us\u2014why wouldn\u2019t we support them?\u2019\u201d and end up backing the movement. \u201cWe just want to overcome this demonized image,\u201d she added.\nThat demonized image is one thing that Azov doesn\u2019t want people to notice. Despite Semenyaka\u2019s protestations to FP that the movement was far from neo-Nazi-friendly, it doesn\u2019t take much scratching of the surface to find the darker paint beneath. Azov has hosted neo-Nazi concerts replete with swastikas, tried to recruit foreign far-right extremists, openly assaulted feminist, LGBT, and leftist activists, and cleared a Roma camp with hammers and axes.\nAzov has hosted neo-Nazi concerts replete with swastikas, tried to recruit foreign far-right extremists, openly assaulted feminist, LGBT, and leftist activists, and cleared a Roma camp with hammers and axes.\nAzov\u2019s less cunning edges aren\u2019t hard to find, even if it\u2019s something it doesn\u2019t like to talk about; Semenyaka herself has been photographed giving a Hitler salute with a swastika flag behind her.\nThe French New Right, however, has long been much more subtle than this. Azov is trying to borrow from this playbook. Semenyaka told FP about a project inspired by the French New Right theorist Guillaume Faye, who wrote a dictionary explaining New Right terms\u2014an effort to turn anti-democratic, xenophobic, or even racist ideas into something much more palatable for the mainstream.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t say what \u2018chauvinism\u2019 is, as leftists would do,\u201d Semenyaka said. \u201cHe explains what \u2018ethnomasochism\u2019 is for instance. He would say that whites are always guilty, and by definition you have to embrace multiculturalism, create a single human race.\u201d References to European culture rather than \u201cthe white race\u201d is another popular euphemism in these circles. Semenyaka said the movement has plans to create a video based on terms in Faye\u2019s book for a Ukrainian audience, an idea that she said has the backing of Biletsky. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a witty way to gain political hegemony,\u201d she said.\nPolitical power, however, isn\u2019t anywhere near the horizon for Azov. With Biletsky\u2019s withdrawal from Ukraine\u2019s presidential race\u2014he had been polling at less than 1 percent\u2014Azov\u2019s National Corps party is focusing on October\u2019s parliamentary elections, where it hopes to surpass the 5 percent threshold to get into Ukraine\u2019s parliament. (It currently holds two seats from single-member districts and is polling around 1 percent.)\nSemenyaka didn\u2019t sound worried. It\u2019s all an opportunity, she claimed, to gain new contacts, new \u201cpolitical technologists\u201d\u2014a term common in the post-Soviet sphere to describe the art of political manipulation\u2014new supporters, and, eventually, to become what she called \u201ca party of ideas.\u201d\nBesides, there isn\u2019t time for campaigning at the moment. Azov\u2019s leading lights are too busy building relationships with far-right figures from across Europe and beyond\u2014at least those who aren\u2019t pro-Kremlin. It\u2019s not the easiest task, considering that much of the European far-right, from France\u2019s National Rally and Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany to the upstart Thierry Baudet in the Netherlands, seem to be firm fans of the Kremlin. Still, groups such as the neo-Nazi Third Way and the Nordic Resistance Movement\u2014a group now banned in Finland\u2014and figures such as the American white nationalist Greg Johnson have visited Azov in the Ukrainian capital in the past few months.\nMembers of Azov, including Semenyaka, regularly travel across Europe to connect with other far-right groups, from Italy\u2019s CasaPound to Germany\u2019s National Democratic Party, which German authorities have tried to ban. And while some members of these movements are more sympathetic to the Kremlin than to Kiev, Azov\u2019s ideologists sound confident that they can convert more than a few of them to their side and build a different transnational far-right movement with themselves at the center.\nAzov is also forming connections with less subtle, and openly violent, far-right extremists whom Venner might have warned it to ignore. U.S.-based white supremacists from the Rise Above Movement visited Kiev last year before being arrested back in the United States for a number of violent attacks they perpetrated in 2017. Hendrik M\u00f6bus, a convicted murderer and founder of the German neo-Nazi band Absurd, spoke at an Azov event last December.\nBut in Venner\u2019s home country, Azov hasn\u2019t had much luck with the mostly pro-Kremlin French far-right; Semenyaka freely admits that her efforts to make connections with members of the National Rally have gone nowhere. It has left the group little recourse but to find allies among the most violent fringes, especially the Social Bastion movement. Over the last two years, Azov\u2019s friends in Social Bastion have beaten people with metal bars while calling them \u201cdirty Arabs\u201d and broken a man\u2019s jaw\nOver the last two years, Azov\u2019s friends in Social Bastion have beaten people with metal bars while calling them \u201cdirty Arabs\u201d and broken a man\u2019s jaw\nwhen they mistook him for a local anti-fascist activist. Last year, as a group of men walked past a Social Bastion hangout in the central French city of Clermont-Ferrand, one of them joked to his friends, \u201cC\u2019est le local des fachos\u201d (\u201cThis is the fascist local\u201d). Members of Social Bastion emerged and attacked the men, breaking one of their legs. It\u2019s hardly the more sanitized, more respectable face of the far-right that Venner would have wanted.\nAs Notre Dame continued to smolder earlier this week, Azov made it perfectly clear what it meant to them. An Azov-affiliated record label posted the message \u201cEurope is falling apart\u201d on social media alongside a drawing of Notre Dame burning. \u201cFirst, Venner\u2019s sacrifice, now the fire,\u201d the post stated.\nAzov\u2019s French-inspired march through the wilderness has impressed its far-right friends abroad, many of whom are more than happy to work with Azov to try to build a new international far-right movement. Azov benefits from a unique situation for an ambitious far-right group\u2014an ongoing war started by an imperial neighbor, an already conservative and nationalistic political climate, and the alleged protection of one of the country\u2019s most powerful politicians, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who is widely believed to be Azov\u2019s patron.\nAbove all, however, Ukraine\u2019s political climate is one where Azov\u2019s outright violent actions don\u2019t often get the scrutiny they deserve. Azov hopes, in that environment, it can start to turn some of Venner\u2019s far-right fantasies into reality.",

Slowly, a few companies have emerged that are able to do it. AMSilk, a German company founded in 2008, is one of them. After completing the laborious process of turning academic research on growing spider silk proteins in <em>E. coli </em>bacteria into a commercial operation, AMSilk is selling its bio-based products as a replacement for traditional silk additives in cosmetics and as a coating for breast implants.</p>\n<p>During a recent visit by <em>Forbes</em> to AMSilk&rsquo;s offices in the suburban Munich town of Planegg, cofounder and chief science officer Lin R&ouml;mer took items out of a corner cabinet to show them off. There were silk sprays, breathable nail polishes and even a watch band that the company developed recently with the luxury brand Omega, which will be sold in limited-edition quantity. &ldquo;The long-term vision is to make many products for everyday use,&rdquo; R&ouml;mer says.</p>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fe.infogram.com%2Fdc644429-5ff7-4c3c-a065-49bd94ea07f8%3Fsrc%3Dembed&url=https%3A%2F%2Finfogram.com%2Famsilk-1hxr4zle1e7e6yo&image=https%3A%2F%2Finfogram-thumbs-1024.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fff888f49-73f6-4306-b309-a837800a4778.jpg&key=3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=infogram\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><em>Spider silk without the spiders: AMSilk CEO Jens Klein (left) and chief science officer Lin R&ouml;mer; a flask of silk powder; a prototype shoe for Adidas.</em></p>\n<p>Unlike silkworms, spiders can&rsquo;t be farmed, because they are territorial and cannibalistic. Proponents of growing spider silk in a lab hope to get the advantages of its strength and softness and also to have an alternative to silkworm silk, which requires the death of thousands of silkworm cocoons. They also hope that lab-grown silk, which is biodegradable, can ultimately replace materials like polyester that are made with petrochemicals and harm the environment. &ldquo;We all know that to use crude oil to make polyester and throw it in the ocean where it will be for thousands of years is not the best way to go,&rdquo; R&ouml;mer says.</p>\n<p>A core of AMSilk&rsquo;s business is selling its lab-grown silk gels and powders to cosmetics companies, which use silk additives to give skin products their glow and shampoo its shine.

                "text": "or decades, scientists and entrepreneurs have fantasized about creating lab-grown spider silk, which is renowned for its strength and softness. Slowly, a few companies have emerged that are able to do it. AMSilk, a German company founded in 2008, is one of them. After completing the laborious process of turning academic research on growing spider silk proteins in E. coli bacteria into a commercial operation, AMSilk is selling its bio-based products as a replacement for traditional silk additives in cosmetics and as a coating for breast implants.\nDuring a recent visit by Forbes to AMSilk\u2019s offices in the suburban Munich town of Planegg, cofounder and chief science officer Lin R\u00f6mer took items out of a corner cabinet to show them off. There were silk sprays, breathable nail polishes and even a watch band that the company developed recently with the luxury brand Omega, which will be sold in limited-edition quantity. \u201cThe long-term vision is to make many products for everyday use,\u201d R\u00f6mer says.\nSpider silk without the spiders: AMSilk CEO Jens Klein (left) and chief science officer Lin R\u00f6mer; a flask of silk powder; a prototype shoe for Adidas.\nUnlike silkworms, spiders can\u2019t be farmed, because they are territorial and cannibalistic. Proponents of growing spider silk in a lab hope to get the advantages of its strength and softness and also to have an alternative to silkworm silk, which requires the death of thousands of silkworm cocoons. They also hope that lab-grown silk, which is biodegradable, can ultimately replace materials like polyester that are made with petrochemicals and harm the environment. \u201cWe all know that to use crude oil to make polyester and throw it in the ocean where it will be for thousands of years is not the best way to go,\u201d R\u00f6mer says.\nA core of AMSilk\u2019s business is selling its lab-grown silk gels and powders to cosmetics companies, which use silk additives to give skin products their glow and shampoo its shine. Along with more than $30 million in funding, this gives it the cash flow to pursue riskier projects, such as a deal it signed last year with Airbus to develop a new high-performance material that would incorporate its silk fiber. That\u2019s a lower-key approach than its venture capital-funded American competitor Bolt Threads, which has been focused on the higher-profile textile market.\nIndustry is extremely interested in new and innovative materials, says Jens Klein, AMSilk\u2019s CEO, who previously worked for chemical company Evonik Industries. \u201cSpider silk,\u201d he says, \u201chas long been the holy grail of material innovation.\u201d\nReach Amy Feldman at afeldman@forbes.com.",

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks to local residents during an organizing event, Sunday, Feb.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A raft of new polls has come out in recent weeks about taxing the rich, keyed to, among other things, Elizabeth Warren&rsquo;s wealth tax proposal and suggestions from other politicians that the top marginal rate be raised on top earners.</p>\n<p>A good place to begin to look at public reactions is <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://news.gallup.com/poll/1714/Taxes.aspx\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1714/Taxes.aspx\">Gallup&rsquo;s</a> trend data. The pollster asks whether different groups of individuals are paying their fair share, too little, or too much in federal taxes. &ldquo;Upper-income people&rdquo; is one of Gallup&rsquo;s categories. In 1992, 77% said upper-income people were paying too little. In Gallup&rsquo;s 2018 question, 62% gave that response. The &ldquo;too little&rdquo; response has hovered in the low sixties for the past seven years. Twenty-six percent in 2018 said upper-income people pay their fair share, and around 10% said they pay too much. Other polls paint a similar picture.</p>\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not the end of the story. Another <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://news.gallup.com/poll/235439/partisan-divide-benefit-having-rich-people-expands.aspx\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/235439/partisan-divide-benefit-having-rich-people-expands.aspx\">Gallup</a> question asks about whether the US benefits from having a class of rich people. Fifty-eight percent agreed last year, down barely from 62% who gave that response nearly 30 years ago in 1990. In 2018, 43% of Democrats, 57% of independents, and 81% of Republicans said the country benefitted. Gallup reported that the partisan divide has widened since 2012, with a drop in Democrats&rsquo; views about the benefit, while Republican views have remained stable.</p>\n<p>Many polls reveal ambivalence about how the rich contribute to society. In a <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HHP_Sept2018_Crosstabs_Memo-RegisteredVoters.pdf\" href=\"https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HHP_Sept2018_Crosstabs_Memo-RegisteredVoters.pdf\">September 2018 Harvard/Harris</a> online survey, 70%, agreed that Wall Street was absolutely essential because it provides the money businesses must have for investment. An equally robust 69% in another question said that most people on Wall Street would be willing to break the law if they believed they could make a lot of money and get away with it.</p>\n<p>The polls can&rsquo;t tell us what is driving the current push for higher taxes. The proposals aren&rsquo;t new. Nor are poll responses which usually show support for increasing taxes on the rich. It&rsquo;s possible that politicians such as Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren lit a spark with discussions of inequality, spiking public and pollsters&rsquo; interest. A new more liberal Democratic House could also be driving attention. Partisan divisions on many questions are deeper today. Republicans and Democrats differ profoundly, for example, on why someone is rich. Sixty-two percent of Democrats in a September <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/04/partisans-are-divided-over-the-fairness-of-the-u-s-economy-and-why-people-are-rich-or-poor/\" href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/04/partisans-are-divided-over-the-fairness-of-the-u-s-economy-and-why-people-are-rich-or-poor/\">Pew Research Center poll</a> said it was because the person had advantages in life. Seventy-one percent of Republicans said it was because the person worked harder than most other people. Not quite mirror images, but close. Nineteen percent of Democrats in a <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://news.gallup.com/poll/246236/satisfied-quality-life-opportunity.aspx\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/246236/satisfied-quality-life-opportunity.aspx\">January Gallup question</a> were satisfied with the way income and wealth are distributed in the US; 65% of Republicans were.</p>\n<p>So how appealing are a wealth tax or raising marginal rates? Several new polls suggest that a wealth tax is more popular than raising tax rates. In a late <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/02/01/republicans-2020-trump-victory-tax-reform\" href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/02/01/republicans-2020-trump-victory-tax-reform\">January <em data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/02/01/republicans-2020-trump-victory-tax-reform\">Economist</em>/YouGov online survey</a>, 50% supported an annual wealth tax (41% were opposed).

                "text": "A raft of new polls has come out in recent weeks about taxing the rich, keyed to, among other things, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax proposal and suggestions from other politicians that the top marginal rate be raised on top earners.\nA good place to begin to look at public reactions is Gallup\u2019s trend data. The pollster asks whether different groups of individuals are paying their fair share, too little, or too much in federal taxes. \u201cUpper-income people\u201d is one of Gallup\u2019s categories. In 1992, 77% said upper-income people were paying too little. In Gallup\u2019s 2018 question, 62% gave that response. The \u201ctoo little\u201d response has hovered in the low sixties for the past seven years. Twenty-six percent in 2018 said upper-income people pay their fair share, and around 10% said they pay too much. Other polls paint a similar picture.\nBut that\u2019s not the end of the story. Another Gallup question asks about whether the US benefits from having a class of rich people. Fifty-eight percent agreed last year, down barely from 62% who gave that response nearly 30 years ago in 1990. In 2018, 43% of Democrats, 57% of independents, and 81% of Republicans said the country benefitted. Gallup reported that the partisan divide has widened since 2012, with a drop in Democrats\u2019 views about the benefit, while Republican views have remained stable.\nMany polls reveal ambivalence about how the rich contribute to society. In a September 2018 Harvard/Harris online survey, 70%, agreed that Wall Street was absolutely essential because it provides the money businesses must have for investment. An equally robust 69% in another question said that most people on Wall Street would be willing to break the law if they believed they could make a lot of money and get away with it.\nThe polls can\u2019t tell us what is driving the current push for higher taxes. The proposals aren\u2019t new. Nor are poll responses which usually show support for increasing taxes on the rich. It\u2019s possible that politicians such as Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren lit a spark with discussions of inequality, spiking public and pollsters\u2019 interest. A new more liberal Democratic House could also be driving attention. Partisan divisions on many questions are deeper today. Republicans and Democrats differ profoundly, for example, on why someone is rich. Sixty-two percent of Democrats in a September Pew Research Center poll said it was because the person had advantages in life. Seventy-one percent of Republicans said it was because the person worked harder than most other people. Not quite mirror images, but close. Nineteen percent of Democrats in a January Gallup question were satisfied with the way income and wealth are distributed in the US; 65% of Republicans were.\nSo how appealing are a wealth tax or raising marginal rates? Several new polls suggest that a wealth tax is more popular than raising tax rates. In a late January Economist/YouGov online survey, 50% supported an annual wealth tax (41% were opposed). More Republicans supported than opposed the wealth tax in this poll, but not in other polls. In an early February Morning Consult/Politico poll, 61% of registered voters favored a wealth tax and 20% were opposed. In the poll, a majority of Democrats, 51%, and Republicans, 55%, had not heard much or anything at all about it. In the new CNN poll, 54% favored and 39% opposed a new tax on \u201cwealth in addition to the income tax which would only apply to those who net worth is $50 million or more.\u201d In this poll, 56 percent of Republicans were opposed (36% were in favor). Seventy-four percent supported a wealth tax in a new online Hill/HarrisX poll.\nIn the Economist/YouGov poll, 44 percent supporting adding a 70% tax bracket on income (33% were opposed). In CNN\u2019s poll, 41% favored raising the top rate to 70% while 52% were opposed. In Morning Consult\u2019s poll, 45% supported this move.\nIn questions about tax policy, income thresholds matter. Seventy percent of registered voters in a January Fox News poll favored increasing tax rates only on families earning over $10 million a year, 65% favored raising them only on families making over $1 million, and fewer than half, 44%, favored a hike on families earning $250,000 a year.\nAs the debate proceeds, understanding Americans\u2019 views about taxes is taxing, but the public\u2019s general instincts are clear.",

The steps to sound personal finance decisions are much more simple than you realize. The hard part is actually executing your plan and sticking with it, especially when there&rsquo;s so many distractions in our everyday lives.</p>\n<p>To begin, you need to know what your financials goals are and why they are important. The key here is to write them down and re-evaluate them periodically as you solidify your financial footing. If you have a spouse, you&rsquo;ll want to go through this exercise together.</p>\n<p>For some families, their goals might include paying down credit card debt so they no longer have it looming over them, while for others it may be increasing their 401(k) contributions. You&rsquo;ll decide what makes the most sense for you and your loved ones.</p>\n<p>PROMOTED</p>\n<p><strong>Focus On Financial Literacy First</strong></p>\n<p>Once you know the specific targets you want to reach, you&rsquo;ll need to become <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://investedwallet.com/become-financially-literate/\" href=\"https://investedwallet.com/become-financially-literate/\">financially literate</a>. The internet has more than enough information to get you started. If you feel stuck and aren&rsquo;t sure where to start, I run a personal finance site called <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://thefinancetwins.com/\" href=\"https://thefinancetwins.com/\">The Finance Twins</a>, which is full of free introductory personal finance materials and tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Understand The Difference Between Assets And Liabilities</strong></p>\n<p>All purchases are not created equal. If you&rsquo;re focused on building wealth and securing your financial future, you&rsquo;ll want to maximize assets that hold and potentially grow in value, while limiting liabilities or financial obligations.</p>\n<p>One common fallacy you&rsquo;ll want to be aware of is that purchasing a vehicle is smart financial decision since it is an asset. While technically true that your car is an asset from an accounting standpoint, <a data-ga-track=\"InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/11/02/your-new-car-payment-might-delay-your-retirement-by-years/\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/11/02/your-new-car-payment-might-delay-your-retirement-by-years/\">your auto is a depreciating asset</a> and quickly loses its value. Focus instead on investments and savings as true appreciating assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Your Money Is Important, So You Need To Treat It That Way</strong></p>\n<p>You would never start a project or a cross-country road trip without a plan. Yet, so many people manage their money by crossing their fingers and hoping for the best.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll want to <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://thefinancetwins.com/how-to-make-a-budget/\" href=\"https://thefinancetwins.com/how-to-make-a-budget/\">develop a plan to save, budget and invest your money</a>. Focus on your savings rate, or the amount of money you are able to save from every paycheck. A rough guideline that you&rsquo;ll want to aim for is to invest 15% of your income for the future. A <a data-ga-track=\"InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/11/27/roth-iras-a-millennial-savers-dream/\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/11/27/roth-iras-a-millennial-savers-dream/\">Traditional or Roth IRA</a> is a good place to start if you are already taking advantage of a workplace retirement plan.</p>\n<p>Remember, getting your spending in check isn&rsquo;t an exercise in how much pain you can tolerate to pinch a few pennies. It&rsquo;s about designing a life and standard of living that is sustainable and still provides you with the same amount of happiness and pleasure, while allowing you to save and invest for your future.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask For Advice If You Feel Stuck</strong></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve gone a few weeks with a toothache that won&rsquo;t go away, chances are that you&rsquo;ll eventually find yourself staring at a bright light at the dentist's office. However, when your finances are hurting, you probably aren&rsquo;t running to a financial advisor or financial planner for help.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s true that you might not get the same immediate gratification from visiting a financial planner because it takes time and effort to notice a difference in your financial life, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it any less important. After all, you&rsquo;ll be glad that you&rsquo;ll have the money to afford a visit to the dentist if you need one.</p>\n<p>Not all financial advisors are created equal so take the time to find someone you life and trust. You&rsquo;ll be glad you took the time to shop around and didn&rsquo;t go with the first person you met with, unless they are the right fit.</p>\n<p><strong>Leverage Technology To Stay Financially Focused</strong></p>\n<p>There are countless apps and websites related to tracking your spending, managing your money, or setting up a budget. Take advantage of your favorite ones to stay on track with your goals. There are even <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://www.instagram.com/thefinancetwins/\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thefinancetwins/\">Instagram accounts dedicated to inspiring positive financial decisions</a>. An extra five minutes everyday looking at your financial situation instead of looking at pictures of cats on your newsfeed will go a long way.</p>\n<p>Similarly, research has shown that <a data-ga-track=\"InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/08/01/you-may-need-to-trick-your-brain-to-stop-avoiding-financial-decisions/\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/08/01/you-may-need-to-trick-your-brain-to-stop-avoiding-financial-decisions/\">small nudges</a> can make a large difference in influencing your behavior, so it will help you if you go on this journey with a couple of friends. Something as simple as a friend texting you in the morning asking about your side hustle, might be all you need to actually go out and earn some extra money.</p>\n<p><strong>Develop An Investor Mindset</strong></p>\n<p>If your goal is to have financial freedom, then you need to start acting like it and have an investor-like mindset. You need to approach your everyday financial decisions with your goals in mind. Start by paying your future self first as soon as you get your paycheck. Don&rsquo;t just save whatever is left over. Your <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://thefinancetwins.com/personal-savings-rate/\" href=\"https://thefinancetwins.com/personal-savings-rate/\">savings rate</a> will tell you how you are doing. If you aren&rsquo;t earning enough money to reach your goals, you need to find ways to make more money.</p>\n<p>The cost of living has increased faster than wages have over the past few decades, which means it&rsquo;s <a data-ga-track=\"InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/08/07/youll-probably-make-less-than-your-parents/\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/08/07/youll-probably-make-less-than-your-parents/\">harder than ever to live a comfortable life</a>. But it&rsquo;s still possible.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the next recession hits, but you&rsquo;ll be glad you made the decision to set a solid financial foundation for your family.</p>",

                "text": "It\u2019s no secret that recessions and dips in economic activity come and go in waves. With headlines increasingly warning of a pending economic slowdown, there are several indicators which point in that direction.\nTighter monetary policy, a meager increase in February payrolls, the softening of stock market performance, and President Trump\u2019s ongoing trade war with China are all concerning.\nIf the sound of a recession makes your stomach lurch, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re not financially prepared if it were to happen soon. The government shutdown that began in December 2018 and dragged on through January 2019 clearly highlighted the negative impact and incredible hardship that most Americans would face if they missed a few paychecks.\nSo if you don\u2019t feel ready for the next recession, now is the time to take action. The steps to sound personal finance decisions are much more simple than you realize. The hard part is actually executing your plan and sticking with it, especially when there\u2019s so many distractions in our everyday lives.\nTo begin, you need to know what your financials goals are and why they are important. The key here is to write them down and re-evaluate them periodically as you solidify your financial footing. If you have a spouse, you\u2019ll want to go through this exercise together.\nFor some families, their goals might include paying down credit card debt so they no longer have it looming over them, while for others it may be increasing their 401(k) contributions. You\u2019ll decide what makes the most sense for you and your loved ones.\nPROMOTED\nFocus On Financial Literacy First\nOnce you know the specific targets you want to reach, you\u2019ll need to become financially literate. The internet has more than enough information to get you started. If you feel stuck and aren\u2019t sure where to start, I run a personal finance site called The Finance Twins, which is full of free introductory personal finance materials and tools.\nUnderstand The Difference Between Assets And Liabilities\nAll purchases are not created equal. If you\u2019re focused on building wealth and securing your financial future, you\u2019ll want to maximize assets that hold and potentially grow in value, while limiting liabilities or financial obligations.\nOne common fallacy you\u2019ll want to be aware of is that purchasing a vehicle is smart financial decision since it is an asset. While technically true that your car is an asset from an accounting standpoint, your auto is a depreciating asset and quickly loses its value. Focus instead on investments and savings as true appreciating assets.\nYour Money Is Important, So You Need To Treat It That Way\nYou would never start a project or a cross-country road trip without a plan. Yet, so many people manage their money by crossing their fingers and hoping for the best.\nYou\u2019ll want to develop a plan to save, budget and invest your money. Focus on your savings rate, or the amount of money you are able to save from every paycheck. A rough guideline that you\u2019ll want to aim for is to invest 15% of your income for the future. A Traditional or Roth IRA is a good place to start if you are already taking advantage of a workplace retirement plan.\nRemember, getting your spending in check isn\u2019t an exercise in how much pain you can tolerate to pinch a few pennies. It\u2019s about designing a life and standard of living that is sustainable and still provides you with the same amount of happiness and pleasure, while allowing you to save and invest for your future.\nAsk For Advice If You Feel Stuck\nIf you\u2019ve gone a few weeks with a toothache that won\u2019t go away, chances are that you\u2019ll eventually find yourself staring at a bright light at the dentist's office. However, when your finances are hurting, you probably aren\u2019t running to a financial advisor or financial planner for help.\nIt\u2019s true that you might not get the same immediate gratification from visiting a financial planner because it takes time and effort to notice a difference in your financial life, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less important. After all, you\u2019ll be glad that you\u2019ll have the money to afford a visit to the dentist if you need one.\nNot all financial advisors are created equal so take the time to find someone you life and trust. You\u2019ll be glad you took the time to shop around and didn\u2019t go with the first person you met with, unless they are the right fit.\nLeverage Technology To Stay Financially Focused\nThere are countless apps and websites related to tracking your spending, managing your money, or setting up a budget. Take advantage of your favorite ones to stay on track with your goals. There are even Instagram accounts dedicated to inspiring positive financial decisions. An extra five minutes everyday looking at your financial situation instead of looking at pictures of cats on your newsfeed will go a long way.\nSimilarly, research has shown that small nudges can make a large difference in influencing your behavior, so it will help you if you go on this journey with a couple of friends. Something as simple as a friend texting you in the morning asking about your side hustle, might be all you need to actually go out and earn some extra money.\nDevelop An Investor Mindset\nIf your goal is to have financial freedom, then you need to start acting like it and have an investor-like mindset. You need to approach your everyday financial decisions with your goals in mind. Start by paying your future self first as soon as you get your paycheck. Don\u2019t just save whatever is left over. Your savings rate will tell you how you are doing. If you aren\u2019t earning enough money to reach your goals, you need to find ways to make more money.\nThe cost of living has increased faster than wages have over the past few decades, which means it\u2019s harder than ever to live a comfortable life. But it\u2019s still possible.\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before the next recession hits, but you\u2019ll be glad you made the decision to set a solid financial foundation for your family.",

(AP Photo/Robert F.... [+]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A Connecticut judge has thrown out a closely watched lawsuit against Remington Outdoor over the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, saying the plaintiffs failed to maneuver around a federal law prohibiting lawsuits against gun manufacturers over crimes committed with their products.</p>\n<p>In <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:http://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/DocumentInquiry/DocumentInquiry.aspx?DocumentNo=11214676\" href=\"http://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/DocumentInquiry/DocumentInquiry.aspx?DocumentNo=11214676\">a 54-page ruling</a>, Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis ticked through the various ways plaintiff lawyers tried to make a case against Remington, which made the Bushmaster rifle Adam Lanza used to kill 26 children and teachers on Dec. 14, 2012. All failed to fit the exceptions Congress wrote into the law, including one for &quot;negligent entrustment,&quot; or knowingly transferring a weapon to someone who will use it to commit a crime.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff lawyers representing the families of Sandy Hook victims argued this was a &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; case where the &ldquo;entrustment&rdquo; was to the public at large, and the public was incapable of handling the military-style weapon Adam Lanza used. They also sued the distributor that bought the gun at wholesale from Remington and the retailer who sold the gun to Lanza's mother Nancy, a licensed gun owner whom Lanza killed before moving on to a nearby elementary school.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To extend the theory of negligent entrustment to the class of nonmilitary, nonpolice citizens &ndash; the general public &ndash; would imply that the general public lacks the ordinary prudence necessary to handle an object that Congress regards as appropriate for sale to the general public,&rdquo; Bellis wrote. &ldquo;This the court is unwilling to do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Attorney <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:http://www.koskoff.com/Lawyers-Staff/Joshua-Koskoff.shtml\" href=\"http://www.koskoff.com/Lawyers-Staff/Joshua-Koskoff.shtml\">Joshua Koskoff</a> of Koskoff &amp; Bieder vowed to appeal the dismissal.</p>\n<p>&quot;While the families are obviously disappointed with the judge&rsquo;s decision, this is not the end of the fight,&quot; he said in a prepared statement. &quot;We will appeal this decision immediately and continue our work to help prevent the next Sandy Hook from happening.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The judge did agree with the plaintiffs, over Remington&rsquo;s objections, that the manufacturer qualified as a &ldquo;seller&rdquo; under the PLCAA subject to the negligent entrustment exception. But the judge rejected the plaintiffs' argument that Remington could be said to have entrusted the weapon to someone who used it in a criminal manner.</p>\n<p>Examining legislative history, the judge found that dissenting members of Congress tried to broaden the definition of negligent entrustment to include a series of transactions that place a gun in a criminal's hands, but failed. Cognizant of massacres like Columbine, she wrote, Congress limited negligent entrustment to the direct transfer of a weapon to a shooter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Based on the clear intent of Congress to narrowly define the `negligent entrustment&rsquo; exception, Adam Lanza&rsquo;s use of the firearm is the only actionable use,&rdquo; she wrote. Therefore none of the people the defendants actually entrusted the gun to &ldquo;used&rdquo; it to commit a crime.</p>\n<p>The judge also rejected the plaintiffs&rsquo; attempt to slip their claims in under Connecticut&rsquo;s consumer protection law, saying that law is limited to lawsuits where the plaintiff had some business relationship with the defendant.</p>\n<p>And she rejected their product-liability claims, because the gun most definitely worked as intended.</p>\n<p>The dismissal puts an end to an innovative attempt to get around the PLCAA, which Congress passed to thwart lawsuits against gun manufacturers over the crimes committed with their products. Judge Bellis allowed the case to proceed longer than might have been expected, given the clear conflict with the PLCAA, and <a data-ga-track=\"InternalLink:http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2016/06/20/judge-struggles-for-way-to-keep-sandy-hook-lawsuit-alive/\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2016/06/20/judge-struggles-for-way-to-keep-sandy-hook-lawsuit-alive/\">even mused that there might be a comparison to cigarette litigation </a>at a June hearing on Remington's motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>Remington is owned by Freedom Group, a unit of Cerberus Capital.</p>",

                "text": "A Connecticut judge has thrown out a closely watched lawsuit against Remington Outdoor over the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, saying the plaintiffs failed to maneuver around a federal law prohibiting lawsuits against gun manufacturers over crimes committed with their products.\nIn a 54-page ruling, Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis ticked through the various ways plaintiff lawyers tried to make a case against Remington, which made the Bushmaster rifle Adam Lanza used to kill 26 children and teachers on Dec. 14, 2012. All failed to fit the exceptions Congress wrote into the law, including one for \"negligent entrustment,\" or knowingly transferring a weapon to someone who will use it to commit a crime.\nPlaintiff lawyers representing the families of Sandy Hook victims argued this was a \u201ctop-down\u201d case where the \u201centrustment\u201d was to the public at large, and the public was incapable of handling the military-style weapon Adam Lanza used. They also sued the distributor that bought the gun at wholesale from Remington and the retailer who sold the gun to Lanza's mother Nancy, a licensed gun owner whom Lanza killed before moving on to a nearby elementary school.\n\u201cTo extend the theory of negligent entrustment to the class of nonmilitary, nonpolice citizens \u2013 the general public \u2013 would imply that the general public lacks the ordinary prudence necessary to handle an object that Congress regards as appropriate for sale to the general public,\u201d Bellis wrote. \u201cThis the court is unwilling to do.\u201d\nAttorney Joshua Koskoff of Koskoff & Bieder vowed to appeal the dismissal.\n\"While the families are obviously disappointed with the judge\u2019s decision, this is not the end of the fight,\" he said in a prepared statement. \"We will appeal this decision immediately and continue our work to help prevent the next Sandy Hook from happening.\u201d\nThe judge did agree with the plaintiffs, over Remington\u2019s objections, that the manufacturer qualified as a \u201cseller\u201d under the PLCAA subject to the negligent entrustment exception. But the judge rejected the plaintiffs' argument that Remington could be said to have entrusted the weapon to someone who used it in a criminal manner.\nExamining legislative history, the judge found that dissenting members of Congress tried to broaden the definition of negligent entrustment to include a series of transactions that place a gun in a criminal's hands, but failed. Cognizant of massacres like Columbine, she wrote, Congress limited negligent entrustment to the direct transfer of a weapon to a shooter.\n\u201cBased on the clear intent of Congress to narrowly define the `negligent entrustment\u2019 exception, Adam Lanza\u2019s use of the firearm is the only actionable use,\u201d she wrote. Therefore none of the people the defendants actually entrusted the gun to \u201cused\u201d it to commit a crime.\nThe judge also rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to slip their claims in under Connecticut\u2019s consumer protection law, saying that law is limited to lawsuits where the plaintiff had some business relationship with the defendant.\nAnd she rejected their product-liability claims, because the gun most definitely worked as intended.\nThe dismissal puts an end to an innovative attempt to get around the PLCAA, which Congress passed to thwart lawsuits against gun manufacturers over the crimes committed with their products. Judge Bellis allowed the case to proceed longer than might have been expected, given the clear conflict with the PLCAA, and even mused that there might be a comparison to cigarette litigation at a June hearing on Remington's motion to dismiss.\nRemington is owned by Freedom Group, a unit of Cerberus Capital.",

That warning may seem irrelevant to you since Internet Explorer was officially discontinued in 2015. It's now an archaic web browser, only in use by about 7% of Windows users. But if take into account the total market share of Windows 7 and Windows 10, the legacy web browser is installed on more than 1 billion computers. Why does this matter? Because the flaw that's been discovered can be exploited even if you never intentionally use Internet Explorer.\nYikes.\nAs Page explains (via ZDNet), the vulnerability taps into a file extension known as .MHT, which is a format used by Internet Explorer to handle archived web pages. If you were to launch Internet Explorer and save a web page, this is one of the file extensions that could be used.\nAnd if someone were to send you a malicious .MHT file (perhaps disguised as a download link or an email attachment), Internet Explorer would be the default application to open it.\nAccording to Page, once a user opens this malicious .MHT file, the specific flaw in the code relies on the user to first issue certain keystrokes first, such as CTRL+K (to duplicate a tab) or various Print commands. At that point, an external attacker can \"exfiltrate local files and conduct remote reconnaissance.\"\nThat already sounds scary, but then Page says that a simple javascript call within the file (such as invoking the Print Preview function) can do this automatically and without user interaction.\nAnd if that isn't enough, Page drops this bomb:\n\"Typically, when instantiating ActiveX Objects [...] users will get a security warning bar in IE and be prompted to activate blocked content.

                "text": "In the aftermath of two crashes of Boeing's 737 MAX that resulted in the deaths of more than 300 people, the plane maker's engineering choices\u2014namely the decision to fit a larger engine onto an aircraft design that dates back to the 1960s\u2014have come under scrutiny.\nWhen the 737-100 debuted in 1968, it was designed to be low to the ground to ease boarding by ladder. As Boeing has stretched its bestselling plane over the years to fit more passengers and the bypass fans on jet engines have gotten bigger to drive more air, Boeing has had to come up with creative solutions on successive models to make the engines fit under the wings.\nThe engine on the 737-300, which debuted in 1984, was put in a housing with a flattened lower lip that was likened to a hamster mouth, with accessories like the generators and fuel pumps moved to the sides, making pouchlike bulges.\nOn the 737 MAX, which debuted in 2017, the engines were placed higher up on the wings and further forward. Boeing discovered that their greater size and position gave the plane\u2019s nose a tendency to tilt upward in certain high-speed maneuvers, running the risk that it could lose lift. To counter that, Boeing added a flight control program called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, which automatically pushes the nose down when the plane is being flown by hand and the angle at which it\u2019s flying is close to allowing an aerodynamic stall.\nIt\u2019s suspected that a faulty angle-of-attack sensor led the MCAS to engage on Lion Air Flight 610, which plunged into the sea off Indonesia shortly after takeoff on October 29, killing all 186 on board. The similarities between that accident and Sunday\u2019s crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane that killed 157 have led regulators around the world to ground the 737 MAX while investigators work to determine the cause.\nAt the beginning of this decade, Boeing was considering replacing the 737 with an all-new airplane, envisioning a lighter-weight, elliptical composite fuselage, an advanced electrical system and, of course, easy clearance to fit a larger, more efficient engine.\nBut new plane designs inherently carry more risk.\nWhile new aircraft are rigorously tested and inspected to gain certification, problems often arise after they enter into service, both mechanical and in pilots\u2019 understanding of them. An Airbus A320 famously crashed during a demonstration flight at an airshow in France in 1988, in part because the captain misunderstood the flight control logic.\n\u201cIf you\u2019d done a new, clean-sheet-of-paper design, you might have introduced more risk into the system,\u201d says R. John Hansman, an aeronautics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nThe lithium-ion battery fires that led to a three-month grounding of the Boeing 787 in 2013 emerged out of an attempt to transition to a radically new electric architecture. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t clear they could find a solution in a reasonable amount of time,\u201d says Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with Teal Group.\nBy comparison, the MCAS problem looks simpler, although the consequences have been infinitely more serious. Boeing is working on a software patch and enhancements to the angle-of-attack sensor inputs that, combined with training changes, are expected to solve the problem, experts say, assuming the two crash investigations don't uncover other issues.\nThe 737 is the bestselling airliner of all time, with over 10,000 produced. Consequently, the basic design and many of the systems onboard are well-proven. The repositioning of the engine on the new version is not an overreach, says Hansman. \u201cThe stability augmentation should work, and once they get the software patch it will work fine, I think.\u201d\nThere are business pressures on manufacturers to keep updating an old design, too.

A game theory modeling analysis conducted by James K.D. Morrison, a graduate student of Hansman\u2019s, backs up Boeing\u2019s thinking.\n\u201cEven though you would get more performance with a new design, you\u2019d end up losing, because for that ten years your competitor would be selling airplanes,\u201d says Hansman. \u201cFrom a business standpoint, I don\u2019t think Boeing had much option.\u201d",

After all, the over-payment of taxes has the effect of giving the government a tax-free loan.</p>\n<p>So when should you expect your tax refund, especially if it's particularly large?</p>\n<p>The answer is <em>it depends.</em></p>\n<p>But the good news is refunds are going out much more quickly now with e-filing and direct deposits. The IRS issued refunds to more than nine out of 10 taxpayers in less than 21 days last year.</p>\n<p>The entire process is happening much more quickly all the time. For example, while the IRS normally says to wait 24 to 48 hours for your return to be accepted by the agency after e-filing, a confirmation of acceptance often comes in less than an hour. The whole process seems to have accelerated.</p>\n<h2>Factors that Affect the Speed of Your Tax Refund</h2>\n<p>The IRS doesn't put out a specific schedule detailing exactly when taxpayers can expect their refunds. But there are general guidelines that can offer a clue.</p>\n<p>PROMOTED</p>\n<p>For example, we know <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://thecollegeinvestor.com/840/when-to-expect-my-tax-refund/\" href=\"https://thecollegeinvestor.com/840/when-to-expect-my-tax-refund/\">when you receive your tax refund depends</a> largely on two major factors:</p>\n<ol> <li>how you file your return (e-file or paper file), and</li> <li>how you set up your refund (direct deposit or paper check).</li> </ol>\n<p>Taking those variables into account, refunds are generally expected to be received within the following timelines:</p>\n<ul> <li>E-file with direct deposit, 1 &ndash; 3 weeks</li> <li>E-file with paper check refund, 4 weeks</li> <li>Paper file with direct deposit, 6 - 8 weeks</li> <li>Paper file with paper check refund, up to 8 weeks</li> </ul>\n<p>It's important to understand these timelines are estimates only. For example, if you e-file with direct deposit, the IRS generally says you'll receive your refund in about two weeks. But many taxpayers receive theirs in just one week.</p>\n<p>There are also certain factors that can make it take a little bit longer. For example, certain tax credits, like the earned income tax credit and <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://www.goodfinancialcents.com/child-tax-credit/\" href=\"https://www.goodfinancialcents.com/child-tax-credit/\">the additional child tax credit</a> can delay a refund.</p>\n<p>Another variable is filing early. Early in January the IRS confirmed it would <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-confirms-tax-filing-season-to-begin-january-28\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-confirms-tax-filing-season-to-begin-january-28\">begin processing returns on January 28</a>. The technically speaking, you can file your return any time after January 1. There's been a trend of people filing early in January when they expect large refunds. Various tax preparation services have been promoting the practice.</p>\n<p>But if you filed your tax return on January 5, it wasn't going to be processed for another 23 days. Most likely, the clock on your refund began running on January 28, which may have pushed your refund into the middle of February even if you e-file for direct deposit.</p>\n<h2>When You Should Expect Your Tax Refund</h2>\n<p>Based on the variables above, you can expect your tax refund to arrive within the time frames in the table below. The table starts on January 28, since that's when the IRS began processing returns.</p>\n<table> <tbody> <tr> <td><b>Filing Date / Filing Method</b></td> <td><b>E-file with direct deposit refund</b></td> <td><b>E-file with paper check refund</b></td> <td><b>Paper file with direct deposit refund</b></td> <td><b>Paper file with paper check refund</b></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>January 28</b></td> <td>Feb. 4 &ndash; Feb. 18</td> <td>Feb. 25</td> <td>March 11 &ndash; March 25</td> <td>March 25</td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>February 1</b></td> <td>Feb. 8 &ndash; Feb. 22</td> <td>March 1</td> <td>March 15 &ndash; March 29</td> <td>March 29</td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>February 15</b></td> <td>Feb. 22 &ndash; March 8</td> <td>March 15</td> <td>March 29 &ndash; April 12</td> <td>April 12</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>\n<p>Tax refunds may occur after the dates listed in the table as the April 15 due date approaches. Filing traffic is usually heaviest in late March and early April, and even right up to the deadline. This is most likely because taxpayers who owe will prefer to wait as long as possible, slowing the refund process as they do.</p>\n<h2>Tracking Your Refund</h2>\n<p>If you're not content to simply wait for your return, you always have the option to track its progress directly with the IRS. You can do this through the <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://www.irs.gov/refunds\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/refunds\">Where&rsquo;s My Refund Tool</a>.</p>\n<p>You'll have to wait at least 24 hours after e-filing your return to begin tracking your refund. But in another example of how e-filing is the superior strategy, <em>you'll need to wait four weeks to begin tracking it if you mail in your return.</em></p>\n<p>To begin tracking your refund, you'll need to enter your Social Security number, filing status (single, head of household, married filing jointly, etc.), and the exact amount of your expected refund.</p>\n<p>If you're anxious, and want to stay on top of the process on a day-to-day basis, the IRS even offers its mobile app, <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs2goapp\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs2goapp\">IRS2Go</a>. It can be downloaded for free at Google Play, the App Store, and Amazon.com, for iOS (9.0 or later) and Android (4.0 and up) devices.</p>\n<p>The IRS recommends calling to follow up only if it's been more than 21 days since you e-filed your return, or six weeks since mailing your return.</p>\n<h2>Factors that can Slow Your Refund</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/dam/imageserve/ad9842f8065b464cafb71d81446491ce/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\"></img><figcaption>Tax refund ASSOCIATED PRESS</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Before filing your return, be sure to check carefully for errors. Even minor ones can delay your refund. A good strategy is to prepare your tax return, then let it sit for a couple of days.</p>\n<p>When doing your review, do it with the assumption there may be errors. Check all entries against the source documents, and make sure they're all an exact match.</p>\n<p>Factors that can delay your refund include:</p>\n<ul> <li>An error in your Social Security number, even if it's only by one digit.</li> <li>An incomplete or incorrect address.</li> <li>Incorrect income or withholding numbers.</li> <li>Incomplete information, such as not providing your children&rsquo;s Social Security numbers.</li> <li>Math errors (though these are unlikely with tax preparation software).</li> <li>Entering incorrect or incomplete direct deposit information.</li> </ul>\n<p>If you <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://www.goodfinancialcents.com/best-tax-software-programs/\" href=\"https://www.goodfinancialcents.com/best-tax-software-programs/\">prepare your return with tax software</a>, most of these errors will be caught by the program. Generally speaking, your e-file attempt will be rejected if your return is found to be either incomplete or contain incorrect information. You&rsquo;ll be forced to make the corrections before even filing.</p>\n<h2>A Common Problem with 2018 Refunds: Owing or Getting a Smaller Refund</h2>\n<p>The IRS is already reporting a decline in the number of people receiving tax refunds in 2019 compared to 2018. According to <a data-ga-track=\"InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrae/2019/02/22/tax-refund/#468b82765445\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrae/2019/02/22/tax-refund/#468b82765445\">Forbes contributor, David Rae</a>, other taxpayers are seeing smaller refunds than they expected to get. &quot;For those of you who did not adjust your tax withholdings (estimated taxes taken out your paycheck),&quot; said David, &quot;you could end up with a much smaller tax refund compared to previous years. Some of you may even end owing more taxes when you file.&quot;</p>\n<p>The new tax law brought certain significant changes to the tax code. One of the biggest is changes in major tax deductions. Perhaps the most significant has to do with the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), which are now capped at $10,000. Prior to 2018, there was no limit on SALT deductions. This is just one example. The net result is either a lower tax refund, or even an unexpected tax liability.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in that situation for your 2018 return, the good news is you can make adjustments in 2019 that will eliminate a repeat when you file your return next year. You can either increase your withholding taxes, or, if you're self-employed, increase your tax estimates. A small increase in either can get you back to the kind of tax refunds you've come to expect.</p>",

After all, the over-payment of taxes has the effect of giving the government a tax-free loan.\nSo when should you expect your tax refund, especially if it's particularly large?\nThe answer is it depends.\nBut the good news is refunds are going out much more quickly now with e-filing and direct deposits. The IRS issued refunds to more than nine out of 10 taxpayers in less than 21 days last year.\nThe entire process is happening much more quickly all the time. For example, while the IRS normally says to wait 24 to 48 hours for your return to be accepted by the agency after e-filing, a confirmation of acceptance often comes in less than an hour. The whole process seems to have accelerated.\nFactors that Affect the Speed of Your Tax Refund\nThe IRS doesn't put out a specific schedule detailing exactly when taxpayers can expect their refunds. But there are general guidelines that can offer a clue.\nPROMOTED\nFor example, we know when you receive your tax refund depends largely on two major factors:\nhow you file your return (e-file or paper file), and\nhow you set up your refund (direct deposit or paper check).\nTaking those variables into account, refunds are generally expected to be received within the following timelines:\nE-file with direct deposit, 1 \u2013 3 weeks\nE-file with paper check refund, 4 weeks\nPaper file with direct deposit, 6 - 8 weeks\nPaper file with paper check refund, up to 8 weeks\nIt's important to understand these timelines are estimates only. For example, if you e-file with direct deposit, the IRS generally says you'll receive your refund in about two weeks. But many taxpayers receive theirs in just one week.\nThere are also certain factors that can make it take a little bit longer. For example, certain tax credits, like the earned income tax credit and the additional child tax credit can delay a refund.\nAnother variable is filing early.

                "html": "<p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s presidency has been so widely derided in the national media that a casual observer might easily conclude his prospects for reelection are dim. However, that is not what the odds makers are saying. They give Trump a solid edge over any Democratic candidate in 2020.</p>\n<p>The odds makers are right. Trump will probably be reelected if he chooses to run. What follows is an explanation of why the odds favor Trump, and what eight years of his leadership would mean for global security. Let&rsquo;s start with the factors favoring a second term.</p>\n<p>First of all, candidates who get elected to the presidency once tend to get reelected if they run. Only two chief executives seeking reelection over the last 50 years&mdash;Carter and Bush 41&mdash;failed in their bid for a second term. Nixon, Reagan, Clinton, Bush 43 and Obama all won reelection, even though at least two of them were highly controversial. In fact, the most controversial presidents tend to roll up the biggest reelection victories.</p>\n<p>Second, Trump has presided over the strongest economy in living memory. Unemployment is at record lows, inflation is nearly non-existent, and new jobs are being created at a startling pace. Anyone who studies presidential politics knows that strong economies are the most important factor driving support for the incumbent.

Critics complain he is too eager to get out of places like Afghanistan and Syria, however the record shows that voters have little patience for foreign military intervention.

Trump is a masterful speaker when he campaigns, he has delivered on many of his promises to key constituencies, etc. The point is that, Robert Mueller and Kamala Harris notwithstanding, President Trump is probably going to be reelected. So what does that mean for global security?</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to answer that question precisely without knowing which party will control Congress or what our various overseas partners and adversaries might do in the future. However, there is one critical consequence for global security that you can take to the bank if he wins reelection. The world order that America fashioned in the years after World War Two&mdash;the 40 years now known as the Cold War&mdash;will be finally and definitively done for.</p>\n<p>That global order was grounded in three fundamental precepts: support for democratic principles, collective security against Russian aggression, and liberalization of international trade. Now every one of those precepts is at risk due to President Trump&rsquo;s nationalistic, transactional approach to his job. In Trump&rsquo;s view, many of the ties that America has to other nations are left over from another time, and have become a pretext for draining the nation&rsquo;s treasury. He wants to stop subsidizing the security of nations that are not paying their fair share, and focus more on looking out for America&rsquo;s economy the same way every other nation does.</p>\n<p>This is not the crazy idea that many of his critics allege. The United States began the new millennium generating nearly a third of global GDP, and a decade later that share had fallen to less than a quarter. The biggest cause of the decline was China&rsquo;s relentless mercantilism after joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the failure of successive U.S. administrations to insist Beijing live up to its commitments. Similarly, the U.S. spends 4% of its GDP on defense in part because Germany&mdash;the linchpin of NATO&mdash;spends only 1%.</p>\n<p>The most persistent thrust in President Trump&rsquo;s policymaking during his two years in office is that Washington is done dealing with overseas partners who don&rsquo;t contribute to the security and prosperity of America. The president&rsquo;s efforts to change the disastrous global status quo he believes he inherited have had wrenching effects, but he deeply believes in what he is doing, so he will keep doing it.</p>\n<p>What that means is that at the end of eight years, the framework of institutions we have come to associate with the postwar world order will have withered. NATO will be increasingly fragile because most of its members won&rsquo;t begin to match the commitment of military resources Trump is demanding. The free trade regime fashioned under the WTO will have given way to managed trade that better supports U.S. economic aspirations. And having a democratic government will no longer be the price of admission to close relations with Washington. Donald Trump is a change agent in ways that even many of his supporters don&rsquo;t fully grasp, and a second term would bring his most cherished goals close to fruition.</p>",

                "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has been so widely derided in the national media that a casual observer might easily conclude his prospects for reelection are dim. However, that is not what the odds makers are saying. They give Trump a solid edge over any Democratic candidate in 2020.\nThe odds makers are right. Trump will probably be reelected if he chooses to run. What follows is an explanation of why the odds favor Trump, and what eight years of his leadership would mean for global security. Let\u2019s start with the factors favoring a second term.\nFirst of all, candidates who get elected to the presidency once tend to get reelected if they run. Only two chief executives seeking reelection over the last 50 years\u2014Carter and Bush 41\u2014failed in their bid for a second term. Nixon, Reagan, Clinton, Bush 43 and Obama all won reelection, even though at least two of them were highly controversial. In fact, the most controversial presidents tend to roll up the biggest reelection victories.\nSecond, Trump has presided over the strongest economy in living memory. Unemployment is at record lows, inflation is nearly non-existent, and new jobs are being created at a startling pace. Anyone who studies presidential politics knows that strong economies are the most important factor driving support for the incumbent. While growth may moderate between now and election day, few economists expect a recession anytime soon.\nThird, the nation is at peace. Trump has avoided involvement in new overseas adventures, and is pressing to scale back what is left of the operations he inherited from his predecessor. Critics complain he is too eager to get out of places like Afghanistan and Syria, however the record shows that voters have little patience for foreign military intervention. Unpopular wars are the one issue that can eclipse a good economy in the minds of voters, but at the moment Trump seems to be delivering both peace and prosperity.\nFourth, Democrats are busy reminding voters in the middle of the political spectrum why they voted for Trump in 2016. Ever since the Democrats drifted away from their blue-collar base in the 1970s, winning the party\u2019s presidential nomination has required appeals to the Left. While many voters may resent the rich and want more government benefits, those sentiments become muted when the economy is strong. Having given more voters a stake in the economic status quo, Trump can count on an electoral backlash against controversial measures advocated by Democratic presidential candidates in the primaries.\nFifth, polls showing weak approval of the president\u2019s performance have lulled Democrats into thinking his defeat is nearly inevitable in 2020. But Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were both unpopular during their first terms, and then went on to score landslide victories against opponents who made the incumbent look good. Surveys indicating that a majority of voters aren\u2019t inclined to vote for Trump again are misleading, because we don\u2019t know who his Democratic rival will be in 2020. That will be a decisive factor drawing voters to the polls\u2014as often as not because they are so eager to cast their ballots against a contender they detest.\nSixth, people have gotten used to Trump. He doesn\u2019t seem as outrageous as he once did. His critics will fret that this amounts to \u201cnormalizing deviance,\u201d but what it really shows is that two years in the nation\u2019s top job have taken the edge off of Trump\u2019s confrontational personality.

The world order that America fashioned in the years after World War Two\u2014the 40 years now known as the Cold War\u2014will be finally and definitively done for.\nThat global order was grounded in three fundamental precepts: support for democratic principles, collective security against Russian aggression, and liberalization of international trade. Now every one of those precepts is at risk due to President Trump\u2019s nationalistic, transactional approach to his job. In Trump\u2019s view, many of the ties that America has to other nations are left over from another time, and have become a pretext for draining the nation\u2019s treasury.

The</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The U.S. government has disclosed more of its case against WikiLeaks cofounder Julian Assange. It hinges on a claim he and Chelsea Manning worked together to crack a password for a computer storing sensitive government files.</p>\n<p>An <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5913205-Assange-Affidavit.html\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5913205-Assange-Affidavit.html\">affidavit</a> unsealed Monday outlining the case against Assange said he conspired with Manning when they discussed working together to crack a password &ldquo;related to two computers with access to classified national security information.&rdquo; More specifically, the password belonged to a user called FTP (not to be confused with an FTP server) on two Windows computers that Manning could access from a base in Iraq, the government said.</p>\n<p>The FTP account wasn&rsquo;t associated with any specific individual, and the government alleged that if Manning had used it to pilfer files and hand them over to Wikileaks, she could have foiled investigators looking into who was behind the leaks. &ldquo;Although there is no evidence that the password to the FTP user was obtained, had Manning done so, she would have been able to take steps to procure classified information under a username that did not belong to her,&rdquo; the affidavit read. &ldquo;Such measures would have frustrated attempts to identify the source of the disclosures to WikiLeaks.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The alleged conspiracy to crack the password took place in March 2010, two months after Maning had walked out of the Iraq base with classified war reports from Iraq and Afghanistan. She was later convicted and served seven years in jail for downloading tens of thousands U.S. military documents and diplomatic cables.</p>\n<p><strong>How passwords are cracked</strong></p>\n<p>The reason any password had to be cracked in the first place was the use of what&rsquo;s known as a &ldquo;hash.&rdquo; Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows operating system doesn&rsquo;t store passwords in plain text. That&rsquo;s to prevent hackers who find a way on to the computer from seeing and stealing them. Instead, Microsoft makes life harder for cybercriminals and snoops by turning that plain text into scrambled code. That string of letters and numbers is known as a &ldquo;hash value,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s created when an algorithm is applied to the plain text of the password.</p>\n<p>For an attacker to get at the plain text it&rsquo;s possible to do a so-called &ldquo;brute force attack.&rdquo; The process for this is basic: The hacker creates a huge list of guessed passwords through the same hashing algorithm used by Windows to find a matched hash value for the hidden password. Once the same hash value is calculated, the password has been found. Sometimes a password will be too complex for guessing to work in a short enough time frame. That&rsquo;s where &ldquo;rainbow tables&rdquo; come in. These contain a massive number of hash values for previously calculated passwords. Hackers use them to do a quick comparison of the hash they have with the ones in the table, in the hopes that it&rsquo;s already been seen before and a match is available.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In computing terms we call this a time/memory trade-off. Rather than spend time on a task, we precalculate parts of it and store them somewhere, essentially trading time for memory,&rdquo; says Tom Wyatt, senior penetration tester at cybersecurity provider Bulletproof. &ldquo;These tables can be calculated or downloaded from various online sources, and it simply boils down to paying for storage for it all; even in 2010 this was fairly cheap and entirely possible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Microsoft goes one step further in protecting those hash values by splitting them in two, storing the parts in separate files. Here&rsquo;s where a little trick comes in handy: A hacker might be able to recover those two separate pieces by rebooting a Windows PC using a CD with the Linux operating system.

                "text": "The U.S. government has disclosed more of its case against WikiLeaks cofounder Julian Assange. It hinges on a claim he and Chelsea Manning worked together to crack a password for a computer storing sensitive government files.\nAn affidavit unsealed Monday outlining the case against Assange said he conspired with Manning when they discussed working together to crack a password \u201crelated to two computers with access to classified national security information.\u201d More specifically, the password belonged to a user called FTP (not to be confused with an FTP server) on two Windows computers that Manning could access from a base in Iraq, the government said.\nThe FTP account wasn\u2019t associated with any specific individual, and the government alleged that if Manning had used it to pilfer files and hand them over to Wikileaks, she could have foiled investigators looking into who was behind the leaks. \u201cAlthough there is no evidence that the password to the FTP user was obtained, had Manning done so, she would have been able to take steps to procure classified information under a username that did not belong to her,\u201d the affidavit read. \u201cSuch measures would have frustrated attempts to identify the source of the disclosures to WikiLeaks.\u201d\nThe alleged conspiracy to crack the password took place in March 2010, two months after Maning had walked out of the Iraq base with classified war reports from Iraq and Afghanistan. She was later convicted and served seven years in jail for downloading tens of thousands U.S. military documents and diplomatic cables.\nHow passwords are cracked\nThe reason any password had to be cracked in the first place was the use of what\u2019s known as a \u201chash.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system doesn\u2019t store passwords in plain text. That\u2019s to prevent hackers who find a way on to the computer from seeing and stealing them. Instead, Microsoft makes life harder for cybercriminals and snoops by turning that plain text into scrambled code. That string of letters and numbers is known as a \u201chash value,\u201d and it\u2019s created when an algorithm is applied to the plain text of the password.\nFor an attacker to get at the plain text it\u2019s possible to do a so-called \u201cbrute force attack.\u201d The process for this is basic: The hacker creates a huge list of guessed passwords through the same hashing algorithm used by Windows to find a matched hash value for the hidden password. Once the same hash value is calculated, the password has been found. Sometimes a password will be too complex for guessing to work in a short enough time frame. That\u2019s where \u201crainbow tables\u201d come in. These contain a massive number of hash values for previously calculated passwords. Hackers use them to do a quick comparison of the hash they have with the ones in the table, in the hopes that it\u2019s already been seen before and a match is available.\n\u201cIn computing terms we call this a time/memory trade-off. Rather than spend time on a task, we precalculate parts of it and store them somewhere, essentially trading time for memory,\u201d says Tom Wyatt, senior penetration tester at cybersecurity provider Bulletproof. \u201cThese tables can be calculated or downloaded from various online sources, and it simply boils down to paying for storage for it all; even in 2010 this was fairly cheap and entirely possible.\u201d\nBut Microsoft goes one step further in protecting those hash values by splitting them in two, storing the parts in separate files. Here\u2019s where a little trick comes in handy: A hacker might be able to recover those two separate pieces by rebooting a Windows PC using a CD with the Linux operating system. Back in 2010, it was possible to do that and recover the full hash value.\nKen Munro, a penetration tester with Pen Test Partners, told Forbes the technique still works, as long as there\u2019s no additional layer of security over it, such as full disc encryption. \u201cWhilst the technique still works, it\u2019s quite rare to find systems that don\u2019t now have full disc or similar encryption,\u201d he added. (Microsoft hadn\u2019t responded to a request for comment at the time of publication). According to the government\u2019s telling of the story, evidence suggests Manning tried, and very possibly failed, with this technique. In a footnote in the affidavit, the government said Manning hadn\u2019t provided Assange with the full hash, only one of the two halves required.\nIt\u2019s alleged Manning passed what she thought was a hash value to Assange. The Wikileaks chief then said he would pass it on to a specialist in cracking, according to chats over the Jabber encrypted communications app, as provided in the affidavit. But as per the investigators\u2019 claims, there was some confusion: Manning said she wasn\u2019t even sure what she handed to Assange was the hash value they wanted. Assange messaged Manning to ask if there were \u201cany more hints\u201d about the hash and that he\u2019d had \u201cno luck so far,\u201d according to the government account. From there it\u2019s unclear what happened. The government admits it didn\u2019t know whether the password was ever cracked.\nNot that it changes much for Assange: The charge is that of conspiracy. If he did offer assistance to help Manning gain access to U.S. government systems and encouraged the then intelligence analyst to leak files, the charge still stands. Manning, who served seven years in jail before having her sentence commuted by President Barack Obama, is back behind bars for refusing to testify in the investigation into Wikileaks. Her lawyer had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.\nAssange\u2019s lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment at the time of publication. She told Sky News yesterday that the indictment against her client showed \u201cthe kinds of communications journalists have with sources all the time.\u201d Following Assange\u2019s arrest, however, various journalists have said on Twitter that any incitement to hack organizations or steal documents was far from normal and risked breaking the law.\nMeanwhile, the fallout from Assange\u2019s arrest continues. According to Reuters, Ecuador\u2019s telecommunications vice minister Patricio Real said the government\u2019s networks had been hit by a mass of cyberattacks after it decided to revoke Assange\u2019s asylum status. He claimed various government websites had been slammed by 40 million hacking attempts per day, double the number it typically sees.",

It turns out the Amazon effect is on a relatively small scale compared to the overall Kohl&rsquo;s business.</p>\n<p>The same goes for some of the other initiatives Kohl&rsquo;s has been working on, including sublets to Aldi and Planet Fitness.</p>\n<p>Consider:</p>\n<p>&bull; Yes, Kohl&rsquo;s is now accepting free returns of merchandise purchased on Amazon. Consumers can bring them back to a Kohl&rsquo;s store, with a receipt, and get a refund. According to a store employee when asked about the program, if customers don&rsquo;t have a receipt they get the credit at Kohl&rsquo;s, not Amazon.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a smart tie-in and obviously drives foot traffic to Kohl&rsquo;s locations. One published report says the number of people walking into an Amazon-program store averaged 13.5% higher than conventional stores. That&rsquo;s impressive.</p>\n<p>But do the math: Kohl&rsquo;s has about 1,100 stores but this program is only available in less than 10% of them, or about 100 stores. The program is reportedly only being tested in California and Chicago locations, and there is no timetable from Kohl&rsquo;s management when it might be expanded to the other more than 1,000 stores.</p>\n<p>&bull; Selected Kohl&rsquo;s stores are also selling Amazon-branded products, notably Alexa voice devices and Kindle readers. Again, these are very popular products and provide Kohl&rsquo;s stores with a serious merchandising point of differentiation.</p>\n<p>But this program is only in about 200 stores, about 17% of the company&rsquo;s total footprint. That&rsquo;s good for those stores, but it still means there are more than 900 Kohl&rsquo;s stores that don&rsquo;t sell Amazon products.</p>\n<p>&bull; People also point to Kohl&rsquo;s subleasing strategy, another smart move on its part to repurpose space vacated by downsized stores. Macy&rsquo;s is doing the same thing by moving in Backstage departments into its existing stores while Sears has been leasing out lots of its former selling space in its race to retail irrelevancy.</p>\n<p>The Aldi partnership is right, bringing in high frequency shoppers to its real estate, even if the two stores operate independently and aren&rsquo;t internally connected.</p>\n<p>But again, this program is in its infancy. Kohl&rsquo;s management has talked about testing the concept in five or ten locations and one published report earlier this month said there was only one actual Aldi up and running in former Kohl&rsquo;s space.</p>\n<p>To have any real impact on Kohl&rsquo;s business there will literally need to be dozens&mdash;maybe hundreds&mdash;of Aldi subleases in place and that&rsquo;s nowhere in sight.</p>\n<p>&bull; The same for the company&rsquo;s just announced tie-in with Planet Fitness to open ten gyms this year in Kohl&rsquo;s space.

                "text": "Kohl\u2019s has become the retail poster child of late\u2014the company everyone mentions when they want to talk about a legacy retailer that is successfully adapting to a radically reordered marketplace.\nAnd given all the turmoil in the industry, particularly on the physical store side of the business, Kohl\u2019s indeed does stand out as a retailer that is doing a lot of the right things.\nBut when pundits and analysts alike make the case that it\u2019s the store\u2019s tie-in with Amazon that\u2019s making all the difference, perhaps they need to take a remedial math class. It turns out the Amazon effect is on a relatively small scale compared to the overall Kohl\u2019s business.\nThe same goes for some of the other initiatives Kohl\u2019s has been working on, including sublets to Aldi and Planet Fitness.\nConsider:\n\u2022 Yes, Kohl\u2019s is now accepting free returns of merchandise purchased on Amazon. Consumers can bring them back to a Kohl\u2019s store, with a receipt, and get a refund. According to a store employee when asked about the program, if customers don\u2019t have a receipt they get the credit at Kohl\u2019s, not Amazon.\nIt\u2019s a smart tie-in and obviously drives foot traffic to Kohl\u2019s locations. One published report says the number of people walking into an Amazon-program store averaged 13.5% higher than conventional stores. That\u2019s impressive.\nBut do the math: Kohl\u2019s has about 1,100 stores but this program is only available in less than 10% of them, or about 100 stores. The program is reportedly only being tested in California and Chicago locations, and there is no timetable from Kohl\u2019s management when it might be expanded to the other more than 1,000 stores.\n\u2022 Selected Kohl\u2019s stores are also selling Amazon-branded products, notably Alexa voice devices and Kindle readers. Again, these are very popular products and provide Kohl\u2019s stores with a serious merchandising point of differentiation.\nBut this program is only in about 200 stores, about 17% of the company\u2019s total footprint. That\u2019s good for those stores, but it still means there are more than 900 Kohl\u2019s stores that don\u2019t sell Amazon products.\n\u2022 People also point to Kohl\u2019s subleasing strategy, another smart move on its part to repurpose space vacated by downsized stores. Macy\u2019s is doing the same thing by moving in Backstage departments into its existing stores while Sears has been leasing out lots of its former selling space in its race to retail irrelevancy.\nThe Aldi partnership is right, bringing in high frequency shoppers to its real estate, even if the two stores operate independently and aren\u2019t internally connected.\nBut again, this program is in its infancy. Kohl\u2019s management has talked about testing the concept in five or ten locations and one published report earlier this month said there was only one actual Aldi up and running in former Kohl\u2019s space.\nTo have any real impact on Kohl\u2019s business there will literally need to be dozens\u2014maybe hundreds\u2014of Aldi subleases in place and that\u2019s nowhere in sight.\n\u2022 The same for the company\u2019s just announced tie-in with Planet Fitness to open ten gyms this year in Kohl\u2019s space. Again, another traffic driver\u2014and the right traffic, younger shoppers who are hard to get into legacy retailing spaces.\nBut its impact on the store\u2019s financial performance will be minimal at best at this level. Tests are great yet they don\u2019t really prove their worth until they are ramped up chain-wide and that day is way, way off on all of these things.\nTaken all together these are smart moves on the part of Kohl\u2019s management and they are to be applauded. But in attributing the company\u2019s positive numbers to them, well, the fact is that they are collectively just too small to really move the needle.\nMichelle Gass, Kohl\u2019s CEO, says all of these things are part of a bigger picture. \u201cThe big idea is that this is teaching us to think differently,\u201d she was recently quoted as saying, channeling her inner Steve Jobs perhaps.\nNevertheless the retailer is looking at things in ways its counterparts aren\u2019t. It recently signed a deal with WW, the company previously known as Weight Watchers, for a line of home-related merchandise. Having Oprah Winfrey\u2014a shareholder and the current public face for WW\u2014out there working your brand is not a bad thing.\nKohl\u2019s has also brought in other brands, including Under Armour, to strengthen its product mix, and this has been something it has done consistently throughout its history.\nInside its stores, Kohl\u2019s is doing many other things right. Stores have electronic pricing signs that allow for dynamic price tags, something very few other retailers have been rolling out to any degree.
