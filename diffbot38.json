                "text": "Weather contributed to the deaths of hundreds of people in the United States last year, but you might be surprised by the three types of events that caused the largest number of fatalities.\nFlooding killed 80 people last year, the second most of any category in NOAA's report. That's near the long-term average of 87 flooding deaths per year, however, it's also the first time since 2014 the toll has been less than 115 for a single year.\nAbout 25 percent of the flooding fatalities in 2018 were from Hurricane Florence (16) and Hurricane Michael (5).\nRip currents may not come to mind as a major weather-related killer, but in the last two years, they have been an underrated danger. They were blamed for 71 deaths and 70 deaths on our nation's coastlines in 2018 and 2017, respectively. That ranks them as the third deadliest weather-related event in the U.S. for both years in NOAA's database.\nHigh winds from thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm events last year claimed 58 lives, the fourth most of any category. Winds can be deadly when they topple trees onto buildings and vehicles.\nThe death toll from lightning and tornadoes was far below the long-term average.\nTornadoes killed 10 people in 2018, the fewest on record in that category. Lightning contributed to 20 deaths last year, which is about half the 30-year average of 43.\nWeather contributes to many deaths in vehicle accidents each year. Those are not all included in NOAA's statistics.\n(MORE: Weather-Related Accidents More Deadly Than Tornadoes)",

Another 54 people remain missing, the Associated Press reports.</p>\n<p>&quot;The rescue process will not be easy as they're under the mud, not just ordinary soil. It is really difficult to get the bodies back,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>Mud that flowed from a nearby lake on Monday triggered the collapse of a mound of discarded earth that covered not only the workers, but also mining equipment.</p>\n<p>Tin Soe noted that the missing are buried under up to 100 feet of mud.</p>\n<p>&quot;There is no machine to pump out the mud,&quot; he told the AP. &quot;It could cost millions of dollars.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>(MORE: </strong><a href=\"https://weather.com/news/news/2019-04-23-south-africa-flash-flooding-mudslides-impacts\"><strong>South Africa Flash Flooding Kills 23, Injures Dozens More; Hundreds Evacuated</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>According to reports, many of the <a href=\"https://www.pennews.net/international/2019/04/23/myanmar-landslide-90-dead-at-kachin-jade-mine\">missing are scavengers</a> who were searching the waste dump for pieces of jade when the landslide occurred, PenNews reported.</p>\n<p>The region is the hub of the world's biggest and most lucrative jade mining industry, AP reported. In November 2015, more than 100 scavengers looking for jade in the mounds of discarded earth were killed in a similar slide.</p>\n<p>The profitability of the jade industry has led to regulatory neglect by businesses and the government.</p>\n<p>&quot;Many jade mining companies do not follow rules and regulations on where or how to dump waste piles,&quot; Maw Htun Awng, a mining governance researcher, told the AP after an accident last year killed at least 15. &quot;Then there are no actual mechanisms to watch if these companies are following these rules and that's why this is part of the cumulative impact.&quot;</p>\n<p>A similar incident occurred in March, resulting in damage to equipment but no deaths.</p>\n<p>The Weather Company&rsquo;s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

Another 54 people remain missing, the Associated Press reports.\n\"The rescue process will not be easy as they're under the mud, not just ordinary soil. It is really difficult to get the bodies back,\" he said.\nMud that flowed from a nearby lake on Monday triggered the collapse of a mound of discarded earth that covered not only the workers, but also mining equipment.\nTin Soe noted that the missing are buried under up to 100 feet of mud.\n\"There is no machine to pump out the mud,\" he told the AP. \"It could cost millions of dollars.\"\n(MORE: South Africa Flash Flooding Kills 23, Injures Dozens More; Hundreds Evacuated)\nAccording to reports, many of the missing are scavengers who were searching the waste dump for pieces of jade when the landslide occurred, PenNews reported.\nThe region is the hub of the world's biggest and most lucrative jade mining industry, AP reported. In November 2015, more than 100 scavengers looking for jade in the mounds of discarded earth were killed in a similar slide.\nThe profitability of the jade industry has led to regulatory neglect by businesses and the government.\n\"Many jade mining companies do not follow rules and regulations on where or how to dump waste piles,\" Maw Htun Awng, a mining governance researcher, told the AP after an accident last year killed at least 15. \"Then there are no actual mechanisms to watch if these companies are following these rules and that's why this is part of the cumulative impact.\"\nA similar incident occurred in March, resulting in damage to equipment but no deaths.\nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

The projections were based on the 2019 U.N. Climate Report.\nA year ago, the water level in one drought-plagued section of the Rio Grande river was at its lowest level ever recorded. A significant fact, considering the U.S. Geologic Survey started keeping records more than a century ago.\nNow, federal water managers in New Mexico say, parts of the river have done a \"complete turnaround\" from last year, thanks to a very wet winter across much of the western U.S.\nOfficials with the Bureau of Reclamation and other federal, state and local water agencies met last week in Albuquerque to discuss forecasts, predictions about how much water will be released from the river's reservoirs this year, the Associated Press reported.\nTheir assessment? Things are looking up, at least for now.\n\"This is a complete turnaround from last year when we were preparing for drying in the middle Rio Grande in April,\" Jennifer Faler, who manages the Bureau of Reclamation's Albuquerque office, told the AP.\n(MORE: America's 10 Most Endangered Rivers for 2019)\nThis year's flow forecast for April predicts flows into the El Vado Reservoir, in northern New Mexico, will be 142% of average. That's up from just 18% last year, according to the AP report.\nSimilar increases are also expected in other parts of the river that flow through the state.\nLast year, one water gauge in the Rio Grande in northern New Mexico recorded the driest conditions since measurements began 130 years ago, Mark Gunn, a hydrologist with the USGS, told CBS News.\n\"Since we've been measuring since 1889, last year was the lowest discharge \u2026 in the history of this gauge,\" Gunn said.\nScientists and environmentalists concerned about extreme drought and climate change have been ringing alarm bells for years about the state of the Rio Grande River, one of the longest and most well-known waterways in the United States.\nThe river winds its way nearly 1,900 miles from the peaks of the southern Rocky Mountains in Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico in Texas. It\u2019s perhaps best known as the border between Mexico and Texas, but the Rio Grande provides drinking water for more than six million people, as well as important irrigation water, wildlife habitats and recreation areas.\nThe Rio Grande drainage basin in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico had some of the worst drought conditions in the U.S. last year, according to weather.com meteorologist Christopher Dolce. But those drought conditions significantly improved - and even disappeared in some areas - thanks to an active and wet winter weather pattern.\nSeveral storms over the past two months brought rain or snow to the southern Rockies, which feeds the Rio Grande. Snowpack from the region will also continue to melt throughout the spring, bringing more water to the river.\n\"Long-term weather patterns will dictate how long this break from severe drought will last, but for now, the area is in much better shape than it was last spring at this time,\" Dolce said.\nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

The drugs were seen as a safer alternative to tranquilizers, which were the standard treatment for depression until that time. Despite being weaker than old-style tricyclic antidepressants, they grew in popularity because it was believed they restored serotonin levels back to normal, <em>&ldquo;a notion that later transmuted into the idea that they remedied a chemical imbalance,&rdquo;</em> said David Healy, head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatric unit in Bangor, North Wales.</p>\n<p>Healy wrote in a report published in the journal BMJ that in the 1990s, no one knew if SSRIs raised or lowered serotonin levels, but there was no evidence that the treatment worked as a treatment at all. The drugs have fewer side effects than their predecessors, and are safer in overdose, which contributed to their popularity.</p>\n<p><a data-delivery=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=kx%2FR7ouWJ5sxO4iYfHVzwEgynTVIfGq69Ajd3w%2FvttFyEIZ8dMy0QYNF3MMw9LhH27sULpEHk8QoeTIqyEPaPHXLLcIIbzJOrdi3jA7MZaCTKHi2xhdx4Yefmofr5cwNR76fkcxFlGVe1kaSuYmm6YxRr%2BHPPYxBXwGcEOqXUNXZw%2FagSrxXRzU9Bl0Cux7Ed%2B%2F5%2FeOWPAPexN59GNH7bd1y2WEi1cCdwLTWr1dxJy%2Bzq0ElaJOkcZXB7hY0D4E8%2B2YVDGQ7gdQdstx4%2BHobbTzri7NVgZ73e0VTuadCHlWKv277k3UOD5Qi7H4qDmHlKJHoagu1BXihcCXbxUlGEh0Q5x1NJVu0TLWEc4QKfUIyTFWmD4L0jNgFPaZIZjQzoR74AboKq5HO8kzCVgqCjDCG85Bd0mhpeUs%2BO8xOgo3opVmh%2B4OkixRkQ0UJ7FICcaiG%2F7eUaNWd2jkzkWFcKGtgLknvhGd8DgdG%2B768haEIpKMT%2FzQNalouGyczN4xcM2LXVYpHTZ7NiAiEKrIEyxhBWX7NRBaSnHJbKCSy0CQ%2F%2Ba1aUPf7GVkWKD607CyTJcVLFQVYu5IdRzU7smxM8Y8xrhHIdvVdJsx77hu8pofF0hoAzF6DjKVlCf3auOOr1O6nOEenRQef2yag2aL3uLjJnS6USExtPujIwWL8RWV9%2Be1DaNayWULU5sFTvvCqLYgoMsMWv2OOOPjaWbSqeZMJReVYF9sTCC7FjFfErD5i2Ah6Fon2abXWQM8dAR%2BjPKOTUihNHiH0i7BuxWkpzIrYFw4bzMfltRlmlzYDniZ58v533Zd1cRdFQE8ZrIfCncTF11kD4WYlMqIMeO22oSFW77kHRiAsSppR6U1CvaxFVPUIVWrM7FBCHmaBSjkjAIjfB5QJM46Y7SXP%2FEZ%2FE95FXIwjjAUkB9u2V30jATnK%2B4k16wTkvp52TaEuUH9SBTGAL0%2BUEJzaYndUWb3pok0i58VuoFzKIxB7TvA2Fpg%3D&s2s=1\" data-id=\"kx%2FR7ouWJ5sxO4iYfHVzwEgynTVIfGq69Ajd3w%2FvttFyEIZ8dMy0QYNF3MMw9LhH27sULpEHk8QoeTIqyEPaPHXLLcIIbzJOrdi3jA7MZaCTKHi2xhdx4Yefmofr5cwNR76fkcxFlGVe1kaSuYmm6YxRr%2BHPPYxBXwGcEOqXUNXZw%2FagSrxXRzU9Bl0Cux7Ed%2B%2F5%2FeOWPAPexN59GNH7bd1y2WEi1cCdwLTWr1dxJy%2Bzq0ElaJOkcZXB7hY0D4E8%2B2YVDGQ7gdQdstx4%2BHobbTzri7NVgZ73e0VTuadCHlWKv277k3UOD5Qi7H4qDmHlKJHoagu1BXihcCXbxUlGEh0Q5x1NJVu0TLWEc4QKfUIyTFWmD4L0jNgFPaZIZjQzoR74AboKq5HO8kzCVgqCjDCG85Bd0mhpeUs%2BO8xOgo3opVmh%2B4OkixRkQ0UJ7FICcaiG%2F7eUaNWd2jkzkWFcKGtgLknvhGd8DgdG%2B768haEIpKMT%2FzQNalouGyczN4xcM2LXVYpHTZ7NiAiEKrIEyxhBWX7NRBaSnHJbKCSy0CQ%2F%2Ba1aUPf7GVkWKD607CyTJcVLFQVYu5IdRzU7smxM8Y8xrhHIdvVdJsx77hu8pofF0hoAzF6DjKVlCf3auOOr1O6nOEenRQef2yag2aL3uLjJnS6USExtPujIwWL8RWV9%2Be1DaNayWULU5sFTvvCqLYgoMsMWv2OOOPjaWbSqeZMJReVYF9sTCC7FjFfErD5i2Ah6Fon2abXWQM8dAR%2BjPKOTUihNHiH0i7BuxWkpzIrYFw4bzMfltRlmlzYDniZ58v533Zd1cRdFQE8ZrIfCncTF11kD4WYlMqIMeO22oSFW77kHRiAsSppR6U1CvaxFVPUIVWrM7FBCHmaBSjkjAIjfB5QJM46Y7SXP%2FEZ%2FE95FXIwjjAUkB9u2V30jATnK%2B4k16wTkvp52TaEuUH9SBTGAL0%2BUEJzaYndUWb3pok0i58VuoFzKIxB7TvA2Fpg%3D\" data-target=\"https://pro.oxfordclub.com/m/1356476?rev_campaign_id=613580\" href=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=kx%2FR7ouWJ5sxO4iYfHVzwEgynTVIfGq69Ajd3w%2FvttFyEIZ8dMy0QYNF3MMw9LhH27sULpEHk8QoeTIqyEPaPHXLLcIIbzJOrdi3jA7MZaCTKHi2xhdx4Yefmofr5cwNR76fkcxFlGVe1kaSuYmm6YxRr%2BHPPYxBXwGcEOqXUNXZw%2FagSrxXRzU9Bl0Cux7Ed%2B%2F5%2FeOWPAPexN59GNH7bd1y2WEi1cCdwLTWr1dxJy%2Bzq0ElaJOkcZXB7hY0D4E8%2B2YVDGQ7gdQdstx4%2BHobbTzri7NVgZ73e0VTuadCHlWKv277k3UOD5Qi7H4qDmHlKJHoagu1BXihcCXbxUlGEh0Q5x1NJVu0TLWEc4QKfUIyTFWmD4L0jNgFPaZIZjQzoR74AboKq5HO8kzCVgqCjDCG85Bd0mhpeUs%2BO8xOgo3opVmh%2B4OkixRkQ0UJ7FICcaiG%2F7eUaNWd2jkzkWFcKGtgLknvhGd8DgdG%2B768haEIpKMT%2FzQNalouGyczN4xcM2LXVYpHTZ7NiAiEKrIEyxhBWX7NRBaSnHJbKCSy0CQ%2F%2Ba1aUPf7GVkWKD607CyTJcVLFQVYu5IdRzU7smxM8Y8xrhHIdvVdJsx77hu8pofF0hoAzF6DjKVlCf3auOOr1O6nOEenRQef2yag2aL3uLjJnS6USExtPujIwWL8RWV9%2Be1DaNayWULU5sFTvvCqLYgoMsMWv2OOOPjaWbSqeZMJReVYF9sTCC7FjFfErD5i2Ah6Fon2abXWQM8dAR%2BjPKOTUihNHiH0i7BuxWkpzIrYFw4bzMfltRlmlzYDniZ58v533Zd1cRdFQE8ZrIfCncTF11kD4WYlMqIMeO22oSFW77kHRiAsSppR6U1CvaxFVPUIVWrM7FBCHmaBSjkjAIjfB5QJM46Y7SXP%2FEZ%2FE95FXIwjjAUkB9u2V30jATnK%2B4k16wTkvp52TaEuUH9SBTGAL0%2BUEJzaYndUWb3pok0i58VuoFzKIxB7TvA2Fpg%3D&s2s=1\"><figure><video src=\"https://videos.revcontent.com/revcontent/video/upload/c_pad,h_240,w_426,b_blurred:400,f_mp4/v1579628040/revcontent-p0/cr_videos/9597/4213758.mp4\"> </video></figure></a></p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;For doctors it provided an easy short hand for communication with patients,&rdquo;</em> Healy wrote. <em>&lsquo;For patients, the idea of correcting an abnormality has a moral force that can be expected to overcome the scruples some might have had about taking a tranquilliser, especially when packaged in the appealing form that distress is not a weakness.&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p>Healy says depression should be reclassified as an infectious disease rather than an emotional disorder, and the professor is not alone in his thinking. Dr. Turhan Canli of Stony Brook University in New York believes depression could be caused by a parasitic, bacterial, or viral infection and argues in favor of further research to test his hypothesis. If this is the case, Canli says scientists could develop a vaccine to protect against depression (a solution we aren&rsquo;t sure is the right one).</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Instead of conceptualising major depression as an emotional disorder, I suggest to re-conceptualise it as some form of an infectious disease,&rdquo;</em> Canli wrote in the journal Biology of Mood and Anxiety Disorders. <em>&ldquo;I propose that future research should conduct a concerted search for parasites, bacteria, or viruses that may play a causal role in the etiology of major depression.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Top mental health professionals have always known that depression <a href=\"http://naturalsociety.com/depression-chemical-imbalance-doesnt-exist/\">might not be caused by serotonin levels</a> alone, but the public never got the memo. Professor Sir Simon Wessely, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says that SSRIs are indeed helpful in the treatment of depression when combined with psychological treatments, but added that <em>&ldquo;most researchers have long since moved on from the old serotonin model.&rdquo;</em> Further, reports say that 70% of <a href=\"http://naturalsociety.com/study-70-of-people-on-antidepressants-dont-have-depression/\">people on antidepressants don&rsquo;t have depression</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Professor David Taylor, Director of Pharmacy and Pathology and Head of Pharmaceutical Sciences Clinical Academic Group, King&rsquo;s Health Partners, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3050380/Depression-NOT-caused-low-serotonin-levels-drugs-used-treat-based-myth-psychiatrist-claims.html\">said</a>:</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;&lsquo;Professor Healy makes a forceful but poorly supported argument against something which doesn&rsquo;t and has never really existed: the idea that SSRIs &lsquo;correct&rsquo; an &lsquo;imbalance&rsquo; of serotonin in the brain.&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p><em>Researchers and psychiatrists alike know that SSRIs are effective in a number of disorders but no one is sure exactly how they work. Their readily demonstrable effect is on serotonin but they have many indirect secondary effects in the brain.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, <strong>explained</strong> in a New York Times book review exactly <strong>how this theory was set afloat:</strong></p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;When it was found that psychoactive drugs affect neurotransmitter levels in the brain, as evidenced mainly by the levels of their breakdown products in the spinal fluid, the theory arose that the cause of mental illness is an abnormality in the brain&rsquo;s concentration of these chemicals that is specifically countered by the appropriate drug </em></p>\n<p><em>That was a great leap in logic &hellip; It was entirely possible that drugs that affected neurotransmitter levels could relieve symptoms even if neurotransmitters had nothing to do with the illness in the first place (and even possible that they relieved symptoms through some other mode of action entirely).&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p><strong>With this logic, Angell writes, you <em>&ldquo;could argue that fevers are caused by too little aspirin!&rdquo;</em></strong></p>\n<p>Healy warns that regardless of what actually causes depression, the drugs used to &ldquo;treat&rdquo; the illness are not improving. In fact, in some cases, the safety and efficacy of new drugs is declining.</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;In other areas of life the products we use, from computers to microwaves, improve year on year, but this is not the case for medicines, where this year&rsquo;s treatments may achieve blockbuster sales despite being less effective and less safe than yesterday&rsquo;s models,&rdquo;</em> Healy writes.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Not only may antidepressants not attack the root cause of depression, but they could also be dangerously and permanently altering brain function.</em> </strong>According to Mercola, patients are recovering from depression faster, but are relapsing more, or only partially recovering and existing in a state of chronic depression that never goes away.</p>\n<p>Only about 15% of clinically depressed people that are treated with an antidepressant go into remission and stay well for a long period of time. The other 85% begin suffering continuing relapses and become chronically depressed.</p>\n<p><strong>Medical journalist and Pulitzer Prize nominee</strong> <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/09/13/the-epidemic-of-mental-illness--why.aspx\">Robert Whitaker told Mercola</a>:</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;By the 1990s, this change in the long term course of depression was so pronounced that finally it was addressed by researchers,&rdquo;</em> says Whitaker. &ldquo;Giovanni Fava from Italy said, <em>&ldquo;Hey, listen, the course is changing with antidepressants. We&rsquo;re changing it from an episodic illness to a chronic illness, and we really need to address this.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p><em>Not only that, but the depression is sinking into people [on antidepressants] in a deeper way than before.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>This is likely because psychotropic drugs can actually interfere with neurotransmitters, upsetting the delicate processes within the brain that are vital to maintaining normal biological functions, resulting in side effects that actually mimic mental illness.</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;After several weeks on psychoactive drugs, the brain&rsquo;s compensatory efforts begin to fail, and side effects emerge that reflect the mechanism of action of the drugs. For example, the SSRIs may cause episodes of mania, because of the excess of serotonin. Antipsychotics cause side effects that resemble Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, because of the depletion of dopamine (which is also depleted in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease).</em></p>\n<p><em>As side effects emerge, they are often treated by other drugs, and many patients end up on a cocktail of psychoactive drugs prescribed for a cocktail of diagnoses.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>source:</p>\n<p>naturalsociety.com</p>",

                "text": "For years we\u2019ve been told that depression is caused by low serotonin levels in the brain. Now, a leading professor of psychiatry is warning that belief is little more than a dangerous miscommunication, saying the marketing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs is \u201cbased on a myth.\u201d\nSSRI use began to skyrocket in the early 1990\u2019s. The drugs were seen as a safer alternative to tranquilizers, which were the standard treatment for depression until that time. Despite being weaker than old-style tricyclic antidepressants, they grew in popularity because it was believed they restored serotonin levels back to normal, \u201ca notion that later transmuted into the idea that they remedied a chemical imbalance,\u201d said David Healy, head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatric unit in Bangor, North Wales.\nHealy wrote in a report published in the journal BMJ that in the 1990s, no one knew if SSRIs raised or lowered serotonin levels, but there was no evidence that the treatment worked as a treatment at all. The drugs have fewer side effects than their predecessors, and are safer in overdose, which contributed to their popularity.\n\u201cFor doctors it provided an easy short hand for communication with patients,\u201d Healy wrote. \u2018For patients, the idea of correcting an abnormality has a moral force that can be expected to overcome the scruples some might have had about taking a tranquilliser, especially when packaged in the appealing form that distress is not a weakness.\u2019\nHealy says depression should be reclassified as an infectious disease rather than an emotional disorder, and the professor is not alone in his thinking. Dr. Turhan Canli of Stony Brook University in New York believes depression could be caused by a parasitic, bacterial, or viral infection and argues in favor of further research to test his hypothesis. If this is the case, Canli says scientists could develop a vaccine to protect against depression (a solution we aren\u2019t sure is the right one).\n\u201cInstead of conceptualising major depression as an emotional disorder, I suggest to re-conceptualise it as some form of an infectious disease,\u201d Canli wrote in the journal Biology of Mood and Anxiety Disorders. \u201cI propose that future research should conduct a concerted search for parasites, bacteria, or viruses that may play a causal role in the etiology of major depression.\u201d\nTop mental health professionals have always known that depression might not be caused by serotonin levels alone, but the public never got the memo. Professor Sir Simon Wessely, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says that SSRIs are indeed helpful in the treatment of depression when combined with psychological treatments, but added that \u201cmost researchers have long since moved on from the old serotonin model.\u201d Further, reports say that 70% of people on antidepressants don\u2019t have depression.\nProfessor David Taylor, Director of Pharmacy and Pathology and Head of Pharmaceutical Sciences Clinical Academic Group, King\u2019s Health Partners, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said:\n\u201c\u2018Professor Healy makes a forceful but poorly supported argument against something which doesn\u2019t and has never really existed: the idea that SSRIs \u2018correct\u2019 an \u2018imbalance\u2019 of serotonin in the brain.\u2019\nResearchers and psychiatrists alike know that SSRIs are effective in a number of disorders but no one is sure exactly how they work. Their readily demonstrable effect is on serotonin but they have many indirect secondary effects in the brain.\u201d\nMarcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, explained in a New York Times book review exactly how this theory was set afloat:\n\u201cWhen it was found that psychoactive drugs affect neurotransmitter levels in the brain, as evidenced mainly by the levels of their breakdown products in the spinal fluid, the theory arose that the cause of mental illness is an abnormality in the brain\u2019s concentration of these chemicals that is specifically countered by the appropriate drug\nThat was a great leap in logic \u2026 It was entirely possible that drugs that affected neurotransmitter levels could relieve symptoms even if neurotransmitters had nothing to do with the illness in the first place (and even possible that they relieved symptoms through some other mode of action entirely).\u201d\nWith this logic, Angell writes, you \u201ccould argue that fevers are caused by too little aspirin!\u201d\nHealy warns that regardless of what actually causes depression, the drugs used to \u201ctreat\u201d the illness are not improving. In fact, in some cases, the safety and efficacy of new drugs is declining.\n\u201cIn other areas of life the products we use, from computers to microwaves, improve year on year, but this is not the case for medicines, where this year\u2019s treatments may achieve blockbuster sales despite being less effective and less safe than yesterday\u2019s models,\u201d Healy writes.\nNot only may antidepressants not attack the root cause of depression, but they could also be dangerously and permanently altering brain function. According to Mercola, patients are recovering from depression faster, but are relapsing more, or only partially recovering and existing in a state of chronic depression that never goes away.\nOnly about 15% of clinically depressed people that are treated with an antidepressant go into remission and stay well for a long period of time. The other 85% begin suffering continuing relapses and become chronically depressed.\nMedical journalist and Pulitzer Prize nominee Robert Whitaker told Mercola:\n\u201cBy the 1990s, this change in the long term course of depression was so pronounced that finally it was addressed by researchers,\u201d says Whitaker. \u201cGiovanni Fava from Italy said, \u201cHey, listen, the course is changing with antidepressants. We\u2019re changing it from an episodic illness to a chronic illness, and we really need to address this.\u201d\nNot only that, but the depression is sinking into people [on antidepressants] in a deeper way than before.\u201d\nThis is likely because psychotropic drugs can actually interfere with neurotransmitters, upsetting the delicate processes within the brain that are vital to maintaining normal biological functions, resulting in side effects that actually mimic mental illness.\n\u201cAfter several weeks on psychoactive drugs, the brain\u2019s compensatory efforts begin to fail, and side effects emerge that reflect the mechanism of action of the drugs. For example, the SSRIs may cause episodes of mania, because of the excess of serotonin. Antipsychotics cause side effects that resemble Parkinson\u2019s disease, because of the depletion of dopamine (which is also depleted in Parkinson\u2019s disease).\nAs side effects emerge, they are often treated by other drugs, and many patients end up on a cocktail of psychoactive drugs prescribed for a cocktail of diagnoses.\u201d\nsource:\nnaturalsociety.com",

We know that without it we are not getting on that plane. Once we have boarded, many of us become more careless about it&rsquo;s whereabouts, because we are done with it. Sometimes we slip it in the seat pocket in front of us, stick it in a magazine, or just chuck it.</p>\n<p>Until watching this video I never realized that my carelessness with the boarding pass had the potential to land me in a ton of trouble! Evidently there is personal information frequently encrypted on the pass, according to &lsquo;Krebs on Security&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>All that an unscrupulous person has to do is get a screen shot of the bar code on the boarding pass, and feed it into a bar code reader on &ldquo;Inlite&rsquo;s&rdquo; site. It was pointed out by a forensic expert for CBS, Winston Krone, that it is possible for the encrypted information on the bar code to contain personal email addresses, home addresses and phone numbers. Access to personal financial information is just a step away. Please watch the footage below to help insure the safety of your personal information.

Once we have boarded, many of us become more careless about it\u2019s whereabouts, because we are done with it. Sometimes we slip it in the seat pocket in front of us, stick it in a magazine, or just chuck it.\nUntil watching this video I never realized that my carelessness with the boarding pass had the potential to land me in a ton of trouble! Evidently there is personal information frequently encrypted on the pass, according to \u2018Krebs on Security\u201d.\nAll that an unscrupulous person has to do is get a screen shot of the bar code on the boarding pass, and feed it into a bar code reader on \u201cInlite\u2019s\u201d site. It was pointed out by a forensic expert for CBS, Winston Krone, that it is possible for the encrypted information on the bar code to contain personal email addresses, home addresses and phone numbers. Access to personal financial information is just a step away. Please watch the footage below to help insure the safety of your personal information. I never would have dreamed that being careless with my boarding pass could lead to such potential damage.\nPlease SHARE this alarming and important safety information with your friends and family on Facebook",

The scientific duo stated in the Icarus Journal that:</p>\n<p>Once fixed, the code might stay unchanged over cosmological timescales. In fact, it is the most durable construct known. Therefore it represents an exceptionally reliable storage for an intelligent signature. Once the genome is appropriately rewritten, the new code with a signature will stay frozen in the cell and its progeny, which might then be delivered through space and time.</p>\n<p>In other words, the human DNA is designed with such a precision that it reveals an &ldquo;ensemble of arithmetical and ideographical patterns of symbolic language&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>As a result of this study, other researchers now discuss the probability of us humans being engineered outside of our solar system by our alien creators several billion years ago, a hypothesis strongly supported by the many ancient texts found on Earth that speak of the creation of mankind and the creator gods or deities.</p>\n<p>However, the study also focuses on the idea that life on Earth emerged as a result of microbiological particles being carried throughout the cosmos on asteroids and comets, which behave as giant transportation devices that plant life on different planets capable of sustaining it. This theory differs from the classic evolution theory, as its supporters believe that we were not a random product of evolution, but a certain creation of our makers, designed and sent to Earth on purpose.</p>\n<p>Cherbak and Makukov presented a detailed analysis of the human genome that shows a previously ignored precision-type method in the mapping between the DNA&rsquo;s nucleotides and amino acids. The duo stated that:</p>\n<p>Simple arrangements of the code reveal an ensemble of arithmetical and ideographical patterns of symbolic language. Accurate and systematic, these underlying patterns appear as a product of precision logic and nontrivial computing.</p>\n<p>So is it possible that we were designed by advanced alien beings with extended knowledge of creating life through DNA manipulation? If so, is the human species a product originating from another planet in this vast universe? Or is it rather a product designed on Earth by an advanced race who anchored on this planet in the ancient past, as many timeworn texts suggests?</p>\n<p>While we cannot deny the panspermia hypothesis claiming that life on the earth originated from microorganisms or chemical precursors of life present in outer space that were able to initiate life upon reaching a suitable environment, we find it likely that life on Earth is in fact a product of more intelligent species with the ability to create life.</p>\n<p>Whatever may be the case, the upcoming years will reveal more information regarding topics that were until now forbidden or ignored.</p>\n<p><a data-delivery=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=HSz64XDcOJs%2FpuRTdFWMg0kzcV83ehYUwzQe7Y0xBGbyxE1R5%2BYlBXPGALUYMr0s9NamWJ2qOL0K38IL7UZs%2Bb%2F7qdnVs3np9iGWquWQeOv%2FWRpS%2Bu53zsVlCCANqWH0XZEQHyhvUJ1MArs39CVcbbrJQFGPqA9ZZTiMJ8SXJlC0djiwRY%2FWf7xaji5puY3FhnMu0tIvrl4%2FTbGRHeFpXhwuOKkhSWHKLIMHeFLFTGERuEUdl9txgBSWzbehNeZcBd8B5Q42HfE0D4qi4vyqReN9ibfFfcfPlyXpOdt2h8R%2BG1n3z83uKn%2Bf591gyx%2FeDYIZ%2FbEtX7OXDzjYB8tebImik3Pshiest91eP%2BYvsz5dyXrbSofvPwKu19EdlLo%2FYIzGUCOKnOONrxUjpvv2I9Iy%2BIjDrnKbLP66pf0S0QrDsn78rfmR0cPw40QgxygV%2FIQDEkxZ4bgCqHnSLD0YtV%2B39UimWL8%2FP3Xr5Oct%2BtfbUOBfNY8L%2Bm1pc618dwbsyM6sgWgES7MrsJFiVSxYld%2B8%2BbjLlmMWYI4y%2FQdvKo6Vig4pUaVgruC1AEaiuLmL77hlSama3LSVBL82t3fANssv86YDtSMtwHBWobtgRVMmUnlSmOFOHKWm98fvHVHls9KYiVsSw%2FGHlFXy5fqwo3vehemR4XbXqsSLzvHdCMPwLw6oeLvzFsKJzLJVhXFm1Kvn%2Be313kbS0l990FnXw%2F7Du89HI4XqRyeruqcHp1EA%2FQV3miswm9zXqsbnOoLIBAX9%2B8ehVKykNadl1Lg7S7wLty1nNkbb%2FvRy9iLxqgeTL7WvsfTy9oo6t8hGtuxaW21MYMTK45m%2BL5vyrATpFE8gagv3jVLjBkoRBujqjB4T%2BB9UoaHtrON%2BIZU73Mn%2BtGXzsN5rAKHHaAr3uGc60BEAIb2WuNxF0XHz1igXhaTBWgA%2Bvxjkilj%2BQMU8O50T9IiYdb9GD6lEG7Fkjgf3tDnHm6muHbvm31hjhJf2ugA%3D&s2s=1\" data-id=\"HSz64XDcOJs%2FpuRTdFWMg0kzcV83ehYUwzQe7Y0xBGbyxE1R5%2BYlBXPGALUYMr0s9NamWJ2qOL0K38IL7UZs%2Bb%2F7qdnVs3np9iGWquWQeOv%2FWRpS%2Bu53zsVlCCANqWH0XZEQHyhvUJ1MArs39CVcbbrJQFGPqA9ZZTiMJ8SXJlC0djiwRY%2FWf7xaji5puY3FhnMu0tIvrl4%2FTbGRHeFpXhwuOKkhSWHKLIMHeFLFTGERuEUdl9txgBSWzbehNeZcBd8B5Q42HfE0D4qi4vyqReN9ibfFfcfPlyXpOdt2h8R%2BG1n3z83uKn%2Bf591gyx%2FeDYIZ%2FbEtX7OXDzjYB8tebImik3Pshiest91eP%2BYvsz5dyXrbSofvPwKu19EdlLo%2FYIzGUCOKnOONrxUjpvv2I9Iy%2BIjDrnKbLP66pf0S0QrDsn78rfmR0cPw40QgxygV%2FIQDEkxZ4bgCqHnSLD0YtV%2B39UimWL8%2FP3Xr5Oct%2BtfbUOBfNY8L%2Bm1pc618dwbsyM6sgWgES7MrsJFiVSxYld%2B8%2BbjLlmMWYI4y%2FQdvKo6Vig4pUaVgruC1AEaiuLmL77hlSama3LSVBL82t3fANssv86YDtSMtwHBWobtgRVMmUnlSmOFOHKWm98fvHVHls9KYiVsSw%2FGHlFXy5fqwo3vehemR4XbXqsSLzvHdCMPwLw6oeLvzFsKJzLJVhXFm1Kvn%2Be313kbS0l990FnXw%2F7Du89HI4XqRyeruqcHp1EA%2FQV3miswm9zXqsbnOoLIBAX9%2B8ehVKykNadl1Lg7S7wLty1nNkbb%2FvRy9iLxqgeTL7WvsfTy9oo6t8hGtuxaW21MYMTK45m%2BL5vyrATpFE8gagv3jVLjBkoRBujqjB4T%2BB9UoaHtrON%2BIZU73Mn%2BtGXzsN5rAKHHaAr3uGc60BEAIb2WuNxF0XHz1igXhaTBWgA%2Bvxjkilj%2BQMU8O50T9IiYdb9GD6lEG7Fkjgf3tDnHm6muHbvm31hjhJf2ugA%3D\" data-target=\"https://pro.oxfordclub.com/m/1356476?rev_campaign_id=613580\" href=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=HSz64XDcOJs%2FpuRTdFWMg0kzcV83ehYUwzQe7Y0xBGbyxE1R5%2BYlBXPGALUYMr0s9NamWJ2qOL0K38IL7UZs%2Bb%2F7qdnVs3np9iGWquWQeOv%2FWRpS%2Bu53zsVlCCANqWH0XZEQHyhvUJ1MArs39CVcbbrJQFGPqA9ZZTiMJ8SXJlC0djiwRY%2FWf7xaji5puY3FhnMu0tIvrl4%2FTbGRHeFpXhwuOKkhSWHKLIMHeFLFTGERuEUdl9txgBSWzbehNeZcBd8B5Q42HfE0D4qi4vyqReN9ibfFfcfPlyXpOdt2h8R%2BG1n3z83uKn%2Bf591gyx%2FeDYIZ%2FbEtX7OXDzjYB8tebImik3Pshiest91eP%2BYvsz5dyXrbSofvPwKu19EdlLo%2FYIzGUCOKnOONrxUjpvv2I9Iy%2BIjDrnKbLP66pf0S0QrDsn78rfmR0cPw40QgxygV%2FIQDEkxZ4bgCqHnSLD0YtV%2B39UimWL8%2FP3Xr5Oct%2BtfbUOBfNY8L%2Bm1pc618dwbsyM6sgWgES7MrsJFiVSxYld%2B8%2BbjLlmMWYI4y%2FQdvKo6Vig4pUaVgruC1AEaiuLmL77hlSama3LSVBL82t3fANssv86YDtSMtwHBWobtgRVMmUnlSmOFOHKWm98fvHVHls9KYiVsSw%2FGHlFXy5fqwo3vehemR4XbXqsSLzvHdCMPwLw6oeLvzFsKJzLJVhXFm1Kvn%2Be313kbS0l990FnXw%2F7Du89HI4XqRyeruqcHp1EA%2FQV3miswm9zXqsbnOoLIBAX9%2B8ehVKykNadl1Lg7S7wLty1nNkbb%2FvRy9iLxqgeTL7WvsfTy9oo6t8hGtuxaW21MYMTK45m%2BL5vyrATpFE8gagv3jVLjBkoRBujqjB4T%2BB9UoaHtrON%2BIZU73Mn%2BtGXzsN5rAKHHaAr3uGc60BEAIb2WuNxF0XHz1igXhaTBWgA%2Bvxjkilj%2BQMU8O50T9IiYdb9GD6lEG7Fkjgf3tDnHm6muHbvm31hjhJf2ugA%3D&s2s=1\"><figure><video src=\"https://videos.revcontent.com/revcontent/video/upload/b_blurred:400,c_pad,h_240,w_426/v1580306490/revcontent-p0/cr_videos/9597/4228275.mp4\"> </video></figure></a></p>",

                "text": "A new study reveals how the human DNA was encoded using an extraterrestrial signal used by ancient aliens who visited Earth in the distant past.\nThe study is called \u201cThe \u201cWow! Signal\u201d of the terrestrial genetic code\u201d, and it is the work of two researchers from the Department of Mathematics, respectively Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute, Almaty, Republic of Kazakhstan.\nThe two authors of the study, researchers Vladimir I. shCherbak and Maxim A. Makukov, trust in the existence of a \u201cBiological SETI\u201d \u2013 a mathematical code residing inside the human DNA, and is something that cannot be explained via the course of evolution as traditional theories claim.\nAccording to the study, science is a step closer to proving the Ancient Astronaut theory as well as the hypothesis of our species being engineered by advanced aliens through DNA manipulation. The scientific duo stated in the Icarus Journal that:\nOnce fixed, the code might stay unchanged over cosmological timescales. In fact, it is the most durable construct known. Therefore it represents an exceptionally reliable storage for an intelligent signature. Once the genome is appropriately rewritten, the new code with a signature will stay frozen in the cell and its progeny, which might then be delivered through space and time.\nIn other words, the human DNA is designed with such a precision that it reveals an \u201censemble of arithmetical and ideographical patterns of symbolic language\u201d.\nAs a result of this study, other researchers now discuss the probability of us humans being engineered outside of our solar system by our alien creators several billion years ago, a hypothesis strongly supported by the many ancient texts found on Earth that speak of the creation of mankind and the creator gods or deities.\nHowever, the study also focuses on the idea that life on Earth emerged as a result of microbiological particles being carried throughout the cosmos on asteroids and comets, which behave as giant transportation devices that plant life on different planets capable of sustaining it. This theory differs from the classic evolution theory, as its supporters believe that we were not a random product of evolution, but a certain creation of our makers, designed and sent to Earth on purpose.\nCherbak and Makukov presented a detailed analysis of the human genome that shows a previously ignored precision-type method in the mapping between the DNA\u2019s nucleotides and amino acids. The duo stated that:\nSimple arrangements of the code reveal an ensemble of arithmetical and ideographical patterns of symbolic language. Accurate and systematic, these underlying patterns appear as a product of precision logic and nontrivial computing.\nSo is it possible that we were designed by advanced alien beings with extended knowledge of creating life through DNA manipulation? If so, is the human species a product originating from another planet in this vast universe? Or is it rather a product designed on Earth by an advanced race who anchored on this planet in the ancient past, as many timeworn texts suggests?\nWhile we cannot deny the panspermia hypothesis claiming that life on the earth originated from microorganisms or chemical precursors of life present in outer space that were able to initiate life upon reaching a suitable environment, we find it likely that life on Earth is in fact a product of more intelligent species with the ability to create life.\nWhatever may be the case, the upcoming years will reveal more information regarding topics that were until now forbidden or ignored.",

I couldn&rsquo;t work him out.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Then he just stood there and sang one of the songs from my routine earlier.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was otherworldly. &ldquo;I stared at him like he was a dark jewel dredged up from the deepest ocean.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I got down on my knees and asked him who I should praise.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I looked him right in the eye and told him I wanted it all. &ldquo;I told him I&rsquo;d do anything.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><iframe data-instgrm-payload-id=\"instagram-media-payload-0\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BZLFlzBAO6N/embed/captioned/?cr=1&v=7&wp=658&rd=https%3A%2F%2Fworldtruth.tv&rp=%2Flady-gaga-i-regret-selling-my-soul-to-illuminati-dark-forces%2F#%7B%22ci%22%3A0%2C%22os%22%3A3533.9950025081635%7D\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Before meeting the man she describes as &ldquo;my illuminated prince,&rdquo; Gaga had little commercial success or public recognition, as a struggling performer who mostly played in dive bars, in burlesque clubs, and at late night revues, Gaga was able to create the music and achieve everything she had ever dreamed of, in exchange for one thing:</p>\n<p>Her &ldquo;soul&rdquo;.Outside the Mercury Lounge in New York City that night, Gaga &ldquo;concluded a deal&rdquo; with the prince and instantly found that &ldquo;success was a cinch&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>In exchange for her soul, Gaga was able to create the music for which she became famous with the most well-respected collaborators, producers, and promoters in the business queuing up to work with the unknown club singer.</p>\n<p>Within one year she was one of the biggest selling artists on the planet. &ldquo;His promises came true very quickly.&rdquo;&rdquo;At the start, I thought we made a good team. But it wasn&rsquo;t long before I began to suffer.&rdquo;Gaga has fought with conflicting forces battling for supremacy inside herself for years, and she&rsquo;s frequently at war with herself in the documentary.</p>\n<p>One side is driven to perform, whistle the other seems to be struggling with &ldquo;dark forces&rdquo;.Gaga has suffered from the physical illness, fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition, for years, which she is the physical manifestation of her fight to get out of the Illuminati-controlled record industry and break her contract with the &ldquo;dark prince&rdquo;.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>They may give you special powers, outer beauty, talent, and wealth for a while&hellip; but it doesn&rsquo;t last,&rdquo; Gaga said. &ldquo;This is the reason why so many people who dabble in the dark arts are so unhappy. They flicker bright like a morning star and then wind up committing suicide or destroying themselves with substance abuse.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>They flicker bright like a morning star and then wind up committing suicide or destroying themselves with substance abuse.&rdquo;Lady Gaga has recently announced that she is rescheduling the European leg of her Joanne World Tour, citing the &ldquo;severe pain&rdquo; that is impacting &ldquo;her ability to perform&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>In a post from her official <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BZLFlzBAO6N/\">Instagram page</a>, featuring a photograph of herself holding a crucifix and praying, she said she had &ldquo;always been honest&rdquo; about her physical and spiritual health conditions, and has been &ldquo;searching for years to get to the bottom of them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As I get stronger and when I feel ready, I will tell my story in more depth and plan to take this on strongly so I can not only raise awareness but expand research for others who suffer as I do, so I can help make a difference,&rdquo; wrote Gaga.</p>",

                "text": "Pop star Lady Gaga has spoken openly about her membership of the Illuminati for the first time to say that she regrets joining the secret society.\nGaga, a sufferer of the painful fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), says she believes her longterm illness is the result of her allowing \u201cdark forces\u201d to manifest themselves in her body when she \u201csold her soul\u201d to \u201cthe Illuminati\u201d early on in her career.\nThe singer spoke candidly in her upcoming Netflix produced Gaga: Five Foot Two documentary which is meant to be a warts-and-all portrait of the troubled star.However, the final cut appears to be more of a fly-on-the-wall footage montage of rehearsals, studio sessions, public appearances, private late-night conversations, medical appointments, and multiple tearful breakdowns.\nAds by Revcontent\nAccording to production staff, many of the interview scenes were left on the cutting room floor due to \u201corders from above\u201d.\nWhen describing some of the more interesting scenes that were cut from the final edit, production staff revealed that Gaga recalled meeting with a Catholic priest to discuss undergoing an exorcism to rid her body of the \u201cdark spirituality\u201d that she invited into her body during \u201cSatanic rituals\u201d early on in her career.\nShe described how she was first inducted into the Illuminati by \u201cdonating her soul\u201d which she says took place at a club in New York\u2019s Lower East Side after performing a burlesque show in 2006.\nGaga described the experience as \u201cvery real and visceral, not metaphorical at all.\u201d\n\u201cI had just been on stage, it was a good show, I was high on the love and applause from the crowd.\n\u201cI was outside lighting a cigarette, thinking about scoring some more cocaine.\n\u201cI was aching for more. More of everything. I just wanted to feel good. Feel anything.\n\u201cThen this man, a strangely ageless man in a suit, spoke to me.\n\u201cHe was leaning against the wall, smoking, and he said to me\n\u2018I think you\u2019ve got what it takes. Do you want it?\u2019\n\u201cI asked what \u2018it\u2019 was. I thought he was coming on to me.\n\u201cBut he smiled and said \u2018Everything. Success. Fame. Riches. Power. Do you want it all?\u2019\n\u201cI looked at him curiously. I couldn\u2019t work him out.\n\u201cThen he just stood there and sang one of the songs from my routine earlier.\n\u201cIt was otherworldly. \u201cI stared at him like he was a dark jewel dredged up from the deepest ocean.\n\u201cI got down on my knees and asked him who I should praise.\n\u201cI looked him right in the eye and told him I wanted it all. \u201cI told him I\u2019d do anything.\u201d\nBefore meeting the man she describes as \u201cmy illuminated prince,\u201d Gaga had little commercial success or public recognition, as a struggling performer who mostly played in dive bars, in burlesque clubs, and at late night revues, Gaga was able to create the music and achieve everything she had ever dreamed of, in exchange for one thing:\nHer \u201csoul\u201d.Outside the Mercury Lounge in New York City that night, Gaga \u201cconcluded a deal\u201d with the prince and instantly found that \u201csuccess was a cinch\u201d.\nIn exchange for her soul, Gaga was able to create the music for which she became famous with the most well-respected collaborators, producers, and promoters in the business queuing up to work with the unknown club singer.\nWithin one year she was one of the biggest selling artists on the planet. \u201cHis promises came true very quickly.\u201d\u201dAt the start, I thought we made a good team. But it wasn\u2019t long before I began to suffer.\u201dGaga has fought with conflicting forces battling for supremacy inside herself for years, and she\u2019s frequently at war with herself in the documentary.\nOne side is driven to perform, whistle the other seems to be struggling with \u201cdark forces\u201d.Gaga has suffered from the physical illness, fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition, for years, which she is the physical manifestation of her fight to get out of the Illuminati-controlled record industry and break her contract with the \u201cdark prince\u201d.\u201d\nThey may give you special powers, outer beauty, talent, and wealth for a while\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t last,\u201d Gaga said. \u201cThis is the reason why so many people who dabble in the dark arts are so unhappy. They flicker bright like a morning star and then wind up committing suicide or destroying themselves with substance abuse.\u201d\nThey flicker bright like a morning star and then wind up committing suicide or destroying themselves with substance abuse.\u201dLady Gaga has recently announced that she is rescheduling the European leg of her Joanne World Tour, citing the \u201csevere pain\u201d that is impacting \u201cher ability to perform\u201d.\nIn a post from her official Instagram page, featuring a photograph of herself holding a crucifix and praying, she said she had \u201calways been honest\u201d about her physical and spiritual health conditions, and has been \u201csearching for years to get to the bottom of them.\u201d\n\u201cAs I get stronger and when I feel ready, I will tell my story in more depth and plan to take this on strongly so I can not only raise awareness but expand research for others who suffer as I do, so I can help make a difference,\u201d wrote Gaga.",

They require tremendous strength, stamina and expert troubleshooting to keep running. Full-auto weapons overheat and jam. They demand incredible strength to keep aimed on target. They require expert reloading and weapons clearing in the case of jams, and the hotel room would have been so full of smoke and powder residue that it would be almost impossible to keep breathing from that enclosed space.</p>\n<p>Far from what the firearms-illiterate media claims, these are not systems that any Joe off the street can just pick up and use to effortlessly mow down 500 people. Running these systems requires extensive training, experience and stamina. It is physically impossible for a guy like Stephen Paddock to operate such a system in the sustained, effective manner that we witnessed, especially when shooting from an elevated position which throws off all the ranging of the weapon system.</p>\n<p><a data-delivery=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=5d%2F5mSEeV34RYCLB5i%2BINQrs1DMc%2BbZE9BFMyb5Fnj8E5hG8Wj9QCfLh4mV7z%2B0Gj4qsVyYnX6a%2FW8v8xaCTjPJvBD94oxg0GFiF4vN0ywpeA6Ei8eYC3Q6WhtaS1XtLGh4gmTLK%2FXu0ZFwxgZFgzvCBzx35fAEPQxX6hvpyb3zMNM8lXkaMayWdr25iSpBHwxcF8%2B%2FT7bnYzMpH1Pg%2FyEDuNyYI5WMO%2B3kiOqtf%2F76CwvYaz5CV3mrm4pr%2FjzZT5%2Bj2EXmMV3IZ9sZJcS1bM5GrZS74insC9F0rHFfvmcy3Kk5evW%2FrezhWf%2BO2Hg6czPlcTPgrJ%2BseLRghJc0LLwPKtP3yaZ%2BKAGCb5ac4eTs0UPKTKHK7GCsKxusg2wZV%2Ff8Crka8D%2BPrqhgE3Wp8%2FBSlFyKZpZ1W0yA3IFDjH9l4NEsTZBhmlHj3%2FfdjHKRAzrwcgiLepXTMKHlSrBX3kL8btVJUxVjLJzKnqRJlNa0%2FK%2F8fgPS%2Bh5zIjRc%2B7B5kb4uhe0mI1moSEhTXAHWi2sGmlDs23xhoZER8D8FrqO3js5rMCkcSGo6USPmPIFEy80XGO94dCpcArMQ%2BE0QetyrX%2F8Xh%2FAc1KANp8RjOQHAqFsIX5cfibXig%2BOXRpRoZPVIqnUPxgSBiahZSfBQSHMhy6ARt60keC%2FB8FtDhrCeaTgPr4Gyld9zxVzhQG%2B3EyksVkBPbM6avOuRYGIo3MlnjcbRZXqxKTNsUN9YdD486%2FTSRf5og3kHVmUDfP3XFr9T9rmG%2FN2PQJ9LTQQ9I7S9UroZ2koGqGVn1rpAq7%2BsOm8rG5jLm517zxtgVrDIaDf0btuW3M1q4GD7yqcTMw49L%2BEIHpSWq7RVhZYX4MTXKT0azWKmNx%2FbLSQN1IDkbwHQxdk%2B%2B16UWrZhCv25hl9V3ipR4mnDSYp67bmQStRw7%2Fsy6ziQK67ae%2B%2FalPpdoQsElgEiZaRuft3%2FjYmdn59ti9EOTCSSTfW4h49xDQBvzUM1P8Moig%2Bs5IkjTIMNceOgaiBgtYTSdXkl3LBTZkilvwCI2mvRSat2ek%2F2KebM%3D&s2s=1\" data-id=\"5d%2F5mSEeV34RYCLB5i%2BINQrs1DMc%2BbZE9BFMyb5Fnj8E5hG8Wj9QCfLh4mV7z%2B0Gj4qsVyYnX6a%2FW8v8xaCTjPJvBD94oxg0GFiF4vN0ywpeA6Ei8eYC3Q6WhtaS1XtLGh4gmTLK%2FXu0ZFwxgZFgzvCBzx35fAEPQxX6hvpyb3zMNM8lXkaMayWdr25iSpBHwxcF8%2B%2FT7bnYzMpH1Pg%2FyEDuNyYI5WMO%2B3kiOqtf%2F76CwvYaz5CV3mrm4pr%2FjzZT5%2Bj2EXmMV3IZ9sZJcS1bM5GrZS74insC9F0rHFfvmcy3Kk5evW%2FrezhWf%2BO2Hg6czPlcTPgrJ%2BseLRghJc0LLwPKtP3yaZ%2BKAGCb5ac4eTs0UPKTKHK7GCsKxusg2wZV%2Ff8Crka8D%2BPrqhgE3Wp8%2FBSlFyKZpZ1W0yA3IFDjH9l4NEsTZBhmlHj3%2FfdjHKRAzrwcgiLepXTMKHlSrBX3kL8btVJUxVjLJzKnqRJlNa0%2FK%2F8fgPS%2Bh5zIjRc%2B7B5kb4uhe0mI1moSEhTXAHWi2sGmlDs23xhoZER8D8FrqO3js5rMCkcSGo6USPmPIFEy80XGO94dCpcArMQ%2BE0QetyrX%2F8Xh%2FAc1KANp8RjOQHAqFsIX5cfibXig%2BOXRpRoZPVIqnUPxgSBiahZSfBQSHMhy6ARt60keC%2FB8FtDhrCeaTgPr4Gyld9zxVzhQG%2B3EyksVkBPbM6avOuRYGIo3MlnjcbRZXqxKTNsUN9YdD486%2FTSRf5og3kHVmUDfP3XFr9T9rmG%2FN2PQJ9LTQQ9I7S9UroZ2koGqGVn1rpAq7%2BsOm8rG5jLm517zxtgVrDIaDf0btuW3M1q4GD7yqcTMw49L%2BEIHpSWq7RVhZYX4MTXKT0azWKmNx%2FbLSQN1IDkbwHQxdk%2B%2B16UWrZhCv25hl9V3ipR4mnDSYp67bmQStRw7%2Fsy6ziQK67ae%2B%2FalPpdoQsElgEiZaRuft3%2FjYmdn59ti9EOTCSSTfW4h49xDQBvzUM1P8Moig%2Bs5IkjTIMNceOgaiBgtYTSdXkl3LBTZkilvwCI2mvRSat2ek%2F2KebM%3D\" data-target=\"https://secure.sjuggerudtruewealth.com/?cid=MKT431894&eid=MKT445526&rev_campaign_id=645695\" href=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=5d%2F5mSEeV34RYCLB5i%2BINQrs1DMc%2BbZE9BFMyb5Fnj8E5hG8Wj9QCfLh4mV7z%2B0Gj4qsVyYnX6a%2FW8v8xaCTjPJvBD94oxg0GFiF4vN0ywpeA6Ei8eYC3Q6WhtaS1XtLGh4gmTLK%2FXu0ZFwxgZFgzvCBzx35fAEPQxX6hvpyb3zMNM8lXkaMayWdr25iSpBHwxcF8%2B%2FT7bnYzMpH1Pg%2FyEDuNyYI5WMO%2B3kiOqtf%2F76CwvYaz5CV3mrm4pr%2FjzZT5%2Bj2EXmMV3IZ9sZJcS1bM5GrZS74insC9F0rHFfvmcy3Kk5evW%2FrezhWf%2BO2Hg6czPlcTPgrJ%2BseLRghJc0LLwPKtP3yaZ%2BKAGCb5ac4eTs0UPKTKHK7GCsKxusg2wZV%2Ff8Crka8D%2BPrqhgE3Wp8%2FBSlFyKZpZ1W0yA3IFDjH9l4NEsTZBhmlHj3%2FfdjHKRAzrwcgiLepXTMKHlSrBX3kL8btVJUxVjLJzKnqRJlNa0%2FK%2F8fgPS%2Bh5zIjRc%2B7B5kb4uhe0mI1moSEhTXAHWi2sGmlDs23xhoZER8D8FrqO3js5rMCkcSGo6USPmPIFEy80XGO94dCpcArMQ%2BE0QetyrX%2F8Xh%2FAc1KANp8RjOQHAqFsIX5cfibXig%2BOXRpRoZPVIqnUPxgSBiahZSfBQSHMhy6ARt60keC%2FB8FtDhrCeaTgPr4Gyld9zxVzhQG%2B3EyksVkBPbM6avOuRYGIo3MlnjcbRZXqxKTNsUN9YdD486%2FTSRf5og3kHVmUDfP3XFr9T9rmG%2FN2PQJ9LTQQ9I7S9UroZ2koGqGVn1rpAq7%2BsOm8rG5jLm517zxtgVrDIaDf0btuW3M1q4GD7yqcTMw49L%2BEIHpSWq7RVhZYX4MTXKT0azWKmNx%2FbLSQN1IDkbwHQxdk%2B%2B16UWrZhCv25hl9V3ipR4mnDSYp67bmQStRw7%2Fsy6ziQK67ae%2B%2FalPpdoQsElgEiZaRuft3%2FjYmdn59ti9EOTCSSTfW4h49xDQBvzUM1P8Moig%2Bs5IkjTIMNceOgaiBgtYTSdXkl3LBTZkilvwCI2mvRSat2ek%2F2KebM%3D&s2s=1\"><figure><img src=\"https://img.revcontent.com/?url=https://revcontent-p0.s3.amazonaws.com/content/images/15792053321019241837.jpg&static=true&pos=face&h=315&w=420&static=true&fmt=jpeg\"> </img></figure></a></p>\n<p>Far from being a Navy Seal, Stephen Paddock is a retired accountant senior citizen with a gambling problem and a flabby physique. The only way he could have carried out this shooting is if he were transformed into a human superweapon through a magic wand. I&rsquo;m calling this &ldquo;Mission IMPOSSIBLE&rdquo; because of the physical impossibility of a retired, untrained senior citizen pulling this off.</p>\n<p>Here are 10+ reasons why the official narrative is complete B.S.</p>\n<p><strong>#1: As many as 10 rifles were found in his hotel room&hellip; but only one shooter?</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/las-vegas-concert-gunman-identified-stephen-paddock-64-article-1.3535944\">NY Daily News</a> is now reporting that Stephen Paddock &ldquo;brought at least 10 weapons into a Las Vegas hotel room.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Why would a single shooter need 10 rifles? Managing just one full auto weapon system is so difficult that it&rsquo;s probably beyond the physical capabilities of a 64-year-old retired accountant, which is what Paddock was.</p>\n<p>The fact that 10 rifles were found in his hotel room says three very important things:</p>\n<p>#1 The rifles were staged for <strong>more than one shooter</strong>.</p>\n<p>#2 The operation was extremely well funded.</p>\n<p>#3 The attack took a tremendous amount of time to set up, because you don&rsquo;t just walk 10 rifles up to your hotel room in a single trip.</p>\n<p><strong>#2: As with many orchestrated shootings, the scapegoat was murdered before he could talk</strong></p>\n<p>According to numerous media reports, Paddock was found dead in his hotel room, shot to death. The official narrative claims that he shot himself before the police breached the room, but <strong>that is an assumption, not an established fact</strong>. There is no evidence whatsoever that Paddock shot himself. It is simply assumed that he did so. I would ask to see the ballistics evidence of the shot that killed him.</p>\n<p>Isn&rsquo;t it all convenient? There&rsquo;s no one left to question, and they don&rsquo;t even have to drug the guy into oblivion like they did the Aurora, Colorado shooter named James Holmes. Eliminating the scapegoat is the oldest trick in the book, as we were all reminded with the shooting of JFK.</p>\n<p><strong>#3: Why are there no muzzle flashes visible from the 32nd-floor Mandalay Bay windows in any of the videos that captured the shooting?</strong></p>\n<p>If you look at the shooting videos that have been posted online, none of them show any muzzle flashes from the room on the 32nd floor that we&rsquo;ve been told is the source of the shooting. How can that be? The following video captures the sound of the automatic weapons fire &mdash; and even appears to capture at least TWO weapons firing simultaneously &mdash; yet shows <strong>no muzzle flashes from the 32nd floor windows</strong> of the Mandalay Bay hotel.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WVE7g6dGa9I\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>I challenge anyone to listen to the gunfire in these online videos and conclude it&rsquo;s only from a single weapon. The very idea is totally absurd. You can clearly hear at least two automatic weapons systems firing over each other.</p>\n<p>Listen to the automatic weapons fire at about the 2:00 mark in the video below. <strong>It&rsquo;s clearly coming from multiple weapons:</strong></p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGKEGoKwASM\"></iframe></figure>\n<h4> <strong>#5: ISIS has openly claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that Paddock &ldquo;converted to Islam&rdquo; months earlier</strong></h4>\n<p>ISIS has already claimed responsibility for the Las Vegas shooting:</p>\n<p><em>Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a shooting that killed at least 50 people and wounded over 400 in Las Vegas early on Monday, and said the attacker had converted to Islam a few months ago.</em></p>\n<p>ISIS has a long track record of only claiming responsibility for events they inspired or planned. It would not be in the interests of ISIS to falsely claim credit for an attack they did not help carry out, as that would discredit their own supporters and funding sources.</p>\n<p><strong>#6: Stephen Paddock had no familiarity with automatic weapons and no military training; was not a &ldquo;gun guy&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/stephen-paddock-retired-accountant-vegas-gunman-150558606.html\">Yahoo News</a>:</p>\n<p><em>Saying his family was in shock, Paddock&rsquo;s brother told US media he could not understand what motivated his elder brother.</em></p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Where the hell did he get automatic weapons? He has no military background or anything like that,&rdquo; Eric Paddock told CBS News.</em></p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a guy who lived in a house in Mesquite, drove down and gambled in Las Vegas. He did stuff. Eat burritos.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>And from <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/las-vegas-concert-gunman-identified-stephen-paddock-64-article-1.3535944\">NY Daily News</a>:</p>\n<p><em>Eric said his brother was typically no fan of such weaponry. &ldquo;Not an avid gun guy at all,&rdquo; Eric Paddock told CBS News outside his home in Waterford Lakes, Fla.</em></p>\n<p><strong>#7: How does a 64-year-old accountant with no military training possess the strength and stamina to fire a fully automatic weapon for nearly 10 minutes?</strong></p>\n<p>People who aren&rsquo;t familiar with firearms have no idea how difficult it is to conduct sustained fire with an automatic weapon. It requires tremendous strength, endurance and training &mdash; something that Stephen Paddock had none of. Military special forces operatives train for years to be able to manage such weapons and handle all the problems they pose (barrel overheating, ammo jams, double feeds, recoil management, etc.). The idea that some senior citizen accountant can just pick up a machine gun and lay down thousands of rounds of effective fire in a sustained, 10-minute assault even though he had no experience with such weapons is <strong>completely ludicrous</strong>.</p>\n<p>It actually looks like someone else staged all the guns in the room, perhaps with Paddock&rsquo;s willingness, then shot and killed Paddock to make him the scapegoat.</p>\n<p>Numerous media reports confirm that Paddock had no familiarity with guns and certainly didn&rsquo;t have any experience with automatic weapons. Via the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4940800/Las-Vegas-shooter-s-brother-says-family-dumbfounded.html\">UK Daily Mail</a>:</p>\n<p><em>Despite being found amid an arsenal of weapons, Eric said that his brother had never been &lsquo;an avid gun guy at all&rsquo;, adding that he was at a loss as to where Stephen got his arsenal of automatic weapons from.</em></p>\n<p><strong>#8: Stephen Paddock was gambling away huge amounts of cash&hellip; where did he get all that money?</strong></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/las-vegas-shooting/stephen-paddock-las-vegas-shooting-suspect-identified-n806471\">NBC News</a>, Paddock was engaged in high-stakes gambling to the tune of as much as $30,000 per day:</p>\n<p><em>On several occasions, Stephen Paddock gambled more than $10,000 per day &mdash; and in some cases more than than $20,000 and $30,000 a day &mdash; at Las Vegas casinos, according to an NBC News source who read the suspect&rsquo;s Multiple Currency Transaction Reports (CTR) and a casino gaming executive.</em></p>\n<p>Was he paid to be part of an operation that would then be blamed on him by making him the scapegoat? Some media reports state that Paddock was a wealthy real estate investor. If that&rsquo;s true, why would he blow all that wealth on gambling?</p>\n<p><strong>#9: Stephen Paddock has no criminal history, no record and no apparent beef with anybody</strong></p>\n<p>Further supporting the notion that Stephen Paddock was a scapegoat for all this,</p>\n<p>Via <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/las-vegas-concert-gunman-identified-stephen-paddock-64-article-1.3535944\">NY Daily News</a>:</p>\n<p><em>&hellip;Paddock had no federal, state or local history with law enforcement before his Sunday night rampage that left 58 dead and more than 500 injured. &ldquo;We had no knowledge of this individual,&rdquo; said Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo. &ldquo;We checked all the databases&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4940800/Las-Vegas-shooter-s-brother-says-family-dumbfounded.html\">UK Daily Mail</a>, we learn that Paddock had no affiliation with any particular activist group, political group or religious group as far as anyone knows:</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;&hellip;He added that his brother had &lsquo;no political affiliation, no religious affiliation, as far as we know.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BwVhs-iPm5s\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><strong>#10: <a href=\"https://worldtruth.tv/las-vegas-false-flag-anonymous-4chan-user-warned-of-attack-3-weeks-in-advance/\">The attack required meticulous planning, funding and training&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t some lone senior citizen who just &ldquo;snapped&rdquo;</a></strong></p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s clear from this attack is that it was planned, funded and coordinated. This was not some spontaneous &ldquo;lone wolf&rdquo; scenario; it involved multiple weapons being fired simultaneously, long-term planning, staging and financial logistics.</p>\n<p>The official narrative that claims this retired accountant just &ldquo;snapped&rdquo; and somehow picked up an automatic rifle and expertly laid down highly effective fields of automatic weapons fire for 10 minutes without pause is <strong>so insanely stupid as to be laughable</strong>.</p>\n<p>Only a highly-trained weapons expert with tremendous physical strength, stamina and training could have pulled this off and that&rsquo;s clearly not Stephen Paddock.</p>\n<p><strong>#11: How was the FBI able to almost immediately declare Paddock had no ties to ISIS &mdash; barely 12 hours after the shooting &mdash; when the same agency has spent over a year investigating President Trump with zero evidence linking him to Russia, all while refusing to declare Trump has no ties to Russia?</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, don&rsquo;t you find it amazing how the FBI was able to clear any ISIS connection in less than 12 hours after the shooting? This is the same FBI, remember, that has spent over a year desperately trying to find a Russia conspiracy link to President Trump, yet has been unable to do with any legitimate evidence whatsoever. Yet more than year into their investigation, they refuse to clear President Trump of Russia collusion.</p>\n<p>Isn&rsquo;t that interesting? Somehow, the FBI is so amazingly effective and efficient that they can conclude a massive investigation of Stephen Paddock in a mere 12 hours, yet they never quite seem to complete their investigation of President Trump.</p>\n<p>via:</p>\n<p>naturalnews.com</p>",

                "text": "It\u2019s all hogwash. The \u201cofficial\u201d narrative of how things went down in the Las Vegas massacre is so full of holes that it begs the question of just how deep the truth about this attack really goes.\nWhat we know for sure is that, yes, 59 people were killed (so far) and hundreds were wounded. This wasn\u2019t a \u201choax\u201d shooting \u2014 people actually were shot, wounded and killed (and our prayers go out to all their families for this horrific tragedy). Yet the official narrative that claims Stephen Paddock \u2014 a retired, 64-year-old accountant with absolutely no firearms training, no gun experience and no physical stamina \u2014 was somehow able to expertly wield a highly complex (and physically demanding) weapon system for 10 sustained minutes is total nonsense.\nEven highly trained Navy Seals would have a difficult time running a full auto weapon for 10 minutes straight.\nSuch weapon systems are brutal on the operator. They require tremendous strength, stamina and expert troubleshooting to keep running. Full-auto weapons overheat and jam. They demand incredible strength to keep aimed on target. They require expert reloading and weapons clearing in the case of jams, and the hotel room would have been so full of smoke and powder residue that it would be almost impossible to keep breathing from that enclosed space.\nFar from what the firearms-illiterate media claims, these are not systems that any Joe off the street can just pick up and use to effortlessly mow down 500 people. Running these systems requires extensive training, experience and stamina. It is physically impossible for a guy like Stephen Paddock to operate such a system in the sustained, effective manner that we witnessed, especially when shooting from an elevated position which throws off all the ranging of the weapon system.\nFar from being a Navy Seal, Stephen Paddock is a retired accountant senior citizen with a gambling problem and a flabby physique. The only way he could have carried out this shooting is if he were transformed into a human superweapon through a magic wand. I\u2019m calling this \u201cMission IMPOSSIBLE\u201d because of the physical impossibility of a retired, untrained senior citizen pulling this off.\nHere are 10+ reasons why the official narrative is complete B.S.\n#1: As many as 10 rifles were found in his hotel room\u2026 but only one shooter?\nThe NY Daily News is now reporting that Stephen Paddock \u201cbrought at least 10 weapons into a Las Vegas hotel room.\u201d\nWhy would a single shooter need 10 rifles? Managing just one full auto weapon system is so difficult that it\u2019s probably beyond the physical capabilities of a 64-year-old retired accountant, which is what Paddock was.\nThe fact that 10 rifles were found in his hotel room says three very important things:\n#1 The rifles were staged for more than one shooter.\n#2 The operation was extremely well funded.\n#3 The attack took a tremendous amount of time to set up, because you don\u2019t just walk 10 rifles up to your hotel room in a single trip.\n#2: As with many orchestrated shootings, the scapegoat was murdered before he could talk\nAccording to numerous media reports, Paddock was found dead in his hotel room, shot to death. The official narrative claims that he shot himself before the police breached the room, but that is an assumption, not an established fact. There is no evidence whatsoever that Paddock shot himself. It is simply assumed that he did so. I would ask to see the ballistics evidence of the shot that killed him.\nIsn\u2019t it all convenient? There\u2019s no one left to question, and they don\u2019t even have to drug the guy into oblivion like they did the Aurora, Colorado shooter named James Holmes. Eliminating the scapegoat is the oldest trick in the book, as we were all reminded with the shooting of JFK.\n#3: Why are there no muzzle flashes visible from the 32nd-floor Mandalay Bay windows in any of the videos that captured the shooting?\nIf you look at the shooting videos that have been posted online, none of them show any muzzle flashes from the room on the 32nd floor that we\u2019ve been told is the source of the shooting. How can that be? The following video captures the sound of the automatic weapons fire \u2014 and even appears to capture at least TWO weapons firing simultaneously \u2014 yet shows no muzzle flashes from the 32nd floor windows of the Mandalay Bay hotel.\nI challenge anyone to listen to the gunfire in these online videos and conclude it\u2019s only from a single weapon. The very idea is totally absurd. You can clearly hear at least two automatic weapons systems firing over each other.\nListen to the automatic weapons fire at about the 2:00 mark in the video below. It\u2019s clearly coming from multiple weapons:\n#5: ISIS has openly claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that Paddock \u201cconverted to Islam\u201d months earlier\nISIS has already claimed responsibility for the Las Vegas shooting:\nIslamic State has claimed responsibility for a shooting that killed at least 50 people and wounded over 400 in Las Vegas early on Monday, and said the attacker had converted to Islam a few months ago.\nISIS has a long track record of only claiming responsibility for events they inspired or planned. It would not be in the interests of ISIS to falsely claim credit for an attack they did not help carry out, as that would discredit their own supporters and funding sources.\n#6: Stephen Paddock had no familiarity with automatic weapons and no military training; was not a \u201cgun guy\u201d\nFrom Yahoo News:\nSaying his family was in shock, Paddock\u2019s brother told US media he could not understand what motivated his elder brother.\n\u201cWhere the hell did he get automatic weapons? He has no military background or anything like that,\u201d Eric Paddock told CBS News.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy who lived in a house in Mesquite, drove down and gambled in Las Vegas. He did stuff. Eat burritos.\u201d\nAnd from NY Daily News:\nEric said his brother was typically no fan of such weaponry. \u201cNot an avid gun guy at all,\u201d Eric Paddock told CBS News outside his home in Waterford Lakes, Fla.\n#7: How does a 64-year-old accountant with no military training possess the strength and stamina to fire a fully automatic weapon for nearly 10 minutes?\nPeople who aren\u2019t familiar with firearms have no idea how difficult it is to conduct sustained fire with an automatic weapon. It requires tremendous strength, endurance and training \u2014 something that Stephen Paddock had none of. Military special forces operatives train for years to be able to manage such weapons and handle all the problems they pose (barrel overheating, ammo jams, double feeds, recoil management, etc.). The idea that some senior citizen accountant can just pick up a machine gun and lay down thousands of rounds of effective fire in a sustained, 10-minute assault even though he had no experience with such weapons is completely ludicrous.\nIt actually looks like someone else staged all the guns in the room, perhaps with Paddock\u2019s willingness, then shot and killed Paddock to make him the scapegoat.\nNumerous media reports confirm that Paddock had no familiarity with guns and certainly didn\u2019t have any experience with automatic weapons. Via the UK Daily Mail:\nDespite being found amid an arsenal of weapons, Eric said that his brother had never been \u2018an avid gun guy at all\u2019, adding that he was at a loss as to where Stephen got his arsenal of automatic weapons from.\n#8: Stephen Paddock was gambling away huge amounts of cash\u2026 where did he get all that money?\nAccording to NBC News, Paddock was engaged in high-stakes gambling to the tune of as much as $30,000 per day:\nOn several occasions, Stephen Paddock gambled more than $10,000 per day \u2014 and in some cases more than than $20,000 and $30,000 a day \u2014 at Las Vegas casinos, according to an NBC News source who read the suspect\u2019s Multiple Currency Transaction Reports (CTR) and a casino gaming executive.\nWas he paid to be part of an operation that would then be blamed on him by making him the scapegoat? Some media reports state that Paddock was a wealthy real estate investor. If that\u2019s true, why would he blow all that wealth on gambling?\n#9: Stephen Paddock has no criminal history, no record and no apparent beef with anybody\nFurther supporting the notion that Stephen Paddock was a scapegoat for all this,\nVia NY Daily News:\n\u2026Paddock had no federal, state or local history with law enforcement before his Sunday night rampage that left 58 dead and more than 500 injured. \u201cWe had no knowledge of this individual,\u201d said Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo. \u201cWe checked all the databases\u2026\u201d\nFrom the UK Daily Mail, we learn that Paddock had no affiliation with any particular activist group, political group or religious group as far as anyone knows:\n\u201c\u2026He added that his brother had \u2018no political affiliation, no religious affiliation, as far as we know.\u201d\n#10: The attack required meticulous planning, funding and training\u2026 it wasn\u2019t some lone senior citizen who just \u201csnapped\u201d\nWhat\u2019s clear from this attack is that it was planned, funded and coordinated. This was not some spontaneous \u201clone wolf\u201d scenario; it involved multiple weapons being fired simultaneously, long-term planning, staging and financial logistics.\nThe official narrative that claims this retired accountant just \u201csnapped\u201d and somehow picked up an automatic rifle and expertly laid down highly effective fields of automatic weapons fire for 10 minutes without pause is so insanely stupid as to be laughable.\nOnly a highly-trained weapons expert with tremendous physical strength, stamina and training could have pulled this off and that\u2019s clearly not Stephen Paddock.\n#11: How was the FBI able to almost immediately declare Paddock had no ties to ISIS \u2014 barely 12 hours after the shooting \u2014 when the same agency has spent over a year investigating President Trump with zero evidence linking him to Russia, all while refusing to declare Trump has no ties to Russia?\nFinally, don\u2019t you find it amazing how the FBI was able to clear any ISIS connection in less than 12 hours after the shooting? This is the same FBI, remember, that has spent over a year desperately trying to find a Russia conspiracy link to President Trump, yet has been unable to do with any legitimate evidence whatsoever. Yet more than year into their investigation, they refuse to clear President Trump of Russia collusion.\nIsn\u2019t that interesting? Somehow, the FBI is so amazingly effective and efficient that they can conclude a massive investigation of Stephen Paddock in a mere 12 hours, yet they never quite seem to complete their investigation of President Trump.\nvia:\nnaturalnews.com",

Fox News Host is Making National News. Find out Why.</a></figcaption></figure></a></p>\n<p>The discovery could be conclusive proof that Hilter was living in Argentina after faking his death</p>\n<p>NPr.org <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/20/533675156/photos-trove-of-nazi-artifacts-uncovered-in-argentina\">reports</a>: The artifacts were found at a home in Beccar, north of the capital, and authorities tell The Associated Press that &ldquo;they suspect they are originals that belonged to high-ranking Nazis in Germany during World War II.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Security Minister Patricia Bullrich told the wire service the artifacts are believed to be original pieces &mdash; including a magnifying glass accompanied by a photo of Hitler holding a magnifying glass that looks similar.</p>\n<p>The combination of object and photo &ldquo;is a way to commercialize them, showing that they were used by the horror, by the Fuhrer. There are photos of him with the objects,&rdquo; the minister told AP.</p>\n<p>The jaw-dropping collection of artifacts includes a children&rsquo;s harmonica in a box full of swastikas</p>\n<p>Other chilling objects discovered include a statue of the Nazi eagle, weapons and an hourglass with Nazi symbols.</p>\n<p>Police also found a number of toys that authorities believe were used to indoctrinate children.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There are Nazi objects used by kids, but with the party&rsquo;s propaganda,&rdquo; Commissioner Marcelo El Haibe from the federal police told The New York Times. He added, &ldquo;There were jigsaw puzzles and little wood pieces to build houses, but they always featured party-related images and symbols.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The hidden area also held mummified animals and items originally from Egypt, Japan and China, according to the ministry.</p>\n<p>Argentina&rsquo;s Ministry of Security said the artifacts were all &ldquo;of illegal origin and of great interest due to their historical value.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Many prominent Nazis fled to Argentina at the end of World War II, including Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann and Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. The Washington Post reports that both men lived near the suburb where the artifacts were discovered.The investigation started &ldquo;when authorities found artworks of illicit origin in a gallery in north Buenos Aires,&rdquo; according to the AP.</p>\n<p>Then, &ldquo;agents with the international police force Interpol began following the collector and with a judicial order raided the house on June 8.&rdquo; The collector &ldquo;remains free but under investigation by a federal judge.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not clear when the items arrived in Argentina, or who brought them there. Once authorities have completed an investigation, Newsweek writes, the artifacts will be given to the Holocaust Museum of Buenos Aires.</p>\n<p>Claudio Avruj, the minister of human rights and cultural pluralism, said, &ldquo;This decision to bring these pieces to the Holocaust Museum will put strong barriers against hatred and discrimination,&rdquo; according to Newsweek. &ldquo;These facts show that the Holocaust did not end with the passage of time because there are people who try to keep this policy of death, discrimination, and hatred alive.&rdquo;</p>",

The jaw-dropping collection of artifacts includes a children\u2019s harmonica in a box full of swastikas and a large bust relief of Hitler himself.\nArgentina\u2019s Ministry of Security said the artifacts were all \u201cof illegal origin and of great interest due to their historical value.\u201d The game changing find came following a federal police investigation.\nThe discovery could be conclusive proof that Hilter was living in Argentina after faking his death. A few months back, NeonNettle reported that newly released declassified FBI files suggested that Hilter had fled to Argentina in a submarine.\nLast year, new forensic evidence from a Connecticut archaeologist and bone specialist Nick Bellanton, suggested that Hilter never shot himself.\nThe discovery could be conclusive proof that Hilter was living in Argentina after faking his death\nNPr.org reports: The artifacts were found at a home in Beccar, north of the capital, and authorities tell The Associated Press that \u201cthey suspect they are originals that belonged to high-ranking Nazis in Germany during World War II.\n\u201cSecurity Minister Patricia Bullrich told the wire service the artifacts are believed to be original pieces \u2014 including a magnifying glass accompanied by a photo of Hitler holding a magnifying glass that looks similar.\nThe combination of object and photo \u201cis a way to commercialize them, showing that they were used by the horror, by the Fuhrer. There are photos of him with the objects,\u201d the minister told AP.\nThe jaw-dropping collection of artifacts includes a children\u2019s harmonica in a box full of swastikas\nOther chilling objects discovered include a statue of the Nazi eagle, weapons and an hourglass with Nazi symbols.\nPolice also found a number of toys that authorities believe were used to indoctrinate children.\n\u201cThere are Nazi objects used by kids, but with the party\u2019s propaganda,\u201d Commissioner Marcelo El Haibe from the federal police told The New York Times. He added, \u201cThere were jigsaw puzzles and little wood pieces to build houses, but they always featured party-related images and symbols.\u201d\nThe hidden area also held mummified animals and items originally from Egypt, Japan and China, according to the ministry.\nArgentina\u2019s Ministry of Security said the artifacts were all \u201cof illegal origin and of great interest due to their historical value.\u201d\nMany prominent Nazis fled to Argentina at the end of World War II, including Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann and Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. The Washington Post reports that both men lived near the suburb where the artifacts were discovered.The investigation started \u201cwhen authorities found artworks of illicit origin in a gallery in north Buenos Aires,\u201d according to the AP.\nThen, \u201cagents with the international police force Interpol began following the collector and with a judicial order raided the house on June 8.\u201d The collector \u201cremains free but under investigation by a federal judge.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear when the items arrived in Argentina, or who brought them there. Once authorities have completed an investigation, Newsweek writes, the artifacts will be given to the Holocaust Museum of Buenos Aires.\nClaudio Avruj, the minister of human rights and cultural pluralism, said, \u201cThis decision to bring these pieces to the Holocaust Museum will put strong barriers against hatred and discrimination,\u201d according to Newsweek. \u201cThese facts show that the Holocaust did not end with the passage of time because there are people who try to keep this policy of death, discrimination, and hatred alive.\u201d",

caused by those storms was planned, from the beginning, by those who operate in the shadows, deep within the US Government.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When asked if he was saying that the hurricanes happened as a result of Donald Trump backing out of the Paris Climate Agreement, he continued with his emotionally charged rant, saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s related to climate change, but not in that way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump is a very smart man, I&rsquo;m sure he has figured it out, but it, most likely, has nothing to do with him.&rdquo;Russian satellites captured those hurricanes being made with machines.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>They didn&rsquo;t occur naturally, they are another rich man&rsquo;s game.&rdquo;Convincing the public climate change is real does two things: It undermines their leader and keeps the money flowing.&rdquo;Now Cuba needs aid relief, and the US will come to the rescue.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cuba will be in debt to the US and soon there will be US dollars flowing through IMF-controlled Cuban banks.&rdquo;Mr. Putin&rsquo;s microphone appeared to suffer a technical fault shortly before a member of his press team called him away.</p>\n<p>Mainstream Media BlackoutAlthough mainstream media&rsquo;s main focus has been on the devastation in Florida, it has failed report that Cuba has been completely destroyed by severe flooding as 5 feet of water completely engulfs low lying parts of Havana.</p>\n<p>As Irma continues to claim the lives of Cubans, within the 72 hours time frame it took the storm to destroy the country, it has now damaged every region on the island nation leaving the beautiful and historic district underwater.</p>\n<p>Why was Cuba hit the hardest?</p>\n<p>As recent investigations point out that hurricanes are &ldquo;man made&rdquo;, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense for the US to destroy their own country, but Cuba is another case entirely.</p>\n<p>In June, President Donald Trump vowed to treat Cuban government with hostility as he announced that trade and travel restrictions would be implemented in the country.&ldquo;I am canceling the last administration&rsquo;s completely one-sided deal with Cuba,&rdquo; Trump confirmed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They made a deal with a government that spread violence and instability in the region and nothing they got, think about it, nothing they got, they fought for everything and we just didn&rsquo;t fight hard enough, but now, those days are over.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cuba is also one of the few last remaining nations left in the world without a Rothschild-controlled central bank.Other countries on that list include North Korea, Iran, and Syria, all of whom have something in common: They are enemies of the US.</p>\n<p>Making &ldquo;hurricanes with machines&rdquo; may sound like something from a science fiction movie, but engineering storms through artificial weather modification are nothing new.</p>\n<p>One of the world&rsquo;s leading scientists, Dr. Michio Kaku, recently let slip on live TV that Governments have had the ability to create hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and major flooding for years.</p>\n<p>During an interview on mainstream media outlet CBS news, Kaku said that secret government weather modification programs have successfully created hurricanes by spraying the skies with nano particles and storms and then &ldquo;activating&rdquo; storms using &ldquo;lasers&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Government-funded programs such as the High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) was created in the early 1990s and was an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).</p>\n<p>HAARP was capable of &ldquo;weaponizing&rdquo; the weather and has the ability of potentially triggering floods, droughts, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Throughout the life of the program, it had incurred around $250 million in tax-funded construction and operating costs.</p>",

Throughout the life of the program, it had incurred around $250 million in tax-funded construction and operating costs.",

The price of items will not be shown in yen, dollars or the great British pound, but in one currency. This currency is going to be favored by shoppers along with companies as it would be a great deal more convenient than the different currencies of today.</p>\n<p><a data-delivery=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=LU0kPxMaUHjjgYOW66PZ0PxWMIJ2hrVVRwARv2UjodnLSPblrzGR2zCjPNd9odA%2Bkw%2FVOzTdEgN3gn7TA4KfoTzsRRtA00OFb8QBLLBJ%2BMucbw14tEs32riG3j9vWaI3RJLfxlZQHPCxkoIbuE4RvUqn1%2Fq4n2QtqKup7dMHc1bNRfXDFWP9XPtIRmY4B97K0nkSz2JuLKa2WgPG6T9ZWFcYYUTj8%2Ffrr8ol%2Biy5PuSR%2BS%2Bo45npw2bd3XN8FYVLLjQ9RxJGXOLdBs3Xuh4EXEi8BVjAKD1UP8Lb72U9QQ1M8PMLspuubH%2FcxPU2vw2yYDQ396QRzFG2c1PNt4I9J9ubFwOi3utxT9aQLQhs8D%2BrmV6UNmcvRqNPI0MM09ny8iHOoizo%2FtCws%2Fl9Q%2B9%2F7svkVAENvwTfnAZDSN0s06VL1GNkxfN%2FHD0QvEreYV%2BhcnDurU4ax8qYdYNDXA3RLsyIMnYcqXrAdB3nrV2fZNcVjDKjCfVNqbudj%2BPhBqfFUv0qY1fQhEFLk%2FS%2FXzOrqop5WtxLWulOAsicjstiTDa2cNE%2BnX9Zygt0B9TRuf2NKVrPuMlOYTM%2FyQ70dnTekDlTwp7ASlHjOZRqnOMcRc4Lr02eZryrqohysso08iKD4hKvQkCcrkELY4n0knmxN0SToDnMPn1kzk6W4OurJWjYQBowKtcxkJL7Gz%2FAF0RO7ufg8UgVTUAhne3fcVXJ4gDcqv02fNqz8QrthErST43a1VgDaYQUqwC00mlCkd1LWAwH5Xs%2FYyRLBEZofWfXyM9Z1zPhlz2ilTWjoPLgUDZS1eGGCLfZf8GSWCiebMINn8%2BfYBIF%2BTVFFz9Jfcwk79FpOZGem%2BkXAyWlz%2Fb%2Fv2kxDESxFNU7Lu1yh0EJH4fgE4iibXzx4UgTf6XHLNZt2YOJkCqPMHOLxtnh5mcllZUTGuV7%2BpqbGrpdH4IOYBfDoXBp4JDKtbrKcy29CIrUAV9mqgdjhidwVyYyZbfLzkPwdsNu57lsJs9oJGC6pO6d&s2s=1\" data-id=\"LU0kPxMaUHjjgYOW66PZ0PxWMIJ2hrVVRwARv2UjodnLSPblrzGR2zCjPNd9odA%2Bkw%2FVOzTdEgN3gn7TA4KfoTzsRRtA00OFb8QBLLBJ%2BMucbw14tEs32riG3j9vWaI3RJLfxlZQHPCxkoIbuE4RvUqn1%2Fq4n2QtqKup7dMHc1bNRfXDFWP9XPtIRmY4B97K0nkSz2JuLKa2WgPG6T9ZWFcYYUTj8%2Ffrr8ol%2Biy5PuSR%2BS%2Bo45npw2bd3XN8FYVLLjQ9RxJGXOLdBs3Xuh4EXEi8BVjAKD1UP8Lb72U9QQ1M8PMLspuubH%2FcxPU2vw2yYDQ396QRzFG2c1PNt4I9J9ubFwOi3utxT9aQLQhs8D%2BrmV6UNmcvRqNPI0MM09ny8iHOoizo%2FtCws%2Fl9Q%2B9%2F7svkVAENvwTfnAZDSN0s06VL1GNkxfN%2FHD0QvEreYV%2BhcnDurU4ax8qYdYNDXA3RLsyIMnYcqXrAdB3nrV2fZNcVjDKjCfVNqbudj%2BPhBqfFUv0qY1fQhEFLk%2FS%2FXzOrqop5WtxLWulOAsicjstiTDa2cNE%2BnX9Zygt0B9TRuf2NKVrPuMlOYTM%2FyQ70dnTekDlTwp7ASlHjOZRqnOMcRc4Lr02eZryrqohysso08iKD4hKvQkCcrkELY4n0knmxN0SToDnMPn1kzk6W4OurJWjYQBowKtcxkJL7Gz%2FAF0RO7ufg8UgVTUAhne3fcVXJ4gDcqv02fNqz8QrthErST43a1VgDaYQUqwC00mlCkd1LWAwH5Xs%2FYyRLBEZofWfXyM9Z1zPhlz2ilTWjoPLgUDZS1eGGCLfZf8GSWCiebMINn8%2BfYBIF%2BTVFFz9Jfcwk79FpOZGem%2BkXAyWlz%2Fb%2Fv2kxDESxFNU7Lu1yh0EJH4fgE4iibXzx4UgTf6XHLNZt2YOJkCqPMHOLxtnh5mcllZUTGuV7%2BpqbGrpdH4IOYBfDoXBp4JDKtbrKcy29CIrUAV9mqgdjhidwVyYyZbfLzkPwdsNu57lsJs9oJGC6pO6d\" data-target=\"https://pro.oxfordclub.com/m/1356476?rev_campaign_id=613580\" href=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=LU0kPxMaUHjjgYOW66PZ0PxWMIJ2hrVVRwARv2UjodnLSPblrzGR2zCjPNd9odA%2Bkw%2FVOzTdEgN3gn7TA4KfoTzsRRtA00OFb8QBLLBJ%2BMucbw14tEs32riG3j9vWaI3RJLfxlZQHPCxkoIbuE4RvUqn1%2Fq4n2QtqKup7dMHc1bNRfXDFWP9XPtIRmY4B97K0nkSz2JuLKa2WgPG6T9ZWFcYYUTj8%2Ffrr8ol%2Biy5PuSR%2BS%2Bo45npw2bd3XN8FYVLLjQ9RxJGXOLdBs3Xuh4EXEi8BVjAKD1UP8Lb72U9QQ1M8PMLspuubH%2FcxPU2vw2yYDQ396QRzFG2c1PNt4I9J9ubFwOi3utxT9aQLQhs8D%2BrmV6UNmcvRqNPI0MM09ny8iHOoizo%2FtCws%2Fl9Q%2B9%2F7svkVAENvwTfnAZDSN0s06VL1GNkxfN%2FHD0QvEreYV%2BhcnDurU4ax8qYdYNDXA3RLsyIMnYcqXrAdB3nrV2fZNcVjDKjCfVNqbudj%2BPhBqfFUv0qY1fQhEFLk%2FS%2FXzOrqop5WtxLWulOAsicjstiTDa2cNE%2BnX9Zygt0B9TRuf2NKVrPuMlOYTM%2FyQ70dnTekDlTwp7ASlHjOZRqnOMcRc4Lr02eZryrqohysso08iKD4hKvQkCcrkELY4n0knmxN0SToDnMPn1kzk6W4OurJWjYQBowKtcxkJL7Gz%2FAF0RO7ufg8UgVTUAhne3fcVXJ4gDcqv02fNqz8QrthErST43a1VgDaYQUqwC00mlCkd1LWAwH5Xs%2FYyRLBEZofWfXyM9Z1zPhlz2ilTWjoPLgUDZS1eGGCLfZf8GSWCiebMINn8%2BfYBIF%2BTVFFz9Jfcwk79FpOZGem%2BkXAyWlz%2Fb%2Fv2kxDESxFNU7Lu1yh0EJH4fgE4iibXzx4UgTf6XHLNZt2YOJkCqPMHOLxtnh5mcllZUTGuV7%2BpqbGrpdH4IOYBfDoXBp4JDKtbrKcy29CIrUAV9mqgdjhidwVyYyZbfLzkPwdsNu57lsJs9oJGC6pO6d&s2s=1\"><figure><video src=\"https://videos.revcontent.com/revcontent/video/upload/c_pad,h_240,w_426,b_blurred:400,f_mp4/v1579628040/revcontent-p0/cr_videos/9597/4213758.mp4\"> </video></figure></a></p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z02QfS1TFaE\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>DEA OF SINGLE CURRENCY STARTED BACK IN 1988 AND WAS CALLED OUTLANDISH The idea of a single currency back in 1988 seemed to be outlandish. One of the biggest changes to the world economy since the 70s has been that flowing money has taken over trade in goods as being the force behind driving the exchange rates. Due to the integration of the financial markets around the globe, the differences in national economic policies that are known to change the interest rates, big transfers of financial assets are made from one country to another.</p>\n<p>The transfers are able to swamp the trade revenue flows in effect on demand and supply of the different currencies and so in the effect on the exchange rates. Telecommunications technology is continuing to grow in advancement and transactions are going to be cheaper and they will get faster. Thanks to economic policies that are uncoordinated, currencies are only going to get even more volatile.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IOFzTvSSOPs\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>THE CURRENCY UNION IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO RESIST</p>\n<p>There is not going to be such as a thing as national monetary policy. The new currency supply would be fixed by a bank that was central. There would be a world inflation rate and thanks to margins that would be narrow, each of the national inflation rates would be in its charge. Countries would be able to use taxes along with spending by the public to offset any falls in demand that was temporary and would need to borrow instead of printing money to finance any deficit of the budget. There would be no recourse to the inflation tax, and so creditors and governments would have to judge borrowing along with lending plans a great deal more carefully than they do at present. This would perhaps mean a huge loss of economic sovereignty; however, trends that make a single currency appealing would take the sovereignty away.</p>\n<p>Even if exchange rates were more or less floating, the individual governments would have policy independence checked by an outside world that was not friendly.NATURAL FORCES WILL PUSH WORLD TOWARDS ECONOMIC INTEGRATION With a new century coming, natural forces are going to keep pushing the world into economic integration that is going to offer a broad choice to governments. They can choose to put up a barricade, or they can just go along with the flow. Preparing for a single currency is going to ensure there are fewer pretend agreements on policy and there will be more real ones. There will be active promotion of the private sectors use of international money along with any national money that exists. It would mean that people would vote using their wallets for a move that would end up as a full currency union.</p>\n<p>In 1998, ten years later, the Economist printed another article promoting globalist agendas, One World, One Money. This was similar to the piece they had written ten years prior, and it went on to try to explain why a more controlled and centralized system is going to be beneficial to the global economy, while at the same time ignoring that a centralized global currency is going to be a huge coup for international banking cartels. It will also be the bottom line, financially, for the banking empire of the Rothschild family.</p>\n<p>Creation of a single global currency is also going to give a great deal of geopolitical capital to international bankers that have not been elected, and it could take power away from the people of nations along with government representatives. But the question is whether or not anyone wants international bankers to have a huge amount of power, politically, on top of a lot of financial influence and the amount of sway they already have in power. People today want to have more say in their own lives and they do not want policy dictated by bureaucrats and bankers.The Rothschild family is keeping a profile that is very low in the public eye.</p>\n<p>However, they do still have many business operations, and these are spread out over a wide array of sectors. There is not any particular member of the Rothschild family seen on the richest list of Forbes, but the family is said to have control over more than 1 trillion dollars in assets worldwide. Therefore they do still have a voice that is strong over the entire geopolitical spectrum, and many see this as a hand that is hidden that manipulates events quietly in the background under a veil of secrecy.</p>",

                "text": "The Economist magazine published that there would be a world currency in place by 2018. Of course, the controlling interest of the magazine is held by the Rothschild family, who think of themselves as the legacy of the magazine. With this in mind, the Economist is operating as a quasi-propaganda arm for the banking empire and it is meant to prime the public opinion that the globalist agenda will implement.\nCONTROLLING INTEREST OF THE ECONOMIST HELD BY ROTHSCHILD FAMILY In the magazine, on January 9, 1988, it was said that 30 years from now people in the United States, Europe and the Japanese along with others in countries that are rich, will be paying for shopping using the same currency. The price of items will not be shown in yen, dollars or the great British pound, but in one currency. This currency is going to be favored by shoppers along with companies as it would be a great deal more convenient than the different currencies of today.\nDEA OF SINGLE CURRENCY STARTED BACK IN 1988 AND WAS CALLED OUTLANDISH The idea of a single currency back in 1988 seemed to be outlandish. One of the biggest changes to the world economy since the 70s has been that flowing money has taken over trade in goods as being the force behind driving the exchange rates. Due to the integration of the financial markets around the globe, the differences in national economic policies that are known to change the interest rates, big transfers of financial assets are made from one country to another.\nThe transfers are able to swamp the trade revenue flows in effect on demand and supply of the different currencies and so in the effect on the exchange rates. Telecommunications technology is continuing to grow in advancement and transactions are going to be cheaper and they will get faster. Thanks to economic policies that are uncoordinated, currencies are only going to get even more volatile.\nTHE CURRENCY UNION IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO RESIST\nThere is not going to be such as a thing as national monetary policy. The new currency supply would be fixed by a bank that was central. There would be a world inflation rate and thanks to margins that would be narrow, each of the national inflation rates would be in its charge. Countries would be able to use taxes along with spending by the public to offset any falls in demand that was temporary and would need to borrow instead of printing money to finance any deficit of the budget. There would be no recourse to the inflation tax, and so creditors and governments would have to judge borrowing along with lending plans a great deal more carefully than they do at present. This would perhaps mean a huge loss of economic sovereignty; however, trends that make a single currency appealing would take the sovereignty away.\nEven if exchange rates were more or less floating, the individual governments would have policy independence checked by an outside world that was not friendly.NATURAL FORCES WILL PUSH WORLD TOWARDS ECONOMIC INTEGRATION With a new century coming, natural forces are going to keep pushing the world into economic integration that is going to offer a broad choice to governments. They can choose to put up a barricade, or they can just go along with the flow. Preparing for a single currency is going to ensure there are fewer pretend agreements on policy and there will be more real ones. There will be active promotion of the private sectors use of international money along with any national money that exists. It would mean that people would vote using their wallets for a move that would end up as a full currency union.\nIn 1998, ten years later, the Economist printed another article promoting globalist agendas, One World, One Money. This was similar to the piece they had written ten years prior, and it went on to try to explain why a more controlled and centralized system is going to be beneficial to the global economy, while at the same time ignoring that a centralized global currency is going to be a huge coup for international banking cartels. It will also be the bottom line, financially, for the banking empire of the Rothschild family.\nCreation of a single global currency is also going to give a great deal of geopolitical capital to international bankers that have not been elected, and it could take power away from the people of nations along with government representatives. But the question is whether or not anyone wants international bankers to have a huge amount of power, politically, on top of a lot of financial influence and the amount of sway they already have in power. People today want to have more say in their own lives and they do not want policy dictated by bureaucrats and bankers.The Rothschild family is keeping a profile that is very low in the public eye.\nHowever, they do still have many business operations, and these are spread out over a wide array of sectors. There is not any particular member of the Rothschild family seen on the richest list of Forbes, but the family is said to have control over more than 1 trillion dollars in assets worldwide. Therefore they do still have a voice that is strong over the entire geopolitical spectrum, and many see this as a hand that is hidden that manipulates events quietly in the background under a veil of secrecy.",

This Immediately if You Have Diabetes (Watch)</a></figcaption></figure></a></p>\n<p>As a result, radical Islamic terror cells have a pervasive presence in New York, Boston, Seattle, San Francisco, Orlando, Tucson and many other cities (see map below):</p>\n<p>The way these terror networks operate is by <em>fitting in with society</em> while waiting for the once-in-a-lifetime command to &ldquo;activate,&rdquo; at which point they carry out deadly attacks on various targets that would produce the highest casualties, via asymmetric warfare.</p>\n<p>In other words, these terror cells are your neighbors, your local dry cleaner owners, Uber drivers and retail workers. They&rsquo;re everyday people who have spent years embedding themselves in society, but their long-term goal is to destroy America by any means necessary, and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve trained to carry out.</p>\n<p>IRLI Executive Director Dale Wilcox chatted with SiriusXM Patriot&rsquo;s Breitbart News Tonight last week, warned that the 10,000 illegals from terrorist countries are a &ldquo;very dangerous situation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have 10,000 aliens &hellip; some of them are criminals and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve been ordered removed. You could have some that might have come into the country legally at some point. However, they&rsquo;ve committed crimes and they&rsquo;ve been ordered removed.</p>\n<p>Then of course you have your garden variety of illegal aliens who have jumped the border or overstayed a legitimate visa. And they&rsquo;ve been told to go home and yet they&rsquo;re continuing to hide out in this country which only stresses the danger of sanctuary jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>California has the largest population of Iranians outside of Iran. California is a sanctuary state. California is not cooperating with immigration authorities, so their sanctuary law is preventing ICE from removing these individuals. Of that number 10,000 &hellip; 6,000 of these individuals are Iranian. We&rsquo;ve had hearings here recently in Congress where U.S. intelligence officials have stated there are Iranian sleeper cells inside the United States, ready and waiting for the order.</p>\n<p>People have to understand how dangerous this is in these sanctuary cities because the first attack on the World Trade Center &hellip; the New York subway bombing conspiracy, and 9/11, all of these plots were perpetrated by immigration violators. This is a very dangerous situation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Despite the dozens of sanctuary cities protecting illegal aliens from deportation, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were able to deport about 44 illegal aliens in the last two fiscal years who were known or suspected terrorists.</p>\n<p><strong>Asymmetric warfare relies on population density to produce the highest casualties: CITIES are the death zones</strong></p>\n<p>First off, it&rsquo;s crucial to understand that all the targets will be found in cities, not rural areas. That&rsquo;s because asymmetric warfare needs high densities of human targets to achieve the desired goal of mass death. This simply cannot be achieved by attacking farms or rural residential areas.</p>\n<p>So if you&rsquo;re still living in a city for some reason, understand that you are now in the target zone for terror cell attacks. If you live in a city and don&rsquo;t have a plan to escape the city on foot, complete with emergency water filters, food and firearms, then you obviously have some sort of twisted death wish.</p>\n<p><strong>Vulnerable infrastructure is surprisingly easy for terrorists to destroy</strong></p>\n<p>The second point here is that America&rsquo;s infrastructure was not constructed with any real sense of making it resistant to domestic terrorism attacks. For example:</p>\n<ul> <li>Power grid substations are right out in the open and can be easily attacked with long range rifles from 1-2 miles away.</li> <li>Water deliver systems use open air canals and river sources that can be easily mass poisoned.</li> <li>Food deliveries can be easily disrupted or contaminated by targeting food distribution hubs.</li> <li>There are zero defenses right now against airborne biological, chemical or radiological weapons delivered via drones or even small planes.</li> <li>Fuel refineries can be easily targeted with mortars or long-range rifle fire.</li> <li>Improved explosives (or suicide vests) can be used to bomb large numbers of civilians who gather in public places such as concerts, subways or movie theaters.</li> <li>Biological weapons are undetectable and can be released almost anywhere, with zero traceability. Thanks to CRISPR gene editing technology, almost anyone can whip up a bioweapon in their own basement, with minimal funding or technical expertise.</li> </ul>\n<p>Thus, if Iran activates its terror cells across America, any rational person should fully expect to see disruptions in the power grid, water systems, food deliveries and fuel infrastructure.</p>\n<p>These disruptions may be localized and possibly short-lived, but if large scale attacks are coordinated among several cells, a city like Los Angeles, for example, could be brought to its knees with <em>simultaneous</em> disruptions of water, fuel, electricity and food.</p>\n<p>Given that some U.S. cities are already on the verge of collapsing into total chaos on any given day &mdash; L.A., Detroit, Chicago, Miami, etc. &mdash; it actually wouldn&rsquo;t take much to tip these cities into spiraling chaos and lawlessness.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Americans are not prepared for any disruptions at all, and they will panic</strong></p>\n<p>Making matters worse, America is a culture populated by hyper-privileged, entitled snowflakes who go into a panic when they misplace their cell phones. Most Americans have zero preparedness plans and think the idea of storing food for an emergency is &ldquo;tin foil hat crazy.&rdquo; Similarly, few Americans know where to find a backup supply of water or how to filter that water and make it safe to drink.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of Americans have no spare cash whatsoever &mdash; not even emergency money &mdash; and they have no means to defend themselves or live in any sustainable way that doesn&rsquo;t rely on constant artificial inputs from <em>outside</em> the cities. As I&rsquo;ve explained before, <strong>cities are artificial constructs</strong> that rely on a steady stream of food, electricity, fuel, bandwidth and water to survive. When any one of those is cut off, cities begin to rapidly collapse into chaos and panic.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that Iran&rsquo;s terror cells will be counting on this &ldquo;chaos factor&rdquo; when they plan their upcoming attacks. From their point of view, America is a weak culture of pathetic snowflakes who are easy to send into a panic because they live cushy, comfortable lives and have never faced real hardship like those who live in the Middle East. They&rsquo;re not entirely wrong in this assessment, by the way: The average American &mdash; with a few exceptions such as soldiers, fire fighters, police officers, EMTs, etc. &mdash; has never seen anything close to the carnage that will unfold when Iran activates a domestic war against America on U.S. soil.</p>\n<p>America has become weak. It&rsquo;s true. The snowflakian utopia of &ldquo;Libtardia&rdquo; has finally arrived.</p>\n<p><strong>America&rsquo;s stock market bubble is highly vulnerable to panic, since it&rsquo;s all running on perception, not financial reality</strong></p>\n<p>Another crucial point to understand in all this is how the bubble stock market could easily implode once the attacks begin on U.S. soil, since the entire market is now based on psychology rather than financial reality. Right now, people have &ldquo;faith&rdquo; in the market, and that &mdash; combined with some Fed pumping &mdash; is what&rsquo;s keeping the whole house of cards propped up. But the moment the suicide bombers start detonating themselves in malls, movie theaters and train stations, guess what happens to all that &ldquo;faith&rdquo; in the minds of the average American retail investor? It <em>vanishes</em>.</p>\n<p>Thus, Iran quite literally has the power to initiate a market crash that could indirectly take out Trump by causing him to lose the next election. That&rsquo;s on top of the $80 million bounty on Trump&rsquo;s head that has already been announced by Iran&rsquo;s leadership. (Should Kathy Griffin claim the reward already?)</p>\n<p>If you ever needed a good reason to get out of the stock market bubble, add this one to your list. The moment the terror cells go active in America, the market becomes highly vulnerable to <em>fear</em>, which immediately replaces the irrational exuberance that&rsquo;s currently driving the market.</p>\n<p><strong>Likely weapons: Mortars, suicide vests, mass shootings, drone attacks and more</strong></p>\n<p>As a real-world example of how easy it is to acquire weapons of mass destruction in America &mdash; even by accident &mdash; a few years ago I was purchasing surplus lab equipment from Michigan State University. They shipped me a piece of used equipment that was full of liquid mercury&hellip; enough mercury to poison the entire water supply of Los Angeles, it turns out. I wasn&rsquo;t even trying to purchase mercury and had no idea the machine was full of the toxic substance.</p>\n<p>Oh, and in case you&rsquo;re curious, they packed the instrument in bubble wrap and threw it in a cardboard box that turned out to be <strong>heavily contaminated with tiny mercury spheres</strong> from the moment I opened it. So Michigan State University managed to poison the UPS workers with mercury, too, while contaminating UPS trucks and everything else that was encountered along the way. (On the good side, Michigan State University apologized to me and paid for a hazmat cleanup team to pick up the mercury and dispose of it, which probably means they dumped it in the river or something, who knows&hellip;)</p>\n<p>Imagine what a terrorist could acquire if they were actually <em>trying</em> to buy up lots of mercury, or hexavalent chromium, or some other toxic chemical that&rsquo;s sold as an agricultural pesticide. It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius terrorist to dump a hundred gallons of highly toxic chemicals into the water supply feeding Los Angeles&hellip; or Tucson, for that matter, since much of southern Arizona is fed by open air water canals.</p>\n<p>Then again, the lunatic Americans who work in water treatment facilities are dumping toxic fluoride into the water supply every day, carrying out a government-approved mass poisoning of the population, even without help from terror cells. So it&rsquo;s true that there has been chemical terrorism under way in America for decades, especially when you consider the scourge of biosludge and the mass poisoning of America&rsquo;s farms with &ldquo;recycled&rdquo; toxic human sewage.</p>\n<p>In addition to these chemical contamination vectors, terror cells may also resort to old tried-and-true tactics such as wearing a suicide vest and detonating in the middle of a Sunday crowd in San Francisco. They might also target refineries and fuel storage tanks near Houston with mortar fire or long-range rifle fire. Mass shootings might also be carried out against large crowds of people, similar to the Las Vegas shooting that we&rsquo;ll never forget, since that entire fiasco was immediately covered up by the treasonous FBI and local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>If you ever needed a reason to become more self-sufficient and remove yourself from the grid as much as possible, now you&rsquo;ve got one. Even hanging out with crowds of people at public events may become a risky activity once the terror cells activate. If you thought terrorists bombing public buses and sidewalk cafes was limited to the Israel / Palestine conflict, think again: Iran may bring those same tactics to America.</p>\n<p><strong>Over 90% of Americans have no idea how to use a tourniquet and have never taken a fighting pistol course</strong></p>\n<p>The vast majority of Americans have no idea how to use a tourniquet, and this fact should be alarming when you consider the possibility of bombings that might target U.S. cities. Almost no one <em>carries</em> a spare tourniquet, not even in their vehicles.</p>\n<p>Personally, I carry blood stop devices, puncture wound treatment devices and even a chest vent seal, and that&rsquo;s on top of the multiple tourniquets in my vehicle, plus one on my person. I&rsquo;ve practiced how to apply a tourniquet with one hand, and how to shoot, clear jams and reload a pistol with either hand. These are simple skills, yet over 99% of Americans have not even practiced them at all. In effect, the American people are <strong>highly vulnerable</strong> to acts of terrorism because Americans have become weak and comfortable, for the most part. They no longer have a survival mindset, and their real-world skills are practically non-existent except for certain classes of individuals that I mentioned above, such as cops, fire fighters, EMTs, police officers and even truckers &mdash; people who have seen the real world and don&rsquo;t like in liberal bubbles like Twitter and Facebook.</p>\n<p><strong>Things you really need to get done in 2020, hopefully before the bombings begin</strong></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve never taken a pistol or rifle training course, make 2020 your year to get that done. TacticalResponse.com offers courses in select cities across the country, and you can also check your local community for firearms instruction that goes beyond the basics of concealed carry.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve never practiced stuffing a bullet wound with gauze, sticking tampons into puncture wounds, or stopping bleeding from lacerations and knife wounds, then you&rsquo;re not prepared for America in the 2020s. Just ask the New York Jews, who are now under constant attack from radical Islamic nut jobs who have been emboldened by the insane left-wing media that now claims <em>Islamic</em> terrorism is caused by &ldquo;white supremacy,&rdquo; somehow.</p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t yet own a good pistol, a rifle, some spare ammo and some high-end colloidal silver gel, you&rsquo;re not ready for the reality of what has just been unleashed. If you don&rsquo;t own a water filter, some stored food and some emergency communications gear, you&rsquo;re hopelessly unprepared for the new future we now share.</p>\n<p>You are now living in &ldquo;Battlefield America,&rdquo; and the war will be brought here this calendar year. In fact, Iran and Barack Obama have both worked toward this for a very long time. It&rsquo;s Obama&rsquo;s billions of dollars in laundered money delivered to Iran, after all, that helped fund this war on America. And <strong>all the Democrats are rooting for the Islamic terrorists</strong>, in case you haven&rsquo;t noticed. Their mask has come off, and Democrats are now 100% in alignment with radical Islam when it comes to hating America and hoping for America&rsquo;s total destruction.</p>\n<p>via:</p>\n<p>Natualnews.com / zerohedge</p>",

                "text": "Approximately 10,000 illegal immigrants from countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism are living within the borders of the United States, according to the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI), first reported by Breitbart.\nIRLI revealed last week that it had obtained documents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) that revealed that the 10,000 illegals have not yet been deported despite having been ordered to leave the country.\nThe FOIA showed the illegals were from Iran, Syria, Sudan, and North Korea.\nIRLI said Iran \u201cled the pack with over 6,000 or 61% of their citizens with removal orders followed by Syria with 20%, Sudan with 18%, and North Korea with less than a percent.\u201d\nAds by Revcontent\nCongress has recently held hearings where U.S. intelligence officials have suggested that Iranian sleeper cells inside the U.S. are awaiting orders to strike.\nAs the map shows below, Islamic terrorist networks have been in place for years. What most Americans don\u2019t yet fully realize is that Barack Obama helped fund these terror networks through a complex international money laundering scheme that delivered over $150 billion to Iran during the Obama administration. At least $1 billion went to fund Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program, with full knowledge from Obama. (Obama also helped Iran capture a U.S. drone and two Navy boats in order to give Iran U.S. military encryption technology.)\nAs a result, radical Islamic terror cells have a pervasive presence in New York, Boston, Seattle, San Francisco, Orlando, Tucson and many other cities (see map below):\nThe way these terror networks operate is by fitting in with society while waiting for the once-in-a-lifetime command to \u201cactivate,\u201d at which point they carry out deadly attacks on various targets that would produce the highest casualties, via asymmetric warfare.\nIn other words, these terror cells are your neighbors, your local dry cleaner owners, Uber drivers and retail workers. They\u2019re everyday people who have spent years embedding themselves in society, but their long-term goal is to destroy America by any means necessary, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve trained to carry out.\nIRLI Executive Director Dale Wilcox chatted with SiriusXM Patriot\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight last week, warned that the 10,000 illegals from terrorist countries are a \u201cvery dangerous situation.\u201d\n\u201cWe have 10,000 aliens \u2026 some of them are criminals and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been ordered removed. You could have some that might have come into the country legally at some point. However, they\u2019ve committed crimes and they\u2019ve been ordered removed.\nThen of course you have your garden variety of illegal aliens who have jumped the border or overstayed a legitimate visa. And they\u2019ve been told to go home and yet they\u2019re continuing to hide out in this country which only stresses the danger of sanctuary jurisdictions.\nCalifornia has the largest population of Iranians outside of Iran. California is a sanctuary state. California is not cooperating with immigration authorities, so their sanctuary law is preventing ICE from removing these individuals. Of that number 10,000 \u2026 6,000 of these individuals are Iranian. We\u2019ve had hearings here recently in Congress where U.S. intelligence officials have stated there are Iranian sleeper cells inside the United States, ready and waiting for the order.\nPeople have to understand how dangerous this is in these sanctuary cities because the first attack on the World Trade Center \u2026 the New York subway bombing conspiracy, and 9/11, all of these plots were perpetrated by immigration violators. This is a very dangerous situation.\u201d\nDespite the dozens of sanctuary cities protecting illegal aliens from deportation, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were able to deport about 44 illegal aliens in the last two fiscal years who were known or suspected terrorists.\nAsymmetric warfare relies on population density to produce the highest casualties: CITIES are the death zones\nFirst off, it\u2019s crucial to understand that all the targets will be found in cities, not rural areas. That\u2019s because asymmetric warfare needs high densities of human targets to achieve the desired goal of mass death. This simply cannot be achieved by attacking farms or rural residential areas.\nSo if you\u2019re still living in a city for some reason, understand that you are now in the target zone for terror cell attacks. If you live in a city and don\u2019t have a plan to escape the city on foot, complete with emergency water filters, food and firearms, then you obviously have some sort of twisted death wish.\nVulnerable infrastructure is surprisingly easy for terrorists to destroy\nThe second point here is that America\u2019s infrastructure was not constructed with any real sense of making it resistant to domestic terrorism attacks. For example:\nPower grid substations are right out in the open and can be easily attacked with long range rifles from 1-2 miles away.\nWater deliver systems use open air canals and river sources that can be easily mass poisoned.\nFood deliveries can be easily disrupted or contaminated by targeting food distribution hubs.\nThere are zero defenses right now against airborne biological, chemical or radiological weapons delivered via drones or even small planes.\nFuel refineries can be easily targeted with mortars or long-range rifle fire.\nImproved explosives (or suicide vests) can be used to bomb large numbers of civilians who gather in public places such as concerts, subways or movie theaters.\nBiological weapons are undetectable and can be released almost anywhere, with zero traceability. Thanks to CRISPR gene editing technology, almost anyone can whip up a bioweapon in their own basement, with minimal funding or technical expertise.\nThus, if Iran activates its terror cells across America, any rational person should fully expect to see disruptions in the power grid, water systems, food deliveries and fuel infrastructure.\nThese disruptions may be localized and possibly short-lived, but if large scale attacks are coordinated among several cells, a city like Los Angeles, for example, could be brought to its knees with simultaneous disruptions of water, fuel, electricity and food.\nGiven that some U.S. cities are already on the verge of collapsing into total chaos on any given day \u2014 L.A., Detroit, Chicago, Miami, etc. \u2014 it actually wouldn\u2019t take much to tip these cities into spiraling chaos and lawlessness.\nMost Americans are not prepared for any disruptions at all, and they will panic\nMaking matters worse, America is a culture populated by hyper-privileged, entitled snowflakes who go into a panic when they misplace their cell phones. Most Americans have zero preparedness plans and think the idea of storing food for an emergency is \u201ctin foil hat crazy.\u201d Similarly, few Americans know where to find a backup supply of water or how to filter that water and make it safe to drink.\nThe vast majority of Americans have no spare cash whatsoever \u2014 not even emergency money \u2014 and they have no means to defend themselves or live in any sustainable way that doesn\u2019t rely on constant artificial inputs from outside the cities. As I\u2019ve explained before, cities are artificial constructs that rely on a steady stream of food, electricity, fuel, bandwidth and water to survive. When any one of those is cut off, cities begin to rapidly collapse into chaos and panic.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Iran\u2019s terror cells will be counting on this \u201cchaos factor\u201d when they plan their upcoming attacks. From their point of view, America is a weak culture of pathetic snowflakes who are easy to send into a panic because they live cushy, comfortable lives and have never faced real hardship like those who live in the Middle East. They\u2019re not entirely wrong in this assessment, by the way: The average American \u2014 with a few exceptions such as soldiers, fire fighters, police officers, EMTs, etc. \u2014 has never seen anything close to the carnage that will unfold when Iran activates a domestic war against America on U.S. soil.\nAmerica has become weak. It\u2019s true. The snowflakian utopia of \u201cLibtardia\u201d has finally arrived.\nAmerica\u2019s stock market bubble is highly vulnerable to panic, since it\u2019s all running on perception, not financial reality\nAnother crucial point to understand in all this is how the bubble stock market could easily implode once the attacks begin on U.S. soil, since the entire market is now based on psychology rather than financial reality. Right now, people have \u201cfaith\u201d in the market, and that \u2014 combined with some Fed pumping \u2014 is what\u2019s keeping the whole house of cards propped up. But the moment the suicide bombers start detonating themselves in malls, movie theaters and train stations, guess what happens to all that \u201cfaith\u201d in the minds of the average American retail investor? It vanishes.\nThus, Iran quite literally has the power to initiate a market crash that could indirectly take out Trump by causing him to lose the next election. That\u2019s on top of the $80 million bounty on Trump\u2019s head that has already been announced by Iran\u2019s leadership. (Should Kathy Griffin claim the reward already?)\nIf you ever needed a good reason to get out of the stock market bubble, add this one to your list. The moment the terror cells go active in America, the market becomes highly vulnerable to fear, which immediately replaces the irrational exuberance that\u2019s currently driving the market.\nLikely weapons: Mortars, suicide vests, mass shootings, drone attacks and more\nAs a real-world example of how easy it is to acquire weapons of mass destruction in America \u2014 even by accident \u2014 a few years ago I was purchasing surplus lab equipment from Michigan State University. They shipped me a piece of used equipment that was full of liquid mercury\u2026 enough mercury to poison the entire water supply of Los Angeles, it turns out. I wasn\u2019t even trying to purchase mercury and had no idea the machine was full of the toxic substance.\nOh, and in case you\u2019re curious, they packed the instrument in bubble wrap and threw it in a cardboard box that turned out to be heavily contaminated with tiny mercury spheres from the moment I opened it. So Michigan State University managed to poison the UPS workers with mercury, too, while contaminating UPS trucks and everything else that was encountered along the way. (On the good side, Michigan State University apologized to me and paid for a hazmat cleanup team to pick up the mercury and dispose of it, which probably means they dumped it in the river or something, who knows\u2026)\nImagine what a terrorist could acquire if they were actually trying to buy up lots of mercury, or hexavalent chromium, or some other toxic chemical that\u2019s sold as an agricultural pesticide. It doesn\u2019t take a genius terrorist to dump a hundred gallons of highly toxic chemicals into the water supply feeding Los Angeles\u2026 or Tucson, for that matter, since much of southern Arizona is fed by open air water canals.\nThen again, the lunatic Americans who work in water treatment facilities are dumping toxic fluoride into the water supply every day, carrying out a government-approved mass poisoning of the population, even without help from terror cells. So it\u2019s true that there has been chemical terrorism under way in America for decades, especially when you consider the scourge of biosludge and the mass poisoning of America\u2019s farms with \u201crecycled\u201d toxic human sewage.\nIn addition to these chemical contamination vectors, terror cells may also resort to old tried-and-true tactics such as wearing a suicide vest and detonating in the middle of a Sunday crowd in San Francisco. They might also target refineries and fuel storage tanks near Houston with mortar fire or long-range rifle fire. Mass shootings might also be carried out against large crowds of people, similar to the Las Vegas shooting that we\u2019ll never forget, since that entire fiasco was immediately covered up by the treasonous FBI and local law enforcement.\nIf you ever needed a reason to become more self-sufficient and remove yourself from the grid as much as possible, now you\u2019ve got one. Even hanging out with crowds of people at public events may become a risky activity once the terror cells activate. If you thought terrorists bombing public buses and sidewalk cafes was limited to the Israel / Palestine conflict, think again: Iran may bring those same tactics to America.\nOver 90% of Americans have no idea how to use a tourniquet and have never taken a fighting pistol course\nThe vast majority of Americans have no idea how to use a tourniquet, and this fact should be alarming when you consider the possibility of bombings that might target U.S. cities. Almost no one carries a spare tourniquet, not even in their vehicles.\nPersonally, I carry blood stop devices, puncture wound treatment devices and even a chest vent seal, and that\u2019s on top of the multiple tourniquets in my vehicle, plus one on my person. I\u2019ve practiced how to apply a tourniquet with one hand, and how to shoot, clear jams and reload a pistol with either hand. These are simple skills, yet over 99% of Americans have not even practiced them at all. In effect, the American people are highly vulnerable to acts of terrorism because Americans have become weak and comfortable, for the most part. They no longer have a survival mindset, and their real-world skills are practically non-existent except for certain classes of individuals that I mentioned above, such as cops, fire fighters, EMTs, police officers and even truckers \u2014 people who have seen the real world and don\u2019t like in liberal bubbles like Twitter and Facebook.\nThings you really need to get done in 2020, hopefully before the bombings begin\nIf you\u2019ve never taken a pistol or rifle training course, make 2020 your year to get that done. TacticalResponse.com offers courses in select cities across the country, and you can also check your local community for firearms instruction that goes beyond the basics of concealed carry.\nIf you\u2019ve never practiced stuffing a bullet wound with gauze, sticking tampons into puncture wounds, or stopping bleeding from lacerations and knife wounds, then you\u2019re not prepared for America in the 2020s. Just ask the New York Jews, who are now under constant attack from radical Islamic nut jobs who have been emboldened by the insane left-wing media that now claims Islamic terrorism is caused by \u201cwhite supremacy,\u201d somehow.\nIf you don\u2019t yet own a good pistol, a rifle, some spare ammo and some high-end colloidal silver gel, you\u2019re not ready for the reality of what has just been unleashed. If you don\u2019t own a water filter, some stored food and some emergency communications gear, you\u2019re hopelessly unprepared for the new future we now share.\nYou are now living in \u201cBattlefield America,\u201d and the war will be brought here this calendar year. In fact, Iran and Barack Obama have both worked toward this for a very long time. It\u2019s Obama\u2019s billions of dollars in laundered money delivered to Iran, after all, that helped fund this war on America. And all the Democrats are rooting for the Islamic terrorists, in case you haven\u2019t noticed. Their mask has come off, and Democrats are now 100% in alignment with radical Islam when it comes to hating America and hoping for America\u2019s total destruction.\nvia:\nNatualnews.com / zerohedge",

hand; there shall not be a man of them stand before thee.&rdquo; (Joshua 10:8).</p>\n<p>Joshua was concerned because the enemy had surrounded him, and if darkness fell, they would overpower him. So Joshua asked the Lord to make the sun stand still! That&rsquo;s right &ndash; &ldquo;And the sun stood still and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.</p>\n<p>Is this not written in the book of Ja&rsquo;-sher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole<br>\n day.&rdquo; (Joshua 10:13).</p>\n<p>The astronauts and scientists said: &rdquo; There is the missing day!&rdquo; They checked the computers g</p>\n<p>oing back into the time it was written and found it, but it was not close enough. The elapsed time that was missing back in Joshua&rsquo;s day was 23 hours and 20 minutes &ndash; not a whole day.</p>\n<p>They read the Bible again and there it was: &ldquo;about (approximately) a day.&rdquo; These little words in the Bible were important, but they were still in trouble, because another 40 minutes were still unaccounted for, and this could mean trouble 1000 years from now.</p>\n<p>Forty minutes had to be found because it can be multiplied many times over in orbits. As the Christian employee thought about it, he remembered somewhere in the Bible which said the sun went backwards. The scientists told him he was out of his mind, but once again they opened the Book and read these words in 2<br>\n Kings. Hezekiah, on his deathbed, was visited by the prophet, Isaiah, who told him he was not going to die. Hezekiah asked for some sign as proof. Isaiah said: &ldquo;Shall the sun go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And Hezekiah answered: &ldquo;It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees; nay, but let the shadow return backwards ten degrees.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord, and He brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.&rdquo; (2 Kings 20:9 -11). Ten degrees is exactly 40 minutes! Twenty-three hours and twenty minutes in Joshua, plus 40 minutes in 2 Kings accounted for the missing day in the universe!</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KMd-5MVF_E\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "For all you scientists out there and for all the students who have had a hard time convincing these people regarding the truth of the Bible \u2013 here\u2019s something that illustrates God\u2019s awesome creation and shows He is still in control.\nDid you know that NASA\u2019s space programmers are busy proving that was has been called \u2018myth\u2019 in the Bible is true? Mr. Harold Hill, President of the Curtis engine Company in Baltimore, and a consultant in the space programmers, relates the following incident: \u201cOne of the most amazing things that God has for us today happened recently to our astronauts and space scientists at Green Belt, Maryland.\nThey were checking out the positions of the sun, moon and planets out in space where they would be 100, and 1000 years from now. We have to know this as we do not want a satellite to collide with any of these in its orbits. We have to lay out the orbits in terms of the life of the satellite and where the planets will be so the whole project will not bog down.\nComputer measurements and data were run back and forth over the centuries when suddenly it came to a halt, displaying a red signal, which meant that either there was something wrong with the information fed into it, or with the results as compared to the standards.\nThey called in the service department to check it out, and the technicians asked what was wrong. The scientists had discovered that somewhere in space in elapsed time a day was missing. Nobody seemed able to come up with a solution to the problem. Finally one of the team, a Christian, said: \u201cYou know, when I was still in Sunday School, they spoke about the sun standing still\u2026\u201d While his colleagues didn\u2019t believe him, they did not have an answer either, so they said: \u201cShow us.\u201d He got a Bible and opened it at the book of Joshua where they found a pretty ridiculous statement for any one with \u2018common sense\u2019.\nThere they read about the Lord saying to Joshua: \u201cFear them not, I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not be a man of them stand before thee.\u201d (Joshua 10:8).\nJoshua was concerned because the enemy had surrounded him, and if darkness fell, they would overpower him. So Joshua asked the Lord to make the sun stand still! That\u2019s right \u2013 \u201cAnd the sun stood still and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.\nIs this not written in the book of Ja\u2019-sher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole\nday.\u201d (Joshua 10:13).\nThe astronauts and scientists said: \u201d There is the missing day!\u201d They checked the computers g\noing back into the time it was written and found it, but it was not close enough. The elapsed time that was missing back in Joshua\u2019s day was 23 hours and 20 minutes \u2013 not a whole day.\nThey read the Bible again and there it was: \u201cabout (approximately) a day.\u201d These little words in the Bible were important, but they were still in trouble, because another 40 minutes were still unaccounted for, and this could mean trouble 1000 years from now.\nForty minutes had to be found because it can be multiplied many times over in orbits. As the Christian employee thought about it, he remembered somewhere in the Bible which said the sun went backwards. The scientists told him he was out of his mind, but once again they opened the Book and read these words in 2\nKings. Hezekiah, on his deathbed, was visited by the prophet, Isaiah, who told him he was not going to die. Hezekiah asked for some sign as proof. Isaiah said: \u201cShall the sun go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?\u201d\nAnd Hezekiah answered: \u201cIt is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees; nay, but let the shadow return backwards ten degrees.\u201d\nAnd Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord, and He brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.\u201d (2 Kings 20:9 -11). Ten degrees is exactly 40 minutes! Twenty-three hours and twenty minutes in Joshua, plus 40 minutes in 2 Kings accounted for the missing day in the universe!",

One company thinks so, and they&rsquo;re planning to unveil a scaled-down version of their proposal later this year.</p>\n<p>Called &ldquo;The Immortus,&rdquo; the two-person vehicle is the work of EVX Ventures, an electric vehicle technology startup based in Melbourne, Australia. The car is decked out in solar panels, covering up to eight square meters (86 square feet), and also has a lithium battery to store energy, between five and 10 kilowatt-hours. So light is the car though, 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) when empty and 700 kilograms (1,550 pounds) when fully laden, it is able to run on just solar power alone.</p>\n<p>This is all possible thanks to the low mass-to-power ratio of the car. It is also extremely aerodynamic while still looking &ldquo;compelling and stylish,&rdquo; EVX co-founder and CEO Barry Nguyen said to IFLScience. The car also doesn&rsquo;t use normal road tires, but rather tires specially designed for so-called <a href=\"http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/\">&ldquo;solar racers&rdquo;</a> &ndash; cars that are powered by the Sun.</p>\n<p><a data-delivery=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=ILYkQkeR7OHjg8UANPN%2B1NuRjfzrsfNxF3OTLolNWkW7mXgmXNoT1z2uNIbC171D9qtmuxbB1SouudfD%2FEifCZkABsFxFMe88fBn6vF%2FEKGDv%2F%2F9YZFkWT1GXqewmxhoA1LgKEBYYfs35n9PvnHSxAzKmPqv3JFBhzSiLJM7XBtz3Q9G1to44WsD%2B1%2BMTLNbhVX3VM5fuFcm7wRyaNUgucChwVBkEgF%2Focgf0UnZTsSg4mZxBZW1EckTaFPfqDWLgU8kTWgce9Q4FCWMmQZvSDf9IaAFSWZrOK5d1jWNW%2F%2FvAekaEqUfBGZvoLwFsy68xt1FO1dHBqCjDgDhzaHZGIaS3tGfHc%2F2GZREVKEwzcjLdPujD%2Bi02jwvjijRizNXDweujxbJNU9Stbn%2FGz1MjwNxXrZnQ3d2lkdY7VV2l0BXAhGrb8hQUfufsNJwwLiQvpdZQ62Mf%2FsyWEa%2BXjLrOG8sW8GuWsB%2BcHM1IdLD6%2FHOGO2sPRohG%2BFYFWsEDckMIkpM1SLWmzjaQHM8nVw8gv3X2KRTrdE6UFP5lko5%2FwVJZdQK1DwZWOLFifDZ70vJl0Lx4Pn2f3nQ5NHCpYg1ruK8YYN%2FYKdKt8dqC1Oric1MuotC7%2BR9vzfEkJZB1skvC%2FyqVAeWW9%2F%2Fd9yzgi4YrJT5EfBKUshQDz8SvoZTB03DDcysPhsebCPkggQxTKaA1BJTVc3yo9HOQp0BYoxnHXS3NAYyiD1pEuha56jhoQtcnKucsOjpNFKEwYtswvK%2BefajWl83xbf%2FcQsQzXvSxJvHsFwfAwOhgNZWVMc0E928qOPAcc%2FPBNeno%2FtqzGqXdM%2Few%2F0guXRUBJoviCexihBLbY9z7RQqYueAaJ%2BQEung%2BC332xw2sqJx0%2FlLvAUSHOK73e3WEhrmKoFOD5ev4sagNvKxYv5FedlYFYrgbh7b%2FNsKl2PB%2FrnlNvdk4%2FuW9JqaxVlygdrUzWSnrInhUMh%2BH%2B2nVdhOwzkyamrgkAZWX8y2Lv6avF3kGqb%2FmWcN&s2s=1\" data-id=\"ILYkQkeR7OHjg8UANPN%2B1NuRjfzrsfNxF3OTLolNWkW7mXgmXNoT1z2uNIbC171D9qtmuxbB1SouudfD%2FEifCZkABsFxFMe88fBn6vF%2FEKGDv%2F%2F9YZFkWT1GXqewmxhoA1LgKEBYYfs35n9PvnHSxAzKmPqv3JFBhzSiLJM7XBtz3Q9G1to44WsD%2B1%2BMTLNbhVX3VM5fuFcm7wRyaNUgucChwVBkEgF%2Focgf0UnZTsSg4mZxBZW1EckTaFPfqDWLgU8kTWgce9Q4FCWMmQZvSDf9IaAFSWZrOK5d1jWNW%2F%2FvAekaEqUfBGZvoLwFsy68xt1FO1dHBqCjDgDhzaHZGIaS3tGfHc%2F2GZREVKEwzcjLdPujD%2Bi02jwvjijRizNXDweujxbJNU9Stbn%2FGz1MjwNxXrZnQ3d2lkdY7VV2l0BXAhGrb8hQUfufsNJwwLiQvpdZQ62Mf%2FsyWEa%2BXjLrOG8sW8GuWsB%2BcHM1IdLD6%2FHOGO2sPRohG%2BFYFWsEDckMIkpM1SLWmzjaQHM8nVw8gv3X2KRTrdE6UFP5lko5%2FwVJZdQK1DwZWOLFifDZ70vJl0Lx4Pn2f3nQ5NHCpYg1ruK8YYN%2FYKdKt8dqC1Oric1MuotC7%2BR9vzfEkJZB1skvC%2FyqVAeWW9%2F%2Fd9yzgi4YrJT5EfBKUshQDz8SvoZTB03DDcysPhsebCPkggQxTKaA1BJTVc3yo9HOQp0BYoxnHXS3NAYyiD1pEuha56jhoQtcnKucsOjpNFKEwYtswvK%2BefajWl83xbf%2FcQsQzXvSxJvHsFwfAwOhgNZWVMc0E928qOPAcc%2FPBNeno%2FtqzGqXdM%2Few%2F0guXRUBJoviCexihBLbY9z7RQqYueAaJ%2BQEung%2BC332xw2sqJx0%2FlLvAUSHOK73e3WEhrmKoFOD5ev4sagNvKxYv5FedlYFYrgbh7b%2FNsKl2PB%2FrnlNvdk4%2FuW9JqaxVlygdrUzWSnrInhUMh%2BH%2B2nVdhOwzkyamrgkAZWX8y2Lv6avF3kGqb%2FmWcN\" data-target=\"https://pro.oxfordclub.com/m/1356476?rev_campaign_id=613580\" href=\"https://trends.revcontent.com/click.php?d=ILYkQkeR7OHjg8UANPN%2B1NuRjfzrsfNxF3OTLolNWkW7mXgmXNoT1z2uNIbC171D9qtmuxbB1SouudfD%2FEifCZkABsFxFMe88fBn6vF%2FEKGDv%2F%2F9YZFkWT1GXqewmxhoA1LgKEBYYfs35n9PvnHSxAzKmPqv3JFBhzSiLJM7XBtz3Q9G1to44WsD%2B1%2BMTLNbhVX3VM5fuFcm7wRyaNUgucChwVBkEgF%2Focgf0UnZTsSg4mZxBZW1EckTaFPfqDWLgU8kTWgce9Q4FCWMmQZvSDf9IaAFSWZrOK5d1jWNW%2F%2FvAekaEqUfBGZvoLwFsy68xt1FO1dHBqCjDgDhzaHZGIaS3tGfHc%2F2GZREVKEwzcjLdPujD%2Bi02jwvjijRizNXDweujxbJNU9Stbn%2FGz1MjwNxXrZnQ3d2lkdY7VV2l0BXAhGrb8hQUfufsNJwwLiQvpdZQ62Mf%2FsyWEa%2BXjLrOG8sW8GuWsB%2BcHM1IdLD6%2FHOGO2sPRohG%2BFYFWsEDckMIkpM1SLWmzjaQHM8nVw8gv3X2KRTrdE6UFP5lko5%2FwVJZdQK1DwZWOLFifDZ70vJl0Lx4Pn2f3nQ5NHCpYg1ruK8YYN%2FYKdKt8dqC1Oric1MuotC7%2BR9vzfEkJZB1skvC%2FyqVAeWW9%2F%2Fd9yzgi4YrJT5EfBKUshQDz8SvoZTB03DDcysPhsebCPkggQxTKaA1BJTVc3yo9HOQp0BYoxnHXS3NAYyiD1pEuha56jhoQtcnKucsOjpNFKEwYtswvK%2BefajWl83xbf%2FcQsQzXvSxJvHsFwfAwOhgNZWVMc0E928qOPAcc%2FPBNeno%2FtqzGqXdM%2Few%2F0guXRUBJoviCexihBLbY9z7RQqYueAaJ%2BQEung%2BC332xw2sqJx0%2FlLvAUSHOK73e3WEhrmKoFOD5ev4sagNvKxYv5FedlYFYrgbh7b%2FNsKl2PB%2FrnlNvdk4%2FuW9JqaxVlygdrUzWSnrInhUMh%2BH%2B2nVdhOwzkyamrgkAZWX8y2Lv6avF3kGqb%2FmWcN&s2s=1\"><figure><video src=\"https://videos.revcontent.com/revcontent/video/upload/c_pad,h_240,w_426,b_blurred:400,f_mp4/v1579628040/revcontent-p0/cr_videos/9597/4213758.mp4\"> </video></figure></a></p>\n<p>Using a combination of battery and solar power, the car will apparently be capable of reaching up to 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour. On solar power alone, it can reach up to 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour.</p>\n<p>And perhaps most interestingly, Nguyen said that the car would be able to run perpetually on just solar power, giving it an infinite range, in theory, so long as it didn&rsquo;t exceed 60 kilometers (37 miles) per hour and the Sun was continuously shining. Still, that&rsquo;s pretty impressive. However, Nguyen stressed that the idea of the technology was to use solar cells in tandem with existing vehicles.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We see the solar cells as a range extender technology in everyday driving, rather than the solar cells capturing more energy than it consumes for practical use,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;However, uniquely, the range is infinite when there is consistent sunshine cruising at 60 km/h.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>EVX plans to unveil a one-quarter scaled version of their car at the <a href=\"http://www.semashow.com/the-sema-show\">SEMA Show 2015</a> at the Las Vegas Convention Center in November. A leading electric vehicle research and development group at the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne is also involved in the project.</p>\n<p>When it is eventually released, Nguyen said the car is expected to retail for about $370,000 (&pound;240,000), and sales of more than 100 are not expected. The car will be road legal &ldquo;under individually constructed vehicle regulations&rdquo; in Australia and the U.S., according to Nguyen.</p>\n<p>The team plans to test a full-scale version of the car by the end of 2016, providing they can raise enough money for a working prototype.</p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong></p>\n<p>iflscience.com</p>",

                "text": "Can a road-legal car be powered by the Sun alone? One company thinks so, and they\u2019re planning to unveil a scaled-down version of their proposal later this year.\nCalled \u201cThe Immortus,\u201d the two-person vehicle is the work of EVX Ventures, an electric vehicle technology startup based in Melbourne, Australia. The car is decked out in solar panels, covering up to eight square meters (86 square feet), and also has a lithium battery to store energy, between five and 10 kilowatt-hours. So light is the car though, 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) when empty and 700 kilograms (1,550 pounds) when fully laden, it is able to run on just solar power alone.\nThis is all possible thanks to the low mass-to-power ratio of the car. It is also extremely aerodynamic while still looking \u201ccompelling and stylish,\u201d EVX co-founder and CEO Barry Nguyen said to IFLScience. The car also doesn\u2019t use normal road tires, but rather tires specially designed for so-called \u201csolar racers\u201d \u2013 cars that are powered by the Sun.\nUsing a combination of battery and solar power, the car will apparently be capable of reaching up to 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour. On solar power alone, it can reach up to 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour.\nAnd perhaps most interestingly, Nguyen said that the car would be able to run perpetually on just solar power, giving it an infinite range, in theory, so long as it didn\u2019t exceed 60 kilometers (37 miles) per hour and the Sun was continuously shining. Still, that\u2019s pretty impressive. However, Nguyen stressed that the idea of the technology was to use solar cells in tandem with existing vehicles.\n\u201cWe see the solar cells as a range extender technology in everyday driving, rather than the solar cells capturing more energy than it consumes for practical use,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, uniquely, the range is infinite when there is consistent sunshine cruising at 60 km/h.\u201d\nEVX plans to unveil a one-quarter scaled version of their car at the SEMA Show 2015 at the Las Vegas Convention Center in November. A leading electric vehicle research and development group at the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne is also involved in the project.\nWhen it is eventually released, Nguyen said the car is expected to retail for about $370,000 (\u00a3240,000), and sales of more than 100 are not expected. The car will be road legal \u201cunder individually constructed vehicle regulations\u201d in Australia and the U.S., according to Nguyen.\nThe team plans to test a full-scale version of the car by the end of 2016, providing they can raise enough money for a working prototype.\nSource:\niflscience.com",

I said, I&rsquo;m tired of being, as a white male, blamed for everything that&rsquo;s wrong in the world. So now I want you to call me Loretta. I&rsquo;m a black lesbian in transition.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That all comes from &lsquo;Life of Brian,&rsquo; when Eric, whose name is Stan, says &lsquo;I want you to call me Loretta.

I said, I\u2019m tired of being, as a white male, blamed for everything that\u2019s wrong in the world. So now I want you to call me Loretta. I\u2019m a black lesbian in transition.\n\u201cThat all comes from \u2018Life of Brian,\u2019 when Eric, whose name is Stan, says \u2018I want you to call me Loretta. I want to be a woman,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cPeople now might take offense at that. And when offense becomes so easy, it takes the fun out of offending!\u201d\nMr. Gilliam also lamented that political correctness and \u201cegotism\u201d had changed comedy in the U.K. and the U.S.\n\u201cI always felt the British are very good at laughing at themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Americans are better at laughing at other people. I still think it\u2019s pretty true, but it\u2019s changing because now we can\u2019t laugh at anybody because it causes offense. There\u2019s a kind of egotism out there: \u2018Oh, they were making fun of me.\u2019 Never heard of you. I\u2019m making fun of an idea.\u201d",

Barr&rsquo;s top-line findings that there was no conspiracy with <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/\">Russia</a> to subvert the 2016 presidential election and not enough evidence to pursue an obstruction of justice case.</p>\n<p>But the sprawling nature of the 22-month investigation is fueling concerns.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little bit of uncertainty because people don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s in it,&rdquo; a former White House official said. &ldquo;You put hundreds of witnesses under oath and you throw all these subpoenas around &mdash; if there&rsquo;s nothing controversial or embarrassing that&rsquo;s disclosed, that would be kind of surprising.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> has acknowledged he hasn&rsquo;t read the report even while claiming exoneration.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/7bb3676a-785a-45a9-bcd9-ef773ca444a8/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=720&height=405\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6af0f9bc-c323-4d45-8093-6c1d634addb9/4952.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=338&width=600\"></img></figure>\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make sense to Democrats, who figure they will see either evidence of bad behavior among the 400 pages or redactions so extensive that they can blame Mr. Barr of a cover-up.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have very smart people who will be reading it,&rdquo; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, said Tuesday in a CNN interview.</p>\n<p>Indeed, all of Washington will be studying the report. That includes members of the president&rsquo;s inner circle who, according to NBC News, are fretting about the help they provided to <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-mueller/\">Mr. Mueller</a>.</p>\n<p>Fearing retribution from an angry president, some of those presidential confidants have been reaching out to the Justice Department to see whether they will be named as collaborators in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-mueller/\">Mr. Mueller</a>&rsquo;s findings. The department has refused to offer any solace.</p>\n<p>One person close to the White House told NBC that the hysteria has reached &ldquo;breakdown-level anxiety.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a>, meanwhile, has maintained a consistent line. &ldquo;No Collusion &mdash; No Obstruction!&rdquo; he tweeted Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The report is expected in the morning, igniting a day of study and reaction.</p>\n<p>Bookmakers were offering odds on how <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> would react, such as how many times he will use &ldquo;exonerate&rdquo; or &ldquo;exonerated.&rdquo; BookMaker.eu put the over-under at 1.5 times.</p>\n<p>One of <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a>&rsquo;s attorneys, Rudolph W. Giuliani, told Politico that the president will release a counter report Thursday that runs more than 30 pages.</p>\n<p>Yet a former White House official told The Washington Times that the president&rsquo;s team isn&rsquo;t expecting anything that will change the narrative that <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> was investigated for two years without prosecutors touching him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It just may be a bad news cycle,&rdquo; the source said. &ldquo;In 400 pages, there will probably be a few things.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Democrats say they are not sure the nearly 400 pages Mr. Barr has promised will tell them much, given that he has said every page has information that could demand redaction to protect classified information, grand jury testimony or ongoing, spinoff investigations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just call it The Barr Report. Just in time for Easter, it will be a crazy quilt of colors designed to cover up key facts and, almost more important, break the flow &mdash; and diminish the power &mdash; of the Mueller Report as written,&rdquo; tweeted Elizabeth de la Vega, who served as a federal prosecutor for more than two decades.</p>\n<p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has said Congress must see the full report without redactions.</p>\n<p>Mr. Barr has promised to work with Congress on revealing classified information but has resisted demands to break grand jury secrecy.</p>\n<p>Democrats are especially eager to see what <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-mueller/\">Mr. Mueller</a> says about obstruction of justice after the special counsel specifically said the report was not an exoneration.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a>, meanwhile, is trying to keep the public focused on <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-mueller/\">Mr. Mueller</a>&rsquo;s bigger conclusion that there was no criminal conspiracy with <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/\">Russia</a> &mdash; undercutting the narrative that launched the lengthy investigation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The greatest Scam in political history,&rdquo; he tweeted Tuesday. &ldquo;If the Mainstream Media were honest, which they are not, this story would be bigger and more important than Watergate. Someday!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Outside-the-Beltway analysts said the president&rsquo;s focus could color how the report is seen.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It does make it difficult for Democrats to make clear to the public what the president did that did constitute abuse of power. It&rsquo;s about agenda-setting,&rdquo; said Julian E. Zelizer, a politics professor at Princeton University.</p>",

                "text": "President Trump\u2019s claim that Robert Mueller\u2019s report is a total exoneration is about to be put to the test as what is known about the special counsel\u2019s findings swells from four pages to nearly 400, undermining the White House\u2019s ability to frame the narrative.\nMr. Trump has spent recent days trying to soften the ground before Thursday\u2019s release, saying what matters is Attorney General William P. Barr\u2019s top-line findings that there was no conspiracy with Russia to subvert the 2016 presidential election and not enough evidence to pursue an obstruction of justice case.\nBut the sprawling nature of the 22-month investigation is fueling concerns.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of uncertainty because people don\u2019t really know what\u2019s in it,\u201d a former White House official said. \u201cYou put hundreds of witnesses under oath and you throw all these subpoenas around \u2014 if there\u2019s nothing controversial or embarrassing that\u2019s disclosed, that would be kind of surprising.\u201d\nMr. Trump has acknowledged he hasn\u2019t read the report even while claiming exoneration.\nThat doesn\u2019t make sense to Democrats, who figure they will see either evidence of bad behavior among the 400 pages or redactions so extensive that they can blame Mr. Barr of a cover-up.\n\u201cWe have very smart people who will be reading it,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, said Tuesday in a CNN interview.\nIndeed, all of Washington will be studying the report. That includes members of the president\u2019s inner circle who, according to NBC News, are fretting about the help they provided to Mr. Mueller.\nFearing retribution from an angry president, some of those presidential confidants have been reaching out to the Justice Department to see whether they will be named as collaborators in Mr. Mueller\u2019s findings. The department has refused to offer any solace.\nOne person close to the White House told NBC that the hysteria has reached \u201cbreakdown-level anxiety.\u201d\nMr. Trump, meanwhile, has maintained a consistent line. \u201cNo Collusion \u2014 No Obstruction!\u201d he tweeted Tuesday.\nThe report is expected in the morning, igniting a day of study and reaction.\nBookmakers were offering odds on how Mr. Trump would react, such as how many times he will use \u201cexonerate\u201d or \u201cexonerated.\u201d BookMaker.eu put the over-under at 1.5 times.\nOne of Mr. Trump\u2019s attorneys, Rudolph W. Giuliani, told Politico that the president will release a counter report Thursday that runs more than 30 pages.\nYet a former White House official told The Washington Times that the president\u2019s team isn\u2019t expecting anything that will change the narrative that Mr. Trump was investigated for two years without prosecutors touching him.\n\u201cIt just may be a bad news cycle,\u201d the source said. \u201cIn 400 pages, there will probably be a few things.\u201d\nDemocrats say they are not sure the nearly 400 pages Mr. Barr has promised will tell them much, given that he has said every page has information that could demand redaction to protect classified information, grand jury testimony or ongoing, spinoff investigations.\n\u201cJust call it The Barr Report. Just in time for Easter, it will be a crazy quilt of colors designed to cover up key facts and, almost more important, break the flow \u2014 and diminish the power \u2014 of the Mueller Report as written,\u201d tweeted Elizabeth de la Vega, who served as a federal prosecutor for more than two decades.\nRep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has said Congress must see the full report without redactions.\nMr. Barr has promised to work with Congress on revealing classified information but has resisted demands to break grand jury secrecy.\nDemocrats are especially eager to see what Mr. Mueller says about obstruction of justice after the special counsel specifically said the report was not an exoneration.\nMr. Trump, meanwhile, is trying to keep the public focused on Mr. Mueller\u2019s bigger conclusion that there was no criminal conspiracy with Russia \u2014 undercutting the narrative that launched the lengthy investigation.\n\u201cThe greatest Scam in political history,\u201d he tweeted Tuesday. \u201cIf the Mainstream Media were honest, which they are not, this story would be bigger and more important than Watergate. Someday!\u201d\nOutside-the-Beltway analysts said the president\u2019s focus could color how the report is seen.\n\u201cIt does make it difficult for Democrats to make clear to the public what the president did that did constitute abuse of power. It\u2019s about agenda-setting,\u201d said Julian E. Zelizer, a politics professor at Princeton University.",

On Tuesday authorities said they are looking pais, suspected of making threats on Columbine High School, just days before ...\nLITTLETON, Colo. \u2014 Authorities said Tuesday that they are looking for a young woman who is \u201cinfatuated\u201d with the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School and made threats just days before the 20th anniversary of the attack that killed 13 people.\nThe undisclosed threats led Columbine and several other high schools outside Denver to lock their doors for nearly three hours. All students were safe, school officials said.\nSol Pais, 18, traveled to Colorado on Monday night and has tried to buy firearms, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the FBI. Pais was last seen in the foothills west of Denver, was considered armed and extremely dangerous and should not be approached.\nThe FBI\u2019s Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force issued a notice Tuesday describing Pais as \u201cinfatuated with (the) Columbine school shooting.\u201d The alert said police who come into contact with her should detain her and evaluate her mental health.\nSheriff\u2019s spokesman Mike Taplin said the threats she made were general, not specific to any school.\nOfficials didn\u2019t provide further details or reveal where Pais traveled from, saying it would compromise their investigation.\nThe Denver Post reported that a call to a phone number listed for Pais\u2018 parents in Surfside, Florida, was interrupted by a man who identified himself as an FBI agent and said he was interviewing them.\nThe Associated Press left messages at two numbers listed for Pais\u2018 relatives in Florida, while another number was disconnected.\nThe doors were locked at Columbine and more than 20 other schools in the Denver area as the sheriff\u2019s office said it was investigating threats against schools related to an FBI investigation.\nColumbine students continued attending classes in the afternoon and left school on time, but after-school activities were canceled on the campus in Littleton, Colorado.\nTeenage gunmen attacked Columbine on April 20, 1999, killing 12 classmates and a teacher.",

They are fleeing rough conditions at home and are drawn north by lax enforcement policies that virtually guarantee they can be quickly released into communities, where most disappear into the shadows.</p>\n<p>Of the children and families that came in 2017, more than 98% were still in the U.S. as of the beginning of this year.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has been searching for ways to change the incentives that draw the migrants to the U.S.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Attorney General William Barr announced that migrants who take the first step toward asylum claims will no longer have an automatic right to be released on bond while their cases are proceeding. The ruling, though, won&rsquo;t generally affect the children and families, who are quickly released under other court rulings and laws.</p>\n<p>Also Tuesday, a Homeland Security Department advisory council issued an emergency report calling for the government to take new steps.</p>\n<p>One solution was to set up regional processing centers along the border to centralize the flow of migrants, with new and better facilities to care for the children and families.</p>\n<p>The council also pleaded with Congress to pass emergency legislation to speed up asylum cases so a decision can be issued within a month and asked for a fix to the Flores court settlement that imposes a 20-day limit on how long illegal immigrant families can be held in detention.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the council said, the administration should issue an emergency regulation allowing migrant families to be held.</p>\n<p>Yuma sits on the line between Arizona and California, surrounded by rough, vacant terrain to its east and west. That means it has become the drop-off point for thousands of illegal immigrants each week streaming into the remote parts of California and Arizona, guided by smugglers who bus them north and then leave them to walk across the border and demand attention from U.S. authorities.</p>\n<p>Border Patrol agents arrest them en masse &mdash; a group of 360 people was apprehended near Lukeville, Arizona, earlier Tuesday.</p>\n<p>But with no ability to hold them, agents engage in what is called &ldquo;catch-and-release,&rdquo; processing the migrants and then letting them go at a local bus terminal.</p>\n<p>Communities along the border have issued desperate pleas for help, but Yuma&rsquo;s state of emergency is the most striking reaction.</p>\n<p>Mr. Nichollls said the local shelter&rsquo;s normal capacity is 150 people but it can stretch to accommodate 250. It began Tuesday with 200 people, and Border Patrol agents said they were going to deliver 120 more people during the day, putting the facility well beyond its limits.</p>\n<p>The mayor said even if the city had a bigger building, the number of people swamps the capacity for volunteers and supplies &mdash; though he did issue a call for donations of coloring books, diapers, snacks and bottled water.</p>\n<p>He said the issue is transportation in a town of about 100,000 people, where bus links aren&rsquo;t extensive and there isn&rsquo;t enough capacity to ship people out as fast as they are being dropped off by the Border Patrol.</p>\n<p>President Trump has proposed siphoning the illegal immigrants from the border into sanctuary cities elsewhere, saying it&rsquo;s only right those communities step up, given their policies and proclamations about welcoming migrants. That idea has ignited a firestorm in Washington, where Democrats called it unbecoming.</p>\n<p>Yet some sanctuary cities have stepped forward to say they would embrace the migrants.</p>\n<p>Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf over the weekend said she would be happy to do so. &ldquo;Oakland welcomes all, no matter where you came from or how you got here,&rdquo; she wrote in response to Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto also accepted the challenge this week, saying his city &ldquo;would welcome all.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump cast his proposal as political payback, but others have said it&rsquo;s a necessity, at least so far as releasing the migrants away from the border, where the communities are already overwhelmed.</p>",

                "text": "Yuma, a city on the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, declared a state of emergency Tuesday, saying it cannot handle the crush of illegal immigrants the government is being forced to release onto its streets.\nMayor Douglas Nicholls said the migrants are being released by the Border Patrol into his community faster than they can leave, and local shelters are already at capacity.\nHe warned of mobs of people \u201croaming the streets looking to satisfy basic human needs,\u201d clashing with citizens looking to protect their own property.\n\u201cThere is an imminent threat on having too many migrant releases into our community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s above our capacity as a community to sustain.\u201d\nThe move was designed to draw the attention of the country to what locals said was an untenable situation and to beg for solutions from the federal government, which has been at a political stalemate over what to do.\nMr. Nicholls said he is trying to get other Arizona communities to issue similar declarations, hoping a critical mass of voices will cut through the partisan gridlock.\nThe migrants are overwhelmingly families and unaccompanied children from Central America. They are fleeing rough conditions at home and are drawn north by lax enforcement policies that virtually guarantee they can be quickly released into communities, where most disappear into the shadows.\nOf the children and families that came in 2017, more than 98% were still in the U.S. as of the beginning of this year.\nThe Trump administration has been searching for ways to change the incentives that draw the migrants to the U.S.\nOn Tuesday, Attorney General William Barr announced that migrants who take the first step toward asylum claims will no longer have an automatic right to be released on bond while their cases are proceeding. The ruling, though, won\u2019t generally affect the children and families, who are quickly released under other court rulings and laws.\nAlso Tuesday, a Homeland Security Department advisory council issued an emergency report calling for the government to take new steps.\nOne solution was to set up regional processing centers along the border to centralize the flow of migrants, with new and better facilities to care for the children and families.\nThe council also pleaded with Congress to pass emergency legislation to speed up asylum cases so a decision can be issued within a month and asked for a fix to the Flores court settlement that imposes a 20-day limit on how long illegal immigrant families can be held in detention.\nIn the meantime, the council said, the administration should issue an emergency regulation allowing migrant families to be held.\nYuma sits on the line between Arizona and California, surrounded by rough, vacant terrain to its east and west. That means it has become the drop-off point for thousands of illegal immigrants each week streaming into the remote parts of California and Arizona, guided by smugglers who bus them north and then leave them to walk across the border and demand attention from U.S. authorities.\nBorder Patrol agents arrest them en masse \u2014 a group of 360 people was apprehended near Lukeville, Arizona, earlier Tuesday.\nBut with no ability to hold them, agents engage in what is called \u201ccatch-and-release,\u201d processing the migrants and then letting them go at a local bus terminal.\nCommunities along the border have issued desperate pleas for help, but Yuma\u2019s state of emergency is the most striking reaction.\nMr. Nichollls said the local shelter\u2019s normal capacity is 150 people but it can stretch to accommodate 250. It began Tuesday with 200 people, and Border Patrol agents said they were going to deliver 120 more people during the day, putting the facility well beyond its limits.\nThe mayor said even if the city had a bigger building, the number of people swamps the capacity for volunteers and supplies \u2014 though he did issue a call for donations of coloring books, diapers, snacks and bottled water.\nHe said the issue is transportation in a town of about 100,000 people, where bus links aren\u2019t extensive and there isn\u2019t enough capacity to ship people out as fast as they are being dropped off by the Border Patrol.\nPresident Trump has proposed siphoning the illegal immigrants from the border into sanctuary cities elsewhere, saying it\u2019s only right those communities step up, given their policies and proclamations about welcoming migrants. That idea has ignited a firestorm in Washington, where Democrats called it unbecoming.\nYet some sanctuary cities have stepped forward to say they would embrace the migrants.\nOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf over the weekend said she would be happy to do so. \u201cOakland welcomes all, no matter where you came from or how you got here,\u201d she wrote in response to Mr. Trump.\nPittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto also accepted the challenge this week, saying his city \u201cwould welcome all.\u201d\nMr. Trump cast his proposal as political payback, but others have said it\u2019s a necessity, at least so far as releasing the migrants away from the border, where the communities are already overwhelmed.",

Tiny. Thing. And not a moment too soon. The curmudgeonly socialist from Vermont is ramping up his 2020 election campaign and the grumpy, caftan-clad grandmother is mulling her options. (For the record, we&rsquo;ll predict that she gets in because what the @#%&amp; else has she got to do?!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Bernie</a>, of course, has reason to be sore after his 2016 loss to <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary</a> in the Democratic Party primaries. Early on, Team <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Clinton</a> essentially took over the Democratic National Committee, which then made things very difficult for <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead,&rdquo; Donna Brazile, the former DNC interim chairwoman, wrote in November 2016, days after the election.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party&rsquo;s integrity,&rdquo; she said, adding that while it may not have been illegal, &ldquo;it sure looked unethical.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/7bb3676a-785a-45a9-bcd9-ef773ca444a8/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=720&height=405\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6af0f9bc-c323-4d45-8093-6c1d634addb9/4952.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=338&width=600\"></img></figure>\n<p>Everything from the primary and debate schedule to the excessive power of super-delegates helped <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a> secure the nomination, even though <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> was drawing far larger crowds and had massive support from all wings of the party. Even Ms. Brazile, for all her honesty about what happened to <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Bernie</a>, helped her longtime friend <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary</a>: At one point, the former CNN contributor delivered the network&rsquo;s prepared questions to <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a>&rsquo;s campaign just before a crucial debate.</p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary</a>, too, perhaps has reason to bear a grudge. <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> &mdash; with his &ldquo;free everything for everybody&rdquo; campaign platform &mdash; pushed the anointed candidate far to the left in order for her to secure the nomination, making <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a> a sitting duck for the crafty Donald Trump, who systematically dismantled her during the general election. Plus, he stayed in the race forever, forcing <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a> to spend much needed cash.</p>\n<p>So, there no love lost between <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Bernie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary</a> &mdash; to be clearer, they pretty much hate each other. And that goes for their staffs, too.</p>\n<p>Which brings us right up to this week. Yes, the soap opera is back, starring two septuagenarians in a remake of &ldquo;The Odd Couple.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Several former <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Clinton</a> staffers told Politico this week that after <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary</a> won the nomination, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> frequently requested the use of private planes paid for by the Clinton campaign as he traveled the country in order to appear at rallies for her. That became &ldquo;a running joke in the office,&rdquo; partly because <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> is a socialist who is vehemently pushing for the end of fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop Donald Trump, his Royal Majesty King <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Bernie Sanders</a> would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe,&rdquo; said Zac Petkanas, who was the director of rapid response for the Clinton campaign.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Bernie</a>&rsquo;s jet-setting ended up costing the campaign of <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a> and running mate Tim Kaine $100,000.</p>\n<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Bernie</a>&rsquo;s people to punch back. His 2016 presidential campaign spokesman, Michael Briggs, called Team <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Clinton</a> the &ldquo;biggest a**holes in American politics.&rdquo; He also called <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a>&rsquo;s staff &ldquo;total ingrates&rdquo; for complaining about the use of private planes, which he said was the only way <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Sanders</a> could get to campaign events in time.</p>\n<p>And he didn&rsquo;t mince words.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You can see why she&rsquo;s one of the most disliked politicians in America,&rdquo; Mr. Briggs said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not nice. Her people are not nice. [<a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a>] busted his tail to fly all over the country to talk about why it made sense to elect <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary Clinton</a> and the thanks that [we] get is this kind of petty stupid sniping a couple years after the fact.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Briggs added: &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make me feel good to feel this way but they&rsquo;re some of the biggest a**holes in American politics.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s got a way with words, doesn&rsquo;t he?</p>\n<p>Please, God &mdash; if you&rsquo;re listening &mdash; please have <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary</a> run again.

                "text": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\nThey\u2019re like a cranky old couple bickering and snippering at each other in Ikea as they clash over whether to buy the Grnkulla or the Knutstorp.\nBernie Sanders, 77, and Hillary Clinton, 71, are back at it again, squabbling and wrangling over Every. Tiny. Thing. And not a moment too soon. The curmudgeonly socialist from Vermont is ramping up his 2020 election campaign and the grumpy, caftan-clad grandmother is mulling her options. (For the record, we\u2019ll predict that she gets in because what the @#%& else has she got to do?!)\nBernie, of course, has reason to be sore after his 2016 loss to Hillary in the Democratic Party primaries. Early on, Team Clinton essentially took over the Democratic National Committee, which then made things very difficult for Mr. Sanders.\n\u201cIf the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead,\u201d Donna Brazile, the former DNC interim chairwoman, wrote in November 2016, days after the election.\n\u201cThis was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party\u2019s integrity,\u201d she said, adding that while it may not have been illegal, \u201cit sure looked unethical.\u201d\nEverything from the primary and debate schedule to the excessive power of super-delegates helped Mrs. Clinton secure the nomination, even though Mr. Sanders was drawing far larger crowds and had massive support from all wings of the party. Even Ms. Brazile, for all her honesty about what happened to Bernie, helped her longtime friend Hillary: At one point, the former CNN contributor delivered the network\u2019s prepared questions to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign just before a crucial debate.\nAnd Hillary, too, perhaps has reason to bear a grudge. Mr. Sanders \u2014 with his \u201cfree everything for everybody\u201d campaign platform \u2014 pushed the anointed candidate far to the left in order for her to secure the nomination, making Mrs. Clinton a sitting duck for the crafty Donald Trump, who systematically dismantled her during the general election. Plus, he stayed in the race forever, forcing Mrs. Clinton to spend much needed cash.\nSo, there no love lost between Bernie and Hillary \u2014 to be clearer, they pretty much hate each other. And that goes for their staffs, too.\nWhich brings us right up to this week. Yes, the soap opera is back, starring two septuagenarians in a remake of \u201cThe Odd Couple.\u201d\nSeveral former Clinton staffers told Politico this week that after Hillary won the nomination, Mr. Sanders frequently requested the use of private planes paid for by the Clinton campaign as he traveled the country in order to appear at rallies for her. That became \u201ca running joke in the office,\u201d partly because Mr. Sanders is a socialist who is vehemently pushing for the end of fossil fuels.\n\u201cI\u2019m not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop Donald Trump, his Royal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe,\u201d said Zac Petkanas, who was the director of rapid response for the Clinton campaign.\nBernie\u2019s jet-setting ended up costing the campaign of Mrs. Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine $100,000.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Bernie\u2019s people to punch back. His 2016 presidential campaign spokesman, Michael Briggs, called Team Clinton the \u201cbiggest a**holes in American politics.\u201d He also called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s staff \u201ctotal ingrates\u201d for complaining about the use of private planes, which he said was the only way Sanders could get to campaign events in time.\nAnd he didn\u2019t mince words.\n\u201cYou can see why she\u2019s one of the most disliked politicians in America,\u201d Mr. Briggs said. \u201cShe\u2019s not nice. Her people are not nice. [Mr. Sanders] busted his tail to fly all over the country to talk about why it made sense to elect Hillary Clinton and the thanks that [we] get is this kind of petty stupid sniping a couple years after the fact.\u201d\nMr. Briggs added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me feel good to feel this way but they\u2019re some of the biggest a**holes in American politics.\u201d He\u2019s got a way with words, doesn\u2019t he?\nPlease, God \u2014 if you\u2019re listening \u2014 please have Hillary run again. Just one more time. Please!\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times. He can be reached at josephcurl@gmail.com and on Twitter @josephcurl.",

I very much appreciate no [missile] testing. I am not in a rush.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/7bb3676a-785a-45a9-bcd9-ef773ca444a8/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=720&height=405\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6af0f9bc-c323-4d45-8093-6c1d634addb9/4952.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=338&width=600\"></img></figure>\n<p>Asked if he was confident of a deal, Mr. Kim replied through a translator, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early to say. I would not say I&rsquo;m pessimistic. I have a feeling that good results will come.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The heavy lifting of the two-day summit to address the crisis on the divided Korean Peninsula was planned for Thursday, when the two delegations will try to hammer out a deal to curb Pyongyang&rsquo;s nuclear and missile arsenals and ease more than six decades of hostility and suspicion between the U.S. and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/\">North Korea</a>.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kim thanked the president for his &ldquo;courageous decision&rdquo; to negotiate with him personally and said there have been &ldquo;some misunderstandings&rdquo; since their precedent-shattering first meeting in Singapore in June.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There have been all these eyes from the world who are misunderstanding the situation,&rdquo; said Mr. Kim, referring to &ldquo;hostility&rdquo; lingering from the Korean War. &ldquo;However, we have been able to overcome all the obstacles, and here we are today after 261 days.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Despite the questions surrounding the summit, the White House official schedule for Thursday has blocked out time for a &ldquo;joint agreement signing ceremony&rdquo; followed by a news conference by <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a>.</p>\n<p>Amid high intrigue &mdash; and with much of Washington transfixed by the daylong congressional testimony of former <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Trump</a> attorney and &ldquo;fixer&rdquo; Michael Cohen, the two leaders arrived at dusk at the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi hotel in separate motorcades and shook hands in front of a bank of U.S. and North Korean flags. They chatted briefly and smiled for news cameras.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I thought the first summit was a great success, and I think this one hopefully will be equal or greater than the first,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> told his counterpart, whom he called a &ldquo;great leader.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Then, with only their two interpreters present, the leaders huddled for 30 minutes in a conference room for a private initial discussion.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kim and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> later shared a 90-minute dinner of shrimp cocktail, grilled sirloin and chocolate lava cake joined by a small group of aides: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on the U.S. side, and Kim Yong-chol, a former intelligence chief and Mr. Kim&rsquo;s point man in negotiations and North Korean Foreign Affairs Minister Ri Yong-ho.</p>\n<p>Outside the hotel, thousands of spectators and journalists thronged the security perimeter to get glimpses of the leaders and their entourages.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kim said that since their initial meeting last summer, he went through a time in which &ldquo;I agonized &hellip; and have more patience than at any time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am confident that such a great outcome will come out this time which can be welcomed by everyone, and I will do my best to this end,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>The White House billed Wednesday&rsquo;s meeting as mainly a casual event, with the tougher talks to come Thursday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> earlier in the day called Mr. Kim &ldquo;my friend&rdquo; on Twitter. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> taunted Mr. Kim as &ldquo;Little Rocket Man&rdquo; when <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/\">North Korea</a> was launching test missiles and tensions over a possible shooting war soared across East Asia.</p>\n<p><strong>Cohen distraction</strong></p>\n<p>Even as <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> was negotiating over one of the world&rsquo;s most urgent security threats, the president also was paying attention to developments in Washington. He fired back on Twitter after Mr. Cohen told a House committee that his former employer was a &ldquo;con man,&rdquo; a &ldquo;cheater&rdquo; and a &ldquo;racist.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately),&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> tweeted just hours before his first meeting with Mr. Kim. &ldquo;He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying &amp; fraud. He did bad things unrelated to <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Trump</a>. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As the president and Mr. Kim headed into the crucial part of the summit, Democrats and some private analysts expressed fears that <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a>, in his eagerness to strike a deal, will ease sanctions or give other concessions to Mr. Kim without getting anything concrete in return.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The fact that <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Trump</a> wants a deal so bad and is such a terrible negotiator should scare us all heading into the summit with Kim,&rdquo; tweeted Sen. Christopher Murphy, Connecticut Democrat and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>\n<p>The president said ahead of the meeting that his critics and the media were in the dark. He criticized &ldquo;false reporting (guessing) on my intentions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Kim Jong Un and I will try very hard to work something out on denuclearization &amp; then making <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/\">North Korea</a> an Economic Powerhouse,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> tweeted. &ldquo;I believe that China, Russia, Japan &amp; South Korea will be very helpful!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sources close to the negotiations have told The Washington Times that success would be reached if any joint statement from the summit includes an indication that <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/\">North Korea</a> will allow international inspectors into the country to examine nuclear sites.</p>\n<p>If the joint statement does not include that word, then the next best thing would be for Mr. Kim to say &ldquo;inspectors&rdquo; during a likely post-summit press conference on Thursday, the sources said.</p>\n<p>While U.S. officials have praised their Vietnamese hosts for the organization of the summit, there have been some hiccups.</p>\n<p>Some U.S. reporters covering the event as part of <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a>&rsquo;s media pool were excluded from the meeting with Mr. Kim, apparently over annoyance with reporters&rsquo; shouted questions concerning Mr. Cohen. Only one newspaper reporter was allowed to cover the leaders&rsquo; final comments of the evening. TV, radio and wire service reporters were barred, and White House Correspondents&rsquo; Association President Olivier Knox said the press corps &ldquo;strenuously objects to [this] capricious decision.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the move, citing the &ldquo;sensitive nature of the meetings.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are continuing to negotiate aspects of this historic summit and will always work to make sure the U.S. media has as much access as possible,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p><strong>Objects of curiosity</strong></p>\n<p>Outside the meeting site, there was an atmosphere of fascination and excitement among the crowd of people who waited for the two leaders.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The two most talked-about men in the world are coming,&rdquo; said Davin Reid, a 29-year-old Canadian who was among thousands packing around an intersection near the hotel&rsquo;s entrance.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I want to see <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kim-jong-un/\">Kim Jong-un</a>,&rdquo; said Mr. Reid&rsquo;s girlfriend, Kailyn Leckie, 23. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a fascinating human.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not fans,&rdquo; Mr. Reid added quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a morbid curiosity. I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Clark University professor Srinivasan Sitaraman, a specialist on U.S. foreign policy, said the summit&rsquo;s first day left key questions unanswered about what <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> hopes to achieve in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hanoi/\">Hanoi</a> to build on the vague promises the two men made in Singapore.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still left without knowing if there is an accepted definition of denuclearization between the two parties going into the summit,&rdquo; he said Wednesday. &ldquo;It is critical that the United States and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/\">North Korea</a> at least arrive at an accepted definition of denuclearization at this summit to establish that the two parties are not talking past each other.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Questions of verification and timing on ending the North&rsquo;s nuclear problem also hang over the talks.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Early indications from the summit suggest that it would probably be a little premature to expect such developments,&rdquo; Mr. Sitaraman said.</p>\n<p>Some observers also worried that <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> could agree to a peace declaration on the Korean War, which ended in 1953 in a legal stalemate, without gaining anything in return. Bruce Klingner, former CIA Korea deputy division chief and an analyst with The Heritage Foundation, said such a concession could end up &ldquo;reducing U.S. deterrence and defense capabilities, and abrogating the mutual defense treaty before reducing the North Korean threat.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/\">North Korea</a> argues that the U.S. must prove an end to its &lsquo;hostile policy,&rsquo; but it is <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/\">North Korea</a> that has habitually threatened, attacked and killed U.S. and South Korean personnel,&rdquo; Mr. Klingner said. &ldquo;The U.S. has already repeatedly provided non-hostility declarations and promises not to attack <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/\">North Korea</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> emphasized again Wednesday his belief that the largely isolated <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/\">North Korea</a> stands to enjoy unprecedented prosperity if Mr. Kim commits to clear steps toward dismantling his uranium and plutonium processing plants and destroy his arsenal of missiles.</p>\n<p>Earlier Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> praised <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vietnam/\">Vietnam</a> for its &ldquo;thriving&rdquo; economy as he signed a trade deal with Vietnamese leaders and sought to persuade Mr. Kim to follow <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hanoi/\">Hanoi</a>&rsquo;s example.</p>\n<p>Meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> signed agreements calling for <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vietnam/\">Vietnam</a> to purchase more than 100 passenger airliners from Seattle-based Boeing Inc., a deal worth about $21 billion.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You really are an example of what can happen with good thinking,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> told Vietnamese President Nguyen Phu Trong and other officials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> also said approvingly that <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vietnam/\">Vietnam</a> is interested in purchasing U.S.-made military equipment.</p>\n<p>At a luncheon with Vietnamese officials, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> said greater cooperation from Mr. Kim would &ldquo;make <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/\">North Korea</a> into a great economic power.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "HANOI, Vietnam \u2014 President Trump warmly greeted North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Wednesday at the start of their second denuclearization summit, predicting that their \u201cgreat relationship\u201d will lead to fruitful negotiations over the North\u2019s nuclear weapons.\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be very successful,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cThe biggest progress is our relationship is really a good one.\u201d\nHe told Mr. Kim that North Korea has \u201ctremendous economic potential\u201d from eased international sanctions if he agrees to abandon its weapons and missile programs, which analysts say can now deliver a nuclear bomb to much of the U.S. homeland.\nAs the two leaders sat down again Thursday morning in Hanoi, Mr. Trump tried to play down short-term expectations.\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for today, but over a little bit longer term .. we\u2019re going to have a fantastic success,\u201d the president said. \u201cSpeed is not that important to me. I very much appreciate no [missile] testing. I am not in a rush.\u201d\nAsked if he was confident of a deal, Mr. Kim replied through a translator, \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say. I would not say I\u2019m pessimistic. I have a feeling that good results will come.\u201d\nThe heavy lifting of the two-day summit to address the crisis on the divided Korean Peninsula was planned for Thursday, when the two delegations will try to hammer out a deal to curb Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile arsenals and ease more than six decades of hostility and suspicion between the U.S. and North Korea.\nMr. Kim thanked the president for his \u201ccourageous decision\u201d to negotiate with him personally and said there have been \u201csome misunderstandings\u201d since their precedent-shattering first meeting in Singapore in June.\n\u201cThere have been all these eyes from the world who are misunderstanding the situation,\u201d said Mr. Kim, referring to \u201chostility\u201d lingering from the Korean War. \u201cHowever, we have been able to overcome all the obstacles, and here we are today after 261 days.\u201d\nDespite the questions surrounding the summit, the White House official schedule for Thursday has blocked out time for a \u201cjoint agreement signing ceremony\u201d followed by a news conference by Mr. Trump.\nAmid high intrigue \u2014 and with much of Washington transfixed by the daylong congressional testimony of former Trump attorney and \u201cfixer\u201d Michael Cohen, the two leaders arrived at dusk at the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi hotel in separate motorcades and shook hands in front of a bank of U.S. and North Korean flags. They chatted briefly and smiled for news cameras.\n\u201cI thought the first summit was a great success, and I think this one hopefully will be equal or greater than the first,\u201d Mr. Trump told his counterpart, whom he called a \u201cgreat leader.\u201d\nThen, with only their two interpreters present, the leaders huddled for 30 minutes in a conference room for a private initial discussion.\nMr. Kim and Mr. Trump later shared a 90-minute dinner of shrimp cocktail, grilled sirloin and chocolate lava cake joined by a small group of aides: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on the U.S. side, and Kim Yong-chol, a former intelligence chief and Mr. Kim\u2019s point man in negotiations and North Korean Foreign Affairs Minister Ri Yong-ho.\nOutside the hotel, thousands of spectators and journalists thronged the security perimeter to get glimpses of the leaders and their entourages.\nMr. Kim said that since their initial meeting last summer, he went through a time in which \u201cI agonized \u2026 and have more patience than at any time.\u201d\n\u201cI am confident that such a great outcome will come out this time which can be welcomed by everyone, and I will do my best to this end,\u201d he said.\nThe White House billed Wednesday\u2019s meeting as mainly a casual event, with the tougher talks to come Thursday.\nMr. Trump earlier in the day called Mr. Kim \u201cmy friend\u201d on Twitter. In 2017, Mr. Trump taunted Mr. Kim as \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d when North Korea was launching test missiles and tensions over a possible shooting war soared across East Asia.\nCohen distraction\nEven as Mr. Trump was negotiating over one of the world\u2019s most urgent security threats, the president also was paying attention to developments in Washington. He fired back on Twitter after Mr. Cohen told a House committee that his former employer was a \u201ccon man,\u201d a \u201ccheater\u201d and a \u201cracist.\u201d\n\u201cMichael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately),\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted just hours before his first meeting with Mr. Kim. \u201cHe had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time.\u201d\nAs the president and Mr. Kim headed into the crucial part of the summit, Democrats and some private analysts expressed fears that Mr. Trump, in his eagerness to strike a deal, will ease sanctions or give other concessions to Mr. Kim without getting anything concrete in return.\n\u201cThe fact that Trump wants a deal so bad and is such a terrible negotiator should scare us all heading into the summit with Kim,\u201d tweeted Sen. Christopher Murphy, Connecticut Democrat and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nThe president said ahead of the meeting that his critics and the media were in the dark. He criticized \u201cfalse reporting (guessing) on my intentions.\u201d\n\u201cKim Jong Un and I will try very hard to work something out on denuclearization & then making North Korea an Economic Powerhouse,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cI believe that China, Russia, Japan & South Korea will be very helpful!\u201d\nSources close to the negotiations have told The Washington Times that success would be reached if any joint statement from the summit includes an indication that North Korea will allow international inspectors into the country to examine nuclear sites.\nIf the joint statement does not include that word, then the next best thing would be for Mr. Kim to say \u201cinspectors\u201d during a likely post-summit press conference on Thursday, the sources said.\nWhile U.S. officials have praised their Vietnamese hosts for the organization of the summit, there have been some hiccups.\nSome U.S. reporters covering the event as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s media pool were excluded from the meeting with Mr. Kim, apparently over annoyance with reporters\u2019 shouted questions concerning Mr. Cohen. Only one newspaper reporter was allowed to cover the leaders\u2019 final comments of the evening. TV, radio and wire service reporters were barred, and White House Correspondents\u2019 Association President Olivier Knox said the press corps \u201cstrenuously objects to [this] capricious decision.\u201d\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the move, citing the \u201csensitive nature of the meetings.\u201d\n\u201cWe are continuing to negotiate aspects of this historic summit and will always work to make sure the U.S. media has as much access as possible,\u201d she said.\nObjects of curiosity\nOutside the meeting site, there was an atmosphere of fascination and excitement among the crowd of people who waited for the two leaders.\n\u201cThe two most talked-about men in the world are coming,\u201d said Davin Reid, a 29-year-old Canadian who was among thousands packing around an intersection near the hotel\u2019s entrance.\n\u201cI want to see Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Mr. Reid\u2019s girlfriend, Kailyn Leckie, 23. \u201cHe\u2019s just a fascinating human.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not fans,\u201d Mr. Reid added quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s just a morbid curiosity. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d\nClark University professor Srinivasan Sitaraman, a specialist on U.S. foreign policy, said the summit\u2019s first day left key questions unanswered about what Mr. Trump hopes to achieve in Hanoi to build on the vague promises the two men made in Singapore.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still left without knowing if there is an accepted definition of denuclearization between the two parties going into the summit,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cIt is critical that the United States and North Korea at least arrive at an accepted definition of denuclearization at this summit to establish that the two parties are not talking past each other.\u201d\nQuestions of verification and timing on ending the North\u2019s nuclear problem also hang over the talks.\n\u201cEarly indications from the summit suggest that it would probably be a little premature to expect such developments,\u201d Mr. Sitaraman said.\nSome observers also worried that Mr. Trump could agree to a peace declaration on the Korean War, which ended in 1953 in a legal stalemate, without gaining anything in return. Bruce Klingner, former CIA Korea deputy division chief and an analyst with The Heritage Foundation, said such a concession could end up \u201creducing U.S. deterrence and defense capabilities, and abrogating the mutual defense treaty before reducing the North Korean threat.\u201d\n\u201cNorth Korea argues that the U.S. must prove an end to its \u2018hostile policy,\u2019 but it is North Korea that has habitually threatened, attacked and killed U.S. and South Korean personnel,\u201d Mr. Klingner said. \u201cThe U.S. has already repeatedly provided non-hostility declarations and promises not to attack North Korea.\u201d\nMr. Trump emphasized again Wednesday his belief that the largely isolated North Korea stands to enjoy unprecedented prosperity if Mr. Kim commits to clear steps toward dismantling his uranium and plutonium processing plants and destroy his arsenal of missiles.\nEarlier Wednesday, Mr. Trump praised Vietnam for its \u201cthriving\u201d economy as he signed a trade deal with Vietnamese leaders and sought to persuade Mr. Kim to follow Hanoi\u2019s example.\nMeeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Mr. Trump signed agreements calling for Vietnam to purchase more than 100 passenger airliners from Seattle-based Boeing Inc., a deal worth about $21 billion.\n\u201cYou really are an example of what can happen with good thinking,\u201d Mr. Trump told Vietnamese President Nguyen Phu Trong and other officials.\nMr. Trump also said approvingly that Vietnam is interested in purchasing U.S.-made military equipment.\nAt a luncheon with Vietnamese officials, Mr. Trump said greater cooperation from Mr. Kim would \u201cmake North Korea into a great economic power.\u201d",

Mark Meadows brought in a former Trump staffer as a guest to refute the claims of racism by the president&rsquo;s former personal attorney <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-cohen/\">Michael Cohen</a> during a Wednesday hearing at the House Oversight Committee.</p>\n<p>Mr. Meadows, North Carolina Republican, introduced Lynne Patton, a former staffer and current official at the Housing and Urban Development, as his guest. <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-cohen/\">Cohen</a> said he helped Ms. Patton get her current decision in HUD.</p>\n<p>The congressman said Ms. Patton, who is African-American, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t agree with&rdquo; the &ldquo;demeaning&rdquo; remarks <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-cohen/\">Cohen</a> made that Mr. Trump is racist during testimony in front of the committee.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She says that as a daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, that there is no way that she would work for an individual who was racist,&rdquo; Mr. Meadows said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As neither should I, as the son of a Holocaust survivor,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-cohen/\">Cohen</a> responded.

Mark Meadows brought in a former Trump staffer as a guest to refute the claims of racism by the president\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen during a Wednesday hearing at the House Oversight Committee.\nMr. Meadows, North Carolina Republican, introduced Lynne Patton, a former staffer and current official at the Housing and Urban Development, as his guest. Cohen said he helped Ms. Patton get her current decision in HUD.\nThe congressman said Ms. Patton, who is African-American, \u201cdoesn\u2019t agree with\u201d the \u201cdemeaning\u201d remarks Cohen made that Mr. Trump is racist during testimony in front of the committee.\n\u201cShe says that as a daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, that there is no way that she would work for an individual who was racist,\u201d Mr. Meadows said.\n\u201cAs neither should I, as the son of a Holocaust survivor,\u201d Cohen responded. He later asked Mr. Meadows to ask Ms. Patton: \u201cHow many people who are black are executives at the Trump administration?\u201d\n\u201cThe answer is zero,\u201d Cohen said. Mr. Meadows asked for Ms. Patton\u2019s testimony to be submitted as evidence, which chairmen Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, Maryland Democrat, approved.\nCohen claimed in his opening testimony that Mr. Trump once asked if he could name a country run by a black person that wasn\u2019t a \u201cs\u2013hole\u201d while Barack Obama was president. Cohen said Mr. Trump also said that black people wouldn\u2019t vote for the him because they were \u201ctoo stupid.\u201d\nThe NAACP released a statement that said Mr. Trump\u2019s record of racial equality points to him as \u201ca racist who is wholly uninterested in advancing the cause of civil rights.\u201d\nCohen will begin a three-year prison sentence in May after he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in 2017 and committing campaign finance violations while he was working for Mr. Trump.",

One design remained standing Wednesday afternoon. Local press reported that it was too sturdy to be knocked down with the jackhammer.</p>\n<p>The demolition was a quick end to a high-profile symbol of <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a>&rsquo;s campaign promise, though an official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection said they had already gleaned what they could from the prototypes.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We learned a lot from them, but we don&rsquo;t necessarily have a purpose or use for them,&rdquo; the official said.</p>\n<p>What they learned was that the existing designs were good enough.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/7bb3676a-785a-45a9-bcd9-ef773ca444a8/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=720&height=405\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6af0f9bc-c323-4d45-8093-6c1d634addb9/4952.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=338&width=600\"></img></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Trump</a> opponents took to Twitter to cheer the prototypes&rsquo; demise and saw metaphors in photos depicting the razings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> had touted the prototypes as a major part of his campaign promise to build a border wall. He at one point suggested that he would be personally involved in picking a winning design and traveled to the border in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-diego/\">San Diego</a> to see the prototypes up close.</p>\n<p>CBP said in 2017 that it had allocated $20 million for the prototypes and selected six companies to build the eight designs.</p>\n<p>But agents said none of them turned out to be practical, and a government audit concluded that none of them could be built without needing significant modifications.</p>\n<p>Congress has been cool to the prototypes, including language in spending bills preventing the Trump administration from constructing any design that didn&rsquo;t exist under President Obama.</p>\n<p>Agents said that was no big deal because the bollard-style fence was good.</p>\n<p>But it has been a black eye for <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a>, who has repeatedly talked about the intricacies of fence design &mdash; often in contradictory terms.</p>\n<p>He bragged this week that the wall he will be building is more attractive than what had been built in the past.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have a much better prototype. It&rsquo;s actually a beautiful wall,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve always said part of the wall was that previous administrations, when they did little walls, they built them so badly. So badly. It&rsquo;s so unattractive. I wouldn&rsquo;t want them in my backyard. And the new one is incredible looking. It&rsquo;s a piece of art, in a sense. And it&rsquo;s, by the way, more effective.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Asked what the president meant, the CBP official Wednesday said she couldn&rsquo;t speak for <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a>.</p>\n<p>When the government asked for bids to build the prototypes, the walls were supposed to be able to withstand breaching attempts for up to four hours and to be difficult to climb. They were also supposed to look imposing.</p>\n<p>Of the eight prototypes, six of them had solid construction at ground level, which meant agents didn&rsquo;t have visibility into Mexico. Agents said that was a major flaw because it meant they couldn&rsquo;t see people preparing for an attempt to jump the border, and it also gave bad actors a better chance at ambushing Border Patrol agents.</p>\n<p>Two models did have slats at the base, with solid construction at the top.</p>\n<p>Some had protruding structures at the top that were supposed to deter climbers.</p>\n<p>The CBP official said they did learn lessons from the prototypes, such as additional methods for internally hardening bollards used in fencing.</p>\n<p>Part of the reason the walls need to come down is that they are in the way of real fence construction. The administration is about to begin building a secondary fence in part of <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-diego/\">San Diego</a>, and the path will run through where the prototypes were built.</p>\n<p>In addition to those eight prototypes, another set was built on a separate Border Patrol site. Those were used for breach-testing. The CBP official said those already have been taken down.</p>",

                "text": "The prototypes built as part of President Trump\u2019s border wall competition were torn down Wednesday after officials said they had served their purpose and were standing in the way of building a new section of actual border fencing.\nPhotos and video from San Diego showed a hydraulic jackhammer being used to punch into the prototypes, knocking them to the ground while a water cannon sprayed the area. One design remained standing Wednesday afternoon. Local press reported that it was too sturdy to be knocked down with the jackhammer.\nThe demolition was a quick end to a high-profile symbol of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise, though an official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection said they had already gleaned what they could from the prototypes.\n\u201cWe learned a lot from them, but we don\u2019t necessarily have a purpose or use for them,\u201d the official said.\nWhat they learned was that the existing designs were good enough.\nTrump opponents took to Twitter to cheer the prototypes\u2019 demise and saw metaphors in photos depicting the razings.\nMr. Trump had touted the prototypes as a major part of his campaign promise to build a border wall. He at one point suggested that he would be personally involved in picking a winning design and traveled to the border in San Diego to see the prototypes up close.\nCBP said in 2017 that it had allocated $20 million for the prototypes and selected six companies to build the eight designs.\nBut agents said none of them turned out to be practical, and a government audit concluded that none of them could be built without needing significant modifications.\nCongress has been cool to the prototypes, including language in spending bills preventing the Trump administration from constructing any design that didn\u2019t exist under President Obama.\nAgents said that was no big deal because the bollard-style fence was good.\nBut it has been a black eye for Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly talked about the intricacies of fence design \u2014 often in contradictory terms.\nHe bragged this week that the wall he will be building is more attractive than what had been built in the past.\n\u201cWe have a much better prototype. It\u2019s actually a beautiful wall,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always said part of the wall was that previous administrations, when they did little walls, they built them so badly. So badly. It\u2019s so unattractive. I wouldn\u2019t want them in my backyard. And the new one is incredible looking. It\u2019s a piece of art, in a sense. And it\u2019s, by the way, more effective.\u201d\nAsked what the president meant, the CBP official Wednesday said she couldn\u2019t speak for Mr. Trump.\nWhen the government asked for bids to build the prototypes, the walls were supposed to be able to withstand breaching attempts for up to four hours and to be difficult to climb. They were also supposed to look imposing.\nOf the eight prototypes, six of them had solid construction at ground level, which meant agents didn\u2019t have visibility into Mexico. Agents said that was a major flaw because it meant they couldn\u2019t see people preparing for an attempt to jump the border, and it also gave bad actors a better chance at ambushing Border Patrol agents.\nTwo models did have slats at the base, with solid construction at the top.\nSome had protruding structures at the top that were supposed to deter climbers.\nThe CBP official said they did learn lessons from the prototypes, such as additional methods for internally hardening bollards used in fencing.\nPart of the reason the walls need to come down is that they are in the way of real fence construction. The administration is about to begin building a secondary fence in part of San Diego, and the path will run through where the prototypes were built.\nIn addition to those eight prototypes, another set was built on a separate Border Patrol site. Those were used for breach-testing. The CBP official said those already have been taken down.",

But he refused to board the plane, thwarting the effort.</p>\n<p>When ICE tried again, the man then claimed he was actually from Somalia, and renounced his Pakistani citizenship. But he refused to provide enough information to authorities to arrange his deportation to Somalia, blocking his deportation again.</p>\n<p>After more back-and-forth, he finally agreed to his Pakistani citizenship, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement once again asked the government there to take him back. As of a Homeland Security inspector general&rsquo;s review, he&rsquo;d been in custody four years.</p>\n<p>The inspector general&rsquo;s audit, released last week, showed that while arresting illegal immigrants may be a challenge these days, actually getting them to leave the U.S. can be even tougher, as officers confront balky countries overseas, legal appeals at home and the migrants&rsquo; own shenanigans.</p>\n<p>ICE sets a goal of trying to deport people within 90 days of taking them into custody. But of 13,217 people detained as of Dec. 13, 2017, 23 percent of them had already exhausted the full 90 days, and even three months after that, nearly half were still stuck in detention. Some, like the Pakistani man, wait years.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/7bb3676a-785a-45a9-bcd9-ef773ca444a8/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=720&height=405\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6af0f9bc-c323-4d45-8093-6c1d634addb9/4952.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=338&width=600\"></img></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;We give them too many bites at the apple,&rdquo; said Jessica Vaughan, an expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, who reviewed the inspector general&rsquo;s report.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Without a doubt, ICE now faces some significant challenges to removing even the most unsympathetic cases,&rdquo; Ms. Vaughan said, &ldquo;with the biggest problem being that it is too easy to abuse the overly generous due process that our courts have provided to deportable aliens.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Investigators singled out one case where a Mexican migrant had been ordered deported by an immigration judge, then challenged that in the regular courts. The migrant lost at the circuit court, ICE moved the person to a staging location in preparation for deportation.</p>\n<p>But the new location was in a different court circuit, and the migrant filed a new court challenge with the district court, lost there, and then appealed to the new circuit&rsquo;s court of appeals. As of the inspector general&rsquo;s review the migrant had been detained for more than three years, at a cost of more than $36,000 per year.</p>\n<p>Those sorts of legal delays accounted for more than half of migrants&rsquo; extended stays in detention.</p>\n<p>The second-biggest hiccup was trying to get foreign countries to accept their people back, which accounted for 31 percent of the delays, according to the audit.</p>\n<p>Investigators found a staggering 116 jurisdictions were deemed either uncooperative or &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; of failing to cooperate with U.S. deportation authorities at some point between July 2015 and May 2018. They ranged from regular thorns in the side of U.S. policy, such as China and Cuba, to usually friendly nations such as the United Kingdom, Sweden and Norway.</p>\n<p>If delays reach six months, the migrants are usually just released back into the U.S. Investigators said that happened in about 40 percent of the cases where a government was recalcitrant.</p>\n<p>Even so, that&rsquo;s likely a major improvement from the Obama years. In July 2015 ICE listed 85 countries as uncooperative or at risk. By last May that was down to 33 countries.</p>\n<p>Ms. Vaughan called that &ldquo;one of the relatively unheralded successes of the Trump administration,&rdquo; and credited Homeland Security and the State Department for being willing to punish bad-actor countries.</p>\n<p>Still, the inspector general said things could be better.</p>\n<p>Investigators said the yardsticks ICE uses to judge other countries&rsquo; cooperation &mdash; and to recommend the State Department slap visa sanctions on those who don&rsquo;t play ball &mdash; are &ldquo;not completely reliable.&rdquo; ICE also doesn&rsquo;t have a coherent method for figuring out when to end visa sanctions.</p>\n<p>For example, Guinea and Sierra Leone had some visas stripped in 2017, despite being listed only as &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; at the time. Both countries have improved and earned their way into the realm of cooperative &mdash; but remain under sanctions anyway.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile constant bad actors China, Cuba, Iran and Vietnam, regularly deemed fully uncooperative, have not been sanctioned.</p>\n<p>In one case a Cuban migrant was in detention and regularly attacked other migrants and the facility&rsquo;s staff. He was diagnosed with mental health issues.</p>\n<p>Because Cuba wouldn&rsquo;t issue documents to take him back, ICE eventually just released him.</p>\n<p>In another case a convicted sex offender from Eritrea had arrived in the U.S. as a child and didn&rsquo;t have any identity documents. He also didn&rsquo;t speak Eritrean. So when the Eritrean government interviewed him, it refused to acknowledge him as a citizen, forcing ICE to release him into the U.S.</p>\n<p>The audit also found ICE struggles to figure out the most efficient ways to deport people, picking between charter flights and commercial airlines. Some charters for high-risk deportees can take months to arrange, leading to more delays.</p>\n<p>And migrants themselves can thwart deportation by lying about their citizenship or refusing to help request travel documents from their home countries.</p>\n<p>One Indian man in the inspector general&rsquo;s audit said he didn&rsquo;t mind staying in ICE custody because it was preferable to be locked up here rather than go back to India. ICE finally got documents from India, but then encountered flight delays. The man had been in custody more than three years at the time of the audit.</p>\n<p>The inspector general studied the population in ICE detention, or what those in the industry call the &ldquo;detained docket.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Those cases are supposed to move much faster than the non-detained docket, where migrants are free in the communities, and it can take years for their cases to be decided &mdash; and they often disappear into the shadows and ignore the courts altogether.</p>\n<p>In its official response to the report, ICE said most of the hurdles the inspector general identified are out of the agency&rsquo;s control, such as relying on foreign countries or the legal system.</p>\n<p>But ICE promised to better manage its own staff levels, improve training of deportation officers and come up with a better scheduling system to streamline removals.</p>\n<p>ICE also said it will roll out a system next year that tracks how well the agency is doing in getting travel documents to facilitate deportation.</p>",

                "text": "An illegal immigrant was ordered deported in 2013, and ICE had a flight lined up to take him to Pakistan. But he refused to board the plane, thwarting the effort.\nWhen ICE tried again, the man then claimed he was actually from Somalia, and renounced his Pakistani citizenship. But he refused to provide enough information to authorities to arrange his deportation to Somalia, blocking his deportation again.\nAfter more back-and-forth, he finally agreed to his Pakistani citizenship, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement once again asked the government there to take him back. As of a Homeland Security inspector general\u2019s review, he\u2019d been in custody four years.\nThe inspector general\u2019s audit, released last week, showed that while arresting illegal immigrants may be a challenge these days, actually getting them to leave the U.S. can be even tougher, as officers confront balky countries overseas, legal appeals at home and the migrants\u2019 own shenanigans.\nICE sets a goal of trying to deport people within 90 days of taking them into custody. But of 13,217 people detained as of Dec. 13, 2017, 23 percent of them had already exhausted the full 90 days, and even three months after that, nearly half were still stuck in detention. Some, like the Pakistani man, wait years.\n\u201cWe give them too many bites at the apple,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, an expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, who reviewed the inspector general\u2019s report.\n\u201cWithout a doubt, ICE now faces some significant challenges to removing even the most unsympathetic cases,\u201d Ms. Vaughan said, \u201cwith the biggest problem being that it is too easy to abuse the overly generous due process that our courts have provided to deportable aliens.\u201d\nInvestigators singled out one case where a Mexican migrant had been ordered deported by an immigration judge, then challenged that in the regular courts. The migrant lost at the circuit court, ICE moved the person to a staging location in preparation for deportation.\nBut the new location was in a different court circuit, and the migrant filed a new court challenge with the district court, lost there, and then appealed to the new circuit\u2019s court of appeals. As of the inspector general\u2019s review the migrant had been detained for more than three years, at a cost of more than $36,000 per year.\nThose sorts of legal delays accounted for more than half of migrants\u2019 extended stays in detention.\nThe second-biggest hiccup was trying to get foreign countries to accept their people back, which accounted for 31 percent of the delays, according to the audit.\nInvestigators found a staggering 116 jurisdictions were deemed either uncooperative or \u201cat risk\u201d of failing to cooperate with U.S. deportation authorities at some point between July 2015 and May 2018. They ranged from regular thorns in the side of U.S. policy, such as China and Cuba, to usually friendly nations such as the United Kingdom, Sweden and Norway.\nIf delays reach six months, the migrants are usually just released back into the U.S. Investigators said that happened in about 40 percent of the cases where a government was recalcitrant.\nEven so, that\u2019s likely a major improvement from the Obama years. In July 2015 ICE listed 85 countries as uncooperative or at risk. By last May that was down to 33 countries.\nMs. Vaughan called that \u201cone of the relatively unheralded successes of the Trump administration,\u201d and credited Homeland Security and the State Department for being willing to punish bad-actor countries.\nStill, the inspector general said things could be better.\nInvestigators said the yardsticks ICE uses to judge other countries\u2019 cooperation \u2014 and to recommend the State Department slap visa sanctions on those who don\u2019t play ball \u2014 are \u201cnot completely reliable.\u201d ICE also doesn\u2019t have a coherent method for figuring out when to end visa sanctions.\nFor example, Guinea and Sierra Leone had some visas stripped in 2017, despite being listed only as \u201cat risk\u201d at the time. Both countries have improved and earned their way into the realm of cooperative \u2014 but remain under sanctions anyway.\nMeanwhile constant bad actors China, Cuba, Iran and Vietnam, regularly deemed fully uncooperative, have not been sanctioned.\nIn one case a Cuban migrant was in detention and regularly attacked other migrants and the facility\u2019s staff. He was diagnosed with mental health issues.\nBecause Cuba wouldn\u2019t issue documents to take him back, ICE eventually just released him.\nIn another case a convicted sex offender from Eritrea had arrived in the U.S. as a child and didn\u2019t have any identity documents. He also didn\u2019t speak Eritrean. So when the Eritrean government interviewed him, it refused to acknowledge him as a citizen, forcing ICE to release him into the U.S.\nThe audit also found ICE struggles to figure out the most efficient ways to deport people, picking between charter flights and commercial airlines. Some charters for high-risk deportees can take months to arrange, leading to more delays.\nAnd migrants themselves can thwart deportation by lying about their citizenship or refusing to help request travel documents from their home countries.\nOne Indian man in the inspector general\u2019s audit said he didn\u2019t mind staying in ICE custody because it was preferable to be locked up here rather than go back to India. ICE finally got documents from India, but then encountered flight delays. The man had been in custody more than three years at the time of the audit.\nThe inspector general studied the population in ICE detention, or what those in the industry call the \u201cdetained docket.\u201d\nThose cases are supposed to move much faster than the non-detained docket, where migrants are free in the communities, and it can take years for their cases to be decided \u2014 and they often disappear into the shadows and ignore the courts altogether.\nIn its official response to the report, ICE said most of the hurdles the inspector general identified are out of the agency\u2019s control, such as relying on foreign countries or the legal system.\nBut ICE promised to better manage its own staff levels, improve training of deportation officers and come up with a better scheduling system to streamline removals.\nICE also said it will roll out a system next year that tracks how well the agency is doing in getting travel documents to facilitate deportation.",

Ilhan Omar&rsquo;s loyalty because she wears a Muslim head covering. Fox hasn&rsquo;t explained the former New York-area district attorney&rsquo;s absence, declining to comment on &ldquo;internal scheduling matters.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The network&rsquo;s schedule for the upcoming weekend lists another program in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeanine-pirro/\">Pirro</a>&rsquo;s time slot.</p>\n<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation&rsquo;s largest Muslim civil rights organization, this week said that advertisers should boycott Fox News until <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeanine-pirro/\">Pirro</a> and prime-time host Tucker Carlson were fired.

In its online message, Act for America said that instead of rewarding its anchor for opening a much-needed debate, &ldquo;Fox News caved to pressure from the radical left.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeanine-pirro/\">Jeanine Pirro</a> did nothing wrong,&rdquo; the group&rsquo;s leader, Brigitte Gabriel, said via tweet. &ldquo;People should be outraged.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Act for America has been listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for anti-Muslim rhetoric. Gabriel has tweeted in recent days that she considered SPLC a hate group.</p>\n<p>Act for America said more than 20,000 people have responded to its request to email Scott. Fox News had no comment on the campaign Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Act for America was echoing tweets by President Donald Trump last weekend. He had also proclaimed his support for <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeanine-pirro/\">Pirro</a> and advocated for her reinstatement.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeanine-pirro/\">Pirro</a> has issued one statement through Fox, saying she did not call Omar un-American and that &ldquo;my intention was to ask a question and start a debate, but of course because one is Muslim does not mean you don&rsquo;t support the Constitution.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gabriel had appeared with <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeanine-pirro/\">Pirro</a> last Friday on the online Fox Nation service, where the advocacy group leader referred to Omar and a colleague, Rep. Rashida Talib, as anti-Semitic, in a transcript provided by the liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America. Of the two representatives, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeanine-pirro/\">Pirro</a> said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s almost as though they think they&rsquo;re representing another country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gabriel also criticized Fox in the wake of its hiring Monday of former Democratic National Committee chief Donna Brazile as a political commentator.</p>\n<p>Between the suspension of <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeanine-pirro/\">Pirro</a> and hiring of Brazile, &ldquo;if that doesn&rsquo;t show you the direction Fox News is headed I don&rsquo;t know what will,&rdquo; she tweeted.</p>",

                "text": "NEW YORK \u2014 The apparent suspension of Jeanine Pirro is squeezing Fox News Channel in two directions.\nA prominent Muslim-American civil rights organization is calling for advertisers to boycott Fox News, while another group is petitioning to have the weekend host reinstated.\nPirro wasn\u2019t on the air Saturday, a week after Fox publicly condemned her for comments questioning U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar\u2019s loyalty because she wears a Muslim head covering. Fox hasn\u2019t explained the former New York-area district attorney\u2019s absence, declining to comment on \u201cinternal scheduling matters.\u201d\nThe network\u2019s schedule for the upcoming weekend lists another program in Pirro\u2019s time slot.\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation\u2019s largest Muslim civil rights organization, this week said that advertisers should boycott Fox News until Pirro and prime-time host Tucker Carlson were fired. Carlson has been fighting back since being criticized last week for comments made on a radio show a decade ago and unearthed last week.\nMeanwhile, the lobbying group Act for America urged its members write to Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott to complain about Pirro\u2019s absence. In its online message, Act for America said that instead of rewarding its anchor for opening a much-needed debate, \u201cFox News caved to pressure from the radical left.\u201d\n\u201cJeanine Pirro did nothing wrong,\u201d the group\u2019s leader, Brigitte Gabriel, said via tweet. \u201cPeople should be outraged.\u201d\nAct for America has been listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for anti-Muslim rhetoric. Gabriel has tweeted in recent days that she considered SPLC a hate group.\nAct for America said more than 20,000 people have responded to its request to email Scott. Fox News had no comment on the campaign Tuesday.\nAct for America was echoing tweets by President Donald Trump last weekend. He had also proclaimed his support for Pirro and advocated for her reinstatement.\nPirro has issued one statement through Fox, saying she did not call Omar un-American and that \u201cmy intention was to ask a question and start a debate, but of course because one is Muslim does not mean you don\u2019t support the Constitution.\u201d\nGabriel had appeared with Pirro last Friday on the online Fox Nation service, where the advocacy group leader referred to Omar and a colleague, Rep. Rashida Talib, as anti-Semitic, in a transcript provided by the liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America. Of the two representatives, Pirro said, \u201cit\u2019s almost as though they think they\u2019re representing another country.\u201d\nGabriel also criticized Fox in the wake of its hiring Monday of former Democratic National Committee chief Donna Brazile as a political commentator.\nBetween the suspension of Pirro and hiring of Brazile, \u201cif that doesn\u2019t show you the direction Fox News is headed I don\u2019t know what will,\u201d she tweeted.",

Lindsey Graham slammed progressives Tuesday for pushing to end the Electoral College system, suggesting they want to do away with middle America.\n\u201cThe desire to abolish the Electoral College is driven by the idea Democrats want rural America to go away politically,\u201d the South Carolina Republican tweeted.\nHis comment comes in response to 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who said in a town hall hosted by CNN Monday the system by which Americans have elected presidents for the past 230 years must come to an end.\n\u201cThat means getting rid of the Electoral College,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat said.\n\u201cEverybody ought to come here and ask for your vote,\u201d she told the Mississippi crowd.\nPresident George W. Bush won the 2000 election against former Vice President Al Gore via the Electoral College, as did President Trump against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016. Both men lost the popular vote.\nProgressive voters, still sour over the 2016 upset, are pushing Democrats to eliminate the system laid out in the Constitution for electing the president and vice president.",

But if ICE didn&rsquo;t immediately arrest them, the migrants must be given a chance to make bond.</p>\n<p>The case turned on a phrase in the law that says the no-bail determination applies to someone picked up by ICE &ldquo;when the alien is released&rdquo; from prison or jail. The <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/us-circuit-court-of-appeals/\">lower court</a> ruled &ldquo;when&rdquo; must mean the day of release.</p>\n<p>But Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing the majority opinion, said that could create a new loophole for sanctuary cities, which often refuse to alert ICE officers when releasing people from their local prisons and jails.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/7bb3676a-785a-45a9-bcd9-ef773ca444a8/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=720&height=405\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6af0f9bc-c323-4d45-8093-6c1d634addb9/4952.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=338&width=600\"></img></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;Under these circumstances, it is hard to believe that Congress made the secretary&rsquo;s mandatory-detention authority vanish at the stroke of midnight after an alien&rsquo;s release,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>\n<p>He said it made more sense that &ldquo;when&rdquo; means at some point after the release, not at the exact moment of it.</p>\n<p>While many immigrants living in the U.S. illegally are released while they await their court proceedings and possible deportation, Congress has deemed some serious criminals to be such safety risks that they must be held by ICE while their cases proceed.</p>\n<p>Those are the ones affected by Tuesday&rsquo;s ruling.</p>\n<p>The American Civil Liberties Union, which had represented the migrants challenging their detention, criticized the <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/us-circuit-court-of-appeals/\">court</a>&rsquo;s decision.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For two terms in a row now, the Supreme Court has endorsed the most extreme interpretation of immigration detention statutes, allowing mass incarceration of people without any hearing, simply because they are defending themselves against a deportation charge,&rdquo; said Cecillia Wang, the ACLU&rsquo;s deputy director.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/us-circuit-court-of-appeals/\">court</a>&rsquo;s four Democratic-appointed justices dissented from Tuesday&rsquo;s decision, saying if Congress had intended to require all serious criminal migrants to be denied bail, regardless of when they were arrested, it would have said that.</p>\n<p>The case was limited to the reading of the law and what Congress intended, and did not broach bigger questions about the constitutionality of no-bail proceedings. Justice Alito said &ldquo;as-applied&rdquo; challenges to how the administration carries out the law can still be brought.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. They said the lower courts shouldn&rsquo;t have even got involved in the case because Congress has specifically precluded jurisdiction over these kinds of detention decisions. But since the <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/us-circuit-court-of-appeals/\">court</a> was involved, they said they generally agreed with Justice Alito&rsquo;s conclusions.</p>",

But if ICE didn\u2019t immediately arrest them, the migrants must be given a chance to make bond.\nThe case turned on a phrase in the law that says the no-bail determination applies to someone picked up by ICE \u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d from prison or jail. The lower court ruled \u201cwhen\u201d must mean the day of release.\nBut Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing the majority opinion, said that could create a new loophole for sanctuary cities, which often refuse to alert ICE officers when releasing people from their local prisons and jails.\n\u201cUnder these circumstances, it is hard to believe that Congress made the secretary\u2019s mandatory-detention authority vanish at the stroke of midnight after an alien\u2019s release,\u201d he wrote.\nHe said it made more sense that \u201cwhen\u201d means at some point after the release, not at the exact moment of it.\nWhile many immigrants living in the U.S. illegally are released while they await their court proceedings and possible deportation, Congress has deemed some serious criminals to be such safety risks that they must be held by ICE while their cases proceed.\nThose are the ones affected by Tuesday\u2019s ruling.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which had represented the migrants challenging their detention, criticized the court\u2019s decision.\n\u201cFor two terms in a row now, the Supreme Court has endorsed the most extreme interpretation of immigration detention statutes, allowing mass incarceration of people without any hearing, simply because they are defending themselves against a deportation charge,\u201d said Cecillia Wang, the ACLU\u2019s deputy director.\nThe court\u2019s four Democratic-appointed justices dissented from Tuesday\u2019s decision, saying if Congress had intended to require all serious criminal migrants to be denied bail, regardless of when they were arrested, it would have said that.\nThe case was limited to the reading of the law and what Congress intended, and did not broach bigger questions about the constitutionality of no-bail proceedings. Justice Alito said \u201cas-applied\u201d challenges to how the administration carries out the law can still be brought.\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. They said the lower courts shouldn\u2019t have even got involved in the case because Congress has specifically precluded jurisdiction over these kinds of detention decisions. But since the court was involved, they said they generally agreed with Justice Alito\u2019s conclusions.",

It surpassed its Asian rival to the east a decade ago in total gross domestic product to become the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy, with its sights trained squarely on the United States.</p>\n<p>Indeed, judged by what economists call purchasing power parity &mdash; the idea that services such as a haircut are valued equally &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/\">Beijing</a> already can claim the title of the world&rsquo;s largest economy.</p>\n<p>But the sputtering Chinese-driven train appears to have pulled into the station. Growth targets have been slashed. Exports have fallen. Debt levels are rising. Some economists even say <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> is in a recession.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is true that <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a>&rsquo;s economy has encountered new, downward pressure,&rdquo; Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters last week at the conclusion of the annual National People&rsquo;s Congress gathering in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/\">Beijing</a>. Faced with growing pressures within and without, the government said it plans to create more than 11 million jobs this year to avoid a politically disruptive slowdown.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/213752ad-8d24-4bca-8633-825848bc248e/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=720&height=405\"></img></a></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6af0f9bc-c323-4d45-8093-6c1d634addb9/4956.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=338&width=600\"></img></figure>\n<p>Mr. Li used unusually stark language to describe the challenges <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> faces. He said government planners at all levels need to &ldquo;turn the blade inward&rdquo; and &ldquo;cut our own wrists&rdquo; to carry out the sacrifices needed to keep the economy afloat.</p>\n<p>In the long-run competition between the U.S. and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> for economic supremacy, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said he is betting on the U.S.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t like the Chinese have a free ride for the next 20 or 30 years,&rdquo; Mr. Dimon said in an interview this week with CNN.</p>\n<p>A recent visit to <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> reveals how a confluence of factors &mdash; not least the Trump administration&rsquo;s trade war and demands for deep changes in the way the Asian giant does business &mdash; has put the nation&rsquo;s economic model, so successful over the past 40 years, in real peril.</p>\n<p><strong>The &lsquo;world&rsquo;s factory&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>In 1978, Deng Xiaoping and his fellow reformers in the ruling Communist Party inherited an economy &mdash; and society &mdash; all but ruined by Mao Zedong.</p>\n<p>In the 19th century, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> was one of the world&rsquo;s richest, most productive economies. But by the end of Mao&rsquo;s disastrous 27-year reign of collectivization, state command and brutality, the country was deeply impoverished, barely able to feed itself. During the grim, ironically named Great Leap Forward, a period of mass collectivization that lasted from 1958 to 1962, tens of millions died of starvation as <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a>&rsquo;s agricultural sector was devastated.</p>\n<p>Deng commenced <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;reform and opening-up,&rdquo; a shift still widely celebrated in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> &mdash; a bright red sign flying in Tiananmen Square marks the recent 40th anniversary of the inauguration of the policy. While retaining strict political control, Deng legalized entrepreneurship and liberated the peasants who had been forced onto Mao&rsquo;s collectivized farms. Perhaps most crucial, Deng permitted foreign investment, though only as part of joint ventures with Chinese companies.</p>\n<p>It was that last decision that many credit with providing the underpinning for the wildly successful Chinese development model of the subsequent four decades. Foreign investors found <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> to be an enticing manufacturing base, boasting a massive workforce willing to work for pennies on the dollar.</p>\n<p>Factory investment surged along with exports. Chinese exports, produced for a fraction of the cost of goods produced in other countries, were able to compete on price if not quality. <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a>&rsquo;s 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization only served to further <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a>&rsquo;s emergence as the world&rsquo;s factory floor, signaling profound disruptions in the economies across Asia, Europe and the Americas.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Chinese government recirculated the cash it vacuumed up from overseas exports into investment. During the 2009 financial crisis, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/\">Beijing</a>&rsquo;s leaders had the firepower to unleash a massive construction boom that kept the economy humming even as much of the world fell into a recession.</p>\n<p>The United States, as the world&rsquo;s largest consuming nation, has been a particularly attractive target for Chinese exports. In 2006, the U.S. imported $343 billion worth of Chinese products. By 2017, that number had leaped to $522.9 billion, according to U.S. government data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> was steadily moving up the supply chain.</p>\n<p>No longer just the world leader in producing cheap plastic junk, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> had top exports in 2017 that included mobile phones, computers, computer parts and integrated circuits. U.S. exports to <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> that year amounted to a mere $187.5 billion, resulting in a $335.4 billion trade gap.</p>\n<p>It is this severe trade imbalance that President Trump has sought to redress by imposing tariffs on scores of Chinese exports &mdash; so far targeting about $250 billion worth of Chinese imports &mdash; hitting various sectors such as solar panels, washing machines and dental fillings.</p>\n<p>The tariffs serve two purposes for the economic nationalist president. For one, they encourage manufacturers to set up shop in the U.S. by undercutting <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a>&rsquo;s competitive cost advantage.</p>\n<p>U.S. officials say the tariffs have been useful for pressuring <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/\">Beijing</a> to change its behavior on other fronts, including North Korea, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and myriad other restrictions on foreign companies operating in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a>. Chinese companies operating in the U.S. market are not subject to such restrictions.</p>\n<p>Despite widespread skepticism among economists that Mr. Trump&rsquo;s tariffs are simply taxes on American consumers, there is strong evidence that they have had some success in hobbling the Chinese export-oriented development model.</p>\n<p>Gordon Chang, a longtime <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> watcher and author of &ldquo;The Coming Collapse of <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a>,&rdquo; said Chinese exporters are absorbing more than 80 percent of the costs of U.S. tariffs related to intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It makes sense that desperate Chinese exporters are willing to pay a good portion of the tariffs to preserve market share,&rdquo; Mr. Chang said.</p>\n<p>But even as Chinese economic officials try to stave off the effects of the U.S. tariffs, exports have swooned. Chinese exports to the United States were down 14.1 percent in the first two months of 2019 compared with the previous year. The falloff has dragged down the Chinese economy as a whole.</p>\n<p>The trade dispute has &ldquo;negatively impacted consumer confidence,&rdquo; said Jake Parker of the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing.</p>\n<p><strong>Target shooting</strong></p>\n<p>For years, the Chinese economy was essentially the world&rsquo;s most successful target shooter.</p>\n<p>Each year, the central government would set a &ldquo;target&rdquo; for GDP growth. And each year, like clockwork, the economy would hit the bull&rsquo;s-eye &mdash; or so the official data said. In the heady three decades after Deng&rsquo;s reforms took hold, GDP growth routinely topped 10 percent. Even since 2010, the target range was still a lofty 8 percent while U.S. annual growth never topped 3 percent.</p>\n<p>But this year, the government has set a target of just 6 percent GDP growth, which is evidence of a stark slowdown.</p>\n<p>Even the 6 percent growth may be a mirage, whatever the official numbers show.</p>\n<p>Tony Nash, managing partner at economic forecasting firm Complete Intelligence with deep experience in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a>, called the Beijing government&rsquo;s official figures &ldquo;a Potemkin village, simply presented for the impression.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is done because the expectations of 8 percent growth, for example, was set more than a decade ago in order to create enough jobs for the workforce,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a high bar to achieve, but it&rsquo;s also a higher expectation to overcome.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University, said he estimated that Chinese real GDP growth is only about half of what official figures indicate.</p>\n<p>In Baoding, an industrial city about 100 miles southwest of <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/\">Beijing</a>, an industrial park manufacturing solar panels continues to operate despite the financial woes of Yingli Solar, one of the world&rsquo;s biggest panel manufacturers. (Solar panels are targeted by Mr. Trump&rsquo;s tariffs.)</p>\n<p>In the midst of a major debt restructuring, Yingli is likely now serving only the domestic market and thus would be hit by any reduction in domestic investment. The company declined to speak to the media.</p>\n<p>Still, like many other Chinese cities, Baoding has the appearance of a boomtown regardless of the underlying health of the economy. Cranes are everywhere. Glistening new malls stacked with Western stores are packed with shoppers.</p>\n<p>Foreign firms continue to chase <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a>&rsquo;s vast consumer market. Pan Chenyin, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> manager at Fireworks, a digital technology company that helps promote consumer brands, observed that &ldquo;with the growing of the middle class, domestic consumer consumption is taking up a considerable amount of <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a>&rsquo;s economy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Despite the U.S.-<a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> trade hostilities, he said, &ldquo;I feel the spirit is high.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Pan reports that leading consumer brands continue to increase their spending in <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> and that his firm is seeing 20 percent year-on-year growth &mdash; even in the midst of the slowdown.</p>\n<p><strong>Consumer focus</strong></p>\n<p>That is encouraging news for <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a>&rsquo;s economic planners, who are hoping to use the export slowdown to achieve their long-held goal of turning the country into more of a consumer-driven economy that is less dependent on exports and investments. Particularly with exports in trouble, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> is &ldquo;dependent on increasing investment for growth,&rdquo; Peking University&rsquo;s Mr. Pettis said. But the heavy influence of the government on the economy continues to hold <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> back.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Because so much of that investment is &lsquo;wasted&rsquo; on nonproductive or unnecessary infrastructure and real estate projects, and on excess capacity &hellip; debt is rising so much faster than their ability to service the debt.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>To get consumers to buy more, the Chinese government recently cut the national sales tax. But there is much more it could do, Mr. Pettis said. He suggested that local governments &ldquo;lower fees for residents, for example car licenses, electricity, water &hellip; or lower costs for public transportation&rdquo; to spur consumption.</p>\n<p>One looming thundercloud is the possibility that Mr. Trump will increase tariffs. That would hurt exports further and depress consumer confidence.</p>\n<p>Heated trade talks between <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> and the United States continue. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer reportedly are planning another trip to <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/\">Beijing</a> next week. Mr. Trump has already delayed further tariffs once, but there is a clear concern that the mercurial American president is growing impatient.</p>\n<p>Not long ago, there was a sense that Mr. Trump, operating in a slapdash manner and desperate for any form of &ldquo;win,&rdquo; would capitulate on the thorniest issues, including technology transfers and intellectual property protections. One official, who spoke in an unofficial and anonymous capacity, was gleeful in predicting that <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> would stare down the U.S. president and win.</p>\n<p>But Mr. Trump&rsquo;s abrupt exit from the Hanoi talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has shaken that confidence and demonstrated, in fact, that Mr. Trump is willing to walk away from a deal that doesn&rsquo;t suit him.</p>\n<p>Still, the Chinese are putting on a brave face and predicting that the two sides will eventually cut a deal. At the same time, they are sounding a more conciliatory note than they did before the Hanoi summit.</p>\n<p>Shen Dingli, a professor at Fudan University, is typically a reliable voice of the Chinese establishment and is known for his hawkish take on Chinese economic relations with Washington. These days, Mr. Shen sounds downright dovish. He is forecasting a &ldquo;win-win, no-losers outcome&rdquo; to Mr. Trump&rsquo;s trade offensive.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The U.S. will get more and better access to Chinese markets with more equal treatment of competition of export as well as investment,&rdquo; he said, while &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/\">China</a> will be able to maintain its current exports and even increase its exports.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "BEIJING \u2014 Since the 2009 global financial crisis hobbled most of the world\u2019s developed countries, China has been the economic locomotive pulling the rest of the world behind it.\nAs the economies of Europe, the U.S. and Japan stagnated, China went from strength to strength. It surpassed its Asian rival to the east a decade ago in total gross domestic product to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy, with its sights trained squarely on the United States.\nIndeed, judged by what economists call purchasing power parity \u2014 the idea that services such as a haircut are valued equally \u2014 Beijing already can claim the title of the world\u2019s largest economy.\nBut the sputtering Chinese-driven train appears to have pulled into the station. Growth targets have been slashed. Exports have fallen. Debt levels are rising. Some economists even say China is in a recession.\n\u201cIt is true that China\u2019s economy has encountered new, downward pressure,\u201d Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters last week at the conclusion of the annual National People\u2019s Congress gathering in Beijing. Faced with growing pressures within and without, the government said it plans to create more than 11 million jobs this year to avoid a politically disruptive slowdown.\nMr. Li used unusually stark language to describe the challenges China faces. He said government planners at all levels need to \u201cturn the blade inward\u201d and \u201ccut our own wrists\u201d to carry out the sacrifices needed to keep the economy afloat.\nIn the long-run competition between the U.S. and China for economic supremacy, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said he is betting on the U.S.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t like the Chinese have a free ride for the next 20 or 30 years,\u201d Mr. Dimon said in an interview this week with CNN.\nA recent visit to China reveals how a confluence of factors \u2014 not least the Trump administration\u2019s trade war and demands for deep changes in the way the Asian giant does business \u2014 has put the nation\u2019s economic model, so successful over the past 40 years, in real peril.\nThe \u2018world\u2019s factory\u2019\nIn 1978, Deng Xiaoping and his fellow reformers in the ruling Communist Party inherited an economy \u2014 and society \u2014 all but ruined by Mao Zedong.\nIn the 19th century, China was one of the world\u2019s richest, most productive economies. But by the end of Mao\u2019s disastrous 27-year reign of collectivization, state command and brutality, the country was deeply impoverished, barely able to feed itself. During the grim, ironically named Great Leap Forward, a period of mass collectivization that lasted from 1958 to 1962, tens of millions died of starvation as China\u2019s agricultural sector was devastated.\nDeng commenced China\u2019s \u201creform and opening-up,\u201d a shift still widely celebrated in China \u2014 a bright red sign flying in Tiananmen Square marks the recent 40th anniversary of the inauguration of the policy. While retaining strict political control, Deng legalized entrepreneurship and liberated the peasants who had been forced onto Mao\u2019s collectivized farms. Perhaps most crucial, Deng permitted foreign investment, though only as part of joint ventures with Chinese companies.\nIt was that last decision that many credit with providing the underpinning for the wildly successful Chinese development model of the subsequent four decades. Foreign investors found China to be an enticing manufacturing base, boasting a massive workforce willing to work for pennies on the dollar.\nFactory investment surged along with exports. Chinese exports, produced for a fraction of the cost of goods produced in other countries, were able to compete on price if not quality. China\u2019s 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization only served to further China\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s factory floor, signaling profound disruptions in the economies across Asia, Europe and the Americas.\nMeanwhile, the Chinese government recirculated the cash it vacuumed up from overseas exports into investment. During the 2009 financial crisis, Beijing\u2019s leaders had the firepower to unleash a massive construction boom that kept the economy humming even as much of the world fell into a recession.\nThe United States, as the world\u2019s largest consuming nation, has been a particularly attractive target for Chinese exports. In 2006, the U.S. imported $343 billion worth of Chinese products. By 2017, that number had leaped to $522.9 billion, according to U.S. government data.\nChina was steadily moving up the supply chain.\nNo longer just the world leader in producing cheap plastic junk, China had top exports in 2017 that included mobile phones, computers, computer parts and integrated circuits. U.S. exports to China that year amounted to a mere $187.5 billion, resulting in a $335.4 billion trade gap.\nIt is this severe trade imbalance that President Trump has sought to redress by imposing tariffs on scores of Chinese exports \u2014 so far targeting about $250 billion worth of Chinese imports \u2014 hitting various sectors such as solar panels, washing machines and dental fillings.\nThe tariffs serve two purposes for the economic nationalist president. For one, they encourage manufacturers to set up shop in the U.S. by undercutting China\u2019s competitive cost advantage.\nU.S. officials say the tariffs have been useful for pressuring Beijing to change its behavior on other fronts, including North Korea, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and myriad other restrictions on foreign companies operating in China. Chinese companies operating in the U.S. market are not subject to such restrictions.\nDespite widespread skepticism among economists that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs are simply taxes on American consumers, there is strong evidence that they have had some success in hobbling the Chinese export-oriented development model.\nGordon Chang, a longtime China watcher and author of \u201cThe Coming Collapse of China,\u201d said Chinese exporters are absorbing more than 80 percent of the costs of U.S. tariffs related to intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers.\n\u201cIt makes sense that desperate Chinese exporters are willing to pay a good portion of the tariffs to preserve market share,\u201d Mr. Chang said.\nBut even as Chinese economic officials try to stave off the effects of the U.S. tariffs, exports have swooned. Chinese exports to the United States were down 14.1 percent in the first two months of 2019 compared with the previous year. The falloff has dragged down the Chinese economy as a whole.\nThe trade dispute has \u201cnegatively impacted consumer confidence,\u201d said Jake Parker of the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing.\nTarget shooting\nFor years, the Chinese economy was essentially the world\u2019s most successful target shooter.\nEach year, the central government would set a \u201ctarget\u201d for GDP growth. And each year, like clockwork, the economy would hit the bull\u2019s-eye \u2014 or so the official data said. In the heady three decades after Deng\u2019s reforms took hold, GDP growth routinely topped 10 percent. Even since 2010, the target range was still a lofty 8 percent while U.S. annual growth never topped 3 percent.\nBut this year, the government has set a target of just 6 percent GDP growth, which is evidence of a stark slowdown.\nEven the 6 percent growth may be a mirage, whatever the official numbers show.\nTony Nash, managing partner at economic forecasting firm Complete Intelligence with deep experience in China, called the Beijing government\u2019s official figures \u201ca Potemkin village, simply presented for the impression.\u201d\n\u201cThis is done because the expectations of 8 percent growth, for example, was set more than a decade ago in order to create enough jobs for the workforce,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a high bar to achieve, but it\u2019s also a higher expectation to overcome.\u201d\nMichael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University, said he estimated that Chinese real GDP growth is only about half of what official figures indicate.\nIn Baoding, an industrial city about 100 miles southwest of Beijing, an industrial park manufacturing solar panels continues to operate despite the financial woes of Yingli Solar, one of the world\u2019s biggest panel manufacturers. (Solar panels are targeted by Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs.)\nIn the midst of a major debt restructuring, Yingli is likely now serving only the domestic market and thus would be hit by any reduction in domestic investment. The company declined to speak to the media.\nStill, like many other Chinese cities, Baoding has the appearance of a boomtown regardless of the underlying health of the economy. Cranes are everywhere. Glistening new malls stacked with Western stores are packed with shoppers.\nForeign firms continue to chase China\u2019s vast consumer market. Pan Chenyin, China manager at Fireworks, a digital technology company that helps promote consumer brands, observed that \u201cwith the growing of the middle class, domestic consumer consumption is taking up a considerable amount of China\u2019s economy.\u201d\nDespite the U.S.-China trade hostilities, he said, \u201cI feel the spirit is high.\u201d\nMr. Pan reports that leading consumer brands continue to increase their spending in China and that his firm is seeing 20 percent year-on-year growth \u2014 even in the midst of the slowdown.\nConsumer focus\nThat is encouraging news for China\u2019s economic planners, who are hoping to use the export slowdown to achieve their long-held goal of turning the country into more of a consumer-driven economy that is less dependent on exports and investments. Particularly with exports in trouble, China is \u201cdependent on increasing investment for growth,\u201d Peking University\u2019s Mr. Pettis said. But the heavy influence of the government on the economy continues to hold China back.\n\u201cBecause so much of that investment is \u2018wasted\u2019 on nonproductive or unnecessary infrastructure and real estate projects, and on excess capacity \u2026 debt is rising so much faster than their ability to service the debt.\u201d\nTo get consumers to buy more, the Chinese government recently cut the national sales tax. But there is much more it could do, Mr. Pettis said. He suggested that local governments \u201clower fees for residents, for example car licenses, electricity, water \u2026 or lower costs for public transportation\u201d to spur consumption.\nOne looming thundercloud is the possibility that Mr. Trump will increase tariffs. That would hurt exports further and depress consumer confidence.\nHeated trade talks between China and the United States continue. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer reportedly are planning another trip to Beijing next week. Mr. Trump has already delayed further tariffs once, but there is a clear concern that the mercurial American president is growing impatient.\nNot long ago, there was a sense that Mr. Trump, operating in a slapdash manner and desperate for any form of \u201cwin,\u201d would capitulate on the thorniest issues, including technology transfers and intellectual property protections. One official, who spoke in an unofficial and anonymous capacity, was gleeful in predicting that China would stare down the U.S. president and win.\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt exit from the Hanoi talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has shaken that confidence and demonstrated, in fact, that Mr. Trump is willing to walk away from a deal that doesn\u2019t suit him.\nStill, the Chinese are putting on a brave face and predicting that the two sides will eventually cut a deal. At the same time, they are sounding a more conciliatory note than they did before the Hanoi summit.\nShen Dingli, a professor at Fudan University, is typically a reliable voice of the Chinese establishment and is known for his hawkish take on Chinese economic relations with Washington. These days, Mr. Shen sounds downright dovish. He is forecasting a \u201cwin-win, no-losers outcome\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s trade offensive.\n\u201cThe U.S. will get more and better access to Chinese markets with more equal treatment of competition of export as well as investment,\u201d he said, while \u201cChina will be able to maintain its current exports and even increase its exports.\u201d",

Her latest violent assault on all things holy? She announced last week she'd pay even the entry-level members of her congressional staff enough that they<a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-call-living-wage-starts-office\"> won't have to take second jobs</a> and burn out trying to make rent. What is this country coming to, we ask you?</p>\n<p>Needless to say, Fox News was <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/fox-news-aoc-living-wage-communist\">simply outraged</a> by the very idea that a member of Congress would decide to make a somewhat unconventional choice about how to spend the fixed pile of money each member is allotted to pay staff, because <em>what the hell is even wrong with that lady and WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK!</em> Here, just look at the socialist horror of people being paid enough to live on, from Sunday's &quot;Fox &amp; Friends.&quot; If you can even bear to hear about the destruction of a once-great nation, that is.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQHBiLT0auc?rel=0\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>As <em>GQ's</em> Luke Darby <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/fox-news-aoc-living-wage-communist\">notes,</a> it's almost as if Fox News &quot;knows that it's fighting on the side of wildly unpopular ideas.&quot; Host Griff Jenkins appears to be reduced to simply giving an accurate description of AOC's ideas, but &quot;in an outraged voice, so that the audience understands the aforementioned ideas and actions are, somehow, unreasonable.&quot; So <em>obviously </em>there has to be something un-American going on here:</p>\n<blockquote> Get a load of this. A tweet went out yesterday -- she said &quot;Leadership begins at home&quot; or whatever, however she put it -- she basically announced that she is <em>going </em>to <em>redistribute </em>the money appropriated to her congressional office to make sure that entry-level staffers get a fair share of money. </blockquote>\n<p>Is this even the USA anymore? Next you'll be seeing a dusky-hued president wearing a tan suit, or even worse. Fellow couch-sitter Pete Hegseth was astonished that anyone might cap the salary of the most important people in an office so that those at the lowest levels could receive a living wage.</p>\n<blockquote> She said everyone in my office will pay a living wage [...] Your entry-level intern is making 52 grand, while your chief of staff\u2015who has a very important role in a congressional office\u2015now is capped at 80, as opposed to the actual market rate on Capitol Hill which is closer to $150,000. So everyone's between 52 and 80. It's actually socialism and communism on display.</blockquote>\n<p>Hegseth is actually conflating a couple things there, by the way -- Ocasio-Cortez <a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-call-living-wage-starts-office\">said in December</a> that interns should be paid $15 an hour plus benefits, which would come out to only about $31K a year gross if they work the standard 2,087 hours a year -- and we suspect congressional interns might not? The $52K floor would be for full-time staffers, if anyone cares. But the real point is that if people at the very top aren't paid far more than those at the bottom, it's definitely communism, because words stopped meaning anything back in 2016 anyway.</p>\n<p>Also, Pete, please <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/pete-hegseth-man-of-science-would-have-saved-v-a-so-much-on-soap\">wash your fucking hands,</a> you disgusting pig. Or is basic hygiene socialism, too?</p>\n<p>Ocasio-Cortez, as ever, seems more amused than anything at the pushback to paying a living wage.</p>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1100038138938966017\"><p>The GOP is so disconnected from the basic idea that people should be paid enough to live that Fox actually thinks m&hellip; https://t.co/4nL1qaSvoT</p> &mdash; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/statuses/1100038138938966017\">1551104504.0</a></blockquote>\n<p>That's because she hates America. She's even brainwashed her staff with her wild-eyed notion that folks at the top might agree to limits in order to help those lower down in the org chart, because socialism takes over your brain with<a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/fox-news-sick-of-schools-teaching-socialist-doctrines-like-fairness\"> un-American notions of &quot;fairness.&quot;</a> Her comms director, Corbin Trent, said some pretty insane things to <a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-call-living-wage-starts-office\">Roll Call,</a> because the virus of egalitarianism has clearly wormed its way into the brains of all these monsters:</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;We think that if a person is working, they should make enough to live&quot; [...] <br><br>Trent acknowledged that some people would have to take pay cuts to work in the office. He said that was a trade-off that employees had been willing to make: &quot;I don't think you always put the burden on the bottom.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>Then the entire Ocasio-Cortez staff vowed their allegiance to Satan and promised they would come for your children, the end.</p>\n<p>As proof that a &quot;living wage&quot; is nothing more than communism, we would add that when Yr Editrix hired Yr Dok Zoom as a full-time writer in 2014, she insisted on paying us enough to live on and buy health insurance (and once she could, took over the health insurance like a common POL POT).

                "text": "Good lord, that monster Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seems determined to wreck America by utterly destroying our beloved institutions and traditions. Her latest violent assault on all things holy? She announced last week she'd pay even the entry-level members of her congressional staff enough that they won't have to take second jobs and burn out trying to make rent. What is this country coming to, we ask you?\nNeedless to say, Fox News was simply outraged by the very idea that a member of Congress would decide to make a somewhat unconventional choice about how to spend the fixed pile of money each member is allotted to pay staff, because what the hell is even wrong with that lady and WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK! Here, just look at the socialist horror of people being paid enough to live on, from Sunday's \"Fox & Friends.\" If you can even bear to hear about the destruction of a once-great nation, that is.\nAs GQ's Luke Darby notes, it's almost as if Fox News \"knows that it's fighting on the side of wildly unpopular ideas.\" Host Griff Jenkins appears to be reduced to simply giving an accurate description of AOC's ideas, but \"in an outraged voice, so that the audience understands the aforementioned ideas and actions are, somehow, unreasonable.\" So obviously there has to be something un-American going on here:\nGet a load of this. A tweet went out yesterday -- she said \"Leadership begins at home\" or whatever, however she put it -- she basically announced that she is going to redistribute the money appropriated to her congressional office to make sure that entry-level staffers get a fair share of money.\nIs this even the USA anymore? Next you'll be seeing a dusky-hued president wearing a tan suit, or even worse. Fellow couch-sitter Pete Hegseth was astonished that anyone might cap the salary of the most important people in an office so that those at the lowest levels could receive a living wage.\nShe said everyone in my office will pay a living wage [...] Your entry-level intern is making 52 grand, while your chief of staff\u2015who has a very important role in a congressional office\u2015now is capped at 80, as opposed to the actual market rate on Capitol Hill which is closer to $150,000. So everyone's between 52 and 80. It's actually socialism and communism on display.\nHegseth is actually conflating a couple things there, by the way -- Ocasio-Cortez said in December that interns should be paid $15 an hour plus benefits, which would come out to only about $31K a year gross if they work the standard 2,087 hours a year -- and we suspect congressional interns might not? The $52K floor would be for full-time staffers, if anyone cares. But the real point is that if people at the very top aren't paid far more than those at the bottom, it's definitely communism, because words stopped meaning anything back in 2016 anyway.\nAlso, Pete, please wash your fucking hands, you disgusting pig. Or is basic hygiene socialism, too?\nOcasio-Cortez, as ever, seems more amused than anything at the pushback to paying a living wage.\nThe GOP is so disconnected from the basic idea that people should be paid enough to live that Fox actually thinks m\u2026 https://t.co/4nL1qaSvoT\n\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) 1551104504.0\nThat's because she hates America. She's even brainwashed her staff with her wild-eyed notion that folks at the top might agree to limits in order to help those lower down in the org chart, because socialism takes over your brain with un-American notions of \"fairness.\" Her comms director, Corbin Trent, said some pretty insane things to Roll Call, because the virus of egalitarianism has clearly wormed its way into the brains of all these monsters:\n\"We think that if a person is working, they should make enough to live\" [...]\nTrent acknowledged that some people would have to take pay cuts to work in the office. He said that was a trade-off that employees had been willing to make: \"I don't think you always put the burden on the bottom.\"\nThen the entire Ocasio-Cortez staff vowed their allegiance to Satan and promised they would come for your children, the end.\nAs proof that a \"living wage\" is nothing more than communism, we would add that when Yr Editrix hired Yr Dok Zoom as a full-time writer in 2014, she insisted on paying us enough to live on and buy health insurance (and once she could, took over the health insurance like a common POL POT). Maybe you're not shocked yet, but just look what the name of her little corporation is!\nThey aren't even trying to hide their true intent anymore, are they? REAL Americans like getting paid as little as possible so the CEO class can be adequately compensated, goddammit, and anyone who says otherwise is clearly a subversive.\nYr Wonkette is supported by reader donations. Please send us money so we can continue undermining American values, one living-wage paycheck for our writers at a time.\nAlso, since we're talking about work and fairness, remember to drop by Sunday for Yr Wonkette's Book Club -- we're reading Erik Loomis's excellent A History of America in Ten Strikes.

As your lawyer (we are not a lawyer), we advise you to secure any hurlable heavy objects near you before reading.</p>\n<p>Grieving moms who have dared to suggest that low vaccination rates are unhealthy for babies have been the on the receiving end of some very thoughtful scientific debating points from the anti-vaxxer mob.</p>\n<blockquote>When a child dies, members of the group sometimes encourage each other to go on that parent's Facebook page. The anti-vaxers then post messages telling the parents they're lying and their child never existed, or that the parent murdered them, or that vaccines killed the child, or some combination of all of those.<br><br>Nothing is considered too cruel. Just days after their children died, mothers say anti-vaxers on social media called them whores, the c-word and baby killers.</blockquote>\n<p>Consider the example of Jill Promoli, who lives near Toronto. Three years ago, her two-year-old, Jude McGee, died after being infected with flu. Promoli has since become an <a href=\"https://t.co/PRYUHjYbjf\">advocate for flu prevention</a> and getting flu shots. In return, she's heard from some very fine people who simply wanted to educate her:</p>\n<blockquote>Some anti-vaxers told her she'd murdered Jude and made up a story about the flu to cover up her crime. Others said vaccines had killed her son. Some called her the c-word.<br><br>The worst ones -- the ones that would sometimes make her cry -- were the posts that said she was advocating for flu shots so that other children would die from the shots and their parents would be miserable like she was.<br><br>&quot;The first time it made me feel really sick because I couldn't fathom how anybody could even come up with such a terrible claim,&quot; Promoli said. &quot;It caught me off guard in its cruelty. What kind of a person does this?&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, why <em>else </em>would she advocate for people to get flu shots? Clearly, she's the deranged one. The anti-vaxxers must figure these parents don't have enough grief, so why not give them more?</p>\n<p>And yet Promoli persists in advocating for people to vaccinate their kids like some sort of non-stopping science person, and recently encouraged Justin Trudeau to<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1065609458410246144\"> publicize his own annual flu shot.</a> He mentioned her campaign in his tweet, even:</p>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1065609458410246144\"><p>Got this last night. Get your flu shot - for your protection and to help protect the more vulnerable people around&hellip; https://t.co/c9fOVtaUgA</p> &mdash; Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/statuses/1065609458410246144\">1542896067.0</a></blockquote>\n<p>Needless to say, there were anti-vax idiots in the replies, but also a teacher who said they make a point of getting their flu shot in front of their grade school class &quot;so they know there's nothing to be afraid of&quot; and one Trudeau fan who complained, &quot;you didn't even have to take your shirt off?&quot;</p>\n<p>CNN made a point of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/19/health/anti-vax-harassment-eprise/index.html\">talking to</a> leaders of a couple of anti-vaccine groups, and you may be astonished to learn that they seemed remarkably unconcerned by the online behavior of some of their more extreme adherents. One, Larry Cook, founder of &quot;Stop Mandatory Vaccination,&quot; insisted that of course there'll be some bad apples, but his membership is very active online, and only a tiny fraction of them bother parents whose children have died. He said he definitely doesn't &quot;condone violent behavior or tone&quot; and that he &quot;encourage[s] decorum&quot; during discussion online, but added that anyone advocating for mandatory vaccination is, after all, a death merchant who shouldn't be surprised if people object to their death merchanting:</p>\n<blockquote>Anyone &quot;who deliberately engage[s] in the politics of advocating for compulsory vaccination where children may be further damaged through government vaccine mandates can expect push back and resistance, alongside knowledgable discussions about vaccine risk in social media commentary.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>Oh, yes, and we should probably note he's lying about children being damaged by vaccines. That's bullshit and fearmongering. He adds that his members get harassed and called names (like bullshitters and fearmongers), and he got a death threat too, so really, who's being violent?</p>\n<p>Del Bigtree, another leader of an anti-vax group, said he believes none of his supporters would harass a grieving parent, blaming &quot;infiltrators&quot; who were out to &quot;create incendiary situations.&quot; Bigtree's name came up in another context later in the article, too, in a Facebook message sent to Dr. Richard Pan, the California pediatrician who helped push the state in 2015 to <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/california-pries-measles-out-of-anti-vaxxers-cold-dumb-hands\">end all but medical exemptions</a> from the state's vaccination mandate:</p>\n<figure><img data-rm-shortcode-id=\"M88F5R1581012558\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xOTI4NTU0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU4MzE3MzAwMn0.999LmNERmRta48QKW_sfcXzoZz5B1Ujqd78ckFSCfPE/img.jpg?width=980\"></img></figure>\n<p>There's a video out there of Pan not wanting to talk to Bigtree, which proves science is fake and doctors are Nazi genociders of babies.</p>\n<p>In addition to several more parents who are still being harassed by anti-vaxxers years after their children died (but they asked for it because they advocate for vaccinations), CNN also talked to Erin Costello, who uses throwaway sockpuppet accounts to pose as an anti-vaxxer and join their private Facebook groups, where Costello has seen some very <em>knowledgable discussions about vaccine risk</em>as well as some strategizing for &quot;pushback&quot; against those awful grieving parents who advocate for vaccination. One member of Stop Mandatory Vaccination suggested others go visit a mom who'd posted about her baby having seizures after getting vaccinated (it's a very rare side when flu vaccine is given at the same time as two other vaccines, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/febrile-seizures.html\">according to the CDC</a> -- about 30 in 100,000 vaccinations). Hey, excellent chance to scare that mom into the anti-vax camp!</p>\n<blockquote>The anti-vaxer urged others in the group to &quot;comment for her to read! I want to win this mom over and she really trusts her pediatrician but at the same time she is scared!&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>As it happens, Costello also saw another member of the same group calling attention to one of the mothers CNN profiled, who had provoked the flying monkeys by calling on other parents to vaccinate:</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;Anyone want to chime in on this post?&quot; the anti-vaxer wrote.<br><br>Another member responded, &quot;I feel sorry for the lost baby and her other children but someone needs to inject her with vaccines until she dies.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>They seem nice!</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Facebook is doing its very best to address the harassment, which is to say it is doing pretty much nothing, because it believes in empowering its users:</p>\n<blockquote>A Facebook spokesperson responded to these concerns: <br><br>&quot;We try to empower our users with controls, such as blocking other users and moderating comments, so they can limit their exposure to unwanted, offensive or hurtful content. We also encourage people to report bullying behavior on our platform, so we can review the content and take proper action,&quot; the spokesperson wrote in an email.</blockquote>\n<p>Good luck, parents whose kids died! Remember, the mob &quot;cares about&quot; children too, so maybe you should be a bit more open-minded, huh? If your child even existed in the first place.</p>\n<p>Yr Wonkette is supported by reader donations.

                "text": "CNN is out today with a story on members of the anti-vaccination/pro-disease movement who have found a delightful new way to win converts to their side in the war on science: find parents (mothers, generally) who have recently lost a child to a preventable disease, and then harass them on social media, because after all, good people refuse vaccines and anyone who advocates for vaccines must be burned to the ground. As your lawyer (we are not a lawyer), we advise you to secure any hurlable heavy objects near you before reading.\nGrieving moms who have dared to suggest that low vaccination rates are unhealthy for babies have been the on the receiving end of some very thoughtful scientific debating points from the anti-vaxxer mob.\nWhen a child dies, members of the group sometimes encourage each other to go on that parent's Facebook page. The anti-vaxers then post messages telling the parents they're lying and their child never existed, or that the parent murdered them, or that vaccines killed the child, or some combination of all of those.\nNothing is considered too cruel. Just days after their children died, mothers say anti-vaxers on social media called them whores, the c-word and baby killers.\nConsider the example of Jill Promoli, who lives near Toronto. Three years ago, her two-year-old, Jude McGee, died after being infected with flu. Promoli has since become an advocate for flu prevention and getting flu shots. In return, she's heard from some very fine people who simply wanted to educate her:\nSome anti-vaxers told her she'd murdered Jude and made up a story about the flu to cover up her crime. Others said vaccines had killed her son. Some called her the c-word.\nThe worst ones -- the ones that would sometimes make her cry -- were the posts that said she was advocating for flu shots so that other children would die from the shots and their parents would be miserable like she was.\n\"The first time it made me feel really sick because I couldn't fathom how anybody could even come up with such a terrible claim,\" Promoli said. \"It caught me off guard in its cruelty. What kind of a person does this?\"\nOn the other hand, why else would she advocate for people to get flu shots? Clearly, she's the deranged one. The anti-vaxxers must figure these parents don't have enough grief, so why not give them more?\nAnd yet Promoli persists in advocating for people to vaccinate their kids like some sort of non-stopping science person, and recently encouraged Justin Trudeau to publicize his own annual flu shot. He mentioned her campaign in his tweet, even:\nGot this last night. Get your flu shot - for your protection and to help protect the more vulnerable people around\u2026 https://t.co/c9fOVtaUgA\n\u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) 1542896067.0\nNeedless to say, there were anti-vax idiots in the replies, but also a teacher who said they make a point of getting their flu shot in front of their grade school class \"so they know there's nothing to be afraid of\" and one Trudeau fan who complained, \"you didn't even have to take your shirt off?\"\nCNN made a point of talking to leaders of a couple of anti-vaccine groups, and you may be astonished to learn that they seemed remarkably unconcerned by the online behavior of some of their more extreme adherents. One, Larry Cook, founder of \"Stop Mandatory Vaccination,\" insisted that of course there'll be some bad apples, but his membership is very active online, and only a tiny fraction of them bother parents whose children have died. He said he definitely doesn't \"condone violent behavior or tone\" and that he \"encourage[s] decorum\" during discussion online, but added that anyone advocating for mandatory vaccination is, after all, a death merchant who shouldn't be surprised if people object to their death merchanting:\nAnyone \"who deliberately engage[s] in the politics of advocating for compulsory vaccination where children may be further damaged through government vaccine mandates can expect push back and resistance, alongside knowledgable discussions about vaccine risk in social media commentary.\"\nOh, yes, and we should probably note he's lying about children being damaged by vaccines. That's bullshit and fearmongering. He adds that his members get harassed and called names (like bullshitters and fearmongers), and he got a death threat too, so really, who's being violent?\nDel Bigtree, another leader of an anti-vax group, said he believes none of his supporters would harass a grieving parent, blaming \"infiltrators\" who were out to \"create incendiary situations.\" Bigtree's name came up in another context later in the article, too, in a Facebook message sent to Dr. Richard Pan, the California pediatrician who helped push the state in 2015 to end all but medical exemptions from the state's vaccination mandate:\nThere's a video out there of Pan not wanting to talk to Bigtree, which proves science is fake and doctors are Nazi genociders of babies.\nIn addition to several more parents who are still being harassed by anti-vaxxers years after their children died (but they asked for it because they advocate for vaccinations), CNN also talked to Erin Costello, who uses throwaway sockpuppet accounts to pose as an anti-vaxxer and join their private Facebook groups, where Costello has seen some very knowledgable discussions about vaccine riskas well as some strategizing for \"pushback\" against those awful grieving parents who advocate for vaccination. One member of Stop Mandatory Vaccination suggested others go visit a mom who'd posted about her baby having seizures after getting vaccinated (it's a very rare side when flu vaccine is given at the same time as two other vaccines, according to the CDC -- about 30 in 100,000 vaccinations). Hey, excellent chance to scare that mom into the anti-vax camp!\nThe anti-vaxer urged others in the group to \"comment for her to read! I want to win this mom over and she really trusts her pediatrician but at the same time she is scared!\"\nAs it happens, Costello also saw another member of the same group calling attention to one of the mothers CNN profiled, who had provoked the flying monkeys by calling on other parents to vaccinate:\n\"Anyone want to chime in on this post?\" the anti-vaxer wrote.\nAnother member responded, \"I feel sorry for the lost baby and her other children but someone needs to inject her with vaccines until she dies.\"\nThey seem nice!\nFortunately, Facebook is doing its very best to address the harassment, which is to say it is doing pretty much nothing, because it believes in empowering its users:\nA Facebook spokesperson responded to these concerns:\n\"We try to empower our users with controls, such as blocking other users and moderating comments, so they can limit their exposure to unwanted, offensive or hurtful content. We also encourage people to report bullying behavior on our platform, so we can review the content and take proper action,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email.\nGood luck, parents whose kids died! Remember, the mob \"cares about\" children too, so maybe you should be a bit more open-minded, huh? If your child even existed in the first place.\nYr Wonkette is supported by reader donations.

It must be sweeps week, since we've got the Trash Twins and Jeff Bezos's Wandering Dick back in the rotation.</p>\n<p>Back in February, <em><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/mistress-lauren-sanchezs-brother-leaked-bezos-racy-texts-to-enquirer-sources-say-7?mod=article_inline\">The Daily Beast</a></em> confirmed that Michael Sanchez was the <em>National Enquirer's</em> source for the <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/sanchez-pocketed-250k-for-his-sisters-sexts-but-he-did-it-for-love\">leaked texts</a> between Jeff Bezos and his sister Lauren Sanchez. You know, just in case anyone failed to work that out when Elkan Abramowitz, the lawyer for the magazine's parent company American Media (AMI), went on television and <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/leaking-naked-pics-of-your-own-sister-and-blaming-the-deep-state-such-a-baller-move\">announced</a> that the source was &quot;well known to both Mr. Bezos and Miss Sanchez.&quot; Now <em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-national-enquirer-got-bezos-texts-it-paid-200-000-to-his-lovers-brother-11552953981\">The Wall Street Journal </a></em>has gotten details of the contract, confirming that Sanchez did indeed sell a photo of his own sister's pink bits for $200,000. Stay classy, bro, we know you will!</p>\n<figure><img data-rm-shortcode-id=\"WIFIEW1580962608\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xOTI4NDM2Mi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU4MTA2MTYwOH0.B6qv3D6JkxI1KfsSkziHjZnumI9dRNXDoRPUKh5dC_M/img.png?width=980\"></img><figcaption>Michael Sanchez Twitter</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The deal was explicitly NOT a catch and kill, and Sanchez was free to keep the cash and re-sell the stolen texts and photos if the <em> Enquirer</em> failed to publish them in 30 days. Which is bloody convenient for him, since the magazine's regular practice was to pay sources only if and when the stories actually ran.</p>\n<blockquote> In light of the recently concluded government investigation, Mr. Stracher, the general counsel, inserted an unusual provision into the Oct. 26 contract with Mr. Sanchez to make it clear the deal wasn't a &quot;catch and kill,&quot; those people said.<br> <br> If American Media didn't publish anything within about a month's time, Mr. Sanchez could sell the information to another outlet and keep the money, they said. The provision stemmed from concern by American Media employees that Mr. Pecker would buy the story and suppress it because of his relationship with [talent agent Ari] Emanuel, whose partner is married to Ms. Sanchez, said some of those people. </blockquote>\n<p>Let's accept as fact for the moment that Pecker spent months <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/the-porn-star-the-playmate-the-president-and-his-pecker-just-look-at-this-passel-of-putzes\">negotiating</a> to buy up stories from Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels, and then backed out of the Daniels deal because his lawyers told him it might constitute an illegal campaign contribution, but was somehow out of the loop on negotiations to buy up the Bezos pictures. The magazine was planning a big special issue, but Pecker was too busy combing his pornstache to concern himself with the pesky details. And while he wasn't looking, his own employees, in mortal fear of federal prosecutors, cornered him into printing a story harmful to Donald Trump's enemies because they worried that <em>not printing it</em> would look like a political favor for ... Ari Emanuel.</p>\n<p>UH HUH.</p>\n<p>Well, the <em>Journal</em> has reliable sources, we guess. And those sources say that on November 7, Pecker invited his general counsel Cameron Stracher to lunch in a public place, where he screamed and cursed at him for concealing the upfront payment to Michael Sanchez, <em>of which he had no prior knowledge.</em></p>\n<blockquote> The Wall Street Journal couldn't determine whether anyone at American Media briefed Mr. Pecker on the contract's specifics before it completed the deal with Mr. Sanchez. People close to Mr. Pecker said he wasn't aware the payment was made upfront and felt as if was being forced to run the story.<br> <br> American Media paid Mr. Sanchez about a week after the lunch, said people familiar with the deal.</blockquote>\n<p>Look, far be it from this little recipe and mommyblog to impose linear time constraints on an august publication such as the Wall Street Journal, but in point of fact, the deal <em>was not</em> &quot;completed&quot; before the lunch, and Pecker could presumably have refused to go through with it if he didn't like the terms. But he <em>did</em> go through with it, and then the magazine sat on the story for exactly as long as it took to get their <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/7d75f13c35724c2bba7ec050c32d12f7\">massive debt </a>refinanced by venture capital firm Chatham Asset Management.</p>\n<p>That $400 million deal went through on January 3, and on January 7, Bezos and Lauren Sanchez got notes from AMI's chief content officer Dylan Howard, aka Pecker's Little Viper, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/was-tabloid-expose-of-bezos-affair-just-juicy-gossip-or-a-political-hit-job/2019/02/05/03d2f716-2633-11e9-90cd-dedb0c92dc17_story.html?utm_term=.8a926aec180f\">reading</a>, &quot;I write to request an interview with you about your love affair.&quot; Two days later, Bezos tweeted out that he and his wife McKenzie were separating, which <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/was-tabloid-expose-of-bezos-affair-just-juicy-gossip-or-a-political-hit-job/2019/02/05/03d2f716-2633-11e9-90cd-dedb0c92dc17_story.html?utm_term=.fc722353880f\">&quot;enraged&quot;</a> Howard by ruining his beautiful scoop. At which point the money guys at Chatham became, if not enraged, extremely uncomfortable that the idiots they'd just handed $400 million to were picking a fight with the one guy in the world whose pockets were deep enough to sustain a protracted legal battle. The WSJ reports:</p>\n<blockquote> Amid reports on alleged links between the Enquirer story and Mr. Pecker's actions on behalf of Mr. Trump during the 2016 election, American Media's financial backers at Chatham Asset Management&mdash;who had been unhappy about the Bezos coverage&mdash;conveyed their displeasure and pressured Mr. Pecker to resolve the matter, said people familiar with the communications. Mr. Pecker pressured his staff to do the same. </blockquote>\n<p>Which may or may not account for the <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/grab-a-big-peener-toilet-for-jeff-bezos-because-turns-out-that-thing-is-holyshithuge\">arguably extortionat</a>e letter Howard sent to Bezos on January 13, offering not to publish the pictures of Bezos's<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f\"> &quot;semi-erect manhood&quot;</a> if Bezos would call off his investigation of AMI's links to Saudi Arabia and announce that the publication of his stolen texts was &quot;not political.&quot; Except instead of folding, Bezos called their bluff, and the rest is history.</p>\n<p>You already know what happened next, so instead of going back over that all again, let's just make a few observations. If we were, say, David Pecker, we would be <em>absolutely delighted</em> with this Journal article. Because if Pecker had nothing to do with the Sanchez negotiations, then he can't be accused of having published Bezos's texts as a gift to Donald Trump. And it can't have been a favor to the Saudis, who were furious at Bezos for &quot;allowing&quot; the Washington Post to write all those mean stories about Jamal Khashoggi getting bonesawed to death, because Pecker had <em>nothing to do with it.</em> And while we're on the subject, hey Mister Venture Capitalist, it was those pesky underlings who made poor David Pecker publish that story embroiling the magazine in yet another controversy. And the prosecutors at SDNY should know that David Pecker would <em>never</em> do anything to jeopardize his plea agreement, under which he promised not to use the magazine for political dirty work. It was all the fault of that dastardly lawyer Cameron Stracher, who coincidentally quitfired himself at lunch and had his key card deactivated before he could get back to the office to clean out his desk. So if he tells a different story, well, he's just a disgruntled former employee with an axe to grind. Anyway, the important thing here is that nobody should be mad at David Pecker because he pocketed $400 million and steered the magazine into a legal and political hellhole from which they'll never escape. Because he was totally out of the loop at his own magazine, 'kay?</p>\n<p>MIGHTY FUCKIN' CONVENIENT, AIN'T IT?</p>\n<p><em>Follow your <a href=\"https://twitter.com/5DollarFeminist\">FDF</a> on Twitter!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Please click here to support your Wonkette, who keeps up with these garbage people just in case they're the next Stormy Daniels.

                "text": "Okay, Wonkers, grab those bonbons and settle in for your stories. It must be sweeps week, since we've got the Trash Twins and Jeff Bezos's Wandering Dick back in the rotation.\nBack in February, The Daily Beast confirmed that Michael Sanchez was the National Enquirer's source for the leaked texts between Jeff Bezos and his sister Lauren Sanchez. You know, just in case anyone failed to work that out when Elkan Abramowitz, the lawyer for the magazine's parent company American Media (AMI), went on television and announced that the source was \"well known to both Mr. Bezos and Miss Sanchez.\" Now The Wall Street Journal has gotten details of the contract, confirming that Sanchez did indeed sell a photo of his own sister's pink bits for $200,000. Stay classy, bro, we know you will!\nThe deal was explicitly NOT a catch and kill, and Sanchez was free to keep the cash and re-sell the stolen texts and photos if the Enquirer failed to publish them in 30 days. Which is bloody convenient for him, since the magazine's regular practice was to pay sources only if and when the stories actually ran.\nIn light of the recently concluded government investigation, Mr. Stracher, the general counsel, inserted an unusual provision into the Oct. 26 contract with Mr. Sanchez to make it clear the deal wasn't a \"catch and kill,\" those people said.\nIf American Media didn't publish anything within about a month's time, Mr. Sanchez could sell the information to another outlet and keep the money, they said. The provision stemmed from concern by American Media employees that Mr. Pecker would buy the story and suppress it because of his relationship with [talent agent Ari] Emanuel, whose partner is married to Ms. Sanchez, said some of those people.\nLet's accept as fact for the moment that Pecker spent months negotiating to buy up stories from Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels, and then backed out of the Daniels deal because his lawyers told him it might constitute an illegal campaign contribution, but was somehow out of the loop on negotiations to buy up the Bezos pictures. The magazine was planning a big special issue, but Pecker was too busy combing his pornstache to concern himself with the pesky details. And while he wasn't looking, his own employees, in mortal fear of federal prosecutors, cornered him into printing a story harmful to Donald Trump's enemies because they worried that not printing it would look like a political favor for ... Ari Emanuel.\nUH HUH.\nWell, the Journal has reliable sources, we guess. And those sources say that on November 7, Pecker invited his general counsel Cameron Stracher to lunch in a public place, where he screamed and cursed at him for concealing the upfront payment to Michael Sanchez, of which he had no prior knowledge.\nThe Wall Street Journal couldn't determine whether anyone at American Media briefed Mr. Pecker on the contract's specifics before it completed the deal with Mr. Sanchez. People close to Mr. Pecker said he wasn't aware the payment was made upfront and felt as if was being forced to run the story.\nAmerican Media paid Mr. Sanchez about a week after the lunch, said people familiar with the deal.\nLook, far be it from this little recipe and mommyblog to impose linear time constraints on an august publication such as the Wall Street Journal, but in point of fact, the deal was not \"completed\" before the lunch, and Pecker could presumably have refused to go through with it if he didn't like the terms. But he did go through with it, and then the magazine sat on the story for exactly as long as it took to get their massive debt refinanced by venture capital firm Chatham Asset Management.\nThat $400 million deal went through on January 3, and on January 7, Bezos and Lauren Sanchez got notes from AMI's chief content officer Dylan Howard, aka Pecker's Little Viper, reading, \"I write to request an interview with you about your love affair.\" Two days later, Bezos tweeted out that he and his wife McKenzie were separating, which \"enraged\" Howard by ruining his beautiful scoop. At which point the money guys at Chatham became, if not enraged, extremely uncomfortable that the idiots they'd just handed $400 million to were picking a fight with the one guy in the world whose pockets were deep enough to sustain a protracted legal battle. The WSJ reports:\nAmid reports on alleged links between the Enquirer story and Mr. Pecker's actions on behalf of Mr. Trump during the 2016 election, American Media's financial backers at Chatham Asset Management\u2014who had been unhappy about the Bezos coverage\u2014conveyed their displeasure and pressured Mr. Pecker to resolve the matter, said people familiar with the communications. Mr. Pecker pressured his staff to do the same.\nWhich may or may not account for the arguably extortionate letter Howard sent to Bezos on January 13, offering not to publish the pictures of Bezos's \"semi-erect manhood\" if Bezos would call off his investigation of AMI's links to Saudi Arabia and announce that the publication of his stolen texts was \"not political.\" Except instead of folding, Bezos called their bluff, and the rest is history.\nYou already know what happened next, so instead of going back over that all again, let's just make a few observations. If we were, say, David Pecker, we would be absolutely delighted with this Journal article. Because if Pecker had nothing to do with the Sanchez negotiations, then he can't be accused of having published Bezos's texts as a gift to Donald Trump. And it can't have been a favor to the Saudis, who were furious at Bezos for \"allowing\" the Washington Post to write all those mean stories about Jamal Khashoggi getting bonesawed to death, because Pecker had nothing to do with it. And while we're on the subject, hey Mister Venture Capitalist, it was those pesky underlings who made poor David Pecker publish that story embroiling the magazine in yet another controversy. And the prosecutors at SDNY should know that David Pecker would never do anything to jeopardize his plea agreement, under which he promised not to use the magazine for political dirty work. It was all the fault of that dastardly lawyer Cameron Stracher, who coincidentally quitfired himself at lunch and had his key card deactivated before he could get back to the office to clean out his desk. So if he tells a different story, well, he's just a disgruntled former employee with an axe to grind. Anyway, the important thing here is that nobody should be mad at David Pecker because he pocketed $400 million and steered the magazine into a legal and political hellhole from which they'll never escape. Because he was totally out of the loop at his own magazine, 'kay?\nMIGHTY FUCKIN' CONVENIENT, AIN'T IT?\nFollow your FDF on Twitter!\nPlease click here to support your Wonkette, who keeps up with these garbage people just in case they're the next Stormy Daniels.

                "html": "<p>We know a few things about Donald Trump's richness, or lack of it. We know he's been shall we say <em>reticent</em> about releasing his tax returns for several years running, and many suspect it's partially because they show that he isn't as rich as he says he is. We know Michael Cohen <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/holy-jesus-shit-your-michael-cohen-liveblog\">testified to Congress</a> that Trump would rig up his financial statements, either to inflate his assets -- like when he was trying to buy something big like the Buffalo Bills or get financing for big projects, to make it look like he could afford it, AKA bank fraud -- or deflate them, like if he was trying to commit insurance fraud. ALLEGEDLY.</p>\n<p>Rachel Maddow had a <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-alleged-financial-fraud-creates-important-new-vulnerability\">fascinating and hilarious report</a> a couple weeks ago about a particular asset on those financial disclosure forms, Trump's Seven Springs estate in Bedford, New York, which he bought for $7.5 million in 1995, but suddenly in 2012 Trump decided for the purposes of a financial disclosure that it was worth $291 MILLION DOLLARS IN AMERICAN CURRENCY. The next year, the tax assessor put it at $18.9 million. (Trump is apparently bad at hiding these things in plain sight.)</p>\n<p>Whenever the subject of Trump's weird money comes up, the discussion inevitably leads to Deutsche Bank, which has its own massive problems (<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/11/29/671820502/deutsche-bank-offices-are-raided-in-money-laundering-probe\">Russian money laundering,</a> anyone?), and which kept giving Trump money, long after every other American bank decided Trump was dead to them -- even after Trump <em>personally screwed Deutsche Bank</em>. And the question has always been OMG LOL WTF WHYYYYYYYYY?</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, another thing we know about Trump's relationship with Deutsche Bank? One of the times <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-wanted-mueller-fired-deutsche-bank-subpoena-2018-4\">he tried</a> to have special counsel Robert Mueller fired, it was because <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/robert-mueller-following-the-dirty-russian-money-all-the-way-up-donald-trumps-ass\">there were news reports</a> that Mueller was requesting records pertaining to Trump's relationship with Deutsche Bank. So that is interesting and strange and kind of screams &quot;THERE ARE CRIMES HERE, LOOK HERE FOR THE CRIMES.&quot;</p>\n<p>David Enrich at the <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/business/trump-deutsche-bank.html\">published a gigantic thing</a> yesterday that tells us one important thing, which is that it seems Deutsche Bank totally knew Trump was screwing them <em>in real time</em>, that they knew multiple times he was lying about his assets, and they ... just kept working with him anyway! Like you do!</p>\n<p>It's impossible to encapsulate this whole thing, because it is one million words long and you should read the whole thing, but here is a brief list of things we learned from the article:</p>\n<ul><li>One of Trump's earliest loans from Deutsche Bank, for a casino in Atlantic City, seemed pretty normal until it was discovered that the &quot;signature of the credit officer who had approved the Trump Marina deal had been forged,&quot; SO THAT'S WEIRD. That's when Trump was working with a guy there named Mike Offit, who is the son of a writer named Sidney Offit.</li><li>Later on, as the bank's relationship with Trump grew, the commercial real estate division featured a man named Justin Kennedy, who is the son of this one judge named Anthony Kennedy. You might have heard of that guy.</li><li>One time in the early 2000-sies, a group from Deutsche Bank had the hard job of selling bonds on Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts, but WOMP WOMP, nobody wanted to buy that shit. So Trump promised them all Mar-a-Lago vacations if they got those bonds sold, and they did, and then Trump almost reneged on his promise to take them to Mar-a-Lago. But he took them, and they had a very good time, and in 2004, Trump defaulted on his loan. WOMP WOMP again. That was the last time (that particular arm of) Deutsche Bank was gonna do business with Trump ever again!</li><li>When Trump was trying to get financing for a Trump hotel in Chicago in 2005, &quot;Mr. Trump told Deutsche Bank his net worth was about $3 billion, but when bank employees reviewed his finances, they concluded he was worth about $788 million, according to documents produced during a lawsuit Mr. Trump brought against the former New York Times journalist Timothy O'Brien.&quot; TOTALLY NORMAL. And one of the high-up executives in the commercial real estate division at Deutsche Bank said <em>in an interview</em> that &quot;he and others cautioned that Mr. Trump should be avoided because he had worked with people in the construction industry connected to organized crime.&quot; TOTALLY NORMAL AGAIN! But, you know, they gave him money anyway. And in 2008, Trump defaulted, blamed it on the financial crisis, but claimed that should be OK, because the financial crisis was &quot;an act of God.&quot; So <em>he</em> sued <em>Deutsche Bank</em> for billions in &quot;damages.&quot; EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS TOO NORMAL. Anyway, after that, (that particular division of) Deutsche Bank decided they definitely were not gonna work with <em>that </em>guy again!</li><li>They moved him over to the private banking division, where Jared hooked Trump up with a private banker lady named Rosemary Vrablic, which was great because Trump wanted to buy Doral in Florida, and he needed $100 million (he even said please!). Unfortunately, in his financial statements to the bank, he &quot;overvalu[ed] some of his real estate assets by as much as 70 percent.&quot; WOMP WOMP, no loan for you, just kidding, here is a loan for you! &quot;Aside from his history of defaults, he was an attractive borrower.&quot; Just like how aside from how Trump is a <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/trump-russia-afghanistan\">Russian intelligence asset,</a> a white supremacist, and a total fucking failure, his presidency has been pretty normal!</li><li>So then he asked for another loan on the Chicago project, and said don't worry, he'll use some of <em>that</em> loan to pay off what he owes to that <em>other </em>division of the bank, because a really good way to deal with banks is to ask them for a loan to pay debt that is owed to <em>themselves</em>. Surely Deutsche Bank wouldn't ... just kidding, HAVE SOME MONEY, MISTER TRUMP!</li></ul>\n<p>That is just some shit! And we haven't even gotten to the whole Buffalo Bills shit. Shall we?</p>\n<blockquote>In early 2014, Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, approached Ms. Vrablic about more potential loans.<br><br>The owner of the Buffalo Bills had died, and the N.F.L. franchise was up for sale. Mr. Trump was interested, and he needed to show the league he had the financial wherewithal to pull off a transaction that could top $1 billion.<br><br>Mr. Trump asked Ms. Vrablic if the bank would be willing to make a loan and handed over bare-bones financial statements that estimated his net worth at $8.7 billion.<br><br>Mr. Cohen testified to Congress last month that the documents exaggerated Mr. Trump's wealth. Deutsche Bank executives had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/business/donald-trump-buffalo-bills-deutsche-bank.html?module=inline\">reached a similar conclusion</a>. They nonetheless agreed to vouch for Mr. Trump's bid, according to an executive involved.</blockquote>\n<p>WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY? Like, we get that Deutsche Bank has really been into risk over these past couple of decades, but WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY? At this point, it's like &quot;Hey Deutsche Bank, why are you hitting yourself?&quot;</p>\n<p>According to David Enrich's sources, after the 2016 election, the question of Trump's relationship with Deutsche Bank became so toxic that they told their Wall Street employees to not even say his name (literally), because they didn't want their gross relationship with him to get any more attention than it already was. But oh well, best laid plans!</p>\n<p>Deutsche Bank has reportedly been <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/03/03/maxine_waters_deutsche_bank_is_cooperating_with_house_dems_to_investigate_trump_money_laundering.html\">cooperating</a> with Maxine Waters's House Financial Services Committee, and with the New York attorney general's investigation, so that's good. And as for Rosemary Vrablic, she says she's just waitin' on her subpoena to come testify to Congress.</p>\n<p>So are we, Ms. Vrablic.

                "text": "We know a few things about Donald Trump's richness, or lack of it. We know he's been shall we say reticent about releasing his tax returns for several years running, and many suspect it's partially because they show that he isn't as rich as he says he is. We know Michael Cohen testified to Congress that Trump would rig up his financial statements, either to inflate his assets -- like when he was trying to buy something big like the Buffalo Bills or get financing for big projects, to make it look like he could afford it, AKA bank fraud -- or deflate them, like if he was trying to commit insurance fraud. ALLEGEDLY.\nRachel Maddow had a fascinating and hilarious report a couple weeks ago about a particular asset on those financial disclosure forms, Trump's Seven Springs estate in Bedford, New York, which he bought for $7.5 million in 1995, but suddenly in 2012 Trump decided for the purposes of a financial disclosure that it was worth $291 MILLION DOLLARS IN AMERICAN CURRENCY. The next year, the tax assessor put it at $18.9 million. (Trump is apparently bad at hiding these things in plain sight.)\nWhenever the subject of Trump's weird money comes up, the discussion inevitably leads to Deutsche Bank, which has its own massive problems (Russian money laundering, anyone?), and which kept giving Trump money, long after every other American bank decided Trump was dead to them -- even after Trump personally screwed Deutsche Bank. And the question has always been OMG LOL WTF WHYYYYYYYYY?\nOh yeah, another thing we know about Trump's relationship with Deutsche Bank? One of the times he tried to have special counsel Robert Mueller fired, it was because there were news reports that Mueller was requesting records pertaining to Trump's relationship with Deutsche Bank. So that is interesting and strange and kind of screams \"THERE ARE CRIMES HERE, LOOK HERE FOR THE CRIMES.\"\nDavid Enrich at the New York Times published a gigantic thing yesterday that tells us one important thing, which is that it seems Deutsche Bank totally knew Trump was screwing them in real time, that they knew multiple times he was lying about his assets, and they ... just kept working with him anyway! Like you do!\nIt's impossible to encapsulate this whole thing, because it is one million words long and you should read the whole thing, but here is a brief list of things we learned from the article:\nOne of Trump's earliest loans from Deutsche Bank, for a casino in Atlantic City, seemed pretty normal until it was discovered that the \"signature of the credit officer who had approved the Trump Marina deal had been forged,\" SO THAT'S WEIRD. That's when Trump was working with a guy there named Mike Offit, who is the son of a writer named Sidney Offit.\nLater on, as the bank's relationship with Trump grew, the commercial real estate division featured a man named Justin Kennedy, who is the son of this one judge named Anthony Kennedy. You might have heard of that guy.\nOne time in the early 2000-sies, a group from Deutsche Bank had the hard job of selling bonds on Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, but WOMP WOMP, nobody wanted to buy that shit. So Trump promised them all Mar-a-Lago vacations if they got those bonds sold, and they did, and then Trump almost reneged on his promise to take them to Mar-a-Lago. But he took them, and they had a very good time, and in 2004, Trump defaulted on his loan. WOMP WOMP again. That was the last time (that particular arm of) Deutsche Bank was gonna do business with Trump ever again!\nWhen Trump was trying to get financing for a Trump hotel in Chicago in 2005, \"Mr. Trump told Deutsche Bank his net worth was about $3 billion, but when bank employees reviewed his finances, they concluded he was worth about $788 million, according to documents produced during a lawsuit Mr. Trump brought against the former New York Times journalist Timothy O'Brien.\" TOTALLY NORMAL. And one of the high-up executives in the commercial real estate division at Deutsche Bank said in an interview that \"he and others cautioned that Mr. Trump should be avoided because he had worked with people in the construction industry connected to organized crime.\" TOTALLY NORMAL AGAIN! But, you know, they gave him money anyway. And in 2008, Trump defaulted, blamed it on the financial crisis, but claimed that should be OK, because the financial crisis was \"an act of God.\" So he sued Deutsche Bank for billions in \"damages.\" EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS TOO NORMAL. Anyway, after that, (that particular division of) Deutsche Bank decided they definitely were not gonna work with that guy again!\nThey moved him over to the private banking division, where Jared hooked Trump up with a private banker lady named Rosemary Vrablic, which was great because Trump wanted to buy Doral in Florida, and he needed $100 million (he even said please!). Unfortunately, in his financial statements to the bank, he \"overvalu[ed] some of his real estate assets by as much as 70 percent.\" WOMP WOMP, no loan for you, just kidding, here is a loan for you! \"Aside from his history of defaults, he was an attractive borrower.\" Just like how aside from how Trump is a Russian intelligence asset, a white supremacist, and a total fucking failure, his presidency has been pretty normal!\nSo then he asked for another loan on the Chicago project, and said don't worry, he'll use some of that loan to pay off what he owes to that other division of the bank, because a really good way to deal with banks is to ask them for a loan to pay debt that is owed to themselves. Surely Deutsche Bank wouldn't ... just kidding, HAVE SOME MONEY, MISTER TRUMP!\nThat is just some shit! And we haven't even gotten to the whole Buffalo Bills shit. Shall we?\nIn early 2014, Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, approached Ms. Vrablic about more potential loans.\nThe owner of the Buffalo Bills had died, and the N.F.L. franchise was up for sale. Mr. Trump was interested, and he needed to show the league he had the financial wherewithal to pull off a transaction that could top $1 billion.\nMr. Trump asked Ms. Vrablic if the bank would be willing to make a loan and handed over bare-bones financial statements that estimated his net worth at $8.7 billion.\nMr. Cohen testified to Congress last month that the documents exaggerated Mr. Trump's wealth. Deutsche Bank executives had reached a similar conclusion. They nonetheless agreed to vouch for Mr. Trump's bid, according to an executive involved.\nWHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY? Like, we get that Deutsche Bank has really been into risk over these past couple of decades, but WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY? At this point, it's like \"Hey Deutsche Bank, why are you hitting yourself?\"\nAccording to David Enrich's sources, after the 2016 election, the question of Trump's relationship with Deutsche Bank became so toxic that they told their Wall Street employees to not even say his name (literally), because they didn't want their gross relationship with him to get any more attention than it already was. But oh well, best laid plans!\nDeutsche Bank has reportedly been cooperating with Maxine Waters's House Financial Services Committee, and with the New York attorney general's investigation, so that's good. And as for Rosemary Vrablic, she says she's just waitin' on her subpoena to come testify to Congress.\nSo are we, Ms. Vrablic.

Despite official announcements that the fire appears to be related to renovation work, Gateway Pundit suggested<a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/04/developing-french-media-confirms-there-were-no-construction-workers-at-notre-dame-cathedral-at-time-of-fire/\"> something more sinister: </a>&quot;French Media Confirms There Were NO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS at Notre Dame Cathedral at Time of Fire&quot; (based on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sotiridi/status/1117883209222508544\">one tweet</a> paraphrasing a news report). Hoft and his culture war battalion insisted, in two separate stories, that <a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/04/muslims-laughing-in-threads-on-notre-dame-fire-allah-est-grand/\">all Muslims everywhere</a> were dancing on rooftops <a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/04/blow-to-the-hearts-of-crusader-leaders-isis-supporters-cheer-as-fire-rips-through-notre-dame-cathedral-in-paris/\">celebrating the fire,</a> even if they didn't set it (but do you know for sure they <em>didn't?</em>).

Describing her in the lede as a &quot;prominent Muslim,&quot; Taylor pointed out, in case the hed hadn't done the job, that Omar's tweet</p>\n<blockquote>failed to use the name of the cathedral or even mention that it is a church&ndash;or a Catholic church. Notre Dame is French for Our Lady and is a <a href=\"https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=4967\">Catholic name</a> for the Virgin Mary, Mother of God who gave birth to Jesus.</blockquote>\n<p>Because presumably Gateway Pundit readers need to have obscure French terms like &quot;Notre Dame&quot; explained to them so they don't think a football team caught on fire. Also, saying that art and architecture are significant, and that they transcend time and location, is actually a deliberate insult to Christians, you see. Omar was actually &quot;denigrating Notre Dame as an art museum.&quot; That monster. To clarify why the Muslim lady is completely wrong, Taylor capped his argument with this indisputable truth!</p>\n<p>And yes, the replies to Omar's tweet are now full of angry &quot;Christians&quot; who are very GRRR, and why is a Muslim lady even &quot;praying&quot; to her fake Mulim &quot;god&quot; who is not at all the real god? Is she trying to <em>curse </em>the firefighters?</p>\n<p>So yes, it is an extreme offense to fail to point out that the cathedral is named for Holy Mary, Mother of God. And talking about Notre Dame as an architectural wonder is also very insulting. So let's see how a REAL Christian, Donald J. Trump, discussed the fire:</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P4A-U5Z44x8?rel=0\"></iframe></figure>\n<blockquote>I will tell you, the fire that they are having at the Notre Dame cathedral is something like few people have witnessed. It is one of the great treasures of the world. The greatest artists in the world. Probably, if you think about it, I would say it might be greater than almost any museum in the world and it's burning very badly. Looks like it's burning to the ground.</blockquote>\n<p>Hold on ... did the Great Man just denigrate a CATHOLIC CHURCH by comparing it to a museum? Doesn't he know it was named after the VIRGIN MARY WHO GAVE BIRTH TO JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOR?</p>\n<p>Trump then went on to suggest, like some kind of heathen Muslim lady, that the place had mere &quot;cultural&quot; significance, completely ignoring the fact that the cathedral holds the ACTUAL CROWN OF THORNS WORN BY JESUS. (The relic survived the fire, and no, Hoft's <a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/04/jesus-crown-of-thorns-rescued-from-inferno-at-notre-dame-cathedral/\">Gateway Pundit story</a> does not say the relic is &quot;believed&quot; to be authentic by some people. It IS REAL). Anyway, look at the denigrating!</p>\n<blockquote>That is beyond countries, that is beyond anything. That is a part of our growing up. It's a part of our culture. It's a part of our lives. That's a truly great cathedral. I have been there, I have seen it. It's a terrible scene. <br><br>They think it was caused by, at this moment they don't know, but they think it was caused by renovation. I hope that's the reason. Renovation, what's that all about? It's a terrible sight to behold.</blockquote>\n<p>How true this is. Renovation, what is that?</p>\n<p>Oh, never mind, he said &quot;Cathedral&quot; and &quot;Notre Dame,&quot; so he clearly had his mind on the building's religious significance, the end.</p>\n<p>Yr Wonkette is supported by reader donations.

                "text": "It shouldn't be at all surprising that when US Rep. Ilhan Omar tweeted her sympathies for the people of Paris (and her prayers for the firefighters), the Stupidest Man On The Internet and his compatriots at Gateway Pundit decided that was incredibly offensive because her tweet simply wasn't Jesusy enough.\nThe Omar story came on top of a whole raft of stories aimed at whipping up political outrage over what appears to have been an accidental fire, because why waste a good tragedy? Despite official announcements that the fire appears to be related to renovation work, Gateway Pundit suggested something more sinister: \"French Media Confirms There Were NO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS at Notre Dame Cathedral at Time of Fire\" (based on one tweet paraphrasing a news report). Hoft and his culture war battalion insisted, in two separate stories, that all Muslims everywhere were dancing on rooftops celebrating the fire, even if they didn't set it (but do you know for sure they didn't?). Fox's Shep Smith was scolded for cutting off a French municipal official who hinted the REAL cause of the fire would be covered up by \"politically correct\" officialdom, and just to be sure readers knew Muslims are bad, the site reminded them of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, too. Hoft's internet outlet also offered some uplifting stories about Parisians -- no, \"Catholics with rosaries\"! -- singing hymns as the cathedral burned, and proclaimed the survival of some parts of the interior a genuine miracle.\nBut then there was this horrible tweet by Ilhan Omar, a slap in the face to all Christendom:\nArt and architecture have a unique ability to help us connect across our differences and bring people together in i\u2026 https://t.co/GMsbIdDN6T\n\u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) 1555366640.0\nShocking! Horrifying! CLICKBAITY! The site tried to cram every single outrage into a single headline:\nThey almost didn't need to run anything else, but longtime Stupidest Guest Blogger on the Internet Kristinn Taylor did his damnedest to explain why Ilhan Omar had personally murdered everyone in Paris with her malicious good wishes. Describing her in the lede as a \"prominent Muslim,\" Taylor pointed out, in case the hed hadn't done the job, that Omar's tweet\nfailed to use the name of the cathedral or even mention that it is a church\u2013or a Catholic church. Notre Dame is French for Our Lady and is a Catholic name for the Virgin Mary, Mother of God who gave birth to Jesus.\nBecause presumably Gateway Pundit readers need to have obscure French terms like \"Notre Dame\" explained to them so they don't think a football team caught on fire. Also, saying that art and architecture are significant, and that they transcend time and location, is actually a deliberate insult to Christians, you see. Omar was actually \"denigrating Notre Dame as an art museum.\" That monster. To clarify why the Muslim lady is completely wrong, Taylor capped his argument with this indisputable truth!\nAnd yes, the replies to Omar's tweet are now full of angry \"Christians\" who are very GRRR, and why is a Muslim lady even \"praying\" to her fake Mulim \"god\" who is not at all the real god? Is she trying to curse the firefighters?\nSo yes, it is an extreme offense to fail to point out that the cathedral is named for Holy Mary, Mother of God. And talking about Notre Dame as an architectural wonder is also very insulting. So let's see how a REAL Christian, Donald J. Trump, discussed the fire:\nI will tell you, the fire that they are having at the Notre Dame cathedral is something like few people have witnessed. It is one of the great treasures of the world. The greatest artists in the world. Probably, if you think about it, I would say it might be greater than almost any museum in the world and it's burning very badly. Looks like it's burning to the ground.\nHold on ... did the Great Man just denigrate a CATHOLIC CHURCH by comparing it to a museum? Doesn't he know it was named after the VIRGIN MARY WHO GAVE BIRTH TO JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOR?\nTrump then went on to suggest, like some kind of heathen Muslim lady, that the place had mere \"cultural\" significance, completely ignoring the fact that the cathedral holds the ACTUAL CROWN OF THORNS WORN BY JESUS. (The relic survived the fire, and no, Hoft's Gateway Pundit story does not say the relic is \"believed\" to be authentic by some people. It IS REAL). Anyway, look at the denigrating!\nThat is beyond countries, that is beyond anything. That is a part of our growing up. It's a part of our culture. It's a part of our lives. That's a truly great cathedral. I have been there, I have seen it. It's a terrible scene.\nThey think it was caused by, at this moment they don't know, but they think it was caused by renovation. I hope that's the reason. Renovation, what's that all about? It's a terrible sight to behold.\nHow true this is. Renovation, what is that?\nOh, never mind, he said \"Cathedral\" and \"Notre Dame,\" so he clearly had his mind on the building's religious significance, the end.\nYr Wonkette is supported by reader donations.

We've mostly been ignoring Wohl since the youngster's <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/jacob-wohls-imaginary-robert-mueller-accusing-wealth-lady-will-not-be-joining-us-today\">great #FailWeek 2018</a>, when he invented an &quot;intelligence&quot; company (phone number for company: Jacob Wohl's mom's phone) so he could invent a story about Robert Mueller raping somebody, only to have his story fall apart repeatedly <em>while he was telling it. </em></p>\n<p>It's not that li'l Jacob hasn't been busy or anything.

Ilhan Omar with <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/laura-loomer-is-just-a-deeply-sad-human-being\">world's most embarrassing human person</a> Laura Loomer, and, um ... yeah, we don't know why, and from reading his batshit Twitter feed, it sounds like they got assassinated in one of Minneapolis's non-existent &quot;no-go&quot; zones, but don't worry, they got better.</p>\n<p>Behold their posse:</p>\n<figure><img data-rm-shortcode-id=\"WDW0QJ1581012485\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xOTIzMTI1MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU4NTQyMzIzMn0.y_oFZU7bUqSDxerRWzT5i4_Fg-xpyoQUhqnytLk-xi0/img.jpg?width=980\"></img></figure>\n<p>OH WAIT YOU CAN'T because while we were writing this he got suspended from Twitter!

Read on, and you will see!)a</p>\n<p>And don't think Jacob Wohl stays home lonely in the evening, because he went to CIGAR NIGHT with Mike Cernovich and that douchewanker who tweeted that list of how ladies can be more fuckable.</p>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1100478178223521793\"><p>Two people who attended our last cigar night (no new invites for the next one) are in the media today. https://t.co/TfQJwWSJI8</p> &mdash; Mike Cernovich | \ud83d\udcfd (@Cernovich) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cernovich/statuses/1100478178223521793\">1551209418.0</a></blockquote>\n<p>No clarifications on exactly where they put the cigars, but sure, fine, all humans deserve good clean friendship.</p>\n<p>ANYWAY, this newspaper profile! You can read all of it if you wanna, or you can just stick with Wonkette's very brief recap, which will tell you all the important stuff you never needed to know:</p>\n<h2>Jacob Wohl Is Ugly And He Mooches Off The Free Iced Water At The Hipster Coffee Shops<br> </h2>\n<p>Oh, but that's not all. Behold, a glorious paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote>He arrived at the Orange County cafe in a black Corvette with new-car paper license plates and extended a rigid hand but did not shake when a reporter grasped it. Sipping a free cup of ice water, the thin, severe-featured Wohl, who speaks in clipped verbiage, quickly worked into conversation that he was carrying a concealed firearm in response to the &quot;voluminous left-wing threats&quot; he has received.</blockquote>\n<p>How much #Loser can you cram into one graf? Damn! He's spending his publicity money like an idiot on BPS cars (Big Penis Substitute, not to be confused with BPTs, which are Matthew Whitaker's <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/justice-department-says-its-cool-for-meatball-mcdumb-to-be-acting-attorney-general-so-all-yall-can-stfu\">Big Peener Toilets</a>); his handshake is weird and stilted and not strong; he mooches the ice water; he's thin with &quot;severe&quot; features, which is a not even all that nice way of saying &quot;BLECH!&quot;; and he talks weird. Oh yeah and he has a gun, because what's better than one Big Penis Substitute? TWO Big Penis Substitutes!</p>\n<h2>Jacob Wohl Knows He Is Lying About The Hipster Coffee Shops</h2>\n<p>What's cooler than own-goaling yourself while trying to own the libs? KNOWING you're own-goaling yourself while trying to own the libs.</p>\n<p>You see, Wohl is fully aware that he's lying about hipster coffee shops (which rules out a couple of diagnoses from the manual), but it's all part of his bigger strategy, because get this, he thinks hipster coffee shops are basically church for libs, and get this, he takes the things he allegedly hears at the hipster coffee shop and get this, he changes them to the Opposite Day version, and then get this, he tweets that stuff (not anymore!) and LIBS OWNED, and he knows he has achieved LIBS OWNED because everybody in his Twitter mentions is making fun of him (where?), which means he's secretly winning the argument.</p>\n<h2>Jacob Wohl Knew He Was Lying When He Made Up That Robert Mueller Accuser</h2>\n<p>YEAH. Remember &quot;SureFire Intelligence,&quot; AKA Jacob's mom's phone number, with the fake employees and the made-up Robert Mueller accuser? You might have thought that was just another own-goal from Mr. Wohl, but NO YOU SILLY, it was another OWN-LIBBING, and here is why:</p>\n<blockquote>The woman he named as a credible accuser of the special prosecutor, Carolyne Cass, recently told USA TODAY that Wohl &quot;made it up,&quot; deceived her with a false identity ...</blockquote>\n<p>He told her he was a PI who had been trained by Mossad! Because YEAH!</p>\n<blockquote>and tried to coerce her to appear at a news conference against her will.<br><br>Wohl initially maintained that Cass's allegations were credible. When told that Cass said they were inaccurate, Wohl then claimed that he couldn't speak about the situation because of a legal non-disclosure agreement with Cass, who denied that such an agreement exists.</blockquote>\n<p>I ... we... OK ... but ...</p>\n<blockquote>Wohl claimed at the coffee shop, however, that a goal of his scheme had been to trick journalists into thinking that he had offered to pay for dirt on Mueller, so he made up a person and sent those allegations to media outlets. On his phone, he scrolled through emails from reporters at major outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and Buzzfeed who had tried to garner more information from a person who he says did not actually exist.<br><br>He described these emails-- of reporters doing their due diligence-- as trophies from a logic-stretching plan that had as the ultimate goal getting reporters to go to a news conference at a D.C.-area Holiday Inn. &quot;The real allegations against Mueller would have been ignored &hellip; had we not roped the media into attending the press conference,&quot; Wohl said.</blockquote>\n<p>ZINGED! Wonkette <em>does</em> remember a handful of reporters showing up to that thing!</p>\n<p>Jacob Wohl sure did show them!</p>\n<h2>Jacob Wohl Knows He Is Lying. You Know, Just In General. And He Has Plans To Do It A Whole Bunch More!<br></h2>\n<p>The profile is chock full of *<em>jerk-off motion</em>* quotes from Wohl about how facts aren't even a thing anymore, none of which shall we reproduce here because seriously, fuck that guy.</p>\n<p>But you should know that Wohl has big plans to do his best impression of a Russian hacker in the 2020 Democratic primary and general election, except since it's Wohl, it'll probably come off even less believable than the English as a Second Language argle-bargle put out by Russian troll farms.</p>\n<blockquote>He says he plans to create &quot;enormous left-wing online properties&quot; &ndash; such as deceptive Facebook and Twitter accounts &ndash; &quot;and use those to steer the left-wing votes in the primaries to what we feel are weaker candidates compared with Trump.&quot; It's a plot similar to what Mueller has charged in indictments that the Russians crafted in an effort to boost the 2016 campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein and hobble Hillary Clinton. </blockquote>\n<p>BUT DUMBER.</p>\n<p>Also, JACOB WOHL AND WHAT TWITTER ACCOUNT? <strong>UPDATE:</strong> This is why he <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jacob-wohl-permanently-banned-by-twitter-for-fake-accounts\">got perma-banned!</a></p>\n<blockquote>Another stated scheme: seeking to collect damaging information on left-leaning non-profits including Media Matters for America, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Right Wing Watch by offering their insiders &quot;moral reconciliation,&quot; and if that doesn't work, &quot;things of worth&quot; &ndash; such as money.</blockquote>\n<p>OK, sure, you bet!</p>\n<p>Anybody from Right Wing Watch care to comment on how this is making them feel today?</p>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1100382299554828288\"><p>Jacob Wohl is apparently offering money to Right Wing Watch &quot;insiders&quot;&mdash;is this the part where I tell him Right Wing&hellip; https://t.co/5lY25zHYm2</p> &mdash; Jared Holt (@jaredlholt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaredlholt/statuses/1100382299554828288\">1551186558.0</a></blockquote>\n<p>No fun, Jared Holt isn't even acting like he's so scared right now.</p>\n<h2>Well Thanks, Wonkette, For Wasting Our Time With This!</h2>\n<p>What? You don't want to hear about how Jacob Wohl, failed <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/that-thing-where-you-try-to-pay-women-to-accuse-robert-mueller-of-rape-but-just-end-up-boning-yourself\">Doogie Howser Fraudster Hedge Funder,</a> had a &quot;political awakening&quot; when he was in 5th grade while watching Barack Obama's inauguration, which led him to experience &quot;trepidation&quot; about the national debt, like a normal 5th grader who will one day evolve into a competent and mentally and emotionally healthy adult?</p>\n<p>Fine, fuck you then, WE WON'T TELL YOU.</p>\n<p>Have an open thread now, we guess.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/02/26/jacob-wohl-spread-twitter-lies-mueller-rbg-2020-election/2917226002/\">USA Today</a>]</p>\n<p><strong><em>Follow Evan Hurst on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/evanhurst\">RIGHT HERE, DO IT RIGHT HERE!</a></em> </strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Wonkette is ad-free and funded ONLY by YOU, our dear readers.

                "text": "USA Today has a new profile out about Jacob Wohl, the Trump starfucker diaspora's weakest and most unfuckable twinkling light, and it's worth a read if you like things that are completely shitbonkers. We've mostly been ignoring Wohl since the youngster's great #FailWeek 2018, when he invented an \"intelligence\" company (phone number for company: Jacob Wohl's mom's phone) so he could invent a story about Robert Mueller raping somebody, only to have his story fall apart repeatedly while he was telling it.\nIt's not that li'l Jacob hasn't been busy or anything. He's been in Minneapolis doing an EXCLUSIVE INVESTIGATION into Rep. Ilhan Omar with world's most embarrassing human person Laura Loomer, and, um ... yeah, we don't know why, and from reading his batshit Twitter feed, it sounds like they got assassinated in one of Minneapolis's non-existent \"no-go\" zones, but don't worry, they got better.\nBehold their posse:\nOH WAIT YOU CAN'T because while we were writing this he got suspended from Twitter! Just trust us, it was a COOL PICTURE of some people who probably shouldn't reproduce. (UPDATE: Just kidding, he's PERMA-BANNED. And why? Read on, and you will see!)a\nAnd don't think Jacob Wohl stays home lonely in the evening, because he went to CIGAR NIGHT with Mike Cernovich and that douchewanker who tweeted that list of how ladies can be more fuckable.\nTwo people who attended our last cigar night (no new invites for the next one) are in the media today. https://t.co/TfQJwWSJI8\n\u2014 Mike Cernovich | \ud83d\udcfd (@Cernovich) 1551209418.0\nNo clarifications on exactly where they put the cigars, but sure, fine, all humans deserve good clean friendship.\nANYWAY, this newspaper profile! You can read all of it if you wanna, or you can just stick with Wonkette's very brief recap, which will tell you all the important stuff you never needed to know:\nJacob Wohl Is Ugly And He Mooches Off The Free Iced Water At The Hipster Coffee Shops\nOh, but that's not all. Behold, a glorious paragraph:\nHe arrived at the Orange County cafe in a black Corvette with new-car paper license plates and extended a rigid hand but did not shake when a reporter grasped it. Sipping a free cup of ice water, the thin, severe-featured Wohl, who speaks in clipped verbiage, quickly worked into conversation that he was carrying a concealed firearm in response to the \"voluminous left-wing threats\" he has received.\nHow much #Loser can you cram into one graf? Damn! He's spending his publicity money like an idiot on BPS cars (Big Penis Substitute, not to be confused with BPTs, which are Matthew Whitaker's Big Peener Toilets); his handshake is weird and stilted and not strong; he mooches the ice water; he's thin with \"severe\" features, which is a not even all that nice way of saying \"BLECH!\"; and he talks weird. Oh yeah and he has a gun, because what's better than one Big Penis Substitute? TWO Big Penis Substitutes!\nJacob Wohl Knows He Is Lying About The Hipster Coffee Shops\nWhat's cooler than own-goaling yourself while trying to own the libs? KNOWING you're own-goaling yourself while trying to own the libs.\nYou see, Wohl is fully aware that he's lying about hipster coffee shops (which rules out a couple of diagnoses from the manual), but it's all part of his bigger strategy, because get this, he thinks hipster coffee shops are basically church for libs, and get this, he takes the things he allegedly hears at the hipster coffee shop and get this, he changes them to the Opposite Day version, and then get this, he tweets that stuff (not anymore!) and LIBS OWNED, and he knows he has achieved LIBS OWNED because everybody in his Twitter mentions is making fun of him (where?), which means he's secretly winning the argument.\nJacob Wohl Knew He Was Lying When He Made Up That Robert Mueller Accuser\nYEAH. Remember \"SureFire Intelligence,\" AKA Jacob's mom's phone number, with the fake employees and the made-up Robert Mueller accuser? You might have thought that was just another own-goal from Mr. Wohl, but NO YOU SILLY, it was another OWN-LIBBING, and here is why:\nThe woman he named as a credible accuser of the special prosecutor, Carolyne Cass, recently told USA TODAY that Wohl \"made it up,\" deceived her with a false identity ...\nHe told her he was a PI who had been trained by Mossad! Because YEAH!\nand tried to coerce her to appear at a news conference against her will.\nWohl initially maintained that Cass's allegations were credible. When told that Cass said they were inaccurate, Wohl then claimed that he couldn't speak about the situation because of a legal non-disclosure agreement with Cass, who denied that such an agreement exists.\nI ... we... OK ... but ...\nWohl claimed at the coffee shop, however, that a goal of his scheme had been to trick journalists into thinking that he had offered to pay for dirt on Mueller, so he made up a person and sent those allegations to media outlets. On his phone, he scrolled through emails from reporters at major outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and Buzzfeed who had tried to garner more information from a person who he says did not actually exist.\nHe described these emails-- of reporters doing their due diligence-- as trophies from a logic-stretching plan that had as the ultimate goal getting reporters to go to a news conference at a D.C.-area Holiday Inn. \"The real allegations against Mueller would have been ignored \u2026 had we not roped the media into attending the press conference,\" Wohl said.\nZINGED! Wonkette does remember a handful of reporters showing up to that thing!\nJacob Wohl sure did show them!\nJacob Wohl Knows He Is Lying. You Know, Just In General. And He Has Plans To Do It A Whole Bunch More!\nThe profile is chock full of *jerk-off motion* quotes from Wohl about how facts aren't even a thing anymore, none of which shall we reproduce here because seriously, fuck that guy.\nBut you should know that Wohl has big plans to do his best impression of a Russian hacker in the 2020 Democratic primary and general election, except since it's Wohl, it'll probably come off even less believable than the English as a Second Language argle-bargle put out by Russian troll farms.\nHe says he plans to create \"enormous left-wing online properties\" \u2013 such as deceptive Facebook and Twitter accounts \u2013 \"and use those to steer the left-wing votes in the primaries to what we feel are weaker candidates compared with Trump.\" It's a plot similar to what Mueller has charged in indictments that the Russians crafted in an effort to boost the 2016 campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein and hobble Hillary Clinton.\nBUT DUMBER.\nAlso, JACOB WOHL AND WHAT TWITTER ACCOUNT? UPDATE: This is why he got perma-banned!\nAnother stated scheme: seeking to collect damaging information on left-leaning non-profits including Media Matters for America, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Right Wing Watch by offering their insiders \"moral reconciliation,\" and if that doesn't work, \"things of worth\" \u2013 such as money.\nOK, sure, you bet!\nAnybody from Right Wing Watch care to comment on how this is making them feel today?\nJacob Wohl is apparently offering money to Right Wing Watch \"insiders\"\u2014is this the part where I tell him Right Wing\u2026 https://t.co/5lY25zHYm2\n\u2014 Jared Holt (@jaredlholt) 1551186558.0\nNo fun, Jared Holt isn't even acting like he's so scared right now.\nWell Thanks, Wonkette, For Wasting Our Time With This!\nWhat? You don't want to hear about how Jacob Wohl, failed Doogie Howser Fraudster Hedge Funder, had a \"political awakening\" when he was in 5th grade while watching Barack Obama's inauguration, which led him to experience \"trepidation\" about the national debt, like a normal 5th grader who will one day evolve into a competent and mentally and emotionally healthy adult?\nFine, fuck you then, WE WON'T TELL YOU.\nHave an open thread now, we guess.\n[USA Today]\nFollow Evan Hurst on Twitter RIGHT HERE, DO IT RIGHT HERE!\nWonkette is ad-free and funded ONLY by YOU, our dear readers.

                "html": "<p>That's right, Wonkers, it is time for another post about Mayor Pete Buttigieg, because everybody is feeling the BUTT-MENTUM, and you're just along for the ride! Yesterday, we all watched Mayor Pete's <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/pete-buttigieg-kickoff-speech\">official campaign announcement speech,</a> which made everybody cry a lot or something (FULL DISCLOSURE have not watched actually). On Monday night, Buttigieg was Rachel Maddow's guest, and they talked about pretty much everything, but what was most interesting to us, from our own gay perspective, was their rather personal talk about coming out and what that means just in general, and now especially for somebody who is legit running for president of the United States.</p>\n<p>Maddow acknowledged at the beginning of the conversation that it was a bit different from other times when she's questioned candidates, because of how she herself is a lesbian and has personal experience with coming out. Maddow also noted that she and Buttigieg were both Rhodes scholars, and that she was the first openly gay American Rhodes scholar. Buttigieg, meanwhile, came out much later at 33. How did that work for him? Maddow said for her, personally, it would have killed her to stay in the closet so long. Her question, specifically, was <em>was it hurtful</em> to experience that much time in the closet.</p>\n<p>Like we said, it's a different conversation from the one you're going to see with any of the other candidates, or a conversation with another journalist. It's almost a moment that, if we're being honest, as a gay person, feels intensely <em>familiar. </em>So it's more than a little bit surreal that it's a conversation with one of the higher-polling candidates in the Democratic primary:</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Y9brETpVaU?list=PLDIVi-vBsOEyETRGoRP9y8zhyu6bHl6iK&rel=0\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>&quot;It took me plenty of time to come out to myself,&quot; said Buttigieg. &quot;I needed to not be. There's this war that breaks out inside a lot of people, when they realize they might be something they're afraid of.&quot; Behind every openly LGBT person's coming out story is a sometimes more <em>personally</em> significant story, of when we came out to <em>ourselves</em>. It might not immediately make sense as a concept for YOU CISHETS, but it's a moment of acceptance, where one travels the distance to actually being <em>OK</em> with it. For lucky people, that's a quick moment and happens pretty much concurrently with the initial realization that you're different. For others, it can take years. (We personally were 19 when we came out, both to ourselves and to others, after being in the closet as long as we could remember.)</p>\n<p>Holy crap, to all LGBTs reading, we are talking about this with a <em>person running for president</em>.</p>\n<p>Buttigieg talked about the conflict he felt as a person serving in the military and as an elected official, that weird thing many LGBT people experience where they really give a shit about what they're doing in life, and <em>for some reason</em> it feels like they have to choose between that thing and living authentically. Spoiler alert, it sucks.</p>\n<p>But eventually, after he was elected mayor, the moment came, he came out, he was re-elected with 80 percent of the vote, and here we are! Pete Buttigieg, who is married to Chasten, is an out gay man, people like him quite a lot, and oh yeah, he simply <em>will not</em> stop <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/11/he-knows-better-pete-buttigieg-has-made-mike-pence-his-target-vice-president-isnt-pleased/\">giving Mike Pence shit</a> for being a gigantic bigot.</p>\n<p>As the conversation was ending, Buttigieg said, &quot;You only get to be one person. You don't know how long you have on this earth,&quot; and added that whatever happens with his campaign, he hopes he can &quot;make it a little easier, just by being here, for the next [LGBT] person who comes along.&quot;</p>\n<p>After the interview was over, Maddow reflected on the conversation she had just had with Buttigieg, during her handover with Lawrence O'Donnell. She specifically talked about why she, as a gay woman, wanted to talk to Buttigieg, a gay man, about his experience of the closet. Watch that by clicking this link right here:</p>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1118255342855626753\"><p>Rachel Maddow on 'when it comes to coming out' https://t.co/pITVwm59S1 via @msnbc</p> &mdash; Evan Hurst (@EvanHurst) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvanHurst/statuses/1118255342855626753\">1555447824.0</a></blockquote>\n<p>Hey CISHETS! Don't you feel like you are learning things about the gays right now?</p>\n<p>If you haven't watched it yet, this all reminds us of the part of Buttigieg's <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/pete-buttigieg-kickoff-speech\">announcement speech</a> this weekend, where he talked about what he would tell the 17-year-old version of himself if he could, which, again, haven't watched, we're going by Wonkette's helpful summary:</p>\n<blockquote> To tell him he'll be all right. More than all right. To tell him that one rainy April day, before he even turns forty, he'll wake up to headlines about whether he's rising too quickly as he becomes a top-tier contender for the American presidency. And to tell him that on that day he announces his campaign for president, he'll do it with his husband looking on. </blockquote>\n<p>MAN, we should really watch that speech, shouldn't we!</p>\n<p>The whole Maddow interview is worth watching. In the <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/pete-buttigieg-democrats-have-to-reclaim-the-values-argument-1494493763929\">first section,</a> Buttigieg talks about striking the balance between advocating specific policies <em>vs</em>. winning the argument against Republicans on values, and how best to do both. That <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/buttigieg-american-interests-and-american-values-are-inseparable-1494496323606\">leads into a conversation</a> about what in the actual hell <em>American values</em> are, an important conversation in this time of trying to save America from Donald Trump, particularly as Trump plays footsie with Vladimir Putin while scratch 'n' sniffing Kim Jong Un's love notes. Then they <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/buttigieg-voters-already-know-trump-is-not-a-good-guy-1494496835809\">talk about</a> the impending release of Bill Barr's redacted version of the Mueller report, with Buttigieg dispelling the notion that we're going to find out some smoking gun thing that tells everybody what a horrible piece of shit Trump is, because WE ALREADY KNOW THAT.</p>\n<p>Want more video? Here's more video of Buttigieg talking about calling for national service as part of his campaign platform, citing his experience in the Navy and what he learned there.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8kreEg7itlw?list=PLDIVi-vBsOEyETRGoRP9y8zhyu6bHl6iK&rel=0\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Also Mayor Pete said he and his husband Chasten have been talking about having kids but those plans sound like they're kind of slowed down for the moment because SOME DICKHEAD is quote unquote &quot;running for president,&quot; what a dickhead THAT dickhead sounds like, FUCKIN' DICK, THE END.</p>\n<p>Hey, have an OPEN THREAD!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Wonkette is ad-free and funded ONLY by YOU, our dear readers.

                "text": "That's right, Wonkers, it is time for another post about Mayor Pete Buttigieg, because everybody is feeling the BUTT-MENTUM, and you're just along for the ride! Yesterday, we all watched Mayor Pete's official campaign announcement speech, which made everybody cry a lot or something (FULL DISCLOSURE have not watched actually). On Monday night, Buttigieg was Rachel Maddow's guest, and they talked about pretty much everything, but what was most interesting to us, from our own gay perspective, was their rather personal talk about coming out and what that means just in general, and now especially for somebody who is legit running for president of the United States.\nMaddow acknowledged at the beginning of the conversation that it was a bit different from other times when she's questioned candidates, because of how she herself is a lesbian and has personal experience with coming out. Maddow also noted that she and Buttigieg were both Rhodes scholars, and that she was the first openly gay American Rhodes scholar. Buttigieg, meanwhile, came out much later at 33. How did that work for him? Maddow said for her, personally, it would have killed her to stay in the closet so long. Her question, specifically, was was it hurtful to experience that much time in the closet.\nLike we said, it's a different conversation from the one you're going to see with any of the other candidates, or a conversation with another journalist. It's almost a moment that, if we're being honest, as a gay person, feels intensely familiar. So it's more than a little bit surreal that it's a conversation with one of the higher-polling candidates in the Democratic primary:\n\"It took me plenty of time to come out to myself,\" said Buttigieg. \"I needed to not be. There's this war that breaks out inside a lot of people, when they realize they might be something they're afraid of.\" Behind every openly LGBT person's coming out story is a sometimes more personally significant story, of when we came out to ourselves. It might not immediately make sense as a concept for YOU CISHETS, but it's a moment of acceptance, where one travels the distance to actually being OK with it. For lucky people, that's a quick moment and happens pretty much concurrently with the initial realization that you're different. For others, it can take years. (We personally were 19 when we came out, both to ourselves and to others, after being in the closet as long as we could remember.)\nHoly crap, to all LGBTs reading, we are talking about this with a person running for president.\nButtigieg talked about the conflict he felt as a person serving in the military and as an elected official, that weird thing many LGBT people experience where they really give a shit about what they're doing in life, and for some reason it feels like they have to choose between that thing and living authentically. Spoiler alert, it sucks.\nBut eventually, after he was elected mayor, the moment came, he came out, he was re-elected with 80 percent of the vote, and here we are! Pete Buttigieg, who is married to Chasten, is an out gay man, people like him quite a lot, and oh yeah, he simply will not stop giving Mike Pence shit for being a gigantic bigot.\nAs the conversation was ending, Buttigieg said, \"You only get to be one person. You don't know how long you have on this earth,\" and added that whatever happens with his campaign, he hopes he can \"make it a little easier, just by being here, for the next [LGBT] person who comes along.\"\nAfter the interview was over, Maddow reflected on the conversation she had just had with Buttigieg, during her handover with Lawrence O'Donnell. She specifically talked about why she, as a gay woman, wanted to talk to Buttigieg, a gay man, about his experience of the closet. Watch that by clicking this link right here:\nRachel Maddow on 'when it comes to coming out' https://t.co/pITVwm59S1 via @msnbc\n\u2014 Evan Hurst (@EvanHurst) 1555447824.0\nHey CISHETS! Don't you feel like you are learning things about the gays right now?\nIf you haven't watched it yet, this all reminds us of the part of Buttigieg's announcement speech this weekend, where he talked about what he would tell the 17-year-old version of himself if he could, which, again, haven't watched, we're going by Wonkette's helpful summary:\nTo tell him he'll be all right. More than all right. To tell him that one rainy April day, before he even turns forty, he'll wake up to headlines about whether he's rising too quickly as he becomes a top-tier contender for the American presidency. And to tell him that on that day he announces his campaign for president, he'll do it with his husband looking on.\nMAN, we should really watch that speech, shouldn't we!\nThe whole Maddow interview is worth watching. In the first section, Buttigieg talks about striking the balance between advocating specific policies vs. winning the argument against Republicans on values, and how best to do both. That leads into a conversation about what in the actual hell American values are, an important conversation in this time of trying to save America from Donald Trump, particularly as Trump plays footsie with Vladimir Putin while scratch 'n' sniffing Kim Jong Un's love notes. Then they talk about the impending release of Bill Barr's redacted version of the Mueller report, with Buttigieg dispelling the notion that we're going to find out some smoking gun thing that tells everybody what a horrible piece of shit Trump is, because WE ALREADY KNOW THAT.\nWant more video? Here's more video of Buttigieg talking about calling for national service as part of his campaign platform, citing his experience in the Navy and what he learned there.\nAlso Mayor Pete said he and his husband Chasten have been talking about having kids but those plans sound like they're kind of slowed down for the moment because SOME DICKHEAD is quote unquote \"running for president,\" what a dickhead THAT dickhead sounds like, FUCKIN' DICK, THE END.\nHey, have an OPEN THREAD!\nWonkette is ad-free and funded ONLY by YOU, our dear readers.

While Donald Trump is off in Vietnam doing a last ditch effort to save his presidency at his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and while all Trump's staffers are <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/22/trump-north-korea-nuclear-summit-hanoi-strategy-1179753\">not-so-secretly worried</a> that Trump is going to fuck it all up because he <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/love-connection-why-intel-officials-are-worried-about-trump-kim-n975611\">has a crush on Kim</a> (he will) and also because Trump is very stupid (he is), something VERY INTERESTING is happening back in Washington DC! Trump's former lawyer thug fixer idiot Michael Cohen has dates to testify before Congress all week long, centering around the main event on Wednesday: public testimony before the House Oversight Committee.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and Cohen's bringing receipts. You know, in case you are a concern troll like they show on Fox News, and you're wondering how we can we trust Cohen's testimony, when Cohen is a &quot;CONVICTED FELON AND KNOWN LIAR!&quot; We of course refer to Donald Trump Jr., who <a href=\"https://insider.foxnews.com/2019/02/25/donald-trump-jr-michael-cohen-mueller-probe-trump-kim-hanoi-summit\">went on Fox News</a> on Monday to whine that DADDY is in VEE-NAM doing something 'PORTANT, and it's &quot;DISGUSTING&quot; that the &quot;DEMOCRATS&quot; would bring A GUY WHO PROBABLY CHANGED JUNIOR'S DIAPERS WHEN JUNIOR WAS IN COLLEGE to testify, because that guy is DISLOYAL. WAAAAAAAAAAAAH!</p>\n<p>(You are envisioning Michael Cohen changing <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/trump-jr-diaper-don\">Diaper Don's</a> diapers right now. Haha.)</p>\n<p>On top of how the general sense we get from Michael Cohen is that lying to Congress all the time was <em>so last year</em>, he's planning to bring documents and transcripts and receipts and probably pee tapes with him to Congress, so people know he's not fibbin'. Oh yeah, and at this point in Cohen's life, much of what he says will have the benefit of being backed up by court filings from prosecutors in all the cases against him, which by definition means prosecutors have fact-checked what he's told them.</p>\n<p>NBC News's Ken Dilanian <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/02/25/michael-cohen-prepared-to-address-credibility-issues-before-congress-hes-coming-with-documents_partner/\">described</a> what sorts of souvenirs Cohen is bringing for the Congressfolks on &quot;Morning Joe&quot;:</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;I'm told Cohen has been prepping with this for a long time, and he knows he's got credibility issues, so he's coming with documents,&quot; Dilanian said, &quot;and he's got very detailed, sordid and, what (attorney) Lanny Davis has described as chilling stories of how the president conducts himself behind closed doors.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>Oh, FUN!</p>\n<p>Maggie Haberman <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/us/politics/michael-cohen-testimony.html\">augments</a> Dilanian's reporting at the <em>New York Times</em>, saying Cohen is going to talk about Trump being a big racist who lies about how rich he is, and maybe even talk about what it's like to be in the room when Trump commits crimes. Indeed, Haberman's source said Cohen will discuss &quot;evidence of potential criminal conduct <em>since Mr. Trump became president</em>,&quot; specifically regarding the continued cover-up over the illegal hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, payments Trump made in order to benefit his presidential campaign. When Cohen <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/michael-cohen-guilty\">pleaded guilty</a> to charges related to those payments, he told the judge he did that stuff <em>at the direction of</em> a man we all know as &quot;Individual-1,&quot; who is currently the president of the United States.</p>\n<p>As far as Russia stuff goes, there <em>probably</em> won't be that much of it, because of the ongoing Robert Mueller investigation and the public nature of Cohen's testimony, but he will obviously <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/michael-cohen-says-hes-guilty-as-f-ck-again-but-this-time-its-for-mueller-stuff\">address his earlier lies to Congress</a> about Trump's involvement in the failed Trump Tower Moscow project, which was ongoing during the campaign, while Trump was looking the American people in the face and lying and saying he had nothing to do with Russia.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/cohen-to-testify-that-trump-engaged-in-criminal-conduct-while-in-office-11551175201?mod=breakingnews\">says</a> Cohen is bringing <em>financial statements</em> on Trump. And Haberman's source says Cohen's visual aids will be presented in a way that lets the viewers at home and on Wonkette can see 'em <em>nice and clear</em>. Ayup!</p>\n<p>Tell us what your sources are saying about Cohen's testimony, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/michael-cohen-preparing-to-shock-lawmakers-with-disclosures\">Emily Jane Fox </a>at <em>Vanity Fair</em>!</p>\n<blockquote> &quot;Some things that are earth-shattering are right in front of your nose, and the reason you don't know that they're earth-shattering is because they're right in front of you,&quot; one person told me.</blockquote>\n<p>Should we like ... order pizza for this? We should order pizza for this. And maybe vodka.</p>\n<p>From what Wonkette has heard from the pundits on the television, White House aides are nervous about Cohen's testimony, but reportedly happy that Trump is in Vietnam and has more than HAMBERDER EXECUTIVE UNDERPANTS TIME on his schedule for once, which means he won't be able to obsess over Cohen's testimony <em>quite</em> as much as he usually would. Of course, as Emily Jane Fox notes, the very timing of this is likely to drive President Shitmouth crazy, since it will <em>completely</em> overshadow Trump getting pantsed by the North Korean dictator.</p>\n<p>Wonkette, of course, will be liveblogging the entire shitshow, and we cannot wait. The Republicans on the committee will scream at Cohen and say &quot;SAYS WHO!&quot; and call him a liar, because we're all supposed to pretend this guy wasn't the president's most true and faithful servant for over a decade. We imagine the Dems will have some fun questions too.</p>\n<p>Who's ready for the president to be humiliated on live TV while he's getting fucked on the world stage too?

                "text": "What fun! While Donald Trump is off in Vietnam doing a last ditch effort to save his presidency at his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and while all Trump's staffers are not-so-secretly worried that Trump is going to fuck it all up because he has a crush on Kim (he will) and also because Trump is very stupid (he is), something VERY INTERESTING is happening back in Washington DC! Trump's former lawyer thug fixer idiot Michael Cohen has dates to testify before Congress all week long, centering around the main event on Wednesday: public testimony before the House Oversight Committee.\nOh yeah, and Cohen's bringing receipts. You know, in case you are a concern troll like they show on Fox News, and you're wondering how we can we trust Cohen's testimony, when Cohen is a \"CONVICTED FELON AND KNOWN LIAR!\" We of course refer to Donald Trump Jr., who went on Fox News on Monday to whine that DADDY is in VEE-NAM doing something 'PORTANT, and it's \"DISGUSTING\" that the \"DEMOCRATS\" would bring A GUY WHO PROBABLY CHANGED JUNIOR'S DIAPERS WHEN JUNIOR WAS IN COLLEGE to testify, because that guy is DISLOYAL. WAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\n(You are envisioning Michael Cohen changing Diaper Don's diapers right now. Haha.)\nOn top of how the general sense we get from Michael Cohen is that lying to Congress all the time was so last year, he's planning to bring documents and transcripts and receipts and probably pee tapes with him to Congress, so people know he's not fibbin'. Oh yeah, and at this point in Cohen's life, much of what he says will have the benefit of being backed up by court filings from prosecutors in all the cases against him, which by definition means prosecutors have fact-checked what he's told them.\nNBC News's Ken Dilanian described what sorts of souvenirs Cohen is bringing for the Congressfolks on \"Morning Joe\":\n\"I'm told Cohen has been prepping with this for a long time, and he knows he's got credibility issues, so he's coming with documents,\" Dilanian said, \"and he's got very detailed, sordid and, what (attorney) Lanny Davis has described as chilling stories of how the president conducts himself behind closed doors.\"\nOh, FUN!\nMaggie Haberman augments Dilanian's reporting at the New York Times, saying Cohen is going to talk about Trump being a big racist who lies about how rich he is, and maybe even talk about what it's like to be in the room when Trump commits crimes. Indeed, Haberman's source said Cohen will discuss \"evidence of potential criminal conduct since Mr. Trump became president,\" specifically regarding the continued cover-up over the illegal hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, payments Trump made in order to benefit his presidential campaign. When Cohen pleaded guilty to charges related to those payments, he told the judge he did that stuff at the direction of a man we all know as \"Individual-1,\" who is currently the president of the United States.\nAs far as Russia stuff goes, there probably won't be that much of it, because of the ongoing Robert Mueller investigation and the public nature of Cohen's testimony, but he will obviously address his earlier lies to Congress about Trump's involvement in the failed Trump Tower Moscow project, which was ongoing during the campaign, while Trump was looking the American people in the face and lying and saying he had nothing to do with Russia.\nOh, and the Wall Street Journal says Cohen is bringing financial statements on Trump. And Haberman's source says Cohen's visual aids will be presented in a way that lets the viewers at home and on Wonkette can see 'em nice and clear. Ayup!\nTell us what your sources are saying about Cohen's testimony, Emily Jane Fox at Vanity Fair!\n\"Some things that are earth-shattering are right in front of your nose, and the reason you don't know that they're earth-shattering is because they're right in front of you,\" one person told me.\nShould we like ... order pizza for this? We should order pizza for this. And maybe vodka.\nFrom what Wonkette has heard from the pundits on the television, White House aides are nervous about Cohen's testimony, but reportedly happy that Trump is in Vietnam and has more than HAMBERDER EXECUTIVE UNDERPANTS TIME on his schedule for once, which means he won't be able to obsess over Cohen's testimony quite as much as he usually would. Of course, as Emily Jane Fox notes, the very timing of this is likely to drive President Shitmouth crazy, since it will completely overshadow Trump getting pantsed by the North Korean dictator.\nWonkette, of course, will be liveblogging the entire shitshow, and we cannot wait. The Republicans on the committee will scream at Cohen and say \"SAYS WHO!\" and call him a liar, because we're all supposed to pretend this guy wasn't the president's most true and faithful servant for over a decade. We imagine the Dems will have some fun questions too.\nWho's ready for the president to be humiliated on live TV while he's getting fucked on the world stage too?

Or at least an attempt to condemn the fraud and insist that sort of thing has no place in the fine, upstanding Republican Party. Instead, ugly bag of mostly <em>chutzpah</em> and turtle meat Mitch McConnell<a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1100414132531060737\"> insisted today</a> that cheating by a Republican simply proves that Democrats are unbelievably corrupt when they say fraud by individual voters is not a serious problem (which of course it is not). Damn it, said McConnell, see what happens without voter ID? Also, please nobody point out that voter ID would have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/11/18134636/north-carolina-9-election-fraud-voter-fraud\">done absolutely fuck-all</a> to prevent the fraud in NC-09, because the fraud didn't happen at the polls.</p>\n<p>Guys, we think we've figured out why Republicans oppose the Green New Deal. Clearly, they worry eliminating fossil fuels might make gaslighting harder.</p>\n<p>Here's Yertle just plain lying, and not coincidentally providing the go-to talking point for all right-wing discussion of NC-09:</p>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1100414132531060737\"><p>On Senate floor, @senatemajldr McConnell shamelessly blames Dems for Mark Harris' election fraud in North Carolina,&hellip; https://t.co/lQd2zBoIwY</p> &mdash; Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/statuses/1100414132531060737\">1551194148.0</a></blockquote>\n<p>We're impressed by McConnell's description of the fraud. It's not that Republican Mark Harris hired a guy who ran an operation to illegally collect voters' mail-in ballots and fill them out to benefit Harris. Or that the same GOP operative may have discarded likely Democratic ballots. Heavens no! It just sort of <em>happened,</em> incidentally benefiting the Republican:</p>\n<blockquote>Soon after election day, allegations of illegal ballot harvesting and vote tampering clouded a close result. The wrongdoing seemed to have benefited the Republican candidate over the Democrat. </blockquote>\n<p>Mistakes were made. Jesus, Mitch, there's passive voice, and then there's lie-down drunk on the kitchen floor and weep voice. Now take a look at the very subtle shift in blame -- ballot tampering by a Republican? Nah, let's blame fraud by voters!</p>\n<blockquote>For years and years, every Republican who dared to call for common-sense safeguards for Americans' ballots was demonized by Democrats and their allies. We were hit with left-wing talking points insisting that voter fraud wasn't real. &quot;Never happens,&quot; they said [...]<br><br>Now that an incident of very real voter fraud has become national news and the Republican candidate seems to have benefited, these longstanding Democratic talking points have been really quiet. Haven't heard much lately from Democrats lately about how fraud really happens. They've gone silent. Now there's a new interest in ensuring the sanctity of American elections. </blockquote>\n<p>Actually, no, there has not suddenly been a flood of Democrats calling for voter ID, because voter ID wouldn't have helped at all here. Absentee ballots were taken and fraudulently filled out by a GOP operative who <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/nc9\">knew damned well what he was doing</a> was illegal. Forcing people to get an acceptable photo ID would not have stopped that, and there is still <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/debunking-voter-fraud-myth\">no evidence anywhere in the USA</a> of massive &quot;fraud&quot; <em>by voters.</em></p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Dan McCready, the sore loser Democrat who somehow didn't happen to benefit from the election fraud perpetrated by a guy hired by Mark Harris, didn't seem to appreciate McConnell's call to secure our elections by making it harder for Americans to vote. This is because he clearly likes illegal voting.</p>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1100449286830149633\"><p>Shameful @senatemajldr that you would twist #nc09 election fraud into your made-up witch-hunt for voter fraud. Eve&hellip; https://t.co/d9bYDP9jKE</p> &mdash; Dan McCready for NC (@McCreadyForNC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/McCreadyForNC/statuses/1100449286830149633\">1551202529.0</a></blockquote>\n<p>Well, yes, but the voters were still <em>involved,</em> now weren't they? In fact, there's no denying that some of them may have even intended to vote for a Democrat. That is in itself a kind of fraud, because <em>real </em>Americans vote for Republicans. Obviously, that's why patriots like Mark Harris sometimes need to hire someone to help correct such errors.</p>\n<p>Oh, hey, speaking of voter ID: On Friday, a North Carolina state court actually <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article226652589.html\">threw out the state's constitutional amendment </a>requiring voter ID, on the grounds that the state's Republican-dominated legislature <em>is itself illegitimate</em> thanks to outrageous gerrymandering.</p>\n<p>Wake County Superior Court Judge G. Bryan Collins wrote in his decision that the amendment to the state constitution, and another ballot measure capping the state's income tax, were both null and void from the get-go:</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;An illegally constituted General Assembly does not represent the people of North Carolina and is therefore not empowered to pass legislation that would amend the state's constitution,&quot; he wrote. <br><br>When the legislature wrote the amendments and voted to place them on the 2018 ballot, many of the members who voted to do so had been elected under district lines that were ruled unconstitutional because they had been drawn to dilute the political power of African-American voters. </blockquote>\n<p>This is the second time a North Carolina voter ID law has been declared unconstitutional. The first time around, a federal court held the law had been designed to <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/supreme-court-not-having-north-carolinas-jim-crow\">&quot;target African Americans with almost surgical precision.&quot;</a></p>\n<p>Yr Wonkette is looking forward to Mitch McConnell explaining that if only there had been strict Voter ID at the time, Republicans never would have needed to gerrymander the state lege.</p>\n<p><strong>Yr Wonkette is supported by reader donations.

                "text": "In any sane reality, last week's vote to hold a new election in North Carolina's ninth congressional district following pervasive absentee ballot fraud by a GOP operative might provoke shame among Republicans. Or at least an attempt to condemn the fraud and insist that sort of thing has no place in the fine, upstanding Republican Party. Instead, ugly bag of mostly chutzpah and turtle meat Mitch McConnell insisted today that cheating by a Republican simply proves that Democrats are unbelievably corrupt when they say fraud by individual voters is not a serious problem (which of course it is not). Damn it, said McConnell, see what happens without voter ID? Also, please nobody point out that voter ID would have done absolutely fuck-all to prevent the fraud in NC-09, because the fraud didn't happen at the polls.\nGuys, we think we've figured out why Republicans oppose the Green New Deal. Clearly, they worry eliminating fossil fuels might make gaslighting harder.\nHere's Yertle just plain lying, and not coincidentally providing the go-to talking point for all right-wing discussion of NC-09:\nOn Senate floor, @senatemajldr McConnell shamelessly blames Dems for Mark Harris' election fraud in North Carolina,\u2026 https://t.co/lQd2zBoIwY\n\u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) 1551194148.0\nWe're impressed by McConnell's description of the fraud. It's not that Republican Mark Harris hired a guy who ran an operation to illegally collect voters' mail-in ballots and fill them out to benefit Harris. Or that the same GOP operative may have discarded likely Democratic ballots. Heavens no! It just sort of happened, incidentally benefiting the Republican:\nSoon after election day, allegations of illegal ballot harvesting and vote tampering clouded a close result. The wrongdoing seemed to have benefited the Republican candidate over the Democrat.\nMistakes were made. Jesus, Mitch, there's passive voice, and then there's lie-down drunk on the kitchen floor and weep voice. Now take a look at the very subtle shift in blame -- ballot tampering by a Republican? Nah, let's blame fraud by voters!\nFor years and years, every Republican who dared to call for common-sense safeguards for Americans' ballots was demonized by Democrats and their allies. We were hit with left-wing talking points insisting that voter fraud wasn't real. \"Never happens,\" they said [...]\nNow that an incident of very real voter fraud has become national news and the Republican candidate seems to have benefited, these longstanding Democratic talking points have been really quiet. Haven't heard much lately from Democrats lately about how fraud really happens. They've gone silent. Now there's a new interest in ensuring the sanctity of American elections.\nActually, no, there has not suddenly been a flood of Democrats calling for voter ID, because voter ID wouldn't have helped at all here. Absentee ballots were taken and fraudulently filled out by a GOP operative who knew damned well what he was doing was illegal. Forcing people to get an acceptable photo ID would not have stopped that, and there is still no evidence anywhere in the USA of massive \"fraud\" by voters.\nNot surprisingly, Dan McCready, the sore loser Democrat who somehow didn't happen to benefit from the election fraud perpetrated by a guy hired by Mark Harris, didn't seem to appreciate McConnell's call to secure our elections by making it harder for Americans to vote. This is because he clearly likes illegal voting.\nShameful @senatemajldr that you would twist #nc09 election fraud into your made-up witch-hunt for voter fraud. Eve\u2026 https://t.co/d9bYDP9jKE\n\u2014 Dan McCready for NC (@McCreadyForNC) 1551202529.0\nWell, yes, but the voters were still involved, now weren't they? In fact, there's no denying that some of them may have even intended to vote for a Democrat. That is in itself a kind of fraud, because real Americans vote for Republicans. Obviously, that's why patriots like Mark Harris sometimes need to hire someone to help correct such errors.\nOh, hey, speaking of voter ID: On Friday, a North Carolina state court actually threw out the state's constitutional amendment requiring voter ID, on the grounds that the state's Republican-dominated legislature is itself illegitimate thanks to outrageous gerrymandering.\nWake County Superior Court Judge G. Bryan Collins wrote in his decision that the amendment to the state constitution, and another ballot measure capping the state's income tax, were both null and void from the get-go:\n\"An illegally constituted General Assembly does not represent the people of North Carolina and is therefore not empowered to pass legislation that would amend the state's constitution,\" he wrote.\nWhen the legislature wrote the amendments and voted to place them on the 2018 ballot, many of the members who voted to do so had been elected under district lines that were ruled unconstitutional because they had been drawn to dilute the political power of African-American voters.\nThis is the second time a North Carolina voter ID law has been declared unconstitutional. The first time around, a federal court held the law had been designed to \"target African Americans with almost surgical precision.\"\nYr Wonkette is looking forward to Mitch McConnell explaining that if only there had been strict Voter ID at the time, Republicans never would have needed to gerrymander the state lege.\nYr Wonkette is supported by reader donations.

                "html": "<p>People have expressed <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/lindsey-graham-lock-her-up\">concern</a> that Lindsey Graham's shameless about-face regarding Donald Trump is due to Russian influence or what's known as &quot;kompromat.&quot; That's not a Russian salad dressing but compromising material about someone. However, this theory requires that Graham is a character from a Shakespearean tragedy rather than your garden variety sell-out puppet job who is desperate for attention.</p>\n<p>During an interview with the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/magazine/lindsey-graham-what-happened-trump.html\">New York Times, </a>Graham admitted that his primary objective is to remain &quot;relevant.&quot; That feels more like a quote from a mid-'90s Madonna interview than one with a US senator. Madonna never lowered her dignity to perform with Courtney Love, even at the height of grunge. Graham has had no problem becoming bosom buddies with Trump, a man he once <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/maybe-lindsey-graham-isnt-compromised-maybe-hes-just-soulless-scum\">described</a> as a &quot;race-baiting, xenophobic religious bigot.&quot;</p>\n<blockquote> Politics, [Graham] explained, was the art of what works and what brings desired outcomes. &quot;I've got an opportunity up here working with the president to get some really good outcomes for the country,&quot; he told me. </blockquote>\n<p>Graham is senator of our home state so we can appreciate his focus on &quot;outcomes.&quot; South Carolina could use some infrastructure, maybe some schools. Tell us more about these &quot;really good outcomes,&quot; Lindsey.</p>\n<blockquote> An outcome of particular interest to Graham, at the moment, is getting re-elected to a fourth Senate term in South Carolina, where Trump owns commanding approval numbers, especially among the hard-core Republicans who in the past questioned Graham's devotion to their conservative cause.</blockquote>\n<p>Wait, hold up: Graham's trying to stay &quot;relevant&quot; so he can work with <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/sunday-the-beginning-of-the-end\">Individual 1</a> to further his larger goal of ... keeping his job. That's it? There has to be more to serving in the Senate than just getting re-elected.</p>\n<blockquote> &quot;If you don't want to get re-elected, you're in the wrong business,&quot; he said. </blockquote>\n<p>Supporting Trump can certainly help Graham get re-elected in South Carolina. Over the past year, Graham's approval rating among Republicans has <a href=\"https://www.wltx.com/article/news/politics/president-trumps-approval-rating-in-south-carolina-above-national-average-poll-finds/101-610253312\">increased</a> from 51 percent to 72 percent. That's enough to hold off any primary challenge in 2020. All he had to do was cozy up to Trump and personally attack Democrats while defending Brett Kavanaugh from accountability. This might've permanently damaged his working relationship with Democrat Chris Coons, a longtime colleague, but who cares? His new bestie is the president of the freaking United States!</p>\n<blockquote> &quot;I have never been called this much by a president in my life,&quot; [Graham said.] His tone reflected a mixture of amazement and amusement, with perhaps a dash of awe. &quot;It's weird, and it's flattering, and it creates some opportunity. It also creates some pressure.&quot; </blockquote>\n<p>Has Trump possibly filled the hole in Graham's heart left by the death of John McCain? Susan Collins, who is always <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/remember-that-time-susan-collins-said-brett-kavanaugh-wouldnt-be-a-threat-to-reproductive-rights\">wrong,</a> said McCain was like a &quot;father figure&quot; to Graham, but he describes McCain more like an &quot;older brother&quot; or &quot;commanding officer.&quot; Regardless, it was simply a &quot;collaboration&quot; or a &quot;political marriage&quot; and what he has with Trump is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCtDAAPO-j4\">for real.</a></p>\n<blockquote> &quot;I personally like [Trump]. We play golf. He's very nice to me.&quot; </blockquote>\n<p>During the 2016 campaign, Trump gave out Graham's personal cell phone number. He also <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/trump-lindsay-graham-insults-219374\">called</a> Graham a &quot;disgrace&quot; -- while campaigning in his home state -- and said he was &quot;one of the worst representatives of any representative in the United States.&quot; But it's important to note that he wasn't president then. Graham didn't even vote for Trump: &quot;I voted for Evan &mdash; whatever the guy's name is.&quot; (It's Evan McMullin, and we voted for Hillary!) Now that Trump colluded his way into the White House, Graham wants in his considerable &quot;orbit,&quot; and he's willing to do just about anything to maintain favored status.</p>\n<p>When asked if he &quot;trusts&quot; Trump, Graham responded like he was talking about a common mobster: &quot;I trust the president to want to be successful.&quot; Wow! We all feel much better now. He even keeps moving the goal posts on Trump's involvement with Russia.</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;I told the president that if you colluded with the Russians, if your campaign sat down and worked with foreign intelligence operatives to manipulate the results of the election, that'd be the end of us, &quot; Graham said.</blockquote>\n<p>That's quite a profile in courage: &quot;If conclusively proven that you've committed multiple crimes and thus impeachment is inevitable and you're now useless to me, then well, that's the end of this relationship. I don't care how good a golfer you are.&quot;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Graham will stay as close as possible to the president.</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;Relevance,&quot; Graham said, returning to the word as if it were a mantra. &quot;That was John McCain's word.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>If McCain were alive today, we think his word would've been &quot;barf.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Follow Stephen Robinson on </em><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SER1897\">Twitter.</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Yr Wonkette is supported by reader donations.

                "text": "People have expressed concern that Lindsey Graham's shameless about-face regarding Donald Trump is due to Russian influence or what's known as \"kompromat.\" That's not a Russian salad dressing but compromising material about someone. However, this theory requires that Graham is a character from a Shakespearean tragedy rather than your garden variety sell-out puppet job who is desperate for attention.\nDuring an interview with the New York Times, Graham admitted that his primary objective is to remain \"relevant.\" That feels more like a quote from a mid-'90s Madonna interview than one with a US senator. Madonna never lowered her dignity to perform with Courtney Love, even at the height of grunge. Graham has had no problem becoming bosom buddies with Trump, a man he once described as a \"race-baiting, xenophobic religious bigot.\"\nPolitics, [Graham] explained, was the art of what works and what brings desired outcomes. \"I've got an opportunity up here working with the president to get some really good outcomes for the country,\" he told me.\nGraham is senator of our home state so we can appreciate his focus on \"outcomes.\" South Carolina could use some infrastructure, maybe some schools. Tell us more about these \"really good outcomes,\" Lindsey.\nAn outcome of particular interest to Graham, at the moment, is getting re-elected to a fourth Senate term in South Carolina, where Trump owns commanding approval numbers, especially among the hard-core Republicans who in the past questioned Graham's devotion to their conservative cause.\nWait, hold up: Graham's trying to stay \"relevant\" so he can work with Individual 1 to further his larger goal of ... keeping his job. That's it? There has to be more to serving in the Senate than just getting re-elected.\n\"If you don't want to get re-elected, you're in the wrong business,\" he said.\nSupporting Trump can certainly help Graham get re-elected in South Carolina. Over the past year, Graham's approval rating among Republicans has increased from 51 percent to 72 percent. That's enough to hold off any primary challenge in 2020. All he had to do was cozy up to Trump and personally attack Democrats while defending Brett Kavanaugh from accountability. This might've permanently damaged his working relationship with Democrat Chris Coons, a longtime colleague, but who cares? His new bestie is the president of the freaking United States!\n\"I have never been called this much by a president in my life,\" [Graham said.] His tone reflected a mixture of amazement and amusement, with perhaps a dash of awe. \"It's weird, and it's flattering, and it creates some opportunity. It also creates some pressure.\"\nHas Trump possibly filled the hole in Graham's heart left by the death of John McCain? Susan Collins, who is always wrong, said McCain was like a \"father figure\" to Graham, but he describes McCain more like an \"older brother\" or \"commanding officer.\" Regardless, it was simply a \"collaboration\" or a \"political marriage\" and what he has with Trump is for real.\n\"I personally like [Trump]. We play golf. He's very nice to me.\"\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump gave out Graham's personal cell phone number. He also called Graham a \"disgrace\" -- while campaigning in his home state -- and said he was \"one of the worst representatives of any representative in the United States.\" But it's important to note that he wasn't president then. Graham didn't even vote for Trump: \"I voted for Evan \u2014 whatever the guy's name is.\" (It's Evan McMullin, and we voted for Hillary!) Now that Trump colluded his way into the White House, Graham wants in his considerable \"orbit,\" and he's willing to do just about anything to maintain favored status.\nWhen asked if he \"trusts\" Trump, Graham responded like he was talking about a common mobster: \"I trust the president to want to be successful.\" Wow! We all feel much better now. He even keeps moving the goal posts on Trump's involvement with Russia.\n\"I told the president that if you colluded with the Russians, if your campaign sat down and worked with foreign intelligence operatives to manipulate the results of the election, that'd be the end of us, \" Graham said.\nThat's quite a profile in courage: \"If conclusively proven that you've committed multiple crimes and thus impeachment is inevitable and you're now useless to me, then well, that's the end of this relationship. I don't care how good a golfer you are.\"\nIn the meantime, Graham will stay as close as possible to the president.\n\"Relevance,\" Graham said, returning to the word as if it were a mantra. \"That was John McCain's word.\"\nIf McCain were alive today, we think his word would've been \"barf.\"\nFollow Stephen Robinson on Twitter.\nYr Wonkette is supported by reader donations.

It is on Thursday! We are all anticipating the release of whatever Sharpied bullshit version of the Mueller report Attorney General Bill Barr has decided deletes <em>just enough</em> Trump crimes -- both the obstruction kind and the kind that involves bad behavior with the Russians that for whatever reason Robert Mueller decided he couldn't prove rose to the level of a grand conspiracy. (And we will be live-blogging the release! That's right, we are going to liveblog NOTHINGNESS.)</p>\n<p>And as the week goes on, we are starting to hear just how freaked out everybody in TrumpLand is, because they know that even 400 pages of fully redacted ink will make them look <em>super</em> fucking bad. (Especially 400 pages of fully redacted ink, actually.) Trump <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-unleashes-inferno-tweets-clock-counts-down-mueller-report\">has been on the Twitter</a> stepping on rakes like he always does, live-tweeting his fear and lamentations for days now. We got news this weekend that the White House <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/white-house-lawyers-what-cant-they-do\">is particularly freaked</a> about what former White House counsel Don McGahn, who spent at least 30 hours with the special counsel, told Mueller's team.</p>\n<p>And now there is <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-officials-concerned-about-being-exposed-mueller-report-n994861\">NBC News</a> to tell us that also the rest of the whole entire White House is losing its shit, and also large hordes of people who <em>used</em> to work at the White House, because a lot of them cooperated (the pre-Giuliani lawyers told them to!), and they just know they are going to get in big trouble if their names show up in that report, because of how they talked a lot of shit about President Crime Boss to Mueller's team!</p>\n<blockquote>Some of the officials and their lawyers have sought clarity from the Justice Department on whether the names of those who cooperated with Mueller's team will be redacted or if the public report will be written in a way that makes it obvious who shared certain details of Trump's actions that were part of the obstruction of justice probe, people familiar with the discussions said. But, they said, the Justice Department has refused to elaborate.</blockquote>\n<p>Poor babies! And here we were pretty sure Bill Barr had sent copies over to the White House for folks to cross out stuff as they wished.</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;They got asked questions and told the truth and now they're worried the wrath will follow,&quot; one former White House official said.</blockquote>\n<p>Because they know what a shithole person they work/ed for and they were up close and personal with Trump while he was committing all the obstruction of justice crimes, and they spilled the beans? Because they've seen how he treats human beings who aren't currently in Dear Leader's good graces? Yeah, we guess that would make a bad American human being who has freely chosen to work for the most criminal White House in history nervous.</p>\n<p>How bad is it?</p>\n<blockquote>One person close to the White House said there is &quot;breakdown-level anxiety&quot; among some current and former staffers who cooperated with the investigation at the direction of Trump's legal team at the time.</blockquote>\n<p>Hahahahahahahahahahaha, oh man, we are trying to feel sorry for these people right now, but we aren't trying very hard.</p>\n<p>We just wonder if they felt this way when Donald Trump was attacking James Comey and Jeff Sessions and Peter Strzok and Lisa Page and Bruce Ohr and Andrew McCabe and approximately one million other people, in his very obvious campaign to obstruct the investigations into him. They probably at least <em>remember</em> all that stuff, which is why they are selfishly worried the guy many of them continue to work for (of their own volition) is going to turn on them next.</p>\n<p>&quot;First he came for the Deep State, but I was not a Shillary for Hillary, I was much more of a Shallow State type, so I stayed silent. When he finally came for me, nobody was left to speak up for me, because BOY HOWDY I am an unsympathetic piece of shit character in this story.&quot; When this shitshow period of American history is turned into a musical, that would be a good line for a Trump White House person to say.</p>\n<p>Today, when you say your thoughts 'n' prayers, try to take a moment to remember these poor souls. Or, you know, fuck that, and just rejoice in their misery.</p>\n<p>TICK TOCK UNTIL THURSDAY, ASSHOLES.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-officials-concerned-about-being-exposed-mueller-report-n994861\">NBC News</a>]</p>\n<p><em><strong>Wonkette is ad-free and funded ONLY by YOU, our dear readers.

                "text": "THE DAY OF THE BIGGEST COVER-UP OF ALL IS NIGH! It is on Thursday! We are all anticipating the release of whatever Sharpied bullshit version of the Mueller report Attorney General Bill Barr has decided deletes just enough Trump crimes -- both the obstruction kind and the kind that involves bad behavior with the Russians that for whatever reason Robert Mueller decided he couldn't prove rose to the level of a grand conspiracy. (And we will be live-blogging the release! That's right, we are going to liveblog NOTHINGNESS.)\nAnd as the week goes on, we are starting to hear just how freaked out everybody in TrumpLand is, because they know that even 400 pages of fully redacted ink will make them look super fucking bad. (Especially 400 pages of fully redacted ink, actually.) Trump has been on the Twitter stepping on rakes like he always does, live-tweeting his fear and lamentations for days now. We got news this weekend that the White House is particularly freaked about what former White House counsel Don McGahn, who spent at least 30 hours with the special counsel, told Mueller's team.\nAnd now there is NBC News to tell us that also the rest of the whole entire White House is losing its shit, and also large hordes of people who used to work at the White House, because a lot of them cooperated (the pre-Giuliani lawyers told them to!), and they just know they are going to get in big trouble if their names show up in that report, because of how they talked a lot of shit about President Crime Boss to Mueller's team!\nSome of the officials and their lawyers have sought clarity from the Justice Department on whether the names of those who cooperated with Mueller's team will be redacted or if the public report will be written in a way that makes it obvious who shared certain details of Trump's actions that were part of the obstruction of justice probe, people familiar with the discussions said. But, they said, the Justice Department has refused to elaborate.\nPoor babies! And here we were pretty sure Bill Barr had sent copies over to the White House for folks to cross out stuff as they wished.\n\"They got asked questions and told the truth and now they're worried the wrath will follow,\" one former White House official said.\nBecause they know what a shithole person they work/ed for and they were up close and personal with Trump while he was committing all the obstruction of justice crimes, and they spilled the beans? Because they've seen how he treats human beings who aren't currently in Dear Leader's good graces? Yeah, we guess that would make a bad American human being who has freely chosen to work for the most criminal White House in history nervous.\nHow bad is it?\nOne person close to the White House said there is \"breakdown-level anxiety\" among some current and former staffers who cooperated with the investigation at the direction of Trump's legal team at the time.\nHahahahahahahahahahaha, oh man, we are trying to feel sorry for these people right now, but we aren't trying very hard.\nWe just wonder if they felt this way when Donald Trump was attacking James Comey and Jeff Sessions and Peter Strzok and Lisa Page and Bruce Ohr and Andrew McCabe and approximately one million other people, in his very obvious campaign to obstruct the investigations into him. They probably at least remember all that stuff, which is why they are selfishly worried the guy many of them continue to work for (of their own volition) is going to turn on them next.\n\"First he came for the Deep State, but I was not a Shillary for Hillary, I was much more of a Shallow State type, so I stayed silent. When he finally came for me, nobody was left to speak up for me, because BOY HOWDY I am an unsympathetic piece of shit character in this story.\" When this shitshow period of American history is turned into a musical, that would be a good line for a Trump White House person to say.\nToday, when you say your thoughts 'n' prayers, try to take a moment to remember these poor souls. Or, you know, fuck that, and just rejoice in their misery.\nTICK TOCK UNTIL THURSDAY, ASSHOLES.\n[NBC News]\nWonkette is ad-free and funded ONLY by YOU, our dear readers.

                "html": "<p>If you are a man or a lady <em>of letters</em>, and are also versed in all internet traditions, you are likely aware of the famous satirical online web essay <a href=\"https://www.theonion.com/why-do-all-these-homosexuals-keep-sucking-my-cock-1819584210\">&quot;Why Do All These Homosexuals Keep Sucking My Cock?&quot;</a> It's a monologue from The Onion, in the voice of a man who is just really fine with gay guys, he's just fine, but he's not gay, which leads to the conundrum in question. It's just that &quot;wherever [he goes] these days&quot; -- locker rooms, cruising spots in the woods -- he'd be just shooting the breeze, and before he knew it, a homosexual was sucking his cock! The narrator ends by saying that he really doesn't want to do this, but if it keeps happening, he's going to have to teach those homosexuals a lesson by fuckin' them right in their gay butt!</p>\n<p>We wanted that great work of internet to be on your mind as you watch this video of Tucker Carlson talking about Pete Buttigieg last night. The words in all caps below the video are the actual words he said, and the clip is only eight seconds long, but luckily, it's looped, so that you may watch it for the rest of your natural life, if you so choose:</p>\n<p>THEY WANT TO CONSUME HIM LIKE A HEARTY STEW.</p>\n<p>EVERY LAST DROP OF BUTTIGIEG.</p>\n<p>YUM.</p>\n<p>THEY'RE ALL IN.</p>\n<p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez apparently has the day off from <a href=\"https://www.theonion.com/tucker-carlson-challenges-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-to-a-1833754126\">living rent-free</a> in Tucker Carlson's disturbing psychosexual fantasies, and the role will be played by her understudy Pete Buttigieg dressed up for Halloween as a can of Slutty Dinty Moore Beef Stew.</p>\n<p>We don't know the rest of Tucker Carlson's monologue, but unless he prefaced those comments by saying, &quot;I am about to do a very weird impression of an unfucked dork who desires to drown in a steaming hot bowl of Pete Buttigieg's meat bits,&quot; we doubt it's necessary. (Aw dammit, we <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/439257-tucker-carlson-media-left-orourke-for-younger-hotter-candidate-in-buttigieg\">Googled it.</a> It was a monologue about the Democrats leaving Beto O'Rourke's milkshake in the yard and maniacally eating Pete Buttigieg like a hearty stew, a reference that came from MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace calling Buttigieg &quot;Chicken Soup For My Soul,&quot; which you'd think Carlson would know is a reference to an extremely famous line of Christian books. But we guess Carlson doesn't know that, because when he said &quot;every last drop,&quot; he tensed up and shook his head back and forth in the universal sign of &quot;MM MM, GOOD! ALSO I HAVE AN INAPPROPRIATE BONER RIGHT NOW!&quot;)</p>\n<p>We are too daft to understand Fox News jokes, obviously, but Tucker Carlson is <em>apparently</em> making fun of Democrats' newfound love for Pete Buttigieg. And if he has to wear his best &quot;fuck me&quot; face while he begs for permission to slurp up 20 bowls of Pete's special sauce just to own the libs and show Dems HOW RIDICULOUS THEY ARE, he'll do it <em>with abandon</em>.</p>\n<p>Um, yeah, so, as we have discussed in the past, Tucker Carlson has issues. He has <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/tucker-carlson-does-not-care-for-isis-jokes-would-prefer-mocking-the-transgenders\">extremely weird stories</a> about gay men, where he brags about beating them up in the bathroom, because apparently they all looked at him funny. Indeed, in that story, he <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2007/08/tuckers-traumatic-bathroom-experience-steve-clemons/225764/\">bragged about</a> a gay man coming on to him and him<em> being so mad he went back with a buddy to beat the shit out of the guy</em>. One time he got really mad because &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; made fun of ISIS, because know what Tucker Carlson would like to see? An &quot;SNL&quot; sketch about transgender bathrooms! Ha! Ha ha!</p>\n<p>Recently, he had a weird moment when he <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/tucker-carlson-knows-who-has-a-penis-cookies-have-a-very-good-penis\">started talking about</a> &quot;spiritual neutering,&quot; in the context of gingerbread cookies in Scotland that did not have defined man cock genital areas. Because it's just not Christmas until you bite that gingerbread cock off in your mouth, is it, Tuck?</p>\n<p>There is something wrong with Tucker Swanson McNear Carlson, that is what we are saying.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Follow Evan Hurst on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/evanhurst\">RIGHT HERE, DO IT RIGHT HERE!</a></strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Wonkette is ad-free and funded ONLY by YOU, our dear readers.

It's just that \"wherever [he goes] these days\" -- locker rooms, cruising spots in the woods -- he'd be just shooting the breeze, and before he knew it, a homosexual was sucking his cock! The narrator ends by saying that he really doesn't want to do this, but if it keeps happening, he's going to have to teach those homosexuals a lesson by fuckin' them right in their gay butt!\nWe wanted that great work of internet to be on your mind as you watch this video of Tucker Carlson talking about Pete Buttigieg last night. The words in all caps below the video are the actual words he said, and the clip is only eight seconds long, but luckily, it's looped, so that you may watch it for the rest of your natural life, if you so choose:\nTHEY WANT TO CONSUME HIM LIKE A HEARTY STEW.\nEVERY LAST DROP OF BUTTIGIEG.\nYUM.\nTHEY'RE ALL IN.\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez apparently has the day off from living rent-free in Tucker Carlson's disturbing psychosexual fantasies, and the role will be played by her understudy Pete Buttigieg dressed up for Halloween as a can of Slutty Dinty Moore Beef Stew.\nWe don't know the rest of Tucker Carlson's monologue, but unless he prefaced those comments by saying, \"I am about to do a very weird impression of an unfucked dork who desires to drown in a steaming hot bowl of Pete Buttigieg's meat bits,\" we doubt it's necessary. (Aw dammit, we Googled it. It was a monologue about the Democrats leaving Beto O'Rourke's milkshake in the yard and maniacally eating Pete Buttigieg like a hearty stew, a reference that came from MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace calling Buttigieg \"Chicken Soup For My Soul,\" which you'd think Carlson would know is a reference to an extremely famous line of Christian books. But we guess Carlson doesn't know that, because when he said \"every last drop,\" he tensed up and shook his head back and forth in the universal sign of \"MM MM, GOOD! ALSO I HAVE AN INAPPROPRIATE BONER RIGHT NOW!\")\nWe are too daft to understand Fox News jokes, obviously, but Tucker Carlson is apparently making fun of Democrats' newfound love for Pete Buttigieg. And if he has to wear his best \"fuck me\" face while he begs for permission to slurp up 20 bowls of Pete's special sauce just to own the libs and show Dems HOW RIDICULOUS THEY ARE, he'll do it with abandon.\nUm, yeah, so, as we have discussed in the past, Tucker Carlson has issues. He has extremely weird stories about gay men, where he brags about beating them up in the bathroom, because apparently they all looked at him funny. Indeed, in that story, he bragged about a gay man coming on to him and him being so mad he went back with a buddy to beat the shit out of the guy. One time he got really mad because \"Saturday Night Live\" made fun of ISIS, because know what Tucker Carlson would like to see? An \"SNL\" sketch about transgender bathrooms! Ha! Ha ha!\nRecently, he had a weird moment when he started talking about \"spiritual neutering,\" in the context of gingerbread cookies in Scotland that did not have defined man cock genital areas. Because it's just not Christmas until you bite that gingerbread cock off in your mouth, is it, Tuck?\nThere is something wrong with Tucker Swanson McNear Carlson, that is what we are saying.\nFollow Evan Hurst on Twitter RIGHT HERE, DO IT RIGHT HERE!\nWonkette is ad-free and funded ONLY by YOU, our dear readers.

                "html": "<p>Attorney General William Barr would like to remind you that <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/hey-bill-barr-what-in-the-entire-f-ck-are-we-waiting-for-right-now\">fuxxoring the Mueller report</a> isn't his only duty as AG, even if that does remain his first love. Yesterday, Barr <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/eoir/file/1154747/download\">issued an order </a>telling immigration courts that certain classes of people seeking asylum in the USA have to be kept locked up until their asylum cases are decided, and therefore cannot apply for release on bond. Does the Executive Branch have that power? You bet your due-process-loving ass it acts like it does, because the immigration courts are run by the Department of &quot;Justice,&quot; not the judicial branch. Whether Barr's ruling is constitutional is another matter, and the American Civil Liberties Union is <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-comment-attorney-general-action-against-asylum-seekers\">gearing up</a> to challenge the ruling in court as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>We'll let the <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/barr-asylum-bail.html\">'splainer</a> how Barr's order attempts to remake a huge part of immigration law so that some asylum seekers can be jailed forever:</p>\n<blockquote>For more than a decade, migrants who are deemed to have a &quot;credible fear&quot; of persecution in their home countries have been allowed to request a bond hearing so they can be released on bail while they wait for their asylum cases to be heard, sometimes months or years later [...]<br><br>But Mr. Barr's order came in a case involving an Indian man who crossed into the United States from Mexico and claimed asylum. Mr. Barr, exercising his authority as the top official overseeing the immigration courts, said that migrants in similar cases do not have the right to bail.<br><br>Such an immigrant, &quot;after establishing a credible fear of persecution or torture, is ineligible for release on bond,&quot; Mr. Barr wrote in his order, which overrules a previous Board of Immigration Appeals case from 2005.</blockquote>\n<p>The upshot is that thousands of people <em>fleeing persecution or torture</em> will now be treated to months or years in detention with almost no hope of being released unless they're granted parole by the Department of Homeland Security (which has sharply reduced parole under Donald Trump). Since the order is likely to add even more people to an already over-capacity system of ICE detention facilities, Barr generously delayed the order's effective date to allow DHS to find more spots in which to pack people who have committed the crime of wanting not to be killed in their home countries. Good time to buy more stock in private prisons!</p>\n<p>The order would not apply to families with minor children or to unaccompanied minors, because despite <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/trump-wants-family-separation-2-0-and-he-wants-it-now\">Trump's complaints</a> about our stupid laws and judges, children under 18 <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/us-government-to-rid-itself-of-meddlesome-judge-in-baby-jails-case\">can't be held for more than 20 days.</a> Supposedly.</p>\n<p>Barr's ruling is based in the same quirk of immigration law former AG Jeff Sessions exploited in his attempt last June to force immigration judges to <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/no-asylum-for-those-fleeing-domestic-violence-or-gangs-because-were-literally-in-hell-now\">reject asylum claims</a> from people fearing domestic abuse or gang violence in their home countries. Since immigration courts are<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/19/18148610/immigration-asylum-domestic-gang-violence-trump\"> actually part of the executive branch,</a> not the judiciary, the AG has the power to unilaterally decide whether previous immigration cases were decided lawfully, as if the AG were a little bitty Supreme Court of Immigration.</p>\n<p>That power isn't absolute, though, since federal courts still have ultimate jurisdiction when it comes to whether the AG's immigration decisions are lawful. In December, a federal court <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/Since%20immigration%20courts%20are%20actually%20part%20of%20the%20executive%20branch,%20not%20the%20judiciary,%20the%20AG%20has%20the%20power%20to%20unilaterally%20decide%20whether%20previous%20immigration%20cases%20were%20decided%20lawfully,%20as%20if%20the%20AG%20were%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20immigration.\">threw out most of the new rules</a> Sessions imposed, ruling Sessions had ignored the intent of Congress.</p>\n<p>In response to Barr's ruling yesterday, Omar Jadawat, the director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-comment-attorney-general-action-against-asylum-seekers\">promised a lawsuit</a> on constitutional grounds, because due process is still a thing:</p>\n<blockquote>This is the Trump administration's latest assault on people fleeing persecution and seeking refuge in the United States. Our Constitution does not allow the government to lock up asylum seekers without basic due process. We'll see the administration in court.</blockquote>\n<p>Even before Barr issued his ruling, a federal judge in Seattle <a href=\"http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/apr/05/us-judge-orders-quicker-bond-hearings-for-asylum-s/\">ruled</a> earlier this month that asylum seekers have a right to request release on bond. Judge Marsha Pechman ordered immigration courts to conduct bond hearings within seven days of a request, and &quot;said it's up to the U.S. government to prove why the immigrants shouldn't be released.&quot; That ruling came in a case over the slow pace of bond hearings for asylum seekers, so it's not clear how it may bump up against Barr's attempt to restrict the right to bond altogether -- Yr Dok Zoom is not a lawyer, but we would guess federal courts might be awfully skeptical of any attempt to restrict a fairly common legal right, no?</p>\n<p>Needless to say, if Barr's rule is eventually overturned, look for Donald Trump to tell immigration judges <a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/donald-trump-sanctuary-cities\">he'll pardon them</a> if they deny bail anyway.</p>\n<p>Yr Wonkette is supported by reader donations.

                "text": "Attorney General William Barr would like to remind you that fuxxoring the Mueller report isn't his only duty as AG, even if that does remain his first love. Yesterday, Barr issued an order telling immigration courts that certain classes of people seeking asylum in the USA have to be kept locked up until their asylum cases are decided, and therefore cannot apply for release on bond. Does the Executive Branch have that power? You bet your due-process-loving ass it acts like it does, because the immigration courts are run by the Department of \"Justice,\" not the judicial branch. Whether Barr's ruling is constitutional is another matter, and the American Civil Liberties Union is gearing up to challenge the ruling in court as soon as possible.\nWe'll let the New York Times 'splainer how Barr's order attempts to remake a huge part of immigration law so that some asylum seekers can be jailed forever:\nFor more than a decade, migrants who are deemed to have a \"credible fear\" of persecution in their home countries have been allowed to request a bond hearing so they can be released on bail while they wait for their asylum cases to be heard, sometimes months or years later [...]\nBut Mr. Barr's order came in a case involving an Indian man who crossed into the United States from Mexico and claimed asylum. Mr. Barr, exercising his authority as the top official overseeing the immigration courts, said that migrants in similar cases do not have the right to bail.\nSuch an immigrant, \"after establishing a credible fear of persecution or torture, is ineligible for release on bond,\" Mr. Barr wrote in his order, which overrules a previous Board of Immigration Appeals case from 2005.\nThe upshot is that thousands of people fleeing persecution or torture will now be treated to months or years in detention with almost no hope of being released unless they're granted parole by the Department of Homeland Security (which has sharply reduced parole under Donald Trump). Since the order is likely to add even more people to an already over-capacity system of ICE detention facilities, Barr generously delayed the order's effective date to allow DHS to find more spots in which to pack people who have committed the crime of wanting not to be killed in their home countries. Good time to buy more stock in private prisons!\nThe order would not apply to families with minor children or to unaccompanied minors, because despite Trump's complaints about our stupid laws and judges, children under 18 can't be held for more than 20 days. Supposedly.\nBarr's ruling is based in the same quirk of immigration law former AG Jeff Sessions exploited in his attempt last June to force immigration judges to reject asylum claims from people fearing domestic abuse or gang violence in their home countries. Since immigration courts are actually part of the executive branch, not the judiciary, the AG has the power to unilaterally decide whether previous immigration cases were decided lawfully, as if the AG were a little bitty Supreme Court of Immigration.\nThat power isn't absolute, though, since federal courts still have ultimate jurisdiction when it comes to whether the AG's immigration decisions are lawful. In December, a federal court threw out most of the new rules Sessions imposed, ruling Sessions had ignored the intent of Congress.\nIn response to Barr's ruling yesterday, Omar Jadawat, the director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, promised a lawsuit on constitutional grounds, because due process is still a thing:\nThis is the Trump administration's latest assault on people fleeing persecution and seeking refuge in the United States. Our Constitution does not allow the government to lock up asylum seekers without basic due process. We'll see the administration in court.\nEven before Barr issued his ruling, a federal judge in Seattle ruled earlier this month that asylum seekers have a right to request release on bond. Judge Marsha Pechman ordered immigration courts to conduct bond hearings within seven days of a request, and \"said it's up to the U.S. government to prove why the immigrants shouldn't be released.\" That ruling came in a case over the slow pace of bond hearings for asylum seekers, so it's not clear how it may bump up against Barr's attempt to restrict the right to bond altogether -- Yr Dok Zoom is not a lawyer, but we would guess federal courts might be awfully skeptical of any attempt to restrict a fairly common legal right, no?\nNeedless to say, if Barr's rule is eventually overturned, look for Donald Trump to tell immigration judges he'll pardon them if they deny bail anyway.\nYr Wonkette is supported by reader donations.
