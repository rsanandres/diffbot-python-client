Perhaps you got the same chain email I did: did you know over 50 individuals connected to President Bill Clinton have died in mysterious circumstances?</p>\n<p>The conspiracy relied on a combination of innuendo and statistical ignorance. Most of the &quot;Clinton connections&quot; are <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/clinton-body-bags/\">simply fabricated</a>: a cashier killed by a robber was actually an &quot;accountant for the CIA.&quot; The dozen or so deaths remaining seems high, but tens of thousands of people are vaguely &quot;connected&quot; to a president: Four Marines who were killed in a helicopter crash were listed because Clinton was on the helicopter two months earlier.</p>\n<p>A new, woke version of the body count conspiracy has cropped up in liberal circles, with mysterious government assassins targeting protesters of the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.</p>\n<p>David Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.</p>\n<p>Sign up here and stay informed!</p>\n<p>&quot;Puzzling number of men tied to Ferguson protests have died,&quot; reads <a href=\"https://www.kmov.com/news/puzzling-number-of-men-tied-to-ferguson-protests-have-died/article_437d2e17-2dad-5742-8820-f803d7c8d680.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\">the Monday headline</a> from the Associated Press. Other outlets have expanded on this innuendo: &quot;<a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/deaths-of-six-men-tied-to-ferguson-protests-prompt-fear-of-sinister-connection\">Deaths Of Six Men Tied To Ferguson Protests Prompt Fear Of Sinister Connection</a>&quot;; &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/puzzling-number-men-tied-ferguson-protests-have-died-n984261\">Deaths of six men tied to Ferguson protests alarm activists</a>&quot;; &quot;<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/puzzling-number-of-men-tied-to-ferguson-protests-have-died\">Deaths of Ferguson activists lead some to believe something sinister is at play</a>.&quot;</p>\n<p>Despite its &quot;puzzlement,&quot; the AP cites police statements noting most of the deaths weren't murders and also the crime rate and lack of mental health resources available to black Ferguson residents. But the AP also takes a bizarre &quot;both sides&quot; approach to the issue, quoting activists insisting there is something sinister going on, perpetrated by shadowy &quot;white supremacists or police sympathizers.&quot; The deaths are listed out one by one, often with clarifying details omitted.</p>\n<p>The result of the framing is the far left cited the AP story on social media as vindication for the conspiracy.</p>\n<blockquote> <p>News service the AP finally covered the horrific story of the Black liberation activists who have &quot;mysteriously&quot; died in what looks an awful lot like assassinations, with this euphemistic headline:<br> Puzzling number of men tied to Ferguson protests have died<a href=\"https://t.co/TDF8tWo1jc\">https://t.co/TDF8tWo1jc</a></p> <p>&mdash; Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton/status/1107709731588714496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p>When lots of activists suspiciously die in adversary countries, the US press doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to conclude it&rsquo;s assassinations by the evil government authorities.

The 20-year-old was shot in the head before the car was torched,&quot; the AP reports. What they omit is that Joshua's family say he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/us/another-killing-in-ferguson-leaves-a-family-grappling-with-the-unknown.html\">never joined the protests</a>. His inclusion in the list likely stems from <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/a-murdered-witness/\">viral rumors</a> at the time that he was killed after testifying in the Michael Brown case, another claim his family denied.</p>\n<p>&quot;MarShawn McCarrel of Columbus, Ohio, shot himself in February 2016 outside the front door of the Ohio Statehouse, police said. He had been active in Ferguson,&quot; the AP writes. McCarrel was a member of the Ohio branch of Black Lives Matter, but he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brownblaze/status/1107719544569683969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">never actually participated</a> in the Ferguson protests. If an out-of-state activist is counted as &quot;tied to Ferguson,&quot; then the pool of those &quot;tied to Ferguson&quot; is likely hundreds of thousands, so large that six deaths is a drop in the bucket.</p>\n<p>AP reports that &quot;24-year-old Danye Jones was found hanging from a tree in the yard of his north St. Louis County home.&quot; However, as they note, it was his <em>mother</em> who was active in Ferguson, not him. She insists her son's death was a lynching, but <a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/claim-of-a-st-louis-county-lynching-goes-viral-on/article_4554688c-c9d1-5861-9094-de07b3922ced.html\">police say</a> there was no sign of a struggle and the family themselves reported it to police as a suicide.</p>\n<p>This leaves us with only three deaths of actual Ferguson protesters. Yes, &quot;Edward Crawford Jr., 27, fatally shot himself in May 2017 after telling acquaintances he had been distraught over personal issues,&quot; but AP omits that he did so in front of <a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/protester-featured-in-iconic-ferguson-photo-found-dead-of-self/article_072602fb-99f1-531f-aa1c-b971e8b32566.html\">two witnesses</a>. Bassem Masri was found dead of a fentanyl overdose on public transportation; AP omits he was open about his history of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bassem_masri/status/767837503403339776\">heroin addiction</a>.</p>\n<p>Darren Seals was killed in the same manner as Deandre Joshua, likely prompting the conspiracy theories in the first place. But a <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/darren-seals-isnt-the-only-ferguson-man-to-be-shot-and-torched-in-a-car\">Daily Beast investigation</a> found four other men in the Ferguson area were also found shot in cars that were set on fire, with three killings confirmed to be carried out by locals. It seems to be a common MO in the area to burn cars to destroy forensic evidence.</p>\n<p>Seals also sadly fits the profile of the sort of man who might find himself caught up in violent crime. &quot;Caught my first felony at the age of 18 for slamming a cop on his head. Was shot 7 times and had a smile on my face the whole time,&quot; he wrote in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/09/07/who-killed-ferguson-activist-darren-seals/?utm_term=.12babfc90301\">a Facebook post</a>. Those seven bullets were the second time he had been shot; his murder was the third. Even within the Ferguson protest movement he was a divisive figure, once physically attacking fellow activist DeRay McKesson in a parking lot.</p>\n<p>The &quot;Ferguson body count&quot; is only plausible if you exclude all exculpatory evidence, insist every police statement is a lie, and failed high school statistics. It's distressing to see activists pushing such a deranged conspiracy theory, but it's even sadder to see media outlets fanning the flames.</p>\n<p>Alex is a staff writer at the Washington Free Beacon.

                "text": "During the 1990s and early 2000s, the \"Clinton body count\" conspiracy was all the rage. Perhaps you got the same chain email I did: did you know over 50 individuals connected to President Bill Clinton have died in mysterious circumstances?\nThe conspiracy relied on a combination of innuendo and statistical ignorance. Most of the \"Clinton connections\" are simply fabricated: a cashier killed by a robber was actually an \"accountant for the CIA.\" The dozen or so deaths remaining seems high, but tens of thousands of people are vaguely \"connected\" to a president: Four Marines who were killed in a helicopter crash were listed because Clinton was on the helicopter two months earlier.\nA new, woke version of the body count conspiracy has cropped up in liberal circles, with mysterious government assassins targeting protesters of the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.\nDavid Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.\nSign up here and stay informed!\n\"Puzzling number of men tied to Ferguson protests have died,\" reads the Monday headline from the Associated Press. Other outlets have expanded on this innuendo: \"Deaths Of Six Men Tied To Ferguson Protests Prompt Fear Of Sinister Connection\"; \"Deaths of six men tied to Ferguson protests alarm activists\"; \"Deaths of Ferguson activists lead some to believe something sinister is at play.\"\nDespite its \"puzzlement,\" the AP cites police statements noting most of the deaths weren't murders and also the crime rate and lack of mental health resources available to black Ferguson residents. But the AP also takes a bizarre \"both sides\" approach to the issue, quoting activists insisting there is something sinister going on, perpetrated by shadowy \"white supremacists or police sympathizers.\" The deaths are listed out one by one, often with clarifying details omitted.\nThe result of the framing is the far left cited the AP story on social media as vindication for the conspiracy.\nNews service the AP finally covered the horrific story of the Black liberation activists who have \"mysteriously\" died in what looks an awful lot like assassinations, with this euphemistic headline:\nPuzzling number of men tied to Ferguson protests have diedhttps://t.co/TDF8tWo1jc\n\u2014 Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) March 18, 2019\nWhen lots of activists suspiciously die in adversary countries, the US press doesn\u2019t hesitate to conclude it\u2019s assassinations by the evil government authorities. They don\u2019t dare entertain that idea in the US. In Ferguson it\u2019s just \"puzzling\" https://t.co/FfhhNgsuzi\n\u2014 Rania Khalek (@RaniaKhalek) March 18, 2019\nSix.\nDo you remember when this was 1? Then 2? Last year I shared when it got to 4.\nAnd now it\u2019s 6.\nSIX.\nhttps://t.co/ya4lJQD6XV\n\u2014 Kelly Wickham Hurst (@mochamomma) March 18, 2019\nNot a damn thing.\nPredictable, yes. Puzzling, no.\n\u2014 Kelly Wickham Hurst (@mochamomma) March 18, 2019\nI'll just say it- Ferguson protesters are being murdered extrajudicially by the State.\nThere's nothing puzzling about it.\nThe US is a fascist country- and we should treat it like it is. https://t.co/rrJMxYAyT8\n\u2014 \uff2d \u262d free chelsea! (@AudaciousBeat) March 18, 2019\nI think this is an Occam's Razor situation guyshttps://t.co/B8Z1C8qTb5\n\u2014 Eoin Higgins (@EoinHiggins_) March 18, 2019\nAs with the Clinton conspiracies, the \"Ferguson body count\" is less scary when considering that thousands participated in the 2014 protests, the deaths took place over a span of five years, and that some of the dead men's connections to the protests are dubious.\n\"Deandre Joshua's body was found inside a burned car blocks from the protest. The 20-year-old was shot in the head before the car was torched,\" the AP reports. What they omit is that Joshua's family say he never joined the protests. His inclusion in the list likely stems from viral rumors at the time that he was killed after testifying in the Michael Brown case, another claim his family denied.\n\"MarShawn McCarrel of Columbus, Ohio, shot himself in February 2016 outside the front door of the Ohio Statehouse, police said. He had been active in Ferguson,\" the AP writes. McCarrel was a member of the Ohio branch of Black Lives Matter, but he never actually participated in the Ferguson protests. If an out-of-state activist is counted as \"tied to Ferguson,\" then the pool of those \"tied to Ferguson\" is likely hundreds of thousands, so large that six deaths is a drop in the bucket.\nAP reports that \"24-year-old Danye Jones was found hanging from a tree in the yard of his north St. Louis County home.\" However, as they note, it was his mother who was active in Ferguson, not him. She insists her son's death was a lynching, but police say there was no sign of a struggle and the family themselves reported it to police as a suicide.\nThis leaves us with only three deaths of actual Ferguson protesters. Yes, \"Edward Crawford Jr., 27, fatally shot himself in May 2017 after telling acquaintances he had been distraught over personal issues,\" but AP omits that he did so in front of two witnesses. Bassem Masri was found dead of a fentanyl overdose on public transportation; AP omits he was open about his history of heroin addiction.\nDarren Seals was killed in the same manner as Deandre Joshua, likely prompting the conspiracy theories in the first place. But a Daily Beast investigation found four other men in the Ferguson area were also found shot in cars that were set on fire, with three killings confirmed to be carried out by locals. It seems to be a common MO in the area to burn cars to destroy forensic evidence.\nSeals also sadly fits the profile of the sort of man who might find himself caught up in violent crime. \"Caught my first felony at the age of 18 for slamming a cop on his head. Was shot 7 times and had a smile on my face the whole time,\" he wrote in a Facebook post. Those seven bullets were the second time he had been shot; his murder was the third. Even within the Ferguson protest movement he was a divisive figure, once physically attacking fellow activist DeRay McKesson in a parking lot.\nThe \"Ferguson body count\" is only plausible if you exclude all exculpatory evidence, insist every police statement is a lie, and failed high school statistics. It's distressing to see activists pushing such a deranged conspiracy theory, but it's even sadder to see media outlets fanning the flames.\nAlex is a staff writer at the Washington Free Beacon.

Anthony List, said O'Rourke is just &quot;another abortion extremist&quot; in the Democratic field.</p>\n<p>&quot;Beto cannot even say one point in pregnancy&mdash;or immediately after&mdash;when he would protect the life of an innocent child,&quot; Quigley said. &quot;This radicalism is out of step with voters and even the Democrat party's own base.&quot;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/issues/voters-oppose-democrats-stance-on-abortion/\">Multiple</a> <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/politics/poll-80-disagree-with-hillary-clintons-abortion-position/\">polls</a> have shown that limits to late-term abortions are popular among the general public, a majority of Democrats, and even a <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/issues/three-four-americans-support-significant-restrictions-abortion/\">large percentage</a> of those who self-identify as pro-choice. Maureen Ferguson, a senior policy adviser at the Catholic Association, said that O'Rourke and his fellow Democrats could alienate voters in a general election. She also emphasized that the abortions in question center on babies capable of living outside of the womb thanks to advances in medical care.</p>\n<p>&quot;Cavalierly proclaiming support for third trimester abortion may be in vogue in today's Democratic primary for the 2020 candidates, but it's the wrong way to win a general election,&quot; Ferguson said. &quot;It's also endorsing infanticide; a baby in the 7th, 8th and 9th month of pregnancy is viable and can live outside the womb.&quot;</p>\n<p>Terry Schilling, executive director of the American Principles Project, said O'Rourke's stance contradicts the &quot;moderate&quot; image he cultivated during his political career. Schilling was not surprised by O'Rourke's shift given the state of abortion politics among liberals and the Democratic base. The 2016 Democratic platform endorsed taxpayer-funded abortion for all Americans&mdash;a departure from previous years&mdash;but stopped short of opposing limits to late-term abortion. Schilling expects that to change in 2020.</p>\n<p>&quot;Democrats are in a race to the bottom on abortion,&quot; Schilling said. &quot;The party litmus test is now enthusiastic support for third-trimester abortions&mdash;and Beto just passed with flying colors.&quot;</p>\n<p>Late-term abortion has become a defining issue for Democratic presidential hopefuls in the wake of New York passing legislation that allows abortion up until the point of birth. A similar proposal in Virginia drew national attention when Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam told a local radio station that he supported the bill and indicated that babies who survive abortion can be allowed to die on the table if a mother wishes.</p>\n<p>O'Rourke's 2020 competitors, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I., VT), Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), Cory Booker (D., N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.), and Kamala Harris (D., Calif.), all <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/issues/2020-dem-presidential-hopefuls-vote-to-block-newborn-care/\">voted against a bill</a> that would ensure doctors provide care to such newborns.</p>\n<p><strong>Bill McMorris</strong> is senior editor for the <em>Washington Free Beacon</em>.

                "text": "Pro-life groups are criticizing former representative Robert Francis O'Rourke after he endorsed late-term abortion at an Ohio campaign rally.\nO'Rourke said he supports abortion in the third trimester of pregnancy when asked about the issue on Monday evening.\n\"The question is about abortion and reproductive rights and my answer to you is that should be a decision that the woman makes. I trust her,\" O'Rourke said.\nDavid Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.\nSign up here and stay informed!\nPro-life groups have begun speaking out against O'Rourke, a former three-term Texas congressman who lost a Senate race to Ted Cruz in November.\nMallory Quigley, spokeswoman for the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said O'Rourke is just \"another abortion extremist\" in the Democratic field.\n\"Beto cannot even say one point in pregnancy\u2014or immediately after\u2014when he would protect the life of an innocent child,\" Quigley said. \"This radicalism is out of step with voters and even the Democrat party's own base.\"\nMultiple polls have shown that limits to late-term abortions are popular among the general public, a majority of Democrats, and even a large percentage of those who self-identify as pro-choice. Maureen Ferguson, a senior policy adviser at the Catholic Association, said that O'Rourke and his fellow Democrats could alienate voters in a general election. She also emphasized that the abortions in question center on babies capable of living outside of the womb thanks to advances in medical care.\n\"Cavalierly proclaiming support for third trimester abortion may be in vogue in today's Democratic primary for the 2020 candidates, but it's the wrong way to win a general election,\" Ferguson said. \"It's also endorsing infanticide; a baby in the 7th, 8th and 9th month of pregnancy is viable and can live outside the womb.\"\nTerry Schilling, executive director of the American Principles Project, said O'Rourke's stance contradicts the \"moderate\" image he cultivated during his political career. Schilling was not surprised by O'Rourke's shift given the state of abortion politics among liberals and the Democratic base. The 2016 Democratic platform endorsed taxpayer-funded abortion for all Americans\u2014a departure from previous years\u2014but stopped short of opposing limits to late-term abortion. Schilling expects that to change in 2020.\n\"Democrats are in a race to the bottom on abortion,\" Schilling said. \"The party litmus test is now enthusiastic support for third-trimester abortions\u2014and Beto just passed with flying colors.\"\nLate-term abortion has become a defining issue for Democratic presidential hopefuls in the wake of New York passing legislation that allows abortion up until the point of birth. A similar proposal in Virginia drew national attention when Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam told a local radio station that he supported the bill and indicated that babies who survive abortion can be allowed to die on the table if a mother wishes.\nO'Rourke's 2020 competitors, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I., VT), Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), Cory Booker (D., N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.), and Kamala Harris (D., Calif.), all voted against a bill that would ensure doctors provide care to such newborns.\nBill McMorris is senior editor for the Washington Free Beacon.

George Holding (R., Ga.), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, petitioned Secretary of Education Betsy Devos in a <a href=\"https://holding.house.gov/uploadedfiles/conferenceletter.pdf\">letter</a> sent Monday to investigate the events, which the lawmaker described as featuring &quot;severe <a href=\"http://www.thetower.org/7397-part-1-unc-duke-conference-on-gaza-whitewashes-hamas-blasts-israel/\">anti-Israeli</a> <a href=\"https://voice4israel.com/category/israel-under-attack-at-unc-and-duke/\">bias</a> and explicit <a href=\"https://abc11.com/politics/video-shows-rappers-performance-of-anti-semitic-song-at-unc-event/5243623/\">anti-Semitism</a>.&quot;</p>\n<p>Holding had received a spate phone calls from citizens concerned about the anti-Semitic events.</p>\n<p>David Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.</p>\n<p>Sign up here and stay informed!</p>\n<p>The conference in question, titled &quot;Conflict over Gaza: People, Politics, and Possibilities,&quot; was <a href=\"https://www.unc.edu/event/conference-conflict-over-gaza-people-politics-and-possibilities/\">co-sponsored</a> by the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies, which is said to have &quot;applied for and received a $235,000 grant through the Department of Education in 2018.&quot;</p>\n<p>The anti-Israel events have generated controversy at both schools due to what observers have described as a vitriolic anti-Israel bias that fosters an unsafe environment on campus for Jewish students. Duke has come under fire in past moths for hosting similar events that witnesses have described as anti-Israel.</p>\n<p>Duke is still facing the fallout over the <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/issues/duke-university-faces-anti-semitism-charges-for-editorial-smearing-aipac/\">publication</a> by its student newspaper of an opinion piece defending Rep. Ilhan Omar from charges of anti-Semitism and defending her use of language accusing pro-Israel and Jewish lawmakers of holding dual loyalty, a classic anti-Semitic trope.</p>\n<p>Many of the events have been hosted by Students for Justice in Palestine, a student group known to distribute anti-Semitic propaganda, and other pro-Palestinian campus groups that watchdog groups have cited as contributing to rising anti-Semitism on America's college campuses.</p>\n<p>&quot;A number of my constituents have reached out to me expressing concern over what they tell me are reports of severe anti-Israeli bias and anti-Semitic rhetoric at a taxpayer-funded conference, &lsquo;Conflict Over Gaza: People, Politics, and Possibilities,' held between March 22nd-24th at the University of North Carolina (UNC), in conjunction with Duke University (Duke),&quot; Holding wrote in his letter.</p>\n<p>Further information about these events obtained by the <em>Washington Free Beacon</em> indicates that several speakers and participants in the events discussed holding meetings with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestinian, or PFLP, a designated foreign terror organization.</p>\n<p>During these events&mdash;which hosted speakers such as Palestinian activist Linda Sarsour, who has been accused of anti-Semitism&mdash;Israel is said to have been maligned along with pro-Israel Jews.</p>\n<p>&quot;According to first-hand accounts, the conference had a radical anti-Israeli bias,&quot; Holding wrote in the letter, reporting accounts described by concerned constituents. &quot;Reportedly, speakers and panelists distorted facts and misrepresented the complex situation in Gaza. A video recently surfaced depicting the main musical performer, rapper Tamer Nafar, singing a brazenly anti-Semitic song.&quot;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, &quot;examination of the official program reveals that several of the conference's speakers are actively involved in the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement,&quot; according to Holding's letter.</p>\n<p>The nature of these events calls into questions the Department of Education's decision to grant the school's $235,000 in taxpayer funds. Lawmakers such as Holding maintain that federal dollars should not be spent to promote anti-Israel exhibits on campus.</p>\n<p>&quot;If these reports are accurate, I have difficulty understanding why tax dollars should be spent on such an activity,&quot; Holding wrote, including a list of questions to be answered by the Education Department.</p>\n<p>Holding is seeking to determine if the Education Department has policies in place to prevent federal dollars from promoting anti-Israel agendas. He also is seeking to determine if violence was glorified during these events and whether the reports of anti-Semitism surrounding the events would warrant a revocation of remaining federal dollars.</p>\n<p>&quot;Prior to the event, local religious and community organizations, academics and citizens wrote the universities expressing concern that the conference lacked balance and appeared designed to promote a radical agenda,&quot; Holding wrote. &quot;Apparently, these concerns were ignored, with no mainstream speakers or panelists included in the three-day conference.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Honest academic debate featuring diverse perspectives and a wide-range of views is critical in a democratic society and a central tenet of America's educational system,&quot; the letter states. &quot;However, it is irresponsible, immoral, and unproductive for taxpayer dollars to fund overtly biased advocacy camouflaged as academic discourse.&quot;</p>\n<p>Duke did not respond to <em>Free Beacon</em> requests for comment, but did provide a recent <a href=\"https://abc11.com/politics/video-shows-rappers-performance-of-anti-semitic-song-at-unc-event/5243623/\">statement</a> to local news outlets.</p>\n<p>&quot;We want to be very clear: antisemitism is one of the great scourges of modern life,&quot; read a joint statement from Duke University President Vincent E. Price and Provost Sally Kornbluth. &quot;Its resurgence, as demonstrated by the worldwide increase in hate crimes and incidents, is deeply troubling and should be of great concern to any civil society.</p>\n<p>&quot;Whether it occurs on our campus, in our community, through graffiti, rallies or concerts, in conference rooms or courtrooms, we must all speak out forcefully against actions and statements that target and threaten members of our Jewish community. On our campus and beyond, the lines of politics, trust, activism and civility cannot become so blurred that we lose our commitment to mutual respect. We must guard against the danger that our passions obscure our common humanity, and we must remind ourselves that what injures any one of us injures us all.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Adam Kredo</strong> is senior writer reporting on national security and foreign policy matters for the Washington Free Beacon.

George Holding (R., Ga.), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, petitioned Secretary of Education Betsy Devos in a letter sent Monday to investigate the events, which the lawmaker described as featuring \"severe anti-Israeli bias and explicit anti-Semitism.\"\nHolding had received a spate phone calls from citizens concerned about the anti-Semitic events.\nDavid Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.\nSign up here and stay informed!\nThe conference in question, titled \"Conflict over Gaza: People, Politics, and Possibilities,\" was co-sponsored by the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies, which is said to have \"applied for and received a $235,000 grant through the Department of Education in 2018.\"\nThe anti-Israel events have generated controversy at both schools due to what observers have described as a vitriolic anti-Israel bias that fosters an unsafe environment on campus for Jewish students. Duke has come under fire in past moths for hosting similar events that witnesses have described as anti-Israel.\nDuke is still facing the fallout over the publication by its student newspaper of an opinion piece defending Rep. Ilhan Omar from charges of anti-Semitism and defending her use of language accusing pro-Israel and Jewish lawmakers of holding dual loyalty, a classic anti-Semitic trope.\nMany of the events have been hosted by Students for Justice in Palestine, a student group known to distribute anti-Semitic propaganda, and other pro-Palestinian campus groups that watchdog groups have cited as contributing to rising anti-Semitism on America's college campuses.\n\"A number of my constituents have reached out to me expressing concern over what they tell me are reports of severe anti-Israeli bias and anti-Semitic rhetoric at a taxpayer-funded conference, \u2018Conflict Over Gaza: People, Politics, and Possibilities,' held between March 22nd-24th at the University of North Carolina (UNC), in conjunction with Duke University (Duke),\" Holding wrote in his letter.\nFurther information about these events obtained by the Washington Free Beacon indicates that several speakers and participants in the events discussed holding meetings with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestinian, or PFLP, a designated foreign terror organization.\nDuring these events\u2014which hosted speakers such as Palestinian activist Linda Sarsour, who has been accused of anti-Semitism\u2014Israel is said to have been maligned along with pro-Israel Jews.\n\"According to first-hand accounts, the conference had a radical anti-Israeli bias,\" Holding wrote in the letter, reporting accounts described by concerned constituents. \"Reportedly, speakers and panelists distorted facts and misrepresented the complex situation in Gaza. A video recently surfaced depicting the main musical performer, rapper Tamer Nafar, singing a brazenly anti-Semitic song.\"\nFurthermore, \"examination of the official program reveals that several of the conference's speakers are actively involved in the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement,\" according to Holding's letter.\nThe nature of these events calls into questions the Department of Education's decision to grant the school's $235,000 in taxpayer funds. Lawmakers such as Holding maintain that federal dollars should not be spent to promote anti-Israel exhibits on campus.\n\"If these reports are accurate, I have difficulty understanding why tax dollars should be spent on such an activity,\" Holding wrote, including a list of questions to be answered by the Education Department.\nHolding is seeking to determine if the Education Department has policies in place to prevent federal dollars from promoting anti-Israel agendas. He also is seeking to determine if violence was glorified during these events and whether the reports of anti-Semitism surrounding the events would warrant a revocation of remaining federal dollars.\n\"Prior to the event, local religious and community organizations, academics and citizens wrote the universities expressing concern that the conference lacked balance and appeared designed to promote a radical agenda,\" Holding wrote. \"Apparently, these concerns were ignored, with no mainstream speakers or panelists included in the three-day conference.\"\n\"Honest academic debate featuring diverse perspectives and a wide-range of views is critical in a democratic society and a central tenet of America's educational system,\" the letter states. \"However, it is irresponsible, immoral, and unproductive for taxpayer dollars to fund overtly biased advocacy camouflaged as academic discourse.\"\nDuke did not respond to Free Beacon requests for comment, but did provide a recent statement to local news outlets.\n\"We want to be very clear: antisemitism is one of the great scourges of modern life,\" read a joint statement from Duke University President Vincent E. Price and Provost Sally Kornbluth. \"Its resurgence, as demonstrated by the worldwide increase in hate crimes and incidents, is deeply troubling and should be of great concern to any civil society.\n\"Whether it occurs on our campus, in our community, through graffiti, rallies or concerts, in conference rooms or courtrooms, we must all speak out forcefully against actions and statements that target and threaten members of our Jewish community. On our campus and beyond, the lines of politics, trust, activism and civility cannot become so blurred that we lose our commitment to mutual respect. We must guard against the danger that our passions obscure our common humanity, and we must remind ourselves that what injures any one of us injures us all.\"\nAdam Kredo is senior writer reporting on national security and foreign policy matters for the Washington Free Beacon.

The comprehensive bill, according to Westerman's office, &quot;addresses major drivers of health care costs as well as obstacles hindering individuals from obtaining health insurance coverage.&quot;</p>\n<p>It aims to do so through a bevy of changes to the health care market. Many of the bill's provisions target availability of insurance to those who otherwise lack access, most prominently by implementing a system of <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20170302.059003/full/\">invisible high-risk insurance pools</a>.

Provisions of that bill, incorporated by the FCA, would work to expand the supply of hospitals, responding to an industry that has <a href=\"https://www.kaufmanhall.com/sites/default/files/legacy_files/kh_report-ma-year-in-review_d4-rebrand.pdf\">grown increasingly concentrated</a> in recent years. The HCA would, among other provisions, require hospitals in highly concentrated regions to accept Medicare reimbursement rates from commercial payers, dragging down profits; it would also expand the Federal Trade Commission's staff responsible for overseeing the effects of hospital mergers.</p>\n<p>In addition to inter-hospital competition, the FCA would try to increase competition among pharmaceutical firms to help cut the cost of non-genericized drugs, primarily by limiting the period of exclusivity for certain drugs and accelerating the availability of generics.</p>\n<p>The FCA would additionally repeal a number of taxes on health insurers, which Westerman said are often passed on to consumers, as well as the employer mandate included in Obamacare.</p>\n<p><strong>Charles Fain Lehman</strong> is a staff writer for the Washington Free Beacon.

It also allows the setting up of short-term limited duration plans and associated health plans, which Westerman said Tuesday would increase competition.\nCompetition, in fact, is at the heart of the FCA, which includes Banks's Hospital Competition Act of 2019. Provisions of that bill, incorporated by the FCA, would work to expand the supply of hospitals, responding to an industry that has grown increasingly concentrated in recent years. The HCA would, among other provisions, require hospitals in highly concentrated regions to accept Medicare reimbursement rates from commercial payers, dragging down profits; it would also expand the Federal Trade Commission's staff responsible for overseeing the effects of hospital mergers.\nIn addition to inter-hospital competition, the FCA would try to increase competition among pharmaceutical firms to help cut the cost of non-genericized drugs, primarily by limiting the period of exclusivity for certain drugs and accelerating the availability of generics.\nThe FCA would additionally repeal a number of taxes on health insurers, which Westerman said are often passed on to consumers, as well as the employer mandate included in Obamacare.\nCharles Fain Lehman is a staff writer for the Washington Free Beacon.

(New sales of &quot;machineguns&quot; were outlawed under an amendment to the National Firearms Act in 1986.) Judge Friedrich argued the agency didn't err in claiming bump stocks enable firearms to fire multiple rounds with a &quot;single function of the trigger,&quot; even though the trigger resets between each round fired and requires the trigger to be actuated for each round fired. The judge argued that the statutory definition of &quot;machinegun&quot; is vague and the ATF is therefore free to reinterpret it in the way they did.</p>\n<p>&quot;Because the statute does not provide any additional guidance on the correct interpretation, the Court concludes that the term is ambiguous,&quot; Judge Friedrich <a href=\"https://assets.nationbuilder.com/firearmspolicycoalition/pages/5186/attachments/original/1551148203/27-memo.pdf?1551148203\">wrote in her ruling</a>.</p>\n<p>David Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.</p>\n<p>Sign up here and stay informed!</p>\n<p>She went on to argue a bump stock automates specific functions that would otherwise need to be done manually when bump firing.</p>\n<p>&quot;The bump stock makes it easier to bump fire because it controls the distance the firearm recoils and ensures that the firearm moves linearly&mdash;two tasks the shooter would ordinarily have to perform manually,&quot; she wrote. &quot;In this way, a bump stock creates a &lsquo;self-acting mechanism' that permits &lsquo;the discharge of multiple rounds' with &lsquo;a single function of the trigger &hellip; without manual reloading.'&quot;</p>\n<p>The Firearms Policy Coalition and Firearms Policy Foundation, which filed the lawsuit, said they were unhappy with the ruling but would move forward with litigation.</p>\n<p>&quot;We are disappointed but unsurprised by the Court's ruling tonight denying a temporary injunction to protect Americans from an unlawful and unconstitutional regulation,&quot; the gun-rights groups said in a statement. &quot;It is important to note that today's order is not a final ruling on any claim, and is merely a trial court's denial of a temporary injunction.

Rather, the authors find, an increase to the minimum wage drives up property crime rates among 16-to-24-year-olds, the group most likely to be working for minimum wage already.</p>\n<p>Myriad factors determine whether or not people choose to commit crimes, <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/chapters/c3625.pdf\">including economic ones</a>. Access to jobs, steady income, and education, can all influence whether or not a person begins a career as a criminal. This has a practical implication for policymakers looking to reduce crime: In addition to expensive interventions like increasing incarceration or the <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/issues/cops-means-less-crime-analysis-shows/\">number of cops</a>, enhancing labor market access and outcomes might be an effective approach.</p>\n<p>David Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.</p>\n<p>Sign up here and stay informed!</p>\n<p>This insight is the basis for an argument put forward by the Council of Economic Advisers under then-President Barack Obama in 2016. As part of <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/CEA%2BCriminal%2BJustice%2BReport.pdf\">a broader overview</a> of economics and the criminal justice system, the CEA conducted a &quot;back-of-the-envelope&quot; analysis and concluded that raising the minimum wage to $12 by 2020 would cut the crime rate by 3 to 5 percent&mdash;equivalent to 250,000 to 510,000 crimes.</p>\n<p>However, there is a problem with this approach. Although the minimum wage increases take-home wages for some workers, it <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/issues/study-dem-wage-hike-will-cut-2-million-jobs/\">also leads to</a> reduced hours and job loss among workers. This is especially true for those whose skill level who puts the market value of their labor below the floor imposed by the minimum wage&mdash;a situation which increasingly encourages the replacement of <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/issues/robots-arent-going-to-take-your-job-yet/\">people with robots</a>.</p>\n<p>These effects, especially when they fall on otherwise low-skill Americans, may actually lead to a net increase in the amount of crime following a minimum wage hike. This could be because a lost job or hours could lead to petty larceny to get by; because the emotional impact of losing a job could be expressed in criminal behavior; or because of lost human-capital benefits thanks to a hike's effect on school enrollment and on-the-job training.</p>\n<p>The new paper, &quot;Do Minimum Wage Increases Reduce Crime?&quot; attempts to quantify the reality of the CEA's claim, and whether or not it is drowned out by adverse effects.

                "text": "A $15 per hour minimum wage would lead to $2.4 billion in property crimes, a new paper released Monday argues.\nThe paper directly contradicts past arguments, most prominently from the Obama-era Council of Economic Advisers, that raising the minimum wage would reduce crime rates. Rather, the authors find, an increase to the minimum wage drives up property crime rates among 16-to-24-year-olds, the group most likely to be working for minimum wage already.\nMyriad factors determine whether or not people choose to commit crimes, including economic ones. Access to jobs, steady income, and education, can all influence whether or not a person begins a career as a criminal. This has a practical implication for policymakers looking to reduce crime: In addition to expensive interventions like increasing incarceration or the number of cops, enhancing labor market access and outcomes might be an effective approach.\nDavid Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.\nSign up here and stay informed!\nThis insight is the basis for an argument put forward by the Council of Economic Advisers under then-President Barack Obama in 2016. As part of a broader overview of economics and the criminal justice system, the CEA conducted a \"back-of-the-envelope\" analysis and concluded that raising the minimum wage to $12 by 2020 would cut the crime rate by 3 to 5 percent\u2014equivalent to 250,000 to 510,000 crimes.\nHowever, there is a problem with this approach. Although the minimum wage increases take-home wages for some workers, it also leads to reduced hours and job loss among workers. This is especially true for those whose skill level who puts the market value of their labor below the floor imposed by the minimum wage\u2014a situation which increasingly encourages the replacement of people with robots.\nThese effects, especially when they fall on otherwise low-skill Americans, may actually lead to a net increase in the amount of crime following a minimum wage hike. This could be because a lost job or hours could lead to petty larceny to get by; because the emotional impact of losing a job could be expressed in criminal behavior; or because of lost human-capital benefits thanks to a hike's effect on school enrollment and on-the-job training.\nThe new paper, \"Do Minimum Wage Increases Reduce Crime?\" attempts to quantify the reality of the CEA's claim, and whether or not it is drowned out by adverse effects. The results are not heartening for minimum-wage advocates.\nThe authors, a group of economists, estimate that a minimum wage hike to $12 would result in approximately 231,000 additional property crimes annually, equivalent to costs of $1.3 billion. A $15 minimum wage would result in 410,000 additional property crimes, equivalent to $2.4 billion in costs.\n\"We find little evidence that minimum wage increases affect violent or drug crimes, or net crime among older individuals, but do increase delinquency-related crimes related to teenage idleness,\" the authors write. \"We conclude that increasing the minimum wage will at best be ineffective at deterring crime and at worst will have unintended consequences that increase property crime among young adults.\"\nTo reach these conclusions, the paper's authors rely on county-level arrest records from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting system. To these records, they add information on minimum wage increases between 1998 and 2016 by county, state, and federal law, in order to exploit the way that the minimum wage has changed in different places at different times.\nUsing these figures and standard statistical methods, the authors estimate the effect of the minimum wage level on the crime rates of 16-to-24 year-olds in each county and year, the group on which changes in the minimum wage has the most impact, and who are most crime-prone. They also compare their results for that age-group against those over 25.\nThe results of their analysis with the UCR indicate that there is a statistically significant effect of a higher minimum wage on increasing property crime arrests, but neither drug nor violent crime arrests. These effects are consistently significant among 16-to-24-year-olds, not among those 25 and over. They are most significant in urban counties (those with 100,000+ population), and do not vary significantly across races.\nImportantly, most of the crime increase among 16-to-24-year-olds is driven by an increase in petty larceny; the authors find no evidence that minimum wage hikes affect other types of property crimes or any violent crimes.\nIn addition to the UCR, the study uses survey data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which tracks the wage levels and criminal behavior of a cohort of respondents surveyed regularly from their adolescence in 1997. Using these data, the authors also identify an increased likelihood of engaging in property crimes among 16-to-24-year-olds affected by the minimum wage.

While President Donald Trump has promised a &quot;maximum pressure&quot; campaign to choke off Tehran's resources, the State and Treasury Departments have advocated in favor of waivers permitting Iran to continue sensitive nuclear work as well as its lucrative oil trade.</p>\n<p>The debate has split certain elements of the Trump administration and will come to a head in the coming weeks as a series of sanctions waivers permitting eight countries to continue purchasing Iranian crude oil is set to expire in May.</p>\n<p>David Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.</p>\n<p>Sign up here and stay informed!</p>\n<p>Already, some elements of the administration are pushing to issue another round of sanctions waivers, prompting outrage on Capitol Hill where multiple officials stand ready to fight that potential decision.</p>\n<p>At stake is the future of the Iranian nuclear deal itself, which has been on life support since Trump abandoned the agreement in pursuit of tough new sanctions. While the United States has withdrawn from the agreement, there remain elements of the Trump administration who view it as sacrosanct and are hoping to outlast the president. There is support for this position among many European allies who have been searching for ways to skirt U.S. sanctions and continue doing business with Iran.</p>\n<p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), a vocal opponent of the deal, told the <em>Washington Free Beacon </em>he is aware of elements within the Trump administration who are working behind the president's back to save the nuclear deal.</p>\n<p>&quot;A nuclear Iran is the most pressing near-term threat to American national security and to the survival of our Middle East allies,&quot; Cruz said. &quot;Every waiver for Iran either allows them to work toward their nuclear goal, or pays for terrorists to attack us, or both.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;The president understands that basic fact but it appears that not everyone in the administration is totally on board. Maximum pressure should mean maximum pressure,&quot; Cruz said. &quot;Enough's enough.&quot;</p>\n<p>The fight over new oil waivers, which the <em>Free Beacon</em> has reported on multiple times in recent months, is fracturing certain elements of the administration, particularly in the State Department, which has the power to issue sanctions waivers.</p>\n<p>It remains unclear which direction Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is leaning. State Department officials took nearly a week to respond to <em>Free Beacon</em> requests for comment on the matter and would not provide a definitive answer.</p>\n<p>&quot;For now Secretary Pompeo has not made a decision,&quot; said one U.S. official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak on record. &quot;He is in listening mode.&quot;</p>\n<p>Pompeo is set for yet another trip to the Middle East for top-level meetings in Israel, where sanctions waivers are expected to be a topic of conversation among Israeli officials who want to see Iran's economy fully cut off.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our policy goal remains to get all countries to stop purchasing Iranian crude as quickly as possible,&quot; a State Department official told the <em>Free Beacon</em>. &quot;We continue to discuss our Iran-related sanctions with our partners to ensure continued compliance. Any decisions related to sanctions waivers are at the discretion of the secretary of state.&quot;</p>\n<p>The White House National Security Council appears to be more forward leaning than the State Department on the matter.</p>\n<p>One senior Trump administration official, speaking only on background, told the <em>Free Beacon</em> that there is no good reason to issue more oil waivers. The marketplace, the senior official said, is more than prepared to absorb the full removal of Iranian crude.</p>\n<p>&quot;The U.S. is approaching the May decision point on the renewal of eight countries with waivers,&quot; the senior official said. &quot;The administration's goal, as has been repeatedly made clear, is to get to zero exceptions and the oil market appears well positioned to deal with the removal of Iranian barrels.&quot;</p>\n<p>Leading GOP lawmakers are now taking the unusual step of demanding the Trump administration stop issuing oil waivers when the current batch expires in May. They view the decision as critical to the administration's stated goal of &quot;maximum pressure&quot; on Tehran.</p>\n<p>&quot;I urge President Trump to end all waivers for U.S. sanctions laws against foreign purchasers of Iranian oil,&quot; Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) told the <em>Free Beacon</em>. &quot;Given that international oil markets appear to have more than enough surplus capacity to offset losses of Iranian oil, it's time for the U.S. to take this step and truly maximize pressure against the terror-sponsoring and nuclear weapons-seeking regime in Tehran.&quot;</p>\n<p>Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) told the <em>Free Beacon</em> that the cash windfalls Iran receives from its lucrative oil trade go to fund its global terror operations, which have targeted U.S. forces in the region, as well as allies such as Israel and Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>&quot;The Iranian regime uses its petrodollars to fund terrorism and sow chaos throughout the region,&quot; Cotton said. &quot;Going forward, the proper amount of oil exports from Iran is zero.&quot;</p>\n<p>Iran hawks on Capitol Hill are said to have been further riled by a Monday <em>Free Beacon</em> report on Iran's construction of two new nuclear plants, which could provide Tehran with a plutonium pathway to the bomb. This type of nuclear work was permitted by the nuclear deal, and is still believed to be legal due to another series of waivers issued by the State Department allowing Iran to continue performing nuclear research, including at a site that once housed its nuclear weapons program. These waivers have become a second flashpoint in the inter-agency battle over the administration's Iran policy.</p>\n<p>There also is support for a hardline sanctions policy among Republican members in the House.</p>\n<p>&quot;The oil waiver issue gets to the heart of the matter: whether or not the United States should be engaged in a maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime,&quot; Rep. Mike Gallagher (R., Wis.) told the <em>Free Beacon</em>. &quot;I strongly believe we should. This is why last Congress, I introduced legislation along with Senator Cruz to effectively cut Iran off from the global financial system. We need to continue to use all the tools at our disposal to eliminate this regime's funding.&quot;</p>\n<p>Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) also supports putting maximum pressure on the Iranian regime and not granting any further sanctions waivers for Iran to sell oil.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"> <p>U.S. should not grant any more waivers for Iran to sell oil. Iran uses sales to fund terrorism, missiles and nukes. &quot;U.S. Officials Say the Oil Market Can Withstand No Iranian Exports This Year.&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/eQFMn5ZFGr\">https://t.co/eQFMn5ZFGr</a></p> <p>&mdash; Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1106943827061997569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 16, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>One senior GOP congressional official, speaking only on background, told the <em>Free Beacon</em> that it is well past time for the administration to take its Iran policy seriously. This means no more waivers and no more wiggle room for Tehran to line its pockets.</p>\n<p>&quot;If our policy objective is to &lsquo;go to zero,' our policymakers should go to zero,&quot; the source said. &quot;There's no excuse not to when global oil markets have more than enough spare capacity to offset the loss of all Iranian oil supply.&quot;</p>\n<p>One veteran Iran policy hand familiar with the battle between Congress and the State Department blamed officials at the State Department for working to undermine Trump's policy toward Iran.</p>\n<p>&quot;There's an old as dirt expression in Washington D.C., which is that Democrats organize and Republicans atomize,&quot; said the source, who would only speak on background. &quot;What it means is that it's impossible to unify any significant group of congressional Republicans around any significant issue. Yet somehow the pro-waivers team at the State Department has managed to do it.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Adam Kredo</strong> is senior writer reporting on national security and foreign policy matters for the Washington Free Beacon.

                "text": "Leading Republican senators are uniting against what they describe as a bid by some elements of the Trump administration to keep the Iran nuclear deal on life support via a package of waivers exempting Tehran and its allies from new sanctions spearheaded by President Donald Trump, according to multiple conversations with top congressional officials both on and off the record.\nA debate has been raging inside the Trump administration for months over how far it will go to sanction the Iranian regime. While President Donald Trump has promised a \"maximum pressure\" campaign to choke off Tehran's resources, the State and Treasury Departments have advocated in favor of waivers permitting Iran to continue sensitive nuclear work as well as its lucrative oil trade.\nThe debate has split certain elements of the Trump administration and will come to a head in the coming weeks as a series of sanctions waivers permitting eight countries to continue purchasing Iranian crude oil is set to expire in May.\nDavid Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.\nSign up here and stay informed!\nAlready, some elements of the administration are pushing to issue another round of sanctions waivers, prompting outrage on Capitol Hill where multiple officials stand ready to fight that potential decision.\nAt stake is the future of the Iranian nuclear deal itself, which has been on life support since Trump abandoned the agreement in pursuit of tough new sanctions. While the United States has withdrawn from the agreement, there remain elements of the Trump administration who view it as sacrosanct and are hoping to outlast the president. There is support for this position among many European allies who have been searching for ways to skirt U.S. sanctions and continue doing business with Iran.\nSen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), a vocal opponent of the deal, told the Washington Free Beacon he is aware of elements within the Trump administration who are working behind the president's back to save the nuclear deal.\n\"A nuclear Iran is the most pressing near-term threat to American national security and to the survival of our Middle East allies,\" Cruz said. \"Every waiver for Iran either allows them to work toward their nuclear goal, or pays for terrorists to attack us, or both.\"\n\"The president understands that basic fact but it appears that not everyone in the administration is totally on board. Maximum pressure should mean maximum pressure,\" Cruz said. \"Enough's enough.\"\nThe fight over new oil waivers, which the Free Beacon has reported on multiple times in recent months, is fracturing certain elements of the administration, particularly in the State Department, which has the power to issue sanctions waivers.\nIt remains unclear which direction Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is leaning. State Department officials took nearly a week to respond to Free Beacon requests for comment on the matter and would not provide a definitive answer.\n\"For now Secretary Pompeo has not made a decision,\" said one U.S. official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak on record. \"He is in listening mode.\"\nPompeo is set for yet another trip to the Middle East for top-level meetings in Israel, where sanctions waivers are expected to be a topic of conversation among Israeli officials who want to see Iran's economy fully cut off.\n\"Our policy goal remains to get all countries to stop purchasing Iranian crude as quickly as possible,\" a State Department official told the Free Beacon. \"We continue to discuss our Iran-related sanctions with our partners to ensure continued compliance. Any decisions related to sanctions waivers are at the discretion of the secretary of state.\"\nThe White House National Security Council appears to be more forward leaning than the State Department on the matter.\nOne senior Trump administration official, speaking only on background, told the Free Beacon that there is no good reason to issue more oil waivers. The marketplace, the senior official said, is more than prepared to absorb the full removal of Iranian crude.\n\"The U.S. is approaching the May decision point on the renewal of eight countries with waivers,\" the senior official said. \"The administration's goal, as has been repeatedly made clear, is to get to zero exceptions and the oil market appears well positioned to deal with the removal of Iranian barrels.\"\nLeading GOP lawmakers are now taking the unusual step of demanding the Trump administration stop issuing oil waivers when the current batch expires in May. They view the decision as critical to the administration's stated goal of \"maximum pressure\" on Tehran.\n\"I urge President Trump to end all waivers for U.S. sanctions laws against foreign purchasers of Iranian oil,\" Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) told the Free Beacon. \"Given that international oil markets appear to have more than enough surplus capacity to offset losses of Iranian oil, it's time for the U.S. to take this step and truly maximize pressure against the terror-sponsoring and nuclear weapons-seeking regime in Tehran.\"\nSen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) told the Free Beacon that the cash windfalls Iran receives from its lucrative oil trade go to fund its global terror operations, which have targeted U.S. forces in the region, as well as allies such as Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\"The Iranian regime uses its petrodollars to fund terrorism and sow chaos throughout the region,\" Cotton said. \"Going forward, the proper amount of oil exports from Iran is zero.\"\nIran hawks on Capitol Hill are said to have been further riled by a Monday Free Beacon report on Iran's construction of two new nuclear plants, which could provide Tehran with a plutonium pathway to the bomb. This type of nuclear work was permitted by the nuclear deal, and is still believed to be legal due to another series of waivers issued by the State Department allowing Iran to continue performing nuclear research, including at a site that once housed its nuclear weapons program. These waivers have become a second flashpoint in the inter-agency battle over the administration's Iran policy.\nThere also is support for a hardline sanctions policy among Republican members in the House.\n\"The oil waiver issue gets to the heart of the matter: whether or not the United States should be engaged in a maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime,\" Rep. Mike Gallagher (R., Wis.) told the Free Beacon. \"I strongly believe we should. This is why last Congress, I introduced legislation along with Senator Cruz to effectively cut Iran off from the global financial system. We need to continue to use all the tools at our disposal to eliminate this regime's funding.\"\nRep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) also supports putting maximum pressure on the Iranian regime and not granting any further sanctions waivers for Iran to sell oil.\nU.S. should not grant any more waivers for Iran to sell oil. Iran uses sales to fund terrorism, missiles and nukes. \"U.S. Officials Say the Oil Market Can Withstand No Iranian Exports This Year.\" https://t.co/eQFMn5ZFGr\n\u2014 Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) March 16, 2019\nOne senior GOP congressional official, speaking only on background, told the Free Beacon that it is well past time for the administration to take its Iran policy seriously. This means no more waivers and no more wiggle room for Tehran to line its pockets.\n\"If our policy objective is to \u2018go to zero,' our policymakers should go to zero,\" the source said. \"There's no excuse not to when global oil markets have more than enough spare capacity to offset the loss of all Iranian oil supply.\"\nOne veteran Iran policy hand familiar with the battle between Congress and the State Department blamed officials at the State Department for working to undermine Trump's policy toward Iran.\n\"There's an old as dirt expression in Washington D.C., which is that Democrats organize and Republicans atomize,\" said the source, who would only speak on background. \"What it means is that it's impossible to unify any significant group of congressional Republicans around any significant issue. Yet somehow the pro-waivers team at the State Department has managed to do it.\"\nAdam Kredo is senior writer reporting on national security and foreign policy matters for the Washington Free Beacon.

It has a range of about 620 miles, which means it would have to be launched from a ship or submarine very close to the U.S. east or west coast if it were to be fired at targets in the continental United States, according to Russian weapons design specialists who spoke to the <em>Washington Free Beacon</em>.</p>\n<p>David Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.</p>\n<p>Sign up here and stay informed!</p>\n<p>&quot;In a wartime situation, no Russian naval vessel could approach this close to the U.S. and still survive, so the only interpretation is that Tsirkon is now being planned as a first strike weapon. The only plausible scenario is one in which these ships or subs would approach an unsuspecting U.S. coastline and then the Tsirkons would be launched in a surprise attack,&quot; said one expert.</p>\n<p>Dmitry Kiselyov, host of Russia's &quot;News of the Week,&quot; outlined the targets that the missile would be used against on his weekly TV show. Kiselyov has garnered international attention for a series of bombastic statements, which include telling his audience in March 2014 that the world should be grateful for the fact that &quot;Russia is the only country in the world that is realistically capable of turning the United States into radioactive ash.&quot;</p>\n<p>The targets, according to Kiselyov, are some of the main U.S. strategic command centers, as well as those installations where in a time of crisis senior U.S. government staff would be relocated in order to maintain the continuity of government. These include the Pentagon, Camp David, and Fort Ritchie on the east coast and McClellan Air Force Base and Jim Creek, a central U.S. Navy communications station in Washington, on the west coast.</p>\n<p>Kiselyov said the Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missile could hit these targets in less than five minutes if launched from submarines.</p>\n<p>It is unclear how realistic the statements of Putin or Kiselyov are&mdash;and how soon the Tsirkon missile could be prepared for deployment.</p>\n<p>Putin said the development costs for the Tsirkon would be minimized because it is compatible with the Novator-made Kalibr cruise missiles already installed on Russian ships and submarines. However, Novator are made at a completely separate design facility, so claims of &quot;compatibility&quot; between the two missile systems are dubious.</p>\n<p>Some observers say the decision to highlight the Tsirkon being employed against high-value targets is not a new and bold move by the Russian military. One former Russian military aerospace designer said, &quot;these sites have long been on the first priority target lists for the Russian ICBM fleet and have always been set for destruction by Russia's nuclear forces.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;But, Kiselyov now waving the flag and publicly identifying these command centers makes it look like Russia is now safer and more capably defended&mdash;as well as on the offensive&mdash;in a way not previously seen,&quot; he continued.</p>\n<p>&quot;It is another example of this Kremlin propaganda team pumping up Putin's image&mdash;and making it look like these wonder weapons that do not even really exist were only capable of being built because of Putin's &lsquo;decisive and fearless leadership.'&quot;</p>\n<p>Mark Schneider, a former Pentagon policymaker involved in nuclear arms, said the threat by Putin was unprecedented. &quot;This is Putin&rsquo;s first nuclear targeting threat directed specifically against the U.S.,&quot; Schneider told the <em>Washington Times</em>.</p>\n<p>Dmitry Peskov, Russian presidential spokesman, sought to clarify Putin's comments following the Russian television report identifying targets. The comment, however, appeared to confirm the Russian leader's threat.</p>\n<p>&quot;The president said that if our country is under threat and intermediate and shorter range missiles are deployed near its borders, a proportionate response will have to be made and our missiles targeted not only at the launchers, but at the territories where the center of decision-making is located. Please remember that the president did not mention a single geographic name in this connection,&quot; Peskov said on Monday, according to the state-run TASS news agency.</p>\n<p>Peskov made the comment when asked about the Rossiya-1 television report identifying targets. &quot;We never intervene in the editorial policies of our television channels, even government-run ones, and we cannot do so,&quot; he added.</p>\n<p>The Russian leader in his address made the threatening comments stating that Russia would take proportionate and asymmetrical measures if the United States deploys intermediate-range and short-range missiles in Europe and insisted Russian would not be the first to deploy this type of weapon.</p>\n<p>The United States has withdrawn from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia based on Moscow deploying a new ground-launched cruise missile, the SCC-8, in violation of the treaty that bans missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles.</p>\n<p><strong>Reuben F.

                "text": "KIEV, Ukraine\u2014News reports from Russian media over the weekend indicate that the hypersonic cruise missile highlighted in President Vladimir Putin's Feb. 20 state of the nation address is being contemplated for use in a first strike against targets in the continental United States.\nThis was the second year in a row that the Russian leader used the occasion of his annual presentation to a joint session of the Russian state parliament to threaten the use of nuclear-capable, \"doomsday\" weapons against the United States.\nPutin highlighted the NPO Mashinostroyeniya 3M22 Tsirkon missile. It has a range of about 620 miles, which means it would have to be launched from a ship or submarine very close to the U.S. east or west coast if it were to be fired at targets in the continental United States, according to Russian weapons design specialists who spoke to the Washington Free Beacon.\nDavid Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.\nSign up here and stay informed!\n\"In a wartime situation, no Russian naval vessel could approach this close to the U.S. and still survive, so the only interpretation is that Tsirkon is now being planned as a first strike weapon. The only plausible scenario is one in which these ships or subs would approach an unsuspecting U.S. coastline and then the Tsirkons would be launched in a surprise attack,\" said one expert.\nDmitry Kiselyov, host of Russia's \"News of the Week,\" outlined the targets that the missile would be used against on his weekly TV show. Kiselyov has garnered international attention for a series of bombastic statements, which include telling his audience in March 2014 that the world should be grateful for the fact that \"Russia is the only country in the world that is realistically capable of turning the United States into radioactive ash.\"\nThe targets, according to Kiselyov, are some of the main U.S. strategic command centers, as well as those installations where in a time of crisis senior U.S. government staff would be relocated in order to maintain the continuity of government. These include the Pentagon, Camp David, and Fort Ritchie on the east coast and McClellan Air Force Base and Jim Creek, a central U.S. Navy communications station in Washington, on the west coast.\nKiselyov said the Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missile could hit these targets in less than five minutes if launched from submarines.\nIt is unclear how realistic the statements of Putin or Kiselyov are\u2014and how soon the Tsirkon missile could be prepared for deployment.\nPutin said the development costs for the Tsirkon would be minimized because it is compatible with the Novator-made Kalibr cruise missiles already installed on Russian ships and submarines. However, Novator are made at a completely separate design facility, so claims of \"compatibility\" between the two missile systems are dubious.\nSome observers say the decision to highlight the Tsirkon being employed against high-value targets is not a new and bold move by the Russian military. One former Russian military aerospace designer said, \"these sites have long been on the first priority target lists for the Russian ICBM fleet and have always been set for destruction by Russia's nuclear forces.\"\n\"But, Kiselyov now waving the flag and publicly identifying these command centers makes it look like Russia is now safer and more capably defended\u2014as well as on the offensive\u2014in a way not previously seen,\" he continued.\n\"It is another example of this Kremlin propaganda team pumping up Putin's image\u2014and making it look like these wonder weapons that do not even really exist were only capable of being built because of Putin's \u2018decisive and fearless leadership.'\"\nMark Schneider, a former Pentagon policymaker involved in nuclear arms, said the threat by Putin was unprecedented. \"This is Putin\u2019s first nuclear targeting threat directed specifically against the U.S.,\" Schneider told the Washington Times.\nDmitry Peskov, Russian presidential spokesman, sought to clarify Putin's comments following the Russian television report identifying targets. The comment, however, appeared to confirm the Russian leader's threat.\n\"The president said that if our country is under threat and intermediate and shorter range missiles are deployed near its borders, a proportionate response will have to be made and our missiles targeted not only at the launchers, but at the territories where the center of decision-making is located. Please remember that the president did not mention a single geographic name in this connection,\" Peskov said on Monday, according to the state-run TASS news agency.\nPeskov made the comment when asked about the Rossiya-1 television report identifying targets. \"We never intervene in the editorial policies of our television channels, even government-run ones, and we cannot do so,\" he added.\nThe Russian leader in his address made the threatening comments stating that Russia would take proportionate and asymmetrical measures if the United States deploys intermediate-range and short-range missiles in Europe and insisted Russian would not be the first to deploy this type of weapon.\nThe United States has withdrawn from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia based on Moscow deploying a new ground-launched cruise missile, the SCC-8, in violation of the treaty that bans missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles.\nReuben F. Johnson writes frequently on defense issues for the Washington Free Beacon and for several leading defense publications worldwide. He has also consulted for the Office of Net Assessment.

David Valadao wasn't decided until weeks after Election Day, and was won by less than a thousand votes, suggesting his hold on the seat is likely tenuous in a district in California's San Joaquin Valley.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/exclusive-congressman-cox-fires-back-at-reports-over-his-financial-records-during-the-campaign/1922575618\">interview</a> on local television station KSEE that aired over the weekend comes as the largest paper in his congressional district has published a string of articles raising questions about some of the congressman's business dealings, taxes, and financial disclosures.</p>\n<p>David Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.</p>\n<p>Sign up here and stay informed!</p>\n<p>The latest of those <a href=\"https://www.fresnobee.com/news/politics-government/article229074824.html\">articles</a>, published early Tuesday morning by the McClatchy-owned <em>Fresno Bee</em>, said Cox &quot;has a complicated financial history that includes multiple tax liens and a delinquent debt that caused the Fresno County Sheriff's Office to warn him that it could seize his property.&quot;</p>\n<p>The nonprofit under scrutiny, the Central Valley Community Sports Foundation (CVCSF) was begun in 2015 by local developer Terance Frazier, primarily to run a city sports park that has had a troubled history. Cox was the foundation's treasurer from its inception.</p>\n<p>Under the arrangement between the CVCSF and the city, the nonprofit pledged $2.7 million in upgrades to the outdoor sports park and would take over the yearly management. The city would pay the CVCSF $150,000 per year for the management, slightly less than what the government had been allocating in their own budget.</p>\n<p>However, last August, Frazier approached the city to increase its financial contribution, which then triggered a clause in the contract allowing the city to perform an <a href=\"https://www.fresno.gov/finance/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/2019-02-CVCSF-Granite-Park-Audit-Report.pdf\">audit</a>, and a <em>Bee</em> <a href=\"https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article217999125.html\">article</a> shortly after raised questions about how much investment had actually occurred.</p>\n<p>&quot;During the initial review, Internal Audit determined that CVCSF's internal controls were deficient to nonexistent,&quot; one of the <a href=\"https://www.fresno.gov/finance/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/2019-02-CVCSF-Granite-Park-Audit-Report.pdf\">findings</a> read. Other conclusions by the audit team found the nonprofit's checkbook was not balanced correctly, contracts were sometimes made verbally, and multiple payments had been made to &quot;corporate officers&quot; of the nonprofit that were questionable.</p>\n<p>&quot;In February 2017, two Corporate Officers of CVCSF withdrew $145,140.76 and $75,000 respectively as &lsquo;loan repayments,'&quot; it noted. &quot;However, these withdrawals were made before there was evidence that the individuals had provided any such loans to the non-profit.&quot;</p>\n<p>It's not clear if Cox was one of the corporate officers mentioned.</p>\n<p>Cox had not provided substantive comment about the audit to media requests from multiple outlets <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/politics/rep-cox-continues-to-dodge-questions-on-compromising-audit/\">including</a> the <em>Washington Free Beacon</em>, but finally addressed the issues with KSEE in an interview that aired Sunday.</p>\n<p>&quot;There's a&mdash;to a certain extent&mdash;no good deed goes unpunished,&quot; Cox began. &quot;You know, that was a site, as you know, I mean it was 20 acres of wheat. It was a public nuisance. It was a homeless encampment. Right?

                "text": "California Democratic representative T.J. Cox broke several weeks of silence on an audit from February that blasted a nonprofit for which he served as treasurer, with the congressman seemingly irritated when suggesting there's been a lack of gratitude for what the nonprofit has done.\nCox's victory last November over incumbent Republican Rep. David Valadao wasn't decided until weeks after Election Day, and was won by less than a thousand votes, suggesting his hold on the seat is likely tenuous in a district in California's San Joaquin Valley.\nAn interview on local television station KSEE that aired over the weekend comes as the largest paper in his congressional district has published a string of articles raising questions about some of the congressman's business dealings, taxes, and financial disclosures.\nDavid Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.\nSign up here and stay informed!\nThe latest of those articles, published early Tuesday morning by the McClatchy-owned Fresno Bee, said Cox \"has a complicated financial history that includes multiple tax liens and a delinquent debt that caused the Fresno County Sheriff's Office to warn him that it could seize his property.\"\nThe nonprofit under scrutiny, the Central Valley Community Sports Foundation (CVCSF) was begun in 2015 by local developer Terance Frazier, primarily to run a city sports park that has had a troubled history. Cox was the foundation's treasurer from its inception.\nUnder the arrangement between the CVCSF and the city, the nonprofit pledged $2.7 million in upgrades to the outdoor sports park and would take over the yearly management. The city would pay the CVCSF $150,000 per year for the management, slightly less than what the government had been allocating in their own budget.\nHowever, last August, Frazier approached the city to increase its financial contribution, which then triggered a clause in the contract allowing the city to perform an audit, and a Bee article shortly after raised questions about how much investment had actually occurred.\n\"During the initial review, Internal Audit determined that CVCSF's internal controls were deficient to nonexistent,\" one of the findings read. Other conclusions by the audit team found the nonprofit's checkbook was not balanced correctly, contracts were sometimes made verbally, and multiple payments had been made to \"corporate officers\" of the nonprofit that were questionable.\n\"In February 2017, two Corporate Officers of CVCSF withdrew $145,140.76 and $75,000 respectively as \u2018loan repayments,'\" it noted. \"However, these withdrawals were made before there was evidence that the individuals had provided any such loans to the non-profit.\"\nIt's not clear if Cox was one of the corporate officers mentioned.\nCox had not provided substantive comment about the audit to media requests from multiple outlets including the Washington Free Beacon, but finally addressed the issues with KSEE in an interview that aired Sunday.\n\"There's a\u2014to a certain extent\u2014no good deed goes unpunished,\" Cox began. \"You know, that was a site, as you know, I mean it was 20 acres of wheat. It was a public nuisance. It was a homeless encampment. Right? And Terance came along with assistance from me, and they turned it into this public recreational facility, at no risk to the city, no cost to the city, right? Less than they were spending before. That's being used by thousands of people every day, right?\"\n\"I kind of just wish that they would just say \u2018Thank you so much for what you've done,' right, to make this available to the city.\"\nFor more than six weeks, the Washington Free Beacon has made several unsuccessful attempts to obtain a copy of the 2017 IRS 990 form for the CVCSF, a document that is essentially the tax return for the nonprofit and supposed to be available by law.\nA document from March shows the congressman severed his ties with the CVCSF that month, and the Fresno County district attorney's office has launched an investigation into the audit as well.\nTwo weeks ago, the Fresno Bee published a story noting that Cox \"failed to disclose several business interests during his most recent congressional candidacies, including the fact that he sits on the board of a for-profit Canadian mining company[.]\"\nCox complained to KSEE that the Bee's reporting omitted information, but his response was also less than straightforward.\n\"What they forgot to tell you is, any of these things\u2014and there wasn't any of them where\u2014one, they were already shut down, had no assets or revenues. That's uh, that would've been a very pertinent piece of information.\"\nCox's congressional office did not respond to requests by the Beacon for a clarification on those remarks.\nThe same report also raised questions about whether he had disclosed possible rental income on a home in Fresno, and the congressman's office did not respond to the Bee's questions on those issues.\nIn the KSEE interview, Cox indicated he thought the article was implying that he had skirted disclosure laws, and called it \"inaccurate.\"\n\"If a news organization has some kind of agenda, I can't worry about that,\" he said.\nThe most recent report by the Bee, which came after the television interview, breaks new ground on other business dealings already receiving scrutiny.\n\"Some of his financial entanglements were reported during his 2018 congressional campaign, including an IRS lien against him and his wife,\" the report said. \"McClatchy has obtained new records showing that the Fresno County Sheriff's Office was involved in collecting an arbitration payment five years ago, as well as recent liens against two of his companies.\"\nCox's office did not respond to a request for comment on the newest article by the Bee.\nWhen asked about the disclosure issues, the audit, and whether the congressman provided information to the Bee on stories he claims omitted key information, Cox's office only response was to point to an article also in the Bee. That report noted the Fresno city attorney said the CVCSF was continuing to meet its contractual obligations to the city.\nHis 2018 campaign was based in large part on promoting a track record of business success. He has also been a vocal supporter of legislation introduced by the newly Democrat-controlled House that seeks to ratchet up financial disclosure laws for members of congress and candidates.\nTodd Shepherd is a former staff writer for the Washington Free Beacon.

Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar / Getty Images </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Democratic representatives Ilhan Omar (Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) both saw spikes in campaign contributions as they battled accusations of anti-Semitism, Federal Election Commission filings show.</p>\n<p>The freshman duo, particularly Omar, have found themselves in hot water over the past two months. During a &quot;progressive town hall&quot; on <a href=\"https://www.busboysandpoets.com/events/th-evt-8030940/\">Feb. 27</a> at Busboys and Poets in Washington, D.C., Omar remarked on the &quot;political influence&quot; in the United States &quot;that says it's OK to push allegiance to a foreign country&quot; while speaking in relation to Israel. Tlaib was at the event alongside Omar.</p>\n<p>Senior Democratic officials were forced to rebuke Omar over the comments, and House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot Engel (D., N.Y), who is Jewish, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/03/04/700163118/democrats-planning-another-public-rebuke-of-rep-ilhan-omar\">called the remarks</a> a &quot;vile anti-Semitic slur.&quot;</p>\n<p>David Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.</p>\n<p>Sign up here and stay informed!</p>\n<p>Prior to the event, Omar found herself under fire for a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/11/ilhan-omar-anti-semitism-allegation/2836508002/\">tweet</a> in which she claimed the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) was funding her critics. Omar pushed back against her Democratic colleagues following the event and has continued to make such remarks publicly.</p>\n<p>Despite, or perhaps because of, the controversy over her comments, Omar and Tlaib (the latter regularly defends Omar's remarks), both saw spikes in campaign contributions, filings show.</p>\n<p>Throughout the first quarter of the year, which spans from Jan. 1 to March 31, Omar's campaign pulled <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/444/201904159146360444/201904159146360444.pdf\">$822,024.29</a> in contributions from individuals, $414,000 of which came from small donors, or individuals providing less than $200 in total contributions to the campaign.</p>\n<p>Most of the money was raised by the campaign following the Feb. 27 event that led to a stream of public headaches for Democrats. Omar's campaign hauled in just $24,331 in contributions in January while taking in $115,007 in donations in February&mdash;$23,360 of which came the day after the D.C. townhall event with Tlaib.</p>\n<p>However, throughout March the congresswoman hauled in $265,429 in donations, according to an analysis of her campaign records.</p>\n<p>Three of Omar's biggest days this year all came in March. On March 29, the campaign was given $49,400; on March 5 the campaign reported $45,397; and on March 27, the committee saw $29,360 in donations.</p>\n<p>A closer look at the data reveals a notable jump in contributions to Omar in the period specifically following her and Tlaib's Busboys and Poets appearance. In the pre-appearance period, she raised an average of $6,443 per day; after her appearance, that figure jumps to $11,552 per day on average.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/omar1.png\"></img></figure>\n<p>Tlaib also experienced a drastic increase in campaign contributions at the same time as Omar.</p>\n<p>Federal Election Commission filings show that Tlaib's campaign received <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/818/201904149146125818/201904149146125818.pdf\">$313,317.65</a> in individual contributions, $70,000 of which came from small donors. Tlaib's campaign committee pulled in just $36,430 combined throughout January and February.</p>\n<p>However, the congresswoman was the recipient of $206,817 in campaign contributions from individuals throughout March. Like Omar, Tlaib's three biggest days in terms of campaign contribution hauls all came last month when the committee took in $53,450 on March 10, $30,305 on March 25, and $29,920 on March 28.</p>\n<p>The data show that Tlaib's receipts show an even more dramatic increase following the Busboys and Poets appearance than Omar's do. In the pre-appearance period, she averaged just $1,179 per day in contributions; after the appearance, that figure rises to $7,146, driven by a number of major March appearances.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/tlaib1.png\"></img></figure>\n<p>The lion's share of Omar's funding comes not from her home state of Minnesota, which gave her just under $10,000 in the first three months of 2019, but from Massachusetts. The Bay State gave her $84,610 pre-appearance. But after she rose to national attention, residents nearly doubled that number, giving $165,667 in the post-appearance period.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/0.png\"></img></figure>\n<p>Tlaib received little money before her rise to prominence; her best source was Illinoisans, who gave her $11,900 in the lead-up to her comments. But national attention netted her national donors, including $35,375 from New Yorkers and $140,712 from residents of California.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/0-1.png\"></img></figure>\n<p>Omar's and Tlaib's campaigns did not respond to requests for comments by press time.</p>",

                "text": "Democratic representatives Ilhan Omar (Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) both saw spikes in campaign contributions as they battled accusations of anti-Semitism, Federal Election Commission filings show.\nThe freshman duo, particularly Omar, have found themselves in hot water over the past two months. During a \"progressive town hall\" on Feb. 27 at Busboys and Poets in Washington, D.C., Omar remarked on the \"political influence\" in the United States \"that says it's OK to push allegiance to a foreign country\" while speaking in relation to Israel. Tlaib was at the event alongside Omar.\nSenior Democratic officials were forced to rebuke Omar over the comments, and House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot Engel (D., N.Y), who is Jewish, called the remarks a \"vile anti-Semitic slur.\"\nDavid Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.\nSign up here and stay informed!\nPrior to the event, Omar found herself under fire for a tweet in which she claimed the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) was funding her critics. Omar pushed back against her Democratic colleagues following the event and has continued to make such remarks publicly.\nDespite, or perhaps because of, the controversy over her comments, Omar and Tlaib (the latter regularly defends Omar's remarks), both saw spikes in campaign contributions, filings show.\nThroughout the first quarter of the year, which spans from Jan. 1 to March 31, Omar's campaign pulled $822,024.29 in contributions from individuals, $414,000 of which came from small donors, or individuals providing less than $200 in total contributions to the campaign.\nMost of the money was raised by the campaign following the Feb. 27 event that led to a stream of public headaches for Democrats. Omar's campaign hauled in just $24,331 in contributions in January while taking in $115,007 in donations in February\u2014$23,360 of which came the day after the D.C. townhall event with Tlaib.\nHowever, throughout March the congresswoman hauled in $265,429 in donations, according to an analysis of her campaign records.\nThree of Omar's biggest days this year all came in March. On March 29, the campaign was given $49,400; on March 5 the campaign reported $45,397; and on March 27, the committee saw $29,360 in donations.\nA closer look at the data reveals a notable jump in contributions to Omar in the period specifically following her and Tlaib's Busboys and Poets appearance. In the pre-appearance period, she raised an average of $6,443 per day; after her appearance, that figure jumps to $11,552 per day on average.\nTlaib also experienced a drastic increase in campaign contributions at the same time as Omar.\nFederal Election Commission filings show that Tlaib's campaign received $313,317.65 in individual contributions, $70,000 of which came from small donors. Tlaib's campaign committee pulled in just $36,430 combined throughout January and February.\nHowever, the congresswoman was the recipient of $206,817 in campaign contributions from individuals throughout March. Like Omar, Tlaib's three biggest days in terms of campaign contribution hauls all came last month when the committee took in $53,450 on March 10, $30,305 on March 25, and $29,920 on March 28.\nThe data show that Tlaib's receipts show an even more dramatic increase following the Busboys and Poets appearance than Omar's do. In the pre-appearance period, she averaged just $1,179 per day in contributions; after the appearance, that figure rises to $7,146, driven by a number of major March appearances.\nThe lion's share of Omar's funding comes not from her home state of Minnesota, which gave her just under $10,000 in the first three months of 2019, but from Massachusetts. The Bay State gave her $84,610 pre-appearance. But after she rose to national attention, residents nearly doubled that number, giving $165,667 in the post-appearance period.\nTlaib received little money before her rise to prominence; her best source was Illinoisans, who gave her $11,900 in the lead-up to her comments.

Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) saved roughly $38,000 in taxes thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Republican-passed tax cut championed by President Donald Trump which the <em>New York Times </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/business/economy/income-tax-cut.html\">recently admitted</a> cut most Americans' taxes.</p>\n<p>Sanders released ten years' worth of <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/tax-returns/\">tax returns</a> Monday night, fulfilling a long-standing promise to do so. The returns <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/14/us/politics/2020-candidates-tax-returns.html\">indicated</a> that Sanders is now a millionaire, having collected more than $1 million in 2016 and 2017 thanks to the sales from his books <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Our-Revolution-Believe-Bernie-Sanders/dp/1250132924/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_3/139-0641429-4742954?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1250132924&pd_rd_r=4f4c68e8-606d-11e9-b2ef-bb2ae37525d6&pd_rd_w=PQgmB&pd_rd_wg=hwjEJ&pf_rd_p=a2006322-0bc0-4db9-a08e-d168c18ce6f0&pf_rd_r=GBF0CJ8SW7CVJ1385RNC&psc=1&refRID=GBF0CJ8SW7CVJ1385RNC\"><em>Our Revolution</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bernie-Sanders-Guide-Political-Revolution/dp/1250138906\"><em>Bernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Sanders <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/politics/sanders-gets-combative-on-wealth-tax-martha-why-dont-you-give-you-make-more-money-than-i-do/\">dodged questions</a> about his new-found wealth during a Monday night townhall on Fox, declining to say if he would pay a top tax rate of 52 percent, the highest bracket proposed during his 2016 run for the White House. He also did not respond to a question from Fox's Martha MacCallum about if he would <a href=\"https://fiscal.treasury.gov/public/gifts-to-government.html\">voluntarily give</a> money to the government to bring his tax bill up to what he thought a fair rate was.</p>\n<p>David Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.</p>\n<p>Sign up here and stay informed!</p>\n<p>If he did, or if his tax plan were implemented, Sanders would increase his tax liability by nearly 30 percent, analysis of his tax returns indicates.</p>\n<p>Sanders has not announced any substantive changes to the income tax system during his 2020 run. However, during his 2016 run, Sanders floated a comprehensive overhaul to the tax system in order to help pay for his proposed Medicare-for-All plan.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/details-and-analysis-senator-bernie-sanders-s-tax-plan/\">analysis</a> from the right-leaning Tax Foundation, Sanders's 2016 proposal would add four new top tax brackets with rates of 37 percent, 43 percent, 48 percent, and 52 percent, It would also add a 2.2 percent &quot;income-based [health care] premium paid by households,&quot; which the Tax Foundation writers say is &quot;equivalent to increasing all tax bracket rates by 2.2 percentage points.&quot;</p>\n<p>Using the Tax Foundation's estimates of Sanders's brackets, as well as the senator's reported 2018 taxable income of $519,529, we can estimate a total tax liability under his schema of $170,240.11. If Sanders were paying taxes under his own plan, he would be shelling out an additional $36,819.11 to the government, and have a tax liability of 32.7 percent of his income.</p>\n<p>Luckily for his finances, Sanders does not live under his own tax regime.

                "text": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) saved roughly $38,000 in taxes thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Republican-passed tax cut championed by President Donald Trump which the New York Times recently admitted cut most Americans' taxes.\nSanders released ten years' worth of tax returns Monday night, fulfilling a long-standing promise to do so. The returns indicated that Sanders is now a millionaire, having collected more than $1 million in 2016 and 2017 thanks to the sales from his books Our Revolution and Bernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution.\nSanders dodged questions about his new-found wealth during a Monday night townhall on Fox, declining to say if he would pay a top tax rate of 52 percent, the highest bracket proposed during his 2016 run for the White House. He also did not respond to a question from Fox's Martha MacCallum about if he would voluntarily give money to the government to bring his tax bill up to what he thought a fair rate was.\nDavid Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.\nSign up here and stay informed!\nIf he did, or if his tax plan were implemented, Sanders would increase his tax liability by nearly 30 percent, analysis of his tax returns indicates.\nSanders has not announced any substantive changes to the income tax system during his 2020 run. However, during his 2016 run, Sanders floated a comprehensive overhaul to the tax system in order to help pay for his proposed Medicare-for-All plan.\nAccording to analysis from the right-leaning Tax Foundation, Sanders's 2016 proposal would add four new top tax brackets with rates of 37 percent, 43 percent, 48 percent, and 52 percent, It would also add a 2.2 percent \"income-based [health care] premium paid by households,\" which the Tax Foundation writers say is \"equivalent to increasing all tax bracket rates by 2.2 percentage points.\"\nUsing the Tax Foundation's estimates of Sanders's brackets, as well as the senator's reported 2018 taxable income of $519,529, we can estimate a total tax liability under his schema of $170,240.11. If Sanders were paying taxes under his own plan, he would be shelling out an additional $36,819.11 to the government, and have a tax liability of 32.7 percent of his income.\nLuckily for his finances, Sanders does not live under his own tax regime. Rather, Sanders enjoyed a tax cut thanks to the TCJA, just like millions of other Americans.\n\"Ever since President Trump signed the Republican-sponsored tax bill in December 2017, independent analyses have consistently found that a large majority of Americans would owe less because of the law,\" New York Times reporters Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley wrote on Sunday. \"Preliminary data based on tax filings has shown the same.\"\nMultiple tax-policy think tanks have provided tools to estimate tax liability with and without the TCJA.

                "text": "The reelection campaigns for two freshman Democratic members of the House, Reps. Lucy McBath (D., Ga.) and Jahana Hayes (D., Conn.), failed to disclose large contributions received from the campaign of fellow freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.).\nThe contributions were revealed in Omar's most recent filing, which disclosed transfers of $2,000 to both McBath and Hayes on March 27 of this year. Neither the filing from McBath nor from Hayes discloses the payments from their Minnesota colleague.\nReps. Lauren Underwood (D., Ill.) and Haley Stevens (D., Mich.) also received contributions from Omar, on March 27 and March 28, respectively. Both Underwood and Stevens included the contributions in their first quarter fundraising reports.\nDavid Rutz breaks down the most important news about the enemies of freedom, here and around the world, in this comprehensive morning newsletter.\nSign up here and stay informed!\nUnderwood has already paid the price for her disclosure, with a national Republican group saying her acceptance of the donation serves as her acceptance of anti-Semitism.\n\"By accepting her campaign cash, Lauren Underwood has made clear the reason she won't condemn Ilhan Omar's vile anti-Semitic rhetoric is because she doesn't have a problem with it,\" said Carly Atchison, spokeswoman for the National Republican Campaign Committee\nReached by phone, the Hayes campaign said the contribution would be included in its next fundraising report, when it received the check from Omar's campaign. Spokeswoman Barbara Ellis said there was \"absolutely not\" an effort to hide the contribution.\nThe McBath campaign would not comment on why Omar's contribution wasn't in its fundraising report, but said the \"report is accurate.\"\nCampaigns generally attempt to squeeze as many contributions as possible into their coffers as each quarter comes to a close.\nOmar raised over $800,000 in her first quarter as a congresswoman. Contributions flooded in following uproar caused by anti-Semitic remarks, according to a Washington Free Beacon investigation.\nBrent Scher is executive editor for the Washington Free Beacon.

Larry Hogan said he hasn&rsquo;t <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/i-havent-abandoned-my-principles-hogan-pondering-challenge-to-trump-casts-himself-as-a-traditional-republican/2019/03/17/3862b274-48d3-11e9-9663-00ac73f49662_story.html\">decided</a> whether to challenge President Trump in 2020, but he might just want to sit this one out, according to political analysts and poll data.</p>\n<p>Hogan, 62, is extremely popular in his traditionally blue state. He boasts a 69 percent approval rating, and he won re-election in 2018 by double digits over challenger Ben Jealous.</p>\n<p>His unique success in Maryland and his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/larry-hogan-the-chance-of-trump-losing-a-general-election-in-2020-is-pretty-good\">public opposition to the president</a> has led to intense speculation about his political future and whether he could pose a serious threat to Trump, whose own approval ratings have remained tepid throughout his presidency. Hogan has fueled those talks by publicly mulling a primary challenge.</p>\n<p>But Hogan would face a far tougher audience outside of Maryland and in the GOP primary states, where voters are less likely to back someone with his moderate record on gun control, abortion, and other key Republican issues.</p>\n<p>He would also be facing off against Trump, whose approval rating among Republicans remains at 90 percent, despite the party&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/byron-york-dems-hard-left-turn-poses-dilemma-for-nevertrumpers\">vocal Never Trump faction</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Can he win the nomination? No,&rdquo; said Cook Political Report editor Jennifer Duffy, in an interview with the <i>Washington Examiner</i>. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s far too moderate, frankly, to win a nomination in a Republican primary as the party stands right now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hogan, in a Washington Post interview this week, said he would not make a decision about whether to challenge Trump until the fall, after the likely conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.</p>\n<p>Hogan suggested in the interview that findings damaging to Trump could push him into the race.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Of course you couldn&rsquo;t win a Republican primary challenge today,&rdquo; Hogan said. &ldquo;But I also have been around long enough to know that things can change very rapidly. ... A lot can happen all spring and summer and into the fall.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><i>[<b>Read more:</b> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/larry-hogan-lapping-up-2020-attention-but-wont-commit-to-kamikaze-mission-just-to-wound-trump\">Larry Hogan not interested in 'kamikaze mission' against Trump</a>]</i></p>\n<p>Barring a blockbuster report from Mueller, Hogan would appear to stand no chance against Trump.</p>\n<p>History is on Trump's side. Republican incumbents have won three out of every four elections, Ford O&rsquo;Connell, a GOP strategist, told the <i>Washington Examiner</i>.</p>\n<p>Trump is also wildly popular with his core supporters, and if he were somehow dropped from the ticket, O&rsquo;Connell said, many of those voters would stay home in November 2020.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And nobody has the type of enthusiasm necessary among the Republican base,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Connell said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about intensity. Donald Trump gives you the best chance to win the White House.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump also has the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/rnc-expected-to-reaffirm-support-for-trump-resolution-may-have-backing-of-chairwoman\">unwavering support of the Republican National Committee</a> and the organization&rsquo;s immense resources and money that almost any GOP candidate would need in order to win the White House.</p>\n<p>Hogan would almost certainly win the backing of the GOP&rsquo;s influential anti-Trump faction, which is hoping a credible Republican jumps into the race to challenge the president.</p>\n<p>Former Gov. William Weld, a former Libertarian who supported President Barack Obama, said he will challenge Trump but has so far barely registered in polls. Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran unsuccessfully in 2016, said he is also considering another bid for the White House but has not made a decision and also gets clobbered in primary surveys against Trump.</p>\n<p>The trio of governors have frequently criticized Trump and remain popular alternatives among Never Trump Republicans, despite the long odds.</p>\n<p>Hogan often reminds people his lawmaker father, Rep. Lawrence J. Hogan, was among the first in the GOP to call for President Richard Nixon&rsquo;s impeachment.</p>\n<p>But not even Marylanders want Hogan to run, according to a February poll by Gaucher College.</p>\n<p>Only a third of Maryland residents said he should run for president, while 55 were against it, the poll found.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Voters never want their governor to run for another office,&rdquo; said Duffy, who analyzes governors&rsquo; races for Cook. &ldquo;They just re-elected him. They are happy with the way his is governing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Goucher College Poll Director Mileah Kromer told the <i>Washington Examiner</i> that while it would be &ldquo;extremely difficult&rdquo; for any GOP candidate to beat Trump in a primary, the Mueller report findings, if significant, could change that.</p>\n<p>And Hogan would be in position to challenge Trump.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/fb/7a/ede05107427bb54bdcf2536c6b51/loading.gif\"></img></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;Hogan would have the advantage of having a record of political experience that is fully independent of and distinct from President Trump,&rdquo; Kromer said. &ldquo;He could run as the un-Trump Republican &mdash; and if there's something damaging enough to shake the GOP base in the Mueller report, that might be appealing to Republican voters.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said he hasn\u2019t decided whether to challenge President Trump in 2020, but he might just want to sit this one out, according to political analysts and poll data.\nHogan, 62, is extremely popular in his traditionally blue state. He boasts a 69 percent approval rating, and he won re-election in 2018 by double digits over challenger Ben Jealous.\nHis unique success in Maryland and his public opposition to the president has led to intense speculation about his political future and whether he could pose a serious threat to Trump, whose own approval ratings have remained tepid throughout his presidency. Hogan has fueled those talks by publicly mulling a primary challenge.\nBut Hogan would face a far tougher audience outside of Maryland and in the GOP primary states, where voters are less likely to back someone with his moderate record on gun control, abortion, and other key Republican issues.\nHe would also be facing off against Trump, whose approval rating among Republicans remains at 90 percent, despite the party\u2019s vocal Never Trump faction.\n\u201cCan he win the nomination? No,\u201d said Cook Political Report editor Jennifer Duffy, in an interview with the Washington Examiner. \u201cHe\u2019s far too moderate, frankly, to win a nomination in a Republican primary as the party stands right now.\u201d\nHogan, in a Washington Post interview this week, said he would not make a decision about whether to challenge Trump until the fall, after the likely conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.\nHogan suggested in the interview that findings damaging to Trump could push him into the race.\n\u201cOf course you couldn\u2019t win a Republican primary challenge today,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cBut I also have been around long enough to know that things can change very rapidly. ... A lot can happen all spring and summer and into the fall.\u201d\n[Read more: Larry Hogan not interested in 'kamikaze mission' against Trump]\nBarring a blockbuster report from Mueller, Hogan would appear to stand no chance against Trump.\nHistory is on Trump's side. Republican incumbents have won three out of every four elections, Ford O\u2019Connell, a GOP strategist, told the Washington Examiner.\nTrump is also wildly popular with his core supporters, and if he were somehow dropped from the ticket, O\u2019Connell said, many of those voters would stay home in November 2020.\n\u201cAnd nobody has the type of enthusiasm necessary among the Republican base,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cIt\u2019s about intensity. Donald Trump gives you the best chance to win the White House.\u201d\nTrump also has the unwavering support of the Republican National Committee and the organization\u2019s immense resources and money that almost any GOP candidate would need in order to win the White House.\nHogan would almost certainly win the backing of the GOP\u2019s influential anti-Trump faction, which is hoping a credible Republican jumps into the race to challenge the president.\nFormer Gov. William Weld, a former Libertarian who supported President Barack Obama, said he will challenge Trump but has so far barely registered in polls. Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran unsuccessfully in 2016, said he is also considering another bid for the White House but has not made a decision and also gets clobbered in primary surveys against Trump.\nThe trio of governors have frequently criticized Trump and remain popular alternatives among Never Trump Republicans, despite the long odds.\nHogan often reminds people his lawmaker father, Rep. Lawrence J. Hogan, was among the first in the GOP to call for President Richard Nixon\u2019s impeachment.\nBut not even Marylanders want Hogan to run, according to a February poll by Gaucher College.\nOnly a third of Maryland residents said he should run for president, while 55 were against it, the poll found.\n\u201cVoters never want their governor to run for another office,\u201d said Duffy, who analyzes governors\u2019 races for Cook. \u201cThey just re-elected him. They are happy with the way his is governing.\u201d\nBut Goucher College Poll Director Mileah Kromer told the Washington Examiner that while it would be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d for any GOP candidate to beat Trump in a primary, the Mueller report findings, if significant, could change that.\nAnd Hogan would be in position to challenge Trump.\n\u201cHogan would have the advantage of having a record of political experience that is fully independent of and distinct from President Trump,\u201d Kromer said. \u201cHe could run as the un-Trump Republican \u2014 and if there's something damaging enough to shake the GOP base in the Mueller report, that might be appealing to Republican voters.\u201d",

                "html": "<p>House Democrats on Tuesday introduced legislation to require 11 states and dozens of counties with recent histories of voter discrimination to receive approval from the federal government before making any changes to their election laws.</p>\n<p>The Voting Rights Advancement Act is a move to repair the Voting Rights Act of 1965, part of which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. That decision outraged Democrats who said the court essentially gutted a key provision of the law that was meant to correct decades of discriminatory treatment of black voters.</p>\n<p>The 11 states that are expected to be affected under the new VRAA are Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. The new list is slightly shorter than the one had the bill become law last year when 13 states were predicted to be covered. The two states no longer covered under the new bill are Arizona and Arkansas.</p>\n<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., didn't outline a plan to bring the bill, co-sponsored by more than 200 House lawmakers and 46 senators, to the floor, but indicated it's a bill Democrats will move soon.</p>\n<p>&quot;We must finish the long march to progress, passing H.R. 4 to protect the ballot and advance justice for all,&quot; said Pelosi.</p>\n<p>In the 2013 case <i>Shelby vs. Holder</i>, the court said the criteria used under the VRA to determine which states or counties need to pre-clear their voting law changes with the Justice Department was out-dated, and didn't reflect the realities on the ground after nearly 50 years. The court called on Congress to update the law in a way that recognizes how some parts of the country have improved.</p>\n<p>But Democrats said that court ruling gave states more leeway to pass even more restrictive voting laws. Since 2013, 19 states have implemented restrictive voter identification laws, closed polling places, and shortened early voting periods, charged Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala. Sewell introduced the VRAA in the House, while Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., is leading the Democrats' work in the Senate, where it is likely to face steep opposition.</p>\n<p>Anticipating a struggle, Democrats in both chambers vowed to hold hearings in order to create a public record of states and localities where pre-clearance should be enforced.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is just a drumbeat. This legislation in order to become law must pass the House, the Senate, and be signed by the president,&quot; Sewell said. &quot;And currently we have an environment that's hostile to doing what we can do to make it easier for people to vote.&quot;</p>\n<p>The issue of voter fraud received national attention again in 2018 after defeated Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams accused Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp, her rival, of abusing his position as the state's elections supervisor to boost his own chances of electoral success. Kemp has defended his 55,000-vote margin of victory, denying the GOP reduced the number of polling places in some areas of the state.</p>\n<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Tuesday lambasted the bill in a Senate floor speech, referring to it as &quot;the Democrat Politician Protection Act.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Speaker Pelosi&rsquo;s massive, new federal takeover of the way states and communities run their elections &mdash; contains no effort whatsoever to crack down on ballot harvesting,&quot; McConnell said. &ldquo;This practice makes elections a kind of scavenger hunt to see which side&rsquo;s operatives can return to headquarters with the most ballots in the trunk of their car. And once those operatives take a hold of those ballots, the voters have no way to keep tabs on whether they were ever delivered.&quot;</p>\n<p>McConnell's comments reference complaints made in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District before and after the 2018 election between Republican Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready. A GOP-linked consultant, McCrae Dowless, allegedly paid people to collect absentee mail-in ballots from voters in two counties, a felony under North Carolina law to prevent tampering.</p>\n<p>The seat has remained vacant in Congress as local officials have refused to certify unofficial tallies from last November that indicated Harris won the race by about 900 votes. A new election has since been called.</p>",

This legislation in order to become law must pass the House, the Senate, and be signed by the president,\" Sewell said. \"And currently we have an environment that's hostile to doing what we can do to make it easier for people to vote.\"\nThe issue of voter fraud received national attention again in 2018 after defeated Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams accused Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp, her rival, of abusing his position as the state's elections supervisor to boost his own chances of electoral success. Kemp has defended his 55,000-vote margin of victory, denying the GOP reduced the number of polling places in some areas of the state.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Tuesday lambasted the bill in a Senate floor speech, referring to it as \"the Democrat Politician Protection Act.\"\n\"Speaker Pelosi\u2019s massive, new federal takeover of the way states and communities run their elections \u2014 contains no effort whatsoever to crack down on ballot harvesting,\" McConnell said. \u201cThis practice makes elections a kind of scavenger hunt to see which side\u2019s operatives can return to headquarters with the most ballots in the trunk of their car. And once those operatives take a hold of those ballots, the voters have no way to keep tabs on whether they were ever delivered.\"\nMcConnell's comments reference complaints made in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District before and after the 2018 election between Republican Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready. A GOP-linked consultant, McCrae Dowless, allegedly paid people to collect absentee mail-in ballots from voters in two counties, a felony under North Carolina law to prevent tampering.\nThe seat has remained vacant in Congress as local officials have refused to certify unofficial tallies from last November that indicated Harris won the race by about 900 votes. A new election has since been called.",

She is described as a white woman, about 5-foot-5 with brown hair. Jefferson County police say that Sol was last seen within county limits wearing a black T-shirt, camouflage-print pants, and black boots. Law enforcement officials confirmed that her presence in the area, given her background regarding her obsession with the Columbine shooting, was the motive behind calling the schools' lockdown.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Last night, Sol Pais traveled to Colorado and made threats in the Denver metropolitan area,&rdquo; Jefferson County sheriff&rsquo;s officials wrote on Facebook. &ldquo;She is armed and considered to be extremely dangerous.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&quot;Please call the FBI tipline at (303) 630-6227 where your call will be answered immediately if you have seen this individual or have information on her whereabouts. Please do not approach her as she is considered armed and dangerous.&quot;</p>\n<p>Mike Taplin, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, said the office is working alongside federal authorities, including the FBI, in investigating the threat. More than a dozen schools, including Columbine High School, have heightened their security and are under lockdown. Taplin, however, did not give any additional information regarding the threat.</p>\n<p>The threats come four days short of the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting, when two of the school's students, Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, killed 12 students and one teacher. The pair had also planted around the campus small homemade bombs, which did not explode. Law enforcement officials have not publicly made any connection between the threats and the anniversary of the shooting.</p>",

She is described as a white woman, about 5-foot-5 with brown hair. Jefferson County police say that Sol was last seen within county limits wearing a black T-shirt, camouflage-print pants, and black boots. Law enforcement officials confirmed that her presence in the area, given her background regarding her obsession with the Columbine shooting, was the motive behind calling the schools' lockdown.\n\u201cLast night, Sol Pais traveled to Colorado and made threats in the Denver metropolitan area,\u201d Jefferson County sheriff\u2019s officials wrote on Facebook. \u201cShe is armed and considered to be extremely dangerous.\u201d\n\"Please call the FBI tipline at (303) 630-6227 where your call will be answered immediately if you have seen this individual or have information on her whereabouts. Please do not approach her as she is considered armed and dangerous.\"\nMike Taplin, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, said the office is working alongside federal authorities, including the FBI, in investigating the threat. More than a dozen schools, including Columbine High School, have heightened their security and are under lockdown. Taplin, however, did not give any additional information regarding the threat.\nThe threats come four days short of the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting, when two of the school's students, Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, killed 12 students and one teacher. The pair had also planted around the campus small homemade bombs, which did not explode. Law enforcement officials have not publicly made any connection between the threats and the anniversary of the shooting.",

                "html": "<p>A federal judge handling a case centered around special counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s final report criticized Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday, saying he has &ldquo;created an environment&quot; fostering concerns about transparency.</p>\n<p>Judge Reggie Walton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia delivered the rebuke in federal court before ruling that the Justice Department would not be compelled to provide BuzzFeed with a version of the Mueller report by Thursday. The judge&rsquo;s words appeared to echo concerns about Barr that congressional Democrats have also expressed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Obviously there is a real concern about whether there will be transparency &hellip; I hope that the government will be as transparent as it can be,&rdquo; Walton said.</p>\n<p>&quot;The attorney general has created an environment that has caused a significant part of the American public to be concerned about whether there will be full transparency,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>BuzzFeed is seeking Mueller&rsquo;s report through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit and asked for it to be provided to them under an expedited schedule by April 18, which is this Thursday. Earlier this week, the DOJ announced it will be <a data-cms-href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-to-release-mueller-report-thursday\" data-cms-id=\"0000016a-21b9-daf4-a96e-29b972250000\" href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-to-release-mueller-report-thursday\">providing a copy of Mueller&rsquo;s highly anticipated report</a> to Congress that same day with redactions being overseen by Barr.</p>\n<p>In his opening remarks, Walton said that even though he doesn&rsquo;t know what the redacted Mueller report released by Barr will look like, &ldquo;it seems to me that it&rsquo;s premature to believe that what will be released on Thursday will be different than what would be released under FOIA.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>[ <b>Opinion:</b> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/william-barr-better-be-ready-to-explain-all-redactions-in-robert-mueller-report\">William Barr better be ready to explain all redactions in Robert Mueller report</a>]</p>\n<p>BuzzFeed filed its Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in early April, asking the court for injunctive relief to compel the Justice Department to provide a copy of the Mueller report to them. Walton denied a similar request earlier this month that was brought by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, but the research center had also sought a whole host of other nonpublic documents related to the special counsel investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election as well. BuzzFeed had hoped it might receive a more favorable ruling because its request was much narrower than the information sought by the research center. That didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>\n<p>DOJ&rsquo;s attorney argued to Walton that &ldquo;an injunction is an extraordinary act with a high burden&rdquo; and said that &ldquo;this is particularly true when trying to order the Justice Department to do something.&rdquo; In prior court filings, DOJ argued BuzzFeed &ldquo;cannot establish irreparable harm,&quot; specifically citing the fact that Barr sought to release the Mueller report in mid-April and said he would &ldquo;color code&rdquo; the report with &ldquo;explanatory notes describing the basis for each redaction.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Matthew Topic, the attorney for both BuzzFeed and its journalist Jason Leopold, said, &ldquo;We intend to challenge the redactions&rdquo; and argued that &ldquo;the longer we wait to get the FOIA response, the longer it takes for us to move this case forward.&rdquo; In a recent court filing, BuzzFeed said, &ldquo;It is likely, given the categories of information the Attorney General has already determined will be redacted, that we are at the first step of what could be a lengthy legal process to decide whether those redactions are legally permissible under FOIA.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Given the number of public pronouncements made by government officials such as President Trump and others, Topic said there was an incredible public interest in knowing what the full Mueller report contains. Countering the idea that further delay wouldn&rsquo;t cause any harm, Topic argued, &ldquo;The irreparable harm would be being forced to wait.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Walton disagreed, saying BuzzFeed &ldquo;cannot be harmed irreparably by waiting a little longer. &hellip; I don&rsquo;t doubt there&rsquo;s some harm, but it&rsquo;s not irreparable.&rdquo; He denied BuzzFeed&rsquo;s motion for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>After ruling that he would not order DOJ to provide a copy of the Mueller report to BuzzFeed by Thursday, Walton set another hearing for May 2. He also said the Electronic Privacy Information Center would have another hearing that day too and suggested he might combine the relevant parts of the two cases.</p>\n<p>Walton said he wanted DOJ to be prepared on May 2 to share whether the redacted report released Thursday is the same as what would have been released via the Freedom of Information Act, but DOJ&rsquo;s attorney could not say whether they would know by that time.</p>\n<p><a data-cms-href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-attorney-general-william-barrs-letter-on-mueller-final-report\" data-cms-id=\"00000169-b140-d337-af6f-bb7611f10000\" href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-attorney-general-william-barrs-letter-on-mueller-final-report\">Barr provided a four-page summary of Mueller's report</a> last month, which said Mueller did not establish the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 presidential campaign. The summary also said Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed justice during the investigation but said Mueller also did not exonerate the president. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded Trump had not committed obstruction.</p>\n<p>Barr later identified four categories of information that will not be made public, including material related to grand jury proceedings which by law cannot be made public, information deemed by the intelligence community to compromise sensitive sources and methods, details that could affect other ongoing investigations &mdash; including those referred by the special counsel&rsquo;s office to other offices &mdash; and material that would &ldquo;unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Walton said that &quot;because Mueller conducted much of his investigation in front of a grand jury,&quot; he wouldn't be surprised to see that information redacted.</p>\n<p>The BuzzFeed case is likely just the beginning of a multi-front battle for the full Mueller report. In addition to Freedom of Information Act litigation from the Electronic Privacy Information Center and BuzzFeed working its way through the courts, Democrats in Congress have made it quite clear that they intend on using their powers to subpoena the full report as well as to bring in witnesses, including Barr and possibly Mueller.</p>",

                "text": "A federal judge handling a case centered around special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s final report criticized Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday, saying he has \u201ccreated an environment\" fostering concerns about transparency.\nJudge Reggie Walton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia delivered the rebuke in federal court before ruling that the Justice Department would not be compelled to provide BuzzFeed with a version of the Mueller report by Thursday. The judge\u2019s words appeared to echo concerns about Barr that congressional Democrats have also expressed.\n\u201cObviously there is a real concern about whether there will be transparency \u2026 I hope that the government will be as transparent as it can be,\u201d Walton said.\n\"The attorney general has created an environment that has caused a significant part of the American public to be concerned about whether there will be full transparency,\" he said.\nBuzzFeed is seeking Mueller\u2019s report through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit and asked for it to be provided to them under an expedited schedule by April 18, which is this Thursday. Earlier this week, the DOJ announced it will be providing a copy of Mueller\u2019s highly anticipated report to Congress that same day with redactions being overseen by Barr.\nIn his opening remarks, Walton said that even though he doesn\u2019t know what the redacted Mueller report released by Barr will look like, \u201cit seems to me that it\u2019s premature to believe that what will be released on Thursday will be different than what would be released under FOIA.\u201d\n[ Opinion: William Barr better be ready to explain all redactions in Robert Mueller report]\nBuzzFeed filed its Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in early April, asking the court for injunctive relief to compel the Justice Department to provide a copy of the Mueller report to them. Walton denied a similar request earlier this month that was brought by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, but the research center had also sought a whole host of other nonpublic documents related to the special counsel investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election as well. BuzzFeed had hoped it might receive a more favorable ruling because its request was much narrower than the information sought by the research center. That didn\u2019t happen.\nDOJ\u2019s attorney argued to Walton that \u201can injunction is an extraordinary act with a high burden\u201d and said that \u201cthis is particularly true when trying to order the Justice Department to do something.\u201d In prior court filings, DOJ argued BuzzFeed \u201ccannot establish irreparable harm,\" specifically citing the fact that Barr sought to release the Mueller report in mid-April and said he would \u201ccolor code\u201d the report with \u201cexplanatory notes describing the basis for each redaction.\u201d\nMatthew Topic, the attorney for both BuzzFeed and its journalist Jason Leopold, said, \u201cWe intend to challenge the redactions\u201d and argued that \u201cthe longer we wait to get the FOIA response, the longer it takes for us to move this case forward.\u201d In a recent court filing, BuzzFeed said, \u201cIt is likely, given the categories of information the Attorney General has already determined will be redacted, that we are at the first step of what could be a lengthy legal process to decide whether those redactions are legally permissible under FOIA.\u201d\nGiven the number of public pronouncements made by government officials such as President Trump and others, Topic said there was an incredible public interest in knowing what the full Mueller report contains. Countering the idea that further delay wouldn\u2019t cause any harm, Topic argued, \u201cThe irreparable harm would be being forced to wait.\u201d\nWalton disagreed, saying BuzzFeed \u201ccannot be harmed irreparably by waiting a little longer. \u2026 I don\u2019t doubt there\u2019s some harm, but it\u2019s not irreparable.\u201d He denied BuzzFeed\u2019s motion for injunctive relief.\nAfter ruling that he would not order DOJ to provide a copy of the Mueller report to BuzzFeed by Thursday, Walton set another hearing for May 2. He also said the Electronic Privacy Information Center would have another hearing that day too and suggested he might combine the relevant parts of the two cases.\nWalton said he wanted DOJ to be prepared on May 2 to share whether the redacted report released Thursday is the same as what would have been released via the Freedom of Information Act, but DOJ\u2019s attorney could not say whether they would know by that time.\nBarr provided a four-page summary of Mueller's report last month, which said Mueller did not establish the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 presidential campaign. The summary also said Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed justice during the investigation but said Mueller also did not exonerate the president. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded Trump had not committed obstruction.\nBarr later identified four categories of information that will not be made public, including material related to grand jury proceedings which by law cannot be made public, information deemed by the intelligence community to compromise sensitive sources and methods, details that could affect other ongoing investigations \u2014 including those referred by the special counsel\u2019s office to other offices \u2014 and material that would \u201cunduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.\u201d\nWalton said that \"because Mueller conducted much of his investigation in front of a grand jury,\" he wouldn't be surprised to see that information redacted.\nThe BuzzFeed case is likely just the beginning of a multi-front battle for the full Mueller report. In addition to Freedom of Information Act litigation from the Electronic Privacy Information Center and BuzzFeed working its way through the courts, Democrats in Congress have made it quite clear that they intend on using their powers to subpoena the full report as well as to bring in witnesses, including Barr and possibly Mueller.",

By contrast, a mere 28% of respondents said they do not believe it, while nearly 35% said they do not know or have any opinion about the subject.\nDuring testimony before a Senate panel last week, Barr said it was his obligation to ensure the government did not abuse its surveillance powers.\n\"I think spying did occur. But the question is whether it was predicated \u2014 adequately predicated,\" Barr testified. \"I'm not suggesting it wasn't adequately predicated, but I need to explore that. I think it's my obligation. Congress is usually very concerned about intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies staying in their proper lane.\"\nBarr has set up a team to investigate whether politically motivated surveillance on the Trump campaign took place.\nThe survey also stratifies respondents by political party, with 57% of Republicans saying they agree with Barr and only 24% of Democrats saying the same.\nA redacted version of the full, roughly 400-page Mueller report is due out Thursday. The redactions will cover details on grand jury material, foreign intelligence that could compromise sources and methods, and derogatory information about people who were not charged.\nThe survey polled 1998 registered voters nationwide from April 12-14. The interviews were conducted online. The data has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.",

Tens of thousands have died in the conflict between the coalition forces, led by Saudi Arabia, and the Houthi rebel forces, backed by Iran.</p>\n<p>The bipartisan legislation sought to pull back U.S. support for the coalition through the War Powers Act, a little-used law that allows Congress to pull troops out of a foreign conflict that has not been authorized by the legislature with a declaration of war.</p>\n<p>Trump's response argued there are no U.S. forces in the country.</p>\n<p>&quot;There are no United States military personnel in Yemen commanding, participating in, or accompanying military forces of the Saudi\u2011led coalition against the Houthis in hostilities in or affecting Yemen,&quot; his message states. &quot;Since 2015, the United States has provided limited support to member countries of the Saudi-led coalition, including intelligence sharing, logistics support, and, until recently, in-flight refueling of non-United States aircraft.&quot;</p>\n<p>The bill passed the Senate in March, 54-46, and the House of Representatives in April, 247-175. Neither tally would be enough to overturn the veto, which would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers.</p>\n<p>The veto is the second of his tenure.

Tens of thousands have died in the conflict between the coalition forces, led by Saudi Arabia, and the Houthi rebel forces, backed by Iran.\nThe bipartisan legislation sought to pull back U.S. support for the coalition through the War Powers Act, a little-used law that allows Congress to pull troops out of a foreign conflict that has not been authorized by the legislature with a declaration of war.\nTrump's response argued there are no U.S. forces in the country.\n\"There are no United States military personnel in Yemen commanding, participating in, or accompanying military forces of the Saudi\u2011led coalition against the Houthis in hostilities in or affecting Yemen,\" his message states. \"Since 2015, the United States has provided limited support to member countries of the Saudi-led coalition, including intelligence sharing, logistics support, and, until recently, in-flight refueling of non-United States aircraft.\"\nThe bill passed the Senate in March, 54-46, and the House of Representatives in April, 247-175. Neither tally would be enough to overturn the veto, which would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers.\nThe veto is the second of his tenure. Trump vetoed in March legislation that would have ended the national emergency he declared at the southern border.\n[Related: Republicans beat back House attempt to override Trump's border wall veto]",

Cory Booker in an office stairwell during the time he was living in a halfway house in Newark, New Jersey, according to a new book.</p>\n<p>The content of their talks was not relayed in <i>Kushner, Inc.</i>, released Tuesday by author Vicky Ward, though the conversations followed the billionaire&rsquo;s years-long financial backing for Booker, at the time a local politician.</p>\n<p>The link between Booker and the felonious father of President Trump&rsquo;s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner is likely to receive attention due to <a data-cms-href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/cory-booker-jumps-into-2020-race\" data-cms-id=\"00000168-a8f8-df7b-afec-acf86b0a0000\" href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/cory-booker-jumps-into-2020-race\">Booker&rsquo;s bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination</a>.</p>\n<p>Ward did not report whether the stairwell conversations occurred before or after Booker&rsquo;s election as mayor of Newark, and a spokeswoman for Booker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Kushner entered a Newark halfway house after he was released in April 2006 from federal prison, where he had served 14 months after pleading guilty to tax fraud, making illegal campaign contributions, and witness tampering as part of a scandal involving paying a woman to seduce his brother-in-law before providing a tape to his sister.</p>\n<p>Booker was elected mayor of Newark in May 2006, shortly after Kushner&rsquo;s release from prison.</p>\n<p>The elder Kushner had supported Booker&rsquo;s unsuccessful 2002 candidacy for mayor, reportedly steering $50,000 to his bid. His opponent, four-term mayor Sharpe James, claimed Booker was &ldquo;collaborating with Jews to take over Newark.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ward writes that the link continued in 2006, despite Kushner&rsquo;s conviction.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;According to a source, during his stay [in Newark], Charlie was permitted to work from a nearby office, where Cory Booker, who became Newark mayor around that time and is now a U.S. senator, would meet with him on the stairway,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>\n<p>Kushner had been deeply linked to Democratic state politics, closely backing former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey. The family has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/chris-christie-jared-kushner-carried-out-a-political-hit-job-against-me\">long-standing animosity</a> toward former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, for his role in prosecuting Kushner&rsquo;s crimes.</p>\n<p>Though they had a close relationship in the past, Kushner and Booker reportedly had a fissure after Booker, then a senator, supported former President Barack Obama&rsquo;s Iran nuclear deal, which faced a Senate vote in 2015.</p>\n<p>Ward writes that Kushner, &ldquo;in front of people on a job site&rdquo; had &ldquo;shouted at Booker on the phone, saying he had &lsquo;betrayed&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>",

Cory Booker in an office stairwell during the time he was living in a halfway house in Newark, New Jersey, according to a new book.\nThe content of their talks was not relayed in Kushner, Inc., released Tuesday by author Vicky Ward, though the conversations followed the billionaire\u2019s years-long financial backing for Booker, at the time a local politician.\nThe link between Booker and the felonious father of President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner is likely to receive attention due to Booker\u2019s bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\nWard did not report whether the stairwell conversations occurred before or after Booker\u2019s election as mayor of Newark, and a spokeswoman for Booker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nKushner entered a Newark halfway house after he was released in April 2006 from federal prison, where he had served 14 months after pleading guilty to tax fraud, making illegal campaign contributions, and witness tampering as part of a scandal involving paying a woman to seduce his brother-in-law before providing a tape to his sister.\nBooker was elected mayor of Newark in May 2006, shortly after Kushner\u2019s release from prison.\nThe elder Kushner had supported Booker\u2019s unsuccessful 2002 candidacy for mayor, reportedly steering $50,000 to his bid. His opponent, four-term mayor Sharpe James, claimed Booker was \u201ccollaborating with Jews to take over Newark.\u201d\nWard writes that the link continued in 2006, despite Kushner\u2019s conviction.\n\u201cAccording to a source, during his stay [in Newark], Charlie was permitted to work from a nearby office, where Cory Booker, who became Newark mayor around that time and is now a U.S. senator, would meet with him on the stairway,\u201d she wrote.\nKushner had been deeply linked to Democratic state politics, closely backing former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey. The family has long-standing animosity toward former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, for his role in prosecuting Kushner\u2019s crimes.\nThough they had a close relationship in the past, Kushner and Booker reportedly had a fissure after Booker, then a senator, supported former President Barack Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal, which faced a Senate vote in 2015.\nWard writes that Kushner, \u201cin front of people on a job site\u201d had \u201cshouted at Booker on the phone, saying he had \u2018betrayed\u2019 him.\u201d",

                "html": "<p><b>IRVINE, Calif.&mdash; </b>When Saga Zhou first moved to the United States from China in 2009, she steered clear of politics. The Communist Party rules supreme in China, so most Chinese immigrants bring a built-in aversion to political involvement.</p>\n<p>But Zhou&rsquo;s interest in politics was piqued as she began to see the American Left embracing policies that reminded her of those she&rsquo;d fled in China.</p>\n<p>One such policy was the Left&rsquo;s support for late-term abortion. When she lived in China, Zhou, like many young Chinese, didn&rsquo;t consider abortion to be a big deal. But her view changed after moving to America, getting married, and bearing two children.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;After I became a mother, my understanding about life fundamentally changed,&rdquo; she told me when we met at a Panera Bread in Irvine. &ldquo;Now I am totally a mother.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Zhou said her heart broke upon learning about a Virginia bill to loosen restrictions on late-term abortions. Appearing on a radio show as the bill was being debated, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam pledged to sign the legislation, even suggesting it would sanction infanticide.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, when I saw the news, I cannot even open [the article],&rdquo; Zhou said through tears. &ldquo;It was really hard. I just felt something really strong into my chest. And then I said, &lsquo;Let me adopt him, don&rsquo;t kill him.'&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The proposed law hit especially close to home for Zhou, whose mother became pregnant with her just as China&rsquo;s government began implementing its brutal one-child policy.</p>\n<p>The policy prohibited most couples from having more than one child. Women who became pregnant with a second child were often forced to undergo sterilization; sometimes their babies were killed in the womb. Though she was her mother&rsquo;s second child, Zhou escaped death because the one-child policy had not yet been implemented in her city.</p>\n<figure data-align=\"center\"> <img alt=\"Zhou.jpg\" data-image-size=\"fixed\" src=\"https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cdd6b24/2147483647/strip/true/crop/960x720+0+0/resize/960x720!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fd1%2F40%2Ff64775ab4e049b44a9fa7e5a5487%2Fzhou.jpg\"></img>  </figure>\n<p>&ldquo;Somebody has to understand the roots, where these policies come from,&rdquo; Zhou said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so pissed. Damn socialism. Why are you chasing me?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As Democrats embrace policies such as so-called &quot;Medicare for all,&quot; &ldquo;free&rdquo; college, 70 percent tax rates, the &quot;Green New Deal,&quot; and late-term abortion, Republicans see an opportunity to frame the 2020 election as a referendum on socialism.</p>\n<p>President Trump now includes a riff on the &ldquo;dangers of socialism&rdquo; in most of his speeches, including in last month&rsquo;s State of the Union. &ldquo;Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country,&rdquo; he told Congress and the nation.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.congressionalleadershipfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-We-Win-The-House-Back-3.5.19.pdf\"><u>internal memo</u></a> from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, discusses its plan to win the suburbs and retake the House of Representatives by framing the 2020 election as a choice between socialism and economic opportunity.</p>\n<p>The Republican Party&rsquo;s anti-communism has long attracted many Cubans, Vietnamese, Eastern Europeans, and other immigrants who fled communist countries during the Cold War.</p>\n<p>Chinese immigrants have historically been an afterthought. But their numbers are rising. There are more than 3 million Chinese immigrants living in America today, up from fewer than half a million in 1980.</p>\n<p>As their numbers grow, Chinese-Americans are becoming more active in politics. In 2014, a group of Chinese-Americans in Orange County, Calif., formed The Orange Club, a political action committee whose original purpose was to defeat Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 5, which sought to overturn a 1996 initiative that ended affirmative action in state university admissions. The club argued that SCA-5 would unfairly hurt their high-achieving children&rsquo;s chances of getting into California&rsquo;s top state-run universities.</p>\n<p>SCA-5 ultimately failed, due in part to strong opposition from Asian-American groups including The Orange Club, which remains active in local public policy debates and endorses candidates for office.</p>\n<p>Zhou joined TOC last year and ever since has been attending meetings, signing online petitions, and protesting at public events&ndash;all things she couldn&rsquo;t have imagined doing in China.</p>\n<p>When I first met Zhou in February, she was volunteering at a phone bank for Don Wagner, the mayor of Irvine who was running in a special election for Orange County supervisor. On March 13, the morning after Wagner won the race, the Orange County Register&rsquo;s front-page story included a photo of Wagner standing in front of several jubilant supporters, including Zhou.</p>\n<p>In 2008 and 2012, many Chinese-American voters cast their presidential ballots for Barack Obama, believing Obama&rsquo;s Democratic Party was more hospitable to immigrants. &ldquo;On the first day when we land here, the media and Left reinforce the concept that minorities and immigrants are supposed to vote for Democrats and not supposed to be aligning with conservatives,&rdquo; said George Li, a Chinese immigrant I met at a Starbucks in Irvine.</p>\n<p>But many Chinese-Americans are repelled by the Democrats&rsquo; more recent embrace of policies they consider socialist. Socialism &ldquo;is a great, great concern to [Chinese-Americans], which is why I&rsquo;m really motivated to stop that,&rdquo; Li said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our duty.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As a college student in China in the late 1980&rsquo;s, Li was active in China&rsquo;s democracy movement and knew some of the students involved in the Tiananmen Square protests.</p>\n<p>Not long after, Li moved to the U.S., earning a master&rsquo;s degree in computer information systems and starting a family. Li has become active in local politics through The Orange Club, which he led last year.</p>\n<p>Li believes the Republican Party is a natural fit for Chinese-Americans.</p>\n<p>Traditional Chinese culture is conservative, he said, emphasizing hard work, independence, education, and family values.</p>\n<p>He finds the Left&rsquo;s obsession with political correctness maddening because it intimidates people into silence. &ldquo;This intimidation is so bad for freedom of speech,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A lot of things I see in this country are very similar to what I saw in the Cultural Revolution era in China,&rdquo; He calls political correctness a &ldquo;form of cultural Marxism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Benjamin Yu, also of Irvine, saw the Democratic Party moving toward socialism long before some of its members began embracing the term.</p>\n<p>Yu immigrated to the U.S. with his mother in the late 1990s. In the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, Yu, then a U.S. Green Card holder, felt a &ldquo;surge of patriotism,&rdquo; prompting him to join the Army.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When something happens so close to you, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are an American by legal status,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You get a sense that that&rsquo;s your country. You feel part of the community.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure data-align=\"center\"> <img alt=\"Yu.jpg\" data-image-size=\"fixed\" src=\"https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de7fb3d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/960x720+0+0/resize/960x720!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F9c%2F6c%2F02355fad49f996ac771f39e3376f%2Fyu.jpg\"></img>  </figure>\n<p>Yu saw a nascent socialism developing under President Barack Obama, whom he voted for twice before turning to Trump in 2016. He believes more and more Chinese are voting Republican, though he thinks many are reluctant to say so for fear of being ostracized.</p>\n<p>Zhou, Li, and Yu believe Republicans can win over Chinese-American voters by emphasizing the Democrats&rsquo; embrace of socialism, and the GOP&rsquo;s staunch opposition to it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I just want America to be America,&rdquo; Li said, &ldquo;not another Soviet Union, Cuba, or China.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><i>Daniel Allott (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielallott\">@DanielAllott</a>) is a contributor to the Washington Examiner's Beltway Confidential blog.

                "text": "IRVINE, Calif.\u2014 When Saga Zhou first moved to the United States from China in 2009, she steered clear of politics. The Communist Party rules supreme in China, so most Chinese immigrants bring a built-in aversion to political involvement.\nBut Zhou\u2019s interest in politics was piqued as she began to see the American Left embracing policies that reminded her of those she\u2019d fled in China.\nOne such policy was the Left\u2019s support for late-term abortion. When she lived in China, Zhou, like many young Chinese, didn\u2019t consider abortion to be a big deal. But her view changed after moving to America, getting married, and bearing two children.\n\u201cAfter I became a mother, my understanding about life fundamentally changed,\u201d she told me when we met at a Panera Bread in Irvine. \u201cNow I am totally a mother.\u201d\nZhou said her heart broke upon learning about a Virginia bill to loosen restrictions on late-term abortions. Appearing on a radio show as the bill was being debated, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam pledged to sign the legislation, even suggesting it would sanction infanticide.\n\u201cOh, when I saw the news, I cannot even open [the article],\u201d Zhou said through tears. \u201cIt was really hard. I just felt something really strong into my chest. And then I said, \u2018Let me adopt him, don\u2019t kill him.'\u201d\nThe proposed law hit especially close to home for Zhou, whose mother became pregnant with her just as China\u2019s government began implementing its brutal one-child policy.\nThe policy prohibited most couples from having more than one child. Women who became pregnant with a second child were often forced to undergo sterilization; sometimes their babies were killed in the womb. Though she was her mother\u2019s second child, Zhou escaped death because the one-child policy had not yet been implemented in her city.\n\u201cSomebody has to understand the roots, where these policies come from,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so pissed. Damn socialism. Why are you chasing me?\u201d\nAs Democrats embrace policies such as so-called \"Medicare for all,\" \u201cfree\u201d college, 70 percent tax rates, the \"Green New Deal,\" and late-term abortion, Republicans see an opportunity to frame the 2020 election as a referendum on socialism.\nPresident Trump now includes a riff on the \u201cdangers of socialism\u201d in most of his speeches, including in last month\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cTonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country,\u201d he told Congress and the nation.\nAn internal memo from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, discusses its plan to win the suburbs and retake the House of Representatives by framing the 2020 election as a choice between socialism and economic opportunity.\nThe Republican Party\u2019s anti-communism has long attracted many Cubans, Vietnamese, Eastern Europeans, and other immigrants who fled communist countries during the Cold War.\nChinese immigrants have historically been an afterthought. But their numbers are rising. There are more than 3 million Chinese immigrants living in America today, up from fewer than half a million in 1980.\nAs their numbers grow, Chinese-Americans are becoming more active in politics. In 2014, a group of Chinese-Americans in Orange County, Calif., formed The Orange Club, a political action committee whose original purpose was to defeat Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 5, which sought to overturn a 1996 initiative that ended affirmative action in state university admissions. The club argued that SCA-5 would unfairly hurt their high-achieving children\u2019s chances of getting into California\u2019s top state-run universities.\nSCA-5 ultimately failed, due in part to strong opposition from Asian-American groups including The Orange Club, which remains active in local public policy debates and endorses candidates for office.\nZhou joined TOC last year and ever since has been attending meetings, signing online petitions, and protesting at public events\u2013all things she couldn\u2019t have imagined doing in China.\nWhen I first met Zhou in February, she was volunteering at a phone bank for Don Wagner, the mayor of Irvine who was running in a special election for Orange County supervisor. On March 13, the morning after Wagner won the race, the Orange County Register\u2019s front-page story included a photo of Wagner standing in front of several jubilant supporters, including Zhou.\nIn 2008 and 2012, many Chinese-American voters cast their presidential ballots for Barack Obama, believing Obama\u2019s Democratic Party was more hospitable to immigrants. \u201cOn the first day when we land here, the media and Left reinforce the concept that minorities and immigrants are supposed to vote for Democrats and not supposed to be aligning with conservatives,\u201d said George Li, a Chinese immigrant I met at a Starbucks in Irvine.\nBut many Chinese-Americans are repelled by the Democrats\u2019 more recent embrace of policies they consider socialist. Socialism \u201cis a great, great concern to [Chinese-Americans], which is why I\u2019m really motivated to stop that,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty.\u201d\nAs a college student in China in the late 1980\u2019s, Li was active in China\u2019s democracy movement and knew some of the students involved in the Tiananmen Square protests.\nNot long after, Li moved to the U.S., earning a master\u2019s degree in computer information systems and starting a family. Li has become active in local politics through The Orange Club, which he led last year.\nLi believes the Republican Party is a natural fit for Chinese-Americans.\nTraditional Chinese culture is conservative, he said, emphasizing hard work, independence, education, and family values.\nHe finds the Left\u2019s obsession with political correctness maddening because it intimidates people into silence. \u201cThis intimidation is so bad for freedom of speech,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of things I see in this country are very similar to what I saw in the Cultural Revolution era in China,\u201d He calls political correctness a \u201cform of cultural Marxism.\u201d\nBenjamin Yu, also of Irvine, saw the Democratic Party moving toward socialism long before some of its members began embracing the term.\nYu immigrated to the U.S. with his mother in the late 1990s. In the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, Yu, then a U.S. Green Card holder, felt a \u201csurge of patriotism,\u201d prompting him to join the Army.\n\u201cWhen something happens so close to you, it doesn\u2019t matter if you are an American by legal status,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a sense that that\u2019s your country. You feel part of the community.\u201d\nYu saw a nascent socialism developing under President Barack Obama, whom he voted for twice before turning to Trump in 2016. He believes more and more Chinese are voting Republican, though he thinks many are reluctant to say so for fear of being ostracized.\nZhou, Li, and Yu believe Republicans can win over Chinese-American voters by emphasizing the Democrats\u2019 embrace of socialism, and the GOP\u2019s staunch opposition to it.\n\u201cI just want America to be America,\u201d Li said, \u201cnot another Soviet Union, Cuba, or China.\u201d\nDaniel Allott (@DanielAllott) is a contributor to the Washington Examiner's Beltway Confidential blog.

But regulatory policies in the District, Georgia, New York, New Jersey, and other states won&rsquo;t make it easy.</p>\n<p>First, the good news. The Trump administration is moving this month to make providers disclose their prices, including the prices they charge insurers.</p>\n<p>The new initiative complements several related steps the administration has taken. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for example, recently launched a <a href=\"https://www.medicare.gov/procedure-price-lookup/cost/45385\">website</a>, &ldquo;Procedure Price Lookup,&rdquo; enabling Medicare patients to compare total and out of pocket costs for procedures commonly performed at hospital outpatient facilities and ambulatory surgical centers.</p>\n<p>The agency&rsquo;s hope is that by providing information about the costs of various medical procedures, patients will be empowered to shop more prudently, discouraging some facilities from overcharging.</p>\n<p>The White House also is hoping to use price transparency to reduce medical costs in other areas. The administration&rsquo;s American Patients First <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/president-trump-wants-to-include-prices-in-drug-ads-pharma-not-so-much-2018-10-16\">proposal</a> would require drug providers selling products that cost patients more than $35 a month to reveal their prices in television advertisements. If it survives a possible challenge on First Amendment grounds, prohibiting forced speech, the rule is likely to be adopted, and many pharmaceutical companies already are <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/some-drug-companies-will-mention-prices-their-tv-ads-n920296\">preparing for this</a>. Another pending rule calls for hospitals to display <a href=\"http://www.kgoradio.com/2018/12/28/new-law-requires-hospitals-to-display-prices-online-effective-1-1-19/\">their prices online</a>.</p>\n<p>These efforts are well-intentioned and address a critically important issue. Healthcare costs account for nearly of 18 percent of U.S. Gross Domestic Product, or <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/causes-of-rising-healthcare-costs-4064878\">about $10,000 per person</a> annually. Something needs to change. But mere transparency in pricing will probably not be enough.</p>\n<p>Patients are already aware that healthcare is expensive. A <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/media-room/press-releases/2017/05/consumer_reports_survey_one_in_four_people_who_regularly_take_meds_hit_with_sticker_shock_at_the_pharmacy/\"><i>Consumer Reports</i> survey</a> found that one out of seven prescriptions goes unfilled because patients can&rsquo;t afford the cost. A <a href=\"https://www.westhealth.org/press-release/survey2018/\">similar survey</a> found nearly 44 percent of respondents avoid medical attention when sick or injured, fearing high medical bills. Policies demanding or mandating transparency are preaching to a rapidly growing and frustrated choir.</p>\n<p>What the U.S. healthcare system needs more than mere transparency is increased competition. Unfortunately, the healthcare sector&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/publication/mclaughlin-sherouse-list-10-most-regulated-industries-2014\">overly burdensome regulatory system</a> often limits competition through &ldquo;Certificate of Need&rdquo; laws and other restrictions on innovation and patient choice.</p>\n<p>These curbs are not universal; alternatives exist.</p>\n<p>Consider GenScripts Pharmacy in Oklahoma. It does not accept health insurance when filling prescriptions, to avoid the complications, overhead, and financial disincentives of the third-party reimbursement system. As a result, the company can offer hundreds of drugs, often at lower prices than the out of pocket costs patients pay through their insurance.</p>\n<p>Surgical procedures offered outside the highly regulated and bureaucratic third-party reimbursement system have shown similar results.</p>\n<p>Nearly 18 years ago, physicians Keith Smith and Steven Lantier opened the Oklahoma Surgical Center. The center competes with other surgical facilities by displaying, and guaranteeing, the prices of available procedures and bypassing insurance companies. This practice triggered a <a href=\"https://kfor.com/2013/07/08/okc-hospital-posting-surgery-prices-online/\">price war that was good for consumers</a>. Today, the Oklahoma Surgical Center offers numerous procedures, from a C-section to a rotator cuff repair, for a fraction of what the same procedure might cost elsewhere.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s no coincidence both GenScripts and the surgical center are in Oklahoma. According to the <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/hoap_1.2_state_pdf_-_oklahoma.pdf\">Healthcare Openness and Access Database</a> compiled by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, Oklahoma allows physicians greater freedom to practice medicine and consumers more access to pharmaceuticals than many other states.</p>\n<p>The District of Columbia, on the other hand, is among the worst in this regard.</p>\n<p>The result of Oklahoma&rsquo;s less restrictive regulatory climate is lower prices and more options for quality care, exactly what consumers should expect, although rarely receive, from a functioning healthcare system.</p>\n<p>Efforts to make healthcare costs more transparent are a good start. But transparency is no substitute for competition. Both are needed.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/fb/7a/ede05107427bb54bdcf2536c6b51/loading.gif\"></img></figure>\n<p><i>Raymond March, Ph.D., is a Research Fellow at the Independent Institute, Oakland, Calif., and Assistant Professor of Economics at North Dakota State University.</i></p>",

                "text": "Is Washington finally about to remedy one of the key maladies plaguing American healthcare? Perhaps. But regulatory policies in the District, Georgia, New York, New Jersey, and other states won\u2019t make it easy.\nFirst, the good news. The Trump administration is moving this month to make providers disclose their prices, including the prices they charge insurers.\nThe new initiative complements several related steps the administration has taken. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for example, recently launched a website, \u201cProcedure Price Lookup,\u201d enabling Medicare patients to compare total and out of pocket costs for procedures commonly performed at hospital outpatient facilities and ambulatory surgical centers.\nThe agency\u2019s hope is that by providing information about the costs of various medical procedures, patients will be empowered to shop more prudently, discouraging some facilities from overcharging.\nThe White House also is hoping to use price transparency to reduce medical costs in other areas. The administration\u2019s American Patients First proposal would require drug providers selling products that cost patients more than $35 a month to reveal their prices in television advertisements. If it survives a possible challenge on First Amendment grounds, prohibiting forced speech, the rule is likely to be adopted, and many pharmaceutical companies already are preparing for this. Another pending rule calls for hospitals to display their prices online.\nThese efforts are well-intentioned and address a critically important issue. Healthcare costs account for nearly of 18 percent of U.S. Gross Domestic Product, or about $10,000 per person annually. Something needs to change. But mere transparency in pricing will probably not be enough.\nPatients are already aware that healthcare is expensive. A Consumer Reports survey found that one out of seven prescriptions goes unfilled because patients can\u2019t afford the cost. A similar survey found nearly 44 percent of respondents avoid medical attention when sick or injured, fearing high medical bills. Policies demanding or mandating transparency are preaching to a rapidly growing and frustrated choir.\nWhat the U.S. healthcare system needs more than mere transparency is increased competition. Unfortunately, the healthcare sector\u2019s overly burdensome regulatory system often limits competition through \u201cCertificate of Need\u201d laws and other restrictions on innovation and patient choice.\nThese curbs are not universal; alternatives exist.\nConsider GenScripts Pharmacy in Oklahoma. It does not accept health insurance when filling prescriptions, to avoid the complications, overhead, and financial disincentives of the third-party reimbursement system. As a result, the company can offer hundreds of drugs, often at lower prices than the out of pocket costs patients pay through their insurance.\nSurgical procedures offered outside the highly regulated and bureaucratic third-party reimbursement system have shown similar results.\nNearly 18 years ago, physicians Keith Smith and Steven Lantier opened the Oklahoma Surgical Center. The center competes with other surgical facilities by displaying, and guaranteeing, the prices of available procedures and bypassing insurance companies. This practice triggered a price war that was good for consumers. Today, the Oklahoma Surgical Center offers numerous procedures, from a C-section to a rotator cuff repair, for a fraction of what the same procedure might cost elsewhere.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence both GenScripts and the surgical center are in Oklahoma. According to the Healthcare Openness and Access Database compiled by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, Oklahoma allows physicians greater freedom to practice medicine and consumers more access to pharmaceuticals than many other states.\nThe District of Columbia, on the other hand, is among the worst in this regard.\nThe result of Oklahoma\u2019s less restrictive regulatory climate is lower prices and more options for quality care, exactly what consumers should expect, although rarely receive, from a functioning healthcare system.\nEfforts to make healthcare costs more transparent are a good start. But transparency is no substitute for competition. Both are needed.\nRaymond March, Ph.D., is a Research Fellow at the Independent Institute, Oakland, Calif., and Assistant Professor of Economics at North Dakota State University.",

Trump&rsquo;s official declaration only means he&rsquo;s using his last option to address the issue.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t an choice between fidelity to the Constitution or blind loyalty to a president; though I&rsquo;ll note the executive branch is part of that newly appreciated document, and Congress has already given the president the authority to do exactly what Trump is pursuing. This is a choice about relinquishing authority to Democrats to set immigration policy even while a Republican president is in office.</p>\n<p>Obama made up his own law in 2012 that said nearly 1 million eligible illegal immigrants in the U.S. would not only be overlooked by law enforcement but could come out, declare themselves to the public, and receive indefinite legal protection.</p>\n<p>Take for granted that the program was created out of compassion &mdash; plus Obama&rsquo;s upcoming re-election &mdash; for young immigrants who may only know the U.S. as their home, but it should then also be taken for granted that if one president can dictate immigration policy within the authority Congress has given them, the same right belongs to every other president. Or, at the very least, every other president should be able to exercise power in moving to limit the influx of foreigners by erecting limited structures on the border.</p>\n<p>Not so fast, says the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit!</p>\n<p>The federal court ruled in November that the Trump administration could not end the Obama-era program with the argument that it was never legal to set it up in the first place. And yet, in the court&rsquo;s unanimous opinion, it repeatedly acknowledged that the executive branch has the right to determine enforcement of immigration law by way of <a href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2018/11/08/18-15068%20Opinion.pdf \">&ldquo;executive discretion.&rdquo;</a></p>\n<p>Page 10: Obama&rsquo;s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals &ldquo;was a permissible exercise of executive discretion.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Page 27: The Reagan administration &ldquo;exercised executive discretion to defer the deportation of the minor children of non-citizens&rdquo; and &ldquo;extended voluntary departure, the mechanism through which these individuals were allowed to remain in the United States is, like deferred action, a creature of executive discretion.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Page 69: &ldquo;We therefore conclude that DACA was a permissible exercise of executive discretion.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Who with a straight face could argue that it&rsquo;s acceptable &ldquo;executive discretion&rdquo; for one president to carve out an exception for up to 1 million people not legally entitled residence in the U.S. but that it&rsquo;s unconstitutional for another duly elected executive to eliminate that same exception? The 9th Circuit did it.</p>\n<p>Now Trump&rsquo;s emergency declaration is, as everyone knew it would be, tangled up in court. That order didn&rsquo;t even affect anyone in the U.S., whether legally here or not. It did nothing more than cobble together funds available to the executive so that Trump might add on to the existing walls and barriers at the southern border, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/texas-border-agents-keep-catching-rapists-child-molesters-and-gang-members-but-democrats-dont-care \">slowing down</a> the drug dealers, human traffickers, and child molesters from Central America.</p>\n<p>Skittish Republicans can keep this in mind when presented with the fake dilemma that they must either choose between the Constitution and the president. They can instead choose reality.</p>",

Trump\u2019s official declaration only means he\u2019s using his last option to address the issue.\nThis isn\u2019t an choice between fidelity to the Constitution or blind loyalty to a president; though I\u2019ll note the executive branch is part of that newly appreciated document, and Congress has already given the president the authority to do exactly what Trump is pursuing. This is a choice about relinquishing authority to Democrats to set immigration policy even while a Republican president is in office.\nObama made up his own law in 2012 that said nearly 1 million eligible illegal immigrants in the U.S. would not only be overlooked by law enforcement but could come out, declare themselves to the public, and receive indefinite legal protection.\nTake for granted that the program was created out of compassion \u2014 plus Obama\u2019s upcoming re-election \u2014 for young immigrants who may only know the U.S. as their home, but it should then also be taken for granted that if one president can dictate immigration policy within the authority Congress has given them, the same right belongs to every other president. Or, at the very least, every other president should be able to exercise power in moving to limit the influx of foreigners by erecting limited structures on the border.\nNot so fast, says the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit!\nThe federal court ruled in November that the Trump administration could not end the Obama-era program with the argument that it was never legal to set it up in the first place. And yet, in the court\u2019s unanimous opinion, it repeatedly acknowledged that the executive branch has the right to determine enforcement of immigration law by way of \u201cexecutive discretion.\u201d\nPage 10: Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \u201cwas a permissible exercise of executive discretion.\u201d\nPage 27: The Reagan administration \u201cexercised executive discretion to defer the deportation of the minor children of non-citizens\u201d and \u201cextended voluntary departure, the mechanism through which these individuals were allowed to remain in the United States is, like deferred action, a creature of executive discretion.\u201d\nPage 69: \u201cWe therefore conclude that DACA was a permissible exercise of executive discretion.\u201d\nWho with a straight face could argue that it\u2019s acceptable \u201cexecutive discretion\u201d for one president to carve out an exception for up to 1 million people not legally entitled residence in the U.S. but that it\u2019s unconstitutional for another duly elected executive to eliminate that same exception? The 9th Circuit did it.\nNow Trump\u2019s emergency declaration is, as everyone knew it would be, tangled up in court. That order didn\u2019t even affect anyone in the U.S., whether legally here or not. It did nothing more than cobble together funds available to the executive so that Trump might add on to the existing walls and barriers at the southern border, slowing down the drug dealers, human traffickers, and child molesters from Central America.\nSkittish Republicans can keep this in mind when presented with the fake dilemma that they must either choose between the Constitution and the president. They can instead choose reality.",

We need to go all the way.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>\n<p>Successful advocacy in Washington still requires pulling the levers of influential members of Congress or officials at government agencies. But Ms. Fisher has discovered that with the Trump administration, the chances of success improve for those who bend the ear of the president and his closest aides.</p>\n<p>Opportunities arise at key gatherings: Fundraisers and parties at the president&rsquo;s private golf courses, or at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., which he has referred to as the Winter White House. Among those attending these events are wealthy supporters. Sheldon Adelson, for example, who successfully pressed for the relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Israel. Or Linda McMahon, a former pro-wrestling executive, who for a time led the U.S. Small Business Association.</p>\n<p>Six months after Ms. Fisher pitched the president at the August 2018 dinner, the administration included her idea in a broader policy statement, seeking public input on requiring the disclosure of negotiated rates. It was the first step in making the rule a possible reality. The administration could issue a rule as early as May 3.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67035?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67035?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67035?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67035?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67035?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67035?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67035?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67035?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Martin Kerans, Ms. Fisher&rsquo;s handyman of 28 years, features prominently in one of her videos illustrating the burden of unexpected medical bills.</h4>   Photo:  Simon Simard for The Wall Street Journal  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>The industry was stunned, with many seeing the idea as radical and disruptive. There could well be political benefits for the Trump administration, with 69% of people saying cutting health-care costs should be a top priority in a January poll by the Pew Research Center. And yet, it also means the administration, in the run-up to the 2020 election, is picking a fight with an industry that donates millions to GOP candidates.</p>\n<p>Ms. Fisher, who is married to Jim Koch, co-founder of Samuel Adams maker <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/SAM\">Boston Beer</a> Co., says it is simplistic to dismiss her approach to advocacy as access to the top by the well-connected. She notes the president is just one part of her strategy; she also met with officials in the White House and in other agencies who were working on the same goal of price transparency. She also promoted her ideas through a series of videos on the subject. But proponents of the effort say the president&rsquo;s support was key.</p>\n<h4>More</h4>\n<p>Ms. Fisher isn&rsquo;t a stranger to the health industry. The former <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/IBM\">IBM</a> sales and marketing executive founded the cord blood stem cell banking company ViaCord Inc. in 1993. She also launched an investment firm, WaterRev, that she says focuses on technologies to enable sustainable water-use practices.</p>\n<p>Former House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) appointed her in 2017 to the Health Information Technology Advisory Committee, which makes recommendations to the administration. She began Patient Rights Advocate Inc., which says it focuses on cost transparency and consumer control of electronic medical information. In 2018, she paid $40,000 to Crowell &amp; Moring to lobby on the issue.</p>\n<p>Ms. Fisher is a major donor, giving almost $1 million to Republicans in the 2018 election cycle and almost $20,000 to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p>\n<p>Ms. Fisher got involved in health-care pricing after her friends and acquaintances shared stories about struggling with the high cost of medical bills. She has since sought to sacrifice &ldquo;her own time and treasure&rdquo; advocating for lower health costs, says Tom Coburn, a former GOP senator who knows her.</p>\n<p>She wanted to illustrate the burden of unexpected medical bills. So she hired a videographer to make clips of people, including individuals she knew, telling stories of the difficulty of meeting the high cost of care. The videos were an integral part of her advocacy efforts. In meetings, she would open her laptop, play one of her videos, and then explain to agency and administration officials how existing, bipartisan law could alleviate the pain of high costs.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67037?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67037?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67037?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67037?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67037?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67037?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67037?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67037?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Mr. Kerans said he was surprised when he went to the White House and staffers recognized him.

Another video features David Tamaroff, a Miami patent lawyer and her nephew, talking about an $18,000 bill he said he received for three genetic tests.</p>\n<p>By January, the idea had momentum, and Mr. Trump&rsquo;s aides were arguing over how much to include in his State of the Union address. In the end, Mr. Trump said hospitals, drug companies and insurers should disclose real prices.</p>\n<p>The administration invited patients on Jan. 23 to talk with Mr. Trump about their unexpected medical bills. The group included some individuals in Ms. Fisher&rsquo;s videos, including Mr. Kerans, the handyman.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kerans said he was surprised when he went to the White House and staffers recognized him. Mr. Trump, he said, walked in and pointed to him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was like when Mick Jagger points at you on stage,&rdquo; Mr. Kerans said.</p>\n<h4>Share Your Thoughts</h4>\n<p><em>Should hospitals be required to publicize the deals they cut with insurance companies?</em> Join the conversation below.</p>\n<p>Once the administration went public with the idea in February, the industry prepared to fight back. Disclosure is supposed to give consumers the ability to make more informed choices, allowing them to save money by price shopping for care. But hospitals argue the administrative costs of disclosure would be cumbersome and costly, and thus offset the positive effects, and wouldn&rsquo;t show consumers how much they would pay out of pocket.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to drive up costs,&rdquo; Rep. Greg Walden (R., Ore.) said in an interview. &ldquo;How do you pull back the curtain and how far?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Trump administration is charging ahead with transparency and competition on a number of fronts, in an effort led by Seema Verma, administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.</p>\n<p>Ms. Fisher said the push has been a collaborative effort with the administration and others focused on price transparency. She believes it can upend the industry.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s at the heart of what the president wants, to let people shop for care,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t shop for care if you don&rsquo;t know what the prices are.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Stephanie Armour at <a href=\"mailto:stephanie.armour@wsj.com\">stephanie.armour@wsj.com</a></p>",

                "text": "As the president talked with guests, Ms. Fisher saw her chance and made the pitch: \u201cHe got it,\u201d she says of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe said, \u2018Let\u2019s make it happen. We need to go all the way.\u2019 \u201d\nSuccessful advocacy in Washington still requires pulling the levers of influential members of Congress or officials at government agencies. But Ms. Fisher has discovered that with the Trump administration, the chances of success improve for those who bend the ear of the president and his closest aides.\nOpportunities arise at key gatherings: Fundraisers and parties at the president\u2019s private golf courses, or at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., which he has referred to as the Winter White House. Among those attending these events are wealthy supporters. Sheldon Adelson, for example, who successfully pressed for the relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Israel. Or Linda McMahon, a former pro-wrestling executive, who for a time led the U.S. Small Business Association.\nSix months after Ms. Fisher pitched the president at the August 2018 dinner, the administration included her idea in a broader policy statement, seeking public input on requiring the disclosure of negotiated rates. It was the first step in making the rule a possible reality. The administration could issue a rule as early as May 3.\nThe industry was stunned, with many seeing the idea as radical and disruptive. There could well be political benefits for the Trump administration, with 69% of people saying cutting health-care costs should be a top priority in a January poll by the Pew Research Center. And yet, it also means the administration, in the run-up to the 2020 election, is picking a fight with an industry that donates millions to GOP candidates.\nMs. Fisher, who is married to Jim Koch, co-founder of Samuel Adams maker Boston Beer Co., says it is simplistic to dismiss her approach to advocacy as access to the top by the well-connected. She notes the president is just one part of her strategy; she also met with officials in the White House and in other agencies who were working on the same goal of price transparency. She also promoted her ideas through a series of videos on the subject. But proponents of the effort say the president\u2019s support was key.\nMore\nMs. Fisher isn\u2019t a stranger to the health industry. The former IBM sales and marketing executive founded the cord blood stem cell banking company ViaCord Inc. in 1993. She also launched an investment firm, WaterRev, that she says focuses on technologies to enable sustainable water-use practices.\nFormer House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) appointed her in 2017 to the Health Information Technology Advisory Committee, which makes recommendations to the administration. She began Patient Rights Advocate Inc., which says it focuses on cost transparency and consumer control of electronic medical information. In 2018, she paid $40,000 to Crowell & Moring to lobby on the issue.\nMs. Fisher is a major donor, giving almost $1 million to Republicans in the 2018 election cycle and almost $20,000 to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nMs. Fisher got involved in health-care pricing after her friends and acquaintances shared stories about struggling with the high cost of medical bills. She has since sought to sacrifice \u201cher own time and treasure\u201d advocating for lower health costs, says Tom Coburn, a former GOP senator who knows her.\nShe wanted to illustrate the burden of unexpected medical bills. So she hired a videographer to make clips of people, including individuals she knew, telling stories of the difficulty of meeting the high cost of care. The videos were an integral part of her advocacy efforts. In meetings, she would open her laptop, play one of her videos, and then explain to agency and administration officials how existing, bipartisan law could alleviate the pain of high costs.\nHer handyman of 28 years, Martin Kerans, features prominently in one of the videos, sitting on the back of his truck and fighting tears as he talks about his bills. Another video features David Tamaroff, a Miami patent lawyer and her nephew, talking about an $18,000 bill he said he received for three genetic tests.\nBy January, the idea had momentum, and Mr. Trump\u2019s aides were arguing over how much to include in his State of the Union address. In the end, Mr. Trump said hospitals, drug companies and insurers should disclose real prices.\nThe administration invited patients on Jan. 23 to talk with Mr. Trump about their unexpected medical bills. The group included some individuals in Ms. Fisher\u2019s videos, including Mr. Kerans, the handyman.\nMr. Kerans said he was surprised when he went to the White House and staffers recognized him. Mr. Trump, he said, walked in and pointed to him.\n\u201cIt was like when Mick Jagger points at you on stage,\u201d Mr. Kerans said.\nShare Your Thoughts\nShould hospitals be required to publicize the deals they cut with insurance companies? Join the conversation below.\nOnce the administration went public with the idea in February, the industry prepared to fight back. Disclosure is supposed to give consumers the ability to make more informed choices, allowing them to save money by price shopping for care. But hospitals argue the administrative costs of disclosure would be cumbersome and costly, and thus offset the positive effects, and wouldn\u2019t show consumers how much they would pay out of pocket.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to drive up costs,\u201d Rep. Greg Walden (R., Ore.) said in an interview. \u201cHow do you pull back the curtain and how far?\u201d\nThe Trump administration is charging ahead with transparency and competition on a number of fronts, in an effort led by Seema Verma, administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.\nMs. Fisher said the push has been a collaborative effort with the administration and others focused on price transparency. She believes it can upend the industry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s at the heart of what the president wants, to let people shop for care,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t shop for care if you don\u2019t know what the prices are.\u201d\nWrite to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com",

Today, he said, if SEIU wants to get rid of a position held by a staffer with five years of tenure, it must offer him or her a new job. Management wants to end that provision, though SEIU says the change would apply only to new hires.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;SEIU is proud of the contract offer it made to staff represented by Local 2,&rdquo; a spokeswoman said Monday, &ldquo;which includes an 8% raise, improved health benefits, and preservation of the job guarantee for all current staff. SEIU has been strongly committed to reaching a negotiated settlement that allows our union to meet the daunting challenges that SEIU members are up against and provides a workplace that is aligned with our values.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This is hardly organized labor&rsquo;s first dose of its own medicine. In 2015 field workers on the &ldquo;Fight for $15&rdquo; complained that they weren&rsquo;t making $15 an hour&mdash;and that they couldn&rsquo;t unionize, since SEIU didn&rsquo;t claim them as employees. An organizer with the Union of Union Representatives lamented then that &ldquo;SEIU has been fostering anti-union sentiment for months.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, OPEIU&rsquo;s Local 2 is in heated negotiations on behalf of the accountants, janitors and so forth that it represents at AFL-CIO. Those employees authorized a strike last October, while making formal complaints of unfair treatment to the National Labor Relations Board.</p>\n<p>Local 2 agreed not to strike in early November, its says, &ldquo;in order not to compromise AFL-CIO&rsquo;s campaign to elect pro-labor candidates.&rdquo; But the contract dispute grinds on. In a January letter, 51 workers complained that &ldquo;AFL-CIO is seeking the right to unilaterally impose up to 24 furlough days over a two-year period.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With all this heavy bargaining, one question is whether OPEIU&rsquo;s and UUR&rsquo;s negotiators are being treated fairly for their hard work. Is there a union for the Union of Union Representatives&rsquo; representatives?</p>\n<p>Appeared in the March 19, 2019, print edition.</p>",

Today, he said, if SEIU wants to get rid of a position held by a staffer with five years of tenure, it must offer him or her a new job. Management wants to end that provision, though SEIU says the change would apply only to new hires.\n\u201cSEIU is proud of the contract offer it made to staff represented by Local 2,\u201d a spokeswoman said Monday, \u201cwhich includes an 8% raise, improved health benefits, and preservation of the job guarantee for all current staff. SEIU has been strongly committed to reaching a negotiated settlement that allows our union to meet the daunting challenges that SEIU members are up against and provides a workplace that is aligned with our values.\u201d\nThis is hardly organized labor\u2019s first dose of its own medicine. In 2015 field workers on the \u201cFight for $15\u201d complained that they weren\u2019t making $15 an hour\u2014and that they couldn\u2019t unionize, since SEIU didn\u2019t claim them as employees. An organizer with the Union of Union Representatives lamented then that \u201cSEIU has been fostering anti-union sentiment for months.\u201d\nMeanwhile, OPEIU\u2019s Local 2 is in heated negotiations on behalf of the accountants, janitors and so forth that it represents at AFL-CIO. Those employees authorized a strike last October, while making formal complaints of unfair treatment to the National Labor Relations Board.\nLocal 2 agreed not to strike in early November, its says, \u201cin order not to compromise AFL-CIO\u2019s campaign to elect pro-labor candidates.\u201d But the contract dispute grinds on. In a January letter, 51 workers complained that \u201cAFL-CIO is seeking the right to unilaterally impose up to 24 furlough days over a two-year period.\u201d\nWith all this heavy bargaining, one question is whether OPEIU\u2019s and UUR\u2019s negotiators are being treated fairly for their hard work. Is there a union for the Union of Union Representatives\u2019 representatives?\nAppeared in the March 19, 2019, print edition.",

Money isn&rsquo;t the only issue, though. &ldquo;The vision the BLM has laid out for Burning Man is not the vision we would choose to produce,&rdquo; Ms. Benson said.</p>\n<p>The proposals are part of a draft environmental-impact statement released by the federal government to help it decide on a request by Burning Man&rsquo;s organizer&mdash;Black Rock City LLC&mdash;to extend its permit through 2028 and increase the number of Burners and support staff allowed in to 100,000 from 80,000.</p>\n<p>The BLM is scheduled to decide on the permit request by early August, a few weeks before this year&rsquo;s event is set to begin. Officials said many of the proposed new security measures wouldn&rsquo;t kick in until next year. If the two sides can&rsquo;t reach a compromise, though, it is possible this year&rsquo;s Burning Man could be the last on federal land.</p>\n<p>Burning Man got its start in San Francisco in 1986 when two friends built a man out of wood and burned it on a beach as part of a summer solstice celebration. The &ldquo;man&rdquo; was ritually burned each year after, in a ceremony that moved to a playa, or dried-up lake bed, in Nevada&rsquo;s Black Rock Desert in 1991 and now lasts eight days.</p>\n<p>At a public hearing on the proposed changes in Lovelock, Nev., on April 9, some Burners were incensed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to kill the event?,&rdquo; asked Cameron Bingham, a 36-year-old substitute teacher who goes by &ldquo;Uncle Buck.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67012?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67012?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67012?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67012?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67012?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67012?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67012?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67012?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>A Bureau of Land Management law-enforcement truck waits out a dust storm during preparations for the annual Burning Man festival in 2018.</h4>   Photo:  BLM/PLANETPIX/ZUMA PRESS  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Mark Hall, a BLM field manager, said his agency doesn&rsquo;t want to end Burning Man, but wants to work with organizers to address safety and sanitation issues. &ldquo;You guys always surprise me with your solutions,&rdquo; he responded.</p>\n<p>Burning Man pumps <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/reno-puts-out-the-welcome-mat-for-burning-man-1503234000?mod=article_inline\">as much as $63 million</a> into Nevada each year, according to the government&rsquo;s environmental report.</p>\n<p>But there is a downside for nearby residents. Though the festival espouses an approach called &ldquo;leave no trace&rdquo; to take out everything brought in, refuse has to go somewhere and often ends up overflowing dumpsters in Reno or Gerlach, population 200, the closest town to the festival.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This town gets trashed,&rdquo; said Melanie McClenahan, a bartender at Bruno&rsquo;s Country Club in Gerlach, where a two-lane road that gets jammed with Burners was nearly empty on a recent afternoon. &ldquo;This is big money for Burning Man and they should be responsible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Burning Man officials estimate it would take more than 1,500 trucks carrying loads of 10 tons each to haul all of the festival&rsquo;s refuse&mdash;a daunting if not impossible task.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Burning Man does everything it can to make its impacts minimal,&rdquo; said Ms. Benson, adding that event volunteers patrol the highways miles around the festival site for trash. &ldquo;We know we can do better.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the era of mass shootings, federal officials worry that Burning Man could be a prime target. Mr. Hall said officials from the Department of Homeland Security advised that physical barriers are needed to prevent someone from driving through a 10-mile perimeter that now has only a plastic fence.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67010?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67010?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67010?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67010?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67010?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67010?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67010?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67010?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>On April 8, nearly 200 Burning Man backers gathered to voice concerns about new conditions and restrictions the government wants to place on the countercultural festival.</h4>   Photo:  Scott Sonner/Associated Press  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Ms. Benson said Burning Man already employs advanced security techniques such as radar monitoring of its perimeter. She added that barriers would be logistically difficult to bring in and could hurt the playa by creating sand dunes.</p>\n<p>Federal officials also recommended private security guards be employed at the event to screen vehicles for weapons and drugs. Currently, Burning Man staff handles the screening of who enters and exits the festival. The event also has patrolling staff on its perimeter.</p>\n<p>At another hearing on April 8 in Sparks, Nev., nearly 200 Burners derided the screening plan as excessive government interference. &ldquo;Tell us how many more rangers we need,&rdquo; Jennifer Kallmes, a veteran attendee, told federal officials. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it ourselves. We don&rsquo;t need you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Becky Andres, a BLM ranger, told the Burners the screening would be to their benefit. &ldquo;This is about helping to keep you safe,&rdquo; she said. The crowd responded with sarcastic laughs.</p>\n<h4>More on Burning Man</h4>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Jim Carlton at <a href=\"mailto:jim.carlton@wsj.com\">jim.carlton@wsj.com</a></p>\n<h4>Share Your Thoughts</h4>\n<p><em>How should the government ensure Burning Man is safe and treats surrounding communities respectfully while still maintaining the event&rsquo;s uniqueness?

Money isn\u2019t the only issue, though. \u201cThe vision the BLM has laid out for Burning Man is not the vision we would choose to produce,\u201d Ms. Benson said.\nThe proposals are part of a draft environmental-impact statement released by the federal government to help it decide on a request by Burning Man\u2019s organizer\u2014Black Rock City LLC\u2014to extend its permit through 2028 and increase the number of Burners and support staff allowed in to 100,000 from 80,000.\nThe BLM is scheduled to decide on the permit request by early August, a few weeks before this year\u2019s event is set to begin. Officials said many of the proposed new security measures wouldn\u2019t kick in until next year. If the two sides can\u2019t reach a compromise, though, it is possible this year\u2019s Burning Man could be the last on federal land.\nBurning Man got its start in San Francisco in 1986 when two friends built a man out of wood and burned it on a beach as part of a summer solstice celebration. The \u201cman\u201d was ritually burned each year after, in a ceremony that moved to a playa, or dried-up lake bed, in Nevada\u2019s Black Rock Desert in 1991 and now lasts eight days.\nAt a public hearing on the proposed changes in Lovelock, Nev., on April 9, some Burners were incensed.\n\u201cAre you trying to kill the event?,\u201d asked Cameron Bingham, a 36-year-old substitute teacher who goes by \u201cUncle Buck.\u201d\nMark Hall, a BLM field manager, said his agency doesn\u2019t want to end Burning Man, but wants to work with organizers to address safety and sanitation issues. \u201cYou guys always surprise me with your solutions,\u201d he responded.\nBurning Man pumps as much as $63 million into Nevada each year, according to the government\u2019s environmental report.\nBut there is a downside for nearby residents. Though the festival espouses an approach called \u201cleave no trace\u201d to take out everything brought in, refuse has to go somewhere and often ends up overflowing dumpsters in Reno or Gerlach, population 200, the closest town to the festival.\n\u201cThis town gets trashed,\u201d said Melanie McClenahan, a bartender at Bruno\u2019s Country Club in Gerlach, where a two-lane road that gets jammed with Burners was nearly empty on a recent afternoon. \u201cThis is big money for Burning Man and they should be responsible.\u201d\nBurning Man officials estimate it would take more than 1,500 trucks carrying loads of 10 tons each to haul all of the festival\u2019s refuse\u2014a daunting if not impossible task.\n\u201cBurning Man does everything it can to make its impacts minimal,\u201d said Ms. Benson, adding that event volunteers patrol the highways miles around the festival site for trash. \u201cWe know we can do better.\u201d\nIn the era of mass shootings, federal officials worry that Burning Man could be a prime target. Mr. Hall said officials from the Department of Homeland Security advised that physical barriers are needed to prevent someone from driving through a 10-mile perimeter that now has only a plastic fence.\nMs. Benson said Burning Man already employs advanced security techniques such as radar monitoring of its perimeter. She added that barriers would be logistically difficult to bring in and could hurt the playa by creating sand dunes.\nFederal officials also recommended private security guards be employed at the event to screen vehicles for weapons and drugs. Currently, Burning Man staff handles the screening of who enters and exits the festival. The event also has patrolling staff on its perimeter.\nAt another hearing on April 8 in Sparks, Nev., nearly 200 Burners derided the screening plan as excessive government interference. \u201cTell us how many more rangers we need,\u201d Jennifer Kallmes, a veteran attendee, told federal officials. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it ourselves. We don\u2019t need you.\u201d\nBecky Andres, a BLM ranger, told the Burners the screening would be to their benefit. \u201cThis is about helping to keep you safe,\u201d she said. The crowd responded with sarcastic laughs.\nMore on Burning Man\nWrite to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com\nShare Your Thoughts\nHow should the government ensure Burning Man is safe and treats surrounding communities respectfully while still maintaining the event\u2019s uniqueness?

But now home prices and rents, higher on average than anywhere else in the country, have surged to the top of concerns for businesses and workers.</p>\n<p>For employers, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re at a crisis stage,&rdquo; said Rob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable, an association of executives. Companies are struggling to recruit or promote from within as people turn down offers to come to California, Mr. Lapsley said. And with the types of jobs being taken out of the state, he added, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not growing the strong middle class that we used to.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Karen Holian, 44 years old, joined the startup Lottery.com when it was founded here in 2015. Though a San Francisco native, Ms. Holian, a marketing manager, was excited when the company last year moved to Austin, Texas, because she could finally plan to buy a home.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In San Francisco, that never seemed like a possibility,&rdquo; she said. A mother of two, she is for now renting a four-bedroom house for $2,000 a month, a third of what a comparable place costs in her hometown.</p>\n<p>Lottery.com CEO Tony DiMatteo said that as the company grew, he found it difficult to persuade current and prospective employees to move to the area. &ldquo;We can give them a much better bang for their buck if we&rsquo;re not in San Francisco,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>The median home price in California in 2018 was $570,010, according to the California Association of Realtors, more than double the nationwide figure. The median price for a house in the Bay Area hovers around $1 million.</p>\n<p>In addition to tech startups like Lottery.com, employers that have moved out of California or stopped adding jobs in the state in the past five years come from such industries as finance, manufacturing, biotech, and food and beverage. They include brokerage firm Charles Schwab &amp; Co., which has focused expansion outside its San Francisco headquarters, and smoothie-maker Jamba Juice, founded in San Luis Obispo, Ca.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/CORE\">Core-Mark Holding</a> Co., which grew from a San Francisco tobacco shop in the 1800s to the second-largest distributor to convenience stores in the U.S., said last year it would relocate to a suburb of Fort Worth, Texas.</p>\n<p>CEO Scott McPherson said recruiting new employees to the Bay Area became challenging given housing prices and long commutes.</p>\n<p>McKesson Corp., the nation&rsquo;s largest pharmaceutical distributor, in November said it would move its global headquarters from San Francisco to the Dallas suburb of Irving, Texas, bringing hundreds of jobs.</p>\n<p>In the Bay Area, the tech industry&rsquo;s historic home, even high-salaried engineers say they are looking to put down roots elsewhere because they can&rsquo;t afford to rent or buy homes near their jobs.</p>\n<p>Carl Guardino, chief executive of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, said CEOs tell him &ldquo;that any new job that doesn&rsquo;t absolutely need to be in the Bay Area is located outside of the Bay Area.&rdquo; The public-policy advisory group counts some 360 companies, including Silicon Valley&rsquo;s largest, as members.</p>\n<figure>An error occurred.

Gavin Newsom&rsquo;s chief business and economic adviser, Lenny Mendonca, says he regularly hears from employers that they can&rsquo;t recruit people because housing costs too much, but &ldquo;in terms of the absolute scale of employment and the number [of companies] that move every year, that is very small.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>California&rsquo;s unemployment rate in January was 4.2%, slightly higher than the national rate. But more than half its renters, and over a third of mortgage-holding homeowners, spend more than 30% of their income on housing, the maximum experts consider affordable, according to the state housing department.</p>\n<p>Mr. Mendonca said California was still creating more companies and jobs than its undersupply of housing can handle. Since taking office in January, Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, has focused on trying to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-to-sue-city-over-lack-of-affordable-housing-11548439811?mod=article_inline\">coax local communities to build more affordable homes </a>more quickly.</p>\n<p>Texas has drawn more companies leaving California over the past decade than any other state, according to research by Joe Vranich, a relocation consultant who encourages businesses to leave California.</p>\n<p>Housing costs are &ldquo;a major selling point for us,&rdquo; said Mike Rosa, senior vice president of economic development for the Dallas Regional Chamber. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a factor in just about every [relocation] search we see.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tech companies searching for talent in other states have taken note.</p>\n<p>Duolingo, a language-learning startup based in Pittsburgh, put up a billboard last year along a San Francisco freeway reading: &ldquo;Own a home. Work in tech. Move to Pittsburgh.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lowell Reade, formerly a user-experience researcher at Facebook, was among Duolingo&rsquo;s recruits. He took a job at the company last year and swapped his $2,300 per-month, 350 square-foot apartment in the city of Palo Alto, Ca., for a three-bedroom in Pittsburgh that rents for $1,800.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was becoming difficult to imagine a future that was appealing to me&rdquo; in Silicon Valley, said Mr. Reade.</p>\n<p>Duolingo put the billboard back up last week.</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Nour Malas at <a href=\"mailto:nour.malas@wsj.com\">nour.malas@wsj.com</a></p>",

Though a San Francisco native, Ms. Holian, a marketing manager, was excited when the company last year moved to Austin, Texas, because she could finally plan to buy a home.\n\u201cIn San Francisco, that never seemed like a possibility,\u201d she said. A mother of two, she is for now renting a four-bedroom house for $2,000 a month, a third of what a comparable place costs in her hometown.\nLottery.com CEO Tony DiMatteo said that as the company grew, he found it difficult to persuade current and prospective employees to move to the area. \u201cWe can give them a much better bang for their buck if we\u2019re not in San Francisco,\u201d he said.\nThe median home price in California in 2018 was $570,010, according to the California Association of Realtors, more than double the nationwide figure. The median price for a house in the Bay Area hovers around $1 million.\nIn addition to tech startups like Lottery.com, employers that have moved out of California or stopped adding jobs in the state in the past five years come from such industries as finance, manufacturing, biotech, and food and beverage. They include brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co., which has focused expansion outside its San Francisco headquarters, and smoothie-maker Jamba Juice, founded in San Luis Obispo, Ca.\nCore-Mark Holding Co., which grew from a San Francisco tobacco shop in the 1800s to the second-largest distributor to convenience stores in the U.S., said last year it would relocate to a suburb of Fort Worth, Texas.\nCEO Scott McPherson said recruiting new employees to the Bay Area became challenging given housing prices and long commutes.\nMcKesson Corp., the nation\u2019s largest pharmaceutical distributor, in November said it would move its global headquarters from San Francisco to the Dallas suburb of Irving, Texas, bringing hundreds of jobs.\nIn the Bay Area, the tech industry\u2019s historic home, even high-salaried engineers say they are looking to put down roots elsewhere because they can\u2019t afford to rent or buy homes near their jobs.\nCarl Guardino, chief executive of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, said CEOs tell him \u201cthat any new job that doesn\u2019t absolutely need to be in the Bay Area is located outside of the Bay Area.\u201d The public-policy advisory group counts some 360 companies, including Silicon Valley\u2019s largest, as members.\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\nThere is no government data on how many companies and jobs have left California.\nAn average of 80,000 homes were built each year in the past decade, far below the 180,000 homes needed year to keep up with population growth through 2025, according to state estimates.\nGov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s chief business and economic adviser, Lenny Mendonca, says he regularly hears from employers that they can\u2019t recruit people because housing costs too much, but \u201cin terms of the absolute scale of employment and the number [of companies] that move every year, that is very small.\u201d\nCalifornia\u2019s unemployment rate in January was 4.2%, slightly higher than the national rate. But more than half its renters, and over a third of mortgage-holding homeowners, spend more than 30% of their income on housing, the maximum experts consider affordable, according to the state housing department.\nMr. Mendonca said California was still creating more companies and jobs than its undersupply of housing can handle. Since taking office in January, Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, has focused on trying to coax local communities to build more affordable homes more quickly.\nTexas has drawn more companies leaving California over the past decade than any other state, according to research by Joe Vranich, a relocation consultant who encourages businesses to leave California.\nHousing costs are \u201ca major selling point for us,\u201d said Mike Rosa, senior vice president of economic development for the Dallas Regional Chamber. \u201cIt\u2019s a factor in just about every [relocation] search we see.\u201d\nTech companies searching for talent in other states have taken note.\nDuolingo, a language-learning startup based in Pittsburgh, put up a billboard last year along a San Francisco freeway reading: \u201cOwn a home. Work in tech. Move to Pittsburgh.\u201d\nLowell Reade, formerly a user-experience researcher at Facebook, was among Duolingo\u2019s recruits. He took a job at the company last year and swapped his $2,300 per-month, 350 square-foot apartment in the city of Palo Alto, Ca., for a three-bedroom in Pittsburgh that rents for $1,800.\n\u201cIt was becoming difficult to imagine a future that was appealing to me\u201d in Silicon Valley, said Mr. Reade.\nDuolingo put the billboard back up last week.\nWrite to Nour Malas at nour.malas@wsj.com",

But, he said, &ldquo;this one felt different.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader said the shotgun was purchased legally at a store in the Littleton, Colo., area, where Columbine High is located. He didn&rsquo;t believe that Ms. Pais had any assistance or friends in Colorado, &ldquo;just a fascination with the Columbine area and the horrendous crime that went on there 20 years ago.&rdquo; He said Ms. Pais had made statements to friends and family in addition to online postings that prompted concern.</p>\n<p>At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, the FBI said Ms. Pais&rsquo;s body was found by a search team near Mount Evans where she had been spotted earlier.</p>\n<p>The FBI was tipped off to Ms. Pais after people who spoke with her reported her obsession with Columbine and unspecified threats to authorities in Florida where she lived.

On Wednesday, with police still unable to locate Ms. Pais, many school officials across the state decided to close for the day. Ms. Pais had last been spotted in the foothills around Denver wearing a black T-shirt, camouflage pants and black boots.\n\u201cWe are relieved that the threat to our schools and community is no longer present,\u201d said Jason Glass, superintendent of the Jefferson County public school district, which includes Columbine High. \u201cWhile this threat has been the most significant, it is not the only challenge facing our schools and our community in these days leading up to the Columbine anniversary.\u201d\nJohn McDonald, who heads school safety for the district, said he was used to threats at Columbine High, which has sometimes drawn people fascinated with the shooting. But, he said, \u201cthis one felt different.\u201d\nJefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader said the shotgun was purchased legally at a store in the Littleton, Colo., area, where Columbine High is located. He didn\u2019t believe that Ms. Pais had any assistance or friends in Colorado, \u201cjust a fascination with the Columbine area and the horrendous crime that went on there 20 years ago.\u201d He said Ms. Pais had made statements to friends and family in addition to online postings that prompted concern.\nAt a news conference Wednesday afternoon, the FBI said Ms. Pais\u2019s body was found by a search team near Mount Evans where she had been spotted earlier.\nThe FBI was tipped off to Ms. Pais after people who spoke with her reported her obsession with Columbine and unspecified threats to authorities in Florida where she lived. Investigators were also concerned her purchase of three one-way tickets on three successive days, said Dean Phillips, special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Denver office.\nMr. Phillips said that he thought the school district made the right call in closing down so many schools in response to Ms. Pais.\n\u201cAs a parent I would say thank you to the school system for protecting my child,\u201d he said.\nWrite to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.com\nAppeared in the April 18, 2019, print edition as 'Woman Accused of Columbine Threats Commits Suicide Woman Infatuated by Columbine Dies Woman \u2018Fascinated\u2019 by \u201999 Shooting Dies.'",

In an interview, Mr. Hoylman said a measure introduced last week that would require New York\u2019s Department of Taxation and Finance to respond to certain congressional subpoenas was gaining steam.\nMr. Trump broke with four decades of tradition in rebuffing calls to release his tax returns, saying they were the subject of an audit.\nWrite to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com",

Hungry for yield, retail investors this week rushed to sign up for the company\u2019s latest bond offering, in which it seeks to raise \u00a5500 billion ($4.5 billion) at a coupon of 1.64%.\nA delay in the Sprint deal could complicate further fundraising and prompt credit-rating firms to take another look at SoftBank\u2019s prospects.\nThe SoftBank group\u2019s finances have been supported by the cash flow from its Japanese mobile-phone carrier, one of the three major operators in the country. But that business could be at risk from Japanese online supermarket operator Rakuten Inc., which plans to challenge mobile carriers with low-cost services targeting the same subscribers as SoftBank.\nWrite to Mayumi Negishi at mayumi.negishi@wsj.com\nAppeared in the April 18, 2019, print edition as 'Merger Setback Could Crimp SoftBank.'",

Mr. Whitesell is executive chairman of the holding company for talent agency William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, whose CEO, Ari Emanuel, is close with Mr. Pecker.</p>\n<p>Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez worked together on some projects and began a relationship last year, a person familiar with the matter has said.

He was concerned Mr. Bezos would sue, forcing debt-laden American Media to expend resources to defend itself for a story executives believed was unlikely to sell well on newsstands. While breaking a story about Mr. Bezos&rsquo; affair would burnish the Enquirer&rsquo;s reputation for breaking news, its readers are historically more interested in showbiz celebrity scandals.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pecker was told by one of his advisers that publishing the story might make it appear he was doing so on behalf of Mr. Trump, who has criticized Mr. Bezos in connection with the Washington Post&rsquo;s coverage of his administration, one of the people said.</p>\n<p>Messrs.

The publisher last year reached a nonprosecution agreement with the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office in Manhattan, admitting it paid $150,000 in 2016 to a former Playboy model to suppress her story of an affair with Mr. Trump a decade earlier, using a tactic known as &ldquo;catch and kill.&rdquo; Mr. Trump has denied the affair.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump has said he had no knowledge of the Enquirer&rsquo;s investigation of Mr. Bezos.</p>\n<p>The pursuit of the Bezos story came in a period of financial strain for the company. Efforts to refinance over $400 million in debt in the early fall were jeopardized when an underwriter backed out in the wake of America Media&rsquo;s legal entanglement in the hush-money case, said a person familiar with the company&rsquo;s finances. The outcome of the crucial refinancing remained uncertain as Mr. Pecker weighed whether to proceed with the explosive story.</p>\n<p>During past refinancings, Mr. Pecker had barred American Media publications from acquiring controversial content or stories that could have imperiled the reshuffling of American Media&rsquo;s debt, said someone familiar with internal discussions at the publisher.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-60722?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-60722?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-60722?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60722?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60722?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60722?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60722?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60722?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>&lsquo;If in my position I can&rsquo;t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?&rsquo; wrote Mr. Bezos, pictured here last September.</h4>   Photo:  Alex Wong/Getty Images  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Despite his qualms, Mr. Pecker approved the $200,000 deal with Mr. Sanchez that had been negotiated by American Media&rsquo;s chief content officer, Mr. Howard; its general counsel for media, Cameron Stracher ; and others, said people familiar with contract. The amount&mdash;higher than the company typically pays sources&mdash;reflected the significance American Media placed on Mr. Sanchez&rsquo;s information.</p>\n<p>Upfront payment</p>\n<p>In most cases, the company&rsquo;s source agreements require it to pay for information upon publication. If a story is never published, American Media doesn&rsquo;t have to pay. By contrast, the contract with Mr. Sanchez stipulated he was to be paid upfront, regardless of whether any story was published, the people familiar with the contract said.</p>\n<p>In light of the recently concluded government investigation, Mr. Stracher, the general counsel, inserted an unusual provision into the Oct. 26 contract with Mr. Sanchez to make it clear the deal wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;catch and kill,&rdquo; those people said.</p>\n<p>If American Media didn&rsquo;t publish anything within about a month&rsquo;s time, Mr. Sanchez could sell the information to another outlet and keep the money, they said. The provision stemmed from concern by American Media employees that Mr. Pecker would buy the story and suppress it because of his relationship with Mr. Emanuel, whose partner is married to Ms. Sanchez, said some of those people.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pecker&rsquo;s relationship with Mr. Emanuel had no bearing on the publisher&rsquo;s decision-making, said people close to Mr. Pecker. A spokesman for Mr. Emanuel said the talent agent had no discussions with Mr. Pecker about the Bezos story before it was published.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL732_BEZOS7_16RH_20190318162751.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL732_BEZOS7_1000V_20190318162751.jpg\" srcset=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL732_BEZOS7_360V_20190318162751.jpg 140w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL732_BEZOS7_4RH_20190318162751.jpg 540w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL732_BEZOS7_1000V_20190318162751.jpg 620w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL732_BEZOS7_574RV_20190318162751.jpg 700w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL732_BEZOS7_750RV_20190318162751.jpg 860w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL732_BEZOS7_16H_20190318162751.jpg 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Michael Sanchez in 2017.</h4>   Photo:  John Sciulli/Getty Images for Politicon  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>As early as October, the Enquirer was trailing Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez to restaurants and hotels and photographing them together, the publication reported. Mr. Sanchez signed the contract with American Media that month, after a few weeks of negotiations, according to one person familiar with the deal.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 7, Messrs. Stracher and Pecker went to lunch at Cipriani Wall Street, a restaurant near American Media&rsquo;s offices, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Stracher, a media-law specialist who had worked for the company for 11 years, had been interested in expanding his role at American Media and believed going into the lunch Mr. Pecker was going to offer him a promotion, said people familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>As they began their meal, Mr. Pecker launched into a discussion of the Sanchez contract. Raising his voice and cursing, Mr. Pecker told Mr. Stracher he had been unaware Mr. Sanchez had been paid upfront, said people familiar with the encounter. Mr. Pecker said the company didn&rsquo;t pay sources upfront and demanded to know why Mr. Stracher hadn&rsquo;t shown him the contract, they said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stracher replied American Media did pay upfront, albeit infrequently, and he routinely dealt with Mr. Howard on contracts. Mr. Pecker told Mr. Stracher if he was unhappy, he could quit.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stracher, taking Mr. Pecker up on the suggestion, walked out of the restaurant. By the time he returned to American Media&rsquo;s offices, less than a 10-minute walk, his keycard had been deactivated, the people familiar with the matter said.</p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal couldn&rsquo;t determine whether anyone at American Media briefed Mr. Pecker on the contract&rsquo;s specifics before it completed the deal with Mr. Sanchez. People close to Mr. Pecker said he wasn&rsquo;t aware the payment was to be made upfront and felt as if he was being forced to run the story.</p>\n<p>American Media paid Mr. Sanchez about a week after the lunch, said people familiar with the deal. By January, after a review of the Enquirer&rsquo;s reporting by an outside law firm, Mr. Pecker tentatively approved publication of the story, some of these people said. American Media&rsquo;s refinancing was finally settled on Jan. 3.</p>\n<p>The Enquirer&rsquo;s 11-page spread on Mr. Bezos&rsquo; affair featured pictures of Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez together, and quotes from his sexually charged text messages. Mr. Bezos&rsquo; security consultant, Gavin de Becker, investigated how American Media had obtained his electronic communications, including whether he had been hacked, and whether its reporting was politically motivated.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL728_BEZOS3_1000RV_20190318162652.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL728_BEZOS3_574V_20190318162652.jpg\" srcset=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL728_BEZOS3_4H_20190318162652.jpg 140w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL728_BEZOS3_360V_20190318162652.jpg 540w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL728_BEZOS3_574V_20190318162652.jpg 860w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL728_BEZOS3_16H_20190318162652.jpg 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Dylan Howard, editor in chief of the National Enquirer, in 2016.</h4>   Photo:  lucas jackson/Reuters  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Amid reports on alleged links between the Enquirer story and Mr. Pecker&rsquo;s actions on behalf of Mr. Trump during the 2016 election, American Media&rsquo;s financial backers at Chatham Asset Management&mdash;who had been unhappy about the Bezos coverage&mdash;conveyed their displeasure and pressured Mr. Pecker to resolve the matter, said people familiar with the communications. Mr. Pecker pressured his staff to do the same.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump fueled the idea the Enquirer had a political agenda, tweeting Jan. 13: &ldquo;So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In early February, an <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirers-years-long-dealings-with-trump-lawyer-fall-under-federal-scrutiny-1532534115?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline\">American Media employee informed Mr. Bezos&rsquo; camp Mr. Pecker was &ldquo;apoplectic&rdquo; about Mr. Bezos&rsquo; investigation</a>, he later recalled in a blog post. Mr. Bezos&rsquo; representatives soon received what they viewed as a verbal threat from AMI: The Enquirer would publish more text messages and pictures if he didn&rsquo;t stop his investigation, Mr. Bezos wrote.</p>\n<p>That was followed by an email to Mr. de Becker&rsquo;s lawyer from Mr. Howard, telling Mr. Bezos in graphic terms of the unpublished material he said the Enquirer held. An <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-amazon-veteran-emerges-as-foe-of-jeff-bezos-11549897200?mod=article_inline\">American Media lawyer, Jon Fine</a>, emailed proposing a confidential settlement. If Mr. Bezos made a statement he had no evidence politics played a role in the Enquirer story and stopped suggesting it had, the tabloid would withhold the rest of Mr. Bezos&rsquo; communications and images, Mr. Fine wrote, according to Mr. Bezos&rsquo; blog post. American Media declined to make Mr. Fine available to comment.</p>\n<p>In a post on online-publishing platform Medium titled &ldquo;No thank you, Mr. Pecker,&rdquo; Mr. Bezos rejected the offer and published the communications sent by American Media, including Mr. Howard&rsquo;s descriptions of his erotic pictures, stirring a new debate over whether the Enquirer tried to blackmail him.</p>\n<p>Mr. Bezos in the blog post also raised Mr. Pecker&rsquo;s past use of the tabloid to aid Mr. Trump and the executive&rsquo;s unsuccessful wooing of Saudi investors for an investment in 2017, further fueling the idea the tabloid had engaged in a political attack.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If in my position I can&rsquo;t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?&rdquo; Mr. Bezos wrote.</p>\n<p>American Media&rsquo;s internal investigation, by an outside law firm, is continuing.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Lukas I.

                "text": "The inside story of the deal between American Media LLC and Mr. Sanchez, brother of Lauren Sanchez, answers many of the central questions in a high-profile fight between the nation\u2019s best-known tabloid and the world\u2019s richest man, including how the Enquirer obtained Bezos\u2019 texts and photos, for how much and why the spat became so bitter and public.\nMr. Sanchez said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cdignify\u201d the Journal\u2019s reporting on the contract he struck. He described the reporting on the contract as \u201cold rumors\u201d from anonymous sources. Mr. Sanchez denied sending \u201cthe many penis selfies\u201d but declined to comment on whether he provided photos of Mr. Bezos to the Enquirer.\nA spokesman for Jeff Bezos declined to comment. Lauren Sanchez didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment sent through an employee at her company and an Amazon spokesman.\nThe deal caused arguments at American Media before the Enquirer published its January story about the affair, these people said. A blowup in a restaurant between American Media Chief Executive David Pecker and his general counsel for media led the lawyer to leave the publisher immediately.\nThe Enquirer approached the Amazon chief for comment on Jan. 7, according to people familiar with the matter. Two days later, Mr. Bezos tweeted that he and his wife MacKenzie were splitting up after 25 years.\nThe Enquirer\u2019s next print edition wasn\u2019t scheduled for publication for several days, and its editors rushed the Bezos story online that night and into print with a headline: \u201cBEZOS\u2019 DIVORCE! THE CHEATING PHOTOS THAT ENDED HIS MARRIAGE.\u201d\nThe full details of the deal and the resulting drama inside the tabloid publisher haven\u2019t been previously reported. In February, the Daily Beast reported Mr. Sanchez had leaked the Bezos texts to the Enquirer. Mr. Pecker declined to be interviewed.\nInside drama\nMr. Sanchez, a talent agent who has managed television pundits and reality-show judges, has long been a source for the Enquirer and its top editor, Dylan Howard, the people familiar with the matter said. He has supported President Trump on Twitter and has ties to conservative activists.\nMr. Sanchez began conversations last fall with the tabloid about his sister\u2019s relationship with Mr. Bezos, the people said. The Enquirer by then had already been investigating whether Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez were having an affair, people familiar with the matter said.\nMs. Sanchez, a former television reporter who started an aerial film-production company, was introduced to Mr. Bezos by her husband, Hollywood talent-agent executive Patrick Whitesell. Mr. Whitesell is executive chairman of the holding company for talent agency William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, whose CEO, Ari Emanuel, is close with Mr. Pecker.\nMr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez worked together on some projects and began a relationship last year, a person familiar with the matter has said. She and her husband are separated.\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\nAs the tabloid publisher began negotiations to buy the materials from Mr. Sanchez in October, Mr. Pecker expressed reservations about publishing a story, the people familiar with the matter said. He was concerned Mr. Bezos would sue, forcing debt-laden American Media to expend resources to defend itself for a story executives believed was unlikely to sell well on newsstands. While breaking a story about Mr. Bezos\u2019 affair would burnish the Enquirer\u2019s reputation for breaking news, its readers are historically more interested in showbiz celebrity scandals.\nMr. Pecker was told by one of his advisers that publishing the story might make it appear he was doing so on behalf of Mr. Trump, who has criticized Mr. Bezos in connection with the Washington Post\u2019s coverage of his administration, one of the people said.\nMessrs. Pecker and Trump have known each other for more than 20 years. Federal prosecutors in New York alleged Mr. Pecker in August 2015 told Mr. Trump he would use his publications to aid Mr. Trump\u2019s nascent presidential campaign.\nAmerican Media has been in the spotlight since it admitted to making a hush payment on behalf of Mr. Trump. The publisher last year reached a nonprosecution agreement with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, admitting it paid $150,000 in 2016 to a former Playboy model to suppress her story of an affair with Mr. Trump a decade earlier, using a tactic known as \u201ccatch and kill.\u201d Mr. Trump has denied the affair.\nMr. Trump has said he had no knowledge of the Enquirer\u2019s investigation of Mr. Bezos.\nThe pursuit of the Bezos story came in a period of financial strain for the company. Efforts to refinance over $400 million in debt in the early fall were jeopardized when an underwriter backed out in the wake of America Media\u2019s legal entanglement in the hush-money case, said a person familiar with the company\u2019s finances. The outcome of the crucial refinancing remained uncertain as Mr. Pecker weighed whether to proceed with the explosive story.\nDuring past refinancings, Mr. Pecker had barred American Media publications from acquiring controversial content or stories that could have imperiled the reshuffling of American Media\u2019s debt, said someone familiar with internal discussions at the publisher.\nDespite his qualms, Mr. Pecker approved the $200,000 deal with Mr. Sanchez that had been negotiated by American Media\u2019s chief content officer, Mr. Howard; its general counsel for media, Cameron Stracher ; and others, said people familiar with contract. The amount\u2014higher than the company typically pays sources\u2014reflected the significance American Media placed on Mr. Sanchez\u2019s information.\nUpfront payment\nIn most cases, the company\u2019s source agreements require it to pay for information upon publication. If a story is never published, American Media doesn\u2019t have to pay. By contrast, the contract with Mr. Sanchez stipulated he was to be paid upfront, regardless of whether any story was published, the people familiar with the contract said.\nIn light of the recently concluded government investigation, Mr. Stracher, the general counsel, inserted an unusual provision into the Oct. 26 contract with Mr. Sanchez to make it clear the deal wasn\u2019t a \u201ccatch and kill,\u201d those people said.\nIf American Media didn\u2019t publish anything within about a month\u2019s time, Mr. Sanchez could sell the information to another outlet and keep the money, they said. The provision stemmed from concern by American Media employees that Mr. Pecker would buy the story and suppress it because of his relationship with Mr. Emanuel, whose partner is married to Ms. Sanchez, said some of those people.\nMr. Pecker\u2019s relationship with Mr. Emanuel had no bearing on the publisher\u2019s decision-making, said people close to Mr. Pecker. A spokesman for Mr. Emanuel said the talent agent had no discussions with Mr. Pecker about the Bezos story before it was published.\nAs early as October, the Enquirer was trailing Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez to restaurants and hotels and photographing them together, the publication reported. Mr. Sanchez signed the contract with American Media that month, after a few weeks of negotiations, according to one person familiar with the deal.\nOn Nov. 7, Messrs. Stracher and Pecker went to lunch at Cipriani Wall Street, a restaurant near American Media\u2019s offices, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Stracher, a media-law specialist who had worked for the company for 11 years, had been interested in expanding his role at American Media and believed going into the lunch Mr. Pecker was going to offer him a promotion, said people familiar with the matter.\nAs they began their meal, Mr. Pecker launched into a discussion of the Sanchez contract. Raising his voice and cursing, Mr. Pecker told Mr. Stracher he had been unaware Mr. Sanchez had been paid upfront, said people familiar with the encounter. Mr. Pecker said the company didn\u2019t pay sources upfront and demanded to know why Mr. Stracher hadn\u2019t shown him the contract, they said.\nMr. Stracher replied American Media did pay upfront, albeit infrequently, and he routinely dealt with Mr. Howard on contracts. Mr. Pecker told Mr. Stracher if he was unhappy, he could quit.\nMr. Stracher, taking Mr. Pecker up on the suggestion, walked out of the restaurant. By the time he returned to American Media\u2019s offices, less than a 10-minute walk, his keycard had been deactivated, the people familiar with the matter said.\nThe Wall Street Journal couldn\u2019t determine whether anyone at American Media briefed Mr. Pecker on the contract\u2019s specifics before it completed the deal with Mr. Sanchez. People close to Mr. Pecker said he wasn\u2019t aware the payment was to be made upfront and felt as if he was being forced to run the story.\nAmerican Media paid Mr. Sanchez about a week after the lunch, said people familiar with the deal. By January, after a review of the Enquirer\u2019s reporting by an outside law firm, Mr. Pecker tentatively approved publication of the story, some of these people said. American Media\u2019s refinancing was finally settled on Jan. 3.\nThe Enquirer\u2019s 11-page spread on Mr. Bezos\u2019 affair featured pictures of Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez together, and quotes from his sexually charged text messages. Mr. Bezos\u2019 security consultant, Gavin de Becker, investigated how American Media had obtained his electronic communications, including whether he had been hacked, and whether its reporting was politically motivated.\nAmid reports on alleged links between the Enquirer story and Mr. Pecker\u2019s actions on behalf of Mr. Trump during the 2016 election, American Media\u2019s financial backers at Chatham Asset Management\u2014who had been unhappy about the Bezos coverage\u2014conveyed their displeasure and pressured Mr. Pecker to resolve the matter, said people familiar with the communications. Mr. Pecker pressured his staff to do the same.\nMr. Trump fueled the idea the Enquirer had a political agenda, tweeting Jan. 13: \u201cSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post.\u201d\nIn early February, an American Media employee informed Mr. Bezos\u2019 camp Mr. Pecker was \u201capoplectic\u201d about Mr. Bezos\u2019 investigation, he later recalled in a blog post. Mr. Bezos\u2019 representatives soon received what they viewed as a verbal threat from AMI: The Enquirer would publish more text messages and pictures if he didn\u2019t stop his investigation, Mr. Bezos wrote.\nThat was followed by an email to Mr. de Becker\u2019s lawyer from Mr. Howard, telling Mr. Bezos in graphic terms of the unpublished material he said the Enquirer held. An American Media lawyer, Jon Fine, emailed proposing a confidential settlement. If Mr. Bezos made a statement he had no evidence politics played a role in the Enquirer story and stopped suggesting it had, the tabloid would withhold the rest of Mr. Bezos\u2019 communications and images, Mr. Fine wrote, according to Mr. Bezos\u2019 blog post. American Media declined to make Mr. Fine available to comment.\nIn a post on online-publishing platform Medium titled \u201cNo thank you, Mr. Pecker,\u201d Mr. Bezos rejected the offer and published the communications sent by American Media, including Mr. Howard\u2019s descriptions of his erotic pictures, stirring a new debate over whether the Enquirer tried to blackmail him.\nMr. Bezos in the blog post also raised Mr. Pecker\u2019s past use of the tabloid to aid Mr. Trump and the executive\u2019s unsuccessful wooing of Saudi investors for an investment in 2017, further fueling the idea the tabloid had engaged in a political attack.\n\u201cIf in my position I can\u2019t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote.\nAmerican Media\u2019s internal investigation, by an outside law firm, is continuing.\n\u2014Lukas I.

                "html": "<p>City officials expect the number of measles cases to increase over the next several weeks partly because of gatherings over the holidays, said Herminia Palacio, the city&rsquo;s deputy mayor for health and human services. The outbreak is worst in ultra-Orthodox communities in Brooklyn, N.Y., and nearby Rockland County.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very concerned about Passover,&rdquo; Dr. Palacio said.</p>\n<p>Passover begins Friday and ends Saturday evening, April 27. The holiday commemorates the exodus of Hebrews from Egypt.</p>\n<p>There are now 329 reported cases of measles in New York City, the country&rsquo;s largest outbreak site, with a spike seen after the Purim holiday in mid-March, New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene officials said. Overall, the number of new measles cases is continuing to accelerate across the U.S., for a total of 555 in 20 states.</p>\n<h4>Share Your Thoughts</h4>\n<p><em>How can public health officials engage a community to tackle a public health emergency? Join the conversation below.</em></p>\n<p>Pediatricians are urging parents in affected communities to get an early dose of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine for babies that are six months and older; in certain sections of the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn the vaccine is mandated by a commissioner&rsquo;s order issued last week that will <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-extends-order-for-mandatory-measles-vaccinations-11555534439?mod=article_inline\">continue until the outbreak is declared over</a>.</p>\n<p>In a presentation Wednesday before the city&rsquo;s Board of Health, officials for the health department reported that there have been around 200 vaccines administered since the emergency order.</p>\n<p>In Williamsburg, Victor Friedman&rsquo;s family will be celebrating the first Seder of Passover at his parent&rsquo;s home nearby. It is a gathering that should include four or six other families, and at least 20 people, with a dinner that will stretch on for four or five hours, he said.</p>\n<p>He has checked with all of the other families if they vaccinate their children and did the same with the families that live in his 10-apartment building. With an infant son too young to be vaccinated, he said, he couldn&rsquo;t take the risk and was relieved to find out that everyone vaccinates. But, he said, he and his wife will be &ldquo;very careful with other places we go.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are trying to do our best to gather information,&rdquo; Mr. Friedman said. &ldquo;If someone is not vaccinated or might have symptoms, we will be on top of it.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Photos: Williamsburg Reacts to Mandatory Vaccinations</h2>\n<h2>Residents weigh in on the mandatory measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations and fines for noncompliance in certain areas of Brooklyn</h2>\n<figure><img alt=\"Slide 3\" src=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DS352_quote__NS_20190415115900.png\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Slide 4\" src=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DS356_quote__NS_20190415120406.png\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Slide 5\" src=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DS684_quote__NS_20190416130955.png\"></img></figure>\n<p>1 of 6</p>\n<p>Medical professionals who serve the Orthodox community and rabbinical authorities have called on parents to vaccinate their children, said Rabbi David Zwiebel, executive vice president of Agudath Israel of America. &ldquo;The large majority of Jewish schoolchildren are indeed vaccinated.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But many schools are closed during Passover so the city&rsquo;s recent measures to prod people into vaccination won&rsquo;t work, said Gerald Schulman, a pediatrician with an office in the Williamsburg and Midwood neighborhoods of Brooklyn. Parents have called him to ask about what to do about coming travel, including trips to Israel where there is a large measles outbreak.</p>\n<p>He said he tells his patients to get their children vaccinated and, for those with very young babies, to avoid crowded areas and large groups, stand off to the side and &ldquo;maybe you don&rsquo;t take your four-month-old everywhere.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of guidelines. I really tell parents it&rsquo;s a personal issue,&rdquo; said Dr. Schulman. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way for me to estimate the risk.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For the upcoming Chol Hamoed, also known as the &ldquo;intermediate days&rdquo; between the two Sabbath weekends of Passover, there will be a trip to a New Jersey amusement park organized for teens by NCSY, formerly known as the National Conference of Synagogue Youth. Rabbi Micah Greenland, who leads that group, said that in emailed messages about the trip, there will be a notice about making sure children are up-to-date on vaccines or, if the child has viruslike symptoms, to avoid the event.</p>\n<p>Arona Berow, 39, who is due with her second child in May, said she won&rsquo;t visit her parents who live in Rockland County for Passover. Ms. Berow lives in an Orthodox area of Washington Heights, N.Y.</p>\n<h4>Related</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;Thank God there are no known cases of the measles where I live,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But my area, everyone clears out for Passover. I&rsquo;m actually worried about after the holiday. People are traveling, what are they going to bring back?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Motty Jacobson, 27, said he, his wife and two young children typically spend the intermediate days of Passover at New York City parks and zoos or visiting museums. While his children are up-to-date on their vaccinations, Mr. Jacobson said he is worried about exposure to measles and will likely stay home and do arts and crafts or go somewhere remote.</p>\n<p>Mr. Jacobson, though, said he has no plans to avoid synagogue during Passover.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You have to go pray. I&rsquo;m not going to totally lose myself and be hysterical about it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just hope rabbis hang up signs in their synagogues saying, &lsquo;If you did not vaccinate your children or if you yourself aren&rsquo;t vaccinated, please don&rsquo;t pray here.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Melanie Grayce West at <a href=\"mailto:melanie.west@wsj.com\">melanie.west@wsj.com</a> and Kate King at <a href=\"mailto:Kate.King@wsj.com\">Kate.King@wsj.com</a></p>",

The outbreak is worst in ultra-Orthodox communities in Brooklyn, N.Y., and nearby Rockland County.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about Passover,\u201d Dr. Palacio said.\nPassover begins Friday and ends Saturday evening, April 27. The holiday commemorates the exodus of Hebrews from Egypt.\nThere are now 329 reported cases of measles in New York City, the country\u2019s largest outbreak site, with a spike seen after the Purim holiday in mid-March, New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene officials said. Overall, the number of new measles cases is continuing to accelerate across the U.S., for a total of 555 in 20 states.\nShare Your Thoughts\nHow can public health officials engage a community to tackle a public health emergency? Join the conversation below.\nPediatricians are urging parents in affected communities to get an early dose of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine for babies that are six months and older; in certain sections of the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn the vaccine is mandated by a commissioner\u2019s order issued last week that will continue until the outbreak is declared over.\nIn a presentation Wednesday before the city\u2019s Board of Health, officials for the health department reported that there have been around 200 vaccines administered since the emergency order.\nIn Williamsburg, Victor Friedman\u2019s family will be celebrating the first Seder of Passover at his parent\u2019s home nearby. It is a gathering that should include four or six other families, and at least 20 people, with a dinner that will stretch on for four or five hours, he said.\nHe has checked with all of the other families if they vaccinate their children and did the same with the families that live in his 10-apartment building. With an infant son too young to be vaccinated, he said, he couldn\u2019t take the risk and was relieved to find out that everyone vaccinates. But, he said, he and his wife will be \u201cvery careful with other places we go.\u201d\n\u201cWe are trying to do our best to gather information,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. \u201cIf someone is not vaccinated or might have symptoms, we will be on top of it.\u201d\nPhotos: Williamsburg Reacts to Mandatory Vaccinations\nResidents weigh in on the mandatory measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations and fines for noncompliance in certain areas of Brooklyn\n1 of 6\nMedical professionals who serve the Orthodox community and rabbinical authorities have called on parents to vaccinate their children, said Rabbi David Zwiebel, executive vice president of Agudath Israel of America. \u201cThe large majority of Jewish schoolchildren are indeed vaccinated.\u201d\nBut many schools are closed during Passover so the city\u2019s recent measures to prod people into vaccination won\u2019t work, said Gerald Schulman, a pediatrician with an office in the Williamsburg and Midwood neighborhoods of Brooklyn. Parents have called him to ask about what to do about coming travel, including trips to Israel where there is a large measles outbreak.\nHe said he tells his patients to get their children vaccinated and, for those with very young babies, to avoid crowded areas and large groups, stand off to the side and \u201cmaybe you don\u2019t take your four-month-old everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, there aren\u2019t a lot of guidelines. I really tell parents it\u2019s a personal issue,\u201d said Dr. Schulman. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for me to estimate the risk.\u201d\nFor the upcoming Chol Hamoed, also known as the \u201cintermediate days\u201d between the two Sabbath weekends of Passover, there will be a trip to a New Jersey amusement park organized for teens by NCSY, formerly known as the National Conference of Synagogue Youth. Rabbi Micah Greenland, who leads that group, said that in emailed messages about the trip, there will be a notice about making sure children are up-to-date on vaccines or, if the child has viruslike symptoms, to avoid the event.\nArona Berow, 39, who is due with her second child in May, said she won\u2019t visit her parents who live in Rockland County for Passover. Ms. Berow lives in an Orthodox area of Washington Heights, N.Y.\nRelated\n\u201cThank God there are no known cases of the measles where I live,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my area, everyone clears out for Passover. I\u2019m actually worried about after the holiday. People are traveling, what are they going to bring back?\u201d\nMotty Jacobson, 27, said he, his wife and two young children typically spend the intermediate days of Passover at New York City parks and zoos or visiting museums. While his children are up-to-date on their vaccinations, Mr. Jacobson said he is worried about exposure to measles and will likely stay home and do arts and crafts or go somewhere remote.\nMr. Jacobson, though, said he has no plans to avoid synagogue during Passover.\n\u201cYou have to go pray. I\u2019m not going to totally lose myself and be hysterical about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hope rabbis hang up signs in their synagogues saying, \u2018If you did not vaccinate your children or if you yourself aren\u2019t vaccinated, please don\u2019t pray here.\u2019\u201d\nWrite to Melanie Grayce West at melanie.west@wsj.com and Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com",

He doubled down on wealth management, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703386704576186712848163874?mod=article_inline\">buying Smith Barney</a>, and fired 25% of bond traders and shed risky assets including real estate and oil tankers.</p>\n<p>Aided by a benign economic backdrop, the effort has mostly worked, producing steady profits and few of the ugly surprises the plagued Morgan Stanley in the past.</p>\n<p>That makeover was tested in the first quarter, though.</p>\n<p>Stock-trading desks were quieted by calm markets. Revenue in that business, where Morgan Stanley is the largest on Wall Street, fell 21%, mirroring drops at peers including <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/GS\">Goldman Sachs Group</a> Inc. and JPMorgan.</p>\n<p>Merger fees fell 29% as fewer previously announced deals were completed in the quarter. Morgan Stanley has fallen further behind rival Goldman in M&amp;A revenue. The gap between the two banks&rsquo; trailing-year deal fees has now doubled since late 2017, to $1.5 billion.</p>\n<p>Overall, investment-banking revenue, which contributes about 15% of Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s revenue, fell by one-quarter from a year earlier.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There was a little bit of a hangover&rdquo; from December&rsquo;s market swoon &ldquo;and IPO volumes fell off a cliff,&rdquo; Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said in an interview.</p>\n<p>He said the firm&rsquo;s pipeline of coming initial public offerings was healthy. Morgan Stanley has led roles on IPOs for Zoom Video Communications Inc., which will <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/pinterest-and-zoom-to-test-ipo-market-after-lyfts-stumble-11555493401?mod=article_inline&mod=hp_lead_pos1&mod=article_inline\">start trading this week</a>, and Uber Technologies Inc., expected <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-discloses-ipo-filing-11555015305?mod=article_inline\">to hit the markets</a> next month.</p>\n<p>The stock-market tumble in late 2018 also shaved tens of billions of dollars of value off the $1.1 trillion in wealth-management portfolios on which Morgan Stanley charges flat fees. Revenue in that business was flat from a year ago, at $4.4 billion.</p>\n<p>Asset management, Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s smallest business and one it has been trying to grow, posted a 12% revenue increase, though clients pulled about $6 billion in assets.</p>\n<p>The firm has been on the hunt for acquisitions, though Mr. Gorman said Wednesday that he is &ldquo;not compulsively trying to buy stuff.&rdquo; Any deal would have to either meaningfully bulk up an existing business, like its 2010 deal for Smith Barney, or fill a hole in its existing offering, like a small acquisition in 2018 of a real-estate investment firm.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Where we see things that we think are smart and can fit on the platform, are culturally good fits, we&rsquo;ll go for it,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Return on equity, a closely watched measure of profitability, was 13.1%, ahead of Mr. Gorman&rsquo;s medium-term top goal of 13%, though with the help of a lower tax rate.</p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley, with a smaller lending book than peers, is less sensitive to interest-rate surprises and was less rattled by the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s signals that it wouldn&rsquo;t increase rates this year. It has been raising deposits and pushing mortgages and other loans to its wealth-management clients, but is still small in the lending business. The bank outsources much of its corporate lending to <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/MUFG\">Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group</a>, the Japanese bank that is a 20% shareholder in Morgan Stanley.</p>\n<h4>Read more</h4>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Liz Hoffman at <a href=\"mailto:liz.hoffman@wsj.com\">liz.hoffman@wsj.com</a></p>",

They are down about 18% from highs last spring.\nMorgan Stanley wrapped up a big-banks earnings season that investors viewed as mostly underwhelming. Big banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. fared better as their giant consumer businesses balanced out slower trading and capital markets activity.\nJames Gorman, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief executive since 2010, has rebuilt the firm to be able to do well in all kinds of markets. He doubled down on wealth management, buying Smith Barney, and fired 25% of bond traders and shed risky assets including real estate and oil tankers.\nAided by a benign economic backdrop, the effort has mostly worked, producing steady profits and few of the ugly surprises the plagued Morgan Stanley in the past.\nThat makeover was tested in the first quarter, though.\nStock-trading desks were quieted by calm markets. Revenue in that business, where Morgan Stanley is the largest on Wall Street, fell 21%, mirroring drops at peers including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan.\nMerger fees fell 29% as fewer previously announced deals were completed in the quarter. Morgan Stanley has fallen further behind rival Goldman in M&A revenue. The gap between the two banks\u2019 trailing-year deal fees has now doubled since late 2017, to $1.5 billion.\nOverall, investment-banking revenue, which contributes about 15% of Morgan Stanley\u2019s revenue, fell by one-quarter from a year earlier.\n\u201cThere was a little bit of a hangover\u201d from December\u2019s market swoon \u201cand IPO volumes fell off a cliff,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said in an interview.\nHe said the firm\u2019s pipeline of coming initial public offerings was healthy. Morgan Stanley has led roles on IPOs for Zoom Video Communications Inc., which will start trading this week, and Uber Technologies Inc., expected to hit the markets next month.\nThe stock-market tumble in late 2018 also shaved tens of billions of dollars of value off the $1.1 trillion in wealth-management portfolios on which Morgan Stanley charges flat fees. Revenue in that business was flat from a year ago, at $4.4 billion.\nAsset management, Morgan Stanley\u2019s smallest business and one it has been trying to grow, posted a 12% revenue increase, though clients pulled about $6 billion in assets.\nThe firm has been on the hunt for acquisitions, though Mr. Gorman said Wednesday that he is \u201cnot compulsively trying to buy stuff.\u201d Any deal would have to either meaningfully bulk up an existing business, like its 2010 deal for Smith Barney, or fill a hole in its existing offering, like a small acquisition in 2018 of a real-estate investment firm.\n\u201cWhere we see things that we think are smart and can fit on the platform, are culturally good fits, we\u2019ll go for it,\u201d he said.\nReturn on equity, a closely watched measure of profitability, was 13.1%, ahead of Mr. Gorman\u2019s medium-term top goal of 13%, though with the help of a lower tax rate.\nMorgan Stanley, with a smaller lending book than peers, is less sensitive to interest-rate surprises and was less rattled by the Federal Reserve\u2019s signals that it wouldn\u2019t increase rates this year. It has been raising deposits and pushing mortgages and other loans to its wealth-management clients, but is still small in the lending business. The bank outsources much of its corporate lending to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the Japanese bank that is a 20% shareholder in Morgan Stanley.\nRead more\nWrite to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com",

Paintings, statues and other valuables were passed hand-to-hand along a human chain to get them out of the fire&rsquo;s path.</p>\n<p>Time was short. In the space of less than two hours, the blaze would bring down the cathedral&rsquo;s central spire along with most of its roof. That debris crashed through the church&rsquo;s limestone ceiling, creating crater-sized holes and burying the altar in a giant ash heap. French officials have said that damage is now testing the integrity of Notre Dame&rsquo;s stone walls, particularly its northern transept.</p>\n<p>As engineers surveyed the damage on Tuesday, they found stained-glass windows damaged by fire and a series of large-scale paintings tarnished by smoke.

Firefighters sprayed their hoses to create a curtain of water shielding the cathedral&rsquo;s soaring western facade and the belfries that frame it.</p>\n<p>That effort secured the 13-ton, five-century-old tenor bell that chimed at the coronation of French kings as well as at the end of both World Wars. The facade also features one of the edifice&rsquo;s three rose-shaped stained-glass windows, considered some of the finest masterpieces of medieval art.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the water wall, the fire raged on, fueled by 1,400 oak beams, several of them 800 years old.</p>\n<p>Those beams, known as &ldquo;the forest,&rdquo; made up a web of wood armature that separated the church&rsquo;s limestone structure from its sloping metal roof. That dry, airy space turned the massive timbers into kindling, experts said, intensifying the blaze.</p>\n<p>As the sun set, columns of fire surged to the top of Notre Dame&rsquo;s central spire where a weather vane in the shape of a rooster, forged from copper, had overlooked the city for decades. Inside the weather vane was a piece of the crown of thorns, packed inside with other relics in the 1930s.</p>\n<p>Thousands of people gathered across the banks of the River Seine to watch as the lead plates forming the spire melted, causing it to buckle.</p>\n<p>Inside the church, meanwhile, firefighters had formed a human chain that ferried artworks from the cathedral to trucks bound for city hall.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Saving the artwork is a difficult maneuver, it&rsquo;s being carried out in smoke, with falling materials, notably melted lead,&rdquo; said Jean-Claude Gallet, the commander of the Paris firefighting brigade.</p>\n<p>Both the crown of thorns and the tunic of St. Louis, a canonized French king, were among the valuables that made it out of the cathedral&rsquo;s treasury, French officials said.</p>\n<p>At 8:05 p.m., the spire collapsed, forcing firefighters out of the building to be replaced by a remote-controlled water cannon.</p>\n<p>By the time the sun rose Tuesday morning over the smoldering edifice, major questions remained.</p>\n<p>A handbook endorsed by France&rsquo;s culture ministry advises contractors to fill out a fire permit for any work on a historic building that involves an open flame.</p>\n<p>Workers are also instructed to remain on-site for at least two hours after finishing work involving flames or high heat, and to keep fire extinguishers on hand in case a fire breaks out.</p>\n<h4>Related</h4>\n<p>Julien Le Bras of Le Bras Fr&egrave;res, one of the contractors involved in the renovation, said none of his workers were at the site at the time the fire broke out, adding that all safety norms were followed.</p>\n<p>Didier Durand, chairman of stoneworks company Pierrenoel, had worked through Monday night to evacuate the treasury before returning to the cathedral Tuesday to focus on the northern transept, which remains at risk of collapse.</p>\n<p>Perched about 130 feet above the ground, Mr. Durand and his team delicately removed a statue at the transept&rsquo;s apex to prevent it from pulling down the ceiling.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yesterday we were completely annihilated. Today we are stabilizing,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>At around 8 a.m., before the fire was entirely extinguished, Laurent Nu&ntilde;ez, an official at the interior ministry, which oversees the fire brigade, convened a status meeting with architects that specialize in historical monuments to figure out the next steps.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The goal was to assure that the building wouldn&rsquo;t fail,&rdquo; Mr. Nu&ntilde;ez later said.</p>\n<p>The verdict: there were &ldquo;a few vulnerabilities&rdquo;&mdash;particularly the apex of the cathedral&rsquo;s northern transept, which was at risk of crumbling, Mr. Nu&ntilde;ez said. There the vaulted stone ceiling of the cathedral had collapsed, leaving the rest of the ceiling fragile. As a precaution, emergency workers cleared people from five buildings near the transept in case it gave way, Mr. Nu&ntilde;ez said.</p>\n<figure>An error occurred.

Photo: Associated Press </figcaption></figure>\n<p>At the same time, another danger emerged: In dousing parts of the cathedral to contain the blaze, firefighters had soaked centuries-old stones, adding to their weight in a way that could change the balance of the building.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Necessarily there will be some settling, and that poses a risk,&rdquo; said Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric L&eacute;toff&eacute;, president of GMH, a trade group for French companies that restore historic monuments. A large amount of water had also collected on top of the weakened ceilings along the main nave, he added.</p>\n<p>It was with those dangers in mind that Jos&eacute; Vaz de Matos, a fire-security expert for the French culture ministry, climbed up into the building&rsquo;s two massive belfries on a reconnaissance mission with experts from Paris city hall and the culture ministry, he said later that morning.</p>\n<p>The goal was to make a quick assessment so officials could decide where to focus their resources.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Remarkably, we were able to determine that the fundamental elements of the edifice known world-wide&mdash;the belfries&mdash;have been secured,&rdquo; Mr. Vaz de Matos later said.</p>\n<p>Later in the day, a restorer at the site found the copper weather vane that had topped the fallen spire and was thought lost.</p>\n<p>Though damaged from the heat and the fall, it was still recognizable as it was returned to the cathedral&rsquo;s chief architect.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It may still contain its relics,&rdquo; Mr. Durand said. &ldquo;Tomorrow we will start rebuilding.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67241?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67241?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-67241?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67241?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67241?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67241?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67241?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-67241?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>A composite showing people attending a Mass at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on April 7, 2018, and the fire at the same location on Monday.</h4>   Photo:  From left: Pedro Fiuza/NurPhoto/Getty Images; YOAN VALAT/EPA/Shutterstock  </figcaption></figure>\n<h4>Share Your Thoughts</h4>\n<p><em>How much do you value the preservation of historic structures like Notre Dame for future generations?

Paintings, statues and other valuables were passed hand-to-hand along a human chain to get them out of the fire\u2019s path.\nTime was short. In the space of less than two hours, the blaze would bring down the cathedral\u2019s central spire along with most of its roof. That debris crashed through the church\u2019s limestone ceiling, creating crater-sized holes and burying the altar in a giant ash heap. French officials have said that damage is now testing the integrity of Notre Dame\u2019s stone walls, particularly its northern transept.\nAs engineers surveyed the damage on Tuesday, they found stained-glass windows damaged by fire and a series of large-scale paintings tarnished by smoke. President Emmanuel Macron vowed that France would restore the monument within five years. \u201cWe will rebuild the cathedral and make it even more beautiful,\u201d he said in a televised national address on Tuesday.\nFrance\u2019s private sector pledged to help.\nBernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, said his family and the luxury-goods company it controls would donate \u20ac200 million ($226 million) to rebuild the cathedral.\nNotre Dame Cathedral Burns in Paris\nHistoric Gothic structure is world renowned and attracts millions of visitors each year\nAn aerial shot shows the fire damage to Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on Tuesday.\nGigarama/Associated Press\n1 of 23\nKering SA chairman and chief executive Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, a fellow billionaire, said his family, which controls LVMH\u2019s rival, would donate \u20ac100 million to the effort. French energy giant Total SA also said it planned to donate \u20ac100 million.\nOn Tuesday, investigators were interviewing nearly 15 workers who had been working on a restoration of the cathedral before the blaze, said R\u00e9my Heitz, the Paris prosecutor.\nNearly 50 investigators are involved in the probe, he said, adding they wouldn\u2019t be able to access the building until it is deemed secure.\n\u201cNothing for the moment indicates any voluntary act,\u201d Mr. Heitz said. \u201cThe primary theory is that the fire began in the wooden frame, linked to the ongoing renovation.\u201d\nView Photos\nVisual Chronicle of European Church Disasters\nVIEW Photos\nAlamy\nAfter the fire alarm first sounded, firefighters arriving at the scene began to execute a rescue plan years in the making.\nParisian firefighters are trained to cover precious objects using water and fire-repellant blankets and, if possible, carry them to safety, according to Gilles Glin, chief of the Paris fire department until 2014.\nThe first order of business, however, was to contain the blaze. Firefighters sprayed their hoses to create a curtain of water shielding the cathedral\u2019s soaring western facade and the belfries that frame it.\nThat effort secured the 13-ton, five-century-old tenor bell that chimed at the coronation of French kings as well as at the end of both World Wars. The facade also features one of the edifice\u2019s three rose-shaped stained-glass windows, considered some of the finest masterpieces of medieval art.\nOn the other side of the water wall, the fire raged on, fueled by 1,400 oak beams, several of them 800 years old.\nThose beams, known as \u201cthe forest,\u201d made up a web of wood armature that separated the church\u2019s limestone structure from its sloping metal roof. That dry, airy space turned the massive timbers into kindling, experts said, intensifying the blaze.\nAs the sun set, columns of fire surged to the top of Notre Dame\u2019s central spire where a weather vane in the shape of a rooster, forged from copper, had overlooked the city for decades. Inside the weather vane was a piece of the crown of thorns, packed inside with other relics in the 1930s.\nThousands of people gathered across the banks of the River Seine to watch as the lead plates forming the spire melted, causing it to buckle.\nInside the church, meanwhile, firefighters had formed a human chain that ferried artworks from the cathedral to trucks bound for city hall.\n\u201cSaving the artwork is a difficult maneuver, it\u2019s being carried out in smoke, with falling materials, notably melted lead,\u201d said Jean-Claude Gallet, the commander of the Paris firefighting brigade.\nBoth the crown of thorns and the tunic of St. Louis, a canonized French king, were among the valuables that made it out of the cathedral\u2019s treasury, French officials said.\nAt 8:05 p.m., the spire collapsed, forcing firefighters out of the building to be replaced by a remote-controlled water cannon.\nBy the time the sun rose Tuesday morning over the smoldering edifice, major questions remained.\nA handbook endorsed by France\u2019s culture ministry advises contractors to fill out a fire permit for any work on a historic building that involves an open flame.\nWorkers are also instructed to remain on-site for at least two hours after finishing work involving flames or high heat, and to keep fire extinguishers on hand in case a fire breaks out.\nRelated\nJulien Le Bras of Le Bras Fr\u00e8res, one of the contractors involved in the renovation, said none of his workers were at the site at the time the fire broke out, adding that all safety norms were followed.\nDidier Durand, chairman of stoneworks company Pierrenoel, had worked through Monday night to evacuate the treasury before returning to the cathedral Tuesday to focus on the northern transept, which remains at risk of collapse.\nPerched about 130 feet above the ground, Mr. Durand and his team delicately removed a statue at the transept\u2019s apex to prevent it from pulling down the ceiling.\n\u201cYesterday we were completely annihilated. Today we are stabilizing,\u201d he said.\nAt around 8 a.m., before the fire was entirely extinguished, Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, an official at the interior ministry, which oversees the fire brigade, convened a status meeting with architects that specialize in historical monuments to figure out the next steps.\n\u201cThe goal was to assure that the building wouldn\u2019t fail,\u201d Mr. Nu\u00f1ez later said.\nThe verdict: there were \u201ca few vulnerabilities\u201d\u2014particularly the apex of the cathedral\u2019s northern transept, which was at risk of crumbling, Mr. Nu\u00f1ez said. There the vaulted stone ceiling of the cathedral had collapsed, leaving the rest of the ceiling fragile. As a precaution, emergency workers cleared people from five buildings near the transept in case it gave way, Mr. Nu\u00f1ez said.\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\nAt the same time, another danger emerged: In dousing parts of the cathedral to contain the blaze, firefighters had soaked centuries-old stones, adding to their weight in a way that could change the balance of the building.\n\u201cNecessarily there will be some settling, and that poses a risk,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric L\u00e9toff\u00e9, president of GMH, a trade group for French companies that restore historic monuments. A large amount of water had also collected on top of the weakened ceilings along the main nave, he added.\nIt was with those dangers in mind that Jos\u00e9 Vaz de Matos, a fire-security expert for the French culture ministry, climbed up into the building\u2019s two massive belfries on a reconnaissance mission with experts from Paris city hall and the culture ministry, he said later that morning.\nThe goal was to make a quick assessment so officials could decide where to focus their resources.\n\u201cRemarkably, we were able to determine that the fundamental elements of the edifice known world-wide\u2014the belfries\u2014have been secured,\u201d Mr. Vaz de Matos later said.\nLater in the day, a restorer at the site found the copper weather vane that had topped the fallen spire and was thought lost.\nThough damaged from the heat and the fall, it was still recognizable as it was returned to the cathedral\u2019s chief architect.\n\u201cIt may still contain its relics,\u201d Mr. Durand said. \u201cTomorrow we will start rebuilding.\u201d\nShare Your Thoughts\nHow much do you value the preservation of historic structures like Notre Dame for future generations?

He also did stints as a high-level official in the Treasury Department in the Obama administration and as a chief economist at the Labor Department during the Clinton administration.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Alan was someone who was deeper than numbers on a screen and charts on a page. He saw economic policy not as a matter of abstract theories, but as a way to make people&rsquo;s lives better,&rdquo; Mr. Obama said in a statement. &ldquo;Through it all, he had a perpetual smile and a gentle spirit&mdash;even when he was correcting you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In a field often dominated by theories and models, some of Mr. Krueger&rsquo;s most recognized work involved the use of so-called natural experiments to test widely held ideas. In the most famous example, he and University of California, Berkeley economist David Card examined the impact of a state-level minimum-wage increase in New Jersey by comparing fast-food employment there to neighboring Pennsylvania, where the minimum wage stayed the same. Their finding&mdash;that the minimum-wage increase didn&rsquo;t reduce employment&mdash;challenged a long-held assumption in economics.</p>\n<p>At the center of Mr. Krueger&rsquo;s research was a desire to understand human suffering and how public policy could ameliorate it, said Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan labor economist he mentored.</p>\n<figure>  <h4> From the Archives </h4>   An error occurred. Please try again later.<figcaption> In an appearance at the 2013 WSJ CFO Network, Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Alan Krueger discussed some of the factors that have created wide levels of income inequality and suggested strengthening communities and union representation can help bridge the gap. (Originally published June 18, 2013) </figcaption></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;He was the first person who taught me that there is nothing more painful for an unemployed person to do than search for a job, and that we couldn&rsquo;t really understand job search and unemployment without acknowledging that fact,&rdquo; Ms. Stevenson said. &ldquo;He really cared about the human face of economics and what was happening to people in the labor market.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That led him in recent years to highlight a link between two ostensibly separate problems: low labor-force participation and rising addiction to opioid painkillers. In a discovery that alarmed many policy makers, Mr. Krueger found that nearly half of working-age American men outside the labor force took pain medication on a given day.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Prime-age men who are out of the labor force report that they experience notably low levels of emotional well-being throughout their days, and that they derive relatively little meaning from their daily activities,&rdquo; Mr. Krueger wrote in a 2017 paper.</p>\n<p>A development that particularly bothered him in recent years, Ms. Stevenson said, was companies&rsquo; growing use of non-compete clauses in employment contracts targeting low-wage workers. Not only do such practices impede the functioning of competitive labor markets, but they hold down wage growth and &ldquo;lead to depressed people who feel trapped,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Economists said Mr. Krueger&mdash;born Sept. 17, 1960, in Livingston, N.J.&mdash;was a prolific researcher who was at the peak of his career, adding to the sense of loss.</p>\n<p>He was the keynote speaker last summer at the Kansas City Fed&rsquo;s monetary policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., where he argued that sluggish wage growth may result from workers losing bargaining power as union representation declines and fewer employers come to dominate many labor markets.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll just be terribly missed because he was a wonderful person who showed how economics could be used to illuminate all different kinds of aspects of daily life,&rdquo; said former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who headed Princeton&rsquo;s economics department and knew Mr. Krueger well.</p>\n<p>In addition to his work, Mr. Krueger&rsquo;s friends said he will be remembered as a generous host of July 4 gatherings at his backyard pool and Super Bowl parties where Ivy League economists would watch the game on beanbag chairs in the family basement. Despite picking up tennis as an adult, he routinely won matches against colleagues and friends who had played their whole lives.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He was one of these academics who was not at all an egghead,&rdquo; said fellow Princeton economics professor Ilyana Kuziemko, noting that Mr. Krueger loved sports&mdash;particularly the New York Giants&mdash;and pop culture. &ldquo;In a discipline like economics that can be really intimidating, it&rsquo;s really nice that Alan had this variety of interests, some of them not strictly academic.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Krueger is survived by his wife, Lisa, and his two adult children, Sydney and Benjamin.</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Paul Kiernan at <a href=\"mailto:paul.kiernan@wsj.com\">paul.kiernan@wsj.com</a> and Nick Timiraos at <a href=\"mailto:nick.timiraos@wsj.com\">nick.timiraos@wsj.com</a></p>",

                "text": "Mr. Krueger, a labor economist who wrote papers on topics including rock \u2019n\u2019 roll concerts and the roots of terrorism, was tapped by Mr. Obama in 2011 to serve as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. He also did stints as a high-level official in the Treasury Department in the Obama administration and as a chief economist at the Labor Department during the Clinton administration.\n\u201cAlan was someone who was deeper than numbers on a screen and charts on a page. He saw economic policy not as a matter of abstract theories, but as a way to make people\u2019s lives better,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement. \u201cThrough it all, he had a perpetual smile and a gentle spirit\u2014even when he was correcting you.\u201d\nIn a field often dominated by theories and models, some of Mr. Krueger\u2019s most recognized work involved the use of so-called natural experiments to test widely held ideas. In the most famous example, he and University of California, Berkeley economist David Card examined the impact of a state-level minimum-wage increase in New Jersey by comparing fast-food employment there to neighboring Pennsylvania, where the minimum wage stayed the same. Their finding\u2014that the minimum-wage increase didn\u2019t reduce employment\u2014challenged a long-held assumption in economics.\nAt the center of Mr. Krueger\u2019s research was a desire to understand human suffering and how public policy could ameliorate it, said Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan labor economist he mentored.\nFrom the Archives\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\n\u201cHe was the first person who taught me that there is nothing more painful for an unemployed person to do than search for a job, and that we couldn\u2019t really understand job search and unemployment without acknowledging that fact,\u201d Ms. Stevenson said. \u201cHe really cared about the human face of economics and what was happening to people in the labor market.\u201d\nThat led him in recent years to highlight a link between two ostensibly separate problems: low labor-force participation and rising addiction to opioid painkillers. In a discovery that alarmed many policy makers, Mr. Krueger found that nearly half of working-age American men outside the labor force took pain medication on a given day.\n\u201cPrime-age men who are out of the labor force report that they experience notably low levels of emotional well-being throughout their days, and that they derive relatively little meaning from their daily activities,\u201d Mr. Krueger wrote in a 2017 paper.\nA development that particularly bothered him in recent years, Ms. Stevenson said, was companies\u2019 growing use of non-compete clauses in employment contracts targeting low-wage workers. Not only do such practices impede the functioning of competitive labor markets, but they hold down wage growth and \u201clead to depressed people who feel trapped,\u201d she said.\nEconomists said Mr. Krueger\u2014born Sept. 17, 1960, in Livingston, N.J.\u2014was a prolific researcher who was at the peak of his career, adding to the sense of loss.\nHe was the keynote speaker last summer at the Kansas City Fed\u2019s monetary policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., where he argued that sluggish wage growth may result from workers losing bargaining power as union representation declines and fewer employers come to dominate many labor markets.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll just be terribly missed because he was a wonderful person who showed how economics could be used to illuminate all different kinds of aspects of daily life,\u201d said former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who headed Princeton\u2019s economics department and knew Mr. Krueger well.\nIn addition to his work, Mr. Krueger\u2019s friends said he will be remembered as a generous host of July 4 gatherings at his backyard pool and Super Bowl parties where Ivy League economists would watch the game on beanbag chairs in the family basement. Despite picking up tennis as an adult, he routinely won matches against colleagues and friends who had played their whole lives.\n\u201cHe was one of these academics who was not at all an egghead,\u201d said fellow Princeton economics professor Ilyana Kuziemko, noting that Mr. Krueger loved sports\u2014particularly the New York Giants\u2014and pop culture. \u201cIn a discipline like economics that can be really intimidating, it\u2019s really nice that Alan had this variety of interests, some of them not strictly academic.\u201d\nMr. Krueger is survived by his wife, Lisa, and his two adult children, Sydney and Benjamin.\nWrite to Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com and Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com",

Photo: Getty </figcaption></figure>\n<h4>Related Coverage</h4>\n<p>Prior to Tuesday&rsquo;s Transportation Department announcement, The Wall Street Journal reported the inspector general alerted some FAA offices to safeguard computer files related to the plane&rsquo;s certification. On Tuesday, people familiar with the details said the earlier inquiry is proceeding in coordination with an investigation led by the Justice Department&rsquo;s criminal division.</p>\n<p>The Journal also reported earlier Tuesday that the White House was expected to pick Mr. Dickson, and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-delta-air-lines-executive-and-pilot-is-top-pick-to-head-faa-1541175751?mod=article_inline\">reported last year</a> that he was the leading candidate for the job.</p>\n<p>The move could be followed by other personnel shifts inside the FAA, said people familiar with the matter, amounting to a broader agency revamp <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeings-design-for-its-737-max-jet-draws-scrutiny-11552952750?mod=article_inline\">after negative fallout</a> from the two 737 MAX crashes. That fallout includes various investigations, attacks from lawmakers and implicit criticism from foreign regulators.</p>\n<p>Air-safety regulators in Canada and Europe have said they plan to take the unusual step of reviewing the FAA&rsquo;s initial safety approval of the airplane model. They have also said they intend to review the U.S. aviation agency&rsquo;s impending approval of a coming software fix for a flight-control system implicated in the first of the crashes.</p>\n<p>The announcement, according to industry officials, former government policy makers and others familiar with the matter, initially was slated for earlier this month and then postponed because of the controversy swirling around the second fatal 737 MAX crash, on March 10 in Ethiopia.</p>\n<p>The nomination is subject to Senate confirmation.</p>\n<p>Mr. Dickson left Delta in 2018 after a 27-year career in which he flew five different aircraft types and ended up in charge of training, technical support and regulatory compliance for the carrier&rsquo;s more than 13,000 pilots.</p>\n<p>He has broad industry support and has been viewed as a consensus candidate, after jostling between the White House and some aviation leaders over who should get the job.</p>\n<p>President Trump&rsquo;s initial preference for John Dunkin, a former airline pilot who later worked as Mr. Trump&rsquo;s corporate pilot, faced resistance from industry and some administration officials.</p>\n<p>Those disagreements delayed the final decision for months, people familiar with the deliberations said. In public statements and private discussions, these people said, Mr. Trump insisted he wanted a pilot to fill the post.</p>\n<p>The next FAA chief will face daunting challenges, starting with trying to shore up trust in the agency among its overseas counterparts.</p>\n<p>Dozens of foreign regulators, including close air-safety partners such as Canada and Australia, unilaterally grounded the 737 MAX after the crash earlier this month of the Ethiopian Airlines jetliner, even as the FAA maintained its confidence in the model. Traditionally, countries accept safety signoffs by the nation in which a specific aircraft type is approved and manufactured&mdash;without double-checking those decisions.</p>\n<p>Regarding efforts to approve a software fix for the suspect stall-prevention system on the 737 MAX, Patrick Ky, head of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, said earlier Tuesday: &ldquo;We hope to be able to do it in perfect coordination with our FAA colleagues, but we intend to really do our work to the extent that we think is necessary to make sure we have a safe aircraft.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Boeing&rsquo;s crisis with the plane also has created domestic problems for the FAA. The Justice Department&rsquo;s criminal division and the Transportation Department&rsquo;s inspector general are scrutinizing how the FAA approved the design and established training requirements for the latest version of the decades-old aircraft type.</p>\n<p>On Capitol Hill, Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio or Oregon, a longtime FAA critic and chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has signaled he intends to launch a broad investigation of FAA actions regarding the aircraft. In addition to delving into details of the pending fix, Mr. DeFazio said in an interview last week that the probe will examine the safety standards used to certify the overall aircraft.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a real question why the FAA didn&rsquo;t determine that this was essentially a totally different airplane&rdquo; from previous versions of the 737, Mr. DeFazio said. Such a conclusion would have entailed more rigorous technical review of certain Boeing design and engineering decisions.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Mr. Dickson earned the enmity of some labor groups because while at Delta, he unsuccessfully advocated an FAA interpretation of flight-time regulations that in some instances, would have required pilots to fly and stay on duty substantially longer than currently permitted.</p>\n<p>He also was the public face of Delta when it broke ranks with other major U.S. carriers by publicly and forcefully opposing proposals to privatize the nation&rsquo;s air-traffic control system. Those plans were initially supported by the Trump administration, but they never made it through Congress and have faded as a White House priority.</p>\n<p>Another contentious issue waiting for Mr. Dickson stems from the FAA&rsquo;s longstanding reliance on using thousands of designated industry employees&ndash;rather than agency officials&mdash;to sign off on some safety-related regulatory matters. Such practices are likely to be examined by lawmakers with regard to 737 MAX certification</p>\n<p>The new administrator also must wrestle with the challenge of establishing new rules and expanding oversight and enforcement activities to cover fast-growing commercial operations of unmanned aircraft. But at the same time, the agency must operate in a deregulatory environment with White House officials generally skeptical&mdash;and often directly critical&mdash;of costs associated with additional federal regulations.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Siobhan Hughes, Alex Leary and Robert Wall contributed to this article.</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Andy Pasztor at <a href=\"mailto:andy.pasztor@wsj.com\">andy.pasztor@wsj.com</a> and Andrew Tangel at <a href=\"mailto:Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com\">Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com</a></p>\n<p>Appeared in the March 20, 2019, print edition as 'Former Delta Official to Be Nominated to Lead FAA.'</p>",

                "text": "Since January 2018 the FAA has been run by acting chief Daniel Elwell, a longtime aviation expert who moved up from deputy administrator and is widely viewed as a close ally of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. The FAA is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nIn addition to continuing scrutiny of the FAA\u2019s decision-making by the Transportation Department\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office, Secretary Chao on Tuesday also asked the same office to conduct an audit compiling \u201can objective and detailed factual history of the activities that resulted in the certification of the Boeing 737-MAX.\u201d The latest effort, she said in a written statement, is intended to \u201cassist the FAA in ensuring that its safety procedures are implemented effectively.\u201d\nU.S. Grounds Boeing 737 MAX Fleet\nYou may also like\nUp Next\nCreated with sketchtool.\n0:00 / 1:43\nU.S. Grounds Boeing 737 MAX Fleet\nRelated Coverage\nPrior to Tuesday\u2019s Transportation Department announcement, The Wall Street Journal reported the inspector general alerted some FAA offices to safeguard computer files related to the plane\u2019s certification. On Tuesday, people familiar with the details said the earlier inquiry is proceeding in coordination with an investigation led by the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division.\nThe Journal also reported earlier Tuesday that the White House was expected to pick Mr. Dickson, and reported last year that he was the leading candidate for the job.\nThe move could be followed by other personnel shifts inside the FAA, said people familiar with the matter, amounting to a broader agency revamp after negative fallout from the two 737 MAX crashes. That fallout includes various investigations, attacks from lawmakers and implicit criticism from foreign regulators.\nAir-safety regulators in Canada and Europe have said they plan to take the unusual step of reviewing the FAA\u2019s initial safety approval of the airplane model. They have also said they intend to review the U.S. aviation agency\u2019s impending approval of a coming software fix for a flight-control system implicated in the first of the crashes.\nThe announcement, according to industry officials, former government policy makers and others familiar with the matter, initially was slated for earlier this month and then postponed because of the controversy swirling around the second fatal 737 MAX crash, on March 10 in Ethiopia.\nThe nomination is subject to Senate confirmation.\nMr. Dickson left Delta in 2018 after a 27-year career in which he flew five different aircraft types and ended up in charge of training, technical support and regulatory compliance for the carrier\u2019s more than 13,000 pilots.\nHe has broad industry support and has been viewed as a consensus candidate, after jostling between the White House and some aviation leaders over who should get the job.\nPresident Trump\u2019s initial preference for John Dunkin, a former airline pilot who later worked as Mr. Trump\u2019s corporate pilot, faced resistance from industry and some administration officials.\nThose disagreements delayed the final decision for months, people familiar with the deliberations said. In public statements and private discussions, these people said, Mr. Trump insisted he wanted a pilot to fill the post.\nThe next FAA chief will face daunting challenges, starting with trying to shore up trust in the agency among its overseas counterparts.\nDozens of foreign regulators, including close air-safety partners such as Canada and Australia, unilaterally grounded the 737 MAX after the crash earlier this month of the Ethiopian Airlines jetliner, even as the FAA maintained its confidence in the model. Traditionally, countries accept safety signoffs by the nation in which a specific aircraft type is approved and manufactured\u2014without double-checking those decisions.\nRegarding efforts to approve a software fix for the suspect stall-prevention system on the 737 MAX, Patrick Ky, head of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, said earlier Tuesday: \u201cWe hope to be able to do it in perfect coordination with our FAA colleagues, but we intend to really do our work to the extent that we think is necessary to make sure we have a safe aircraft.\u201d\nBoeing\u2019s crisis with the plane also has created domestic problems for the FAA. The Justice Department\u2019s criminal division and the Transportation Department\u2019s inspector general are scrutinizing how the FAA approved the design and established training requirements for the latest version of the decades-old aircraft type.\nOn Capitol Hill, Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio or Oregon, a longtime FAA critic and chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has signaled he intends to launch a broad investigation of FAA actions regarding the aircraft. In addition to delving into details of the pending fix, Mr. DeFazio said in an interview last week that the probe will examine the safety standards used to certify the overall aircraft.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real question why the FAA didn\u2019t determine that this was essentially a totally different airplane\u201d from previous versions of the 737, Mr. DeFazio said. Such a conclusion would have entailed more rigorous technical review of certain Boeing design and engineering decisions.\nOver the years, Mr. Dickson earned the enmity of some labor groups because while at Delta, he unsuccessfully advocated an FAA interpretation of flight-time regulations that in some instances, would have required pilots to fly and stay on duty substantially longer than currently permitted.\nHe also was the public face of Delta when it broke ranks with other major U.S. carriers by publicly and forcefully opposing proposals to privatize the nation\u2019s air-traffic control system. Those plans were initially supported by the Trump administration, but they never made it through Congress and have faded as a White House priority.\nAnother contentious issue waiting for Mr. Dickson stems from the FAA\u2019s longstanding reliance on using thousands of designated industry employees\u2013rather than agency officials\u2014to sign off on some safety-related regulatory matters. Such practices are likely to be examined by lawmakers with regard to 737 MAX certification\nThe new administrator also must wrestle with the challenge of establishing new rules and expanding oversight and enforcement activities to cover fast-growing commercial operations of unmanned aircraft. But at the same time, the agency must operate in a deregulatory environment with White House officials generally skeptical\u2014and often directly critical\u2014of costs associated with additional federal regulations.\n\u2014Siobhan Hughes, Alex Leary and Robert Wall contributed to this article.\nWrite to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com and Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com\nAppeared in the March 20, 2019, print edition as 'Former Delta Official to Be Nominated to Lead FAA.'",

A condo association in Orlando, Fla., in 2017 waged an unsuccessful 18-month battle with a disabled veteran whose emotional support dog was 6 pounds above a 35-pound limit. It took a four-year legal battle for an HOA in suburban Charlotte, N.C., to get a homeowner to remove an unapproved pool house and Tiki hut.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Every now and then, someone comes along in the HOA membership who wants to buck the system,&rdquo; said Larry Szabo, president of HOA Member Services LLC, a Los Angeles-based resource guide for associations.</p>\n<p>Mr. Hildenbrand, 66, said he wasn&rsquo;t looking for trouble when he moved back from Iowa to his boyhood home of Kansas City in 2012. He liked the look and location of Avignon Villa, where the HOA handled tasks like lawn maintenance for the mostly retired residents of its 153 well-tended homes. Mr. Hildenbrand was given a list of the HOA rules at the closing and initialed it, but said he didn&rsquo;t realize what it was.</p>\n<p>While still unpacking in his three-bedroom home, Mr. Hildenbrand said he got a phone call from an HOA manager that he was in violation of several rules: leaving his vehicles parked in the driveway overnight, instead of inside the garage, and improperly putting a St. Francis statue out front and ceramic flower pots on the driveway. He argued that the decorations were temporarily in the wrong place as part of his move and the garage was full of his belongings waiting to go inside.</p>\n<p>When he installed a satellite dish next to his home in the backyard, the HOA advised him it had to be in the middle of the yard, he said. Mr. Hildenbrand refused to move it, arguing the placement of the dishes falls under federal control. An attorney for the developer issued a warning the HOA would sue to make him comply.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-60663?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-60663?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-60663?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60663?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60663?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60663?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60663?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60663?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>The HOA wanted Mr. Hildenbrand&rsquo;s satellite dish in the middle of his yard.</h4>   Photo:  Jim Hildenbrand  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;Your noncompliance with the Covenants leaves negative impressions with prospective purchasers,&rdquo; lawyer Michael White wrote in a July 10, 2012, letter.</p>\n<p>Mr. Hildenbrand responded by hiring an attorney of his own.</p>\n<p>The board dropped the demand after it was advised by the Federal Communications Commission that the HOA had no jurisdiction over satellite dishes.</p>\n<p>By December, a new HOA board decided to waive fines of about $3,500 for Mr. Hildenbrand&rsquo;s violations, said Don Blehm, its president then. &ldquo;We wanted to start off on a clean slate,&rdquo; said Mr. Blehm, 73, a retired telecommunications manager.</p>\n<p>The fight instead just got more vicious.</p>\n<p>Some months later, Mr. Blehm was notified by a neighbor that Mr. Hildenbrand had begun construction of a low, roughly 70-foot-long, faux stone wall wrapping around an area planted with flowers and shrubs on one side of his house. The HOA ordered Mr. Hildenbrand to take it down. Mr. Hildenbrand retained a second attorney to file suit in state district court in Olathe. The HOA filed a counterclaim.</p>\n<p>After a one-day trial, Judge Gerald Elliott in January 2014 ruled Mr. Hildenbrand had not shown evidence his wall project was approved and ordered him to seek approval through an HOA-managed committee&mdash;which declined it. Courts have generally supported the idea that HOA rules are enforceable contracts as long as they are applied fairly and don&rsquo;t abridge civil rights.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;Are you kidding me?&rsquo; &rdquo; Mr. Hildenbrand said. &ldquo;The stupidity of this whole thing amazed me.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-60676?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-60676?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-60676?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60676?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60676?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60676?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60676?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-60676?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Mr. Hildenbrand&rsquo;s home. </h4>   Photo:  Jim Hildenbrand  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Mr. Hildenbrand, who like his neighbors pays monthly fees of $185 to the HOA, retained a third attorney, who filed motions alleging the association and its committee had acted in &ldquo;bad faith,&rdquo; because they hadn&rsquo;t treated Mr. Hildenbrand the same as other homeowners.</p>\n<p>The judge denied the motions, and Mr. Hildenbrand appealed to the Kansas Court of Appeals, which in 2016 sent the case back to the lower court for a new hearing on the issue of what constituted good faith.</p>\n<p>The case dragged into 2017 as Mr. Hildenbrand&rsquo;s lawyer, Eldon J. Shields, asked the HOA to document every landscaping project at Avignon Villa since the subdivision opened in 2006. In reviewing the more than 4,000 pages of documents, Mr. Shields said he discovered dozens of other landscaping walls in the subdivision with approval. An attorney for the HOA, Lawrence L. Ferree III, said many weren&rsquo;t comparable because they were minor projects that consisted of &ldquo;limestone rocks lying in a mulch bed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A new judge, Rhonda Mason, ruled last year that Mr. Hildenbrand had been dealt with unfairly but also failed to obtain approval for the wall and ordered him to pay a $25,000 fine to the HOA. The HOA appealed, and Mr. Hildenbrand said he plans to as well.</p>\n<p>As of October, HOA records show it has spent a total of $388,000 on the case with $35,000 more budgeted for 2019, while people familiar with the matter said Mr. Hildenbrand has spent about $400,000. That&rsquo;s close to the market value of his home.</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Jim Carlton at <a href=\"mailto:jim.carlton@wsj.com\">jim.carlton@wsj.com</a></p>",

                "text": "Things went downhill from there.\nAfter he installed a decorative, shin-high wall around a plant bed on the side of his house, saying it would enhance the curb appeal, the HOA ordered him to remove it because it hadn\u2019t been approved by an architectural review committee. Mr. Hildenbrand said he actually had the needed approval.\nSeven years after he moved in, the HOA and Mr. Hildenbrand are still fighting over the decorative wall in court, with no end in sight. The dispute has consumed nearly $1 million in legal fees\u2014the most expensive active HOA case of this type in the country, according to experts keeping track of such things.\n\u201cAm I throwing away a lot of good money?\u201d Mr. Hildenbrand, a retired owner of an architectural consulting business, asked rhetorically. \u201cI have to do the right thing, and this is the right thing.\u201d\nHOAs collect monthly fees from residents to help take care of maintenance and other upkeep. Their approach to enforcing community rules\u2014especially on seemingly petty matters\u2014can spur philosophical standoffs that the principals see as a battle of order versus chaos, freedom versus oppression.\nMr. Hildenbrand said he did not receive anything in writing saying he couldn\u2019t build a decorative wall, and that he decided to go to the mat to protect his right to do it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s standing up for my constitutional rights,\u201d he said. He called the HOA board \u201ca dictatorship\u201d that polices residents for any infraction of its 50 pages of covenants, conditions and restrictions.\nBoard members and some residents said they are the victim of a rogue neighbor: \u201cWe\u2019d just like for this to go away,\u201d said Bob Collins, 77, a retired machinery executive. \u201cThe guy just didn\u2019t comply with the rules like the rest of us have.\u201d\nNiels Mortensen, the current HOA president, said the association has to enforce its rules. \u201cThe minute you start saying, \u2018Oh well, that\u2019s not a big deal,\u2019 then before you know it, nothing is a big deal,\u201d Mr. Mortensen said. \u201cI view this as a test case: Either our declarations are enforceable, or they\u2019re not.\u201d\nAnother contingent of residents supports Mr. Hildenbrand, asserting they have been mistreated by the HOA board. \u201cThey have bullied for so long so many of the residents,\u201d said Connie Morris, 66, whose complaints include the association not allowing a decorative bench in her front yard.\nBitter disputes with HOAs abound. A condo association in Orlando, Fla., in 2017 waged an unsuccessful 18-month battle with a disabled veteran whose emotional support dog was 6 pounds above a 35-pound limit. It took a four-year legal battle for an HOA in suburban Charlotte, N.C., to get a homeowner to remove an unapproved pool house and Tiki hut.\n\u201cEvery now and then, someone comes along in the HOA membership who wants to buck the system,\u201d said Larry Szabo, president of HOA Member Services LLC, a Los Angeles-based resource guide for associations.\nMr. Hildenbrand, 66, said he wasn\u2019t looking for trouble when he moved back from Iowa to his boyhood home of Kansas City in 2012. He liked the look and location of Avignon Villa, where the HOA handled tasks like lawn maintenance for the mostly retired residents of its 153 well-tended homes. Mr. Hildenbrand was given a list of the HOA rules at the closing and initialed it, but said he didn\u2019t realize what it was.\nWhile still unpacking in his three-bedroom home, Mr. Hildenbrand said he got a phone call from an HOA manager that he was in violation of several rules: leaving his vehicles parked in the driveway overnight, instead of inside the garage, and improperly putting a St. Francis statue out front and ceramic flower pots on the driveway. He argued that the decorations were temporarily in the wrong place as part of his move and the garage was full of his belongings waiting to go inside.\nWhen he installed a satellite dish next to his home in the backyard, the HOA advised him it had to be in the middle of the yard, he said. Mr. Hildenbrand refused to move it, arguing the placement of the dishes falls under federal control. An attorney for the developer issued a warning the HOA would sue to make him comply.\n\u201cYour noncompliance with the Covenants leaves negative impressions with prospective purchasers,\u201d lawyer Michael White wrote in a July 10, 2012, letter.\nMr. Hildenbrand responded by hiring an attorney of his own.\nThe board dropped the demand after it was advised by the Federal Communications Commission that the HOA had no jurisdiction over satellite dishes.\nBy December, a new HOA board decided to waive fines of about $3,500 for Mr. Hildenbrand\u2019s violations, said Don Blehm, its president then. \u201cWe wanted to start off on a clean slate,\u201d said Mr. Blehm, 73, a retired telecommunications manager.\nThe fight instead just got more vicious.\nSome months later, Mr. Blehm was notified by a neighbor that Mr. Hildenbrand had begun construction of a low, roughly 70-foot-long, faux stone wall wrapping around an area planted with flowers and shrubs on one side of his house. The HOA ordered Mr. Hildenbrand to take it down. Mr. Hildenbrand retained a second attorney to file suit in state district court in Olathe. The HOA filed a counterclaim.\nAfter a one-day trial, Judge Gerald Elliott in January 2014 ruled Mr. Hildenbrand had not shown evidence his wall project was approved and ordered him to seek approval through an HOA-managed committee\u2014which declined it. Courts have generally supported the idea that HOA rules are enforceable contracts as long as they are applied fairly and don\u2019t abridge civil rights.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Hildenbrand said. \u201cThe stupidity of this whole thing amazed me.\u201d\nMr. Hildenbrand, who like his neighbors pays monthly fees of $185 to the HOA, retained a third attorney, who filed motions alleging the association and its committee had acted in \u201cbad faith,\u201d because they hadn\u2019t treated Mr. Hildenbrand the same as other homeowners.\nThe judge denied the motions, and Mr. Hildenbrand appealed to the Kansas Court of Appeals, which in 2016 sent the case back to the lower court for a new hearing on the issue of what constituted good faith.\nThe case dragged into 2017 as Mr. Hildenbrand\u2019s lawyer, Eldon J. Shields, asked the HOA to document every landscaping project at Avignon Villa since the subdivision opened in 2006. In reviewing the more than 4,000 pages of documents, Mr. Shields said he discovered dozens of other landscaping walls in the subdivision with approval. An attorney for the HOA, Lawrence L. Ferree III, said many weren\u2019t comparable because they were minor projects that consisted of \u201climestone rocks lying in a mulch bed.\u201d\nA new judge, Rhonda Mason, ruled last year that Mr. Hildenbrand had been dealt with unfairly but also failed to obtain approval for the wall and ordered him to pay a $25,000 fine to the HOA. The HOA appealed, and Mr. Hildenbrand said he plans to as well.\nAs of October, HOA records show it has spent a total of $388,000 on the case with $35,000 more budgeted for 2019, while people familiar with the matter said Mr. Hildenbrand has spent about $400,000. That\u2019s close to the market value of his home.\nWrite to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com",
