This was no high-speed rail.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, after a reported 60-hour, or two-and-half day trip, the 35-year-old leader of the world&rsquo;s most secretive hermit kingdom alighted at the railway station in Dong Dang, Vietnam. Kim was then picked up by a limo, and <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/a3cd1c3b7c2d46bf8fdc235cdbd51c15\">driven</a> the rest of the way to Hanoi, according to the Associated Press.</p>\n<p>This seeming anachronistic mode of travel has long been favored by the Supreme Leaders, Kim, his father and his grandfather. The distinctive green and yellow train adds to the shroud of mystery cloaking North Korea, and is part of the Kim dynasty&rsquo;s lore.</p>\n<p>Here are the possible reasons behind Kim&rsquo;s unusual form of transit.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (C) arrives at the Dong Dang railway station in Dong Dang, Lang Son province, on February 26, 2019, to attend the second US-North Korea summit.\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kim-jong-un-vietnam-train.jpg?w=800&quality=85\"></img><figcaption>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (C) arrives at the Dong Dang railway station in Dong Dang, Lang Son province, on February 26, 2019, to attend the second US-North Korea summit.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (C) arrives at the Dong Dang railway station in Dong Dang, Lang Son province, on February 26, 2019, to attend the second US-North Korea summit.</p>\n<p>NHAC NGUYEN&mdash;AFP/Getty Images</p>\n<h3>Riding a train is the family tradition</h3>\n<p>Kim&rsquo;s father, Kim Jong Il, and his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, were both allegedly afraid of flying. South Korean media has <a href=\"http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2015/04/14/2015041401757.html\">speculated</a> that the fear was triggered when the two witnessed the explosion of their jet during a test flight. The incident happened in 1982. While Kim Il Sung flew to the Soviet Union after, in 1986, it was the last time a North Korean leader publicly traveled abroad by air for more than three decades, according to AP.</p>\n<h2>Related Stories</h2>\n<p> <a href=\"https://time.com/5778066/north-korea-nuclear-submarine/\">   <figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/North-korean-submarine-launch.jpg?w=600&h=93&quality=85\"></img></figure>   </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/world/\">  World  </a></p>\n<h3> <a href=\"https://time.com/5778066/north-korea-nuclear-submarine/\"> How a North Korean Nuclear-Armed Submarine Could Make It Even Harder to Strike a Deal </a> </h3>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://time.com/5772279/kim-jong-un-aunt-photo-uncle-executed/\">   <figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/kim-jong-un-aunt-photo.jpg?w=600&h=93&quality=85\"></img></figure>   </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/world/\">  World  </a></p>\n<h3> <a href=\"https://time.com/5772279/kim-jong-un-aunt-photo-uncle-executed/\"> Kim Jong Un's Aunt Reemerges in North Korea, After Years of Speculation Surrounding Her Fate </a> </h3>\n<p>By contrast, Kim Jong Un is believed to have become a frequent flier during his boarding school days in Switzerland. Since taking office in 2011, he has also occasionally opted to fly, including to Singapore last year for his first tete-a-tete with Trump. But his preference for rails this trip could be an ode to his family line and a way to keep up the train travel tradition among North Korean leaders.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A train transporting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrives at the Dong Dang railway station in Dong Dang, Lang Son province, on February 26, 2019.\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kim-jong-un-train.jpg?w=800&quality=85\"></img><figcaption>A train transporting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrives at the Dong Dang railway station in Dong Dang, Lang Son province, on February 26, 2019.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A train transporting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrives at the Dong Dang railway station in Dong Dang, Lang Son province, on February 26, 2019.</p>\n<p>NHAC NGUYEN&mdash;AFP/Getty Images</p>\n<h3>Kim&rsquo;s armored train provides more security&mdash;and luxury&mdash;than a flight</h3>\n<p>Kim&rsquo;s train, the same one used by his father and grandfather, has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-train/kims-peace-train-offers-luxury-en-route-to-summit-with-trump-idUSKCN1QD06K\">21 bulletproof carriages</a> with plush leather sofas and conference rooms, according to Reuters.</p>\n<p>Chosun Media states that <a href=\"http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/11/09/2009110900406.html\">two separate trains</a> travel with the main entourage; the one in front handles security checks to ensure the railway tracks are safe, and the one behind carries bodyguards and support personnel.</p>\n<h3><strong>North Korea lacks the air infrastructure that would make a flight possible</strong></h3>\n<p>Kim&rsquo;s decision to take the 60-hour journey may have also been a matter of pride. To get to Singapore for the <a href=\"https://time.com/5309062/donald-trump-kim-jong-jong-un-handshake-singapore/\">Trump summit last June</a>, Kim borrowed a Boeing 747 Air China plane because his Soviet-made Ilyushin Il-62 aircraft was deemed unsafe, suggesting that without external help, a flight to Vietnam would not be possible. By opting for the train instead, Kim could show that he is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/air-force-un-as-north-koreas-leader-steps-onto-international-stage-a-question-over-his-ability-to-fly/2018/04/09/08c265e2-3c08-11e8-8d53-eba0ed2371cc_story.html?utm_term=.5ced8d2b60ab\">not reliant</a> on Beijing, analysts have suggested.</p>\n<p>Kim is expected to commence his nuclear summit with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Most Popular on TIME</p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5778994/coronavirus-china-country-future/\"> Coronavirus Tests China  </a></p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5779726/republican-governor-phil-scott-trump-abuse-power/\"> Republican Governor Says Trump Shouldn't Be in Office </a></p>\n<p>3</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5779538/trump-national-prayer-breakfast-politics/\"> 'Deeply Problematic.'

This was no high-speed rail.\nOn Tuesday, after a reported 60-hour, or two-and-half day trip, the 35-year-old leader of the world\u2019s most secretive hermit kingdom alighted at the railway station in Dong Dang, Vietnam. Kim was then picked up by a limo, and driven the rest of the way to Hanoi, according to the Associated Press.\nThis seeming anachronistic mode of travel has long been favored by the Supreme Leaders, Kim, his father and his grandfather. The distinctive green and yellow train adds to the shroud of mystery cloaking North Korea, and is part of the Kim dynasty\u2019s lore.\nHere are the possible reasons behind Kim\u2019s unusual form of transit.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un (C) arrives at the Dong Dang railway station in Dong Dang, Lang Son province, on February 26, 2019, to attend the second US-North Korea summit.\nNHAC NGUYEN\u2014AFP/Getty Images\nRiding a train is the family tradition\nKim\u2019s father, Kim Jong Il, and his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, were both allegedly afraid of flying. South Korean media has speculated that the fear was triggered when the two witnessed the explosion of their jet during a test flight. The incident happened in 1982. While Kim Il Sung flew to the Soviet Union after, in 1986, it was the last time a North Korean leader publicly traveled abroad by air for more than three decades, according to AP.\nRelated Stories\nWorld\nHow a North Korean Nuclear-Armed Submarine Could Make It Even Harder to Strike a Deal\nWorld\nKim Jong Un's Aunt Reemerges in North Korea, After Years of Speculation Surrounding Her Fate\nBy contrast, Kim Jong Un is believed to have become a frequent flier during his boarding school days in Switzerland. Since taking office in 2011, he has also occasionally opted to fly, including to Singapore last year for his first tete-a-tete with Trump. But his preference for rails this trip could be an ode to his family line and a way to keep up the train travel tradition among North Korean leaders.\nA train transporting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrives at the Dong Dang railway station in Dong Dang, Lang Son province, on February 26, 2019.\nNHAC NGUYEN\u2014AFP/Getty Images\nKim\u2019s armored train provides more security\u2014and luxury\u2014than a flight\nKim\u2019s train, the same one used by his father and grandfather, has 21 bulletproof carriages with plush leather sofas and conference rooms, according to Reuters.\nChosun Media states that two separate trains travel with the main entourage; the one in front handles security checks to ensure the railway tracks are safe, and the one behind carries bodyguards and support personnel.\nNorth Korea lacks the air infrastructure that would make a flight possible\nKim\u2019s decision to take the 60-hour journey may have also been a matter of pride. To get to Singapore for the Trump summit last June, Kim borrowed a Boeing 747 Air China plane because his Soviet-made Ilyushin Il-62 aircraft was deemed unsafe, suggesting that without external help, a flight to Vietnam would not be possible. By opting for the train instead, Kim could show that he is not reliant on Beijing, analysts have suggested.\nKim is expected to commence his nuclear summit with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday.\nMost Popular on TIME\n1\nCoronavirus Tests China\n2\nRepublican Governor Says Trump Shouldn't Be in Office\n3\n'Deeply Problematic.'

For Trump, the stakes are high and the bar is low &mdash; the failure of their meeting in Singapore last June to produce meaningful security outcomes has left him in need of a compromise.

Trump said prior to departing from Washington that he&rsquo;d settle for a moratorium on testing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in a rush, I don&rsquo;t want to rush anybody, I just don&rsquo;t want testing,&rdquo; the President said Sunday night. &ldquo;As long as there&rsquo;s no testing, we&rsquo;re happy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://time.com/5537782/north-korea-summit-trump-kim/\"><em>How the U.S. Could Lose a Trump-Kim Summit</em></a></p>\n<p>Kim could extract a lot from Trump given that low bar. His aims are likely twofold, experts say: a declaration of peace and some form of sanctions relief, possibly by creating exceptions that would allow more inter-Korean economic cooperation. The former would be largely symbolic; it would be the first time the U.S. has acknowledged its willingness to bring a formal close to the Korean War, which began in 1950 and ended in armistice three years later.</p>\n<p>A declaration would not end the war &mdash; only a treaty agreed by North and South Korea, the U.S. and China could achieve that &mdash; but it would legitimize Pyongyang&rsquo;s case that America&rsquo;s alliances in Asia are obsolete. &ldquo;A declaration of peace is a confidence building measure. Nothing more,&rdquo; says Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea now at the University of Denver. &ldquo;The concern is that it could be used by the North Koreans to argue that the U.S. no longer needs troops in South Korea.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What might worry America&rsquo;s allies is the possibility that the two leaders are in harmony on this particular issue. Some 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in the South, while about 50,000 more are in Japan. The security establishment considers this posturing critical to maintaining peace in Northeast Asia and ultimately countering Chinese dominance.</p>\n<h3>Get our Politics Newsletter.

In May of last year, he became the first President in more than three decades to suggest a retreat, when he reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/world/asia/trump-troops-south-korea.html\">ordered the Pentagon</a> to explore options for withdrawal. The last time that was so much as considered was under President Jimmy Carter &mdash; when North Korea had neither nuclear weapons nor long-range missiles.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was a bad idea then, it&rsquo;s a worse one today,&rdquo; says Daniel Russel, who served as assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs under the Obama administration and is now at the Asia Society. &ldquo;Preventing the next war,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;should be a higher priority than resolving the legal technicalities of the last one.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Experts say the <em>de facto</em> peace &mdash; meaning no hot war &mdash; that has held under armistice for more than six decades is better than a premature peace deal. According to Sung-Yoon Lee, professor of Korean Studies at the Fletcher School of Tufts University, ending the war could increase the risk of conflict. A treaty would dissolve the U.S.-led U.N. Command established to keep the peace, and American allies South Korea and Japan risk being abandoned in the crosshairs of an unhinged neighbor.</p>\n<p>But would that matter if a peace deal was achieved? &ldquo;North Korea has flagrantly violated both the letter and spirit of every single international agreement it has signed,&rdquo; Lee says. This would be no different.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://time.com/5537298/north-korea-summit-nuclear-program/\"><em>Here&rsquo;s What We Know About North Korea&rsquo;s Nuclear Program</em></a></p>\n<p>For Kim&rsquo;s part, he is expected to offer Trump something that at least resembles a willingness to reduce his country&rsquo;s arms. But his concessions are likely to fall well short of what the U.S. wants: a full inventory of nuclear assets and weapons of mass destruction; access for international inspectors; the destruction of key facilities; and a moratorium on testing. Kim could offer to decommission the North&rsquo;s enrichment facilities, but he may already have plenty of material to keep production humming.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5778994/coronavirus-china-country-future/\">    <figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/TIM200217v1_China.Cover_.jpg?w=321&h=387&quality=85\"></img></figure>     Spotlight Story The Coronavirus Outbreak Could Derail Xi Jinping&rsquo;s Dreams of a Chinese Century The virus looms over the President's national rejuvenation project and his rigid, top-down rule is being tested  </a></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Pyongyang&rsquo;s behavior shows no willingness to verifiably dismantle its nuclear program, and Kim is likely sincere when he says that his nuclear arsenal is the nation&rsquo;s &lsquo;treasured sword&rsquo; that no power can remove,&rdquo; says Russel, of the Asia Society.

A few meters away, banners hung across the medians of misty avenues reading: \u201cHanoi, the city for peace.\u201d\nThis week, the Vietnamese capital gets the chance to live up to that nickname as U.S. President Donald Trump touched down Tuesday for his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, where the pair will attempt to revive denuclearization talks.\nTrump and Kim are expected to meet twice, and both are determined to walk away with a win. For Trump, the stakes are high and the bar is low \u2014 the failure of their meeting in Singapore last June to produce meaningful security outcomes has left him in need of a compromise. So long as Kim doesn\u2019t provoke his counterpart, the two should be on course for a closing handshake.\nRelated Stories\nU.S.\nAmerican Death in Egyptian Prison\nIdeas\nCultural Heritage Reminds Us of Our Shared Humanity. That's Why Threats Against Them Are So Dangerous\nAmerica\u2019s stated goal has long been the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula \u2014 which experts agree is not on the horizon. Trump said prior to departing from Washington that he\u2019d settle for a moratorium on testing ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. \u201cI\u2019m not in a rush, I don\u2019t want to rush anybody, I just don\u2019t want testing,\u201d the President said Sunday night. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s no testing, we\u2019re happy.\u201d\nRead more: How the U.S. Could Lose a Trump-Kim Summit\nKim could extract a lot from Trump given that low bar. His aims are likely twofold, experts say: a declaration of peace and some form of sanctions relief, possibly by creating exceptions that would allow more inter-Korean economic cooperation. The former would be largely symbolic; it would be the first time the U.S. has acknowledged its willingness to bring a formal close to the Korean War, which began in 1950 and ended in armistice three years later.\nA declaration would not end the war \u2014 only a treaty agreed by North and South Korea, the U.S. and China could achieve that \u2014 but it would legitimize Pyongyang\u2019s case that America\u2019s alliances in Asia are obsolete. \u201cA declaration of peace is a confidence building measure. Nothing more,\u201d says Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea now at the University of Denver. \u201cThe concern is that it could be used by the North Koreans to argue that the U.S. no longer needs troops in South Korea.\u201d\nWhat might worry America\u2019s allies is the possibility that the two leaders are in harmony on this particular issue. Some 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in the South, while about 50,000 more are in Japan. The security establishment considers this posturing critical to maintaining peace in Northeast Asia and ultimately countering Chinese dominance.\nGet our Politics Newsletter.

In May of last year, he became the first President in more than three decades to suggest a retreat, when he reportedly ordered the Pentagon to explore options for withdrawal. The last time that was so much as considered was under President Jimmy Carter \u2014 when North Korea had neither nuclear weapons nor long-range missiles.\n\u201cIt was a bad idea then, it\u2019s a worse one today,\u201d says Daniel Russel, who served as assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs under the Obama administration and is now at the Asia Society. \u201cPreventing the next war,\u201d he says, \u201cshould be a higher priority than resolving the legal technicalities of the last one.\u201d\nExperts say the de facto peace \u2014 meaning no hot war \u2014 that has held under armistice for more than six decades is better than a premature peace deal. According to Sung-Yoon Lee, professor of Korean Studies at the Fletcher School of Tufts University, ending the war could increase the risk of conflict. A treaty would dissolve the U.S.-led U.N. Command established to keep the peace, and American allies South Korea and Japan risk being abandoned in the crosshairs of an unhinged neighbor.\nBut would that matter if a peace deal was achieved? \u201cNorth Korea has flagrantly violated both the letter and spirit of every single international agreement it has signed,\u201d Lee says. This would be no different.\nRead more: Here\u2019s What We Know About North Korea\u2019s Nuclear Program\nFor Kim\u2019s part, he is expected to offer Trump something that at least resembles a willingness to reduce his country\u2019s arms. But his concessions are likely to fall well short of what the U.S. wants: a full inventory of nuclear assets and weapons of mass destruction; access for international inspectors; the destruction of key facilities; and a moratorium on testing. Kim could offer to decommission the North\u2019s enrichment facilities, but he may already have plenty of material to keep production humming.\nSpotlight Story\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Could Derail Xi Jinping\u2019s Dreams of a Chinese Century\nThe virus looms over the President's national rejuvenation project and his rigid, top-down rule is being tested\n\u201cPyongyang\u2019s behavior shows no willingness to verifiably dismantle its nuclear program, and Kim is likely sincere when he says that his nuclear arsenal is the nation\u2019s \u2018treasured sword\u2019 that no power can remove,\u201d says Russel, of the Asia Society. Kim, he says, will get rid of his weapons only when America\u2019s deterrent is out of his yard and alliances in Asia are broken.\n\u201cThis roughly translates into English as \u2018when Hell freezes over,\u2019\u201d he says.\nMost Popular on TIME\n1\nCoronavirus Tests China\n2\nRepublican Governor Says Trump Shouldn't Be in Office\n3\n'Deeply Problematic.'

                "text": "When Michael Cohen testifies before Congress Wednesday, lawmakers won\u2019t ask about the hottest topic on Capitol Hill: the Trump campaign\u2019s interactions with Russia. But the other issues he discusses may turn out to be just as big a headache for the president.\nTrump\u2019s longtime personal attorney is expected to give dramatic public testimony Wednesday about everything from Trump\u2019s private business to his campaign and his Administration. He is prepared to present a document that criminally implicates Trump in a violation of campaign finance law related to hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, Politico reports.\nDemocrats said they would set aside the topic of Russia for now so as not to interfere with Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s work. But they are just as keen to dig into Trump\u2019s affairs, especially given Cohen\u2019s years of work for the Trump Organization.\n\u201cClearly, there\u2019s no one closer to Donald Trump with respect to his business practices,\u201d Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who chairs the House Democratic caucus, told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we need to hear from Michael Cohen is that information, presented in a transparent fashion, and the American people can make a decision from that.\u201d\nRelated Stories\nU.S.\nSen. Feinstein Calls for Federal Rules on Crash-Warning Systems After Kobe Bryant's Death\nPolitics\nSen. Doug Jones, Vulnerable Alabama Democrat, Says He Will 'Reluctantly' Vote to Convict Trump\nThe hearings show just how much legal hot water Trump is currently in. His private business, family charity, campaign, inauguration, Administration and even his eponymous Washington hotel have been tangled up in various investigations or civil lawsuits. His former campaign chairman, deputy campaign chairman, national security advisor, longtime informal adviser and self-described fixer \u2014 Cohen \u2014 have either pleaded guilty, been found guilty or are currently fighting legal charges.\nAnd Democrats are now in charge of the House of Representatives, where they intend to highlight all of these subjects, starting with Cohen.\nIn a memo outlining the scope of Wednesday\u2019s hearing, chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings said there are multiple lines of inquiry the committee wants to explore with Cohen, including Trump\u2019s \u201cdebts and payments relating to efforts to influence the 2016 election,\u201d \u201ccompliance with campaign finance laws,\u201d \u201ccompliance with tax laws\u201d and Trump\u2019s \u201cbusiness practices,\u201d among other subjects.\nThe most explosive subject is likely to be the arrangement to pay Daniels $130,000 so that she wouldn\u2019t speak publicly about an affair before the election. Cohen will describe in \u201cgranular detail\u201d the arrangement to pay Daniels and will say the plan was initiated by Trump, the New York Times reports.\nThe schedule has now been set. Looking forward to the #American people hearing my story in my voice! #truth https://t.co/DQhLLxhabHhttps://t.co/BCDwQ8zUfl\n\u2014 Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) February 21, 2019\nBut the scope of questioning is likely to be broad, especially since Congress can ask about the truthfulness of Trump\u2019s public statements, said former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti.\nGet our Politics Newsletter.

It\u2019s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.\u201d\nIn a letter to Cummings, House Oversight Committee Republicans wrote, \u201cWhen Cohen appears before our Committee, we can only assume that he will continue his pattern of deceit and perjury.\u201d\nBut Cohen\u2019s highly anticipated testimony still may add to Trump\u2019s problems. Mueller\u2019s investigation is ongoing, multiple other arms of the Justice Department around the country are looking to other questions stemming from the Russia probe and Trump\u2019s business dealings, and congressional committees have launched their own investigations into some of the same questions.\n\u201cThe American people deserve to know whether Donald Trump has been functioning as the President of the United States of America or as the equivalent of an organized crime boss,\u201d said Jeffries. \u201cMichael Cohen can shed some light on that very important question.\u201d\nWith Alana Abramson in Washington\nMost Popular on TIME\n1\nCoronavirus Tests China\n2\nRepublican Governor Says Trump Shouldn't Be in Office\n3\n'Deeply Problematic.'

That's Why Threats Against Them Are So Dangerous </a> </h3>\n<p>&ldquo;The President&rsquo;s constant refrain is that Kim is his &lsquo;friend&rsquo;,&rdquo; said one of the officials, who has tried to present Trump with the unanimous assessment by multiple agencies that Kim remains wedded to his nuclear program, both as a family mission and as a deterrent to any U.S.-led effort to overthrow his regime.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://time.com/5518947/donald-trump-intelligence-briefings-national-security/\"><em>&lsquo;Willful Ignorance.&rsquo; Inside President Trump&rsquo;s Troubled Intelligence Briefings</em></a></p>\n<p>In response to questions about the warnings the President has received, the White House said that Trump supports his advisors. &ldquo;The President has said repeatedly he values his national security and intelligence teams, and that the North Koreans have a major opportunity for a strong economic future if they denuclearize,&rdquo; said White House spokesman Hogan Gidley.</p>\n<p>The State Department declined to comment on-the-record regarding Biegun&rsquo;s blocked outreach. A State Department spokesperson, speaking on background, denied the account. Biegun, speaking at a March 11 conference on nuclear weapons issues in Washington, said &ldquo;diplomacy is still very much alive&rdquo; between the U.S. and the North.</p>\n<p>Government Korea experts remain skeptical of Trump&rsquo;s top-down approach, and dubious that personal chemistry can overcome the North&rsquo;s long-term, strategic thinking. &ldquo;Kim understands that while the President may be somewhat malleable and wants to claim credit for formally ending the Korean Conflict,&rdquo; said one of the officials, &ldquo;His successors might be less so.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>North Korean diplomats publicly say it is up to the U.S. to make the next move. Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said recently that the U.S. must take steps to match its moratorium on missile launches and nuclear tests.</p>\n<p>Trump continues to insist not only that he and Kim can reach an agreement, but also that impoverished North Korea&rsquo;s need for economic development will outweigh its leader&rsquo;s attachment to its existing nuclear arsenal, according to the officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. U.S. intelligence estimates the North has 20-60 nuclear warheads as well as medium-range missiles that can reach targets, including U.S. military bases, in South Korea and Japan, and perhaps as far as the U.S. territory of Guam.</p>\n<h3>Get our Politics Newsletter.

That's Why Threats Against Them Are So Dangerous\n\u201cThe President\u2019s constant refrain is that Kim is his \u2018friend\u2019,\u201d said one of the officials, who has tried to present Trump with the unanimous assessment by multiple agencies that Kim remains wedded to his nuclear program, both as a family mission and as a deterrent to any U.S.-led effort to overthrow his regime.\nRead More: \u2018Willful Ignorance.\u2019 Inside President Trump\u2019s Troubled Intelligence Briefings\nIn response to questions about the warnings the President has received, the White House said that Trump supports his advisors. \u201cThe President has said repeatedly he values his national security and intelligence teams, and that the North Koreans have a major opportunity for a strong economic future if they denuclearize,\u201d said White House spokesman Hogan Gidley.\nThe State Department declined to comment on-the-record regarding Biegun\u2019s blocked outreach. A State Department spokesperson, speaking on background, denied the account. Biegun, speaking at a March 11 conference on nuclear weapons issues in Washington, said \u201cdiplomacy is still very much alive\u201d between the U.S. and the North.\nGovernment Korea experts remain skeptical of Trump\u2019s top-down approach, and dubious that personal chemistry can overcome the North\u2019s long-term, strategic thinking. \u201cKim understands that while the President may be somewhat malleable and wants to claim credit for formally ending the Korean Conflict,\u201d said one of the officials, \u201cHis successors might be less so.\u201d\nNorth Korean diplomats publicly say it is up to the U.S. to make the next move. Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said recently that the U.S. must take steps to match its moratorium on missile launches and nuclear tests.\nTrump continues to insist not only that he and Kim can reach an agreement, but also that impoverished North Korea\u2019s need for economic development will outweigh its leader\u2019s attachment to its existing nuclear arsenal, according to the officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity.

The presence of a third pilot in the cockpit wasn&rsquo;t contained in Indonesia&rsquo;s National Transportation Safety Committee&rsquo;s Nov. 28 report on the crash and hasn&rsquo;t previously been reported.</p>\n<h2>Related Stories</h2>\n<p> <a href=\"https://time.com/5770054/journalist-philip-jacboson-mongabay-arrested-indonesia/\">   <figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Philip-Jacobson-1.jpg?w=400&h=93&quality=85\"></img></figure>   </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/world/\">  World  </a></p>\n<h3> <a href=\"https://time.com/5770054/journalist-philip-jacboson-mongabay-arrested-indonesia/\"> Indonesia Arrests American Journalist Over Visa Issue </a> </h3>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://time.com/5761097/jakarta-indonesia-floods/\">   <figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/indonesia-floods-father-son.jpg?w=600&h=93&quality=85\"></img></figure>   </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/world/\">  World  </a></p>\n<h3> <a href=\"https://time.com/5761097/jakarta-indonesia-floods/\"> What to Know About the Deadly Floods in Indonesia </a> </h3>\n<p>The so-called dead-head pilot on the earlier flight from Bali to Jakarta told the crew to cut power to the motor driving the nose down, according to the people familiar, part of a checklist that all pilots are required to memorize.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;All the data and information that we have on the flight and the aircraft have been submitted to the Indonesian NTSC. We can&rsquo;t provide additional comment at this stage due the ongoing investigation on the accident,&rdquo; Lion Air spokesman Danang Prihantoro said by phone.</p>\n<p>The Indonesia safety committee report said the plane had had multiple failures on previous flights and hadn&rsquo;t been properly repaired.</p>\n<p>Representatives for Boeing and the Indonesian safety committee declined to comment on the earlier flight.</p>\n<p>The safety system, designed to keep planes from climbing too steeply and stalling, has come under scrutiny by investigators of the crash as well as a subsequent one less than five months later in Ethiopia. A malfunctioning sensor is believed to have tricked the Lion Air plane&rsquo;s computers into thinking it needed to automatically bring the nose down to avoid a stall.</p>\n<p>Boeing&rsquo;s 737 Max was grounded March 13 by U.S. regulators after similarities to the Oct. 29 Lion Air crash emerged in the investigation of the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. In the wake of the two accidents, questions have emerged about how Boeing&rsquo;s design of the new 737 model were approved. The Transportation Department&rsquo;s inspector general is conducting a review of how the plane was certified to fly and a grand jury under the U.S. Justice Department is also seeking records in a possible criminal probe of the plane&rsquo;s certification.</p>\n<p>The FAA last week said it planned to mandate changes in the system to make it less likely to activate when there is no emergency. The agency and Boeing said they are also going to require additional training and references to it in flight manuals.</p>\n<h3>Get The Brief.

The company has declined to comment on the criminal probe.</p>\n<p>After the Lion Air crash, two U.S. pilots&rsquo; unions said the potential risks of the system, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, hadn&rsquo;t been sufficiently spelled out in their manuals or training. None of the documentation for the Max aircraft included an explanation, the union leaders said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like that we weren&rsquo;t notified,&rsquo;&rsquo; Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said in November. &ldquo;It makes us question, &lsquo;Is that everything, guys?&rsquo; I would hope there are no more surprises out there.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\n<p>The Allied Pilots Association union at American Airlines Group Inc. also said details about the system weren&rsquo;t included in the documentation about the plane.</p>\n<p>Following the Lion Air crash, the FAA required Boeing to notify airlines about the system and Boeing sent a bulletin to all customers flying the Max reminding them how to disable it in an emergency.</p>\n<p>Authorities have released few details about Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 other than it flew a &ldquo;very similar&rdquo; track as the Lion Air planes and then dove sharply into the ground. There have been no reports of maintenance issues with the Ethiopian Airlines plane before its crash.</p>\n<p>If the same issue is also found to have helped bring down Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, one of the most vexing questions crash investigators and aviation safety consultants are asking is why the pilots on that flight didn&rsquo;t perform the checklist that disables the system.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;After this horrific Lion Air accident, you&rsquo;d think that everyone flying this airplane would know that&rsquo;s how you turn this off,&rdquo; said Steve Wallace, the former director of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration&rsquo;s accident investigation branch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5778994/coronavirus-china-country-future/\">    <figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/TIM200217v1_China.Cover_.jpg?w=321&h=387&quality=85\"></img></figure>     Spotlight Story The Coronavirus Outbreak Could Derail Xi Jinping&rsquo;s Dreams of a Chinese Century The virus looms over the President's national rejuvenation project and his rigid, top-down rule is being tested  </a></p>\n<p>The combination of factors required to bring down a plane in these circumstances suggests other issues may also have occurred in the Ethiopia crash, said Jeffrey Guzzetti, who also directed accident investigations at FAA and is now a consultant.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply implausible that this MCAS deficiency by itself can down a modern jetliner with a trained crew,&rdquo; Guzzetti said.</p>\n<p>MCAS is driven by a single sensor near the nose that measures the so-called angle of attack, or whether air is flowing parallel to the length of the fuselage or at an angle. On the Lion Air flights, the angle-of-attack sensor had failed and was sending erroneous readings indicating the plane&rsquo;s nose was pointed dangerously upward.</p>\n<p>Most Popular on TIME</p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5778994/coronavirus-china-country-future/\"> Coronavirus Tests China  </a></p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5779538/trump-national-prayer-breakfast-politics/\"> 'Deeply Problematic.'

The presence of a third pilot in the cockpit wasn\u2019t contained in Indonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee\u2019s Nov. 28 report on the crash and hasn\u2019t previously been reported.\nRelated Stories\nWorld\nIndonesia Arrests American Journalist Over Visa Issue\nWorld\nWhat to Know About the Deadly Floods in Indonesia\nThe so-called dead-head pilot on the earlier flight from Bali to Jakarta told the crew to cut power to the motor driving the nose down, according to the people familiar, part of a checklist that all pilots are required to memorize.\n\u201cAll the data and information that we have on the flight and the aircraft have been submitted to the Indonesian NTSC. We can\u2019t provide additional comment at this stage due the ongoing investigation on the accident,\u201d Lion Air spokesman Danang Prihantoro said by phone.\nThe Indonesia safety committee report said the plane had had multiple failures on previous flights and hadn\u2019t been properly repaired.\nRepresentatives for Boeing and the Indonesian safety committee declined to comment on the earlier flight.\nThe safety system, designed to keep planes from climbing too steeply and stalling, has come under scrutiny by investigators of the crash as well as a subsequent one less than five months later in Ethiopia. A malfunctioning sensor is believed to have tricked the Lion Air plane\u2019s computers into thinking it needed to automatically bring the nose down to avoid a stall.\nBoeing\u2019s 737 Max was grounded March 13 by U.S. regulators after similarities to the Oct. 29 Lion Air crash emerged in the investigation of the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. In the wake of the two accidents, questions have emerged about how Boeing\u2019s design of the new 737 model were approved. The Transportation Department\u2019s inspector general is conducting a review of how the plane was certified to fly and a grand jury under the U.S. Justice Department is also seeking records in a possible criminal probe of the plane\u2019s certification.\nThe FAA last week said it planned to mandate changes in the system to make it less likely to activate when there is no emergency. The agency and Boeing said they are also going to require additional training and references to it in flight manuals.\nGet The Brief.

The company has declined to comment on the criminal probe.\nAfter the Lion Air crash, two U.S. pilots\u2019 unions said the potential risks of the system, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, hadn\u2019t been sufficiently spelled out in their manuals or training. None of the documentation for the Max aircraft included an explanation, the union leaders said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like that we weren\u2019t notified,\u2019\u2019 Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said in November. \u201cIt makes us question, \u2018Is that everything, guys?\u2019 I would hope there are no more surprises out there.\u2019\u2019\nThe Allied Pilots Association union at American Airlines Group Inc. also said details about the system weren\u2019t included in the documentation about the plane.\nFollowing the Lion Air crash, the FAA required Boeing to notify airlines about the system and Boeing sent a bulletin to all customers flying the Max reminding them how to disable it in an emergency.\nAuthorities have released few details about Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 other than it flew a \u201cvery similar\u201d track as the Lion Air planes and then dove sharply into the ground. There have been no reports of maintenance issues with the Ethiopian Airlines plane before its crash.\nIf the same issue is also found to have helped bring down Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, one of the most vexing questions crash investigators and aviation safety consultants are asking is why the pilots on that flight didn\u2019t perform the checklist that disables the system.\n\u201cAfter this horrific Lion Air accident, you\u2019d think that everyone flying this airplane would know that\u2019s how you turn this off,\u201d said Steve Wallace, the former director of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s accident investigation branch.\nSpotlight Story\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Could Derail Xi Jinping\u2019s Dreams of a Chinese Century\nThe virus looms over the President's national rejuvenation project and his rigid, top-down rule is being tested\nThe combination of factors required to bring down a plane in these circumstances suggests other issues may also have occurred in the Ethiopia crash, said Jeffrey Guzzetti, who also directed accident investigations at FAA and is now a consultant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply implausible that this MCAS deficiency by itself can down a modern jetliner with a trained crew,\u201d Guzzetti said.\nMCAS is driven by a single sensor near the nose that measures the so-called angle of attack, or whether air is flowing parallel to the length of the fuselage or at an angle. On the Lion Air flights, the angle-of-attack sensor had failed and was sending erroneous readings indicating the plane\u2019s nose was pointed dangerously upward.\nMost Popular on TIME\n1\nCoronavirus Tests China\n2\n'Deeply Problematic.'

The questions Biden has faced&mdash;from his handling of the Clarence Thomas hearings to his physical displays of affection&mdash;were entirely predictable. I imagine he himself predicted them.</p>\n<p>When I was White House communications director for President Obama, I saw him express physical affection for women and men both, and he often greeted me warmly with a hug or even a kiss on the forehead. It was unusual behavior for a work setting, yes, but he is someone who has endured a lot of personal loss in his life and wears his emotions on his sleeve. In my experience, his overly affectionate behavior was his way of putting more love and support in the world. That was not all women&rsquo;s experience, though. He clearly made some women uncomfortable, and now he is facing the consequences.</p>\n<h2>Related Stories</h2>\n<p> <a href=\"https://time.com/5778993/iowa-democrats-2020-problems/\">   <figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/iowa-democrats-2020-problems_001.jpg?w=600&h=93&quality=85\"></img></figure>   </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/politics/\">  Politics  </a></p>\n<h3> <a href=\"https://time.com/5778993/iowa-democrats-2020-problems/\"> Forget Iowa.

It May Matter Less Than You Think </a> </h3>\n<p>I have watched expectations rise around Biden with trepidation. A lot of Democrats have set their hopes on him. They anxiously eye Bernie Sanders&rsquo; strong standing&mdash;as a candidate they believe to be too far left. They see a Biden candidacy as a way to recapture the white working-class part of the Obama-Biden magic and win back those Obama voters who turned to Trump. All the while, there&rsquo;s a nostalgic appeal to a Biden presidency: His folksy ways feel like a tonic, an assurance that things can return to &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; A President Joe Biden, the thinking seems to go, would reduce President Donald Trump to a bad dream. Now, suddenly, nothing about a Biden candidacy seems inevitable, including whether there will even be one.</p>\n<p>But it was never fair to make Biden a vessel for Democrats&rsquo; hopes and anxieties. His early standing atop the polls seems like more of a reflection of many Democrats&rsquo; 2016 grieving process than a predictor of who will ultimately win the Democratic primary. No one is going to be able to return America to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and no one&mdash;particularly in a field this large and talented&mdash;can enter the race in first place and expect to stay there.</p>\n<p>In my experience, early frontrunners like Biden face a battle against attrition. Even if he ultimately wins the Democratic primary&mdash;which he still has a good chance of doing&mdash;his support will first likely erode, not grow. He will have to shed all of these false expectations that hang around him now and come back with support that he&rsquo;s earned by being a good candidate for 2020. Any early support based on the assumption that a candidate will do well is fickle.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, given the history of abuse women have endured for&mdash;oh&mdash;all of human history, nuance has unsurprisingly been a hard tool for men to employ in defending their actions. But it&rsquo;s not impossible that the Joe Biden I know could be the one to navigate these waters. Many women have come to his defense in the last few days&mdash;while appropriately respecting, with concern, the unease some women said they experienced.</p>\n<h3>Sign up for Inside TIME.

And assuming he runs, he will need to answer more questions on this topic than I am sure he would like. It won&rsquo;t be fun for him, but that&rsquo;s what he will have to endure to convince voters he has learned the right lessons. In my experience, two qualities define him: the love for his family and an unshakeable belief in the American people. There is an opportunity for him to do some good here, to prove right the women who have stood up for him.</p>\n<p>There are more positions Biden will have to explain. He has been in public life for a long time and has a long record&mdash;built during a period of immense social change&mdash;that has to be reconciled with the country America is today. But there is something of real value at the core of Joe Biden that cannot be denied. It is as foolish to count any candidate out at this point as it was foolish to believe any one candidate was an obvious savior.</p>\n<p><em>This appears in the April 15, 2019 issue of TIME.</em></p>\n<p>Most Popular on TIME</p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5778994/coronavirus-china-country-future/\"> Coronavirus Tests China  </a></p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5779726/republican-governor-phil-scott-trump-abuse-power/\"> Republican Governor Says Trump Shouldn't Be in Office </a></p>\n<p>3</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5779538/trump-national-prayer-breakfast-politics/\"> 'Deeply Problematic.'

                "text": "I am a little surprised that people have been surprised by the rough patch Joe Biden has hit in the past few weeks. The questions Biden has faced\u2014from his handling of the Clarence Thomas hearings to his physical displays of affection\u2014were entirely predictable. I imagine he himself predicted them.\nWhen I was White House communications director for President Obama, I saw him express physical affection for women and men both, and he often greeted me warmly with a hug or even a kiss on the forehead. It was unusual behavior for a work setting, yes, but he is someone who has endured a lot of personal loss in his life and wears his emotions on his sleeve. In my experience, his overly affectionate behavior was his way of putting more love and support in the world. That was not all women\u2019s experience, though. He clearly made some women uncomfortable, and now he is facing the consequences.\nRelated Stories\nPolitics\nForget Iowa. The Democrats Now Have Bigger 2020 Problems\nPolitics\nShould Iowa and New Hampshire Still Vote First? It May Matter Less Than You Think\nI have watched expectations rise around Biden with trepidation. A lot of Democrats have set their hopes on him. They anxiously eye Bernie Sanders\u2019 strong standing\u2014as a candidate they believe to be too far left. They see a Biden candidacy as a way to recapture the white working-class part of the Obama-Biden magic and win back those Obama voters who turned to Trump. All the while, there\u2019s a nostalgic appeal to a Biden presidency: His folksy ways feel like a tonic, an assurance that things can return to \u201cnormal.\u201d A President Joe Biden, the thinking seems to go, would reduce President Donald Trump to a bad dream. Now, suddenly, nothing about a Biden candidacy seems inevitable, including whether there will even be one.\nBut it was never fair to make Biden a vessel for Democrats\u2019 hopes and anxieties. His early standing atop the polls seems like more of a reflection of many Democrats\u2019 2016 grieving process than a predictor of who will ultimately win the Democratic primary. No one is going to be able to return America to \u201cnormal\u201d and no one\u2014particularly in a field this large and talented\u2014can enter the race in first place and expect to stay there.\nIn my experience, early frontrunners like Biden face a battle against attrition. Even if he ultimately wins the Democratic primary\u2014which he still has a good chance of doing\u2014his support will first likely erode, not grow. He will have to shed all of these false expectations that hang around him now and come back with support that he\u2019s earned by being a good candidate for 2020. Any early support based on the assumption that a candidate will do well is fickle.\nAdmittedly, given the history of abuse women have endured for\u2014oh\u2014all of human history, nuance has unsurprisingly been a hard tool for men to employ in defending their actions. But it\u2019s not impossible that the Joe Biden I know could be the one to navigate these waters. Many women have come to his defense in the last few days\u2014while appropriately respecting, with concern, the unease some women said they experienced.\nSign up for Inside TIME.

And assuming he runs, he will need to answer more questions on this topic than I am sure he would like. It won\u2019t be fun for him, but that\u2019s what he will have to endure to convince voters he has learned the right lessons. In my experience, two qualities define him: the love for his family and an unshakeable belief in the American people. There is an opportunity for him to do some good here, to prove right the women who have stood up for him.\nThere are more positions Biden will have to explain. He has been in public life for a long time and has a long record\u2014built during a period of immense social change\u2014that has to be reconciled with the country America is today. But there is something of real value at the core of Joe Biden that cannot be denied. It is as foolish to count any candidate out at this point as it was foolish to believe any one candidate was an obvious savior.\nThis appears in the April 15, 2019 issue of TIME.\nMost Popular on TIME\n1\nCoronavirus Tests China\n2\nRepublican Governor Says Trump Shouldn't Be in Office\n3\n'Deeply Problematic.'

But I also fail to see how any of it will matter without a planet to live on.\nWe are approaching an irreversible tipping point. The science of climate change is backed by examples of the damage mankind has caused all around us, every day and everywhere. None of us are immune anymore; no matter where we live, no matter our political party.\nI can\u2019t think of anything that should compel and demand our attention more. What will it take for our short-sighted leadership to stop questioning the reality of this global crisis?\nIt\u2019s hard to believe, but 49 years ago a new awareness of our environmental responsibilities was born. The founding of Earth Day marked an important moment in time, a pivotal recognition of how precious and fragile and sacred our connection is to our natural world. And on this Earth Day, I find myself searching for words to express my sense of urgency on behalf of our one and only home \u2014 to create yet another new awareness of those same responsibilities.\nRelated Stories\nTech\nEarth Day Google Doodle Celebrates Nature's Diversity\nNewsfeed\nGoogle's Earth Day Doodle Sends an Urgent Message About Climate Change\nPresident Trump has promised to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, appointed climate change deniers to head the EPA, weakened protections for clean air and water, and tried to cut funding efforts to advance renewable energy. He has made terrible decisions followed by worse decisions.\nIt\u2019s heartbreaking, yet we\u2019re all in this mess together.\nIt\u2019d be pretty thoughtless to pretend we\u2019re not divided right now in America. There are many complex reasons for this, but I stubbornly continue to believe that more unites us underneath it all, and that when push comes to shove, we all want a better and healthier future for our children and grandchildren.\nVideo Player is loading.\nCurrent Time 0:00\n/\nDuration 0:00\nLoaded: 0%\nStream Type LIVE\nRemaining Time -0:00\n1x\nChapters\ndescriptions off, selected\ncaptions off, selected\nThis is a modal window.\nAn unanticipated problem was encountered, check back soon and try again\nError Code: MEDIA_ERR_UNKNOWN\nSession ID: 2020-02-07:e2c93405e21e5bf8cbcbf995 Player Element ID: brightcove-7954514\nBeginning of dialog window.

They\u2019ve watched as our leaders unravel protections instead of strengthening them, argue endlessly without doing enough to advance innovation, and pass the buck, hoping someone else will save us.\nWe\u2019ve wasted so much already, but the most tragic loss has been time. I\u2019d give anything to be celebrating this Earth Day with enthusiasm for our progress, pride for our American creativity, global leadership and collaboration in tackling the largest challenges of our times, remembrances of how wasteful and short-term our thinking had once been, and how far we\u2019d come since that first gathering in 1970.\nSign up for Inside TIME.

I suggest we finally make it count by electing leaders who share our vision for the future, our values and impatience and frustrations. By making our voices heard in every local, regional and national election possible, and by encouraging the next generations to take over and demand the changes mine could not deliver. There should be no \u201cclimate change candidates\u201d or \u201cclimate change voters\u201d \u2014 because each one of us should put this issue at the top of our list of why we choose to elect who we do. It\u2019s more important than ever to remember we do not have to share the same motivations to want the same outcomes.\nOur children deserve to look back after 100 Earth Days and breathe a sigh of clean, healthy relief, knowing that when our eyes were wide open, when all the facts were known, we did everything we could for them. We corrected our course, and we changed the outcome.

Beyond the tweets, the rallies, the interviews, the debates, the press conferences, the scandals, the best-selling yet unclearly sourced insider books and the unrelenting braggadocio and aggrandizement, a comprehensive read of the Mueller report brings to life the <a href=\"https://time.com/5573521/donald-trump-obstruction-justice/\">portrait of the man</a> Donald Trump more than anything before it.</p>\n<p>It takes the traits we already knew he exhibited &mdash; his mendacity, his propensity to surround himself with crooks and grifters, and his single-minded self-focus &mdash; and places them in the context of a sweeping narrative about a presidential campaign and presidency devoid of ethics, honor or even strength. The stories paint a picture of a president who is both petty and small, so very small.</p>\n<p>One of the most telling moments occurs on page 102 in the obstruction of justice section of the Special Counsel&rsquo;s analysis. It tells a short version of a story we largely already knew. When Donald Trump&rsquo;s son, Donald Junior, learned that the New York<em> Times</em> was about to break the news of his now-infamous June 9, 2016, meeting in <a href=\"https://time.com/5358931/trump-tower-meeting-claims/\">Trump Tower</a> with Russian lawyer <a href=\"https://time.com/5572821/donald-trump-russia-contacts/\">Natalya Veselnitskaya</a>, his first instinct was to come clean.</p>\n<h2>Related Stories</h2>\n<p> <a href=\"https://time.com/5646063/peter-strzok-fbi-mueller-trump-fired-lawsuit/\">   <figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fbi-peter-strzok-sues-firing.jpg?w=600&h=93&quality=85\"></img></figure>   </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/politics/\">  Politics  </a></p>\n<h3> <a href=\"https://time.com/5646063/peter-strzok-fbi-mueller-trump-fired-lawsuit/\"> Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok Sues Over 'Unlawful' Firing </a> </h3>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://time.com/5635276/mueller-testimony-obstruction-conspiracy-analysis/\">   <figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/robert-mueller-testimony-analysis.jpg?w=528&h=93&quality=85\"></img></figure>   </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/ideas/\">  Ideas  </a></p>\n<h3> <a href=\"https://time.com/5635276/mueller-testimony-obstruction-conspiracy-analysis/\"> This Might Be the Most Important Exchange in the Mueller Testimony </a> </h3>\n<p>He drafted a statement that began, &ldquo;I was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew &hellip; with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the <a href=\"https://time.com/5541532/robert-mueller-trump-russia-investigation/\">campaign</a>.&rdquo; But his father said no. His father demanded that the statement be revised to omit the motivation for the meeting. <a href=\"https://time.com/4858423/donald-trump-donald-jr-russia-meeting-interview/\">Donald Jr</a>. complied and misled America.</p>\n<p>Think for a moment about that story. With his campaign in the media crosshairs, President Trump threw his son under the bus. He made his son transmit his own deceptions. He exposed his son to the scorn and ridicule he so richly deserved.</p>\n<p>There are other important moments in the report. Here&rsquo;s one we didn&rsquo;t know before. According to <a href=\"https://time.com/5573091/mueller-report-how-to-read/\">the report</a>, in June 2017, President Trump dictated a message for his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski &mdash; who had been fired in June 2016, a few months after a misdemeanor battery charge against him had been brought and then dropped &mdash; to dictate to then Attorney General <a href=\"https://time.com/5450249/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-matthew-whitaker/\">Jeff Sessions</a>. Trump was directing Sessions to essentially reverse his recusal from the Russian investigation to narrow the scope of the Special Counsel&rsquo;s investigation. Trump wanted Mueller to merely investigate &ldquo;election meddling for future elections.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lewandowski never delivered <a href=\"https://time.com/5573387/mueller-report-obstruction-justice-public/\">Trump&rsquo;s message</a>. He scheduled a meeting with Sessions, but when Sessions canceled, <a href=\"https://time.com/5573387/mueller-report-obstruction-justice-public/\">Lewandowski</a> never followed through. A disgraced former campaign manager felt free to disregard a directive from the President of the United States.</p>\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s difficult to overestimate</strong> the extent to which <a href=\"https://time.com/5573768/mueller-report-trump-russian-contacts/\">Trump&rsquo;s appeal</a> to his core supporters is built around the notion that &mdash; regardless of his other flaws &mdash; he possesses a core strength, a willingness to &ldquo;fight&rdquo; and an ability to strike a degree of fear in the hearts of his opponents. I live in the heart of Trump country in Tennessee, and I have consistently heard the same refrain from his most <a href=\"https://time.com/4804333/donald-trump-pittsburgh-not-paris-rally/\">loyal supporters</a>. Trump, as they say, &ldquo;kicks ass.&rdquo; He was the ultimate alpha male, a political version of Tony Soprano, a formidable boss who commands an army of loyal consiglieri.

When one reads Robert Mueller&rsquo;s account of Trump&rsquo;s own campaign chair&rsquo;s extraordinary efforts to maintain an encrypted connection to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs, it&rsquo;s plain that <a href=\"https://time.com/5573537/mueller-report-russia-election-interference/\">Trump was played</a>. <a href=\"https://time.com/5547607/paul-manafort-sentencing-donald-trump/\">Paul Manafort</a> used Trump&rsquo;s gullibility as a business opportunity.</p>\n<p>But that&rsquo;s the tip of the iceberg. Trump&rsquo;s national security adviser, <a href=\"https://time.com/5483049/michael-flynn-sentencing-postponed/\">Michael Flynn</a>, didn&rsquo;t just lie to the FBI; he lied to members of his own administration. Trump&rsquo;s informal adviser, Roger Stone, didn&rsquo;t have the access to Wikileaks that he publicly boasted about. Trump&rsquo;s son, son-in-law and campaign chair had the terrible judgment to take a meeting with a Russian in the explicit hope of gaining &ldquo;dirt&rdquo; on <a href=\"https://time.com/5573539/trump-clinton-russia-hack-joke/\">Hillary Clinton</a> to support an admitted Russian plan to help Trump. None of this is admirable. All of it speaks to Trump&rsquo;s critical flaws.</p>\n<p>The Mueller report stands as a monument to reality. It plainly and clearly makes the case that Donald Trump is not the man his supporters think he is. He&rsquo;s not bold. <a href=\"https://time.com/5573385/donald-trump-mueller-reaction/\">He&rsquo;s afraid</a>. They attributed to him a primitive form of loyalty, where he was good to people who were good to him. Instead, he&rsquo;d harm his own son to win a single news cycle. His foolish hiring decisions have come back to <a href=\"https://time.com/5572821/donald-trump-russia-contacts/\">haunt him</a> time and again.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5778994/coronavirus-china-country-future/\">    <figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/TIM200217v1_China.Cover_.jpg?w=321&h=387&quality=85\"></img></figure>     Spotlight Story The Coronavirus Outbreak Could Derail Xi Jinping&rsquo;s Dreams of a Chinese Century The virus looms over the President's national rejuvenation project and his rigid, top-down rule is being tested  </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5573095/mueller-report-william-barr-trump-obstruction-of-justice/\">President Trump is weak</a> &mdash; too weak even to commit <a href=\"https://time.com/5568562/donald-trump-obstruction-justice-mueller-report/\">the acts of obstruction he desired</a>.

He&rsquo;s not wise. He&rsquo;s not honorable. And sometimes, when his subordinates disregard his orders, he&rsquo;s not even truly the president.

                "text": "We now know for sure what kind of man Donald Trump is. Beyond the tweets, the rallies, the interviews, the debates, the press conferences, the scandals, the best-selling yet unclearly sourced insider books and the unrelenting braggadocio and aggrandizement, a comprehensive read of the Mueller report brings to life the portrait of the man Donald Trump more than anything before it.\nIt takes the traits we already knew he exhibited \u2014 his mendacity, his propensity to surround himself with crooks and grifters, and his single-minded self-focus \u2014 and places them in the context of a sweeping narrative about a presidential campaign and presidency devoid of ethics, honor or even strength. The stories paint a picture of a president who is both petty and small, so very small.\nOne of the most telling moments occurs on page 102 in the obstruction of justice section of the Special Counsel\u2019s analysis. It tells a short version of a story we largely already knew. When Donald Trump\u2019s son, Donald Junior, learned that the New York Times was about to break the news of his now-infamous June 9, 2016, meeting in Trump Tower with Russian lawyer Natalya Veselnitskaya, his first instinct was to come clean.\nRelated Stories\nPolitics\nFormer FBI Agent Peter Strzok Sues Over 'Unlawful' Firing\nIdeas\nThis Might Be the Most Important Exchange in the Mueller Testimony\nHe drafted a statement that began, \u201cI was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew \u2026 with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign.\u201d But his father said no. His father demanded that the statement be revised to omit the motivation for the meeting. Donald Jr. complied and misled America.\nThink for a moment about that story. With his campaign in the media crosshairs, President Trump threw his son under the bus. He made his son transmit his own deceptions. He exposed his son to the scorn and ridicule he so richly deserved.\nThere are other important moments in the report. Here\u2019s one we didn\u2019t know before. According to the report, in June 2017, President Trump dictated a message for his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski \u2014 who had been fired in June 2016, a few months after a misdemeanor battery charge against him had been brought and then dropped \u2014 to dictate to then Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trump was directing Sessions to essentially reverse his recusal from the Russian investigation to narrow the scope of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation. Trump wanted Mueller to merely investigate \u201celection meddling for future elections.\u201d\nLewandowski never delivered Trump\u2019s message. He scheduled a meeting with Sessions, but when Sessions canceled, Lewandowski never followed through. A disgraced former campaign manager felt free to disregard a directive from the President of the United States.\nIt\u2019s difficult to overestimate the extent to which Trump\u2019s appeal to his core supporters is built around the notion that \u2014 regardless of his other flaws \u2014 he possesses a core strength, a willingness to \u201cfight\u201d and an ability to strike a degree of fear in the hearts of his opponents. I live in the heart of Trump country in Tennessee, and I have consistently heard the same refrain from his most loyal supporters. Trump, as they say, \u201ckicks ass.\u201d He was the ultimate alpha male, a political version of Tony Soprano, a formidable boss who commands an army of loyal consiglieri.

When one reads Robert Mueller\u2019s account of Trump\u2019s own campaign chair\u2019s extraordinary efforts to maintain an encrypted connection to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs, it\u2019s plain that Trump was played. Paul Manafort used Trump\u2019s gullibility as a business opportunity.\nBut that\u2019s the tip of the iceberg. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, didn\u2019t just lie to the FBI; he lied to members of his own administration. Trump\u2019s informal adviser, Roger Stone, didn\u2019t have the access to Wikileaks that he publicly boasted about. Trump\u2019s son, son-in-law and campaign chair had the terrible judgment to take a meeting with a Russian in the explicit hope of gaining \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton to support an admitted Russian plan to help Trump. None of this is admirable. All of it speaks to Trump\u2019s critical flaws.\nThe Mueller report stands as a monument to reality. It plainly and clearly makes the case that Donald Trump is not the man his supporters think he is. He\u2019s not bold. He\u2019s afraid. They attributed to him a primitive form of loyalty, where he was good to people who were good to him. Instead, he\u2019d harm his own son to win a single news cycle. His foolish hiring decisions have come back to haunt him time and again.\nSpotlight Story\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Could Derail Xi Jinping\u2019s Dreams of a Chinese Century\nThe virus looms over the President's national rejuvenation project and his rigid, top-down rule is being tested\nPresident Trump is weak \u2014 too weak even to commit the acts of obstruction he desired. As the Mueller report stated, Trump\u2019s attempts to influence the investigation \u201cwere mostly unsuccessful,\u201d but it\u2019s \u201clargely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.\u201d He\u2019s not strong. He\u2019s not wise. He\u2019s not honorable. And sometimes, when his subordinates disregard his orders, he\u2019s not even truly the president. Regardless of his potential criminality, there is nothing revealed in the report that is admirable \u2014 or alpha \u2014 about Donald Trump.\nMost Popular on TIME\n1\nCoronavirus Tests China\n2\nRepublican Governor Says Trump Shouldn't Be in Office\n3\n'Deeply Problematic.'

Kim Reynolds has included 41 of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties in her state disaster declaration, according to the Associated Press. Several rivers in the region \u2014 including the Missouri and the Mississippi \u2014 have swelled to dangerous levels, flooding small towns and breaching more than a dozen levees.\nThree people have died as a result of the floodwaters and two men in Nebraska have been missing since Thursday, according to the Associated Press.\nEmergencies have been declared in 74 cities and 65 counties according to the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, and water levels are expected to rise with more rain expected and snow continuing to melt. According to the National Weather Service, 9 million people across 14 states are still under flood warnings.\nVice President Mike Pence is traveling to the Midwest Tuesday to survey the damage in Omaha, Nebraska, where hundreds of homes have been damaged and tens of thousands of acres covered in water, according to the Associated Press.\nDevastation has been particularly concentrated in eastern Nebraska. The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency described the flooding as one of \u201cthe most devastating disasters in recent history.\u201d Towns like Fremont have been completely surrounded by water, making relief and rescue efforts particularly challenging.\nPilots have been flying supplies in to people who are stranded, according to local media.

That period covers a second potential term for Trump, who needs a policy win for his reelection campaign. He&rsquo;s certainly out to sell this deal as a win, even if talks collapse and there ends up being no deal.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to win either way. We either win by getting a deal or we win by not getting a deal,&rdquo; the president <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-trump/trump-on-china-trade-spat-were-going-to-win-either-way-idUSKCN1RR242\">said</a> at a business roundtable in Burnsville, Minnesota, on Monday.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"> <figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6a3f63e8-3d5b-499e-a27e-15e88ecb4603/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=840&height=473\"></img></figure></a>   </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/e9803cf5-0e3e-412e-9de7-0b2492c2eb9d/7894.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=394&width=700\"></img></figure>\n<p>This a tough sell to anyone who has seen the numbers: The trade war with China has cost U.S. importers <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~reddings/papers/CEPR-DP13564.pdf\">at least $19.2 billion</a> after factoring in tariff revenues &mdash; that&rsquo;s in addition to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/china-trade-war-cost-tops-40-billion-in-us-exports/2019/02/28/a5247c3c-3b75-11e9-b10b-f05a22e75865_story.html?utm_term=.f7b4f8504405\">$40 billion in lost exports</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/china-trade-war-trump-blames-gm-for-job-losses-caused-by-his-tariffs-2018-11\">prices raised, and jobs lost</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If the U.S. recaptures the level of exports to China that existed prior to the trade war, it will never make up for the economic damage done to farmers and the rural economy from the tariffs and the drop in U.S. exports.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s efforts to build a border wall have been stymied by Congress, his efforts to denuclearize North Korea have stalled, and even his free trade deal with Canada and Mexico is yet to be ratified by lawmakers in those countries or in the United States nearly five months after it was signed. Anxious for deliverables to his base, Trump has been promising that the deal is almost done since February.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll probably know over the next four weeks. It may take two weeks after that to get it papered&hellip; and it&rsquo;s looking very good,&rdquo; Trump told reporters at the White House earlier this month. He added that U.S. negotiators had hammered out &ldquo;some of the toughest &mdash; really, the tougher points.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But even as he&rsquo;s saying how good the deal is, the president appears to know that it needs to be better, and is reportedly pushing for China to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/21/trump-wants-china-to-raise-its-offer-to-buy-us-goods-to-strike-a-trade-deal-sources-say.html\">double or triple</a> the $1.2 trillion in U.S. imports over six years. He has also <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-15/china-said-to-weigh-u-s-request-to-shift-tariffs-on-farm-goods\">asked China to lift $50 billion in agricultural tariffs</a>, which have been hitting states that comprise of a wide swath of <a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/economics/video/china-s-tariff-retaliation-against-u-s-hitting-trump-s-base-hardest-economist~1361623\">the president&rsquo;s voter base</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/midwest-farmers-trump-tariffs-trade-war-china-ca9ffa97ab5c/\"><figure> <picture data-id=\"1122555\"\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1920px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-973885196.jpg?w=1024&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C683px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1920px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-973885196.jpg?w=1024&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C683px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-973885196.jpg?w=1024&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C683px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 1024px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-973885196.jpg?w=1024&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C683px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-973885196.jpg?w=768&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C512px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(max-width: 512px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-973885196.jpg?w=512&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C342px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-973885196.jpg?w=768&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C512px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"all\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-973885196.jpg?w=1024&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C683px&ssl=1\"></source><img alt=\"Farmer John Duffy drives a load of soybeans to the grain elevator on June 13, 2018 in Dwight, Illinois.

Plus, China&rsquo;s tariffs on U.S. goods <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-farmers-fear-china-deal-080000327.html\">might remain in place for another year</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If the U.S. recaptures the level of exports to China that existed prior to the trade war it will never make up for the economic damage done to farmers and the rural economy from the tariffs and the drop in U.S. exports,&rdquo; said Gale Lush, chairman of American Corn Growers Foundation, in an email to ThinkProgress.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We expect the U.S. will be lucky to go back to the export levels that existed before the trade war given the fact that competitor export countries are gearing up their output and exports to capture opportunities for their producers,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<h2>What the deal won&rsquo;t fix</h2>\n<p>Trump did not specify the &ldquo;tougher points&rdquo; he referenced in the press conference earlier this month, but the now-grounded <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3002427/china-may-drop-boeing-737-max-trade-deal-us\">Boeing 737-Max planes</a>, which were to be part of the deal, and the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FINAL-China-Technology-Report-6.18.18-PDF.pdf\">forced transfer of intellectual property</a> are considered sticking points.</p>\n<p>China essentially denies forcing companies to hand over intellectual property as a condition of getting a license to do business there. In March, it <a href=\"https://npcobserver.com/2019/03/15/summary-of-chinas-new-foreign-investment-law/\">adopted</a> a new foreign investment law that loosened some of the regulations on foreign businesses. China also <a href=\"https://chinaipr.com/2019/03/18/the-tier-is-revised/\">revised</a> its Technology Import/Export Regulations (TIER) system, removing some administrative regulations.</p>\n<p>In order to comply with World Trade Organization rules, China essentially tells companies that <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-chinese-cybersecurity-standards-impact-doing-business-china\">it&rsquo;s optional for them to hand over intellectual property</a>. In practice, generally, companies that choose not to share that data &mdash; which will then be mined and duplicated by Chinese companies, edging the foreign company out of the market in short order &mdash; will not be permitted to do business in China, though the reason for that won&rsquo;t be articulated in writing.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth Chien-Hale, an attorney specializing in international intellectual property protection, told ThinkProgress that China sees the new laws and TIER revisions as a &ldquo;major concession&hellip;.now there is a basis to claim an action, as opposed to before.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>These changes, said Chien-Hale, are in some measure responding to the pressure from the Trump administration, but they were also long in the making as China&rsquo;s tech manufacturing capacities improve and the need for the earlier restrictions recedes.</p>\n<p>But the new laws and revisions are not without backdoors &mdash; or, as Chien-Hale puts it, &ldquo;other ways to support what has been removed&rdquo; (via, say, judicial interpretation). It is also worth noting that Trump has refused to lift the tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s unclear is whether China has negotiated lower prices for the goods it is buying from the United States. The deal also makes the United States more reliant on China at a time when it could be diversifying its trading partners, as <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/12/why-the-u-s-needs-allies-in-a-trade-war-against-china\">recommended</a> by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/china-is-not-the-economic-superpower-people-think-thats-why-its-important-to-wait-it-out/2018/12/21/cf9999bc-03b1-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html?utm_term=.d9df3126aeed\">some analysts</a>, and using that as leverage in future negotiations.</p>\n<p>Trump slapped the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/07/06/us-imposes-tariffs-on-34-billion-worth-of-chinese-goods.html\">first round of tariffs</a> on China in July 2018<strong>,</strong> accusing the country, as many others have, of unfair trade practices. China responded, starting off a chain of tit-for-tat tariffs that sent global markets on a rollercoaster ride, at times increasing U.S. trade deficits with China, and costing U.S. businesses billions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Citing trade tensions and protectionism, the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-worldbank/trade-rows-cloud-global-economy-as-officials-fret-over-slowdown-idUSKCN1RP0KE\">cut its global growth outlook</a> to the lowest in a decade.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s trade war created stock market volatility, even as he looks to place the blame elsewhere &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-slips-as-trump-blames-fed-for-markets-not-trading-more-bullishly-2019-04-15\">including the Federal Reserve</a> &mdash; but the lasting legacy of these trade tensions, fears Lush, will be further damage to America&rsquo;s farms.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Farmers well remember the Nixon embargo of U.S. soybeans to Japan and how it caused the U.S. to be view[ed] as an unreliable supplier. Then Japan invested in Brazilian soybean production and infrastructure,&rdquo; said Lush. &ldquo;As a result it transformed Brazil from a minor export competitor to a country that now exports more soybeans than the U.S. This is what comes of bad U.S. trade policy.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "After months of stop-and-go negotiations with China the talks are said to be in the final rounds, with a new trade deal anticipated in the next few weeks.\nWhile few details are known, what\u2019s clear is that on the U.S. side, there will essentially be one big winner in the deal: President Donald Trump, who will claim it as a political victory.\nThe big selling point for the deal is that over the next six years, China will purchase up to $1.2 trillion in U.S. goods, translating to an additional $30 billion a year in American agricultural exports. That period covers a second potential term for Trump, who needs a policy win for his reelection campaign. He\u2019s certainly out to sell this deal as a win, even if talks collapse and there ends up being no deal.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to win either way. We either win by getting a deal or we win by not getting a deal,\u201d the president said at a business roundtable in Burnsville, Minnesota, on Monday.\nThis a tough sell to anyone who has seen the numbers: The trade war with China has cost U.S. importers at least $19.2 billion after factoring in tariff revenues \u2014 that\u2019s in addition to $40 billion in lost exports, prices raised, and jobs lost.\n\u201cIf the U.S. recaptures the level of exports to China that existed prior to the trade war, it will never make up for the economic damage done to farmers and the rural economy from the tariffs and the drop in U.S. exports.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s efforts to build a border wall have been stymied by Congress, his efforts to denuclearize North Korea have stalled, and even his free trade deal with Canada and Mexico is yet to be ratified by lawmakers in those countries or in the United States nearly five months after it was signed. Anxious for deliverables to his base, Trump has been promising that the deal is almost done since February.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll probably know over the next four weeks. It may take two weeks after that to get it papered\u2026 and it\u2019s looking very good,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House earlier this month. He added that U.S. negotiators had hammered out \u201csome of the toughest \u2014 really, the tougher points.\u201d\nBut even as he\u2019s saying how good the deal is, the president appears to know that it needs to be better, and is reportedly pushing for China to double or triple the $1.2 trillion in U.S. imports over six years. He has also asked China to lift $50 billion in agricultural tariffs, which have been hitting states that comprise of a wide swath of the president\u2019s voter base.\nTwo of the hardest-hit industries in America \u2014 the soy and corn farmers \u2014 aren\u2019t sure they can recover, even with the extra $30 billion a year in sales. Plus, China\u2019s tariffs on U.S. goods might remain in place for another year.\n\u201cIf the U.S. recaptures the level of exports to China that existed prior to the trade war it will never make up for the economic damage done to farmers and the rural economy from the tariffs and the drop in U.S. exports,\u201d said Gale Lush, chairman of American Corn Growers Foundation, in an email to ThinkProgress.\n\u201cWe expect the U.S. will be lucky to go back to the export levels that existed before the trade war given the fact that competitor export countries are gearing up their output and exports to capture opportunities for their producers,\u201d he said.\nWhat the deal won\u2019t fix\nTrump did not specify the \u201ctougher points\u201d he referenced in the press conference earlier this month, but the now-grounded Boeing 737-Max planes, which were to be part of the deal, and the forced transfer of intellectual property are considered sticking points.\nChina essentially denies forcing companies to hand over intellectual property as a condition of getting a license to do business there. In March, it adopted a new foreign investment law that loosened some of the regulations on foreign businesses. China also revised its Technology Import/Export Regulations (TIER) system, removing some administrative regulations.\nIn order to comply with World Trade Organization rules, China essentially tells companies that it\u2019s optional for them to hand over intellectual property. In practice, generally, companies that choose not to share that data \u2014 which will then be mined and duplicated by Chinese companies, edging the foreign company out of the market in short order \u2014 will not be permitted to do business in China, though the reason for that won\u2019t be articulated in writing.\nElizabeth Chien-Hale, an attorney specializing in international intellectual property protection, told ThinkProgress that China sees the new laws and TIER revisions as a \u201cmajor concession\u2026.now there is a basis to claim an action, as opposed to before.\u201d\nThese changes, said Chien-Hale, are in some measure responding to the pressure from the Trump administration, but they were also long in the making as China\u2019s tech manufacturing capacities improve and the need for the earlier restrictions recedes.\nBut the new laws and revisions are not without backdoors \u2014 or, as Chien-Hale puts it, \u201cother ways to support what has been removed\u201d (via, say, judicial interpretation). It is also worth noting that Trump has refused to lift the tariffs on Chinese goods.\nWhat\u2019s unclear is whether China has negotiated lower prices for the goods it is buying from the United States. The deal also makes the United States more reliant on China at a time when it could be diversifying its trading partners, as recommended by some analysts, and using that as leverage in future negotiations.\nTrump slapped the first round of tariffs on China in July 2018, accusing the country, as many others have, of unfair trade practices. China responded, starting off a chain of tit-for-tat tariffs that sent global markets on a rollercoaster ride, at times increasing U.S. trade deficits with China, and costing U.S. businesses billions of dollars.\nCiting trade tensions and protectionism, the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its global growth outlook to the lowest in a decade.\nTrump\u2019s trade war created stock market volatility, even as he looks to place the blame elsewhere \u2014 including the Federal Reserve \u2014 but the lasting legacy of these trade tensions, fears Lush, will be further damage to America\u2019s farms.\n\u201cFarmers well remember the Nixon embargo of U.S. soybeans to Japan and how it caused the U.S. to be view[ed] as an unreliable supplier. Then Japan invested in Brazilian soybean production and infrastructure,\u201d said Lush. \u201cAs a result it transformed Brazil from a minor export competitor to a country that now exports more soybeans than the U.S. This is what comes of bad U.S. trade policy.\u201d",

                "html": "<p>The Democratic establishment &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?cycle=2018&ind=H\">deep in the pockets of the health industry</a> &mdash; wanted to make sure any <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?cycle=2018&ind=H\">blue wave </a>election in 2018 would help sink, rather than support, the growing movement for a single-payer health care system. The recent decline in co-sponsors of the House Medicare for All legislation is, in part, a byproduct of this strategy and a reminder of the great obstacles corporate Democrats have put in front of the single-payer movement.</p>\n<p>In 2018, there were <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676/cosponsors\">124 cosponsors</a> for the Medicare for All bill in the House (then <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676\">H.R. 676</a>), representing 66 percent of the Democratic Caucus. This was celebrated widely as a high-water mark for the legislation. So was the release of <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/sanders-s-bill-electrifies-growing-single-payer-movement/\">Bernie Sanders&rsquo;s Medicare for All bill in the Senate</a>, which also got a record 16 co-sponsors, including prominent Democrats who are running for president.</p>\n<p>Given that the Democrats gained 35 seats in the 2018 midterm and Medicare for All has been polling extremely high among Democratic voters &mdash; a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-progressives/\">survey by <em>Reuters </em></a>from August 2018 showed around 85 percent of Democrats supported the policy &mdash; many were hopeful that the number of cosponsors would rise even higher in the current Congress.</p>\n<aside><h2>The stories you care about, right at your fingertips</h2> <p>Get Truthout&rsquo;s daily edition delivered to your inbox.</p>  </aside>\n<p>Despite this hope, when Rep. Pramila Jayapal introduced the new flagship Medicare for All bill (<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1384\">H.R. 1384</a>), the amount of co-sponsors <em>decreased</em> considerably to 106, down to 47 percent of the caucus. So why, if Democratic voters are moving left on health care, is this not reflected in Congress? Where did all the co-sponsors go?</p>\n<p>A <em>Truthout</em> analysis shows the primary reasons for this decline are: 1) incumbents who once supported Medicare for All who have defected, and 2) a largely disappointing freshman class.</p>\n<p>The most well-known faces of the freshman class are progressives, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, thanks to their ambitious proposals and popular support. This might give the impression to the public that this is reflective of the whole class. The majority of the newest House Democrats, however, were shaped strongly by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the New Democratic Coalition. About 71 percent (42 of 59) of freshman House members declined to co-sponsor the legislation. Some freshman candidates who ran on the issue during the campaign, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/harleyrouda/status/926656256462299136\">like Harley Rouda </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/harleyrouda/status/926656256462299136\">of</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/harleyrouda/status/926656256462299136\"> California</a>, still declined to co-sponsor Jayapal&rsquo;s bill.</p>\n<p>In happier news for the movement, three incumbent Democrats decided to co-sponsor Medicare for All for the first time: Reps. Joseph Kennedy and William Keating of Massachusetts, and Susan Wild of Pennsylvania. However, 29 of the Democrats who were previously co-sponsors have defected this year. Why are Medicare for All&rsquo;s congressional supporters backing out?</p>\n<h2><strong>Incumbent Democrats Turning Away</strong></h2>\n<p>It is much less courageous for members of Congress to co-sponsor legislation that has no chance of passing. So last year, as members of Congress quickly signed on to H.R. 676 some suspicious names appeared on the list (like Joseph Crowley, who had never hinted at support for the policy until he faced Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the primary). In the minority, they could add their names while, behind closed doors, giving viable explanations to donors: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it has no chance of passing &mdash; I am just getting re-elected.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Now that Democrats control the House, this calculus changes for many. Sure enough, <a href=\"https://spacecommune.com/why-have-29-congressional-democrats-stopped-supporting-medicare-for-all-in-2019/\">29 incumbents</a> who previously co-sponsored H.R. 676 have failed to co-sponsor the newer bill, which recently was made stronger to <a href=\"https://indypendent.org/2019/02/medicare-for-all-act-introduced-in-the-house/\">include long-term care for elderly and disabled Americans</a>. Among these defectors are Reps. Elijah Cummings, Hakeem Jeffries and Marcy Kaptur.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s another painful but important lesson about the limits of politely pushing elected officials to the left,&rdquo; writes <a href=\"https://spacecommune.com/why-have-29-congressional-democrats-stopped-supporting-medicare-for-all-in-2019/\">Alex Panagiotopoulos</a>, who analyzed the defections. &ldquo;Just because they co-sponsor or promise to support legislation doesn&rsquo;t mean [they will] expend any political capital to make it happen.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Adam Gaffney, president of Physicians for a National Health Program, told <em>Truthout </em>that the most important thing is to keep pressuring candidates to support the legislation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The movement has been putting pressure on Democrats [that] don&rsquo;t support it, this kind of work must continue,&rdquo; he said. (Gaffney recently impressed many with his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/briebriejoy/status/1101647473087574016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1101647473087574016&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.commondreams.org%2Fnews%2F2019%2F03%2F02%2Fone-best-cases-single-payer-ive-ever-seen-watch-dr-adam-gaffney-take-skeptics-fox\">stirring defense of Medicare for All on Fox Business News</a>.)</p>\n<h2><strong>Why the Freshman Class Is Largely Unsupportive of Single-Payer </strong></h2>\n<p>When people think of the freshman class of Democrats, the most recognizable names tend to be Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. This makes sense, as they are pushing popular policies &mdash; and are constantly attacked by Republicans.</p>\n<p>These strong voices of dissent, however, are in the minority in the new Congress. By and large, the freshman class of House Democrats has refused to support single-payer in practice. Of the 59 freshman Democrats elected to Congress this year, only 17 of them (a woeful 29 percent) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justicedems/status/1101205672119681024?lang=en\">co-sponsored</a> H.R. 1834.</p>\n<p>This was not by chance. It can be traced to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/totals.php?cmte=DCCC&cycle=2012\">Democratic National Campaign Committee</a> (DCCC) and the corporatist <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.php?cycle=2018&cmte=C00409730\">New Democratic Coalition </a>in the House (and its affiliated NewDemPAC). Long before the 2018 midterms were underway, Democratic Party power brokers and fundraisers were militant in trying to keep prospective members of Congress in line going into the 2018 election. This included pleading with new candidates not to support single-payer or, as <em>The Intercept</em> reported with corroborating audio, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/04/26/steny-hoyer-audio-levi-tillemann/\">trying to bully progressives </a>out of the races altogether, depriving voters of a chance to weigh in. Establishment Democrats&rsquo; goal was, as Politico reported, to &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/08/democratic-single-payer-health-care-ads-609066\">neutralize the threat</a>&rdquo; of single-payer.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Democratic voters want single payer health care. But don&rsquo;t expect to hear Democratic candidates talk about it,&rdquo; the report said. &ldquo;To avoid divisive intraparty fights that drive candidates left &mdash; only to be attacked by Republicans for favoring socialized medicine &mdash; the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee warned aspirants last year about the political liabilities of endorsing &lsquo;single-payer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Until the <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/how-sanders-shaped-the-national-discourse-on-class-a-media-analysis/\">Bernie Sanders campaign in 2016</a>, single-payer was not recognized by most media and politicians as a mainstream proposal (despite its popularity among the public). Sanders <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/single-payer-health-care-is-seeing-record-support-in-congress/\">energized </a>the movement, putting powerful Democrats and industry stakeholders on guard.</p>\n<p>Surely, the leadership of the New Democratic Coalition and similarly minded organizations chalk this up <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1101816734401658882\">to another victory </a>for the &ldquo;vital center.&rdquo; They, like House Speaker <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/03/single-payer-health-care-medicare-obamacare-sanders-clinton-democrats\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, argue the voters aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;ready&rdquo; for single-payer, despite its massive popularity. This is a rather dubious interpretation, however, given that the DCCC <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/dccc-democratic-primaries-congress-progressives/\">deprived many voters of a chance</a> to vote for a single-payer candidate in their district. Candidates were hand-picked by party officials in many instances, as the Hoyer tape proved.</p>\n<p>When seeking candidates in 2018, the DCCC <a href=\"https://www.tarbell.org/2018/08/top-democrats-are-taking-health-care-industry-cash-then-opposing-candidates-who-support-medicare-for-all/\">embraced the centrist/corporate Third Way agenda</a>. The New Democratic Coalition, which preaches free markets and is funded largely by Wall Street, endorsed 27 candidates in the 2018 primary. The DCCC, the primary fundraising institution for the House, <a href=\"https://www.tarbell.org/2018/08/top-democrats-are-taking-health-care-industry-cash-then-opposing-candidates-who-support-medicare-for-all/\">endorsed 25 of these 27 candidates</a> via its<a href=\"https://redtoblue.dccc.org/\"> Red to Blue list</a>. This provided money, support, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/3/7/17084808/dccc-laura-moser-texas-democratic-primary-2018\">opposition research</a> and more, giving these candidates a huge advantage in the primaries. As a result, candidates supporting single-payer found themselves being thwarted, attacked and outspent by their own party leaders, who were defying the wishes of most of their base.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/23/17043994/dccc-laura-moser-texas-opposition-memo\">unleashed a scorched-earth campaign</a> against [House candidate Laura Moser of Texas],&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/3/7/17084808/dccc-laura-moser-texas-democratic-primary-2018\">reported <em>Vox</em>,</a> &ldquo;releasing an opposition memo highlighting past statements Moser made seemingly denigrating her home state.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Moser, a single-payer supporter, lost to the DCCC&rsquo;s choice, Lizzy Fletcher, in the primary. Fletcher won the seat and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justicedems/status/1101205672119681024?lang=en\">failed to co-sponsor </a>the new Medicare for All bill.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the DCCC did not support any of the same House candidates endorsed by the Bernie Sanders-founded organization, Our Revolution, which endorses candidates with a range of progressive views on single-payer and beyond.</p>\n<p>The New Democratic Coalition saw 16 of its endorsed candidates win in 2018. Of these 16 candidates, only three co-sponsored the Medicare for All bill in the House. Had the DCCC not gone so far out of its way to oppose single-payer supporters, the outcome may have been quite different. Had they embraced single-payer, the amount of co-sponsors could have risen considerably.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The problem we have is actually with the Democrats,&rdquo; said Jessica Early, a nurse practitioner and health care justice organizer, in a <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/single-payer-fight-fuels-primary-challengers-against-establishment-democrats/\">2017 interview with <em>Truthout</em></a>. &ldquo;We know how Republicans are going to vote on this issue. The obstacle we face is getting Democrats who will support us into office.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Can New Democrats Derail Single-Payer? </strong></h2>\n<p>The term &ldquo;<a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/hillary-clinton-s-ghosts-a-legacy-of-pushing-the-democratic-party-to-the-right/\">New Democrats</a>&rdquo; refers to an ideological and strategic movement that argues the U.S. is fundamentally a center-right country and the Democrats must embrace this &mdash; and corporate donors &mdash; to win elections. During the 1990s it was the most powerful wing of the party: Bill and Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Joe Lieberman and most of the party&rsquo;s top names were on board. The New Democrats <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030311204313/https:/www.ndol.org/ndol_ci.cfm?kaid=103&subid=111&contentid=251235\">boasted about helping pass the Welfare Reform Act of 1996</a>, which added work requirements to cash and food assistance and was supported mostly by Republicans in Congress. The organization <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/populism-as-an-electoral-strategy-from-howard-dean-to-hillary-clinton/\">was also hostile to candidates</a> who tried to run as progressives, such as Howard Dean and Ned Lamont in 2004 and 2006 respectively.</p>\n<p>This kind of thinking has, for the most part, fallen out of favor: There is virtually no grassroots support for &ldquo;centrist&rdquo; moderation. It is a <a href=\"https://www.pnhp.org/facts/myths_memes.pdf\">doctrinal assumption</a>, however, made by much of the dominant media, that proposals like single-payer will hurt Democrats in the general election, or in districts that President Trump won in 2016. Third Way, which is run largely by hedge fund managers, advanced this theory in its <a href=\"https://www.thirdway.org/memo/winning-on-health-care\">Winning on Health Care</a> memo in 2016.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A national debate over single payer is what Republicans want since it would turn health care from a winning Democratic issue into a losing one,&rdquo; Third Way pleaded.</p>\n<p>Many advocates, however, say a national debate over single-payer is exactly what the Democrats &ndash; and the United States more generally &ndash; need to be having.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is a winning issue for the American people and for the Democrats,&rdquo; Gaffney said. &ldquo;Now we have to get it done.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside><a href=\"https://truthout.org/donate\"> <p>As attacks on women&rsquo;s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we&rsquo;re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever. </p> <p>At Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship. <b>But this is only sustainable if we have your support.</b> If you like what you&rsquo;re reading or just value what we do, will you take a few seconds to contribute to our work? </p>  Donate Now </a></aside>",

                "text": "The Democratic establishment \u2014 deep in the pockets of the health industry \u2014 wanted to make sure any blue wave election in 2018 would help sink, rather than support, the growing movement for a single-payer health care system. The recent decline in co-sponsors of the House Medicare for All legislation is, in part, a byproduct of this strategy and a reminder of the great obstacles corporate Democrats have put in front of the single-payer movement.\nIn 2018, there were 124 cosponsors for the Medicare for All bill in the House (then H.R. 676), representing 66 percent of the Democratic Caucus. This was celebrated widely as a high-water mark for the legislation. So was the release of Bernie Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All bill in the Senate, which also got a record 16 co-sponsors, including prominent Democrats who are running for president.\nGiven that the Democrats gained 35 seats in the 2018 midterm and Medicare for All has been polling extremely high among Democratic voters \u2014 a survey by Reuters from August 2018 showed around 85 percent of Democrats supported the policy \u2014 many were hopeful that the number of cosponsors would rise even higher in the current Congress.\nThe stories you care about, right at your fingertips\nGet Truthout\u2019s daily edition delivered to your inbox.\nDespite this hope, when Rep. Pramila Jayapal introduced the new flagship Medicare for All bill (H.R. 1384), the amount of co-sponsors decreased considerably to 106, down to 47 percent of the caucus. So why, if Democratic voters are moving left on health care, is this not reflected in Congress? Where did all the co-sponsors go?\nA Truthout analysis shows the primary reasons for this decline are: 1) incumbents who once supported Medicare for All who have defected, and 2) a largely disappointing freshman class.\nThe most well-known faces of the freshman class are progressives, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, thanks to their ambitious proposals and popular support. This might give the impression to the public that this is reflective of the whole class. The majority of the newest House Democrats, however, were shaped strongly by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the New Democratic Coalition. About 71 percent (42 of 59) of freshman House members declined to co-sponsor the legislation. Some freshman candidates who ran on the issue during the campaign, like Harley Rouda of California, still declined to co-sponsor Jayapal\u2019s bill.\nIn happier news for the movement, three incumbent Democrats decided to co-sponsor Medicare for All for the first time: Reps. Joseph Kennedy and William Keating of Massachusetts, and Susan Wild of Pennsylvania. However, 29 of the Democrats who were previously co-sponsors have defected this year. Why are Medicare for All\u2019s congressional supporters backing out?\nIncumbent Democrats Turning Away\nIt is much less courageous for members of Congress to co-sponsor legislation that has no chance of passing. So last year, as members of Congress quickly signed on to H.R. 676 some suspicious names appeared on the list (like Joseph Crowley, who had never hinted at support for the policy until he faced Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the primary). In the minority, they could add their names while, behind closed doors, giving viable explanations to donors: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it has no chance of passing \u2014 I am just getting re-elected.\u201d\nNow that Democrats control the House, this calculus changes for many. Sure enough, 29 incumbents who previously co-sponsored H.R. 676 have failed to co-sponsor the newer bill, which recently was made stronger to include long-term care for elderly and disabled Americans. Among these defectors are Reps. Elijah Cummings, Hakeem Jeffries and Marcy Kaptur.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another painful but important lesson about the limits of politely pushing elected officials to the left,\u201d writes Alex Panagiotopoulos, who analyzed the defections. \u201cJust because they co-sponsor or promise to support legislation doesn\u2019t mean [they will] expend any political capital to make it happen.\u201d\nAdam Gaffney, president of Physicians for a National Health Program, told Truthout that the most important thing is to keep pressuring candidates to support the legislation.\n\u201cThe movement has been putting pressure on Democrats [that] don\u2019t support it, this kind of work must continue,\u201d he said. (Gaffney recently impressed many with his stirring defense of Medicare for All on Fox Business News.)\nWhy the Freshman Class Is Largely Unsupportive of Single-Payer\nWhen people think of the freshman class of Democrats, the most recognizable names tend to be Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. This makes sense, as they are pushing popular policies \u2014 and are constantly attacked by Republicans.\nThese strong voices of dissent, however, are in the minority in the new Congress. By and large, the freshman class of House Democrats has refused to support single-payer in practice. Of the 59 freshman Democrats elected to Congress this year, only 17 of them (a woeful 29 percent) co-sponsored H.R. 1834.\nThis was not by chance. It can be traced to the Democratic National Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the corporatist New Democratic Coalition in the House (and its affiliated NewDemPAC). Long before the 2018 midterms were underway, Democratic Party power brokers and fundraisers were militant in trying to keep prospective members of Congress in line going into the 2018 election. This included pleading with new candidates not to support single-payer or, as The Intercept reported with corroborating audio, trying to bully progressives out of the races altogether, depriving voters of a chance to weigh in. Establishment Democrats\u2019 goal was, as Politico reported, to \u201cneutralize the threat\u201d of single-payer.\n\u201cDemocratic voters want single payer health care. But don\u2019t expect to hear Democratic candidates talk about it,\u201d the report said. \u201cTo avoid divisive intraparty fights that drive candidates left \u2014 only to be attacked by Republicans for favoring socialized medicine \u2014 the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee warned aspirants last year about the political liabilities of endorsing \u2018single-payer.\u2019\u201d\nUntil the Bernie Sanders campaign in 2016, single-payer was not recognized by most media and politicians as a mainstream proposal (despite its popularity among the public). Sanders energized the movement, putting powerful Democrats and industry stakeholders on guard.\nSurely, the leadership of the New Democratic Coalition and similarly minded organizations chalk this up to another victory for the \u201cvital center.\u201d They, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, argue the voters aren\u2019t \u201cready\u201d for single-payer, despite its massive popularity. This is a rather dubious interpretation, however, given that the DCCC deprived many voters of a chance to vote for a single-payer candidate in their district. Candidates were hand-picked by party officials in many instances, as the Hoyer tape proved.\nWhen seeking candidates in 2018, the DCCC embraced the centrist/corporate Third Way agenda. The New Democratic Coalition, which preaches free markets and is funded largely by Wall Street, endorsed 27 candidates in the 2018 primary. The DCCC, the primary fundraising institution for the House, endorsed 25 of these 27 candidates via its Red to Blue list. This provided money, support, opposition research and more, giving these candidates a huge advantage in the primaries. As a result, candidates supporting single-payer found themselves being thwarted, attacked and outspent by their own party leaders, who were defying the wishes of most of their base.\n\u201cThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee unleashed a scorched-earth campaign against [House candidate Laura Moser of Texas],\u201d reported Vox, \u201creleasing an opposition memo highlighting past statements Moser made seemingly denigrating her home state.\u201d\nMoser, a single-payer supporter, lost to the DCCC\u2019s choice, Lizzy Fletcher, in the primary. Fletcher won the seat and failed to co-sponsor the new Medicare for All bill.\nBy contrast, the DCCC did not support any of the same House candidates endorsed by the Bernie Sanders-founded organization, Our Revolution, which endorses candidates with a range of progressive views on single-payer and beyond.\nThe New Democratic Coalition saw 16 of its endorsed candidates win in 2018. Of these 16 candidates, only three co-sponsored the Medicare for All bill in the House. Had the DCCC not gone so far out of its way to oppose single-payer supporters, the outcome may have been quite different. Had they embraced single-payer, the amount of co-sponsors could have risen considerably.\n\u201cThe problem we have is actually with the Democrats,\u201d said Jessica Early, a nurse practitioner and health care justice organizer, in a 2017 interview with Truthout. \u201cWe know how Republicans are going to vote on this issue. The obstacle we face is getting Democrats who will support us into office.\u201d\nCan New Democrats Derail Single-Payer?\nThe term \u201cNew Democrats\u201d refers to an ideological and strategic movement that argues the U.S. is fundamentally a center-right country and the Democrats must embrace this \u2014 and corporate donors \u2014 to win elections. During the 1990s it was the most powerful wing of the party: Bill and Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Joe Lieberman and most of the party\u2019s top names were on board. The New Democrats boasted about helping pass the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, which added work requirements to cash and food assistance and was supported mostly by Republicans in Congress. The organization was also hostile to candidates who tried to run as progressives, such as Howard Dean and Ned Lamont in 2004 and 2006 respectively.\nThis kind of thinking has, for the most part, fallen out of favor: There is virtually no grassroots support for \u201ccentrist\u201d moderation. It is a doctrinal assumption, however, made by much of the dominant media, that proposals like single-payer will hurt Democrats in the general election, or in districts that President Trump won in 2016. Third Way, which is run largely by hedge fund managers, advanced this theory in its Winning on Health Care memo in 2016.\n\u201cA national debate over single payer is what Republicans want since it would turn health care from a winning Democratic issue into a losing one,\u201d Third Way pleaded.\nMany advocates, however, say a national debate over single-payer is exactly what the Democrats \u2013 and the United States more generally \u2013 need to be having.\n\u201cThis is a winning issue for the American people and for the Democrats,\u201d Gaffney said. \u201cNow we have to get it done.\u201d\nAs attacks on women\u2019s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we\u2019re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever.\nAt Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship.

                "html": "<p>Anyone concerned about probable carcinogens in the environment needs to keep an eye on the trial of <em>Edward Hardeman v. Monsanto Company</em>, which begins on February 25, in the Federal District Court in San Francisco. A bellwether for future challenges against the company, the federal court has grouped hundreds of plaintiffs into this multidistrict litigation case. The plaintiffs have sued Monsanto claiming to have contracted non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma (NHL) after being exposed to Roundup, the company&rsquo;s glyphosate-based herbicide. While there are an <a href=\"https://www.consumersafety.org/legal/roundup-lawsuit/\">estimated 9,300 lawsuits</a> against the chemical giant because of Roundup, <em>Hardeman</em> will be only the second NHL trial against Monsanto ever.</p>\n<p>Judge Vince Chhabria has already <a href=\"https://www.law.com/therecorder/2019/01/04/chhabria-blesses-monsantos-move-to-bifurcate-upcoming-roundup-trials/\">granted an unusual motion</a> by Monsanto to split the <em>Hardeman</em> trial into two phases. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/bayer-glyphosate/plaintiffs-in-monsanto-roundup-mdl-call-trial-bifurcation-unheard-of-idUSL1N1YM1QV\">Characterized as &ldquo;unheard of&rdquo;</a> by the plaintiffs, this way of trying a case is called bifurcation, consisting of a first phase that would have the jury determine if there is a preponderance of scientific evidence that Roundup caused Hardeman&rsquo;s cancer. If the jury finds this to be true, they will then be allowed to decide if Monsanto knew of and attempted to hide the dangers of Roundup. To do this, they will be shown internal Monsanto documents that reveal how the company ignored or tried to discredit legitimate science and scientists, ghostwrote scientific studies and manipulated regulators. (I saw this evidence firsthand, because I was a juror on the first ever NHL trial, <em>Dwayne Lee Johnson v. Monsanto</em>.)</p>\n<p>Monsanto&rsquo;s attorneys asked the judge to bifurcate the upcoming trial because they think that<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-monsanto-cancer-lawsuit-analysis/monsanto-roundup-appeal-has-uphill-climb-on-junk-science-grounds-legal-experts-idUSKBN1KZ2EW\"> jurors will be swayed by the emotions</a> brought forth from seeing the documents exposing systematic corporate malfeasance. This is not the first time Monsanto has inferred that a jury might, or might have, reached a verdict based on emotions.</p>\n<aside><h2>Uncompromised, uncompromising news</h2> <p>Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.</p>  </aside>\n<p>After the historic $289 million award to the plaintiff in <em>Dwayne Lee Johnson v. Monsanto</em> on August 10, 2018, defense attorneys asked Superior Court Judge Suzanne Bolanos to toss the jury&rsquo;s nearly unanimous verdict claiming, in part, that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-monsanto-cancer-lawsuit-analysis/monsanto-roundup-appeal-has-uphill-climb-on-junk-science-grounds-legal-experts-idUSKBN1KZ2EW\">they were &ldquo;inflamed&rdquo;</a> by some of the rhetoric in the plaintiff&rsquo;s closing argument.</p>\n<p>Regardless, it is astonishing that Monsanto would ask to bifurcate the trial. This is tantamount to admitting that, yes, there is evidence of despicable behavior by managing agents of the company. Monsanto has good reason to keep this evidence from a jury, because it is certainly damning. In the <em>Johnson</em> trial, Monsanto objected to multiple attempts by the plaintiff to admit evidence. The <a href=\"https://glyphosategirl.com/?p=435\">plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel was incredulous</a> when Judge Bolanos would not allow any mention of California&rsquo;s Proposition 65, under which Californians are warned that Roundup is a probable carcinogen.</p>\n<p>Judge Chhabria is apparently realizing the mess he created by granting the bifurcation. On <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-judge-allow-controversial-evidence-023818489.html\">January 28, he backtracked</a> and decided to allow some evidence of Monsanto&rsquo;s alleged nefarious <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-judge-allow-controversial-evidence-023818489.html\">manipulation of scientists and regulators</a>. Monsanto is now pointing to the <em>Hardeman</em> bifurcation to convince a Superior Court judge in Oakland, California, to bifurcate <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/sick-couple-push-to-fast-track-roundup-cancer-trial/\">a similar lawsuit</a><u><a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/sick-couple-push-to-fast-track-roundup-cancer-trial/\">,</a></u> <em>Pilliod v. Monsanto</em>. Attempts to control juries should not be allowed to become the norm simply because a large corporation is fighting for its financial life, especially when thousands of people exposed to Roundup are fighting for their <em>actual</em> lives.</p>\n<p>Monsanto, which was acquired by Bayer in June 2018 for more than $60 billion, has taken a <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-11-19/bayer-faces-billion-dollar-losses-related-legal-claims-deadly-roundup-herbicide\">financial hit</a> since the <em>Johnson</em> verdict in August. That kind of money, or the loss of it, exerts influence &mdash; think corporate lobbyists. But <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5044953/\">billions of pounds of Roundup</a> have been sprayed on farms, next to roadways, in public parks, in lakes, in forests and around residences over the last 40 years. The use of the herbicide continued even after it was classified as a probable carcinogen by the World Health Organization in March 2015. These facts should push back against that influence.</p>\n<p>It is fair to wonder what we can do to see that justice is served. There are no easy answers, but it is worth noting that after the judge in the <em>Johnson</em> case made a tentative ruling to toss that nearly unanimous verdict, several former jurors for the trial (including me) were so outraged that they <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Monsanto-case-Jurors-urge-judge-not-to-overturn-13309317.php\">publicly called Judge Bolanos out. </a>To her credit, she backed off and upheld the verdict, albeit <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Judge-drastically-reduces-punitive-damages-in-13327991.php\">reducing the payout to Johnson to $78 million</a><a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Judge-drastically-reduces-punitive-damages-in-13327991.php\">.</a></p>\n<p>Those former jurors were, in fact, just regular citizens who decided their civic duty extended beyond the end of the trial and included protecting their verdict. In California, Superior Court judges can be recalled when the electorate is aggrieved. With federal judges, our only recourse may be to elect a president who we believe would make the kinds of judicial appointments we want, but however we do it, we have a constitutional right to free speech, and the ballot, to hold the judiciary accountable. The bottom line is that juries should be allowed to see all the evidence in these cases without interference by judges.

                "text": "Anyone concerned about probable carcinogens in the environment needs to keep an eye on the trial of Edward Hardeman v. Monsanto Company, which begins on February 25, in the Federal District Court in San Francisco. A bellwether for future challenges against the company, the federal court has grouped hundreds of plaintiffs into this multidistrict litigation case. The plaintiffs have sued Monsanto claiming to have contracted non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) after being exposed to Roundup, the company\u2019s glyphosate-based herbicide. While there are an estimated 9,300 lawsuits against the chemical giant because of Roundup, Hardeman will be only the second NHL trial against Monsanto ever.\nJudge Vince Chhabria has already granted an unusual motion by Monsanto to split the Hardeman trial into two phases. Characterized as \u201cunheard of\u201d by the plaintiffs, this way of trying a case is called bifurcation, consisting of a first phase that would have the jury determine if there is a preponderance of scientific evidence that Roundup caused Hardeman\u2019s cancer. If the jury finds this to be true, they will then be allowed to decide if Monsanto knew of and attempted to hide the dangers of Roundup. To do this, they will be shown internal Monsanto documents that reveal how the company ignored or tried to discredit legitimate science and scientists, ghostwrote scientific studies and manipulated regulators. (I saw this evidence firsthand, because I was a juror on the first ever NHL trial, Dwayne Lee Johnson v. Monsanto.)\nMonsanto\u2019s attorneys asked the judge to bifurcate the upcoming trial because they think that jurors will be swayed by the emotions brought forth from seeing the documents exposing systematic corporate malfeasance. This is not the first time Monsanto has inferred that a jury might, or might have, reached a verdict based on emotions.\nUncompromised, uncompromising news\nGet reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.\nAfter the historic $289 million award to the plaintiff in Dwayne Lee Johnson v. Monsanto on August 10, 2018, defense attorneys asked Superior Court Judge Suzanne Bolanos to toss the jury\u2019s nearly unanimous verdict claiming, in part, that they were \u201cinflamed\u201d by some of the rhetoric in the plaintiff\u2019s closing argument.\nRegardless, it is astonishing that Monsanto would ask to bifurcate the trial. This is tantamount to admitting that, yes, there is evidence of despicable behavior by managing agents of the company. Monsanto has good reason to keep this evidence from a jury, because it is certainly damning. In the Johnson trial, Monsanto objected to multiple attempts by the plaintiff to admit evidence. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel was incredulous when Judge Bolanos would not allow any mention of California\u2019s Proposition 65, under which Californians are warned that Roundup is a probable carcinogen.\nJudge Chhabria is apparently realizing the mess he created by granting the bifurcation. On January 28, he backtracked and decided to allow some evidence of Monsanto\u2019s alleged nefarious manipulation of scientists and regulators. Monsanto is now pointing to the Hardeman bifurcation to convince a Superior Court judge in Oakland, California, to bifurcate a similar lawsuit, Pilliod v. Monsanto. Attempts to control juries should not be allowed to become the norm simply because a large corporation is fighting for its financial life, especially when thousands of people exposed to Roundup are fighting for their actual lives.\nMonsanto, which was acquired by Bayer in June 2018 for more than $60 billion, has taken a financial hit since the Johnson verdict in August. That kind of money, or the loss of it, exerts influence \u2014 think corporate lobbyists. But billions of pounds of Roundup have been sprayed on farms, next to roadways, in public parks, in lakes, in forests and around residences over the last 40 years. The use of the herbicide continued even after it was classified as a probable carcinogen by the World Health Organization in March 2015. These facts should push back against that influence.\nIt is fair to wonder what we can do to see that justice is served. There are no easy answers, but it is worth noting that after the judge in the Johnson case made a tentative ruling to toss that nearly unanimous verdict, several former jurors for the trial (including me) were so outraged that they publicly called Judge Bolanos out. To her credit, she backed off and upheld the verdict, albeit reducing the payout to Johnson to $78 million.\nThose former jurors were, in fact, just regular citizens who decided their civic duty extended beyond the end of the trial and included protecting their verdict. In California, Superior Court judges can be recalled when the electorate is aggrieved. With federal judges, our only recourse may be to elect a president who we believe would make the kinds of judicial appointments we want, but however we do it, we have a constitutional right to free speech, and the ballot, to hold the judiciary accountable. The bottom line is that juries should be allowed to see all the evidence in these cases without interference by judges. With proper instructions from a judge, a jury is uniquely suited to weigh the evidence without passion or prejudice and is, ultimately, very difficult to fool.\nThe stakes have never been higher\nAs attacks on women\u2019s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we\u2019re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever.\nAt Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship.

                "html": "<p>In ancient, pre-Christian Nordic myths, the Oskorei is a collection of souls that jets through the night sky above the living, often with the god Odin leading the horde. On certain occasions, the Oskorei may swoop down to grapple with the living, faces adorned in white with black rims. Over the course of the 20th century, a pagan revival took over, recharging these myths with new eyes, reinterpreting them through the lens of modernity and ascribing them metaphysical significance.</p>\n<p>While it happened throughout Europe and the U.S., it was particularly strong among the v&ouml;lkisch movements in Germany that were trying to wrestle with identity around a newly formed nation and a reaction from the countryside to the homogenizing influence of urban life and advancing industrial technology.</p>\n<p>Heathenry, the pagan religions of Germany and Nordic regions, was imbued with a new significance not possible before the modern concept of race took hold. Through this, the Germanic gods were seen as archetypes for the genetic kin of Northern Europe, and monstrosities like the rise of the Third Reich were a certain Odinic spirit taking over the psyche of its people.</p>\n<aside><h2>The stories you care about, right at your fingertips</h2> <p>Get Truthout&rsquo;s daily edition delivered to your inbox.</p>  </aside>\n<p>It is with this angle in mind that Michael Moynihan and co-author Didrik S&oslash;derlind revisited the Oskorei in their 1998 opus <em>Lords of Chaos</em>, which told of the scattered birth of Norwegian black metal and the murders and church arsons it left behind. The book set the tone for how the U.S. imported black metal, the primary market for its albums, retelling its story as one of pure extremity &mdash; brutal and offensive, iconoclastic and dangerous.</p>\n<p>For two decades, <em>Lords of Chaos</em> has remained the go-to text for how the black metal movement began. The black metal scene often wins its scores by outdoing itself in terms of outrageousness, blending all things taboo into pure hyperbole. It is within this framework, where real-life horrors only add to its branding, that Moynihan took the most painful parts of black metal&rsquo;s history and made it a selling point.</p>\n<p>It was the book&rsquo;s pedigree that led to it finally being adapted into a fairly major Hollywood release from Arrow Films with critical support from Vice Films, capped with stars like Rory Culkin to prop up its focus on the violence of the Norwegian scene centered on the band Mayhem. Just like the book, the movie takes some of the most extreme characters, their murders and suicides, and turns it into horror fodder, acceptably scary because it is so extreme.</p>\n<p>The question that should be asked about the <em>Lords of Chaos</em> film adaptation is not whether the story should be told; the story is, without a doubt, dramatic and poignant. Instead, we should ask why someone like Moynihan, whose history in white nationalism and fascist politics traces several decades, is at the center of it. In an era where <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/is-donald-trump-carrying-out-the-white-nationalism-of-an-alt-right-presidency/\">white nationalist violence</a> is at a record high, why did major studios decide to purchase the option to a book filled with fascist occultism from a man who never hid his own fascism?</p>\n<h2>&ldquo;The Strong Rule the Weak, and the Clever Rule the Strong&rdquo;</h2>\n<p>Moynihan is best known for <em>Lords of Chaos</em>, largely because it was the first book with insider access to the black metal scene, but his own history is even more checkered. Always on the edge of extreme music and occult philosophy, he was known for a &ldquo;will to power&rdquo; type of fascist politics that is explicit in much of his writing.</p>\n<p>He is the front man for the neo-folk band Blood Axis, known for combining v&ouml;lkisch paganism and the fascist traditionalism of philosophers like Julius Evola. The neo-folk scene has been mired in controversy for the last 15 years since there is a central theme of reimagining Europe&rsquo;s past in romantic terms, often focusing on occultism and the celebration of empire. This is a trend in far-right art that is often termed &ldquo;metapolitics,&rdquo; an effort to sneak in fascist ideas in ways that are not strictly political.</p>\n<p>Instead, the artists will try to echo fascist themes through art and culture, changing the way the subculture thinks and thereby shifting the values of that culture to fit their vision. Moynihan was at the center of this project, both as a musician and journalist, propping up many of the bands that became influential at repackaging far-right themes in their music.</p>\n<p><em>Lords of Chaos,</em> both the book and the film adaptation, focuses heavily on Varg Vikernes, who fronts the industrial music project Burzum and served 15 years in prison for burning churches and the murder of &Oslash;ystein Aarseth of Mayhem. While Vikernes would be a likely villain for a book like this, he is instead portrayed as a charming oddity, an eccentric whose own ideas lead huge portions of the book&rsquo;s philosophical musings. Vikernes himself is a white nationalist who sees a need to return to the ancestral religions of Norway, to remove the Judeo-Christian influences and reinvigorate a warrior culture.</p>\n<p>Together, Vikernes and Moynihan discuss the black metal scene as the Nordic people channeling their Oskorei nature, a part of the Nordic spiritual psyche waiting to be reawakened. Reacting to the spoils of Christian capitalist consumerism, the children of this generation embodied total nihilism, wanting for death and violence expressed in frenzy. This is in line with what evolved to be known as &ldquo;folkish&rdquo; paganism, the idea that the gods of a particular culture&rsquo;s past are psychically bound to them, racially prescribed.</p>\n<p>It is through this lens that Vikernes attempted to justify his church burnings as acts against the &ldquo;invaders,&rdquo; both worshiping a foreign Jewish god and representing a degenerate &ldquo;slave morality,&rdquo; which celebrates the virtue of the commoner rather than the oppressor stamping out rebellion from a position of utter strength. He railed about the weaknesses of Christianity, and about cleansing the land to re-establish a Viking morality that would sanctify will, power, cruelty and hierarchy.</p>\n<p>This line resonates strongly with Moynihan, who referred to himself as a fascist in the 1990s. He worked closely with the enigmatic far-right artist Boyd Rice, a similar experimental industrial musician, on the Abraxas Project that was designed to propel &ldquo;social Darwinist&rdquo; ideas. The tagline of the organization was: &ldquo;The strong rule the weak, and the clever rule the strong,&rdquo; echoing their own Nietzschean brand of domination theology.</p>\n<h2>Blood on His Hands</h2>\n<p>Moynihan loved to raise up the voices of the absolute fringes, which led him to James Mason. Mason joined the American Nazi Party&rsquo;s youth division in 1966, and when he turned 18 in 1970, he became an adult member. By then, it had been renamed the National Socialist White People&rsquo;s Party. He eventually saw the group&rsquo;s activism as stale and wanted to co-opt leftist strategies of guerrilla warfare he was seeing in liberation movements in the Global South. Thus, Mason argued for using shocking violence as a tactic to disrupt the order of society and create fractures that could be used to build the kind of national socialism Hitler imagined.</p>\n<p>He joined the National Socialist Liberation Front in 1976, whose publication was <i>Siege,</i>which he revived and became the editor of in 1980. Since his publication rarely hit more than 75 monthly subscribers, it would have disappeared from the white nationalist audience entirely, yet Moynihan saw something there. He collected the newsletters and edited them into a book, which grew a cult following among neo-Nazis because of its extreme calls for urban terrorism and its support for Charles Manson and the use of cultish murderers as praxis. <em>Siege</em> later became the inspiration for the U.S.-based Atomwaffen Division, a series of neo-Nazi terror cells that have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/06/590292705/5-killings-3-states-and-1-common-neo-nazi-link\">murdered at least five people in the last two years</a> as the group found a new home at the corners of the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/the-alt-right-is-building-a-white-nationalist-mass-movement-with-operation-homeland/\">a</a><a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/the-alt-right-is-building-a-white-nationalist-mass-movement-with-operation-homeland/\">lt</a><a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/the-alt-right-is-building-a-white-nationalist-mass-movement-with-operation-homeland/\">&ndash;</a><a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/the-alt-right-is-building-a-white-nationalist-mass-movement-with-operation-homeland/\">r</a><a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/the-alt-right-is-building-a-white-nationalist-mass-movement-with-operation-homeland/\">ight</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Moynihan introduced pro-genocide, pro-serial killer neo-Nazism to tens of thousands of people,&rdquo; said Spencer Sunshine, an associate fellow at Political Research Associates, who researches fascist subcultures. &ldquo;He has blood on his hands.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What Moynihan did later in his career is a familiar pattern for white nationalists looking to embed their ideas more thoroughly with intellectual credibility. He started the heathen journal <em>Runa</em> to mix in folkish perspectives on folklore and literature with more mainstream ones, often republishing dead authors like Michael Cunningham or essays on J.R.R. Tolkien to give the ideas broader appeal.</p>\n<p>Moynihan founded the journal <em>Tyr</em>, which helped to popularize &ldquo;radical traditionalism&rdquo; as a philosophical idea. Building on fascist metaphysical authors like Julius Evola, radical traditionalism argues that there are underlying hierarchies and spiritual pathways to all of society, and that we must return to pre-modern ways of living, which followers see as stratified along lines of class, race, gender and so on.</p>\n<p><em>Tyr</em> worked hard to mix white nationalists like Collin Cleary, known for his books on white nationalist interpretations of Norse paganism, with legitimate scholars on ancient art, religion, politics and culture &mdash; mixing a cocktail of academic prose to make the racialist and totalitarian themes seem more palatable. Moynihan has gone on to edit a reprint of a book by Evola, as well as edit books by a range of folkish authors, oftentimes getting them published in more mainstream occult presses without objection.</p>\n<h2>Performance Art</h2>\n<p>While Moynihan&rsquo;s ideas have always been pretty clearly stated, his work is often dismissed as an act. Instead of seeing him as entirely sincere, Moynihan is often discussed as an intentionally provocative antagonist rather than an evangelist.</p>\n<p>His relationship with Mason is reduced to his obsession with those on the edges, rather than a commitment to ideology. This is, to a degree, the mentality applied to black metal, where we may not agree with some ideas, but it is their extreme nature that makes them attractive, if only in a kitsch way. This requires certain rhetorical gymnastics, since Moynihan has been one of the centers of the pseudo-intellectualism inside the U.S. far right, which desperately hopes to create an ideological center that looks like more than simple bigotry.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Moynihan is definitely proto-&lsquo;alt-right&rsquo; in that he was one of the first people to champion a more &lsquo;intellectual&rsquo; version of white nationalism,&rdquo; Sunshine told Truthout.</p>\n<p>Jonas &Aring;kerlund, the director of the film adaptation of <em>Lords of Chaos</em>, knows better than anyone who Moynihan is since &Aring;kerlund himself comes from the world of Norwegian black metal. Though he is best known for his film school takes on Madonna songs, he was also a member of the Swedish black metal band Bathory in the 1980s, which is likely why he was channeled into this project. <em>Vice</em> has covered the far-right areas of <a href=\"https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/mbbg9p/a-brief-but-very-informative-history-of-how-fascists-infiltrated-punk-and-metal\">National Socialist black metal</a> thoroughly as well, and so there is little question as to why this book was chosen as the source for a major film that Vice Films supported so heavily. Vikernes, for his part, has attacked the movie virulently, accusing Jews of spreading lies about him.</p>\n<p>The book itself has little narrative thrust to it, largely made up of philosophical diatribes and band interviews, and so the screenplay likely had to be drawn from a range of sources. This means that while the production company likely cut Moynihan a sizeable check for the rights to the book, they didn&rsquo;t have to. Instead, they chose to only because of the name recognition for the title, and possibly, because of the edgy reputation it brought along. Instead of seeing the violent white nationalism openly professed in the book as a liability, they may have cynically hoped it would help them cash a check.</p>\n<p>There is undeniably something important in the way that the black metal scene formed, what it says about alienation, and the negotiation between consumer capitalism and identity, but there is no reason that history has to be defined by self-described fascists like Moynihan. The story of black metal has multiple centers, bands repudiating the right, defining themselves on the left, and the families and communities torn apart from white nationalists posing as nihilistic artists. Instead of telling the same old mythology about extreme music, the producers could have given the story three dimensions. And they could have saved the money they sent to a white nationalist.</p>\n<aside><a href=\"https://truthout.org/donate\"> <p>As attacks on women&rsquo;s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we&rsquo;re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever. </p> <p>At Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship. <b>But this is only sustainable if we have your support.</b> If you like what you&rsquo;re reading or just value what we do, will you take a few seconds to contribute to our work? </p>  Donate Now </a></aside>",

                "text": "In ancient, pre-Christian Nordic myths, the Oskorei is a collection of souls that jets through the night sky above the living, often with the god Odin leading the horde. On certain occasions, the Oskorei may swoop down to grapple with the living, faces adorned in white with black rims. Over the course of the 20th century, a pagan revival took over, recharging these myths with new eyes, reinterpreting them through the lens of modernity and ascribing them metaphysical significance.\nWhile it happened throughout Europe and the U.S., it was particularly strong among the v\u00f6lkisch movements in Germany that were trying to wrestle with identity around a newly formed nation and a reaction from the countryside to the homogenizing influence of urban life and advancing industrial technology.\nHeathenry, the pagan religions of Germany and Nordic regions, was imbued with a new significance not possible before the modern concept of race took hold. Through this, the Germanic gods were seen as archetypes for the genetic kin of Northern Europe, and monstrosities like the rise of the Third Reich were a certain Odinic spirit taking over the psyche of its people.\nThe stories you care about, right at your fingertips\nGet Truthout\u2019s daily edition delivered to your inbox.\nIt is with this angle in mind that Michael Moynihan and co-author Didrik S\u00f8derlind revisited the Oskorei in their 1998 opus Lords of Chaos, which told of the scattered birth of Norwegian black metal and the murders and church arsons it left behind. The book set the tone for how the U.S. imported black metal, the primary market for its albums, retelling its story as one of pure extremity \u2014 brutal and offensive, iconoclastic and dangerous.\nFor two decades, Lords of Chaos has remained the go-to text for how the black metal movement began. The black metal scene often wins its scores by outdoing itself in terms of outrageousness, blending all things taboo into pure hyperbole. It is within this framework, where real-life horrors only add to its branding, that Moynihan took the most painful parts of black metal\u2019s history and made it a selling point.\nIt was the book\u2019s pedigree that led to it finally being adapted into a fairly major Hollywood release from Arrow Films with critical support from Vice Films, capped with stars like Rory Culkin to prop up its focus on the violence of the Norwegian scene centered on the band Mayhem. Just like the book, the movie takes some of the most extreme characters, their murders and suicides, and turns it into horror fodder, acceptably scary because it is so extreme.\nThe question that should be asked about the Lords of Chaos film adaptation is not whether the story should be told; the story is, without a doubt, dramatic and poignant. Instead, we should ask why someone like Moynihan, whose history in white nationalism and fascist politics traces several decades, is at the center of it. In an era where white nationalist violence is at a record high, why did major studios decide to purchase the option to a book filled with fascist occultism from a man who never hid his own fascism?\n\u201cThe Strong Rule the Weak, and the Clever Rule the Strong\u201d\nMoynihan is best known for Lords of Chaos, largely because it was the first book with insider access to the black metal scene, but his own history is even more checkered. Always on the edge of extreme music and occult philosophy, he was known for a \u201cwill to power\u201d type of fascist politics that is explicit in much of his writing.\nHe is the front man for the neo-folk band Blood Axis, known for combining v\u00f6lkisch paganism and the fascist traditionalism of philosophers like Julius Evola. The neo-folk scene has been mired in controversy for the last 15 years since there is a central theme of reimagining Europe\u2019s past in romantic terms, often focusing on occultism and the celebration of empire. This is a trend in far-right art that is often termed \u201cmetapolitics,\u201d an effort to sneak in fascist ideas in ways that are not strictly political.\nInstead, the artists will try to echo fascist themes through art and culture, changing the way the subculture thinks and thereby shifting the values of that culture to fit their vision. Moynihan was at the center of this project, both as a musician and journalist, propping up many of the bands that became influential at repackaging far-right themes in their music.\nLords of Chaos, both the book and the film adaptation, focuses heavily on Varg Vikernes, who fronts the industrial music project Burzum and served 15 years in prison for burning churches and the murder of \u00d8ystein Aarseth of Mayhem. While Vikernes would be a likely villain for a book like this, he is instead portrayed as a charming oddity, an eccentric whose own ideas lead huge portions of the book\u2019s philosophical musings. Vikernes himself is a white nationalist who sees a need to return to the ancestral religions of Norway, to remove the Judeo-Christian influences and reinvigorate a warrior culture.\nTogether, Vikernes and Moynihan discuss the black metal scene as the Nordic people channeling their Oskorei nature, a part of the Nordic spiritual psyche waiting to be reawakened. Reacting to the spoils of Christian capitalist consumerism, the children of this generation embodied total nihilism, wanting for death and violence expressed in frenzy. This is in line with what evolved to be known as \u201cfolkish\u201d paganism, the idea that the gods of a particular culture\u2019s past are psychically bound to them, racially prescribed.\nIt is through this lens that Vikernes attempted to justify his church burnings as acts against the \u201cinvaders,\u201d both worshiping a foreign Jewish god and representing a degenerate \u201cslave morality,\u201d which celebrates the virtue of the commoner rather than the oppressor stamping out rebellion from a position of utter strength. He railed about the weaknesses of Christianity, and about cleansing the land to re-establish a Viking morality that would sanctify will, power, cruelty and hierarchy.\nThis line resonates strongly with Moynihan, who referred to himself as a fascist in the 1990s. He worked closely with the enigmatic far-right artist Boyd Rice, a similar experimental industrial musician, on the Abraxas Project that was designed to propel \u201csocial Darwinist\u201d ideas. The tagline of the organization was: \u201cThe strong rule the weak, and the clever rule the strong,\u201d echoing their own Nietzschean brand of domination theology.\nBlood on His Hands\nMoynihan loved to raise up the voices of the absolute fringes, which led him to James Mason. Mason joined the American Nazi Party\u2019s youth division in 1966, and when he turned 18 in 1970, he became an adult member. By then, it had been renamed the National Socialist White People\u2019s Party. He eventually saw the group\u2019s activism as stale and wanted to co-opt leftist strategies of guerrilla warfare he was seeing in liberation movements in the Global South. Thus, Mason argued for using shocking violence as a tactic to disrupt the order of society and create fractures that could be used to build the kind of national socialism Hitler imagined.\nHe joined the National Socialist Liberation Front in 1976, whose publication was Siege, which he revived and became the editor of in 1980. Since his publication rarely hit more than 75 monthly subscribers, it would have disappeared from the white nationalist audience entirely, yet Moynihan saw something there. He collected the newsletters and edited them into a book, which grew a cult following among neo-Nazis because of its extreme calls for urban terrorism and its support for Charles Manson and the use of cultish murderers as praxis. Siege later became the inspiration for the U.S.-based Atomwaffen Division, a series of neo-Nazi terror cells that have murdered at least five people in the last two years as the group found a new home at the corners of the \u201calt\u2013right.\u201d\n\u201cMoynihan introduced pro-genocide, pro-serial killer neo-Nazism to tens of thousands of people,\u201d said Spencer Sunshine, an associate fellow at Political Research Associates, who researches fascist subcultures. \u201cHe has blood on his hands.\u201d\nWhat Moynihan did later in his career is a familiar pattern for white nationalists looking to embed their ideas more thoroughly with intellectual credibility. He started the heathen journal Runa to mix in folkish perspectives on folklore and literature with more mainstream ones, often republishing dead authors like Michael Cunningham or essays on J.R.R. Tolkien to give the ideas broader appeal.\nMoynihan founded the journal Tyr, which helped to popularize \u201cradical traditionalism\u201d as a philosophical idea. Building on fascist metaphysical authors like Julius Evola, radical traditionalism argues that there are underlying hierarchies and spiritual pathways to all of society, and that we must return to pre-modern ways of living, which followers see as stratified along lines of class, race, gender and so on.\nTyr worked hard to mix white nationalists like Collin Cleary, known for his books on white nationalist interpretations of Norse paganism, with legitimate scholars on ancient art, religion, politics and culture \u2014 mixing a cocktail of academic prose to make the racialist and totalitarian themes seem more palatable. Moynihan has gone on to edit a reprint of a book by Evola, as well as edit books by a range of folkish authors, oftentimes getting them published in more mainstream occult presses without objection.\nPerformance Art\nWhile Moynihan\u2019s ideas have always been pretty clearly stated, his work is often dismissed as an act. Instead of seeing him as entirely sincere, Moynihan is often discussed as an intentionally provocative antagonist rather than an evangelist.\nHis relationship with Mason is reduced to his obsession with those on the edges, rather than a commitment to ideology. This is, to a degree, the mentality applied to black metal, where we may not agree with some ideas, but it is their extreme nature that makes them attractive, if only in a kitsch way. This requires certain rhetorical gymnastics, since Moynihan has been one of the centers of the pseudo-intellectualism inside the U.S. far right, which desperately hopes to create an ideological center that looks like more than simple bigotry.\n\u201cMoynihan is definitely proto-\u2018alt-right\u2019 in that he was one of the first people to champion a more \u2018intellectual\u2019 version of white nationalism,\u201d Sunshine told Truthout.\nJonas \u00c5kerlund, the director of the film adaptation of Lords of Chaos, knows better than anyone who Moynihan is since \u00c5kerlund himself comes from the world of Norwegian black metal. Though he is best known for his film school takes on Madonna songs, he was also a member of the Swedish black metal band Bathory in the 1980s, which is likely why he was channeled into this project. Vice has covered the far-right areas of National Socialist black metal thoroughly as well, and so there is little question as to why this book was chosen as the source for a major film that Vice Films supported so heavily. Vikernes, for his part, has attacked the movie virulently, accusing Jews of spreading lies about him.\nThe book itself has little narrative thrust to it, largely made up of philosophical diatribes and band interviews, and so the screenplay likely had to be drawn from a range of sources. This means that while the production company likely cut Moynihan a sizeable check for the rights to the book, they didn\u2019t have to. Instead, they chose to only because of the name recognition for the title, and possibly, because of the edgy reputation it brought along. Instead of seeing the violent white nationalism openly professed in the book as a liability, they may have cynically hoped it would help them cash a check.\nThere is undeniably something important in the way that the black metal scene formed, what it says about alienation, and the negotiation between consumer capitalism and identity, but there is no reason that history has to be defined by self-described fascists like Moynihan. The story of black metal has multiple centers, bands repudiating the right, defining themselves on the left, and the families and communities torn apart from white nationalists posing as nihilistic artists. Instead of telling the same old mythology about extreme music, the producers could have given the story three dimensions. And they could have saved the money they sent to a white nationalist.\nAs attacks on women\u2019s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we\u2019re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever.\nAt Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship.

                "html": "<p>There are a variety of ways to describe the Republican reaction to the political rise of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York). There is even <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/conservatives-afraid-alexandria-ocasio-cortez_n_5c38cb74e4b05cb31c421cc3\">some science</a> to help explain their sudden and viciously vociferous interest in her. We can bandy about armchair psychoanalyses and political explanations for this behavior all day long, but in the end, the answer is straightforward: The image of Rep. Ocasio-Cortez has become a Rorschach Test for assholes. &ldquo;What do you see in <em>this</em> Ocasio-Cortez ink blot, Senator Rightdude?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Nothing good, apparently. That&rsquo;s a tall compliment all by itself.</p>\n<p>Admirers and detractors alike call her &ldquo;AOC&rdquo; now, mostly because her full name with title is big enough to merit its own congressional representative and takes a long time to say or type out. That&rsquo;s how it goes sometimes. Nicknames, however, have a way of breeding an oft-unmerited sense of familiarity, and her new GOP enemies have not shied away from talking about AOC in disgustingly personal terms.</p>\n<aside> <p>Never miss the news and analysis you care about.</p>  </aside>\n<p>You can know people by their friends, but you can also know people by their enemies. One good measure of Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is the manner in which she is <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/01/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-right-wing-fan-club-is-growing.html\">pissing off all the right people</a> (pun intended). She is also clapping back in a precise and damaging way her foes have never quite encountered before, further underscoring her character and intelligence.</p>\n<p>One example of this comes courtesy of the singularly useless Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Florida), who <a href=\"https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/florida-rep-matt-gaetz-keeps-calling-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-attractive-11090369\">goes out of his way</a> to call her &ldquo;attractive&rdquo; and &ldquo;adorable&rdquo; at every opportunity. With this sprinkling of his magic sexist dust, Rep. Gaetz seeks to simultaneously diminish her standing as an elected official while objectifying her as nothing more than a vessel for sexual fantasies.</p>\n<p>AOC is having none of it. &ldquo;Just like catcalling, I don&rsquo;t owe a response to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions,&rdquo; she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1027729430137827328\">tweeted</a> regarding another detractor. &ldquo;And also like catcalling, for some reason they feel entitled to one.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Boom. AOC&rsquo;s online counterpunching skills are already the stuff of legend. &ldquo;She has 2.4 million followers on Twitter and another 1.8 million on Instagram,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://prospect.org/article/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-has-super-powers\">writes</a> Paul Waldman for <em>The American Prospect</em>, &ldquo;where she mixes politics, policy, and humor in an appealing combination that few politicians can match.&rdquo; She offered to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1085729475508154368\">teach</a> the House Democratic Caucus how to most effectively use Twitter only days after arriving in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>Any members who missed her class are the worse for it; AOC knows how to use the medium to lethal effect and rope-a-dopes trolls like she was born to the talent. Those abilities have served to twist her newfound adversaries into ever-higher states of agitation and rage. One cable network in particular has taken on the mantle of AOC-Opposer-in-Chief and pursues that role with frenzied, all-encompassing gusto.</p>\n<p>Outside of the fetid swamps of 8chan and message boards of its ilk, there is no place in the US more frantically furious about the rise of AOC than 1211 Avenue of the Americas, headquarters for <em>Fox News</em>. Boy, do they hate them some Ocasio-Cortez, by the minute and the hour and the day and the week. <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2019/03/21/fox-friends-mike-huckabee-suggests-rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-manchurian-candidate/223202\">One highly representative instance</a> came by way of the intellectual vacancy known as <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em>.</p>\n<p>Speaking to guest Mike Huckabee, co-host Brian Kilmeade ominously intoned, &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s writing her questions. I saw the questions at Michael Cohen and saw the questions at Wilbur Ross. And there is some forces behind her.&rdquo; (Pro tip, Bri: Someone <em>is</em> writing her questions, as is true of all lawmakers. They&rsquo;re called congressional staffers, and AOC has some of the best.) Not to be outdone, The Huckster replied, &ldquo;Well, there very well could be. I know there has been some allegations she that was almost like the Manchurian Candidate, recruited, prepared.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Nice use of passive voice there, Huck. There have also been allegations that you couldn&rsquo;t think your way out of a paper sack with a flashlight and a detailed map. Even the grammar in that exchange is a catastrophe: &ldquo;there is some forces behind her,&rdquo; &ldquo;has been some allegations&rdquo;? Plural-singular agreement rules is important, fellas. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s weird. Why are so many grown men just obsessed with this 29-year-old?&rdquo; Ocasio-Cortez <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a26906915/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-fox-news-obsession/\">asked</a> <em>Late Night</em> host Seth Meyers after the Huckabee segment aired. &ldquo;No, but I think it&rsquo;s really funny, and the conspiracy theories are great.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Great, perhaps, but not entirely good. The ceaseless, fact-free assault on AOC and her signature <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text\">Green New Deal proposal</a> has caused her <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/28/18285533/aoc-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-poll-favorables-media\">national poll numbers to suffer</a>, which matters not one bit in her home district but could become cause for concern if she seeks higher office. This is the sort of treatment the right heaped upon Hillary Clinton from the beginning; they started in on her almost 30 years ago with a daily drumbeat of lies and distortions that were brutally effective in the end. AOC is the <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-edit-that-anti-aoc-chant-20190401-os4a4lwrz5aj5jwz73levvp3ba-story.html\">new Hillary</a> at Trump&rsquo;s rallies, with crowds now chanting &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/29/18287033/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-trump-rally-hillary-clinton\">AOC sucks</a>!&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Lock her up!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The tenor of the vitriol directed at AOC, spurred on by a loutish president and a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/11/its-the-sexism-stupid-226620\">wildly sexist corporate media</a> that apparently learned nothing from its coverage debacle in 2016, has rapidly escalated from a condescending &ldquo;Aw, ain&rsquo;t she cute&rdquo; to SHE IS A THREAT TO AMERICA AND MUST BE DESTROYED. &ldquo;An email sent on Tuesday by Tom Ferrall, chairman of the Ohio Federation of College Republicans, bore the subject line &lsquo;AOC is a domestic terrorist&rsquo; and asked recipients to donate to his group,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/10/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-college-republicans-domestic-terrorist\">reported</a> the <em>Guardian</em> on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This puts me in danger every time,&rdquo; Ocasio-Cortez <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1116110421902209025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1116110421902209025%7Ctwgr%5E363937393b70726f64756374696f6e&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Fapr%2F10%2Falexandria-ocasio-cortez-college-republicans-domestic-terrorist\">tweeted</a> in response. &ldquo;Almost every time this uncalled for rhetoric gets blasted by conserv. grps, we get a spike in death threats to refer to Capitol Police.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Indeed, AOC is not alone in this perilous boat. Her fellow freshman, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) got the full <em>Fox</em> treatment after another integrity-free House member, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/the-latest-plot-against-omar-is-a-willful-misreading-of-1833953518\">deliberately misrepresented</a> remarks Rep. Omar made about September 11. <em>The New York Post</em> followed suit with a bombastic and equally disingenuous <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D33yY2pWAAIslSm.jpg\">cover story</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Omar&rsquo;s response to fellow congressman Dan Crenshaw correctly accused him of &lsquo;dangerous incitement,&rsquo;&rdquo; <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/this-is-getting-really-dangerous-1833966570\">writes</a> Katherine Krueger for <em>Splinter</em>. &ldquo;Just last weekend, a New York man was charged with threatening to assault and kill her. Omar has been an outspoken progressive during her brief tenure in Congress, along with her colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and as a result, they&rsquo;ve received a torrent of death threats. Couple that with the disdain her critics also feel for a Muslim woman speaking out, and you have a noxious, combustible gas. This needs to stop, right now, before someone gets hurt.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>We will soon mark the centennial for women&rsquo;s suffrage in the United States, which is nice until you realize half the country&rsquo;s population has only enjoyed the right to vote for about a third of the country&rsquo;s existence. The fight for such elemental rights has been a slow but constant burn with progress made every day, evidenced today by the vivid presence in Congress of women like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar. Before them came women like Barbara Lee and Nita Lowey.</p>\n<p>Those who cling to the idea of ornamental baby-making women existing in silence to please and flatter men are proving the point of the old saying: &ldquo;First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.&rdquo; They are well into the fighting portion of the process regarding Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and all her compatriots.</p>\n<p>The menace is acute, and the danger is real. I have no doubt, however, that AOC will emerge the winner in the end while thoroughly and hilariously owning conservatives on social media along the way.</p>\n<aside><a href=\"https://truthout.org/donate\"> <p>As attacks on women&rsquo;s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we&rsquo;re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever. </p> <p>At Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship. <b>But this is only sustainable if we have your support.</b> If you like what you&rsquo;re reading or just value what we do, will you take a few seconds to contribute to our work? </p>  Donate Now </a></aside>",

                "text": "There are a variety of ways to describe the Republican reaction to the political rise of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York). There is even some science to help explain their sudden and viciously vociferous interest in her. We can bandy about armchair psychoanalyses and political explanations for this behavior all day long, but in the end, the answer is straightforward: The image of Rep. Ocasio-Cortez has become a Rorschach Test for assholes. \u201cWhat do you see in this Ocasio-Cortez ink blot, Senator Rightdude?\u201d\nNothing good, apparently. That\u2019s a tall compliment all by itself.\nAdmirers and detractors alike call her \u201cAOC\u201d now, mostly because her full name with title is big enough to merit its own congressional representative and takes a long time to say or type out. That\u2019s how it goes sometimes. Nicknames, however, have a way of breeding an oft-unmerited sense of familiarity, and her new GOP enemies have not shied away from talking about AOC in disgustingly personal terms.\nNever miss the news and analysis you care about.\nYou can know people by their friends, but you can also know people by their enemies. One good measure of Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is the manner in which she is pissing off all the right people (pun intended). She is also clapping back in a precise and damaging way her foes have never quite encountered before, further underscoring her character and intelligence.\nOne example of this comes courtesy of the singularly useless Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Florida), who goes out of his way to call her \u201cattractive\u201d and \u201cadorable\u201d at every opportunity. With this sprinkling of his magic sexist dust, Rep. Gaetz seeks to simultaneously diminish her standing as an elected official while objectifying her as nothing more than a vessel for sexual fantasies.\nAOC is having none of it. \u201cJust like catcalling, I don\u2019t owe a response to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions,\u201d she tweeted regarding another detractor. \u201cAnd also like catcalling, for some reason they feel entitled to one.\u201d\nBoom. AOC\u2019s online counterpunching skills are already the stuff of legend. \u201cShe has 2.4 million followers on Twitter and another 1.8 million on Instagram,\u201d writes Paul Waldman for The American Prospect, \u201cwhere she mixes politics, policy, and humor in an appealing combination that few politicians can match.\u201d She offered to teach the House Democratic Caucus how to most effectively use Twitter only days after arriving in Washington, D.C.\nAny members who missed her class are the worse for it; AOC knows how to use the medium to lethal effect and rope-a-dopes trolls like she was born to the talent. Those abilities have served to twist her newfound adversaries into ever-higher states of agitation and rage. One cable network in particular has taken on the mantle of AOC-Opposer-in-Chief and pursues that role with frenzied, all-encompassing gusto.\nOutside of the fetid swamps of 8chan and message boards of its ilk, there is no place in the US more frantically furious about the rise of AOC than 1211 Avenue of the Americas, headquarters for Fox News. Boy, do they hate them some Ocasio-Cortez, by the minute and the hour and the day and the week. One highly representative instance came by way of the intellectual vacancy known as Fox & Friends.\nSpeaking to guest Mike Huckabee, co-host Brian Kilmeade ominously intoned, \u201cSomebody\u2019s writing her questions. I saw the questions at Michael Cohen and saw the questions at Wilbur Ross. And there is some forces behind her.\u201d (Pro tip, Bri: Someone is writing her questions, as is true of all lawmakers. They\u2019re called congressional staffers, and AOC has some of the best.) Not to be outdone, The Huckster replied, \u201cWell, there very well could be. I know there has been some allegations she that was almost like the Manchurian Candidate, recruited, prepared.\u201d\nNice use of passive voice there, Huck. There have also been allegations that you couldn\u2019t think your way out of a paper sack with a flashlight and a detailed map. Even the grammar in that exchange is a catastrophe: \u201cthere is some forces behind her,\u201d \u201chas been some allegations\u201d? Plural-singular agreement rules is important, fellas. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. Why are so many grown men just obsessed with this 29-year-old?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked Late Night host Seth Meyers after the Huckabee segment aired. \u201cNo, but I think it\u2019s really funny, and the conspiracy theories are great.\u201d\nGreat, perhaps, but not entirely good. The ceaseless, fact-free assault on AOC and her signature Green New Deal proposal has caused her national poll numbers to suffer, which matters not one bit in her home district but could become cause for concern if she seeks higher office. This is the sort of treatment the right heaped upon Hillary Clinton from the beginning; they started in on her almost 30 years ago with a daily drumbeat of lies and distortions that were brutally effective in the end. AOC is the new Hillary at Trump\u2019s rallies, with crowds now chanting \u201cAOC sucks!\u201d instead of \u201cLock her up!\u201d\nThe tenor of the vitriol directed at AOC, spurred on by a loutish president and a wildly sexist corporate media that apparently learned nothing from its coverage debacle in 2016, has rapidly escalated from a condescending \u201cAw, ain\u2019t she cute\u201d to SHE IS A THREAT TO AMERICA AND MUST BE DESTROYED. \u201cAn email sent on Tuesday by Tom Ferrall, chairman of the Ohio Federation of College Republicans, bore the subject line \u2018AOC is a domestic terrorist\u2019 and asked recipients to donate to his group,\u201d reported the Guardian on Wednesday.\n\u201cThis puts me in danger every time,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in response. \u201cAlmost every time this uncalled for rhetoric gets blasted by conserv. grps, we get a spike in death threats to refer to Capitol Police.\u201d\nIndeed, AOC is not alone in this perilous boat. Her fellow freshman, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) got the full Fox treatment after another integrity-free House member, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) deliberately misrepresented remarks Rep. Omar made about September 11. The New York Post followed suit with a bombastic and equally disingenuous cover story.\n\u201cOmar\u2019s response to fellow congressman Dan Crenshaw correctly accused him of \u2018dangerous incitement,\u2019\u201d writes Katherine Krueger for Splinter. \u201cJust last weekend, a New York man was charged with threatening to assault and kill her. Omar has been an outspoken progressive during her brief tenure in Congress, along with her colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and as a result, they\u2019ve received a torrent of death threats. Couple that with the disdain her critics also feel for a Muslim woman speaking out, and you have a noxious, combustible gas. This needs to stop, right now, before someone gets hurt.\u201d\nWe will soon mark the centennial for women\u2019s suffrage in the United States, which is nice until you realize half the country\u2019s population has only enjoyed the right to vote for about a third of the country\u2019s existence. The fight for such elemental rights has been a slow but constant burn with progress made every day, evidenced today by the vivid presence in Congress of women like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar. Before them came women like Barbara Lee and Nita Lowey.\nThose who cling to the idea of ornamental baby-making women existing in silence to please and flatter men are proving the point of the old saying: \u201cFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\u201d They are well into the fighting portion of the process regarding Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and all her compatriots.\nThe menace is acute, and the danger is real. I have no doubt, however, that AOC will emerge the winner in the end while thoroughly and hilariously owning conservatives on social media along the way.\nAs attacks on women\u2019s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we\u2019re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever.\nAt Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship.

                "html": "<p>It has been a bruising run of days for Donald Trump. The trouble began last Thursday with kicks to both kidneys, delivered by a cadre of his Republican Snuggle Bunnies in the House and Senate. The first, from the House, was a rare and resounding show of unity from that chamber when they passed a nonbinding demand that the Mueller report be made public.</p>\n<p>The motion was carried by a thumping margin of 420-0, yet still had to gum its food for lack of teeth &mdash; but even its purely symbolic nature was still too powerful for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), who <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/434124-graham-blocks-resolution-calling-for-mueller-report-to-be-made-public\">blocked</a> the demand upon its arrival in the Senate. Why? He wants another investigation into Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s emails first, because of course he does.</p>\n<p>Later that day, 12 Republican senators <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-renews-veto-threat-as-senate-prepares-to-rebuke-him-on-national-emergency/2019/03/14/2efbea36-4647-11e9-aaf8-4512a6fe3439_story.html?utm_term=.d8139bc097d0\">broke ranks</a> and voted with every Democrat to nullify Trump&rsquo;s emergency declaration, joining the 13 House Republicans who also voted with the Democrats to nullify it. Trump, in response, <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/829750/trump-pettiest-president\">threw a tantrum</a> that was incredible even by his lofty standards. In an aftermath interview <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/03/13/exclusive-president-donald-trump-paul-ryan-blocked-subpoenas-of-democrats/\">with Breitbart</a>, he went so far as to threaten the political left with violence from police, soldiers and biker gangs because he didn&rsquo;t get his way.</p>\n<aside><h2>Uncompromised, uncompromising news</h2> <p>Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.</p>  </aside>\n<p>White supremacist terrorism in New Zealand derailed Trump&rsquo;s rant, affording him the opportunity to offer victims of that attack <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1106520743855251456\">something</a> he called &ldquo;warmest sympathy&rdquo; (&ldquo;thoughts and prayers&rdquo; are apparently only available to stateside victims of white supremacist terrorism). The vote, however, stood, and Trump quickly deployed the first <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1106272915488686080\">veto</a> of his administration. Personally, I hope it tasted like ashes.</p>\n<p>(The horrific anti-immigrant attack in New Zealand put the White House in a tight spot: How to explain away the antics of a racist-coddling president? Pro tip: When the top administrator in the executive branch feels compelled to tell Fox News the boss <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/mick-mulvaney-insists-that-trump-is-not-a-white-suprem-1833361549\">isn&rsquo;t a white supremacist</a>, and underscores that assertion with a complaint about how many times he&rsquo;s had to say the boss isn&rsquo;t a white supremacist, the boss is probably a white supremacist. At this point, the only people who buy what Mick Mulvaney was peddling are the ones who don&rsquo;t know what the words mean. Even white supremacists are like, <em>Dude, enough already, the cat&rsquo;s all the way out of the bag.</em>)</p>\n<p>Because these are Republicans we&rsquo;re talking about, there was as usual an abundance of absurdity freighting the Senate vote. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) in particular covered himself in obsequious shame and eternal ignominy during the process. A few weeks earlier, Tillis had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/25/i-support-trumps-vision-border-security-i-would-vote-against-emergency/?utm_term=.843cee91caf3\">authored</a> an op-ed for <em>The Washington Post</em> announcing his intention to vote against Trump&rsquo;s emergency declaration, stating any support for it had &ldquo;no intellectual honesty.&rdquo; Flash forward to Thursday, and Tillis &mdash; who is facing re-election next year &ndash; abruptly reversed himself and voted Trump&rsquo;s way.</p>\n<p>The funny part about Tillis&rsquo;s vote is his explanation for why he did it. It appears the senator was &ldquo;reassured&rdquo; by &ldquo;indications&rdquo; Trump would be willing to tamp down presidential emergency powers via new legislation if his current declaration was allowed to stand. Where Tillis got these indications remains a mystery, because a group of GOP senators offered Trump a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/us/politics/trump-emergency-declaration-republicans.html\">compromise</a> to do exactly that just days before, only to have Trump curse at them before throwing them out of the building. My guess? Trump wants those emergency powers fully intact if he loses the 2020 election, but then again, <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/trump-may-want-to-be-president-forever-take-the-threat-seriously/\">I&rsquo;m a worrier</a>.</p>\n<p>Thom &ldquo;Against It For It&rdquo; Tillis is a marvelous avatar for the modern Republican phenomenon. Television pundits were dislocating shoulders trying to pat themselves on the back because the GOP, according to those pundits&rsquo; oft-offered predictions, was finally coming around. Clearly, they claimed, this is a whole new day. Those 12 brave Republican senators and those 13 brave House members have finally thrown off the yoke of Trump&rsquo;s tyranny and everything will be different now, you&rsquo;ll see.</p>\n<p>All-day wrong. The cowardice of Thom Tillis was not the exception, but the rule. Tillis is looking at tight 2020 numbers and is terrified of running for re-election with his name newly inked on Trump&rsquo;s enemies list, so he folded. The senators and House members who voted against Trump were just doing their own electoral math and figured they were safe enough to survive his wrath. One way or another, we&rsquo;ll know two Novembers from now.</p>\n<p>In point of fact, this was maybe the easiest vote those 25 Republicans ever cast, because each and every one of them knows they have two sturdy firewalls backing them up. Trump vetoed the nullification of his declaration before the ink was dry, and a two-thirds majority in both chambers is needed to override a veto. Mathematically, that translates into 20 Republican senators voting with every Democrat and Independent to make 67, and 54 Republican House members voting with every Democrat and Independent to make 290, to reach the override threshold.</p>\n<p>The possibility of finding those 20 Republican votes to override in the Senate is Oort-cloud remote, but you can still see it with a strong enough telescope. The chances of finding 54 Republican votes in the House, however, are quite simply nil. This is still politics, so circumstances could change in the intervening days, but I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on it with free money.</p>\n<p>That &ldquo;whole new day&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t coming any time soon. &ldquo;Haute Doormat&rdquo; is still the fashion in D.C. Republican circles. There are no heroes in the GOP.</p>\n<aside><a href=\"https://truthout.org/donate\"><h4>The stakes have never been higher</h4> <p>As attacks on women&rsquo;s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we&rsquo;re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever. </p> <p>At Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship. <b>But this is only sustainable if we have your support.</b> If you like what you&rsquo;re reading or just value what we do, will you take a few seconds to contribute to our work? </p>  Donate Now </a></aside>",

                "text": "It has been a bruising run of days for Donald Trump. The trouble began last Thursday with kicks to both kidneys, delivered by a cadre of his Republican Snuggle Bunnies in the House and Senate. The first, from the House, was a rare and resounding show of unity from that chamber when they passed a nonbinding demand that the Mueller report be made public.\nThe motion was carried by a thumping margin of 420-0, yet still had to gum its food for lack of teeth \u2014 but even its purely symbolic nature was still too powerful for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), who blocked the demand upon its arrival in the Senate. Why? He wants another investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails first, because of course he does.\nLater that day, 12 Republican senators broke ranks and voted with every Democrat to nullify Trump\u2019s emergency declaration, joining the 13 House Republicans who also voted with the Democrats to nullify it. Trump, in response, threw a tantrum that was incredible even by his lofty standards. In an aftermath interview with Breitbart, he went so far as to threaten the political left with violence from police, soldiers and biker gangs because he didn\u2019t get his way.\nUncompromised, uncompromising news\nGet reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.\nWhite supremacist terrorism in New Zealand derailed Trump\u2019s rant, affording him the opportunity to offer victims of that attack something he called \u201cwarmest sympathy\u201d (\u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d are apparently only available to stateside victims of white supremacist terrorism). The vote, however, stood, and Trump quickly deployed the first veto of his administration. Personally, I hope it tasted like ashes.\n(The horrific anti-immigrant attack in New Zealand put the White House in a tight spot: How to explain away the antics of a racist-coddling president? Pro tip: When the top administrator in the executive branch feels compelled to tell Fox News the boss isn\u2019t a white supremacist, and underscores that assertion with a complaint about how many times he\u2019s had to say the boss isn\u2019t a white supremacist, the boss is probably a white supremacist. At this point, the only people who buy what Mick Mulvaney was peddling are the ones who don\u2019t know what the words mean. Even white supremacists are like, Dude, enough already, the cat\u2019s all the way out of the bag.)\nBecause these are Republicans we\u2019re talking about, there was as usual an abundance of absurdity freighting the Senate vote. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) in particular covered himself in obsequious shame and eternal ignominy during the process. A few weeks earlier, Tillis had authored an op-ed for The Washington Post announcing his intention to vote against Trump\u2019s emergency declaration, stating any support for it had \u201cno intellectual honesty.\u201d Flash forward to Thursday, and Tillis \u2014 who is facing re-election next year \u2013 abruptly reversed himself and voted Trump\u2019s way.\nThe funny part about Tillis\u2019s vote is his explanation for why he did it. It appears the senator was \u201creassured\u201d by \u201cindications\u201d Trump would be willing to tamp down presidential emergency powers via new legislation if his current declaration was allowed to stand. Where Tillis got these indications remains a mystery, because a group of GOP senators offered Trump a compromise to do exactly that just days before, only to have Trump curse at them before throwing them out of the building. My guess? Trump wants those emergency powers fully intact if he loses the 2020 election, but then again, I\u2019m a worrier.\nThom \u201cAgainst It For It\u201d Tillis is a marvelous avatar for the modern Republican phenomenon. Television pundits were dislocating shoulders trying to pat themselves on the back because the GOP, according to those pundits\u2019 oft-offered predictions, was finally coming around. Clearly, they claimed, this is a whole new day. Those 12 brave Republican senators and those 13 brave House members have finally thrown off the yoke of Trump\u2019s tyranny and everything will be different now, you\u2019ll see.\nAll-day wrong. The cowardice of Thom Tillis was not the exception, but the rule. Tillis is looking at tight 2020 numbers and is terrified of running for re-election with his name newly inked on Trump\u2019s enemies list, so he folded. The senators and House members who voted against Trump were just doing their own electoral math and figured they were safe enough to survive his wrath. One way or another, we\u2019ll know two Novembers from now.\nIn point of fact, this was maybe the easiest vote those 25 Republicans ever cast, because each and every one of them knows they have two sturdy firewalls backing them up. Trump vetoed the nullification of his declaration before the ink was dry, and a two-thirds majority in both chambers is needed to override a veto. Mathematically, that translates into 20 Republican senators voting with every Democrat and Independent to make 67, and 54 Republican House members voting with every Democrat and Independent to make 290, to reach the override threshold.\nThe possibility of finding those 20 Republican votes to override in the Senate is Oort-cloud remote, but you can still see it with a strong enough telescope. The chances of finding 54 Republican votes in the House, however, are quite simply nil. This is still politics, so circumstances could change in the intervening days, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it with free money.\nThat \u201cwhole new day\u201d isn\u2019t coming any time soon. \u201cHaute Doormat\u201d is still the fashion in D.C. Republican circles. There are no heroes in the GOP.\nThe stakes have never been higher\nAs attacks on women\u2019s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we\u2019re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever.\nAt Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship. But this is only sustainable if we have your support. If you like what you\u2019re reading or just value what we do, will you take a few seconds to contribute to our work?\nDonate Now",

                "html": "<p>We stand today upon the fulcrum of history, a crossroads at midnight with a blood moon rising. Down one road lies fire, flood, famine, failure and the final triumph of greed. What awaits down the other road is unknown, terra incognita, a mystery to be solved one gentle step at a time. As a species, we tend to recoil from what we do not know, often choosing the awful alternative simply because it is familiar. Now, even that poor option is a suicidal indulgence leading inexorably to our common doom.</p>\n<p>Everyone, from leader to laborer, is a teacher delivering a simple lesson: how to be, or how not to be. We go to school on the words and behavior of others, and it falls to us as individuals to either absorb what those others teach us by being who they are, or to cast their lessons aside in search of more worthy instruction. As bad lawsuits make bad law, however, bad people make worse people by example. We are often childlike in our emulation of what we see, and if we only see scoundrels, well &hellip; that script writes itself.</p>\n<p>Which brings us to a most valuable teacher: a privileged, compromised, cowardly, racist, sexist, hate-swaddled, power-mad, greed-gorged, double-dealing, fathomless void where all integrity goes to die. I speak, of course, of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. If Donald Trump is the Devil waiting at that moonlit crossroads to tune our guitar at the cost of our souls, Mitch McConnell drove him there and paid for the gas.</p>\n<aside> <p>Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.</p>  </aside>\n<p>Mitch McConnell is valuable because he teaches us in graphic fashion how not to be. In his own words, McConnell shines a light down that road to ruin &mdash; his road, his way &mdash; and compels us for our own sake to choose the other route. He serves to make the decision binary: zero vs. one, nothing vs. something, altogether elegant in its simplicity.</p>\n<p>McConnell was <a href=\"https://hotair.com/archives/2019/02/19/mcconnell-aoc-first-time-career-thought-essence-america-debated/\">featured</a> in a recent Wall Street Journal article about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Green New Deal and the mainstreaming of progressive policy initiatives. &ldquo;I can pretty safely say,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;this is the first time in my political career that I thought the essence of America was being debated.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Whoomp, as the song says. There it is.</p>\n<aside>If Donald Trump is the Devil waiting at that moonlit crossroads, Mitch McConnell drove him there and paid for the gas.</aside>\n<p>&ldquo;American democracy has never accorded all the people a meaningful voice,&rdquo; writes Nancy Isenberg in <em>White Trash</em>, her scathing examination of ignored U.S. history. &ldquo;The masses have been given symbols instead, and they are often empty symbols. Nation-states traditionally rely on the fiction that a head of state can represent the body of the people and stand as their proxy; in the American version, the president must appeal broadly to shared values that mask the existence of deep class divisions. Even when this strategy works, unity comes at the price of perpetuating ideological deception. Instead of a thoroughgoing democracy, Americans have settled for democratic stagecraft.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It is all of a piece, the centuries-old notion of this country as a paycheck for the few at the expense of the many. British colonialists sought to peel the land using kidnapped Africans and impoverished Britons, slaughtering and displacing Native peoples wherever and whenever they were encountered. Wealth must be compounded with wealth, power must be held by the few to wield against the many. The fiction of democracy provides an illusion of freedom to obscure the looting that was the whole point of the endeavor to begin with.</p>\n<p>Mitch McConnell is a highly visible champion of that ideological deception, a deft practitioner of that stagecraft. The &ldquo;essence of America&rdquo; he spoke of certainly exists, but cunning politicians of his ilk are too canny to mention it in public. That essence &mdash; the belief that the nation and its population are a gilded platter to be gorged upon, a fertile field to be plundered and despoiled for profit with the people serving as replaceable tools for the aristocracy &mdash; is McConnell&rsquo;s poisoned birthright, and he defends it with all the powers at his disposal, just as his colonial predecessors did.</p>\n<p>By recognizing this, we recognize Mitch, and all who rally to his banner. They want freedom for themselves, not for you. Their &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; is elite, expensive and jealously guarded. Yet a thousand choices on Netflix is not freedom, any more than the constant choice of corporate political candidates is freedom, but therein lies the illusion. <em>Pick your poison. See? You&rsquo;re free!</em></p>\n<p>McConnell&rsquo;s &ldquo;essence&rdquo; is a con, a sham history inflicted upon us from our first kindergarten recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance: &ldquo;With liberty and justice for all.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside>The fiction of democracy provides an illusion of freedom to obscure the looting that was the whole point of the endeavor to begin with.</aside>\n<p>And yet there are six words that have caused great consternation over the years for men like Mitch. Nathaniel Philbrick, in his book <em>Bunker Hill</em>, compellingly describes &ldquo;the unappreciated radicalism within the Declaration of Independence &ndash; &lsquo;that all men are created equal.&rsquo;&rdquo; At the time, it was a lie, what Philbrick describes as &ldquo;a rhetorical flourish.&rdquo; Native peoples, enslaved Africans, women and the economically dispossessed did not merit equality in the eyes of the Framers. But those six words have come to be a thumb in the eye to what Mitch McConnell meant when he speaks of &ldquo;the essence of America.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Indeed, those six words are now correctly taken by many as a demand for equal rights for men, women, poor people, people of color, immigrants, people with disabilities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, the elderly, the incarcerated, children, laborers and every other human being who breathes the same air. The Framers did not mean it, but they damn well wrote it down, and public officials of every stripe swear an oath to defend it every single day.</p>\n<p>Obtaining those rights has been an ongoing multi-century bloodbath because those who subscribe to McConnell&rsquo;s &ldquo;essence&rdquo; choose to ignore the imperative embedded within those six words. For them, equality is bad for the bottom line and rattles the calcified infrastructure of entrenched power. Their violent devotion to that &ldquo;essence&rdquo; has caused unspeakable agony and degradation even to this day, but that is not their concern.</p>\n<p>Men like Mitch McConnell flee the very notion of those six words, because at the far end of the struggle for equality lurks a bill to be paid. Nothing so final as a guillotine awaits them at the conclusion; merely a sharing of power and wealth, of rights and privileges, which is anathema to them and their rampant belief in their own superiority. To fight this rising tide, they divide and denounce, fashioning enemies out of natural allies because when we fight each other, we serve them.</p>\n<p>Look no further than the tumult of the moment to witness how far the few will go to confuse and control the many. See their white nationalist puppets on the march and immigrants on the run; see the Black people cut down by the police officer&rsquo;s gun; see women using a social media hashtag to explain how it has always been so it may someday cease to be; see the people deprived of options by the economics of enforced inequality fed into the maw of a profitable war machine; see LGBTQ+ people stripped of rights by a heteronormalized society that uses splinter Christianity to rationalize fear and hate; see the rage-flecked faces at one of Donald Trump&rsquo;s rallies as they howl at enemies conveniently created to incur their distracted wrath; and see the oceans rising and the fires burning because the nature of plunder is damage. This is the place we have been, and the place we are going, if we choose poorly at this crossroads.</p>\n<p>And therein lies the rub, because Mitch McConnell was absolutely correct. The essence of this country <em>as he understands it</em> is not merely being debated, it is being run to ground and throttled, finally. The anger on display from those who have been privileged to own center stage in this society comes from the fact that voices besides their own are finally being widely heard.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sharing&rdquo; is not in their lexicon, and so we must see this as a teachable moment. Not a vengeance tour but an education, because we are all teachers, and there is a better way. Pediatricians call it &ldquo;growing pains,&rdquo; biologists call it &ldquo;evolution,&rdquo; and I call it fulfilling the promise of those six radical words. Hell, we might even get around to applying a long-required tweak to those words: &ldquo;All people are created equal.&rdquo; This version, at last, has the virtue of being true.</p>\n<p>The road we have been on is littered with bones and sorrow. The road we must take is strange, and new, and dangerous, and difficult. There are no promises, other than it will be &ndash; by dint of our collective will &ndash; better than the way that is failing before our eyes. This crossroads is freedom distilled, and the time to choose is now.</p>\n<p>Change is coming, Mitch. Not a slogan. A fact.

                "text": "We stand today upon the fulcrum of history, a crossroads at midnight with a blood moon rising. Down one road lies fire, flood, famine, failure and the final triumph of greed. What awaits down the other road is unknown, terra incognita, a mystery to be solved one gentle step at a time. As a species, we tend to recoil from what we do not know, often choosing the awful alternative simply because it is familiar. Now, even that poor option is a suicidal indulgence leading inexorably to our common doom.\nEveryone, from leader to laborer, is a teacher delivering a simple lesson: how to be, or how not to be. We go to school on the words and behavior of others, and it falls to us as individuals to either absorb what those others teach us by being who they are, or to cast their lessons aside in search of more worthy instruction. As bad lawsuits make bad law, however, bad people make worse people by example. We are often childlike in our emulation of what we see, and if we only see scoundrels, well \u2026 that script writes itself.\nWhich brings us to a most valuable teacher: a privileged, compromised, cowardly, racist, sexist, hate-swaddled, power-mad, greed-gorged, double-dealing, fathomless void where all integrity goes to die. I speak, of course, of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. If Donald Trump is the Devil waiting at that moonlit crossroads to tune our guitar at the cost of our souls, Mitch McConnell drove him there and paid for the gas.\nGet the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.\nMitch McConnell is valuable because he teaches us in graphic fashion how not to be. In his own words, McConnell shines a light down that road to ruin \u2014 his road, his way \u2014 and compels us for our own sake to choose the other route. He serves to make the decision binary: zero vs. one, nothing vs. something, altogether elegant in its simplicity.\nMcConnell was featured in a recent Wall Street Journal article about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Green New Deal and the mainstreaming of progressive policy initiatives. \u201cI can pretty safely say,\u201d he declared, \u201cthis is the first time in my political career that I thought the essence of America was being debated.\u201d\nWhoomp, as the song says. There it is.\nIf Donald Trump is the Devil waiting at that moonlit crossroads, Mitch McConnell drove him there and paid for the gas.\n\u201cAmerican democracy has never accorded all the people a meaningful voice,\u201d writes Nancy Isenberg in White Trash, her scathing examination of ignored U.S. history. \u201cThe masses have been given symbols instead, and they are often empty symbols. Nation-states traditionally rely on the fiction that a head of state can represent the body of the people and stand as their proxy; in the American version, the president must appeal broadly to shared values that mask the existence of deep class divisions. Even when this strategy works, unity comes at the price of perpetuating ideological deception. Instead of a thoroughgoing democracy, Americans have settled for democratic stagecraft.\u201d\nIt is all of a piece, the centuries-old notion of this country as a paycheck for the few at the expense of the many. British colonialists sought to peel the land using kidnapped Africans and impoverished Britons, slaughtering and displacing Native peoples wherever and whenever they were encountered. Wealth must be compounded with wealth, power must be held by the few to wield against the many. The fiction of democracy provides an illusion of freedom to obscure the looting that was the whole point of the endeavor to begin with.\nMitch McConnell is a highly visible champion of that ideological deception, a deft practitioner of that stagecraft. The \u201cessence of America\u201d he spoke of certainly exists, but cunning politicians of his ilk are too canny to mention it in public. That essence \u2014 the belief that the nation and its population are a gilded platter to be gorged upon, a fertile field to be plundered and despoiled for profit with the people serving as replaceable tools for the aristocracy \u2014 is McConnell\u2019s poisoned birthright, and he defends it with all the powers at his disposal, just as his colonial predecessors did.\nBy recognizing this, we recognize Mitch, and all who rally to his banner. They want freedom for themselves, not for you. Their \u201cfreedom\u201d is elite, expensive and jealously guarded. Yet a thousand choices on Netflix is not freedom, any more than the constant choice of corporate political candidates is freedom, but therein lies the illusion. Pick your poison. See? You\u2019re free!\nMcConnell\u2019s \u201cessence\u201d is a con, a sham history inflicted upon us from our first kindergarten recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance: \u201cWith liberty and justice for all.\u201d\nThe fiction of democracy provides an illusion of freedom to obscure the looting that was the whole point of the endeavor to begin with.\nAnd yet there are six words that have caused great consternation over the years for men like Mitch. Nathaniel Philbrick, in his book Bunker Hill, compellingly describes \u201cthe unappreciated radicalism within the Declaration of Independence \u2013 \u2018that all men are created equal.\u2019\u201d At the time, it was a lie, what Philbrick describes as \u201ca rhetorical flourish.\u201d Native peoples, enslaved Africans, women and the economically dispossessed did not merit equality in the eyes of the Framers. But those six words have come to be a thumb in the eye to what Mitch McConnell meant when he speaks of \u201cthe essence of America.\u201d\nIndeed, those six words are now correctly taken by many as a demand for equal rights for men, women, poor people, people of color, immigrants, people with disabilities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, the elderly, the incarcerated, children, laborers and every other human being who breathes the same air. The Framers did not mean it, but they damn well wrote it down, and public officials of every stripe swear an oath to defend it every single day.\nObtaining those rights has been an ongoing multi-century bloodbath because those who subscribe to McConnell\u2019s \u201cessence\u201d choose to ignore the imperative embedded within those six words. For them, equality is bad for the bottom line and rattles the calcified infrastructure of entrenched power. Their violent devotion to that \u201cessence\u201d has caused unspeakable agony and degradation even to this day, but that is not their concern.\nMen like Mitch McConnell flee the very notion of those six words, because at the far end of the struggle for equality lurks a bill to be paid. Nothing so final as a guillotine awaits them at the conclusion; merely a sharing of power and wealth, of rights and privileges, which is anathema to them and their rampant belief in their own superiority. To fight this rising tide, they divide and denounce, fashioning enemies out of natural allies because when we fight each other, we serve them.\nLook no further than the tumult of the moment to witness how far the few will go to confuse and control the many. See their white nationalist puppets on the march and immigrants on the run; see the Black people cut down by the police officer\u2019s gun; see women using a social media hashtag to explain how it has always been so it may someday cease to be; see the people deprived of options by the economics of enforced inequality fed into the maw of a profitable war machine; see LGBTQ+ people stripped of rights by a heteronormalized society that uses splinter Christianity to rationalize fear and hate; see the rage-flecked faces at one of Donald Trump\u2019s rallies as they howl at enemies conveniently created to incur their distracted wrath; and see the oceans rising and the fires burning because the nature of plunder is damage. This is the place we have been, and the place we are going, if we choose poorly at this crossroads.\nAnd therein lies the rub, because Mitch McConnell was absolutely correct. The essence of this country as he understands it is not merely being debated, it is being run to ground and throttled, finally. The anger on display from those who have been privileged to own center stage in this society comes from the fact that voices besides their own are finally being widely heard.\n\u201cSharing\u201d is not in their lexicon, and so we must see this as a teachable moment. Not a vengeance tour but an education, because we are all teachers, and there is a better way. Pediatricians call it \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d biologists call it \u201cevolution,\u201d and I call it fulfilling the promise of those six radical words. Hell, we might even get around to applying a long-required tweak to those words: \u201cAll people are created equal.\u201d This version, at last, has the virtue of being true.\nThe road we have been on is littered with bones and sorrow. The road we must take is strange, and new, and dangerous, and difficult. There are no promises, other than it will be \u2013 by dint of our collective will \u2013 better than the way that is failing before our eyes. This crossroads is freedom distilled, and the time to choose is now.\nChange is coming, Mitch. Not a slogan. A fact. Tell your friends.\nThe stakes have never been higher\nAs attacks on women\u2019s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we\u2019re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever.\nAt Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship.

                "html": "<p>One of the most striking features of our era is the widening gap between rich and poor. In fact, wealth inequality may be higher today than any other era, although we lack the data to draw meaningful comparisons with the distant past. Moreover, the gap between the haves and the have-nots seems to be growing, as the <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/annual-reports\">annual reports</a> from the development charity Oxfam clearly indicate. What are the key reasons for the growing divide between rich and poor, especially when governments claim that there is a recovery underway since the 2008 global financial crisis? And what can be done to reorganize society so wealth is no longer concentrated into so few hands while millions of people live in extreme poverty or are barely subsisting? In the interview below, <a href=\"https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/tomweisskopf/\">Thomas Weisskopf</a>, emeritus professor of economics at the University of Michigan and a long-time member of the Democratic Socialists of America, offers his insights on the state of economic injustice.</p>\n<p><strong>C.J. Polychroniou: Professor Weisskopf, according to the 2019 Oxfam report, a handful of billionaires own <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/22/18192774/oxfam-inequality-report-2019-davos-wealth\">as much wealth</a> as the poorest half of the world&rsquo;s population. In fact, 2018 was a year in which the <a href=\"https://www.lifegate.com/people/news/world-inequality-report-2018\">rich got richer again and the poor, poorer</a>. Do we know the primary culprits behind the ever-growing gap in economic well-being between rich and poor? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thomas Weisskopf:</strong> There are both economic and political reasons for the growing wealth gap between the very rich and the poor. The natural tendency of capitalism is to generate both overall economic growth and ever-increasing inequality in both wealth and income. Most people do not have the opportunity to acquire much wealth, but those who have inherited or accumulated a certain amount of wealth have many opportunities to increase it, and the more wealth you have, the easier it is to do so. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2015/01/30/wealth-inheritance-and-social-mobility/\">Wealth</a> is everywhere much more unequally distributed than income, because those who have wealth can use it to generate even more. The distribution of wealth has a huge impact on the distribution of income, because wealth is an important source of income &mdash; especially for the very rich.</p>\n<aside> <p>Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.</p>  </aside>\n<p>The underlying unequalizing tendency of capitalism can be interrupted by catastrophic developments &mdash; such as wars or major economic crises, which can shrink the wealth of an entire capitalist class, or natural disasters which can destroy the wealth of individuals whose wealth is vulnerable to such events. World Wars I and II, as well as the Great Depression of the 1930s, had the effect of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/19/history-suggests-there-is-a-way-to-lower-inequality-but-youre-not-going-to-like-it/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.8209991faed3\">reducing the degree of wealth and income inequality around the world</a>.</p>\n<p>The natural unequalizing tendency of capitalism can also be limited, and sometimes even reversed, by political intervention. From the end of World War II to the 1970s the capitalist world achieved <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/a-guide-to-statistics-on-historical-trends-in-income-inequality\">rapid economic growth without much increase in wealth and income inequality</a>, because most governments took responsibility for assuring that the gains from growth would be widely shared. They did this through a variety of means, including relatively high (by current standards) taxes on wealth and income, which funded government spending on public programs that had the effect of redistributing income and opportunities from richer to poorer segments of the populations, well as policies that curbed the power of large corporations and protected workers from exploitation by employers.

                "text": "One of the most striking features of our era is the widening gap between rich and poor. In fact, wealth inequality may be higher today than any other era, although we lack the data to draw meaningful comparisons with the distant past. Moreover, the gap between the haves and the have-nots seems to be growing, as the annual reports from the development charity Oxfam clearly indicate. What are the key reasons for the growing divide between rich and poor, especially when governments claim that there is a recovery underway since the 2008 global financial crisis? And what can be done to reorganize society so wealth is no longer concentrated into so few hands while millions of people live in extreme poverty or are barely subsisting? In the interview below, Thomas Weisskopf, emeritus professor of economics at the University of Michigan and a long-time member of the Democratic Socialists of America, offers his insights on the state of economic injustice.\nC.J. Polychroniou: Professor Weisskopf, according to the 2019 Oxfam report, a handful of billionaires own as much wealth as the poorest half of the world\u2019s population. In fact, 2018 was a year in which the rich got richer again and the poor, poorer. Do we know the primary culprits behind the ever-growing gap in economic well-being between rich and poor?\nThomas Weisskopf: There are both economic and political reasons for the growing wealth gap between the very rich and the poor. The natural tendency of capitalism is to generate both overall economic growth and ever-increasing inequality in both wealth and income. Most people do not have the opportunity to acquire much wealth, but those who have inherited or accumulated a certain amount of wealth have many opportunities to increase it, and the more wealth you have, the easier it is to do so. Wealth is everywhere much more unequally distributed than income, because those who have wealth can use it to generate even more. The distribution of wealth has a huge impact on the distribution of income, because wealth is an important source of income \u2014 especially for the very rich.\nGet the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.\nThe underlying unequalizing tendency of capitalism can be interrupted by catastrophic developments \u2014 such as wars or major economic crises, which can shrink the wealth of an entire capitalist class, or natural disasters which can destroy the wealth of individuals whose wealth is vulnerable to such events. World Wars I and II, as well as the Great Depression of the 1930s, had the effect of reducing the degree of wealth and income inequality around the world.\nThe natural unequalizing tendency of capitalism can also be limited, and sometimes even reversed, by political intervention. From the end of World War II to the 1970s the capitalist world achieved rapid economic growth without much increase in wealth and income inequality, because most governments took responsibility for assuring that the gains from growth would be widely shared. They did this through a variety of means, including relatively high (by current standards) taxes on wealth and income, which funded government spending on public programs that had the effect of redistributing income and opportunities from richer to poorer segments of the populations, well as policies that curbed the power of large corporations and protected workers from exploitation by employers. Beginning in the late 1970s, government policies in many capitalist countries \u2014 most markedly in the U.K. and the U.S. \u2014 shifted toward less redistributive tax and spending policies, less regulation of large corporations, and less protection for workers.\nShould we really be concerned with wealth and income inequality or with poverty?\nWe should be concerned with all of the above. Wealth provides long-term security, and it opens up all kinds of opportunities for the wealth-holder \u2014 whether as a source of income, for spending beyond one\u2019s income, or for weighing in on public affairs, such as buying political influence and thus shifting almost entirely the balance of power toward the interests, needs and whims of the rich and influential. Poverty characterizes people who do not have sufficient income, wealth or access to resources to meet their basic human needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, medical care, good education. Every society should feel obligated to enable all of its members to live at such a basic minimal standard. It would be perfectly possible to do so even in a context of growing overall inequality in wealth and income. But such growing inequality itself has numerous adverse consequences for a society, as I discuss below.\nWhat are the primary consequences of massive income and wealth inequality for the advanced industrialized societies?\nMassive economic inequality usually means that a substantial share of the population at the lower end of the scale cannot meet their basic human needs. But misery for those at the bottom of the scale is by no means the only negative consequence of such inequality. There are many respects in which one\u2019s well-being depends on one\u2019s relative, rather than absolute, economic position. First, the way one is treated depends a great deal on one\u2019s economic status and resources; those well below the societal average are likely to be disrespected and disfavored, whereas those far above are likely to be given undue deference and granted undue favors. Great economic inequality makes it impossible to achieve anything like equality of opportunity, because one\u2019s access to opportunities depends greatly on one\u2019s initial position relative to others. This is especially the case with opportunities that are necessarily limited in supply \u2014 such as access to the best institutions in which to study or work, or to the best locations in which to live, or to positions of power and influence. Not only the impoverished at the bottom of the economic ladder, but everyone in the lower half has a lesser chance than those above, and all the more so compared to those near the top. Yet the extent to which one is disadvantaged by a lower position depends significantly on the degree of difference in economic status. In more equal societies, the inequality of opportunity is significantly lower than in highly unequal societies.\nNowhere is this more obvious or more damaging than in the political arena. Those at the top end of the distribution can and do use their wealth and income to gain disproportionate influence over government at all levels, not least in democratic societies. Justice Louis Brandeis famously declared that, \u201cWe can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can\u2019t have both.\u201d The growing concentration of wealth in affluent capitalist nations has been an important reason for the change in the distributive impact of governmental economic policies that I noted above. Since the late 1970s, governments in most [of] the affluent capitalist nations are no longer restraining the natural tendency of capitalist economic growth to generate growing inequality; in many cases \u2014 notably the U.S. \u2014 they are aggravating it.\nAccording to the Oxfam report, the rich pay less taxes than the poor. Will taxing the rich reduce inequality?\nIn most countries the rich pay lower taxes than the poor, as a percentage of their income; but they pay considerably more taxes in dollar terms, because even a lower rate of taxation on income delivers a lot more in tax proceeds when applied to much higher levels of income. (The same is true of taxes on wealth.)\nIncreasing the rate of taxation on the rich \u2014 whether on income or wealth \u2014 would\ncertainly reduce income inequality, measured after taxes (which is what is relevant to one\u2019s standard of living). But it is not the only way to achieve this goal. Other ways to do so are to reduce the rate of taxation on the poor, or for the government to set up programs that benefit everybody without regard to their income or wealth \u2014 like a national health program \u2014 or that provide benefits that are geared to aid the less well-off.\nIf inequality is not inevitable, what policy options are available in the age of globalization to reduce the gap between haves and have-nots?\nThere are many well-known policies that could help reduce the gap. I\u2019ll mention just a few \u2014 starting with economic measures that have been advocated by many on the left and implemented at some times and in some places by progressive governments. 1. Raise taxes on wealth \u2014 especially in its largely unproductive forms, such as inherited wealth and wealth resulting from the appreciation of land value; 2. Work toward ending the tax havens and secret bank accounts that have enabled the world\u2019s richest people to evade taxes and accountability for their financial operations; 3. Raise marginal tax rates on high incomes; 4. Use the revenue from greater tax receipts to improve public services, such as education, medical care, and transportation \u2014 especially for poorer communities; 5. Step up enforcement of anti-concentration and anti-monopoly laws and regulations, and; 6. Enable workers to have greater influence over their workplace conditions, both through stronger unions and through representation on corporate governing boards.\nImplementation of such policies requires that movements responsive to the needs of the great majority of people who are not wealthy succeed in attaining political power.

In order to prevail in the Senate, four Republicans would have to defy Trump. If the bill passes both houses of Congress, Trump has pledged to veto it and there is little chance Congress could muster the two-thirds necessary to override his veto.</p>\n<p>In the likely event the legislature fails to void Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; declaration, the judicial branch will have the opportunity to check and balance the executive. Six lawsuits have already been filed in federal courts around the country. They quote Trump&rsquo;s own words to demonstrate that even he doesn&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a bona fide emergency. The suits claim Trump violated the Constitution&rsquo;s Separation of Powers mandate by circumventing the will of Congress, which has rejected Trump&rsquo;s $5.7 billion demand for his wall. And they allege violation of the National Environmental Policy Act.</p>\n<aside> <p>Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.</p>  </aside>\n<p>The Protect Democracy Project, which filed the lawsuit in <em><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5745225-1-Complaint-20190220.html#document/p1\">El Paso County &amp; Border Network for Human Rights v. Trump</a></em>, noted that courts traditionally defer to a president&rsquo;s claims that national security is under threat. &ldquo;But no such deference is owed to the executive here, where the president is violating statutes and usurping the legislative branch&rsquo;s role.&rdquo; The lawsuit, which was filed in the Western District of Texas, argues, &ldquo;[H]aving seized the power of the legislative branch to make law and spend federal funds, the president may not attempt to sideline the judicial branch by arguing that it cannot interpret and apply the law.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On February 15, after months of wrangling and a 35-day government shutdown during which Trump held the country hostage, Congress passed the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-joint-resolution/31\">2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act</a> and Trump signed it. The <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/15/trump-national-emergency-declaration-border-wall-spending-bill.html\">bill</a> rejects Trump&rsquo;s demand for $5.7 billion to build his border wall. It allocates $1.375 billion to repair existing border barriers or fencing and build 55 miles of new fencing, using a previously approved design. It forbids wall construction in wildlife areas and parks and requires consent of local officials and a public comment period before construction begins in border cities.</p>\n<p>The same day he signed that legislation, Trump issued a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-southern-border-united-states/\">proclamation</a> declaring a &ldquo;national emergency.&rdquo; It states:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>The current situation at the southern border presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency. The southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Trump also published a statement titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trumps-border-security-victory/\">President Donald J. Trump&rsquo;s Border Security Victory</a>&rdquo; specifying how he intends to repurpose money that Congress has already allocated to pay for his wall. He plans to pilfer $3.6 billion from military construction projects, $2.5 billion from counterdrug enforcement, and $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund.</p>\n<p>Although Trump has been demanding that Congress allocate $5.7 billion for his wall, he now asserts authority to redirect funds that, when combined with the $1.375 billion Congress did approve, total almost $8.1 billion.</p>\n<p>The lawsuits claim that by repurposing funds Congress has already designated, Trump has exceeded his constitutional and statutory powers.</p>\n<h2><strong>No Bona Fide Emergency</strong></h2>\n<p>The National Emergencies Act, enacted to limit the president&rsquo;s authority to declare a national emergency, requires a real emergency. Trump&rsquo;s claim that the entry of criminals, drugs and gangs at the southern border constitutes a national security threat is spurious.</p>\n<p>When he announced in the Rose Garden that he was declaring an &ldquo;emergency,&rdquo; Trump admitted there was no real emergency. He <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-national-security-humanitarian-crisis-southern-border/\">said</a>, &ldquo;I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn&rsquo;t need to do this. But I&rsquo;d rather do it much faster.&rdquo; Trump was expressing a personal preference, not describing a national emergency.</p>\n<p>Sixteen states filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California. In <em><a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MIAG/2019/02/18/file_attachments/1157191/COMPLAINT%20FOR%20DECLARATORY%20AND%20INJUNCTIVE%20RELIEF.pdf\">California v. Trump</a></em>, the states marshaled data demonstrating that migration on the southern border does not constitute a national threat.</p>\n<p>On February 25, a bipartisan group of 58 former national security and homeland security officials <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/former-senior-united-states-officials-national-emergency-declaration-february-2019.pdf\">issued a Joint Declaration</a>, stating, &ldquo;there is no factual basis for the declaration of a national emergency&rdquo; at the southern border. They wrote:</p>\n<ul><li>Illegal border crossings are at near 40-year lows;</li> <li>There is no documented terrorist or national security emergency;</li> <li>There is no emergency related to violent crime;</li> <li>There is no human or drug trafficking emergency that can be addressed by a wall;</li> <li>This proclamation will only exacerbate the humanitarian concerns that do exist;</li> <li>There is no basis for circumventing the appropriations process;</li> <li>The situation at the border does not require the use of the armed forces, and a wall is unnecessary to support the use of the armed forces; and</li> <li>Redirecting funds for the &ldquo;national emergency&rdquo; will undermine U.S. national security interests &ldquo;by needlessly pulling resources from Department of Defense programs that are responsible for keeping our troops and our country safe and running effectively.&rdquo;</li> </ul>\n<p>On January 29, the Director of National Intelligence issued a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf\">Worldwide Threat Assessment</a>.&rdquo; That report makes no mention of any security threat posed by migrant caravans at the southern border. It states that most asylum applicants are &ldquo;fleeing violence at home.&rdquo; On the same day, the directors of the Office of National Intelligence, the FBI and the CIA <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y45voevk\">testified</a> about global threats at a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee. None of them described a security crisis at the southern border.</p>\n<p>A 2018 <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y93n5fes\">State Department report</a> found &ldquo;no credible evidence indicating that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico, worked with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into the United States.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Several studies have determined that undocumented immigrants do not commit crimes at a greater rate than U.S. citizens. For example, a <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/ycyzsf27\">2018 study in <em>Criminology</em></a> concluded that &ldquo;undocumented immigration does not increase violence.&rdquo; In fact, &ldquo;increases in the undocumented immigrant population within states are associated with significant decreases in the prevalence of violence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And the overwhelming majority of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl smuggled into the United States comes in <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics\">through official ports of entry</a> rather than through illicit border crossings.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a border wall could actually increase the clout of the drug cartels. A wall would squeeze smaller drug operators &ldquo;and force them into the hands of the large organizations, increasing their income and power,&rdquo; Don Winslow <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/commentary/sd-utbg-border-wall-trump-drugs-winslow-20190221-htmlstory.html\">wrote</a> in <em>The San Diego Union-Tribune</em><em>.</em> &ldquo;The wall would not cost the cartels money. It would make them more money.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2><strong>Violation of Separation of Powers </strong></h2>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MIAG/2019/02/18/file_attachments/1157191/COMPLAINT%20FOR%20DECLARATORY%20AND%20INJUNCTIVE%20RELIEF.pdf\">California v. Trump</a></em> argues that Trump&rsquo;s scheme to secure money for his wall constitutes a &ldquo;flagrant disregard of fundamental separation of powers principles engrained in the United States Constitution.&rdquo; Congress has the power to make the laws and the power of the purse. The president has the duty to faithfully carry out the law.</p>\n<p>The Lawmaking Power (Article I, Section 1) provides, &ldquo;All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) says, &ldquo;The Congress shall have Power to &hellip; provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Appropriations Clause (Article I, Section 9, Clause 7) states, &ldquo;No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Presentment Clause (Article I, Section 7, Clause 2) requires that all bills passed by both houses of Congress must be presented to the president for signature. The president then has only two options. He can sign the bill or veto it.</p>\n<p>The Take Care Clause (Article II, Section 3) says that the president &ldquo;shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In <em><a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/343/579.html\">Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952)</a></em><em>, </em>the Supreme Court said that when the president seeks to circumvent the expressed or implied will of Congress, &ldquo;his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter.&rdquo; Presidential claim to such power &ldquo;must be scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake is the equilibrium established by our constitutional system.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to authorize expenditures of federal funds. Congress has specifically considered and refused to appropriate the $5.7 billion Trump is demanding for his border wall. By using the pretext of a national emergency to steal money Congress already assigned to other purposes, Trump is circumventing the will of Congress. No president has ever declared a national emergency as an end run around Congress after it rejected his spending demand.</p>\n<p>Trump is claiming the right to take $3.6 billion away from military construction projects, under <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/2808\">Tit. 10 USC sec. 2808</a>; $2.5 billion away from counterdrug enforcement, under <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/284\">Tit. 10 USC sec. 284</a>; and $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund.</p>\n<h2><strong>Diverting Money From Military Construction (Section 2808)</strong></h2>\n<p>Trump cannot lawfully invoke section 2808. It allows a president who claims an emergency that &ldquo;requires the use of the armed forces&rdquo; to <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/2808\">divert funds</a> that have not been &ldquo;obligated&rdquo; and use them for construction projects &ldquo;necessary to support&rdquo; the military.</p>\n<p>The funds Trump seeks to usurp have already been obligated to other purposes. Building a border wall does not constitute &ldquo;military construction,&rdquo; which must support a military installation.</p>\n<p>In <em>El Paso County</em>, the Protect Democracy Project asserts, &ldquo;Since 1996, hundreds of miles of southern border barriers have been built without any use of the armed forces. Likewise, policing the southern border has been the function of the Department of Homeland Security, and prior to that the Immigration and Naturalization Service, not the military.&rdquo; Moreover, the use of the military to enforce domestic law is <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/trumps-military-deployment-to-the-us-mexico-border-is-illegal/\">prohibited by the Posse Comitatus Act</a>, unless Congress makes exceptions, which it has not done here.</p>\n<p>The civilian construction of a border wall does not require the use of the military, nor is it &ldquo;necessary to support&rdquo; the military. &ldquo;The Proclamation turns the statute on its head, seeking to mobilize the armed forces to engage in a civil construction project; not to engage in a construction project necessary to support the mobilization of the armed forces,&rdquo; Project Democracy argues.</p>\n<h2><strong>Diverting Money From </strong><strong>Counterdrug Enforcement (Section 284)</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/284\">Section 284</a> does not allow shifting the money Congress has allocated for counterdrug operations to construct a border wall. Use of those funds is limited to &ldquo;roads, fences and installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors.&rdquo; The entire 2,000-mile southern border is not a &ldquo;drug smuggling corridor.&rdquo; Money under this section can be used for repair and maintenance of equipment, and transporting personnel. Small-scale construction projects are permitted, but not border wall construction.</p>\n<h2><strong>Diverting Money From the </strong><strong>Treasury Forfeiture Fund </strong></h2>\n<p>The Treasury Forfeiture Fund can only be used for specific purposes, including paying law enforcement officers, consultants and informants, and upgrading law enforcement vehicles. They do not include construction.</p>\n<h2><strong>National Environmental Policy Act</strong></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-55\">National Environmental Policy Act</a> mandates the preparation of environmental impact statements for major federal projects that &ldquo;significantly affect the quality of the human environment.&rdquo; There has been no environmental impact statement here. Yet Stephen Miller said people <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a26359194/national-emergency-border-trump/\">would be &ldquo;shocked&rdquo;</a> at the speed with which the administration will build the wall.</p>\n<p>Several environmental organizations filed litigation to overturn Trump&rsquo;s declaration. The ACLU <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/sierra-club-v-trump-complaint?redirect=sierra-club-v-trump-complaint-declaratory-and-injunctive-relief\">filed a lawsuit</a> in the Northern District of California on behalf of the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition. Another suit <a href=\"https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/border_wall/pdfs/ED-Complaint.pdf\">was filed in the District of Columbia</a> by the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, and the Animal Legal Defense Fund.</p>\n<p>A 2017 study by the Center for Biological Diversity found that Trump&rsquo;s border wall threatens 93 endangered and threatened species, including jaguars, ocelots, Mexican gray wolves and cactus ferruginous pygmy owls. &ldquo;The border wall won&rsquo;t be effective at stopping people seeking a better life from getting to this country, but it <em>will </em>destroy habitat and divide wildlife populations,&rdquo; Noah Greenwald, the center&rsquo;s endangered species director, <a href=\"https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2017/border-wall-05-15-2017.php\">noted</a> in a statement. &ldquo;Building a wall across the entirety of the border would cause massive damage to one of the most biologically diverse regions in North America.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Beyond jeopardizing wildlife, endangered species and public lands, the U.S.-Mexico border wall is part of a larger strategy of ongoing border militarization that damages human rights, civil liberties, native lands, local businesses and international relations,&rdquo; the <a href=\"https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2019/border-wall-02-16-2019.php\">Center for Biodiversity said</a> in a statement announcing the filing of its lawsuit. &ldquo;The border wall impedes the natural migrations of people and wildlife that are essential to healthy diversity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Public Citizen Litigation Group <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/sites/default/files/emergency_declaration_complaint.pdf\">filed a lawsuit</a> in the District of Columbia on behalf of Frontera Audubon Society and three Texas landowners whose land would be seized to build the wall.</p>\n<p>And Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/storage.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/15182803/OLC-FOIA-Complaint.pdf\">sued the Department of Justice in the District of Columbia</a>, alleging that the Freedom of Information Act requires the Office of Legal Counsel to disclose its opinions about the power of the president to declare a national emergency, and specifically to build a wall or barrier on the southern border.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Supreme Court will likely decide whether Trump&rsquo;s action is illegal. He is counting on the high court to affirm his &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; declaration like it upheld his rewritten Muslim Ban. But Chief Justice John Roberts, though conservative, is mindful of the legacy of his Court. He may well vote to overturn Trump&rsquo;s unprecedented end run around Congress and uphold the Constitution&rsquo;s separation of powers mandate.</p>\n<p>There is much at stake. Congress should do its duty to check and balance this out-of-control executive. Failing that, it is up to the courts to halt Trump&rsquo;s illegal assertion of executive power.</p>\n<aside><a href=\"https://truthout.org/donate\"> <p>As attacks on women&rsquo;s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we&rsquo;re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever. </p> <p>At Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship. <b>But this is only sustainable if we have your support.</b> If you like what you&rsquo;re reading or just value what we do, will you take a few seconds to contribute to our work? </p>  Donate Now </a></aside>",

                "text": "Today, the House of Representatives is poised to adopt a resolution overturning Donald Trump\u2019s trumped-up \u201cnational emergency\u201d proclamation, in which he claims authority to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall at the southern border.\nThe National Emergencies Act requires Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring the House resolution to a vote within 18 days. In order to prevail in the Senate, four Republicans would have to defy Trump. If the bill passes both houses of Congress, Trump has pledged to veto it and there is little chance Congress could muster the two-thirds necessary to override his veto.\nIn the likely event the legislature fails to void Trump\u2019s \u201cemergency\u201d declaration, the judicial branch will have the opportunity to check and balance the executive. Six lawsuits have already been filed in federal courts around the country. They quote Trump\u2019s own words to demonstrate that even he doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s a bona fide emergency. The suits claim Trump violated the Constitution\u2019s Separation of Powers mandate by circumventing the will of Congress, which has rejected Trump\u2019s $5.7 billion demand for his wall. And they allege violation of the National Environmental Policy Act.\nGet the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.\nThe Protect Democracy Project, which filed the lawsuit in El Paso County & Border Network for Human Rights v. Trump, noted that courts traditionally defer to a president\u2019s claims that national security is under threat. \u201cBut no such deference is owed to the executive here, where the president is violating statutes and usurping the legislative branch\u2019s role.\u201d The lawsuit, which was filed in the Western District of Texas, argues, \u201c[H]aving seized the power of the legislative branch to make law and spend federal funds, the president may not attempt to sideline the judicial branch by arguing that it cannot interpret and apply the law.\u201d\nOn February 15, after months of wrangling and a 35-day government shutdown during which Trump held the country hostage, Congress passed the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act and Trump signed it. The bill rejects Trump\u2019s demand for $5.7 billion to build his border wall. It allocates $1.375 billion to repair existing border barriers or fencing and build 55 miles of new fencing, using a previously approved design. It forbids wall construction in wildlife areas and parks and requires consent of local officials and a public comment period before construction begins in border cities.\nThe same day he signed that legislation, Trump issued a proclamation declaring a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d It states:\nThe current situation at the southern border presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency. The southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics.\nTrump also published a statement titled \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump\u2019s Border Security Victory\u201d specifying how he intends to repurpose money that Congress has already allocated to pay for his wall. He plans to pilfer $3.6 billion from military construction projects, $2.5 billion from counterdrug enforcement, and $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund.\nAlthough Trump has been demanding that Congress allocate $5.7 billion for his wall, he now asserts authority to redirect funds that, when combined with the $1.375 billion Congress did approve, total almost $8.1 billion.\nThe lawsuits claim that by repurposing funds Congress has already designated, Trump has exceeded his constitutional and statutory powers.\nNo Bona Fide Emergency\nThe National Emergencies Act, enacted to limit the president\u2019s authority to declare a national emergency, requires a real emergency. Trump\u2019s claim that the entry of criminals, drugs and gangs at the southern border constitutes a national security threat is spurious.\nWhen he announced in the Rose Garden that he was declaring an \u201cemergency,\u201d Trump admitted there was no real emergency. He said, \u201cI could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn\u2019t need to do this. But I\u2019d rather do it much faster.\u201d Trump was expressing a personal preference, not describing a national emergency.\nSixteen states filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California. In California v. Trump, the states marshaled data demonstrating that migration on the southern border does not constitute a national threat.\nOn February 25, a bipartisan group of 58 former national security and homeland security officials issued a Joint Declaration, stating, \u201cthere is no factual basis for the declaration of a national emergency\u201d at the southern border. They wrote:\nIllegal border crossings are at near 40-year lows;\nThere is no documented terrorist or national security emergency;\nThere is no emergency related to violent crime;\nThere is no human or drug trafficking emergency that can be addressed by a wall;\nThis proclamation will only exacerbate the humanitarian concerns that do exist;\nThere is no basis for circumventing the appropriations process;\nThe situation at the border does not require the use of the armed forces, and a wall is unnecessary to support the use of the armed forces; and\nRedirecting funds for the \u201cnational emergency\u201d will undermine U.S. national security interests \u201cby needlessly pulling resources from Department of Defense programs that are responsible for keeping our troops and our country safe and running effectively.\u201d\nOn January 29, the Director of National Intelligence issued a \u201cWorldwide Threat Assessment.\u201d That report makes no mention of any security threat posed by migrant caravans at the southern border. It states that most asylum applicants are \u201cfleeing violence at home.\u201d On the same day, the directors of the Office of National Intelligence, the FBI and the CIA testified about global threats at a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee. None of them described a security crisis at the southern border.\nA 2018 State Department report found \u201cno credible evidence indicating that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico, worked with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into the United States.\u201d\nSeveral studies have determined that undocumented immigrants do not commit crimes at a greater rate than U.S. citizens. For example, a 2018 study in Criminology concluded that \u201cundocumented immigration does not increase violence.\u201d In fact, \u201cincreases in the undocumented immigrant population within states are associated with significant decreases in the prevalence of violence.\u201d\nAnd the overwhelming majority of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl smuggled into the United States comes in through official ports of entry rather than through illicit border crossings.\nMoreover, a border wall could actually increase the clout of the drug cartels. A wall would squeeze smaller drug operators \u201cand force them into the hands of the large organizations, increasing their income and power,\u201d Don Winslow wrote in The San Diego Union-Tribune. \u201cThe wall would not cost the cartels money. It would make them more money.\u201d\nViolation of Separation of Powers\nCalifornia v. Trump argues that Trump\u2019s scheme to secure money for his wall constitutes a \u201cflagrant disregard of fundamental separation of powers principles engrained in the United States Constitution.\u201d Congress has the power to make the laws and the power of the purse. The president has the duty to faithfully carry out the law.\nThe Lawmaking Power (Article I, Section 1) provides, \u201cAll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress.\u201d\nThe Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) says, \u201cThe Congress shall have Power to \u2026 provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.\u201d\nThe Appropriations Clause (Article I, Section 9, Clause 7) states, \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\u201d\nThe Presentment Clause (Article I, Section 7, Clause 2) requires that all bills passed by both houses of Congress must be presented to the president for signature. The president then has only two options. He can sign the bill or veto it.\nThe Take Care Clause (Article II, Section 3) says that the president \u201cshall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d\nIn Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952), the Supreme Court said that when the president seeks to circumvent the expressed or implied will of Congress, \u201chis power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter.\u201d Presidential claim to such power \u201cmust be scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake is the equilibrium established by our constitutional system.\u201d\nThe Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to authorize expenditures of federal funds. Congress has specifically considered and refused to appropriate the $5.7 billion Trump is demanding for his border wall. By using the pretext of a national emergency to steal money Congress already assigned to other purposes, Trump is circumventing the will of Congress. No president has ever declared a national emergency as an end run around Congress after it rejected his spending demand.\nTrump is claiming the right to take $3.6 billion away from military construction projects, under Tit. 10 USC sec. 2808; $2.5 billion away from counterdrug enforcement, under Tit. 10 USC sec. 284; and $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund.\nDiverting Money From Military Construction (Section 2808)\nTrump cannot lawfully invoke section 2808. It allows a president who claims an emergency that \u201crequires the use of the armed forces\u201d to divert funds that have not been \u201cobligated\u201d and use them for construction projects \u201cnecessary to support\u201d the military.\nThe funds Trump seeks to usurp have already been obligated to other purposes. Building a border wall does not constitute \u201cmilitary construction,\u201d which must support a military installation.\nIn El Paso County, the Protect Democracy Project asserts, \u201cSince 1996, hundreds of miles of southern border barriers have been built without any use of the armed forces. Likewise, policing the southern border has been the function of the Department of Homeland Security, and prior to that the Immigration and Naturalization Service, not the military.\u201d Moreover, the use of the military to enforce domestic law is prohibited by the Posse Comitatus Act, unless Congress makes exceptions, which it has not done here.\nThe civilian construction of a border wall does not require the use of the military, nor is it \u201cnecessary to support\u201d the military. \u201cThe Proclamation turns the statute on its head, seeking to mobilize the armed forces to engage in a civil construction project; not to engage in a construction project necessary to support the mobilization of the armed forces,\u201d Project Democracy argues.\nDiverting Money From Counterdrug Enforcement (Section 284)\nSection 284 does not allow shifting the money Congress has allocated for counterdrug operations to construct a border wall. Use of those funds is limited to \u201croads, fences and installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors.\u201d The entire 2,000-mile southern border is not a \u201cdrug smuggling corridor.\u201d Money under this section can be used for repair and maintenance of equipment, and transporting personnel. Small-scale construction projects are permitted, but not border wall construction.\nDiverting Money From the Treasury Forfeiture Fund\nThe Treasury Forfeiture Fund can only be used for specific purposes, including paying law enforcement officers, consultants and informants, and upgrading law enforcement vehicles. They do not include construction.\nNational Environmental Policy Act\nThe National Environmental Policy Act mandates the preparation of environmental impact statements for major federal projects that \u201csignificantly affect the quality of the human environment.\u201d There has been no environmental impact statement here. Yet Stephen Miller said people would be \u201cshocked\u201d at the speed with which the administration will build the wall.\nSeveral environmental organizations filed litigation to overturn Trump\u2019s declaration. The ACLU filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California on behalf of the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition. Another suit was filed in the District of Columbia by the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, and the Animal Legal Defense Fund.\nA 2017 study by the Center for Biological Diversity found that Trump\u2019s border wall threatens 93 endangered and threatened species, including jaguars, ocelots, Mexican gray wolves and cactus ferruginous pygmy owls. \u201cThe border wall won\u2019t be effective at stopping people seeking a better life from getting to this country, but it will destroy habitat and divide wildlife populations,\u201d Noah Greenwald, the center\u2019s endangered species director, noted in a statement. \u201cBuilding a wall across the entirety of the border would cause massive damage to one of the most biologically diverse regions in North America.\u201d\n\u201cBeyond jeopardizing wildlife, endangered species and public lands, the U.S.-Mexico border wall is part of a larger strategy of ongoing border militarization that damages human rights, civil liberties, native lands, local businesses and international relations,\u201d the Center for Biodiversity said in a statement announcing the filing of its lawsuit. \u201cThe border wall impedes the natural migrations of people and wildlife that are essential to healthy diversity.\u201d\nPublic Citizen Litigation Group filed a lawsuit in the District of Columbia on behalf of Frontera Audubon Society and three Texas landowners whose land would be seized to build the wall.\nAnd Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued the Department of Justice in the District of Columbia, alleging that the Freedom of Information Act requires the Office of Legal Counsel to disclose its opinions about the power of the president to declare a national emergency, and specifically to build a wall or barrier on the southern border.\nUltimately, the Supreme Court will likely decide whether Trump\u2019s action is illegal. He is counting on the high court to affirm his \u201cemergency\u201d declaration like it upheld his rewritten Muslim Ban. But Chief Justice John Roberts, though conservative, is mindful of the legacy of his Court. He may well vote to overturn Trump\u2019s unprecedented end run around Congress and uphold the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers mandate.\nThere is much at stake. Congress should do its duty to check and balance this out-of-control executive. Failing that, it is up to the courts to halt Trump\u2019s illegal assertion of executive power.\nAs attacks on women\u2019s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we\u2019re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever.\nAt Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship.

                "html": "<p>On Monday, the Trump administration released full details of its 2020 budget request, the general outlines of which were released last week. The initial release <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/trump-budget-would-cut-spending-for-nearly-every-agency-except-pentagon/\">called for cuts to nearly every federal agency</a>, with deep cuts to the State Department, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and others. Only the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Veterans&rsquo; Affairs would receive substantial increases.</p>\n<p>With this week&rsquo;s release, the administration provided a fuller picture of its anti-government, pro-military vision for the U.S. The long list of cuts targets programs for the poor, middle-income Americans, the environment and peacekeeping.</p>\n<h2>Cuts Target the Poor, People of Color and Students</h2>\n<p>Perhaps more than any other group, this budget would hurt poor Americans, particularly people of color.</p>\n<aside> <p>Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.</p>  </aside>\n<p>Among anti-poverty programs under threat, the budget would make it harder for kids to qualify for free school lunch, institute new work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), otherwise known as food stamps, and replace some SNAP benefits with paternalistic &ldquo;harvest food&rdquo; boxes that reduce food choice for recipients (and which, contrary to the branding, would consist of foods such as shelf-stable milk and canned fruit). It further decimates the already weakened Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, commonly known as welfare, by reducing its budget, limiting eligibility, and making work requirements more central by limiting states&rsquo; flexibility in how to use funds.</p>\n<p>Services for poor people face elimination and cuts, too: Before- and after-school care provided through the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program; low-income heating and cooling assistance; and the Legal Services Corporation, more commonly known by its Legal Aid programs that provide legal representation to low-income Americans, would all be eliminated entirely.</p>\n<p>People of color, and especially those with <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/one-third-of-native-american-and-african-american-children-are-still-in-poverty/\">higher poverty rates</a>, are targets of the budget&rsquo;s austerity. The request eliminates job training funds through the Labor Department&rsquo;s Indian and Native American Program and community development funds through the Indian Community Development Block Grant, and cuts affordable housing grants to Native American tribes and Alaska Native villages. It targets immigrants by eliminating the Labor Department&rsquo;s Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Program, which aims to increase employment and earnings for migrant and seasonal workers by providing services like job training and housing assistance. The budget would also require that all applicants show a valid social security number to claim tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Care Tax Credit &mdash; a requirement that intentionally and disproportionately targets undocumented immigrants who pay income taxes.</p>\n<p>The proposal also has it out for students and young people. It would cut funding for the federal work-study program that primarily benefits lower- or middle-income college students and the Job Corps program that provides early work experience and training to 50,000 low-income and disproportionately Black youth each year. It would also eliminate the public service loan forgiveness program and subsidized student loans for college, which help limit the interest students must pay. There are currently <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/student/portfolio\">29 million</a> subsidized student loans on the books, worth a total of $277 billion.</p>\n<h2>Medicaid for the Few</h2>\n<p>The budget process that kicks off with the release of the president&rsquo;s budget request and ends with the passage of a budget by Congress doesn&rsquo;t actually set budgets for Medicaid and Medicare, but it&rsquo;s frequently used by presidents to express their intentions for those programs.</p>\n<aside>Expected Medicaid spending of $1.5 trillion would be replaced with only $1.2 trillion in funding for the new system.</aside>\n<p>Trump took the opportunity with this budget release to make clear his preference for a much-reduced Medicaid program in particular. The proposal would end the expansion of Medicaid made possible by the Affordable Care Act and under which <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/medicaid-expansion-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">17 million Americans gained health insurance</a>, and would repeal both the individual mandate for health insurance and the health insurance subsidies from the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>It would further replace traditional Medicaid spending, which can expand to meet need, with &ldquo;market-based&rdquo; health spending set to a predetermined level that would rise at a lower rate than health care spending, so that the buying power of the program would decrease over time, resulting in inevitable loss of insurance, health benefits or both to current Medicaid recipients. Expected Medicaid spending of $1.5 trillion would be replaced with only $1.2 trillion in funding for the new system.</p>\n<h2>Damaging States, Cities and Towns</h2>\n<p>On average, states get about <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gov-finances.html\">30 percent of their operating funds</a> from the federal government, meaning that federal spending provides the bedrock for many local government programs, including crucial investments in schools and economic development. The Trump proposal puts an end to many programs that support states, regions and cities.</p>\n<aside>The budget illustrates the administration&rsquo;s disdain for programs that aim to prevent war and address the root causes of conflict.</aside>\n<p>The budget includes a proposal to shut down the Economic Development Administration, which provides local grants for everything from local economic planning to infrastructure investment and disaster aid, giving it a total budget of $30 million to &ldquo;conduct an orderly closure.&rdquo; It would also end the Community Development Block Grant program, which provides local aid to support adequate affordable housing and to create job opportunities for poor and lower-income residents; the similar Community Services Block Grant program, which provides grants to cities, states and other localities to address poverty and homelessness and served nearly <a href=\"https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/resource/csbg-fact-sheet\">17 million people</a> in 2017; and the HOME program, which has helped build and preserve <a href=\"https://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50954/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=18113\">well over 1 million affordable homes</a> throughout the country.</p>\n<p>The shuttering of programs designed to place control over economic development and poverty alleviation in local hands is particularly ironic, given that a key rationale for the administration&rsquo;s proposals to dismantle Medicaid and other programs is to put government spending back under local control.</p>\n<h2>Peacekeeping and International Order</h2>\n<p>Despite claiming concern over federal deficits, the list of major cuts has not so much as one entry for the agency that takes up more than half of the $1 trillion that Congress allocates each year: the Department of Defense. The budget illustrates the administration&rsquo;s disdain for programs that aim to prevent war and address the root causes of conflict, in contrast to its enthusiasm for displays of military might.</p>\n<aside>The budget gives the Pentagon a raise nearly as much as the entire proposed budget for the State Department and international aid.</aside>\n<p>While the military budget gets a boost, the proposal includes plenty of cuts related to diplomacy, foreign aid and peacekeeping. It includes proposed cuts to the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development of $3 billion for economic aid and an additional $1.7 billion in food aid to foreign countries.</p>\n<p>The budget would also cut U.S. contributions to UN peacekeeping from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $1.1 billion in 2020. It would cut in half the $39 million budget for the tiny U.S. Institute for Peace, a federally funded nonprofit that works internationally to prevent violent conflict, sending the organization begging to other government departments, including the Department of Defense, to fund its work. With a foreign policy framework and Pentagon budget that already make militarization the first response to crises worldwide, forcing a peace agency to apply to the Pentagon for funds invites further militarization of our foreign policy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the budget gives the Pentagon a 5 percent raise worth $33 billion &mdash; nearly as much as the entire proposed budget for the State Department and international aid.</p>\n<h2>Energy and Climate</h2>\n<p>The budget saves some of its worst cuts for energy and science programs. The budget eliminates or cuts the Department of Energy&rsquo;s Advanced Research Projects program, Applied Energy Program, and energy technology loans, all of which help bring new energy technologies to market, on the justification that private companies are best positioned to decide what to sell. The problem with such thinking is that it ignores non-profit-based rationales for investing in new energy technologies &ndash; rationales such as climate change. The administration would also defund renewable energy and energy efficiency programs like tribal loans for the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures, and the Energy Start program, among others.</p>\n<aside>The budget proposes to privatize energy grid infrastructure owned by the federal government, and would allow private grid owners to charge higher energy rates.</aside>\n<p>The budget also proposes to privatize energy grid infrastructure now owned by the federal government, and would allow private grid owners to charge higher energy rates. Federally owned power utilities are currently limited to charging customers for the cost of the electricity. Part of a disturbing move toward privatizing pubic infrastructure, the proposal would also privatize Washington, D.C.&rsquo;s publicly owned water supply.</p>\n<h2>Profound Damage to Our Way of Life</h2>\n<p>From our health care to education to the very water we drink, the Trump budget proposes to shut down programs meant to assist those without the means to do so meet their basic needs in favor of more military spending and power company fortunes.</p>\n<p>The good news is that a president&rsquo;s budget does not have the force of law. Many of its measures stand no chance under Democratic control of the House of Representatives, and many of the proposed cuts are unpopular even among Republican legislators. Yet each time cuts come up for consideration, programs are at risk, even if the eventual cuts are less than what the administration has proposed. Each of these proposals must get through Congress before it becomes a reality, and now is the time for Americans to let their representatives know what kind of budget they want to see.</p>\n<aside><a href=\"https://truthout.org/donate\"><h4>The stakes have never been higher</h4> <p>As attacks on women&rsquo;s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we&rsquo;re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever. </p> <p>At Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship. <b>But this is only sustainable if we have your support.</b> If you like what you&rsquo;re reading or just value what we do, will you take a few seconds to contribute to our work? </p>  Donate Now </a></aside>\n<aside>     <p>Lindsay Koshgarian is program director of the National Priorities Project, working for a federal budget that prioritizes peace, shared prosperity and economic opportunity for all.</p>     </aside>",

                "text": "On Monday, the Trump administration released full details of its 2020 budget request, the general outlines of which were released last week. The initial release called for cuts to nearly every federal agency, with deep cuts to the State Department, the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and others. Only the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs would receive substantial increases.\nWith this week\u2019s release, the administration provided a fuller picture of its anti-government, pro-military vision for the U.S. The long list of cuts targets programs for the poor, middle-income Americans, the environment and peacekeeping.\nCuts Target the Poor, People of Color and Students\nPerhaps more than any other group, this budget would hurt poor Americans, particularly people of color.\nGet the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.\nAmong anti-poverty programs under threat, the budget would make it harder for kids to qualify for free school lunch, institute new work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), otherwise known as food stamps, and replace some SNAP benefits with paternalistic \u201charvest food\u201d boxes that reduce food choice for recipients (and which, contrary to the branding, would consist of foods such as shelf-stable milk and canned fruit). It further decimates the already weakened Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, commonly known as welfare, by reducing its budget, limiting eligibility, and making work requirements more central by limiting states\u2019 flexibility in how to use funds.\nServices for poor people face elimination and cuts, too: Before- and after-school care provided through the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program; low-income heating and cooling assistance; and the Legal Services Corporation, more commonly known by its Legal Aid programs that provide legal representation to low-income Americans, would all be eliminated entirely.\nPeople of color, and especially those with higher poverty rates, are targets of the budget\u2019s austerity. The request eliminates job training funds through the Labor Department\u2019s Indian and Native American Program and community development funds through the Indian Community Development Block Grant, and cuts affordable housing grants to Native American tribes and Alaska Native villages. It targets immigrants by eliminating the Labor Department\u2019s Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Program, which aims to increase employment and earnings for migrant and seasonal workers by providing services like job training and housing assistance. The budget would also require that all applicants show a valid social security number to claim tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Care Tax Credit \u2014 a requirement that intentionally and disproportionately targets undocumented immigrants who pay income taxes.\nThe proposal also has it out for students and young people. It would cut funding for the federal work-study program that primarily benefits lower- or middle-income college students and the Job Corps program that provides early work experience and training to 50,000 low-income and disproportionately Black youth each year. It would also eliminate the public service loan forgiveness program and subsidized student loans for college, which help limit the interest students must pay. There are currently 29 million subsidized student loans on the books, worth a total of $277 billion.\nMedicaid for the Few\nThe budget process that kicks off with the release of the president\u2019s budget request and ends with the passage of a budget by Congress doesn\u2019t actually set budgets for Medicaid and Medicare, but it\u2019s frequently used by presidents to express their intentions for those programs.\nExpected Medicaid spending of $1.5 trillion would be replaced with only $1.2 trillion in funding for the new system.\nTrump took the opportunity with this budget release to make clear his preference for a much-reduced Medicaid program in particular. The proposal would end the expansion of Medicaid made possible by the Affordable Care Act and under which 17 million Americans gained health insurance, and would repeal both the individual mandate for health insurance and the health insurance subsidies from the Affordable Care Act.\nIt would further replace traditional Medicaid spending, which can expand to meet need, with \u201cmarket-based\u201d health spending set to a predetermined level that would rise at a lower rate than health care spending, so that the buying power of the program would decrease over time, resulting in inevitable loss of insurance, health benefits or both to current Medicaid recipients. Expected Medicaid spending of $1.5 trillion would be replaced with only $1.2 trillion in funding for the new system.\nDamaging States, Cities and Towns\nOn average, states get about 30 percent of their operating funds from the federal government, meaning that federal spending provides the bedrock for many local government programs, including crucial investments in schools and economic development. The Trump proposal puts an end to many programs that support states, regions and cities.\nThe budget illustrates the administration\u2019s disdain for programs that aim to prevent war and address the root causes of conflict.\nThe budget includes a proposal to shut down the Economic Development Administration, which provides local grants for everything from local economic planning to infrastructure investment and disaster aid, giving it a total budget of $30 million to \u201cconduct an orderly closure.\u201d It would also end the Community Development Block Grant program, which provides local aid to support adequate affordable housing and to create job opportunities for poor and lower-income residents; the similar Community Services Block Grant program, which provides grants to cities, states and other localities to address poverty and homelessness and served nearly 17 million people in 2017; and the HOME program, which has helped build and preserve well over 1 million affordable homes throughout the country.\nThe shuttering of programs designed to place control over economic development and poverty alleviation in local hands is particularly ironic, given that a key rationale for the administration\u2019s proposals to dismantle Medicaid and other programs is to put government spending back under local control.\nPeacekeeping and International Order\nDespite claiming concern over federal deficits, the list of major cuts has not so much as one entry for the agency that takes up more than half of the $1 trillion that Congress allocates each year: the Department of Defense. The budget illustrates the administration\u2019s disdain for programs that aim to prevent war and address the root causes of conflict, in contrast to its enthusiasm for displays of military might.\nThe budget gives the Pentagon a raise nearly as much as the entire proposed budget for the State Department and international aid.\nWhile the military budget gets a boost, the proposal includes plenty of cuts related to diplomacy, foreign aid and peacekeeping. It includes proposed cuts to the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development of $3 billion for economic aid and an additional $1.7 billion in food aid to foreign countries.\nThe budget would also cut U.S. contributions to UN peacekeeping from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $1.1 billion in 2020. It would cut in half the $39 million budget for the tiny U.S. Institute for Peace, a federally funded nonprofit that works internationally to prevent violent conflict, sending the organization begging to other government departments, including the Department of Defense, to fund its work. With a foreign policy framework and Pentagon budget that already make militarization the first response to crises worldwide, forcing a peace agency to apply to the Pentagon for funds invites further militarization of our foreign policy.\nMeanwhile, the budget gives the Pentagon a 5 percent raise worth $33 billion \u2014 nearly as much as the entire proposed budget for the State Department and international aid.\nEnergy and Climate\nThe budget saves some of its worst cuts for energy and science programs. The budget eliminates or cuts the Department of Energy\u2019s Advanced Research Projects program, Applied Energy Program, and energy technology loans, all of which help bring new energy technologies to market, on the justification that private companies are best positioned to decide what to sell. The problem with such thinking is that it ignores non-profit-based rationales for investing in new energy technologies \u2013 rationales such as climate change. The administration would also defund renewable energy and energy efficiency programs like tribal loans for the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures, and the Energy Start program, among others.\nThe budget proposes to privatize energy grid infrastructure owned by the federal government, and would allow private grid owners to charge higher energy rates.\nThe budget also proposes to privatize energy grid infrastructure now owned by the federal government, and would allow private grid owners to charge higher energy rates. Federally owned power utilities are currently limited to charging customers for the cost of the electricity. Part of a disturbing move toward privatizing pubic infrastructure, the proposal would also privatize Washington, D.C.\u2019s publicly owned water supply.\nProfound Damage to Our Way of Life\nFrom our health care to education to the very water we drink, the Trump budget proposes to shut down programs meant to assist those without the means to do so meet their basic needs in favor of more military spending and power company fortunes.\nThe good news is that a president\u2019s budget does not have the force of law. Many of its measures stand no chance under Democratic control of the House of Representatives, and many of the proposed cuts are unpopular even among Republican legislators. Yet each time cuts come up for consideration, programs are at risk, even if the eventual cuts are less than what the administration has proposed. Each of these proposals must get through Congress before it becomes a reality, and now is the time for Americans to let their representatives know what kind of budget they want to see.\nThe stakes have never been higher\nAs attacks on women\u2019s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we\u2019re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever.\nAt Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship.

If Trump permits myriad new lawsuits to proceed, it would unleash a tsunami of litigation that would harm U.S. companies and punish the Cuban people even more.</p>\n<aside><h2>The stories you care about, right at your fingertips</h2> <p>Get Truthout&rsquo;s daily edition delivered to your inbox.</p>  </aside>\n<p>For 59 years, the United States has maintained a cruel embargo against Cuba. &ldquo;The embargo on Cuba is the most comprehensive set of U.S. sanctions on any country, including the other countries designated by the U.S. government to be state sponsors of terrorism &mdash; Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0880.pdf\">according to the U.S. government</a>.</p>\n<p>In 1960, the Eisenhower administration declared a partial embargo on trade with Cuba in an attempt to pressure Cuba to change its form of government. The embargo was prompted by a <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v06/d499\">secret State Department memorandum</a> that proposed &ldquo;a line of action which, while as adroit and inconspicuous as possible, makes the greatest inroads in denying money and supplies to Cuba, to decrease monetary and real wages, to bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This type of action is illegal under international law, according to Idriss Jazairy, the U.N. special rapporteur concerned with the negative impact of sanctions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Coercion, whether military or economic, must never be used to seek a change in government in a sovereign state,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24131&LangID=E\">said</a> Jazairy. &ldquo;The use of sanctions by outside powers to overthrow an elected government is in violation of all norms of international law.&rdquo; That includes the <a href=\"https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20119/volume-119-I-1609-English.pdf\">Charter of the Organization of American States</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.un-documents.net/a29r3281.htm\">Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States</a>.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, John F. Kennedy expanded the embargo in 1962 and every U.S. president since has continued it, hurting the Cuban people, but not succeeding in overthrowing Cuba&rsquo;s government.</p>\n<p>In 1996, Bill Clinton signed the <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/documents/libertad.pdf\">Helms-Burton Act</a>, which codified the embargo into law so that no president could unilaterally lift the sanctions against Cuba. Although Barack Obama <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/trump-takes-aim-at-obama-s-detente-with-cuba/\">took some limited steps</a> toward normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba, Helms-Burton would have prevented him from lifting the embargo.</p>\n<h2><strong>Will Trump Open the Floodgates of Litigation?</strong></h2>\n<p>After the Cuban Revolution, the new government led by Fidel Castro nationalized the property of Cuban nationals, many of whom then fled Cuba and emigrated to the United States. Helms-Burton contains a <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/documents/libertad.pdf\">notorious provision</a> in Title III that allows private lawsuits against U.S. and foreign entities for allegedly &ldquo;trafficking&rdquo; in property confiscated in Cuba since 1959. &ldquo;Trafficking&rdquo; as defined includes knowingly engaging in a commercial activity or otherwise &ldquo;benefitting from confiscated property.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Every U.S. president beginning with Clinton has delayed the implementation of Title III by waiving its provisions in six-month increments. Clinton put Title III &ldquo;on hold because it triggered immense opposition from U.S. allies, whose companies operating in Cuba would become targets of litigation in U.S. courts,&rdquo; American University professor and Cuba scholar William M. LeoGrande <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-may-seek-more-punishment-of-cuba-111947\">wrote in <em>The Conversation</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s waiver was also motivated by the European Union&rsquo;s filing of a <a href=\"https://energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/pictures/DecertificationJCPOARiskofEUBlockingRegulations1017%20.pdf\">complaint</a> against the United States in the World Trade Organization and adoption of a statute that forbids EU members and their firms from complying with Title III.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the Trump administration has followed suit with three six-month waivers. But on January 16, the president waived Title III for only 45 days, from February 1 to March 17, while his administration conducts &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cuba/us-considering-allowing-lawsuits-over-cuba-confiscated-properties-idUSKCN1PA30I\">a careful review</a>&rdquo; of whether to allow the provision to go into effect. He will announce his decision by March 2.</p>\n<p>If Trump does activate Title III, it would be the first time since Helms-Burton was enacted. It would tie up U.S. and foreign firms in a tidal wave of litigation if they do business with Cuba &mdash; including in medicine and agriculture &mdash; and have allegedly benefited from confiscated properties.</p>\n<p>Up to <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R44822\">200,000 people</a> who were not U.S. citizens at the time of their property&rsquo;s confiscation would be able to file claims for property they held in Cuba when they were Cuban citizens. This is considerably more than the nearly 6,000 claims already filed by U.S. parties at the time their property was nationalized.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cuba&rsquo;s Nationalization Did Not Violate Either U.S. or International Law</strong></h2>\n<p>The U.S. State Department takes the well-established position that a sovereign&rsquo;s nationalization of the property of its own nationals does not violate international law. In 1962, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1848&context=dlj\">told the National Business Advisory Council</a>:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>Any sovereign national has the right to expropriate property, whether owned by foreigners or nationals. In the United States we refer to this as the power of eminent domain. However, the owner should receive adequate and prompt compensation for his property.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>On several occasions, Cuba has offered to negotiate compensation of the nearly 6,000 claims of U.S. parties, as it has successfully done with claims from other countries. &ldquo;It is well-known that all nationalizations of foreign property, including that of the U.S., were provided by law with a commitment to compensation, which the U.S. government refused even to discuss, while it was adopted by the governments of claimants of other countries, all of which enjoyed due compensation,&rdquo; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Cuba <a href=\"https://en.granma.cu/cuba/2019-01-17/cuba-categorically-rejects-the-threat-of-activation-of-title-iii-of-the-helms-burton-act\">said in a statement</a>.</p>\n<p>Permitting lawsuits to proceed under Title III would overturn long-standing law. In 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/376/398/#tab-opinion-1944815\">held in <em>Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino</em></a> that U.S. courts should not decide the legality of taking property in Cuba&rsquo;s jurisdiction and that state-to-state negotiations provide the best way to resolve these issues.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Title III attempts to reverse that precedent, placing the long-term future of U.S.-Cuban relations into innumerable private hands and holding hostage the ability to normalize relations for decades,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.nlg.org/nlg-ic-condemns-trump-administration-threat-to-unleash-unprecedented-lawsuits-against-companies-doing-business-with-cuba/\">according to the National Lawyers Guild&rsquo;s International Committee</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Trump Says &ldquo;Make Rubio Happy&rdquo;</strong></h2>\n<p>On January 16, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1085729851900915713\">ominously tweeted</a>, &ldquo;Todays waiver of Title III of Helms-Burton for only 45 days instead of the customary 180 days &amp; the accompanying warning, is a strong indication of what comes next.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Does Rubio have inside information? Very likely. <em>The New York Times </em>recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/world/americas/marco-rubio-venezuela.html\">called Rubio</a> &ldquo;a virtual secretary of state for Latin America.&rdquo; Indeed, Trump <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/19/the-mystery-of-the-havana-syndrome\">described</a> his Cuba policy to White House staff early in his term: &ldquo;Make Rubio happy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Rubio and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Florida), whose brother <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sfl-diaz-balart-immigration-cuba-121910-story.html\">pressured Clinton</a> into signing Helms-Burton, are the leading advocates for Title III. They represent the richest and most conservative people in Miami&rsquo;s Cuban-American community, once known as Cuba&rsquo;s &ldquo;One Percent,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-may-seek-more-punishment-of-cuba-111947\">LeoGrande writes</a>. Since Title III exempts private residences and small businesses from potential compensation, it is the one-percenters &mdash; people who owned businesses worth more than $433,000 at today&rsquo;s prices &mdash; who have the most to gain if Trump unblocks Title III and allows litigation to proceed.</p>\n<p>Trump is also apparently making Rubio happy by recognizing Juan Guaid&oacute; as Venezuela&rsquo;s legitimate president, albeit <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/the-us-is-orchestrating-a-coup-in-venezuela/\">in violation of international law</a>. Rubio is part of Trump&rsquo;s inner circle working with the opposition in Venezuela to carry out an illegal coup.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Venezuela is really an extension of the position on Cuba,&rdquo; Ricardo Herrera, director of the Cuba Study Group, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/153115/marco-rubio-trumps-shadow-secretary-state\">told <em>The New Republic</em></a>. Both nations are targets in a plan to reassert U.S. control over Latin America, and finally overthrow the Cuban Revolution, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-push-to-oust-venezuelas-maduro-marks-first-shot-in-plan-to-reshape-latin-america-11548888252\">according to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>.</p>\n<p>At a February 18 rally in Miami, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/world/americas/trump-maduro-miami-speech.html\">played to a large voting bloc</a> by criticizing Venezuelan President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro. South Florida has the largest population of Venezuelans in the United States, many of whom are <a href=\"https://miami.cbslocal.com/2019/01/23/south-florida-venezuelans-to-join-world-wide-protests-against-maduro-at-doral-park/\">opposed to</a> Maduro&rsquo;s government. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-Florida) accused the Trump administration of &ldquo;using Venezuelans&rsquo; suffering to score political points here in Florida,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t be using this as a political weapon.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But, &ldquo;Trump doesn&rsquo;t care about Latin America. It&rsquo;s still about domestic politics,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/153115/marco-rubio-trumps-shadow-secretary-state\">LeoGrande told <em>The New Republic</em></a>. &ldquo;Trump thinks he won Florida because of the Cuban American vote. Rubio convinced him that that&rsquo;s what made the big difference in Florida.&rdquo; Many older Cuban Americans oppose the Cuban government and have been pivotal votes for Republican presidential candidates in the swing state of Florida.</p>\n<h2><strong>Who Stands to Lose If Title III Is Activated?</strong></h2>\n<p>It is the Cuban people who would suffer most from the activation of Title III. A torrent of lawsuits would not only discourage foreign firms from trading with, investing in, or operating in Cuba; they would also endanger the food supply and other essentials for life in Cuba for years to come. They would <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-may-seek-more-punishment-of-cuba-111947\">weaken Cuba&rsquo;s fragile economy</a>.</p>\n<p>Title III could affect firms that currently operate in Cuba on confiscated property and companies that profit from such &ldquo;trafficking.&rdquo; Because of jurisdictional issues, U.S.-based companies would be the most vulnerable to these lawsuits, which would disadvantage them internationally. They would be unlikely to expand their operations in Cuba.</p>\n<p>Ending the suspension of Title III would have a chilling effect on future efforts to normalize relations with Cuba because it was written to prevent future U.S. administrations from interfering with this private litigation. Sanctioning lawsuits under Title III could also negatively impact areas such as travel, academic exchanges and research collaboration.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cuba has asserted its own claims against the U.S. for billions of dollars of injury due to the impact of the illegal and expanded multinational economic embargo against Cuba, which had been intentionally enacted to deny money and supplies to Cuba, to impose hunger and hardship and seek to overthrow its government, as quoted above. One such case filed in Cuban civil courts in 2000 sought over $120 billion in damages. A prior case sought more than $180 billion in damages based on illegal acts of violence and sabotage, including CIA sponsorship of the Bay of Pigs invasion; this resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/law/help/sovereign-immunity/cuba.php\">judgment</a> in 1999. Cuba seeks resolution of its claims as part of its attempt to mutually resolve issues between Cuba and the United States.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Activating Title III would represent a quantum leap in hostility [against Cuba],&rdquo; <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-may-seek-more-punishment-of-cuba-111947\">LeoGrande maintains</a>. By refusing to further suspend Title III, Trump would effectively be punishing the Cuban people with a second embargo.</p>\n<p>Cuba represents no threat to the United States. It is time to end the illegal 59-year-old embargo against Cuba once and for all.</p>\n<aside><a href=\"https://truthout.org/donate\"> <p>As attacks on women&rsquo;s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we&rsquo;re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever. </p> <p>At Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship. <b>But this is only sustainable if we have your support.</b> If you like what you&rsquo;re reading or just value what we do, will you take a few seconds to contribute to our work? </p>  Donate Now </a></aside>",

                "text": "The Trump administration is threatening to unleash a flood of lawsuits involving Cuba, which no U.S. president has ever done. It has set a deadline of March 2 to announce whether it will create, in the words of the National Lawyers Guild, \u201ca second embargo\u201d of Cuba \u2014 \u201cone that would be very difficult to dismantle in the future.\u201d\nTrump may give current U.S. citizens standing to sue in U.S. courts even if they were Cuban citizens when the Cuban government nationalized their property after the 1959 Revolution. They would be able to bring lawsuits against U.S. and foreign companies that allegedly profit from the nationalized properties.\nIn accordance with international law, the Cuban government had offered compensation to U.S. nationals for the taking of their property, as I explain below. If Trump permits myriad new lawsuits to proceed, it would unleash a tsunami of litigation that would harm U.S. companies and punish the Cuban people even more.\nThe stories you care about, right at your fingertips\nGet Truthout\u2019s daily edition delivered to your inbox.\nFor 59 years, the United States has maintained a cruel embargo against Cuba. \u201cThe embargo on Cuba is the most comprehensive set of U.S. sanctions on any country, including the other countries designated by the U.S. government to be state sponsors of terrorism \u2014 Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria,\u201d according to the U.S. government.\nIn 1960, the Eisenhower administration declared a partial embargo on trade with Cuba in an attempt to pressure Cuba to change its form of government. The embargo was prompted by a secret State Department memorandum that proposed \u201ca line of action which, while as adroit and inconspicuous as possible, makes the greatest inroads in denying money and supplies to Cuba, to decrease monetary and real wages, to bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government.\u201d\nThis type of action is illegal under international law, according to Idriss Jazairy, the U.N. special rapporteur concerned with the negative impact of sanctions.\n\u201cCoercion, whether military or economic, must never be used to seek a change in government in a sovereign state,\u201d said Jazairy. \u201cThe use of sanctions by outside powers to overthrow an elected government is in violation of all norms of international law.\u201d That includes the Charter of the Organization of American States and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.\nNonetheless, John F. Kennedy expanded the embargo in 1962 and every U.S. president since has continued it, hurting the Cuban people, but not succeeding in overthrowing Cuba\u2019s government.\nIn 1996, Bill Clinton signed the Helms-Burton Act, which codified the embargo into law so that no president could unilaterally lift the sanctions against Cuba. Although Barack Obama took some limited steps toward normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba, Helms-Burton would have prevented him from lifting the embargo.\nWill Trump Open the Floodgates of Litigation?\nAfter the Cuban Revolution, the new government led by Fidel Castro nationalized the property of Cuban nationals, many of whom then fled Cuba and emigrated to the United States. Helms-Burton contains a notorious provision in Title III that allows private lawsuits against U.S. and foreign entities for allegedly \u201ctrafficking\u201d in property confiscated in Cuba since 1959. \u201cTrafficking\u201d as defined includes knowingly engaging in a commercial activity or otherwise \u201cbenefitting from confiscated property.\u201d\nEvery U.S. president beginning with Clinton has delayed the implementation of Title III by waiving its provisions in six-month increments. Clinton put Title III \u201con hold because it triggered immense opposition from U.S. allies, whose companies operating in Cuba would become targets of litigation in U.S. courts,\u201d American University professor and Cuba scholar William M. LeoGrande wrote in The Conversation.\nClinton\u2019s waiver was also motivated by the European Union\u2019s filing of a complaint against the United States in the World Trade Organization and adoption of a statute that forbids EU members and their firms from complying with Title III.\nThus far, the Trump administration has followed suit with three six-month waivers. But on January 16, the president waived Title III for only 45 days, from February 1 to March 17, while his administration conducts \u201ca careful review\u201d of whether to allow the provision to go into effect. He will announce his decision by March 2.\nIf Trump does activate Title III, it would be the first time since Helms-Burton was enacted. It would tie up U.S. and foreign firms in a tidal wave of litigation if they do business with Cuba \u2014 including in medicine and agriculture \u2014 and have allegedly benefited from confiscated properties.\nUp to 200,000 people who were not U.S. citizens at the time of their property\u2019s confiscation would be able to file claims for property they held in Cuba when they were Cuban citizens. This is considerably more than the nearly 6,000 claims already filed by U.S. parties at the time their property was nationalized.\nCuba\u2019s Nationalization Did Not Violate Either U.S. or International Law\nThe U.S. State Department takes the well-established position that a sovereign\u2019s nationalization of the property of its own nationals does not violate international law. In 1962, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk told the National Business Advisory Council:\nAny sovereign national has the right to expropriate property, whether owned by foreigners or nationals. In the United States we refer to this as the power of eminent domain. However, the owner should receive adequate and prompt compensation for his property.\nOn several occasions, Cuba has offered to negotiate compensation of the nearly 6,000 claims of U.S. parties, as it has successfully done with claims from other countries. \u201cIt is well-known that all nationalizations of foreign property, including that of the U.S., were provided by law with a commitment to compensation, which the U.S. government refused even to discuss, while it was adopted by the governments of claimants of other countries, all of which enjoyed due compensation,\u201d the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Cuba said in a statement.\nPermitting lawsuits to proceed under Title III would overturn long-standing law. In 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino that U.S. courts should not decide the legality of taking property in Cuba\u2019s jurisdiction and that state-to-state negotiations provide the best way to resolve these issues.\n\u201cTitle III attempts to reverse that precedent, placing the long-term future of U.S.-Cuban relations into innumerable private hands and holding hostage the ability to normalize relations for decades,\u201d according to the National Lawyers Guild\u2019s International Committee.\nTrump Says \u201cMake Rubio Happy\u201d\nOn January 16, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) ominously tweeted, \u201cTodays waiver of Title III of Helms-Burton for only 45 days instead of the customary 180 days & the accompanying warning, is a strong indication of what comes next.\u201d\nDoes Rubio have inside information? Very likely. The New York Times recently called Rubio \u201ca virtual secretary of state for Latin America.\u201d Indeed, Trump described his Cuba policy to White House staff early in his term: \u201cMake Rubio happy.\u201d\nRubio and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Florida), whose brother pressured Clinton into signing Helms-Burton, are the leading advocates for Title III. They represent the richest and most conservative people in Miami\u2019s Cuban-American community, once known as Cuba\u2019s \u201cOne Percent,\u201d LeoGrande writes. Since Title III exempts private residences and small businesses from potential compensation, it is the one-percenters \u2014 people who owned businesses worth more than $433,000 at today\u2019s prices \u2014 who have the most to gain if Trump unblocks Title III and allows litigation to proceed.\nTrump is also apparently making Rubio happy by recognizing Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president, albeit in violation of international law. Rubio is part of Trump\u2019s inner circle working with the opposition in Venezuela to carry out an illegal coup.\n\u201cVenezuela is really an extension of the position on Cuba,\u201d Ricardo Herrera, director of the Cuba Study Group, told The New Republic. Both nations are targets in a plan to reassert U.S. control over Latin America, and finally overthrow the Cuban Revolution, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nAt a February 18 rally in Miami, Trump played to a large voting bloc by criticizing Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. South Florida has the largest population of Venezuelans in the United States, many of whom are opposed to Maduro\u2019s government. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-Florida) accused the Trump administration of \u201cusing Venezuelans\u2019 suffering to score political points here in Florida,\u201d adding, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be using this as a political weapon.\u201d\nBut, \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t care about Latin America. It\u2019s still about domestic politics,\u201d LeoGrande told The New Republic. \u201cTrump thinks he won Florida because of the Cuban American vote. Rubio convinced him that that\u2019s what made the big difference in Florida.\u201d Many older Cuban Americans oppose the Cuban government and have been pivotal votes for Republican presidential candidates in the swing state of Florida.\nWho Stands to Lose If Title III Is Activated?\nIt is the Cuban people who would suffer most from the activation of Title III. A torrent of lawsuits would not only discourage foreign firms from trading with, investing in, or operating in Cuba; they would also endanger the food supply and other essentials for life in Cuba for years to come. They would weaken Cuba\u2019s fragile economy.\nTitle III could affect firms that currently operate in Cuba on confiscated property and companies that profit from such \u201ctrafficking.\u201d Because of jurisdictional issues, U.S.-based companies would be the most vulnerable to these lawsuits, which would disadvantage them internationally. They would be unlikely to expand their operations in Cuba.\nEnding the suspension of Title III would have a chilling effect on future efforts to normalize relations with Cuba because it was written to prevent future U.S. administrations from interfering with this private litigation. Sanctioning lawsuits under Title III could also negatively impact areas such as travel, academic exchanges and research collaboration.\nMeanwhile, Cuba has asserted its own claims against the U.S. for billions of dollars of injury due to the impact of the illegal and expanded multinational economic embargo against Cuba, which had been intentionally enacted to deny money and supplies to Cuba, to impose hunger and hardship and seek to overthrow its government, as quoted above. One such case filed in Cuban civil courts in 2000 sought over $120 billion in damages. A prior case sought more than $180 billion in damages based on illegal acts of violence and sabotage, including CIA sponsorship of the Bay of Pigs invasion; this resulted in a judgment in 1999. Cuba seeks resolution of its claims as part of its attempt to mutually resolve issues between Cuba and the United States.\n\u201cActivating Title III would represent a quantum leap in hostility [against Cuba],\u201d LeoGrande maintains. By refusing to further suspend Title III, Trump would effectively be punishing the Cuban people with a second embargo.\nCuba represents no threat to the United States. It is time to end the illegal 59-year-old embargo against Cuba once and for all.\nAs attacks on women\u2019s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we\u2019re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever.\nAt Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship.

                "html": "<p>Americans have one day left to tell the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to preserve life-saving pollution standards.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Trump administration proposed a plan to move forward with dismantling safeguards on dangerous mercury and toxic pollution from power plants. Doing so would boost levels of mercury, soot and other hazardous pollution into our nation&rsquo;s air, water, food and communities. These standards &mdash; the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/mats\">Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)</a> &mdash; were developed in consultation with medical and public health experts in order to keep Americans healthy and safe.</p>\n<p>As a doctor in Pennsylvania, I have seen just how important these standards are. Children are especially vulnerable to mercury&rsquo;s harmful effects on the brain before birth and during early childhood. Coal-related mercury pollution has so contaminated Pennsylvania&rsquo;s landscape that the state&rsquo;s Fish and Boat Commission has <a href=\"https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/CleanWater/WaterQuality/FishConsumptionAdvisory/Pages/default.aspx\">advised</a> pregnant women to limit local fish consumption to one meal per week.</p>\n<aside><h2>The stories you care about, right at your fingertips</h2> <p>Get Truthout&rsquo;s daily edition delivered to your inbox.</p>  </aside>\n<p>The technology that reduces mercury and hazardous air pollution also cuts pollution from other microscopic soot particles (particulate matter) and lung-tissue-burning ozone. Known as a &ldquo;co-benefit&rdquo; to the MATS, this is where these standards save the most lives. Our <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404667/\">medical literature</a> is replete with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3521092/\">studies</a> showing that cutting these pollutants prevents death, disability, and hospital visits that result from lung disease, asthma, heart attack, stroke and even diabetes.</p>\n<p>These standards are working as intended, keeping families healthy and safe. Before these standards were put in place, mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants was completely unlimited, and accounted for <a href=\"https://www.momscleanairforce.org/mercury-standards-benefits/\">48 percent of all human-caused mercury pollution</a>, according to a report by Columbia University.</p>\n<p>Overall, the EPA&rsquo;s own scientists calculated that nationwide, the MATS is preventing up to 11,000 premature deaths, nearly 5,000 heart attacks, 130,000 asthma attacks and 5,700 hospital and emergency room visits each year. Between 2011 and 2017, mercury pollution declined by more than <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/reports/2018/12/18/464269/trumps-epa-poised-undo-progress-mercury-pollution-reduction/\">81 percent</a> nationwide thanks to the very standards that the Trump administration is now threatening. For Pennsylvania, the amount of mercury pollution has decreased by a remarkable <a href=\"https://www.momscleanairforce.org/mercury-pollution-pennsylvania/\">90 percent</a>, amounting to $4.4 billion in health benefits to Pennsylvanians each year.</p>\n<p>Even the power industry wants to keep our mercury standards in place. These companies have already invested <a href=\"https://www.momscleanairforce.org/power-companies-want-mercury-standards/\">$18 billion in meeting the standards</a> nationwide, and rolling back mercury pollution protections would jeopardize their ability to profit from that investment in the long term.</p>\n<p>What can we do to prevent this dangerous rollback and make our voices heard? As a family physician and educator, my prescription is take five minutes to submit a <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=EPA-HQ-OAR-2018-0794-0001\">public comment to the EPA</a> on this misguided rule change by April 17.</p>\n<p>The reality is that dismantling mercury protections jeopardizes public health. I oppose these rollbacks in the strongest possible terms and urge the Trump administration to reconsider this misguided proposal for the sake of our children and our future.</p>\n<aside><a href=\"https://truthout.org/donate\"> <p>As attacks on women&rsquo;s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we&rsquo;re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever. </p> <p>At Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship. <b>But this is only sustainable if we have your support.</b> If you like what you&rsquo;re reading or just value what we do, will you take a few seconds to contribute to our work? </p>  Donate Now </a></aside>",

                "text": "Americans have one day left to tell the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to preserve life-saving pollution standards.\nLast year, the Trump administration proposed a plan to move forward with dismantling safeguards on dangerous mercury and toxic pollution from power plants. Doing so would boost levels of mercury, soot and other hazardous pollution into our nation\u2019s air, water, food and communities. These standards \u2014 the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) \u2014 were developed in consultation with medical and public health experts in order to keep Americans healthy and safe.\nAs a doctor in Pennsylvania, I have seen just how important these standards are. Children are especially vulnerable to mercury\u2019s harmful effects on the brain before birth and during early childhood. Coal-related mercury pollution has so contaminated Pennsylvania\u2019s landscape that the state\u2019s Fish and Boat Commission has advised pregnant women to limit local fish consumption to one meal per week.\nThe stories you care about, right at your fingertips\nGet Truthout\u2019s daily edition delivered to your inbox.\nThe technology that reduces mercury and hazardous air pollution also cuts pollution from other microscopic soot particles (particulate matter) and lung-tissue-burning ozone. Known as a \u201cco-benefit\u201d to the MATS, this is where these standards save the most lives. Our medical literature is replete with studies showing that cutting these pollutants prevents death, disability, and hospital visits that result from lung disease, asthma, heart attack, stroke and even diabetes.\nThese standards are working as intended, keeping families healthy and safe. Before these standards were put in place, mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants was completely unlimited, and accounted for 48 percent of all human-caused mercury pollution, according to a report by Columbia University.\nOverall, the EPA\u2019s own scientists calculated that nationwide, the MATS is preventing up to 11,000 premature deaths, nearly 5,000 heart attacks, 130,000 asthma attacks and 5,700 hospital and emergency room visits each year. Between 2011 and 2017, mercury pollution declined by more than 81 percent nationwide thanks to the very standards that the Trump administration is now threatening. For Pennsylvania, the amount of mercury pollution has decreased by a remarkable 90 percent, amounting to $4.4 billion in health benefits to Pennsylvanians each year.\nEven the power industry wants to keep our mercury standards in place. These companies have already invested $18 billion in meeting the standards nationwide, and rolling back mercury pollution protections would jeopardize their ability to profit from that investment in the long term.\nWhat can we do to prevent this dangerous rollback and make our voices heard? As a family physician and educator, my prescription is take five minutes to submit a public comment to the EPA on this misguided rule change by April 17.\nThe reality is that dismantling mercury protections jeopardizes public health. I oppose these rollbacks in the strongest possible terms and urge the Trump administration to reconsider this misguided proposal for the sake of our children and our future.\nAs attacks on women\u2019s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we\u2019re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever.\nAt Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship. But this is only sustainable if we have your support. If you like what you\u2019re reading or just value what we do, will you take a few seconds to contribute to our work?\nDonate Now",

That&rsquo;s how many U.S. middle-class workers will be left without strong overtime pay protections under the Trump administration&rsquo;s weak overtime rule proposed on March 22.</p>\n<p>In human terms, that means 8 million working people across the 50 states can be made to work up to 50, 60 or even 70 hours a week, missing time with their families, without receiving any extra pay, even if they make as little as $35,000 a year.</p>\n<p>The problem is the salary threshold below which workers are guaranteed time-and-a-half overtime pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week has been frozen for decades, with no adjustment for the rising cost of living. As a result, the share of salaried workers guaranteed overtime pay has plummeted from <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/whats-at-stake-in-the-states-if-the-2016-federal-raise-to-the-overtime-pay-threshold-is-not-preserved/\">six in 10 in 1975 to less than one in 10 today</a>.</p>\n<aside> <p>Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.</p>  </aside>\n<p>The Trump administration claimed that the new overtime salary threshold is a win for workers, and many news outlets echoed the administration&rsquo;s spin, declaring in headlines across the country that the Trump rule is an &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-overtime/trump-administration-proposes-overtime-pay-expansion-idUSKCN1QO2UW\">expansion</a><u>,</u>&rdquo; or at least a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/more-workers-deserve-overtime-pay-a-compromise-bill-in-congress-would-be-a-good-start/2019/03/21/eca27e92-4a75-11e9-93d0-64dbcf38ba41_story.html?utm_term=.137e8ca59cea\">compromise</a>&rdquo; on overtime pay. In reality, it is a significant rollback that will cheat millions of Americans of fair pay for hard work.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s because the Trump overtime regulation replaces a 2016 Obama-era Labor Department rule that would have restored overtime protections for more than 12 million salaried workers earning up to <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/trump-overtime-proposal-april-update/\">$55,055 by 2023</a>. The Trump rule slashes that salary level to $35,308 &mdash; and treats workers earning more than that as if they were highly paid executive who don&rsquo;t need overtime pay. All told, Trump&rsquo;s decision to slash the salary threshold means workers will miss out <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/trump-overtime-proposal-april-update/\">on $1.2 billion in wages each year</a> they would have received under the 2016 rule.</p>\n<p>The overtime salary threshold is supposed to protect workers with little bargaining power &mdash; think of modestly paid front-line supervisors at fast food restaurants or discount stores &mdash; from being forced to work long hours for no pay.</p>\n<aside>Trump&rsquo;s decision to slash the salary threshold means workers will miss out on $1.2 billion in wages each year.</aside>\n<p>Typical of them is Charney, who works as a salaried manager at a dollar store in Michigan. Most weeks she clocks 65 hours, missing dinner with her family and time with her kids, with no overtime pay for her long hours and dedication.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I did the math, and I make 50 cents more than my assistant, who is eligible for overtime and gets holiday pay,&rdquo; she told <em>Truthout</em>. &ldquo;I work on average 30 hours a week more than my assistants. I feel completely taken advantage of.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Obama-era rule was a modest first step toward correcting a system that was increasingly leaving workers behind. It would have restored overtime coverage to about one in three salaried workers.</p>\n<p>But despite an extensive rule-making process that lasted two years and included a quarter-million public comments driven by worker advocates, the Trump Labor Department abandoned it. U.S. workers have lost more than $1.6 billion in unpaid overtime as a result.</p>\n<aside>Polling in competitive congressional districts shows that voters overwhelmingly support the stronger Obama-era overtime expansion.</aside>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the weak Trump overtime proposal is deeply unpopular with voters. New<a href=\"https://www.nelp.org/wp-content/uploads/Memo-NELP-Overtime-Opinion-Poll-Results.pdf\"> polling conducted by Hart Research</a> in competitive congressional districts shows that voters in swing districts overwhelmingly support the stronger Obama-era overtime expansion (by a 76 to 16 margin) over the weak Trump substitute. Independents back the Obama proposal over the Trump substitute by a whopping 71 to 15 margin. Republicans prefer it 65-to-27, and Democrats 89-to-7.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, states can and are stepping in to protect workers from the Trump overtime rollback. In many states, governors can raise the overtime salary threshold through action by their state labor departments without the need for legislation. Moreover, in every state, the legislature can act to protect overtime pay.</p>\n<p>Labor departments in California and New York have already raised their states&rsquo; overtime salary thresholds significantly; Washington and Pennsylvania&rsquo;s labor agencies are in the process of doing the same. Other proposals are pending in Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Maryland and Colorado.</p>\n<p>In particular, state-level action can and should go beyond the Obama overtime standard, which was a minimal national benchmark based on salary levels in the Southern U.S., the nation&rsquo;s lowest-wage region. Higher-wage states can increase their overtime salary thresholds to commensurate levels, as Washington and Massachusetts are currently proposing.</p>\n<p>At his inauguration, President Trump pledged that &ldquo;Every decision &hellip; will be made to benefit American workers.&rdquo; But the administration&rsquo;s rollback of overtime pay protections and its record of <a href=\"https://nelp.box.com/s/4py7yv2r4do086gmfxo7sdxztjygsd1a\">dismantling worker protections at every turn</a> show whose side the administration is really on when it comes to middle-class families struggling for a decent paycheck.</p>\n<p>In the 2018 midterms, overtime pay already emerged<a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/punching-in-new-trump-regulatory-plan-on-the-way\"> as a key issue in several races</a>. The overwhelming voter opposition to the latest Trump rollback means it&rsquo;s likely to be back in 2020 as voters consider which candidates have their interests at heart.</p>\n<aside><a href=\"https://truthout.org/donate\"><h4>The stakes have never been higher</h4> <p>As attacks on women&rsquo;s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we&rsquo;re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever. </p> <p>At Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship. <b>But this is only sustainable if we have your support.</b> If you like what you&rsquo;re reading or just value what we do, will you take a few seconds to contribute to our work? </p>  Donate Now </a></aside>",

                "text": "Eight million. That\u2019s how many U.S. middle-class workers will be left without strong overtime pay protections under the Trump administration\u2019s weak overtime rule proposed on March 22.\nIn human terms, that means 8 million working people across the 50 states can be made to work up to 50, 60 or even 70 hours a week, missing time with their families, without receiving any extra pay, even if they make as little as $35,000 a year.\nThe problem is the salary threshold below which workers are guaranteed time-and-a-half overtime pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week has been frozen for decades, with no adjustment for the rising cost of living. As a result, the share of salaried workers guaranteed overtime pay has plummeted from six in 10 in 1975 to less than one in 10 today.\nGet the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.\nThe Trump administration claimed that the new overtime salary threshold is a win for workers, and many news outlets echoed the administration\u2019s spin, declaring in headlines across the country that the Trump rule is an \u201cexpansion,\u201d or at least a \u201ccompromise\u201d on overtime pay. In reality, it is a significant rollback that will cheat millions of Americans of fair pay for hard work.\nThat\u2019s because the Trump overtime regulation replaces a 2016 Obama-era Labor Department rule that would have restored overtime protections for more than 12 million salaried workers earning up to $55,055 by 2023. The Trump rule slashes that salary level to $35,308 \u2014 and treats workers earning more than that as if they were highly paid executive who don\u2019t need overtime pay. All told, Trump\u2019s decision to slash the salary threshold means workers will miss out on $1.2 billion in wages each year they would have received under the 2016 rule.\nThe overtime salary threshold is supposed to protect workers with little bargaining power \u2014 think of modestly paid front-line supervisors at fast food restaurants or discount stores \u2014 from being forced to work long hours for no pay.\nTrump\u2019s decision to slash the salary threshold means workers will miss out on $1.2 billion in wages each year.\nTypical of them is Charney, who works as a salaried manager at a dollar store in Michigan. Most weeks she clocks 65 hours, missing dinner with her family and time with her kids, with no overtime pay for her long hours and dedication.\n\u201cI did the math, and I make 50 cents more than my assistant, who is eligible for overtime and gets holiday pay,\u201d she told Truthout. \u201cI work on average 30 hours a week more than my assistants. I feel completely taken advantage of.\u201d\nThe Obama-era rule was a modest first step toward correcting a system that was increasingly leaving workers behind. It would have restored overtime coverage to about one in three salaried workers.\nBut despite an extensive rule-making process that lasted two years and included a quarter-million public comments driven by worker advocates, the Trump Labor Department abandoned it. U.S. workers have lost more than $1.6 billion in unpaid overtime as a result.\nPolling in competitive congressional districts shows that voters overwhelmingly support the stronger Obama-era overtime expansion.\nUnsurprisingly, the weak Trump overtime proposal is deeply unpopular with voters. New polling conducted by Hart Research in competitive congressional districts shows that voters in swing districts overwhelmingly support the stronger Obama-era overtime expansion (by a 76 to 16 margin) over the weak Trump substitute. Independents back the Obama proposal over the Trump substitute by a whopping 71 to 15 margin. Republicans prefer it 65-to-27, and Democrats 89-to-7.\nFortunately, states can and are stepping in to protect workers from the Trump overtime rollback. In many states, governors can raise the overtime salary threshold through action by their state labor departments without the need for legislation. Moreover, in every state, the legislature can act to protect overtime pay.\nLabor departments in California and New York have already raised their states\u2019 overtime salary thresholds significantly; Washington and Pennsylvania\u2019s labor agencies are in the process of doing the same. Other proposals are pending in Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Maryland and Colorado.\nIn particular, state-level action can and should go beyond the Obama overtime standard, which was a minimal national benchmark based on salary levels in the Southern U.S., the nation\u2019s lowest-wage region. Higher-wage states can increase their overtime salary thresholds to commensurate levels, as Washington and Massachusetts are currently proposing.\nAt his inauguration, President Trump pledged that \u201cEvery decision \u2026 will be made to benefit American workers.\u201d But the administration\u2019s rollback of overtime pay protections and its record of dismantling worker protections at every turn show whose side the administration is really on when it comes to middle-class families struggling for a decent paycheck.\nIn the 2018 midterms, overtime pay already emerged as a key issue in several races. The overwhelming voter opposition to the latest Trump rollback means it\u2019s likely to be back in 2020 as voters consider which candidates have their interests at heart.\nThe stakes have never been higher\nAs attacks on women\u2019s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we\u2019re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever.\nAt Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship.

                "html": "<p>For the first time in decades, it is possible that there will be no U.S. neo-Nazi party large enough to hold public rallies. In a story worthy of a plot-twisting HBO special, Black civil rights activist James Stern convinced the leader of the largest U.S. neo-Nazi party, the National Socialist Movement (NSM), to officially make him their president in order to help protect the party from a lawsuit. Afterward, he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2019/03/01/how-black-man-outsmarted-neo-nazi-group-became-their-new-leader/\">said</a>, &ldquo;As a Black man, I took over a neo-Nazi group and outsmarted them,&rdquo; and that he intends to dismantle the group from within.</p>\n<p>The NSM is important for opponents of the far right to watch because it is the largest open neo-Nazi group in the United States. As such, it is the furthest stop for a public, organized group on the right wing of the political spectrum. And after the 2018 collapse of the Traditionalist Worker Party, another large fascist party, the NSM has been the only neo-Nazi group able to hold public demonstrations of even a moderate size.</p>\n<p>This, in combination with several other recent events, marks the third major blow dealt to the white nationalist movement since 2016. The first was the wave of deplatforming after Charlottesville. (&ldquo;Deplatforming&rdquo; refers to the practice of cancelling digital and other services for certain political groups; for example, when PayPal cancels the accounts of racist groups.) The second was the <a href=\"https://www.colorlines.com/articles/alt-right-its-last-leg\">March 2018 meltdown</a>, when the Traditionalist Worker Party collapsed after a leadership sex scandal, and &ldquo;alt-right&rdquo; leader Richard Spencer&rsquo;s college tour ended after a <a href=\"https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2018/03/05/richard-spencer-michigan-state/397727002/\">disastrous finale</a> in Michigan.</p>\n<aside><h2>Uncompromised, uncompromising news</h2> <p>Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.</p>  </aside>\n<p>After spring 2018, the energy shifted from the white nationalist wing of the &ldquo;alt-right&rdquo; to the more moderate &ldquo;alt-lite&rdquo; &mdash; which shares the white nationalists&rsquo; conspiracy-fueled, Islamophobic vision, but doesn&rsquo;t call for a white ethnostate and allows in gay men, Jews, and people of color. But the alt-lite&rsquo;s reign was brief, especially for the Proud Boys, the largest and most violent of the alt-lite groups. In October 2018, 10 of its affiliates were arrested after a gang-style attack in New York City. Police had initially refused to make arrests but did so after the mayor and governor called for them to intervene. This spurred a <a href=\"https://feature.politicalresearch.org/alt-right-and-far-right-in-2018\">leadership shakeup</a> &mdash; founder Gavin McInnes resigned, and his first replacement lasted less than a week &mdash; and a change in public perceptions of the group. Media outlets, which previously referred to them as &ldquo;edgy right-wing provocateurs,&rdquo; now describe them as &ldquo;violent extremists with ties to white nationalism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The street fights that broke out across the country in 2017 and early 2018 between the far right and their antifascist opposition have waned. They now appear limited to the Pacific Northwest, where Joey Gibson&rsquo;s Patriot Prayer group had been working closely with the local Proud Boys. But this alliance, too, is now reeling from a one-two punch.</p>\n<p>The first punch was an internal schism: Tusitala &ldquo;Tiny&rdquo; Toese <a href=\"https://rosecityantifa.org/articles/haley-adams/\">left Patriot Prayer</a> for the Proud Boys. Toese had been Gibson&rsquo;s stalwart comrade, a main Patriot Prayer street-brawler, and a primary driver of the conflicts that usually occur in Portland, Oregon. The second punch was a series of indications that the cozy treatment that the area&rsquo;s far right has received from law enforcement may soon come to an end.</p>\n<p>Despite numerous arrests, Toese has <a href=\"https://www.wweek.com/news/courts/2019/02/20/portland-police-built-a-convincing-case-against-tusitala-tiny-toese-for-a-june-2018-assault-but-prosecutors-didnt-take-it-to-court/\">remained on the street</a>. Recently, communications were made public which showed that the Portland police had frequent and friendly contact with Patriot Prayer, and told them how to avoid arrest. At the same time, police used extreme measures against anti-fascists; at one demonstration they nearly <a href=\"https://www.wweek.com/news/courts/2018/09/19/protester-who-suffered-a-traumatic-brain-injury-from-a-flash-bang-grenade-intends-to-sue-the-portland-police/\">killed one</a>. According to <em>The Guardian</em>&lsquo;s Jason Wilson, Portland&rsquo;s mayor and some city councilors have promised an independent investigation into the police-Patriot Prayer relationship. New warrants have been issued against Toese and another Proud Boy, Donovon Flippo. Flippo has been arrested, while Toese is currently not in custody; on social media Toese has said he has gone to Samoa. All of this may finally signal a change in how Portland law enforcement treats the far right.</p>\n<p>In other locations, the courts are not hesitating to impose stiff sentences on violent far-right activists. Tyler Tenbrink, who had shot at anti-racist protestors after a Richard Spencer talk in Gainesville, Florida, in 2017, received a <a href=\"https://www.gainesville.com/news/20190227/richard-spencer-supporter-tenbrink-gets-15-year-term\">15-year sentence</a> in February 2019.</p>\n<p>White supremacists in the government&rsquo;s ranks are also receiving attention. Christopher Hasson, a white nationalist and Coast Guard member, was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/us/coast-guard-christopher-hasson-terrorist-attack.html\">arrested in February with a weapons cache</a>; he had allegedly written that he was &ldquo;dreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth.&rdquo; And a Marine, Mason Edward Mead, is <a href=\"https://www.stripes.com/news/ncis-investigates-allegations-that-pacific-based-marine-sent-pro-nazi-racist-tweets-1.570424\">under investigation</a> after he used social media to identify as a neo-Nazi and post a picture of TNT bricks laid out in the shape of a swastika.</p>\n<p>Finally, one of the last major &ldquo;alt-right&rdquo; fascist groups, Identity Evropa, is reeling from <a href=\"https://unicornriot.ninja/2019/neo-nazi-hipsters-identity-evropa-exposed-in-discord-chat-leak/\">over 770,000 internal messages</a> being made public on March 6 by the radical media project Unicorn Riot. Many Identity Evropa members have already been doxed based on this information. The group immediately announced a name change, and is now the <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/8xybkv/leaked-chats-show-white-nationalist-groups-plot-to-infiltrate-turning-point-usa\">American Identity Movement</a>. Identity Evropa had previously been successful as the largest &ldquo;alt-right&rdquo; fascist group. It cultivated a mainstream look and appealed to college-educated, middle-class whites, and pursued a strategy of entryism into the Republican Party. They had also bragged it was a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; group for professionals, since relatively few members had previously been doxed.</p>\n<p>The relationships &mdash; both between white nationalists and the alt-lite, as well as the far right in general and law enforcement &mdash; are significant because the far right cannot function without the aid of more mainstream conservatives. Robert Paxton&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://libcom.org/library/anatomy-fascism\"><em>The Anatomy of Fascism</em></a> shows how even Mussolini and Hitler relied on alliances with non-fascist conservatives to gain and keep power. In the United States, fascists have never been able to create a mass party. Where they have achieved limited success, they have needed sympathizers, collaborators and apologists from the more moderate factions of the right. The far right loves to use violence &mdash; but it can only do this if law enforcement permits.</p>\n<p>In late 2016, there was a working alliance among the Trumpist Republicans, the alt-lite and Patriot movement, and the white nationalists and fascists. All of these separate parts of the far right flourished as they egged on and aided each other, united by their support of Trump. After Charlottesville, mainstream conservatives finally considered the explicit white nationalists off limits to openly align with, although the alt-lite was still widely seen as acceptable among Trumpist Republicans. After fall 2018, many of the alt-lite have been treated as increasingly toxic as well.</p>\n<p>This said, it is worth looking specifically at what the explicitly neo-Nazi current is doing. Nazis, as well as other fascist currents, are the object of great fascination &mdash; both as the ultimate bad guy, and the most extreme end of conservative politics. But the actual political role of neo-Nazis in U.S. right-wing politics is complex.</p>\n<p>It is a small movement; I could not find published figures, but, after looking at estimates from previous decades and talking to others who closely watch the far right, I think there are several thousand people who identify as Nazis in the U.S. today. On one hand, Nazism acts as the logical endpoint for those who advocate conservative social hierarchies. Many Republicans deny being racist, while deploying code words against oppressed groups and advocating policies that may sometimes look neutral but in fact disproportionately harm oppressed people. For these bigots, Nazism is a logical conclusion of their politics.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Nazis&rsquo; European-derived politics have always been out-of-step with the vast majority of U.S. conservatives. The fascist advocacy of a strong state clashes with U.S. conservative rhetoric against &ldquo;big government.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Nazis do not just want &ldquo;more&rdquo; racism and anti-Semitism, nor even just to replace the U.S. government with a radically different system; they want to transform modern society as we know it. This gives them an appeal to constituencies that regular conservatives don&rsquo;t usually reach, such as some skinheads, black metal fans and biker gangs. Some members of these groups are drawn to neo-Nazism specifically because of its reputation as the most extreme political position possible &mdash; one often depicted as evil incarnate.</p>\n<p>This is true especially for Satanists like the <a href=\"https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/2019/02/16/state-of-hate-2019-order-of-nine-angles/\">Order of Nine Angles</a>, who encourage members to join extremist political groups. They have become influential on the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/satanism-drama-is-tearing-apart-the-murderous-neo-nazi-group-atomwaffen\">Atomwaffen Division</a>, a U.S. neo-Nazi group whose affiliates killed five people in 2017 and 2018.</p>\n<p>Many neo-Nazis use the reaction they provoke as an organizing tool. This included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/27/george-lincoln-rockwell-american-nazi-party-alt-right-charlottesville\">George Lincoln Rockwell</a>, the founder of the original American Nazi Party. In many ways, his politics were closer to ultra-conservatives like 1950s anti-Communist <a href=\"https://www.nypress.com/george-lincoln-rockwell-american-fuehrer/\">Senator Joseph McCarthy</a> than to Adolf Hitler. But, fueled by anti-Semitism, Rockwell craftily manipulated the Nazi label for publicity. (To this day, neo-Nazism&rsquo;s bedrock of anti-Semitism has sometimes distinguished it from other kinds of white nationalism; for example, neo-Nazis have claimed that Jews are behind the removal of Confederate statues.) Rockwell wrote in 1967 that:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>The Swastika and Hitler, far from being millstones, are actually the answer to the eternal problem of the right wing &mdash; money! &hellip; you can go into the streets and march and distribute homemade handbills and picket &mdash; for nothing. The Jews go wild, attack &mdash; and you then have free use of millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of Jewish TV, newspapers, magazines, etc.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>In the 1920s and &rsquo;30s there was open pro-Nazi organizing in the United States, although this was suppressed during the war. Afterward, new groups inspired by the Nazis formed &mdash; but they eschewed the label. Rockwell condemned them as &ldquo;Sneaky Nazis&rdquo; who hid their true beliefs. He garnered a huge amount of media attention by holding protests which took the opposite approach. But his group had less than a hundred members at its height, and he was assassinated in 1967 by a former member.</p>\n<p>After his murder, his party (which by then had changed its name to the National Socialist White People&rsquo;s Party, NSWPP) soon splintered. Some started promoting armed revolutionary warfare. Others took the &ldquo;Sneaky Nazi&rdquo; route, trying to soft-sell their ideas to gain more mainstream acceptance. The party still exists today under yet another name, the New Order, although it has abandoned high-profile demonstrations for private events.</p>\n<p>Some Nazis sought to continue Rockwell&rsquo;s legacy of having a membership-based organization that held public rallies. For years, the NSM was the largest neo-Nazi group deploying this strategy. It was originally founded in the mid-1970s by several neo-Nazis who were former and current members of the American Nazi Party/NSWPP. It continued as a very small group until 1994, when they recruited Jeff Schoep, a young skinhead who took over and turned it into the party it is today &mdash; that is, at least until he was taken in by a Black man who outsmarted him.</p>\n<p>For the last few years, the NSM has been searching for a new identity. Its rallies drew attention, but it was in a decaying orbit. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, in 2009 there were <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/national-socialist-movement\">61 NSM chapters</a>; in 2018 it was <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/neo-nazi\">down to six</a>. The &ldquo;alt-right&rdquo; clearly eclipsed them. New websites like <em>Daily Stormer</em>, and loosely organized groups like Atomwaffen Division, had caught the mood of youthful neo-Nazis.</p>\n<p>The remainder of the NSM is already fragmenting. A legal filing appointed Stern the group&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2019/03/06/national-socialist-movement-falls-disarray-league-south-neo-nazi-billy-roper-seek-pick\">president/director</a>,&rdquo; although this was initially kept a secret from the members. On a Russian social media site, <a href=\"https://hatetrackers.blogspot.com/2019/03/as-ratzis-abandon-sinking-ship-nsm.html\">Schoep announced he has stepped down</a> as the &ldquo;commander,&rdquo; and been replaced by Burt Colucci. Stern says he&rsquo;s going to keep the legal rights to the group&rsquo;s name, and use their website for Holocaust education. Even if the neo-Nazis can <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/fight-national-socialist-movement-james-hart-stern\">win a lawsuit</a> against Stern and regain control, Colucci will inherit a compromised and much smaller organization.</p>\n<p>So, with the Traditionalist Worker Party gone and the NSM in chaos, organized U.S. neo-Nazism is in disarray. The Atomwaffen Division has over two dozen affiliates but is undoubtedly under intense law enforcement surveillance and eschews public rallies. Vanguard America was a major &ldquo;alt-right,&rdquo; neo-Nazi group until Charlottesville. Afterward, it was superseded by the Patriot Front, who disguise their true politics with traditional patriotic language &mdash; classic &ldquo;Sneaky Nazis.&rdquo; The <em>Daily Stormer</em> has been driven to the dark web and its affiliated groups, which use the name &ldquo;Book Clubs&rdquo; (which they are not), are not lively organizations.</p>\n<p>Other neo-Nazis are in small groups like the New Order, as well as in splinter groups of current and former neo-Nazi groups. Some are members of broader white nationalist groups like American Identity Movement and the American Freedom Party. (While the terms &ldquo;neo-Nazi&rdquo; and &ldquo;white nationalist&rdquo; are often used interchangeably, neo-Nazism is actually only one type of white nationalism.) U.S. neo-Nazis also belong to racist skinhead and biker gangs, or participate in religious movements like Christian Identity and Creativity.</p>\n<p>For years, the NSM has been the furthest right stop on the political spectrum for a publicly facing group. If it collapses, this will produce a vacuum within the landscape of organized white supremacists. While the relevance of structured groups in political movements has declined, especially with the advent of online and wireless communications, they still serve a unique function. Obviously, a new group could assume its place that wishes to &ldquo;raise the swastika&rdquo; and dodge the inevitable rotten tomatoes.</p>\n<p>A worst-case scenario is that those neo-Nazis who in the past would join a public party and experience catharsis through attending public rallies will, instead, feel boxed in and vent their frustration through bombings and murders (such as the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre, which happened as this article was going to press). The lack of a public party could also encourage neo-Nazis to join the more decentralized groups, which are harder to track and more likely to encourage violence. Schoep himself seems to be looking toward forming a new group; he could team up with Matthew Heimbach, and both are proven organizers, although both have also been marred by significant scandals. On March 14, as this article was being prepared for publication, Heimbach announced on social media that he was <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/MichaelEHayden/status/1106249978115227650&source=gmail&ust=1553007688719000&usg=AFQjCNGo7blkSf6oPNX3Aq9jsrGgpWdjaQ\" href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelEHayden/status/1106249978115227650\">starting a &ldquo;new project&rdquo;</a> with &ldquo;comrades&rdquo; from Traditionalist Worker Party chapters and former members of several different organizations.</p>\n<p>And although the parts of the far right that hold public marches and rallies have taken several major blows, as long as Trump is president, he will continue to encourage white nationalist attitudes. And white nationalists will continue to take advantage of this favorable climate to push their own agenda, which is significantly more radical than Trump&rsquo;s. The white nationalist wing of the &ldquo;alt-right,&rdquo; and the neo-Nazis with it, have been brought to its knees. However, down is not out, and with almost two more years of a Trump presidency to go, a close eye should be kept on their next move.</p>\n<aside><a href=\"https://truthout.org/donate\"> <p>As attacks on women&rsquo;s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we&rsquo;re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever. </p> <p>At Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship. <b>But this is only sustainable if we have your support.</b> If you like what you&rsquo;re reading or just value what we do, will you take a few seconds to contribute to our work? </p>  Donate Now </a></aside>",

                "text": "For the first time in decades, it is possible that there will be no U.S. neo-Nazi party large enough to hold public rallies. In a story worthy of a plot-twisting HBO special, Black civil rights activist James Stern convinced the leader of the largest U.S. neo-Nazi party, the National Socialist Movement (NSM), to officially make him their president in order to help protect the party from a lawsuit. Afterward, he said, \u201cAs a Black man, I took over a neo-Nazi group and outsmarted them,\u201d and that he intends to dismantle the group from within.\nThe NSM is important for opponents of the far right to watch because it is the largest open neo-Nazi group in the United States. As such, it is the furthest stop for a public, organized group on the right wing of the political spectrum. And after the 2018 collapse of the Traditionalist Worker Party, another large fascist party, the NSM has been the only neo-Nazi group able to hold public demonstrations of even a moderate size.\nThis, in combination with several other recent events, marks the third major blow dealt to the white nationalist movement since 2016. The first was the wave of deplatforming after Charlottesville. (\u201cDeplatforming\u201d refers to the practice of cancelling digital and other services for certain political groups; for example, when PayPal cancels the accounts of racist groups.) The second was the March 2018 meltdown, when the Traditionalist Worker Party collapsed after a leadership sex scandal, and \u201calt-right\u201d leader Richard Spencer\u2019s college tour ended after a disastrous finale in Michigan.\nUncompromised, uncompromising news\nGet reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.\nAfter spring 2018, the energy shifted from the white nationalist wing of the \u201calt-right\u201d to the more moderate \u201calt-lite\u201d \u2014 which shares the white nationalists\u2019 conspiracy-fueled, Islamophobic vision, but doesn\u2019t call for a white ethnostate and allows in gay men, Jews, and people of color. But the alt-lite\u2019s reign was brief, especially for the Proud Boys, the largest and most violent of the alt-lite groups. In October 2018, 10 of its affiliates were arrested after a gang-style attack in New York City. Police had initially refused to make arrests but did so after the mayor and governor called for them to intervene. This spurred a leadership shakeup \u2014 founder Gavin McInnes resigned, and his first replacement lasted less than a week \u2014 and a change in public perceptions of the group. Media outlets, which previously referred to them as \u201cedgy right-wing provocateurs,\u201d now describe them as \u201cviolent extremists with ties to white nationalism.\u201d\nThe street fights that broke out across the country in 2017 and early 2018 between the far right and their antifascist opposition have waned. They now appear limited to the Pacific Northwest, where Joey Gibson\u2019s Patriot Prayer group had been working closely with the local Proud Boys. But this alliance, too, is now reeling from a one-two punch.\nThe first punch was an internal schism: Tusitala \u201cTiny\u201d Toese left Patriot Prayer for the Proud Boys. Toese had been Gibson\u2019s stalwart comrade, a main Patriot Prayer street-brawler, and a primary driver of the conflicts that usually occur in Portland, Oregon. The second punch was a series of indications that the cozy treatment that the area\u2019s far right has received from law enforcement may soon come to an end.\nDespite numerous arrests, Toese has remained on the street. Recently, communications were made public which showed that the Portland police had frequent and friendly contact with Patriot Prayer, and told them how to avoid arrest. At the same time, police used extreme measures against anti-fascists; at one demonstration they nearly killed one. According to The Guardian\u2018s Jason Wilson, Portland\u2019s mayor and some city councilors have promised an independent investigation into the police-Patriot Prayer relationship. New warrants have been issued against Toese and another Proud Boy, Donovon Flippo. Flippo has been arrested, while Toese is currently not in custody; on social media Toese has said he has gone to Samoa. All of this may finally signal a change in how Portland law enforcement treats the far right.\nIn other locations, the courts are not hesitating to impose stiff sentences on violent far-right activists. Tyler Tenbrink, who had shot at anti-racist protestors after a Richard Spencer talk in Gainesville, Florida, in 2017, received a 15-year sentence in February 2019.\nWhite supremacists in the government\u2019s ranks are also receiving attention. Christopher Hasson, a white nationalist and Coast Guard member, was arrested in February with a weapons cache; he had allegedly written that he was \u201cdreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth.\u201d And a Marine, Mason Edward Mead, is under investigation after he used social media to identify as a neo-Nazi and post a picture of TNT bricks laid out in the shape of a swastika.\nFinally, one of the last major \u201calt-right\u201d fascist groups, Identity Evropa, is reeling from over 770,000 internal messages being made public on March 6 by the radical media project Unicorn Riot. Many Identity Evropa members have already been doxed based on this information. The group immediately announced a name change, and is now the American Identity Movement. Identity Evropa had previously been successful as the largest \u201calt-right\u201d fascist group. It cultivated a mainstream look and appealed to college-educated, middle-class whites, and pursued a strategy of entryism into the Republican Party. They had also bragged it was a \u201csafe\u201d group for professionals, since relatively few members had previously been doxed.\nThe relationships \u2014 both between white nationalists and the alt-lite, as well as the far right in general and law enforcement \u2014 are significant because the far right cannot function without the aid of more mainstream conservatives. Robert Paxton\u2019s The Anatomy of Fascism shows how even Mussolini and Hitler relied on alliances with non-fascist conservatives to gain and keep power. In the United States, fascists have never been able to create a mass party. Where they have achieved limited success, they have needed sympathizers, collaborators and apologists from the more moderate factions of the right. The far right loves to use violence \u2014 but it can only do this if law enforcement permits.\nIn late 2016, there was a working alliance among the Trumpist Republicans, the alt-lite and Patriot movement, and the white nationalists and fascists. All of these separate parts of the far right flourished as they egged on and aided each other, united by their support of Trump. After Charlottesville, mainstream conservatives finally considered the explicit white nationalists off limits to openly align with, although the alt-lite was still widely seen as acceptable among Trumpist Republicans. After fall 2018, many of the alt-lite have been treated as increasingly toxic as well.\nThis said, it is worth looking specifically at what the explicitly neo-Nazi current is doing. Nazis, as well as other fascist currents, are the object of great fascination \u2014 both as the ultimate bad guy, and the most extreme end of conservative politics. But the actual political role of neo-Nazis in U.S. right-wing politics is complex.\nIt is a small movement; I could not find published figures, but, after looking at estimates from previous decades and talking to others who closely watch the far right, I think there are several thousand people who identify as Nazis in the U.S. today. On one hand, Nazism acts as the logical endpoint for those who advocate conservative social hierarchies. Many Republicans deny being racist, while deploying code words against oppressed groups and advocating policies that may sometimes look neutral but in fact disproportionately harm oppressed people. For these bigots, Nazism is a logical conclusion of their politics.\nOn the other hand, the Nazis\u2019 European-derived politics have always been out-of-step with the vast majority of U.S. conservatives. The fascist advocacy of a strong state clashes with U.S. conservative rhetoric against \u201cbig government.\u201d\nNazis do not just want \u201cmore\u201d racism and anti-Semitism, nor even just to replace the U.S. government with a radically different system; they want to transform modern society as we know it. This gives them an appeal to constituencies that regular conservatives don\u2019t usually reach, such as some skinheads, black metal fans and biker gangs. Some members of these groups are drawn to neo-Nazism specifically because of its reputation as the most extreme political position possible \u2014 one often depicted as evil incarnate.\nThis is true especially for Satanists like the Order of Nine Angles, who encourage members to join extremist political groups. They have become influential on the Atomwaffen Division, a U.S. neo-Nazi group whose affiliates killed five people in 2017 and 2018.\nMany neo-Nazis use the reaction they provoke as an organizing tool. This included George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the original American Nazi Party. In many ways, his politics were closer to ultra-conservatives like 1950s anti-Communist Senator Joseph McCarthy than to Adolf Hitler. But, fueled by anti-Semitism, Rockwell craftily manipulated the Nazi label for publicity. (To this day, neo-Nazism\u2019s bedrock of anti-Semitism has sometimes distinguished it from other kinds of white nationalism; for example, neo-Nazis have claimed that Jews are behind the removal of Confederate statues.) Rockwell wrote in 1967 that:\nThe Swastika and Hitler, far from being millstones, are actually the answer to the eternal problem of the right wing \u2014 money! \u2026 you can go into the streets and march and distribute homemade handbills and picket \u2014 for nothing. The Jews go wild, attack \u2014 and you then have free use of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of Jewish TV, newspapers, magazines, etc.\nIn the 1920s and \u201930s there was open pro-Nazi organizing in the United States, although this was suppressed during the war. Afterward, new groups inspired by the Nazis formed \u2014 but they eschewed the label. Rockwell condemned them as \u201cSneaky Nazis\u201d who hid their true beliefs. He garnered a huge amount of media attention by holding protests which took the opposite approach. But his group had less than a hundred members at its height, and he was assassinated in 1967 by a former member.\nAfter his murder, his party (which by then had changed its name to the National Socialist White People\u2019s Party, NSWPP) soon splintered. Some started promoting armed revolutionary warfare. Others took the \u201cSneaky Nazi\u201d route, trying to soft-sell their ideas to gain more mainstream acceptance. The party still exists today under yet another name, the New Order, although it has abandoned high-profile demonstrations for private events.\nSome Nazis sought to continue Rockwell\u2019s legacy of having a membership-based organization that held public rallies. For years, the NSM was the largest neo-Nazi group deploying this strategy. It was originally founded in the mid-1970s by several neo-Nazis who were former and current members of the American Nazi Party/NSWPP. It continued as a very small group until 1994, when they recruited Jeff Schoep, a young skinhead who took over and turned it into the party it is today \u2014 that is, at least until he was taken in by a Black man who outsmarted him.\nFor the last few years, the NSM has been searching for a new identity. Its rallies drew attention, but it was in a decaying orbit. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, in 2009 there were 61 NSM chapters; in 2018 it was down to six. The \u201calt-right\u201d clearly eclipsed them. New websites like Daily Stormer, and loosely organized groups like Atomwaffen Division, had caught the mood of youthful neo-Nazis.\nThe remainder of the NSM is already fragmenting. A legal filing appointed Stern the group\u2019s \u201cpresident/director,\u201d although this was initially kept a secret from the members. On a Russian social media site, Schoep announced he has stepped down as the \u201ccommander,\u201d and been replaced by Burt Colucci. Stern says he\u2019s going to keep the legal rights to the group\u2019s name, and use their website for Holocaust education. Even if the neo-Nazis can win a lawsuit against Stern and regain control, Colucci will inherit a compromised and much smaller organization.\nSo, with the Traditionalist Worker Party gone and the NSM in chaos, organized U.S. neo-Nazism is in disarray. The Atomwaffen Division has over two dozen affiliates but is undoubtedly under intense law enforcement surveillance and eschews public rallies. Vanguard America was a major \u201calt-right,\u201d neo-Nazi group until Charlottesville. Afterward, it was superseded by the Patriot Front, who disguise their true politics with traditional patriotic language \u2014 classic \u201cSneaky Nazis.\u201d The Daily Stormer has been driven to the dark web and its affiliated groups, which use the name \u201cBook Clubs\u201d (which they are not), are not lively organizations.\nOther neo-Nazis are in small groups like the New Order, as well as in splinter groups of current and former neo-Nazi groups. Some are members of broader white nationalist groups like American Identity Movement and the American Freedom Party. (While the terms \u201cneo-Nazi\u201d and \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d are often used interchangeably, neo-Nazism is actually only one type of white nationalism.) U.S. neo-Nazis also belong to racist skinhead and biker gangs, or participate in religious movements like Christian Identity and Creativity.\nFor years, the NSM has been the furthest right stop on the political spectrum for a publicly facing group. If it collapses, this will produce a vacuum within the landscape of organized white supremacists. While the relevance of structured groups in political movements has declined, especially with the advent of online and wireless communications, they still serve a unique function. Obviously, a new group could assume its place that wishes to \u201craise the swastika\u201d and dodge the inevitable rotten tomatoes.\nA worst-case scenario is that those neo-Nazis who in the past would join a public party and experience catharsis through attending public rallies will, instead, feel boxed in and vent their frustration through bombings and murders (such as the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre, which happened as this article was going to press). The lack of a public party could also encourage neo-Nazis to join the more decentralized groups, which are harder to track and more likely to encourage violence. Schoep himself seems to be looking toward forming a new group; he could team up with Matthew Heimbach, and both are proven organizers, although both have also been marred by significant scandals. On March 14, as this article was being prepared for publication, Heimbach announced on social media that he was starting a \u201cnew project\u201d with \u201ccomrades\u201d from Traditionalist Worker Party chapters and former members of several different organizations.\nAnd although the parts of the far right that hold public marches and rallies have taken several major blows, as long as Trump is president, he will continue to encourage white nationalist attitudes. And white nationalists will continue to take advantage of this favorable climate to push their own agenda, which is significantly more radical than Trump\u2019s. The white nationalist wing of the \u201calt-right,\u201d and the neo-Nazis with it, have been brought to its knees. However, down is not out, and with almost two more years of a Trump presidency to go, a close eye should be kept on their next move.\nAs attacks on women\u2019s rights, health care, the environment and democracy intensify, we\u2019re going to need truth-telling journalists more than ever.\nAt Truthout, unlike most media, our journalism is free from government and corporate influence and censorship.

I&rsquo;m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz&aacute;lez.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> Well, Minnesota freshman Congressmember Ilhan Omar says death threats against her have spiked in number since President Trump tweeted a video juxtaposing her image with footage of the 9/11 attacks. Trump posted the 43-second video Friday with the caption, &ldquo;WE WILL NEVER FORGET.&rdquo; The president&rsquo;s tweet intercut video of the World Trade Center towers burning with video of Omar speaking about the increasing attacks on the Muslim American community after 9/11. Omar was speaking at a Council on American-Islamic Relations event last month.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>REP. ILHAN OMAR:</strong> Far too long, we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen. And frankly, I&rsquo;m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> CAIR was in fact founded in 1994. Omar&rsquo;s spokesperson later said she misspoke and, quote, &ldquo;meant to refer to the fact that the organization had doubled in size after the Sept. 11 attacks,&rdquo; end of quote. Congressmember Omar&rsquo;s comments were originally taken out of context and circulated by right-wing media, from <em>The Daily Caller</em> to Fox News. In a statement, Congressmember Omar said, quote, &ldquo;Since the president&rsquo;s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life &mdash; many directly referencing or replying to the president&rsquo;s video. This is endangering lives. It has to stop.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside><h2>The stories you care about, right at your fingertips</h2> <p>Get Truthout&rsquo;s daily edition delivered to your inbox.</p>  </aside>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> The hashtag #StandWithIlhan trended as conservative voices continued to attack Congressmember Omar over the weekend. Trump said on Twitter Monday he&rsquo;s heading to Minnesota. Omar tweeted, &ldquo;The Great State of Minnesota, where we don&rsquo;t only welcome immigrants, we send them to Washington #NoBanAct.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In New York City, Yemeni bodega owners responded to the attacks against Congressmember Omar by announcing they&rsquo;re boycotting the sale and purchase of the <em>New York Post</em> over its front-page attack on Omar. The Murdoch-owned daily paper featured an image of the burning Twin Towers on 9/11, referencing Omar&rsquo;s comment out of context, &ldquo;9/11 Was &lsquo;Some People Did Something,&rsquo;&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Your Something&rdquo; in large print over the photo. The Yemeni American Merchants Association said the cover &ldquo;provoked hatred&rdquo; and targeted people of the Muslim faith.</p>\n<p>To talk more about Congressmember Ilhan Omar, we&rsquo;re joined by Moustafa Bayoumi, the author of <em>This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror</em>, his recent <em>Guardian</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/14/ilhan-omar-republicans-silence\">piece</a>headlined &ldquo;Ilhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.&rdquo; Moustafa Bayoumi is an English professor at Brooklyn College in the City University of New York, also the author of <em>How Does It Feel to Be a Problem? Being Young and Arab in America</em>.</p>\n<p>Welcome back to <em>Democracy Now!</em> It&rsquo;s great to have you with us. Talk about what others have said over time. This is the argument you make in your piece, &ldquo;Ilhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.&rdquo; Give us a few quotes.</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> Sure. Well, I mean, if you think &mdash; if you just have even a short-term memory, I think you can remember that George W. Bush, the former president of the United States, said something to the effect of &mdash; when referring to the 9/11 attackers, said something to the effect of, &ldquo;Well, these folks committed this act.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Wait. Actually, we&rsquo;ve got that clip.</p>\n<blockquote> <p><strong>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:</strong> &hellip; full resources of the federal government go to help the victims and their families and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> &ldquo;To find the folks who committed this act.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> Yeah. So, that, in &mdash; to my ear, that sounds quite similar to what Ilhan Omar said. And, in fact, George Bush is saying it to the whole country, and he&rsquo;s not considered to be anti-American for that statement whatsoever. So, in fact, I think what Ilhan Omar is saying is completely within the boundaries of what is normal political discourse in this country. And we could go one. That&rsquo;s one example.</p>\n<p>Another example would be Ilhan Omar is now accused of claiming that &mdash; her detractors will say that she claims that Jewish people in the United States suffer from a dual loyalty campaign. Well, in fact, actually, she did not say that. So, I think it&rsquo;s important to qualify what she did say and what she did not say. She talked about questions of allegiance. And if we listen to your last segment and we talk about anti-BDS laws, in fact, those are in fact allegiance laws that are built into now the very system of the United States. However, somebody did say something that was in fact claiming dual loyalty for Jewish Americans, and that would be our president now, Donald Trump.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> Explain what he said.</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> He said something to the effect of &mdash; when speaking to a Jewish American group, he said something about &mdash;</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> The Jewish Republican Coalition in Las Vegas last week.</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> In fact, that&rsquo;s right. And he said, &ldquo;Well, let me talk about your prime minister.&rdquo; So he referred to Benjamin Netanyahu as their prime minister.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> How do you account for this enormous campaign that has been launched against this freshman congressmember in terms of by so many conservatives and right-wing groups in the country and by the president himself? In your sense, what&rsquo;s behind it?</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> Well, on one level, it&rsquo;s very clear. Ilhan Omar is one of two Muslim women elected to Congress, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. That gives her, I think, a certain level of prominence, along with a certain level of vulnerability. Not only that, but, of course, being openly Muslim, she wears hijab. She covers her hair. She&rsquo;s a refugee. She&rsquo;s an immigrant. She&rsquo;s a black woman. So she occupies all of those vulnerable positions in our society today.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not only that, I believe, if you ask me, because if she were a quiet black refugee woman from Somalia, Muslim who covered her hair, and all of that stuff, then I think people would love to trot her out for the optics alone. But she&rsquo;s not a quiet congresswoman. In fact, I think that&rsquo;s a great thing. In fact, she seems to be a highly principled and highly effective politician, even just in the short time that she&rsquo;s been in Congress. So, I think that, in fact, she&rsquo;s a scary figure to a lot of people who are on the right, and even sometimes to the mainstream establishment of the Democratic Party, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>JUAN GONZ&Aacute;LEZ:</strong> That was going to be my follow-up. What about the reaction of the establishment of the Democratic Party to the threats against her and to the scapegoating of her?</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> Yes. Well, you know, I think that what we saw was in fact, in some ways, a litmus test of where the Democratic leadership and also those vying for the presidency lie on one of the more important issues of our day, which is Islamophobia, fundamentally. What we saw with Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s statement, for example, on Ilhan Omar was, I thought, extremely disappointing. I thought she was refusing to name Ilhan Omar explicitly, was not &mdash; didn&rsquo;t come out in her defense, and in fact was backhandedly accusing her of sacralizing &mdash; or, desacralizing, I should say, the 9/11 territory, which was not the point of this controversy at all. So, I thought that Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s response was, in fact, quite shameful.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And now she&rsquo;s being attacked for criticizing Stephen Miller for his fierce anti-immigrant views, being told that because she&rsquo;s talking about Stephen Miller in the administration, she is singling out a Jewish member of the administration, which proves she is anti-Semitic. We had on Dr. David Glosser, who is Stephen Miller&rsquo;s uncle, his sister&rsquo;s son, who criticized his nephew for his extremist anti-immigrant views.</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> Yeah, exactly. I mean, does that mean that Ilhan Omar can only criticize Ilhan Omar? That would be the natural result of that. She&rsquo;s not criticizing Stephen Miller for his Jewishness. She&rsquo;s criticizing Stephen Miller for the positions that he holds. And that&rsquo;s completely within the boundaries of American political discourse.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> So what does this mean for Muslims around the country? Ilhan Omar says she herself has faced this spike in death threats against her. President Trump pinning the tweet of the video where he&rsquo;s juxtaposed the 9/11 attacks with Ilhan Omar? We know about the attacks on the Tree of Life synagogue, the 11 Jewish worshipers that were killed, with the killer citing the same words that President Trump used &mdash; &rdquo;invaders,&rdquo; &ldquo;invasion.&rdquo; President Trump&rsquo;s words and what he tweets has meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI:</strong> Absolutely. In fact, there was a study that was performed last year &mdash; that was published last year, that said that there&rsquo;s a direct correlation with Donald Trump&rsquo;s anti-Muslim tweets and the rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes. So, Twitter and hate crimes, unfortunately, are connected. And they&rsquo;re not only connected in the United States, they&rsquo;re connected internationally, as well. That&rsquo;s what the study found. And, in fact, not only is what Donald Trump tweeted completely disturbing, but it&rsquo;s also coming within weeks of 50 people being killed in New Zealand in two different mosques by a man who also felt himself connected to President Trump and his ideology.</p>\n<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And let&rsquo;s not forget what the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern responded to President Trump when he asked what can he do, when he called the prime minister, and she said, &ldquo;Respect the Muslim community,&rdquo; as she then put on hijab herself to comfort the families of those killed.

I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Well, Minnesota freshman Congressmember Ilhan Omar says death threats against her have spiked in number since President Trump tweeted a video juxtaposing her image with footage of the 9/11 attacks. Trump posted the 43-second video Friday with the caption, \u201cWE WILL NEVER FORGET.\u201d The president\u2019s tweet intercut video of the World Trade Center towers burning with video of Omar speaking about the increasing attacks on the Muslim American community after 9/11. Omar was speaking at a Council on American-Islamic Relations event last month.\nREP. ILHAN OMAR: Far too long, we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen. And frankly, I\u2019m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: CAIR was in fact founded in 1994. Omar\u2019s spokesperson later said she misspoke and, quote, \u201cmeant to refer to the fact that the organization had doubled in size after the Sept. 11 attacks,\u201d end of quote. Congressmember Omar\u2019s comments were originally taken out of context and circulated by right-wing media, from The Daily Caller to Fox News. In a statement, Congressmember Omar said, quote, \u201cSince the president\u2019s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life \u2014 many directly referencing or replying to the president\u2019s video. This is endangering lives. It has to stop.\u201d\nThe stories you care about, right at your fingertips\nGet Truthout\u2019s daily edition delivered to your inbox.\nAMY GOODMAN: The hashtag #StandWithIlhan trended as conservative voices continued to attack Congressmember Omar over the weekend. Trump said on Twitter Monday he\u2019s heading to Minnesota. Omar tweeted, \u201cThe Great State of Minnesota, where we don\u2019t only welcome immigrants, we send them to Washington #NoBanAct.\u201d\nIn New York City, Yemeni bodega owners responded to the attacks against Congressmember Omar by announcing they\u2019re boycotting the sale and purchase of the New York Post over its front-page attack on Omar. The Murdoch-owned daily paper featured an image of the burning Twin Towers on 9/11, referencing Omar\u2019s comment out of context, \u201c9/11 Was \u2018Some People Did Something,\u2019\u201d and the words \u201cHere\u2019s Your Something\u201d in large print over the photo. The Yemeni American Merchants Association said the cover \u201cprovoked hatred\u201d and targeted people of the Muslim faith.\nTo talk more about Congressmember Ilhan Omar, we\u2019re joined by Moustafa Bayoumi, the author of This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror, his recent Guardian pieceheadlined \u201cIlhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.\u201d Moustafa Bayoumi is an English professor at Brooklyn College in the City University of New York, also the author of How Does It Feel to Be a Problem? Being Young and Arab in America.\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! It\u2019s great to have you with us. Talk about what others have said over time. This is the argument you make in your piece, \u201cIlhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.\u201d Give us a few quotes.\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Sure. Well, I mean, if you think \u2014 if you just have even a short-term memory, I think you can remember that George W. Bush, the former president of the United States, said something to the effect of \u2014 when referring to the 9/11 attackers, said something to the effect of, \u201cWell, these folks committed this act.\u201d\nAMY GOODMAN: Wait. Actually, we\u2019ve got that clip.\nPRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: \u2026 full resources of the federal government go to help the victims and their families and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act.\nAMY GOODMAN: \u201cTo find the folks who committed this act.\u201d\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yeah. So, that, in \u2014 to my ear, that sounds quite similar to what Ilhan Omar said. And, in fact, George Bush is saying it to the whole country, and he\u2019s not considered to be anti-American for that statement whatsoever. So, in fact, I think what Ilhan Omar is saying is completely within the boundaries of what is normal political discourse in this country. And we could go one. That\u2019s one example.\nAnother example would be Ilhan Omar is now accused of claiming that \u2014 her detractors will say that she claims that Jewish people in the United States suffer from a dual loyalty campaign. Well, in fact, actually, she did not say that. So, I think it\u2019s important to qualify what she did say and what she did not say. She talked about questions of allegiance. And if we listen to your last segment and we talk about anti-BDS laws, in fact, those are in fact allegiance laws that are built into now the very system of the United States. However, somebody did say something that was in fact claiming dual loyalty for Jewish Americans, and that would be our president now, Donald Trump.\nAMY GOODMAN: Explain what he said.\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: He said something to the effect of \u2014 when speaking to a Jewish American group, he said something about \u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: The Jewish Republican Coalition in Las Vegas last week.\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: In fact, that\u2019s right. And he said, \u201cWell, let me talk about your prime minister.\u201d So he referred to Benjamin Netanyahu as their prime minister.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: How do you account for this enormous campaign that has been launched against this freshman congressmember in terms of by so many conservatives and right-wing groups in the country and by the president himself? In your sense, what\u2019s behind it?\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Well, on one level, it\u2019s very clear. Ilhan Omar is one of two Muslim women elected to Congress, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. That gives her, I think, a certain level of prominence, along with a certain level of vulnerability. Not only that, but, of course, being openly Muslim, she wears hijab. She covers her hair. She\u2019s a refugee. She\u2019s an immigrant. She\u2019s a black woman. So she occupies all of those vulnerable positions in our society today.\nBut it\u2019s not only that, I believe, if you ask me, because if she were a quiet black refugee woman from Somalia, Muslim who covered her hair, and all of that stuff, then I think people would love to trot her out for the optics alone. But she\u2019s not a quiet congresswoman. In fact, I think that\u2019s a great thing. In fact, she seems to be a highly principled and highly effective politician, even just in the short time that she\u2019s been in Congress. So, I think that, in fact, she\u2019s a scary figure to a lot of people who are on the right, and even sometimes to the mainstream establishment of the Democratic Party, as well.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: That was going to be my follow-up. What about the reaction of the establishment of the Democratic Party to the threats against her and to the scapegoating of her?\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yes. Well, you know, I think that what we saw was in fact, in some ways, a litmus test of where the Democratic leadership and also those vying for the presidency lie on one of the more important issues of our day, which is Islamophobia, fundamentally. What we saw with Nancy Pelosi\u2019s statement, for example, on Ilhan Omar was, I thought, extremely disappointing. I thought she was refusing to name Ilhan Omar explicitly, was not \u2014 didn\u2019t come out in her defense, and in fact was backhandedly accusing her of sacralizing \u2014 or, desacralizing, I should say, the 9/11 territory, which was not the point of this controversy at all. So, I thought that Nancy Pelosi\u2019s response was, in fact, quite shameful.\nAMY GOODMAN: And now she\u2019s being attacked for criticizing Stephen Miller for his fierce anti-immigrant views, being told that because she\u2019s talking about Stephen Miller in the administration, she is singling out a Jewish member of the administration, which proves she is anti-Semitic. We had on Dr. David Glosser, who is Stephen Miller\u2019s uncle, his sister\u2019s son, who criticized his nephew for his extremist anti-immigrant views.\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yeah, exactly. I mean, does that mean that Ilhan Omar can only criticize Ilhan Omar? That would be the natural result of that. She\u2019s not criticizing Stephen Miller for his Jewishness. She\u2019s criticizing Stephen Miller for the positions that he holds. And that\u2019s completely within the boundaries of American political discourse.\nAMY GOODMAN: So what does this mean for Muslims around the country? Ilhan Omar says she herself has faced this spike in death threats against her. President Trump pinning the tweet of the video where he\u2019s juxtaposed the 9/11 attacks with Ilhan Omar? We know about the attacks on the Tree of Life synagogue, the 11 Jewish worshipers that were killed, with the killer citing the same words that President Trump used \u2014 \u201dinvaders,\u201d \u201cinvasion.\u201d President Trump\u2019s words and what he tweets has meaning.\nMOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Absolutely. In fact, there was a study that was performed last year \u2014 that was published last year, that said that there\u2019s a direct correlation with Donald Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim tweets and the rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes. So, Twitter and hate crimes, unfortunately, are connected. And they\u2019re not only connected in the United States, they\u2019re connected internationally, as well. That\u2019s what the study found. And, in fact, not only is what Donald Trump tweeted completely disturbing, but it\u2019s also coming within weeks of 50 people being killed in New Zealand in two different mosques by a man who also felt himself connected to President Trump and his ideology.\nAMY GOODMAN: And let\u2019s not forget what the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern responded to President Trump when he asked what can he do, when he called the prime minister, and she said, \u201cRespect the Muslim community,\u201d as she then put on hijab herself to comfort the families of those killed.

Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad bad. Bad.\nThis is bad policy that will *NOT* save lives and will hurt chronic pain patients \u2014 including driving people to commit suicide. We\u2019ve seen this happen before. https://t.co/DDpCHWZdWU\n\u2014 Abraham Gutman (@abgutman) March 19, 2019\n@SenGillibrand if you are interested, I would love to connect your team with experts and share some data about why policies such as the prescription limits that you are proposing do more harm than good. I\u2019m at agutman@philly.com.\n\u2014 Abraham Gutman (@abgutman) March 19, 2019\nHer \u201cteam of experts\u201d \u2014 good one.\nJust a couple of weeks ago more than 300 experts wrote a letter to the CDC about their Rx guidelines. The takeaway: limiting opioid prescription drives people who are suffering from pain to find illicit alternatives and commit suicide. @SenGillibrand https://t.co/18MqVu3v2s pic.twitter.com/cYuZAWb6Xh\n\u2014 Abraham Gutman (@abgutman) March 19, 2019\nBetween 2006 and 2017, the opioid prescription rate went down by about 20 percent nationally. At the same time the overdose deaths more than doubled. Most of those deaths involve illicit fentanyl, not Rx.\nWe shouldn\u2019t push people toward more dangerous substances. @SenGillibrand pic.twitter.com/YJNEcCIGSE\n\u2014 Abraham Gutman (@abgutman) March 19, 2019\nDoctors are already afraid to prescribe opioids; they don\u2019t need the government interfering any further.\nWhy would a prescription limit on *acute* pain harm chronic-pain patients? Because of CDC guidelines & state prescription limits, many people in chronic pain depend on diverted pills. Without them, the only option left is illicit fentanyl and the risk of overdose death.\n\u2014 Abraham Gutman (@abgutman) March 19, 2019\nWe also don\u2019t want to further promote a culture of hyper-surveillance on doctors\u2019 prescription that would incentivize bad medicine and not giving painkillers to people in chronic pain to avoid getting in trouble with the DEA \u2014 this is already happening.\n\u2014 Abraham Gutman (@abgutman) March 19, 2019\nYep.\nIt is also important to note that prescriptions don\u2019t tell the full story of the cause of the addiction and overdose crisis. Everyone should read @ZachWritesStuff\u2019s masterful essay on the problem w/ the supply side story. https://t.co/8Hpu76P6G3 @SenGillibrand pic.twitter.com/DEV8nJQyIM\n\u2014 Abraham Gutman (@abgutman) March 19, 2019\nTo see the root causes of addiction, we need to look honestly at trauma and despair in America today. It is policies like the Green New Deal that will defeat addiction by replacing despair with hope. That\u2019s how we get out of this crisis. https://t.co/Ax8AxcYHqb @SenGillibrand\n\u2014 Abraham Gutman (@abgutman) March 19, 2019\nOK, you totally lost us there; the threat of creeping socialism is what causes us despair, but go on.\nI believe that just like any other medical treatment, the standard of care for pain and addiction should be set by professional association guidelines (@AmericanPainSoc / @ASAMorg / @AmerMedicalAssn) and not legislated. https://t.co/ycMe5syVCv\n\u2014 Abraham Gutman (@abgutman) March 19, 2019\nDo you also think disability/pain suffering patients should also have a seat at that table?\n(I'm not challenging you on this, just asking for clarity because I didn't see it mentioned\u2013but it's also Twitter and 280 characters limits things.)\n\u2014 Everything is political. (@policyprimate) March 19, 2019\n10000000000% yes. I would expect that any one of these groups will include input from the people who will be impacted by the guidelines in making the guidelines\n\u2014 Abraham Gutman (@abgutman) March 19, 2019\nSeeing as Gillibrand changes her policy positions every day, it would be good to have the input of people who live with pain every day.\nChronic pain sufferer over here who doesn't abuse my meds wants to tell you to F off & keep the govt. out of my Dr. office but I don't curse so I'll just say bless your heart. I honestly hope you never experience real pain. It's not fun. https://t.co/VRlRtjArY4\n\u2014 Artist_Angie: Sensei of Sarcasm (@Artist_Angie) March 20, 2019\nRelated:\n'What a damn monster'!

We certainly didn\u2019t know that she had her own self-published children\u2019s book series called \u201cHealthy Holly,\u201d for one thing. And the Baltimore Sun has been looking into that publishing deal and finding some shady dealings.\nFirst, let reporter Alec MacGillis introduce you to \u201cHealthy Holly.\u201d\nGet this: Baltimore Mayor Cathy Pugh, who sits on the board of the University of Maryland Medical System, sold 20,000 copies of her children's book \"Healthy Holly: Exercising is Fun\" to the hospital. Her profit: $100,000. @lukebroadwater: https://t.co/XTnawYZM7b\n\u2014 Alec MacGillis (@AlecMacGillis) March 14, 2019\n\u2026Making her the highest earning healthy kids book author ever.\n\u2014 Rebekah Sanderlin (@rsanderlin) March 14, 2019\nHuh.\nHere it is. Only four left at Amazon. Hospital must've gotten them all. pic.twitter.com/tV0uOyV52m\n\u2014 Alec MacGillis (@AlecMacGillis) March 14, 2019\nNot quite, but we\u2019ll get to that.\nWhoa. I previously noted here that Baktimore Mayor Catherine Pugh had sold 20,000 copies of her self-published children's book to the U of MD Medical System, on whose board she sits.\nTurns out it was actually 100,000 copies! At a total cost of $500,000. https://t.co/Lw7uoxe3Bf\n\u2014 Alec MacGillis (@AlecMacGillis) March 15, 2019\nAgain, just so we're clear what sort of book we're talking about: pic.twitter.com/srVhRfJe1t\n\u2014 Alec MacGillis (@AlecMacGillis) March 15, 2019\nMaybe it\u2019s just a really great book. But wait, there\u2019s more!\nBaltimore school system spokeswoman: Roughly 8,700 copies of Mayor Catherine Pugh's \"Healthy Holly: Fruits Come in Colors Like the Rainbow\" books are currently sitting in a district warehouse. pic.twitter.com/JJXv1XiDGl\n\u2014 Talia Richman (@TaliRichman) March 18, 2019\nThe U of MD Medical System bought 100K copies of the Baltimore mayor's children's books, at a cost of $500,000, while she was on the system's board.\nToday's latest: 8,700 of the books are sitting in the city school district warehouse. They were \"unsolicited,\" says the district. https://t.co/NuGPAvSCdv\n\u2014 Alec MacGillis (@AlecMacGillis) March 19, 2019\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! \u201cHealthy Holly\u201d is very generous with her money.\nWhat we already knew:\nThe U of MD Medical System paid Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh $500K for 100K copies of her Healthy Holly children's book while Pugh was on the system's board.\nAnd now this: Pugh funneled $5K from Healthy Holly LLC into her campaign.https://t.co/GSkBWLCpFD\n\u2014 Alec MacGillis (@AlecMacGillis) March 19, 2019\nMacGillis reports:\nBaltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh\u2019s book company has given $7,040 in state political contributions since 2015 \u2014 including a $5,000 gift to her own campaign.\n\u2026\nThe mayor did not return messages seeking comment about the contributions Tuesday.\nPugh resigned this week from the University of Maryland Medical System\u2019s board of directors after coming under fire for failing to fully disclose the $500,000 business relationship she had with the system, which bought 100,000 copies of her self-published children\u2019s book series, \u201cHealthy Holly.\u201d\nSo the University of Maryland Medical System buys 100,000 copies of the mayor\u2019s self-published book while she\u2019s on the board of directors, and then she dips into the book sales to fund her campaign? While thousands of unsolicited copies sit in a school warehouse? Could a reporter at least see the books?\nNo.\nNew story from @BaltimoreBrew on the warehouse where the 8700 Healthy Holly books are located.\nJust saying \u2026 if you want to conceal evidence of a crime, a building \u201cnot set up for a lot of traffic in and out\u201d is about as good as it gets. #mdga19 #mdpolitics pic.twitter.com/dMkZdVbUDF\n\u2014 Change Annapolis PAC (@AnnapolisChange) March 19, 2019\nWe visited the gritty Pulaski Hwy warehouse where 8,700 of @MayorPugh50's Healthy Holly books are said to be sitting. \"It isn't set up for visitors,\" @BaltCitySchools said, turning us away. https://t.co/l1h6AEOggQ pic.twitter.com/4bZIXkf2qz\n\u2014 Baltimore Brew (@BaltimoreBrew) March 19, 2019\nFOUND: 8,700 copies of @MayorPugh50's Healthy Holly books.\nWHERE: in a @BaltCitySchools warehouse.\nSTILL MISSING: 71,300 books supposedly distributed to city schoolchildren as part of $500K deal between mayor and UMMS. https://t.co/JltkwJpt2g pic.twitter.com/ZyzwGnlUGz\n\u2014 Baltimore Brew (@BaltimoreBrew) March 18, 2019\n\"The 'Healthy Holly' sales inevitably raise suspicion in the public\u2019s mind that UMMS was buying a pliant (and particularly influential) board member, that Mayor Pugh was profiting off the prestige of her office, or both.\"https://t.co/CtRL00GH7w\n\u2014 Colin Campbell (@cmcampbell6) March 19, 2019\nPart of Healthy Holly\u2019s fitness routine must include running away from scandal.\n\u2014 Larry Smith \ud83d\udc7d (@ljsmith3663) March 18, 2019\nFind a man who looks at you the way Healthy Holly's dad looks at her mom as he reaches the bike past the psychedelic flower in the children's book that Baltimore's mayor sold 100,000 copies of for $500,000 to the medical system on whose board she sat. pic.twitter.com/a57uTcrf8F\n\u2014 Alec MacGillis (@AlecMacGillis) March 19, 2019\nI clearly do not understand how children\u2019s publishing works.\n\u2014 Laura Lippman (@LauraMLippman) March 19, 2019\nIt\u2019s apparently very profitable.\nRelated:\nPopular mayor concludes that the NRA thinks \u2018rocket launchers\u2019 are good for Baltimore https://t.co/4PQr2l7pCu\n\u2014 Twitchy Team (@TwitchyTeam) December 28, 2018",

But it was a town hall and she had to answer (or pivot away from) the questions she got, and when she was asked about reparations, she seemed all for it and thought there were a lot of ways to pay for it \u2014 but most importantly, the country had to have a national conversation.\nShe\u2019s doubling down on that surprise campaign issue, and this national conversation we\u2019re going to have about reparations? It has to be a full-blown conversation, with a congressional panel heading it up.\nSlavery is a stain on America & we need to address it head on. I believe it\u2019s time to start a national, full-blown conversation about reparations. I support the bill in the House to support a congressional panel of experts so that our nation can do what\u2019s right & begin to heal.\n\u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) March 19, 2019\nIt\u2019s not surprising Warren is so concerned with slavery considering what her own ancestors endured at the hands of the white invaders.\nSo the timeline is to convene a congressional panel of \u201cexperts,\u201d have a full-blown conversation about reparations, and then do what we can to begin to heal.\nNothing better for beginning to heal than tearing open a wound from 150 years ago.\n\u2014 Anthony Bialy (@AnthonyBialy) March 19, 2019\nSo what percentage of African American blood do you need for reparations?\nSo the non-guilty can be forced to pay the non-injured, generations later? And how will that help anything?\n\u2014 Amy Peikoff \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@AmyPeikoff) March 19, 2019\nReparations are the wrong way to go. No one alive today are direct victims of slavery. The only thing reparations will do is add resentment and cost money. We need true reform to help all underprivileged, not just descendents of slaves.\n\u2014 Simon Humphrey (@psymunsez) March 19, 2019\n\u2014 Louis Mangone (@LouisMangone) March 19, 2019\nNot a single person alive was a slave or slave owner. Punishing groups for a crime they did not not commit is playing identity politics for attention and your selfish power gain. You are creating further division.\n\u2014 Chuck J. Rylant (@ChuckRylant) March 19, 2019\nNow this I can not agree upon. None of my ancestors owned slaves. So because I'm white, I'm expected to make reparations towards something my family had nothing to do with? Most Americans have the same history as mine. Slavery is in the past. We need to move on.\n\u2014 Georgianna (Georgie) (@_Georgianna_K_) March 19, 2019\nMy ancestors came to this country four generations ago. Neither I nor any of my relatives or ancestors were slaves or slave owners. Why are we either liable for the payment or acceptance of 'reparations'?\n\u2014 Jack Rutherford (@jack_rutherford) March 19, 2019\nWhat are the basic logistics of this plan? Help me understand why my tax dollars should pay for sins committed 350-130 years before I was born, how much I will pay, who it will be paid to, why they deserve to be paid, and the goal this aims to achieve. Bumper sticker politics\u2026\nMan thats the most pandering pander I've ever seen. \"Ill get you free money if you vote for me\" LOL. This is the equivalent of those pop up ads saying you won a free cruise or $200 amazon gift card\n\u2014 Mitchell (@Mitchellkoehn86) March 19, 2019\nI\u2019m not gonna speak for my fellow Black Americans but as for me I don\u2019t want reparations. I want an end to racism so my kids will grow as equals without fear and without being judged.\nSocialism is today\u2019s slavery. I agree, we need to address it now before it enslaves is all.\n\u2014 Mosreg (@theRealConPOV) March 19, 2019\nHoly pandering, Batman!\nIf Democrats promote this, they will lose the presidential election.\n\u2014 Andrej Marcel \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7f \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea (@AndrejMarcel) March 19, 2019\nIf Elizabeth Warren is the nominee, Democrats will lose the presidential election regardless.\nAre you hitting the peace pipe again?\n\u2014 Laura Kronen (@beyouonlybetter) March 19, 2019\nTwo of my children are adopted from Africa, so I\u2019ll just cover their reparations & we\u2019ll call it \u2018good\u2019 if that\u2019s ok w you, Liz. \ud83d\udc4d\n\u2014 jason gallagher (@anotherdrj) March 19, 2019\n\u201cIm incredibly unlikeable but you may get free money if you vote for me\u201d\n\u2014 Matt LaFemina (@MLaFem) March 19, 2019\nThis is called buying votes.\n\u2014 Doug Stalcup (@Dougstalcup) March 19, 2019\nWhen you can find a \u201cpanel of experts\u201d , which are all former slaves during that time period in America, count me in.\n\u201cCongressional panel of experts\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026 as if such a thing can possibly ever exist.\n\u2014 Anthony Lewis (@anto_lewis) March 19, 2019\nEverything gets solved once Congress gets involved.

The ACLU decided to make its argument against the question in the form of an \u201celevator pitch,\u201d or a discussion no longer than the time it takes to ride an elevator.\nWe watched the video, but now we really want that question on there. They say correctly that the census is used to decide how many representatives a state gets, and then estimate that 6.5 million people won\u2019t fill out the census if the citizenship question is on there \u2014 more people than the population of Tennessee. We\u2019re not that hot on an imaginary 16th largest state being represented in Congress.\nIs it bad that we don\u2019t think non-citizens should count toward the number of representatives a state gets? California certainly wants those representatives, not to mention federal funds for social services.\nWe're headed to the Supreme Court next week to protect the 2020 census.\nHere's everything that's wrong with the citizenship question \u2014 in the time it takes for @ikebarinholtz to ride an elevator: pic.twitter.com/GPfzpesEqP\nCute video.

They are paid for using money that was usually ill-gotten and at the cost of black and brown lives via the prison industrial complex, the spoils of war, etc. Libraries filled with mostly white collections indicates that we don\u2019t care about what POC think, we don\u2019t care to hear from POC themselves, we don\u2019t consider POC to be scholars, we don\u2019t think POC are as valuable, knowledgeable, or as important as white people.\nHey, don\u2019t look at us \u2014 we\u2019re not librarians. Blame yourselves.\nUnfortunately, Sofia Leung is not a parodist, but Titania McGrath is:\nIf white parents simply raised their children as illiterate, they\u2019d stop producing so many books and our libraries would flourish. pic.twitter.com/c6sbvKcs5F\n\u2014 Titania McGrath (@TitaniaMcGrath) April 17, 2019\nSounds like the problem is racist librarians.\nExactly.\nMore likely, they just need to find more authors who are black.\n\u2014 DarthMallard\ud83e\udd86\u2757\ufe0f (@drumhellor) April 17, 2019\nNailed it again.\n\u2014 Ty Caldwell (@prestoncaldwell) April 17, 2019\n\u2014 First Lord of the Space Force Admiralty (@Noah_Pology) April 17, 2019\nWe should start burning books by all white authors until we balance things out.

Burn it for the good of humanity!!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\nOf course if you locked up white kids inside libraries then set them on fire, you'd get rid of both the past, present and future of whiteness.

We realize Democrats have like a dozen talking points they push over and over again regardless of the situation but c\u2019mon.\n68% of all NYC public school students are Black or Latino.\nTo only have 7 Black students accepted into Stuyvesant (a *public* high school) tells us that this is a system failure.\nEducation inequity is a major factor in the racial wealth gap. This is what injustice looks like. https://t.co/89NKvXk4vg\n\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 19, 2019\nHuh?\nSystem failure. Didn\u2019t she just say the majority of kids in public schools are Black and Latino? So if it\u2019s a system failure \u2026 wait, what?\nWe should know better than to try and make sense of her tweets, ignore us.\nIt is called earning it. Stuyvesant has 74 percent Asian students. Do you want more white kids in the school? Your idea is if you cannot earn it you force the school to take unqualified kids.\nThis is not what injustice looks like. It is what merit looks like.\n\u2014 Carmine Sabia (@CarmineSabia) March 19, 2019\nOof.\nWe\u2019re thinking AOC didn\u2019t do her homework on Stuyvesant \u2026\nLol! The school is only 22% white!\nCongratulations, you've played yourself. https://t.co/2EKoRXX5zR\n\u2014 Boomieleaks (@notwokieleaks) March 19, 2019\nAnother day, another AOC fail.\nHey, we suppose if this somehow works for her she should go with it and hey, who are we to complain? We get to write about her being a doorknob \u2026 again. Whoohoo for job security! Wait, AOC is accidentally creating jobs, who knew?\nHa!\nEquality of opportunity doesn't mean equality of outcome\u2026\n\u2014 Harry Gato (@harrygato) March 19, 2019\nBut that\u2019s not FAAAAAIR.\nSo, as someone who worked in education, let me ask\u2026\nHow do we ensure parental involvement, role modeling, etc. in our public schools? The number one issue I see is a lack of that, which is unfortunately heavily tired to lower incomes as well. To me, this is a key issue.\n\u2014 DouglasTerborg (@DougTerborg) March 19, 2019\nGood point. If AOC really wants to tackle the issues in public education going the lazy \u2018racist system\u2019 route isn\u2019t the answer. It\u2019s a far bigger issue.\nCongratulations to those 7 students for having the test scores necessary to get into Stuy. Not an easy feat. \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd73\n\u2014 We the Internet TV (@WeTheInternetTV) March 19, 2019\nDesirability, merit, logistics, neighborhood demographics just might play a role too. So unless a bunch of white liberals are cheating, again, you might have jumped the gun on this one.\n\u2014 Jesse Locke (@Americanb4Black) March 19, 2019\nHrm.\nNice too see the left going after Asian privilege now!\n\u2014 Voice of reason (@scottwalters007) March 19, 2019\nYou know what? Nope.\nCan\u2019t. Even.\nRelated:\nSuch BRAVERY! Rep. Eric Swalwell brags that he\u2019ll stop Trump by out-maneuvering him with his mind and OMG-ROFL",

                "text": "For months now we\u2019ve listened as AOC and this new crop of Democrats spread fear and rhetoric about how the world will END IN 12 YEARS (or would that be 11 YEARS and nine months now?) if we don\u2019t give up planes and hamburgers and accept the magical GREEN NEW DEAL.\nAnd for months we\u2019ve been making fun of these same people claiming the end is nigh so they can control how we live.\nIf you ever wanted a serious history lesson about this \u2018Green New Deal\u2019 and ultimately about how Democrats function (and how damn sneaky they are), look no further than this lengthy but entirely worthwhile thread from @ScotsFyre.\nThe #GreenNewDeal is a hot pile of garbage IMHO. In the name of the environment, it upends our economic system and encodes a bunch of social justice twaddle that has little to with any definition of \"justice\" ever. Lots of chest thumping about who is responsible for this /1\nSocial justice twaddle.\nHeh.\nmonstrosity. But seriously, where did it come from? Especially this WWII mobilization crap? Well, it was NOT Best Supporting Actress Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, the Justice Democrats or Bernie Sanders. Let's take a little trip, shall we? /2\nSo wait, climate change isn\u2019t just an AOC thing? GTFO!\nHere is Michael Harrington, founder of the DSA in 1988. He is basically saying danger leads to the opportunity to implement large scale government programs. The idea that a crisis is required to push the far left's agenda is not new. /3https://t.co/22cg6LQVmU\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nLooks a little bit like Bill Nye\u2019s grandpa.\nUnfortunately, for them, these large scale crises have not materialized. And the financial collapse he predicted did not happen. Now we have a climate crisis carefully placed in the mid-range future, for the 10th time. It's honestly like a bad rerun. /4\n10th time?\nHowever, the first time a wartime mobilization was proposed, was by a policy analyst, Lester Brown, in the Department of Agriculture. He was really worried about the Chinese having enough to eat. As late as 2012 he was writing about food scarcity. /5https://t.co/zJmyGL20ZS\nStudies are showing that as Chinese citizens make economic gains, their diet improves. They no longer have to rely on solely local food sources and agriculture techniques have improved dramatically. But even the Chinese eating better is now problematic. /6https://t.co/xNLKoJn2E9\nAnyway, next, Canadian professor Dennis Bartels published the first academic paper discussing climate mobilization in 2001. Brown\u2019s 2009 book, \u201cPlan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization,\u201d calls for a WWII-scale mobilization that reduces global emissions 80% by 2020. /7\nYikes.\nIn the meantime, in a 2007 campaign speech, Hillary Clinton said, \u201cFor this generation of Americans, climate change is our Space Race. It is our home front mobilization during World War II and it is our response to the Great Depression trying to express the urgency. /8\nAwww, there\u2019s ol\u2019 Cankles, doing her part.\nOf course, Al Gore got in on the action. In 2008 he compared the \u201cbattle against climate change to fighting the Nazis during World War II,\u201d in a speech. Hey, he won a Noble Peace Prize for being 100% wrong, so we should listen right? /9\nHA! We totally forgot he won \u2026 what a silly award that\u2019s turned into.\nThe rhetoric continued, but the first time a Green New Deal was proposed in a national political campaign was Jill Stein in 2012. In a tweet, she claimed the idea originated with a perennial gubernatorial candidate in NY in 2010. /10https://t.co/Hh4XFNqelA\nHere is some background on Howie Huber. In his run for Governor in 2010 where he proposed a like policy, The Socialist Party of New York endorsed him. Shocking, right? /11https://t.co/4H0SLQLzf9\nWe feel shocked.\nBack to Jill Stein. Here she is on CSPAN discussing her central proposal in her campaign for President, the Green New Deal. It also calls for Medicare for all and eliminating private insurance. As well as free college tuition. /12https://t.co/hZDcKkDl5P\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nThis sounds strangely familiar.\nHere is her campaign video. Stein was using a jobs crisis and a climate crisis as the basis of her proposal. You'll note AOC still tries to do this with jobs and it is pretty much a non-starter. /13https://t.co/DCdSPJ2jhd\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nIn 2016 she continued to push the Green New Deal as a policy proposal. Here is her 2016 campaign site that outlines the policy. Does it look familiar to you? /14https://t.co/kbC31HnZWu\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nBernie Sanders was also running that year. His campaign centered around income inequality. While he had shown concern for global warming and supported the Paris Accords and reduction in the use of fossil fuels, there was no proposal on the scale of Stein's. /15\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nThe first time it showed up as an actual proposal in Washington D.C. was when Best Supporting Actress Alexandria Ocasio Cortez hamfistedly shoved it in our faces. Now I challenge you do you see any daylight between this: /16https://t.co/eSGyUMIE07\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nSidenote, AOC and her Chief of Staff have reportedly been de-listed from the Justice Democrats.\nAnd Jill Stein's rhetoric in 20102 and 2016? Or how about this from the Democratic Socialists of America Ecosocialists working group? /17https://t.co/1B94Gytoet\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nSo, don't you have to ask yourself, how did the central policy platform of a fringe party candidate in 2012 become a mainstream proposal embraced by Democrat candidates in the presidential primary? How did the DEMOCRATS get taken over by Jill Stein? /18\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nHere's what Bernie and some Bernie Bros had to say after the 2016 primary: /19https://t.co/mUhTHdcTvz\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nMobilizing millions of people to implement the most progressive Democratic platform ever. So what did they do? These same Bernie Bros formed a Brand New Congress and the Justice Democrats. Electing AOC and others. /20https://t.co/k51MH19giq\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nAnd we\u2019ve come full circle.\nAnd now the mobilization is centered around the climate cabal as a cover for the upending of our energy economy and private ownership of industry. Do not ever doubt, this is about money and power. All you have to do is look at the financial gymnastics performed /21\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nby AOC and her campaign manager as well as the other Bernie bros. /22https://t.co/DPFSLI4bTbhttps://t.co/B1YBP7ckky\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nThe real goal is and always has been to make everyone else's life equally shitty, while garbage people like Chakrabarti enrich themselves. THEY MONETIZED ELECTIONS TO THE TUNE OF MILLIONS WHILE THEY WANT YOU TO PAY HIGHER TAXES AND GIVE UP HAMBURGERS. /23\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nThey may take our planes but they will never take OUR HAMBURGERS!\nHow about no. And how about we endlessly hammer the fact that their central policy priorities were endorsed by socialists in New York and originally proposed nationally by a Kremlin loving, Putin defending Green candidate, Jill Stein? /2\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nWe can do that.\nTHIS is what the Democrats have become. The DSA vision of transforming one of the major parties is nearly complete. This is because Democrats embraced their radicals rather than drawing a line at basic American ideals. Free markets, individual freedom & the Constitution. /end\n\u2014 Stacey (@ScotsFyre) March 19, 2019\nAnd all Democrats have ever cared about is power.\n\u2018Nuff said.\nRelated:\n\u2018CONGRATS! You\u2019ve played yourself\u2019! AOC going THERE to prattle on about racial injustice doesn\u2019t end WELL for her",

People want to work for what they get. So, I think that this idea of a guaranteed minimum is not something most people want. They want the ability to be able to secure a job. They want the ability to live in a country where\u2019s there\u2019s the potential for upward mobility.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s response merited plenty of pushback from people appalled that she of all people would have the temerity to suggest that people want to work for their money. And admittedly, she\u2019s maaaaybe not the best messenger for that kind of message. But what, exactly, is so objectionable about pointing out that money means more to people when it\u2019s earned?\nNo I did not. I support a minimum wage. I do not however believe in a minimum guarantee for people \u201cunwilling to work\u201d which was the question asked of me. https://t.co/NTzw8Bimaj\n\u2014 Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 26, 2019\nRegardless of how you feel about Ivanka, at the very least, you should still be able to admit that the Green New Deal\u2019s promise of jobs for those \u201cunwilling to work\u201d was monumentally stupid. But some people just can\u2019t quite bring themselves to admit that.\n\"Ivanka says she opposes @AOC's #GreenNewDeal because she feels people prefer to earn money\u2026One has to wonder if she\u2019s doing this on purpose, or if she\u2019s really so far up her own ass that she\u2019s tasting her Skinny Vanilla Lattes twice\" \u2014 @morninggloria https://t.co/0a3SyIYUZV\n\u2014 The Daily Beast (@thedailybeast) February 26, 2019\nApparently her answers aren\u2019t worth much if they aren\u2019t in unabashed praise of AOC.

Workers are often paid far less than the value they create. https://t.co/P5FsQuhCTW\n\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 26, 2019\nBeg your pardon?\n\"A living wage isn\u2019t a gift, it\u2019s a right.\"\nWhat if I told you it's neither of those things?\nJust blew your mind, didn't I?\n<boom> https://t.co/xq2k6dauL8\n\u2014 Drew McCoy (@_Drew_McCoy_) February 26, 2019\nAOC has a mind?

Kirsten Gillibrand was slamming Donald Trump for his \u201cdangerous rhetoric\u201d in the wake of his tweet regarding Ilhan Omar\u2019s 9/11 remarks. Actually, it was four days ago:\nAs a Senator who represents 9/11 victims, I can't accept any minimizing of that pain. But Trump's dangerous rhetoric against @IlhanMN is disgusting. It\u2019s a false choice to suggest we can\u2019t fight terrorism and reject Islamophobic hate at once\u2014a president should do both.\n\u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) April 13, 2019\nWell anyway, the woman who\u2019s hoping to replace Donald Trump in the White House seems to have undergone a change of heart with regard to \u201cdangerous rhetoric.\u201d At least when she\u2019s the person who\u2019s spouting it:\n.@JoanWalsh profiles @SenGillibrand on the campaign trail: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna punch Trump in the face!\u201d https://t.co/agWtNLaWbe\n\u2014 The Nation (@thenation) April 17, 2019\nJoan Walsh writes in the Nation:\nThe morning after her packed event in Davenport, I follow Gillibrand south to Muscatine\u2014she is on a Mississippi River tour, visiting some of the Iowa counties that flipped from Obama to Trump in 2016\u2014and she seeks me out to make sure I\u2019ll be at her official campaign kickoff that coming Sunday, outside of the Trump International Hotel & Tower in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna punch Trump in the face!\u201d she tells me, smiling broadly, literally jumping up and down. \u201cIt\u2019s the New York way!\u201d Then she hops in her car to race to her next event.\nShould \u201ca president\u201d be talking like that, Kirsten?\nYou\u2019re not inciting violence, are you? \ud83e\udd14\n\u2014 Jen Edwards (@Jennife25485619) April 17, 2019\nShe's going to get someone killed with that rhetoric lol\n\u2014 Steven (@brother_steve) April 17, 2019\nThis feels like incitement\nIs that incitement? Certainly seems like incitement.\n\u2014 Annais Bond (@AnnaisBond) April 17, 2019\nIncitement.\n\u2014 vizz504 (@vizz504) April 17, 2019\n\u2014 Pradheep J.

(@Sanity_Only) April 17, 2019\nWhy is @SenGillibrand inciting violence? So reckless\u2026.\n\u2014 varyar (@varyarpol) April 17, 2019\nGillibrand must be held accountable for inciting violence.\nOMG!! Did she just put the POTUS's life in danger? Incitement!\nPerhaps Ilhan Omar\u2019s army of defenders can spare a few men to sic on Kirsten Gillibrand for this incendiary language. How can Joan Walsh stand for something like this?!\nSo incitement is only bad for the other guy\u2026. https://t.co/EWqL6R5C2c\n\u2014 Educat\u00ebdHillbilly\u2122 (@RobProvince) April 17, 2019\nSo it\u2019s ok if @SenGillibrand incites violence?!?\nOh, haven\u2019t you heard? It\u2019s totally fine when liberals do it.\nSo inciting violence against someone is ok if you\u2019re on the left like Joan & the senator.\n\u2014 Lizzy Lou Who\ud83c\udf37 (@_wintergirl93) April 17, 2019",

I know he didn't go far, but the guy was a governor and congressman. https://t.co/aWZPLvj3jL\n\u2014 Aaron Blake (@AaronBlake) April 17, 2019\nYeah, but was he \u201cserious,\u201d you guys?\nI\u2019m really digging the \u201cserious\u201d qualifier here.\nYeah, this is a pretty suspect use of \"serious candidate\" to wishcast Harris' candidacy as groundbreaking in a way that it isn't https://t.co/YrjbyZWA0q\n\u2014 Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) April 17, 2019\nTo be fair, the piece does mention Bobby Jindal once \u2014 to reiterate that his presidential run wasn\u2019t serious, unlike Kamala\u2019s:\nWill the rest of the Indian-American community coalesce around her, too? Harris, whose late mother was born in India, is the first Indian-American candidate to make a serious run at the presidency. (Bobby Jindal, the former Louisiana governor, never cracked the upper tiers of a massive Republican field in 2016.)\nIf only he\u2019d been as stunning and brave as Kamala Harris, he could\u2019ve made it as far as she has \u2026 which isn\u2019t actually any further than he made it. So, why is Harris a serious candidate while Jindal wasn\u2019t? Is it really that difficult for Politico to just acknowledge that Bobby Jindal beat Kamala Harris to the punch? Not to mention that he didn\u2019t enter the presidential race with all the baggage Kamala\u2019s got?\nI\u2019d like to introduce you to @BobbyJindal. pic.twitter.com/uXjpAKOZ7C\nBobby Jindal? \u2018Memer him?\n\u2014 MrScience_ (@mrscience_) April 17, 2019\nHow did you just erase Bobby Jindal?? He made it further than she is right now?\nJust because Bobby Jindal is a Republican and wasn't ever the front-runner doesn't mean he didn't seriously run for president.\n\u2014 Just Some Guy (@jeremylatzke) April 17, 2019\nSo we just pretend Bobby Jindal doesn't exist?\n\u2014 Jeffrey Collins (@Collinstaxacct) April 17, 2019\nIt's like Bobby Jindal didn't exist.\n\u2014 Dodd, Not Eric Swalwell (@Amuk3) April 17, 2019\nPolitico erasing Bobby jindal from history\n\u2014 ob1156 (@ob1156) April 17, 2019\n\u201cWhy must you hurt me like that?\u201d pic.twitter.com/yEAdfPmRke\n\u2014 Ryan Prong \u0646 (@RyanProng) April 17, 2019\nCan\u2019t wait to hear what they say about Nikki Haley if she ever runs.",
