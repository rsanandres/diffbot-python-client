Christopher Paul Hasson, a self-proclaimed white nationalist, was arrested and accused of plotting a domestic terror attack to kill a bevy of Democratic officials and media figures whom Trump has publicly sparred with.</p>\n<p>Agents found a large arsenal of weapons at Hasson's residence, including 15 firearms and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/400108811/Hasson-motion-for-Detention\">court filing</a> seeking to detain Hasson until trial, the Department of Justice says Hasson &quot;compiled a list of prominent Democratic congressional leaders, activists, political organizations, and MSNBC and CNN media personalities&quot; that he sought to kill.<br>\n The list includes, according to the court filing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;JOEY&rdquo; (who most likely is Joe Scarborough of MSNBC, based on the searches described above); &ldquo;Chris hayes&rdquo; (who presumably is Chris Hayes from MSNBC); &ldquo;Sen blumen jew&rdquo; (who presumably is U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT)); &ldquo;pelosi&rdquo; (who presumably is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)); &ldquo;sen kaine&rdquo; (who presumably is U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA)); &ldquo;ari melber&rdquo; (who presumably is Ari Melber from MSNBC); &ldquo;shumer&rdquo; (who presumably is U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY)); &ldquo;don lemon&rdquo; (who presumably is Don Lemon from CNN); &ldquo;gillibran&rdquo; (who presumably is U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY)); &ldquo;poca warren&rdquo; (who presumably is U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)); &ldquo;cortez&rdquo; (who presumably is U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY)); &ldquo;booker&rdquo; (who presumably is U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ)); &ldquo;harris&rdquo; (who presumably is U.S. Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA)); &ldquo;beto orourke&rdquo; (who presumably is former U.S. Representative Beto O&rsquo;Rourke (D-TX)); &ldquo;maxine waters&rdquo; (who presumably is U.S. Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA); &ldquo;sheila jackson&rdquo; (who presumably is U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson (D-TX)); &ldquo;iihanomar&rdquo; (who presumably is U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN)); &ldquo;chris cuomo&rdquo; (who presumably is Chris Cuomo from CNN); &ldquo;DSA&rdquo; (which presumably is the political organization Democratic Socialists of America); &ldquo;van jones&rdquo; (who presumably is Van Jones from CNN); and &ldquo;podesta&rdquo; (who presumably is former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Most, if not all, of these targets have been favorite punching bags of Trump's, whom Trump has chosen to insult or smear while onstage at his rallies or on Twitter.</p>\n<p>The &quot;poca warren&quot; mention, for instance, is hard to read as anything but a reference to Trump's favorite mocking nickname for Elizabeth Warren, &quot;<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-pocahontas-taunt-warren/story?id=58530657\">Pocahontas</a>.&quot;</p>\n<p>The court filing also says that Hasson searched online for topics that right-wing media has spread fear about, including the searches, &quot;what if Trump illegally impeached&quot; and &quot;civil war if Trump impeached.&quot;</p>\n<p>This is not the first time a domestic terrorist has created a target list of Trump's enemies.</p>\n<p>Right before the midterm elections last fall, a laundry list of Trump's enemies were the <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/trumps-top-targets-receive-bombs-and-suddenly-he-wont-say-their-names/\">target of mail bombs</a> sent by a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/15/pipe-bomb-suspect-cesar-sayoc-pleads-not-guilty-criminal-indictment/2014034002/\">Trump superfan</a>.</p>\n<p>The suspect, Cesar Sayoc, drove a van emblazoned with Trump photos and quotes, and attended Trump rallies.</p>\n<p>Trump has repeatedly been <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/new-york-times-publisher-trump-encouraging-threats-violence-journalists/?fbclid=IwAR0Ffji6_Wuh-zwLNrkoWSL9c6QosIQGigOkto9ZEZO8sS7dVdvrYUdGx8w\">warned</a> that his rhetoric is inspiring violent acts against public officials and the media &mdash; yet he has not stopped his attacks.</p>\n<p>And it doesn't seem likely this arrest will change much.</p>\n<p><em>Published with permission of The American Independent Foundation. </em></p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=shareblue&t_i=211104%20https%3A%2F%2Fshareblue.com%2F%3Fp%3D211104&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Famericanindependent.com%2Fpolice-arrest-white-supremacist-planned-murder-trumps-enemies%2F&t_e=Police%20arrest%20white%20supremacist%20who%20planned%20to%20murder%20Trump's%20enemies&t_d=Police%20arrest%20white%20supremacist%20who%20planned%20to%20murder%20Trump's%20enemies&t_t=Police%20arrest%20white%20supremacist%20who%20planned%20to%20murder%20Trump's%20enemies&s_o=default#version=c9a88830014e14db1a266eb16c7bc97b\"></iframe></figure>",

Christopher Paul Hasson, a self-proclaimed white nationalist, was arrested and accused of plotting a domestic terror attack to kill a bevy of Democratic officials and media figures whom Trump has publicly sparred with.\nAgents found a large arsenal of weapons at Hasson's residence, including 15 firearms and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition.\nIn a court filing seeking to detain Hasson until trial, the Department of Justice says Hasson \"compiled a list of prominent Democratic congressional leaders, activists, political organizations, and MSNBC and CNN media personalities\" that he sought to kill.\nThe list includes, according to the court filing:\n\u201cJOEY\u201d (who most likely is Joe Scarborough of MSNBC, based on the searches described above); \u201cChris hayes\u201d (who presumably is Chris Hayes from MSNBC); \u201cSen blumen jew\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT)); \u201cpelosi\u201d (who presumably is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)); \u201csen kaine\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA)); \u201cari melber\u201d (who presumably is Ari Melber from MSNBC); \u201cshumer\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY)); \u201cdon lemon\u201d (who presumably is Don Lemon from CNN); \u201cgillibran\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY)); \u201cpoca warren\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)); \u201ccortez\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY)); \u201cbooker\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ)); \u201charris\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA)); \u201cbeto orourke\u201d (who presumably is former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX)); \u201cmaxine waters\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA); \u201csheila jackson\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson (D-TX)); \u201ciihanomar\u201d (who presumably is U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN)); \u201cchris cuomo\u201d (who presumably is Chris Cuomo from CNN); \u201cDSA\u201d (which presumably is the political organization Democratic Socialists of America); \u201cvan jones\u201d (who presumably is Van Jones from CNN); and \u201cpodesta\u201d (who presumably is former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta).\nMost, if not all, of these targets have been favorite punching bags of Trump's, whom Trump has chosen to insult or smear while onstage at his rallies or on Twitter.\nThe \"poca warren\" mention, for instance, is hard to read as anything but a reference to Trump's favorite mocking nickname for Elizabeth Warren, \"Pocahontas.\"\nThe court filing also says that Hasson searched online for topics that right-wing media has spread fear about, including the searches, \"what if Trump illegally impeached\" and \"civil war if Trump impeached.\"\nThis is not the first time a domestic terrorist has created a target list of Trump's enemies.\nRight before the midterm elections last fall, a laundry list of Trump's enemies were the target of mail bombs sent by a Trump superfan.\nThe suspect, Cesar Sayoc, drove a van emblazoned with Trump photos and quotes, and attended Trump rallies.\nTrump has repeatedly been warned that his rhetoric is inspiring violent acts against public officials and the media \u2014 yet he has not stopped his attacks.\nAnd it doesn't seem likely this arrest will change much.\nPublished with permission of The American Independent Foundation.",

They promote discrimination rather than justice and demean the worth of LGBTQ people in our state. We call on people of good will to join us in speaking out for basic fairness,&quot; reads <a href=\"https://www.tnep.org/tennessee_clergy_opposed_to_the_2019_slate_of_hate\">the letter</a>.</p>\n<p>The legislation, sponsored by Republicans in the state legislature, would allow adoption agencies to deny services to same-sex couples, give companies the ability to discriminate in their health policies, give state support to schools who oppose gender-neutral bathrooms, and make it state policy to oppose same-sex marriage.</p>\n<p>Rev. Paul Purdue of Belmont United Methodist Church in Nashville, Tennessee, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/03/19/anti-lgbt-legislation-tennessee-clergy/3210472002/\">told the Tennessean</a> that he opposes the legislation and added his name to the letter because Jesus called on Christians to defend those at the margins of society.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's important to stand up and to call people to pay attention and to say that God loves everyone,&quot; he explained.</p>\n<p>The religious opposition to the discriminatory bills are notable, especially since Tennessee is historically a Republican stronghold.</p>\n<p>Republicans <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/tennessee/\">won</a> statewide elections there in 2018, even as Democrats did much better across the rest of the country. In 2016, Trump won the presidential race there easily, with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/tennessee\">60.7 percent</a> of the vote.</p>\n<p>But these religious leaders aren't letting politics act as their guidepost. They are making a moral case and stand, aligning themselves with liberty and freedom while the Republicans attempt to legislate in favor of hate.</p>\n<p>In the deepest of so-called &quot;Red America,&quot; members of the clergy are standing side-by-side to fight for what is right.</p>\n<p><em>Published with permission of The American Independent Foundation.</em></p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=shareblue&t_i=213087%20https%3A%2F%2Fshareblue.com%2F%3Fp%3D213087&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Famericanindependent.com%2Fred-state-religious-leaders-methodist-church-gop-lgbt-attack%2F&t_e=Religious%20leaders%20slam%20GOP's%20hateful%20attack%20on%20Tennessee%20families&t_d=Religious%20leaders%20slam%20GOP's%20hateful%20attack%20on%20Tennessee%20families&t_t=Religious%20leaders%20slam%20GOP's%20hateful%20attack%20on%20Tennessee%20families&s_o=default#version=96f5ca00a04502984667ea244c3ff477\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "Religious leaders in Tennessee, known as one of the most traditionally conservative states in America, are standing up to a multi-bill Republican assault on equal rights for LGBTQ people.\nOver 100 members of the clergy have signed on to a statement from the Tennessee Equality Project in opposition to the Republican bills, described by them as the \"2019 Slate of Hate.\"\n\"We oppose these bills in the Tennessee General Assembly. They promote discrimination rather than justice and demean the worth of LGBTQ people in our state. We call on people of good will to join us in speaking out for basic fairness,\" reads the letter.\nThe legislation, sponsored by Republicans in the state legislature, would allow adoption agencies to deny services to same-sex couples, give companies the ability to discriminate in their health policies, give state support to schools who oppose gender-neutral bathrooms, and make it state policy to oppose same-sex marriage.\nRev. Paul Purdue of Belmont United Methodist Church in Nashville, Tennessee, told the Tennessean that he opposes the legislation and added his name to the letter because Jesus called on Christians to defend those at the margins of society.\n\"It's important to stand up and to call people to pay attention and to say that God loves everyone,\" he explained.\nThe religious opposition to the discriminatory bills are notable, especially since Tennessee is historically a Republican stronghold.\nRepublicans won statewide elections there in 2018, even as Democrats did much better across the rest of the country. In 2016, Trump won the presidential race there easily, with 60.7 percent of the vote.\nBut these religious leaders aren't letting politics act as their guidepost. They are making a moral case and stand, aligning themselves with liberty and freedom while the Republicans attempt to legislate in favor of hate.\nIn the deepest of so-called \"Red America,\" members of the clergy are standing side-by-side to fight for what is right.\nPublished with permission of The American Independent Foundation.",

Ron Johnson (R-WI) plans to introduce legislation that would let the Trump administration detain children for up to 90 days, far more than the current limit of 20 days, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-chairman-to-propose-tighter-asylum-standards-amid-border-surge/2019/04/17/2af3aa1e-6122-11e9-87b8-3f2ec40cd81c_story.html?utm_term=.4473f10f8a9e\">reports</a>.</p>\n<p>Johnson wants to amend the 1997 <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/10/politics/flores-settlement-history/index.html\">Flores settlement</a>, which allows children to remain in immigration detention for no more than 20 days.</p>\n<p>Johnson told the Washington Post that allowing the Trump administration to detain kids for longer would make it easier for families with children to be deported, as they would be in U.S. custody rather than released on their own recognizance.</p>\n<p>Allowing the Trump administration to keep kids in detention facilities is as cruel as it gets, but Johnson tried hard to make himself sound reasonable.</p>\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m happy to compromise at 60,&quot; Johnson told the Washington Post, referencing the number of days he thinks is reasonable to lock up babies and young children.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons Johnson is OK with jailing kids for longer, apparently, is that he thinks the <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/trump-officials-family-separation-kept-860-kids-in-cages-no-beds/\">cages</a> immigrants are kept in aren't as bad as people have made them out to be.</p>\n<p>&quot;It doesn&rsquo;t look that these people have been abused, or spent three nights in a tractor-trailer,&quot; Johnson told the Washington Post.</p>\n<p>Johnson's remarks are especially callous given that multiple immigrant children have <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/border-death-us-custody-kirstjen-nielsen-blames-family/\">died</a> in U.S. custody in recent months.</p>\n<p>And when a group of Democratic lawmakers recently visited a tent city where migrants were being held, they witnessed <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/nanette-barragan-tent-city-el-paso/\">shockingly unhealthy</a> conditions.</p>\n<p>&quot;We were stepping over people to walk around in the tent,&quot; Rep. Nanette Barrag&aacute;n (D-CA) <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/border-patrol-holds-migrants-in-el-paso-tent-city-away-from-prying-eyes\">told</a> the Daily Beast. &quot;I was really taken aback by the smell. I was in there for five minutes and I just became nauseous, I hate to say it.&quot;</p>\n<p>Sickest of all, the Washington Post reported that Johnson is tentatively naming the bill that would allow the government to jail kids the &quot;Families Act.&quot;</p>\n<p>You just can't make this stuff up.</p>\n<p><em>Published with permission of The American Independent Foundation. </em></p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=shareblue&t_i=215129%20https%3A%2F%2Fshareblue.com%2F%3Fp%3D215129&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Famericanindependent.com%2Fron-johnson-flores-settlement-jail-immigrant-babies-kids-longer%2F&t_e=GOP%20senator%20wants%20to%20change%20the%20law%20to%20jail%20immigrant%20kids%20even%20longer&t_d=GOP%20senator%20wants%20to%20change%20the%20law%20to%20jail%20immigrant%20kids%20even%20longer&t_t=GOP%20senator%20wants%20to%20change%20the%20law%20to%20jail%20immigrant%20kids%20even%20longer&s_o=default#version=c9a88830014e14db1a266eb16c7bc97b\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "Despite global condemnation for his cruel family separation policy, Trump still thinks his administration isn't being cruel enough to immigrants and asylum seekers \u2014 and one Republican senator is ready to help Trump reach his especially cruel goal of jailing immigrant children for longer than the law currently allows.\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) plans to introduce legislation that would let the Trump administration detain children for up to 90 days, far more than the current limit of 20 days, the Washington Post reports.\nJohnson wants to amend the 1997 Flores settlement, which allows children to remain in immigration detention for no more than 20 days.\nJohnson told the Washington Post that allowing the Trump administration to detain kids for longer would make it easier for families with children to be deported, as they would be in U.S. custody rather than released on their own recognizance.\nAllowing the Trump administration to keep kids in detention facilities is as cruel as it gets, but Johnson tried hard to make himself sound reasonable.\n\"I\u2019m happy to compromise at 60,\" Johnson told the Washington Post, referencing the number of days he thinks is reasonable to lock up babies and young children.\nOne of the reasons Johnson is OK with jailing kids for longer, apparently, is that he thinks the cages immigrants are kept in aren't as bad as people have made them out to be.\n\"It doesn\u2019t look that these people have been abused, or spent three nights in a tractor-trailer,\" Johnson told the Washington Post.\nJohnson's remarks are especially callous given that multiple immigrant children have died in U.S. custody in recent months.\nAnd when a group of Democratic lawmakers recently visited a tent city where migrants were being held, they witnessed shockingly unhealthy conditions.\n\"We were stepping over people to walk around in the tent,\" Rep. Nanette Barrag\u00e1n (D-CA) told the Daily Beast. \"I was really taken aback by the smell. I was in there for five minutes and I just became nauseous, I hate to say it.\"\nSickest of all, the Washington Post reported that Johnson is tentatively naming the bill that would allow the government to jail kids the \"Families Act.\"\nYou just can't make this stuff up.\nPublished with permission of The American Independent Foundation.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).</p>\n<p>Host James Corden asked him, &quot;Has any politician tried to get your support? Have they courted you?&quot;</p>\n<p>During Trump's inauguration &quot;they offered me a half a million dollars to do it,&quot; 50 Cent replied.</p>\n<p>&quot;To play at the inauguration?&quot; Corden asked.</p>\n<p>&quot;No, just to come,&quot; 50 Cent replied.</p>\n<p>He then explained, &quot;I didn't do it because I didn't know if I could fix the damage, to be honest with you. All money is not good money. You've got to be careful with what you're doing publicly, because &mdash; I don't know how you fix that. I was like, whoa.

It is unclear if the attempted 50 Cent payoff is part of the investigation.</p>\n<p>Trump has been obsessed for a long time over the <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/trump-wasted-tax-dollars-to-prove-once-and-for-all-obamas-inauguration-crowd-was-bigger/\">poor showing</a> at his inauguration, which came soon after he lost to Hillary Clinton in the popular vote by nearly 3 million.</p>\n<p>Photographs of the event showed that it clearly underperformed the previous two inaugurations of President Barack Obama, and perhaps even that of President George W. Bush.</p>\n<p>Contributing to the poor attendance was Trump's <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/trumps-visit-to-a-black-history-museum-cannot-reset-his-racism/\">long history</a> of racism and bigotry. In the presidency he has made matters worse by using <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/trump-native-americans-wounded-knee-pocahontas-racist/\">racial slurs</a>, denigrating <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/he-disgraced-the-country-gop-anchor-blasts-trumps-racist-immigration-rant/\">majority-black</a> countries, and by praising Nazis as <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/trump-charlottesville-anniversary-white-supremacists-racism-hate-groups-grow/\">&quot;very fine people.&quot;</a></p>\n<p>50 Cent was right: Even a $500,000 payout couldn't erase distrust of Trump's racism.

                "text": "According to rapper and actor 50 Cent (real name: Curtis Jackson), Trump offered him $500,000 to appear at his poorly attended inauguration. 50 Cent turned him down because \"all money is not good money.\"\n50 Cent told the story during an appearance Tuesday on CBS' \"The Late Late Show,\" sitting next to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).\nHost James Corden asked him, \"Has any politician tried to get your support? Have they courted you?\"\nDuring Trump's inauguration \"they offered me a half a million dollars to do it,\" 50 Cent replied.\n\"To play at the inauguration?\" Corden asked.\n\"No, just to come,\" 50 Cent replied.\nHe then explained, \"I didn't do it because I didn't know if I could fix the damage, to be honest with you. All money is not good money. You've got to be careful with what you're doing publicly, because \u2014 I don't know how you fix that. I was like, whoa. Don't bring me to fix the African-American problem.\"\nThe audience loudly laughed at the reference to Trump's infamously ham-fisted approach to race relations.\nTrump's inauguration is currently under criminal investigation by the Department of Justice, who is investigating the possible misuse of the $107 million it raised. It is unclear if the attempted 50 Cent payoff is part of the investigation.\nTrump has been obsessed for a long time over the poor showing at his inauguration, which came soon after he lost to Hillary Clinton in the popular vote by nearly 3 million.\nPhotographs of the event showed that it clearly underperformed the previous two inaugurations of President Barack Obama, and perhaps even that of President George W. Bush.\nContributing to the poor attendance was Trump's long history of racism and bigotry. In the presidency he has made matters worse by using racial slurs, denigrating majority-black countries, and by praising Nazis as \"very fine people.\"\n50 Cent was right: Even a $500,000 payout couldn't erase distrust of Trump's racism. And things have gotten far worse since.\nPublished with permission of The American Independent Foundation.",

                "text": "Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 3 million votes. But on Presidents Day, he finally won something fair and square: the title of worst president ever.\nAccording to the \"Presidential Greatness Survey\" published Monday by the American Political Science Association, Trump is ranked 44th out of 44 presidents. The survey counts President Grover Cleveland's non-consecutive administrations as a single presidency, thus sparing Trump from being ranked one spot lower.\nThe survey also ranked President Obama 8th overall, making him the the greatest living president, one spot ahead of Ronald Reagan.\nBut even among Republican respondents to the survey, Trump could only manage a ranking of 40th out of 44, edging out James Buchanan, Franklin Pierce, William Henry Harrison \u2014 who died in office just one month into his first term \u2014 and Andrew Johnson.\nBy contrast, President Obama's first appearance in this survey in 2014 placed him at 18th, and a group of 238 presidential historians ranked Obama 15th after his first year in office.\nTrump's first year in office has been marked by historically low approval numbers, an embarrassing trend that was continued by a five-point drop in his weekly approval rating from Gallup.\nIf there is any consolation for Trump, it's that he can't possibly drop any lower in this ranking during whatever time he has left in office.\nFor the rest of the nation, it's the prospect that that time will be brief.",

The lie is the latest humiliation for Trump, who has been repeatedly denied the ability to waste billions in tax dollars on the racist vanity project.\nTrump posted video of the fence repair with the caption, \"We have just built this powerful Wall in New Mexico. Completed on January 30, 2019 \u2013 47 days ahead of schedule! Many miles more now under construction!\"\nIn a subsequent, lying, all-caps tweet he added, \"THE WALL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW!\"\nThe video is footage of a repair procedure from Sept. 18, 2018. And it isn't \"the wall.\"\n\"It's a replacement project,\" Mike Petersen, a public affairs director for the Army Corps of Engineers, told Task & Purpose.\nThe footage is from the Santa Theresa Project Border Wall Replacement Project, which is an effort to upgrade an existing 20-mile stretch of pre-existing vehicle barriers.\nNot a single solitary mile of new border wall has been built since Trump took office. That's a fact that continues to frustrate him and a prime example of his political impotence.\nHis attempt to get American taxpayers to pony up billions for the wall, after he promised for years that Mexico would \"pay for it,\" led to him shutting down the government.\nAmericans revolted at the unnecessary event and the hardship it created for thousands of federal workers.\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi forced Trump to reopen the government and he eventually had to sign legislation that funded the government and avoided a shutdown without wasting money on the wall.\nTrump has now been reduced to declaring a phony \"national emergency\" to waste existing government funds on the wall, a tactic that prompted immediate legal challenges from multiple states.\nBased on tweets like the fraudulent one touting wall construction and signs at his unhinged rallies that now proclaim \"finish the wall,\" the Trump tactic now appears to be a concerted attempt to claim the wall is in progress.\nLike nearly everything else Trump has said and done, it is a lie.\nThere's no wall being built, no wall to be finished, and no wall \"under construction.\"\nThe only \"wall\" being built is the wall of lies and deception surrounding Trump's presidency.\nPublished with permission of The American Independent Foundation.",

Rather than answer the question, Trump lashed out at Acosta's employer, CNN.</p>\n<p>&quot;You're CNN, you&rsquo;re fake news,&quot; Trump said. &quot;You have an agenda. The numbers that you gave are wrong.&quot;</p>\n<p>But while Trump later claimed that he gets his statistics from the Department of Homeland Security, Acosta was <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2018/06/25/there-is-no-crisis-at-the-border-and-dhs-stats-prove-it/#15001159112a\">correct</a> about what DHS numbers say about border crossings &mdash; which means Trump was smearing his own administration's crime statistics as &quot;fake news.&quot;</p>\n<p>Brian Karem, White House correspondent for Playboy, followed up by asking Trump to &quot;clarify where you get your numbers&quot; on this subject.</p>\n<p>&quot;Most of the DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency] crime reporting statistics we see show that drugs are coming across at the points of entry, that illegal immigration is down, and the violence is down,&quot; Karem pointed out. &quot;So what do you base your facts on?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After a tense back-and-forth in which Trump yelled at Karem to &quot;sit down,&quot; he finally replied, &quot;I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;So your own government stats are wrong, are you saying?&quot; Karem asked.</p>\n<p>&quot;I use many stats,&quot; Trump repeated vaguely, &quot;but I also use Homeland Security.&quot;</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/317516314?app_id=122963\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Since Trump claims to use Homeland Security information, here is what U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, which is part of DHS, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2018/06/25/there-is-no-crisis-at-the-border-and-dhs-stats-prove-it/#15001159112a\">said</a> in December 2017: &quot;In FY17, CBP recorded the lowest level of illegal cross-border migration on record, as measured by apprehensions along the border and inadmissible encounters at U.S. ports of entry.&quot;</p>\n<p>Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2018/06/25/there-is-no-crisis-at-the-border-and-dhs-stats-prove-it/#15001159112a\">noted</a> that Trump officials often cherry-pick data from 2017 and 2018 to claim that illegal border crossings are skyrocketing, but that this just doesn't represent reality.</p>\n<p>This trend of decreasing border crossings also tracks with broader immigration patterns since 1980, Forbes points out: &quot;Border Patrol apprehensions along the Southwest border plummeted by approximately 80%, from a high of over 1.6 million in FY 2000, to around 300,000 in FY 2017. (Apprehensions are considered a proxy for illegal entry, so the fewer apprehensions, the less illegal entry.)&quot;</p>\n<p>As for Trump's desire to link all immigrants to an increase of criminal activity, Acosta was correct: Immigrants &mdash; whether documented or undocumented &mdash; commit crimes at a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/two-charts-demolish-the-notion-that-immigrants-here-illegally-commit-more-crime/?utm_term=.9bfd0a4d2a22\">lower rate</a> than those born in the United States.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798\">Wall Street Journal</a> puts an even finer point on it: While the number of undocumented immigrants tripled between 1990 and 2013, violent crimes in the U.S. declined by 48 percent in the same period.</p>\n<p>As for drugs coming into the country, CPB also does, in fact say most drugs are <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/16/fact-check-mike-pence-donald-trump-drugs-crossing-southern-border-wall/2591279002/\">smuggled</a> through points of entry &mdash; something a wall would do nothing to stop.</p>\n<p>Trump is so <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/trump-pretends-already-has-wall-cave-funding/\">desperate</a> to build a wall that he even refuses to accept official data from his own government.</p>\n<p>And when informed reporters call him out for his willful ignorance, Trump just can't handle it.</p>\n<p><em>Published with permission of The American Independent Foundation. </em></p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=shareblue&t_i=210777%20https%3A%2F%2Fshareblue.com%2F%3Fp%3D210777&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Famericanindependent.com%2Ftrump-throws-fit-national-emergency-reporters-dhs-numbers-prove-him-wrong%2F&t_e=Trump%20throws%20a%20fit%20when%20reporters%20note%20his%20own%20numbers%20prove%20him%20wrong&t_d=Trump%20throws%20a%20fit%20when%20reporters%20note%20his%20own%20numbers%20prove%20him%20wrong&t_t=Trump%20throws%20a%20fit%20when%20reporters%20note%20his%20own%20numbers%20prove%20him%20wrong&s_o=default#version=c9a88830014e14db1a266eb16c7bc97b\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "Trump came completely unglued on Friday when multiple reporters pointed out that his racist rhetoric about immigrants does not match up with federal government data, including from Trump's own Department of Homeland Security.\n\"I use many stats,\" Trump cried petulantly at one point when he was unable to come up with a specific rebuttal to the facts reporters cited.\nThe exchange came during a press conference in which Trump declared a national emergency to help him steal funds to build a wall along the southern border.\nCNN's Jim Acosta asked Trump to explain the discrepancy between his claims that there is a \"national emergency\" at the border, and data from the Department of Homeland Security showing \"border crossings at a near record low.\"\nAcosta also pointed out that undocumented immigrants are \"committing crime at lower levels than native-born Americans.\"\nAfter noting these facts, Acosta asked Trump if he was \"concocting a national emergency here in order to get your wall because you couldn\u2019t get it through other ways?\"\nTrump lost it. Rather than answer the question, Trump lashed out at Acosta's employer, CNN.\n\"You're CNN, you\u2019re fake news,\" Trump said. \"You have an agenda. The numbers that you gave are wrong.\"\nBut while Trump later claimed that he gets his statistics from the Department of Homeland Security, Acosta was correct about what DHS numbers say about border crossings \u2014 which means Trump was smearing his own administration's crime statistics as \"fake news.\"\nBrian Karem, White House correspondent for Playboy, followed up by asking Trump to \"clarify where you get your numbers\" on this subject.\n\"Most of the DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency] crime reporting statistics we see show that drugs are coming across at the points of entry, that illegal immigration is down, and the violence is down,\" Karem pointed out. \"So what do you base your facts on?\u201d\nAfter a tense back-and-forth in which Trump yelled at Karem to \"sit down,\" he finally replied, \"I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily.\"\n\"So your own government stats are wrong, are you saying?\" Karem asked.\n\"I use many stats,\" Trump repeated vaguely, \"but I also use Homeland Security.\"\nSince Trump claims to use Homeland Security information, here is what U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, which is part of DHS, said in December 2017: \"In FY17, CBP recorded the lowest level of illegal cross-border migration on record, as measured by apprehensions along the border and inadmissible encounters at U.S. ports of entry.\"\nForbes noted that Trump officials often cherry-pick data from 2017 and 2018 to claim that illegal border crossings are skyrocketing, but that this just doesn't represent reality.\nThis trend of decreasing border crossings also tracks with broader immigration patterns since 1980, Forbes points out: \"Border Patrol apprehensions along the Southwest border plummeted by approximately 80%, from a high of over 1.6 million in FY 2000, to around 300,000 in FY 2017. (Apprehensions are considered a proxy for illegal entry, so the fewer apprehensions, the less illegal entry.)\"\nAs for Trump's desire to link all immigrants to an increase of criminal activity, Acosta was correct: Immigrants \u2014 whether documented or undocumented \u2014 commit crimes at a lower rate than those born in the United States.\nThe Wall Street Journal puts an even finer point on it: While the number of undocumented immigrants tripled between 1990 and 2013, violent crimes in the U.S. declined by 48 percent in the same period.\nAs for drugs coming into the country, CPB also does, in fact say most drugs are smuggled through points of entry \u2014 something a wall would do nothing to stop.\nTrump is so desperate to build a wall that he even refuses to accept official data from his own government.\nAnd when informed reporters call him out for his willful ignorance, Trump just can't handle it.\nPublished with permission of The American Independent Foundation.",

Cory Gardner</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This week is a district work period for members of Congress &mdash; better known as a recess week, when lawmakers head home to meet with constituents and get a feel for what the voters who sent them to Capitol Hill want to see them work on in the nation's capital.</p>\n<p>Yet three vulnerable Republican senators up for re-election in 2020, who just voted to ignore the Constitution and <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/senate-humiliates-trump-repeal-fake-national-emergency/\">uphold Trump's fake national emergency</a>, have no public events listed for constituents to attend, according to a review of senators' official websites, campaign websites and social media accounts.</p>\n<p>They include Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who at first came out strongly against Trump's national emergency declaration before <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/vulnerable-thom-tillis-ditches-constitution-national-emergency-back-trump/\">fully capitulating to Trump</a> and voting to uphold the emergency in an embarrassing flip-flop for the ages.</p>\n<p>Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO), arguably the most vulnerable Republican incumbent senator facing re-election in 2020, also has no public events listed on his websites nor social media accounts. Gardner was rebuked by his hometown newspaper, which <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/cory-gardner-regret-denver-post-fake-emergency/\">revoked its endorsement</a> of the senator after Gardner's vote to uphold the fake emergency.</p>\n<p>Neither does Sen. Martha McSally (R-AZ), who was appointed to fill the Senate vacancy left after John McCain died last August and who faces voters in an election to serve out the remainder of McCain's term in November 2020. McSally's hometown newspaper <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2019/03/13/martha-mcsallys-support-trumps-emergency-could-sink-her-2020/3154109002/\">said</a> the vote could cost her at the ballot box next year.</p>\n<p>It's possible these senators are holding events when they're back in their home states. However constituents searching for ways to get face time with their elected officials wouldn't find anything listed publicly online, and instead would have to seek out information from the senators' office.</p>\n<p>Hiding from constituents is nothing new. Republicans <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/27/15880904/republicans-town-hall-health-care\">stopped holding regular town halls</a> in 2017, after they faced fury from constituents angry about the GOP plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Two years later, that trend continues.</p>\n<p>It seems Republicans are still scared to face the constituents who have the power to send them to Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p><em>Published with permission of The American Independent Foundation.</em></p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=shareblue&t_i=213095%20https%3A%2F%2Fshareblue.com%2F%3Fp%3D213095&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Famericanindependent.com%2Fvulnerable-senators-hide-from-voters-trump-fake-emergency-constitution%2F&t_e=GOP%20senators%20dodge%20voters%20after%20backing%20Trump%20over%20the%20Constitution&t_d=GOP%20senators%20dodge%20voters%20after%20backing%20Trump%20over%20the%20Constitution&t_t=GOP%20senators%20dodge%20voters%20after%20backing%20Trump%20over%20the%20Constitution&s_o=default#version=c9a88830014e14db1a266eb16c7bc97b\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "This week is a district work period for members of Congress \u2014 better known as a recess week, when lawmakers head home to meet with constituents and get a feel for what the voters who sent them to Capitol Hill want to see them work on in the nation's capital.\nYet three vulnerable Republican senators up for re-election in 2020, who just voted to ignore the Constitution and uphold Trump's fake national emergency, have no public events listed for constituents to attend, according to a review of senators' official websites, campaign websites and social media accounts.\nThey include Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who at first came out strongly against Trump's national emergency declaration before fully capitulating to Trump and voting to uphold the emergency in an embarrassing flip-flop for the ages.\nSen. Cory Gardner (R-CO), arguably the most vulnerable Republican incumbent senator facing re-election in 2020, also has no public events listed on his websites nor social media accounts. Gardner was rebuked by his hometown newspaper, which revoked its endorsement of the senator after Gardner's vote to uphold the fake emergency.\nNeither does Sen. Martha McSally (R-AZ), who was appointed to fill the Senate vacancy left after John McCain died last August and who faces voters in an election to serve out the remainder of McCain's term in November 2020. McSally's hometown newspaper said the vote could cost her at the ballot box next year.\nIt's possible these senators are holding events when they're back in their home states. However constituents searching for ways to get face time with their elected officials wouldn't find anything listed publicly online, and instead would have to seek out information from the senators' office.\nHiding from constituents is nothing new. Republicans stopped holding regular town halls in 2017, after they faced fury from constituents angry about the GOP plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nTwo years later, that trend continues.\nIt seems Republicans are still scared to face the constituents who have the power to send them to Washington, D.C.\nPublished with permission of The American Independent Foundation.",

Within 24 hours of his official kickoff, the Vermont senator had raised a <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/bernie-sanders-24-hour-record-2020.html\">staggering $6 million</a>, <em>quadruple</em> the previous known first-day record, and within a week, his campaign had signed up more than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1100023111544721408\">1 million volunteers</a>. All that excitement is already showing up in the polls, where Sanders had been running <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\">second</a> in a still-hypothetical field for most of the past year. According to <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020-democratic-primary/\">Morning Consult</a>, which is surveying primary voters daily, Sanders picked up 6 percentage points in the past week and, as of Tuesday, clocked in at 27 percent support nationally, moving him into a statistical dead heat for first place with Joe Biden, who remains on the sidelines. Bernie&rsquo;s closest <em>declared</em> rival, meanwhile, is Kamala Harris, who sits in a distant third place with 10 percent support.</p>\n<p>Sanders&rsquo; impressive start would not have been possible without the foundation he laid during his insurgent challenge to Hillary Clinton in 2016. It was then that the self-styled democratic socialist amassed the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/2020-democrats-campaign-funding.html\">network of supporters</a> that begat last week&rsquo;s initial burst of donations and volunteers. And it was then that he transformed himself from a Phish Food&ndash;flavored fringe character into a national politician with near-universal name recognition.</p>\n<p>But unfortunately for Sanders, he&rsquo;s carrying over something else from his remarkable 2016 campaign: baggage.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, Sanders felt compelled to make a <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-email-surrogates-respectfully-engage-bullying_n_5c72188fe4b03cfdaa55e866\">semipublic plea</a> for his allies to be on their best behavior during the Democratic primary, or in his words, to &ldquo;engage respectively with our Democratic opponents&mdash;talking about issues we are fighting for, not about personalities or past grievances.&rdquo; It served as a tacit acknowledgement of something Sanders <a href=\"http://www.ebony.com/news-views/sen-bernie-sanders-interview-jamilah-lemieux\">conceded more openly</a> in the 2016 campaign but that continues to dog him: that some of his most ardent supporters have a nasty streak that Clinton die-hards have not forgotten and the political press corps cannot get enough of. &ldquo;I want to be clear that I condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space,&rdquo; Sanders wrote in his recent email.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not entirely clear that the festering 2016 resentment matters outside the Beltway.</p>\n<p>The lingering bad blood between the Sanders and Clinton camps then spilled more fully into public view Monday by way of a Politico story headlined &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-private-jet-flights-1182793\">Ex-Clinton Staffers Slam Sanders Over Private Jet Flights</a>,&rdquo; in which former Clinton staffers complained that the campaign had to pay to fly Sanders on private jets while he was stumping for Clinton in the general election. Much of the sniping was done under cover of anonymity, but the harshest words were on the record. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop Donald Trump, his Royal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe,&rdquo; said Zac Petkanas, who led Hillary&rsquo;s rapid response team in 2016. Michael Briggs, Sanders&rsquo; 2016 campaign spokesman, fired back, calling Clinton&rsquo;s team &ldquo;total ingrates&rdquo; and &ldquo;some of the biggest assholes in American politics.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The insult-slinging was ostensibly about private jets, but in reality it was a proxy for the larger debate that continues to bubble up inside the Beltway in Year 3 of Donald Trump&rsquo;s presidency&mdash;namely, how much Sanders&rsquo; primary challenge damaged Clinton&rsquo;s candidacy and whether he subsequently did all he could to heal the intraparty wounds before the general election. The fact that Monday&rsquo;s spat was about Sanders&rsquo; mode of travel to Clinton rallies illustrates how unproductive this feud is. It&rsquo;s about whether Sanders <em>did enough</em> to help the first female nominee of a major party in U.S. history&mdash;not whether he helped her at all. Likewise, it calls to mind the running debate over Bernie Bros, who simultaneously <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2016/02/bernie-bros-are-bad-the-conversation-around-them-is-worse.html\">exist and don&rsquo;t exist</a> in the numbers Sanders&rsquo; critics suggest: Did Bernie do enough to rein in the worst impulses of his most combative fans, and is he doing enough now? As narrow as these rifts are, they&rsquo;re unlikely to ever be bridged by the two entrenched sides.</p>\n<p>The good news for Sanders is that it&rsquo;s not entirely clear that the festering 2016 resentment matters outside the Beltway. His favorability rating within the Democratic rank and file suggests the vast majority of primary voters have either forgiven, forgotten, or never noticed the rift in the first place. In the <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020-democratic-primary/\">Morning Consult poll</a>, for example, 75 percent of Democratic voters said they had a favorable opinion of Sanders, while just 15 percent said they had an unfavorable one. Those numbers are nearly as good as Biden&rsquo;s (76 percent to 12 percent) and <em>far</em> better than every other potential rival, none of whom have faced the same kind of he&rsquo;s-not-even-technically-a-Democrat complaints that get lobbed at Sanders from the party faithful.</p>\n<p>If the old Clinton and Sanders camps continue to relitigate those old grievances, however, the squabbles could complicate Sanders&rsquo; attempts to defend himself from the more specific criticisms leveled at his first presidential campaign, which include the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bernie-sanders-apologizes-women-staff-harassed-2016-campaign/story?id=60289798\">alleged mistreatment</a> of female staffers and his lackluster appeals to black voters, particularly in the early nominating contests back when his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/us/politics/bernie-sanders-black-voters-outreach.html\">leadership team was predominantly white</a>. Sanders has taken steps to address both&mdash;he <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bernie-sanders-apologizes-women-staff-harassed-2016-campaign/story?id=60289798\">apologized</a> to his female campaign staffers publicly, and he&rsquo;s now more explicitly drawing a connection between economic inequality and racial inequality than he did in 2016&mdash;but the complaints will almost certainly re-emerge in a primary where gender, race, and identity are dominant themes. Sanders may have to lug his 2016 baggage with him into 2020, especially if a candidate of color and/or a woman emerges as his most direct challenger. The question, though, is whether his campaign will have so much momentum that he won&rsquo;t feel the weight of it.</p>",

                "html": "<p>In 2002, Justice Antonin Scalia <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/01-488P.ZC\">warned</a> that &ldquo;our people&rsquo;s traditional belief in the right of trial by jury is in perilous decline.&rdquo; His successor, Justice Neil Gorsuch, agrees&mdash;and he isn&rsquo;t happy about it. On Tuesday, during <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2018/17-1672_c0n2.pdf\">oral arguments</a> in <em>United States v. Haymond</em>, Gorsuch lambasted Congress&rsquo; efforts to skirt the Constitution by empowering judges to imprison sex offenders without the safeguard of a jury. It was a remarkable defense of the Sixth Amendment that points toward a broad decision restoring the jury trial right to some of the country&rsquo;s most maligned defendants.</p>\n<p><em>Haymond </em>involves a <a href=\"https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/part-ii-criminal-procedure/chapter-227-sentences/subchapter-d-imprisonment/3583-inclusion-of-a-term-of-supervised-release-after-imprisonment\">federal statute</a> that governs sentencing for certain defendants convicted of a sex offense. After completing their prison term, these offenders are placed on supervised release. If offenders violate the terms of their release, a judge can send them back to prison to serve more time for their original conviction. That&rsquo;s standard practice in the federal system. The statute at issue in <em>Haymond</em>, though, is a different beast. Under this law, a judge must sentence offenders to <em>additional </em>prison time&mdash;from five years to life&mdash;if they violate the terms of their release. This new sentence may go beyond what the offender&rsquo;s first conviction allowed. And the judge need only find proof of a violation &ldquo;by a preponderance of the evidence.&rdquo; No jury is involved.</p>\n<p>This scheme is, to put it mildly, quite weird. Generally, under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, the government <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1999/99-478?sort=ideology\">must prove</a> every element of a crime that increases a sentence to a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt. The law in <em>Haymond </em>flips this requirement on its head. It allows a judge to decide the facts herself, under a standard more lenient than the Due Process Clause typically <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1969/778\">requires</a>. And once she has found the offender guilty, she can imprison him for much longer than his original conviction permitted.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Gorsuch sounded downright shocked by this flagrant infringement of the Sixth Amendment. &ldquo;Why is the government so anxious to avoid having the involvement of citizens in this process?&rdquo; he asked Eric Feigin, assistant to the Solicitor General. &ldquo;It would be a rather simple thing to convene a jury, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Historically,&rdquo; Gorsuch continued, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s never been this kind of system before. Congress self-consciously created this system. And I guess &hellip; I&rsquo;m just struggling. I just don&rsquo;t understand why the government resists the involvement of a jury of a man&rsquo;s or woman&rsquo;s peers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gorsuch seemed rankled by the fact that Congress abolished parole for federal defendants, then sought to replace it with a draconian scheme like this one. Instead of parole, sex offenders now receive supervised release&mdash;but if they&rsquo;re accused of a new misdeed, they lose their right to a jury trial. And if they&rsquo;re found guilty (by a judge), they may be locked up <em>for life</em>. &ldquo;We had parole systems previously,&rdquo; Gorsuch said, &ldquo;and Congress chose to abandon that system. And why doesn&rsquo;t that choice have consequences? And why isn&rsquo;t one of those consequences the jury right?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As usual, Justice Sonia Sotomayor was right at Gorsuch side <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/sotomayor-gorsuch-supreme-court-dissent-criminal-restitution.html\">defending the Sixth Amendment</a>. &ldquo;Is there any other area of the law in which we permit imprisonment by a preponderance of the evidence?&rdquo; Sotomayor asked Feigin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to figure out why a judge now gets to &hellip; find by a preponderance of the evidence, after you&rsquo;ve been sentenced to the five years, that we really should have given you eight years.&rdquo; If &ldquo;a jury didn&rsquo;t find facts sufficient to give him the additional years,&rdquo; how can that sentence possibly be constitutional?</p>\n<p>The answer is that it isn&rsquo;t. And on Tuesday, a clear majority of the court <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/02/argument-analysis-court-poised-to-rule-for-challenger-in-dispute-over-constitutionality-of-sex-offender-law/\">seemed prepared</a> to rule as much, either striking down the scheme altogether or compelling the government to prove each new offense to a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt. That would be an important victory for the Sixth Amendment, and an affirmation that the government cannot lock away sex offenders for life without a jury&rsquo;s input. True, it might make prosecutors&rsquo; jobs a bit more difficult. As Scalia <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/99-478P.ZC\">wrote in 2003</a>, however, the jury trial &ldquo;has never been efficient&rdquo;&mdash;but &ldquo;it has always been free.&rdquo;</p>",

Reg. 4949) is hereby terminated.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Were you able to read that entire sentence? Were you able to squeeze the reading of this sentence into your tight schedule, and to divine its meaning&mdash;that it would terminate Trump&rsquo;s recently declared national emergency? Then you, reader, have gotten much farther along in your review process than a number of Senate Republicans.</p>\n<p>After the House passes this resolution Tuesday evening, the Senate will be forced to take a vote on it in the coming weeks. It&rsquo;s a vote that many Republicans <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/trump-border-wall-emergency-terminate-vote.html\">wouldn&rsquo;t like to take:</a> They fear the precedent of allowing the president to use national emergency powers to secure money that Congress wouldn&rsquo;t give him, but they also fear Trump being mad at them. Until they have to take that vote, many Senate Republicans would prefer to hold their votes close to the chest.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not read the resolution yet,&rdquo; Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran said. &ldquo;My staff has given me some background on the constitutional, statutory law. I just have a lot more to know.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen it yet,&rdquo; Florida Sen. Rick Scott said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m frustrated the Democrats didn&rsquo;t fund border security, so I completely understand why the president did what he did.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When I said, to follow up, that it was a one-pager that would terminate the national emergency, his spokesperson interrupted us, asked for my name in a less-than-chummy way, and joined his boss in the elevator.</p>\n<p>Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, the chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee who <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/13/ron-johnson-trump-emergency-shutdown-1098724\">said in January</a> that he would &ldquo;hate to see&rdquo; an emergency declaration, said &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to see what it&rsquo;s going to be like&rdquo; when asked how he would vote on the resolution, adding that there was a lot of &ldquo;ambiguity&rdquo; in the law.</p>\n<p>Utah Sen. Mitt Romney: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Phil_Mattingly/status/1100451799050436608\">Still looking</a> at the text.</p>\n<p>Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, at least, was specific about which aspects of the emergency declaration he still needs to review: The specific accounts within the military construction budget from which the wall money would come.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;[Trump] has a justification where he&rsquo;s said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m declaring this a national emergency,&rsquo; and then we&rsquo;re waiting for the legal justification and the line items,&rdquo; Lankford said. &ldquo;And none of us have seen that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Republican leaders, though, are telling those senators concerned about money for projects in their home states being diverted to &ldquo;the wall&rdquo; not to worry: They&rsquo;ll just &ldquo;backfill&rdquo; the money immediately after.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I predict there&rsquo;ll be no trouble in the appropriations committee to backfill&mdash;make sure there&rsquo;s no cut, ultimate cut&mdash;in military construction,&rdquo; Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, chair of the appropriations committee, said. &ldquo;That issue won&rsquo;t stay alive long.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The issue of where the money is coming from, in any event, is one that should be secondary to how a member votes on the resolution to terminate the emergency declaration. The question at hand is whether a president should be allowed to grab money from elsewhere to fund something that Congress refused to fund. This question isn&rsquo;t particularly &ldquo;ambiguous,&rdquo; and the legislative vehicle for saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a lengthy or tricky text. There is not &ldquo;a lot more to know.&rdquo; What the senators are really trying to backfill is their own justification for ceding the power of the purse to the executive branch.</p>",

It\u2019s a vote that many Republicans wouldn\u2019t like to take: They fear the precedent of allowing the president to use national emergency powers to secure money that Congress wouldn\u2019t give him, but they also fear Trump being mad at them. Until they have to take that vote, many Senate Republicans would prefer to hold their votes close to the chest.\n\u201cI\u2019ve not read the resolution yet,\u201d Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran said. \u201cMy staff has given me some background on the constitutional, statutory law. I just have a lot more to know.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it yet,\u201d Florida Sen. Rick Scott said, \u201cbut I\u2019m frustrated the Democrats didn\u2019t fund border security, so I completely understand why the president did what he did.\u201d\nWhen I said, to follow up, that it was a one-pager that would terminate the national emergency, his spokesperson interrupted us, asked for my name in a less-than-chummy way, and joined his boss in the elevator.\nWisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, the chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee who said in January that he would \u201chate to see\u201d an emergency declaration, said \u201cwe\u2019re going to see what it\u2019s going to be like\u201d when asked how he would vote on the resolution, adding that there was a lot of \u201cambiguity\u201d in the law.\nUtah Sen. Mitt Romney: Still looking at the text.\nOklahoma Sen. James Lankford, at least, was specific about which aspects of the emergency declaration he still needs to review: The specific accounts within the military construction budget from which the wall money would come.\n\u201c[Trump] has a justification where he\u2019s said, \u2018I\u2019m declaring this a national emergency,\u2019 and then we\u2019re waiting for the legal justification and the line items,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cAnd none of us have seen that.\u201d\nRepublican leaders, though, are telling those senators concerned about money for projects in their home states being diverted to \u201cthe wall\u201d not to worry: They\u2019ll just \u201cbackfill\u201d the money immediately after.\n\u201cI predict there\u2019ll be no trouble in the appropriations committee to backfill\u2014make sure there\u2019s no cut, ultimate cut\u2014in military construction,\u201d Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, chair of the appropriations committee, said. \u201cThat issue won\u2019t stay alive long.\u201d\nThe issue of where the money is coming from, in any event, is one that should be secondary to how a member votes on the resolution to terminate the emergency declaration. The question at hand is whether a president should be allowed to grab money from elsewhere to fund something that Congress refused to fund. This question isn\u2019t particularly \u201cambiguous,\u201d and the legislative vehicle for saying \u201cno\u201d isn\u2019t a lengthy or tricky text. There is not \u201ca lot more to know.\u201d What the senators are really trying to backfill is their own justification for ceding the power of the purse to the executive branch.",

                "html": "<p>On Tuesday, House Republicans voted to support President Trump&rsquo;s assertion of unchecked executive power. Trump has invoked a law passed <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/94/hr3884/text\">43 years ago</a>&mdash;which was designed to facilitate presidential action in times of desperate haste, such as war or disaster&mdash;to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-southern-border-united-states/\">seize power from Congress</a> and override its explicit instructions. And Trump&rsquo;s party is standing behind this assault on the Constitution, ensuring that Congress won&rsquo;t be able to block him.</p>\n<p>The GOP&rsquo;s complicity is bitterly ironic because at the same time, Republicans are decrying a presidential coup against the national legislature of Venezuela. Unlike the United States, Venezuela is awash in economic chaos and political repression. But the behavior of Trump and his party since the November midterms bears an uncanny resemblance to the behavior of Venezuelan President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro and his party after they lost that country&rsquo;s 2015 legislative elections. Trump says Venezuela illustrates the perils of socialism. But it also illustrates the perils of authoritarianism, which the Republican Party of the United States now supports.</p>\n<p>In December 2015, Venezuelans expressed their disgust with Maduro by electing the opposition to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/07/world/americas/venezuela-elections.html\">take over the National Assembly</a>. Maduro ignored their rebuke. He declared a national emergency that gave him, according to the New York Times, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/16/world/americas/venezuela-declares-emergency-as-its-economy-falters.html\">the power to bypass the National Assembly on spending matters</a>.&rdquo; In May 2016, Maduro renewed the emergency declaration, falsely claiming that the country faced a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKCN0Y501X\">threat of invasion</a>. He accused the opposition of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/15/americas/venezuela-slide-into-crisis/index.html\">petition fraud</a>, obstructionism, and trying to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics-idUSL2N18B014\">impeach</a> him.</p>\n<p>The assembly voted to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-venezuela-protest-20160518-snap-story.html\">reject</a> the emergency declaration. Lawmakers warned that no Venezuelan president had ever undertaken such emergency measures in defiance of a vote of the legislature. But Maduro&rsquo;s allies on the supreme court <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36339721\">upheld</a> his declaration, and he plowed ahead. In the United States, Republicans mocked Maduro&rsquo;s talk of an invasion and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/house-section/article/H2967-1\">condemned him</a> for overriding the assembly. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called it a coup. &ldquo;Democracy has been canceled,&rdquo; said Rubio. &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3234-3\">You have an elected national assembly being ignored</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The assembly passed laws restricting Maduro&rsquo;s authority. He ignored them, and the court <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2018/wha/281787.htm\">upheld his right to act without legislative approval</a>. In 2017, when he created an alternative legislative body, the Trump administration denounced his &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/08/273543.htm\">power grab</a>&rdquo; and demanded that he &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-treasury-secretary-steven-mnuchin-national-security-advisor-h-r-mcmaster-073117/\">respect Venezuela&rsquo;s constitution</a>.&rdquo; Vice President Mike Pence protested that Maduro had &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-president-macri-argentina-joint-press-conference/\">ignored and undermined the National Assembly</a>.&rdquo; Trump imposed sanctions, claiming that Maduro had &ldquo;usurped the power of the democratically elected National Assembly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In February 2018, Maduro seized more financial power by creating a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/world/americas/venezuela-petro-currency.html\">digital currency</a>. The assembly declared this move <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-07/venezuela-sees-cryptocurrency-rollout-ending-reviled-dolartoday\">unconstitutional</a> and <a href=\"http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/noticias/_an-declaro-nula-la-emision-del-petro-y-todas-sus-obligaciones\">void</a>, but Maduro dismissed its verdict. Trump responded by imposing sanctions on anyone who used the new currency to evade sanctions. In its explanation of the sanctions, the Trump administration protested that Maduro had issued the currency &ldquo;in a process that <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-taking-additional-steps-address-situation-venezuela/\">Venezuela&rsquo;s democratically elected National Assembly has denounced as unlawful</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Last month, Trump went further. He announced that the United States would recognize the assembly&rsquo;s president, Juan Guaid&oacute;, as Venezuela&rsquo;s true president. The assembly was &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-donald-j-trump-recognizing-venezuelan-national-assembly-president-juan-guaido-interim-president-venezuela/\">duly elected by the Venezuelan people</a>,&rdquo; said Trump. On this basis, the United States would honor Guaid&oacute;&rsquo;s declaration that he, not Maduro, was the country&rsquo;s legitimate leader. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pointed out that Guaid&oacute; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2019/01/288560.htm\">made this declaration with the full support of the National Assembly</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Like Maduro, Trump ignored precedents that had previously limited the assertion of emergency powers.</p>\n<p>House Republicans agreed that Maduro trampled the assembly and had to be stopped. Republican Whip Steve Scalise thanked Trump for &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveScalise/status/1097881602888265728\">standing with the Venezuelan people</a>&rdquo; against Maduro. Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said America had to ensure that &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/1095822590843764737\">democracy [is] restored for the people of Venezuela</a>.&rdquo; Rep. Liz Cheney, chair of the House Republican Conference, praised &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1088946180640460806\">US efforts to support freedom for the people of Venezuela</a>.&rdquo; Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a leading GOP voice on foreign policy, <a href=\"https://kinzinger.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=400001\">called on Americans</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepKinzinger/status/1088180128461611011\">stand with Venezuelans</a> against &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepKinzinger/status/901146730204463104\">the tyranny of Maduro</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the Republican position on authoritarianism in Venezuela. But at home, the Republican position is just the opposite. In November, Americans expressed their disgust with Trump&mdash;a president who never even won the popular vote&mdash;by electing the opposition to take over the House of Representatives. The new Congress voted to reject Trump&rsquo;s demand for $5.7 billion to build a border wall. Trump, like Maduro, responded by dismissing the will of the legislature. He <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-southern-border-united-states/\">declared a national emergency</a> and asserted, through his control of the military, the power to spend money that Congress, in its exercise of <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/trump-national-emergency-power-grab.html\">constitutionally assigned power</a>, had refused to appropriate.</p>\n<p>Like Maduro, Trump accused the opposition of voter fraud, obstructionism, and trying to impeach him. Like Maduro, Trump claimed that he had to assume unilateral authority because his country faced a fictional &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-national-security-humanitarian-crisis-southern-border/\">invasion</a>.&rdquo; Like Maduro, Trump ignored precedents that had previously limited the assertion of emergency powers. Like Maduro, he hopes his allies on the Supreme Court will stand by him.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, House Republicans voted 182 to 13 against a resolution to terminate Trump&rsquo;s power grab. They couldn&rsquo;t stop the resolution, because Democrats hold the majority. But the GOP&rsquo;s votes are enough to ensure that when Trump vetoes the resolution, as he <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-vice-premier-liu-peoples-republic-china-2/\">has pledged to do</a>, the House can&rsquo;t override his veto. The Republican Party has decided to stand not for the rule of law, but for the rule of Trump. It is no longer a republican party.</p>\n<p>At a press conference on Tuesday morning, House Republicans <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?458267-1/house-republican-leaders-defend-national-emergency-declaration\">defended Trump&rsquo;s declaration</a> and endorsed his deployment of the U.S. military to the southern border. &ldquo;The president has the authority to do it,&rdquo; said McCarthy. &ldquo;There is an emergency at the border,&rdquo; said Cheney. &ldquo;This is a national emergency,&rdquo; agreed Kinzinger. Scalise claimed that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no physical barrier to control our border&rdquo;&mdash;which is false&mdash;and vowed that Republicans would &ldquo;stand with the president.&rdquo; He insisted, &ldquo;The president is on strong legal ground to declare this emergency.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>We are not Venezuela. We don&rsquo;t have runaway inflation and crime, corrupt state control of the economy, or routine incarceration for political dissent. But we do have the first two ingredients: a president willing to seize power, and a party willing to block the legislature from stopping him. It&rsquo;s not the left that is threatening to turn the United States into Venezuela. It&rsquo;s the right.</p>",

                "text": "On Tuesday, House Republicans voted to support President Trump\u2019s assertion of unchecked executive power. Trump has invoked a law passed 43 years ago\u2014which was designed to facilitate presidential action in times of desperate haste, such as war or disaster\u2014to seize power from Congress and override its explicit instructions. And Trump\u2019s party is standing behind this assault on the Constitution, ensuring that Congress won\u2019t be able to block him.\nThe GOP\u2019s complicity is bitterly ironic because at the same time, Republicans are decrying a presidential coup against the national legislature of Venezuela. Unlike the United States, Venezuela is awash in economic chaos and political repression. But the behavior of Trump and his party since the November midterms bears an uncanny resemblance to the behavior of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his party after they lost that country\u2019s 2015 legislative elections. Trump says Venezuela illustrates the perils of socialism. But it also illustrates the perils of authoritarianism, which the Republican Party of the United States now supports.\nIn December 2015, Venezuelans expressed their disgust with Maduro by electing the opposition to take over the National Assembly. Maduro ignored their rebuke. He declared a national emergency that gave him, according to the New York Times, \u201cthe power to bypass the National Assembly on spending matters.\u201d In May 2016, Maduro renewed the emergency declaration, falsely claiming that the country faced a threat of invasion. He accused the opposition of petition fraud, obstructionism, and trying to impeach him.\nThe assembly voted to reject the emergency declaration. Lawmakers warned that no Venezuelan president had ever undertaken such emergency measures in defiance of a vote of the legislature. But Maduro\u2019s allies on the supreme court upheld his declaration, and he plowed ahead. In the United States, Republicans mocked Maduro\u2019s talk of an invasion and condemned him for overriding the assembly. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called it a coup. \u201cDemocracy has been canceled,\u201d said Rubio. \u201cYou have an elected national assembly being ignored.\u201d\nThe assembly passed laws restricting Maduro\u2019s authority. He ignored them, and the court upheld his right to act without legislative approval. In 2017, when he created an alternative legislative body, the Trump administration denounced his \u201cpower grab\u201d and demanded that he \u201crespect Venezuela\u2019s constitution.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence protested that Maduro had \u201cignored and undermined the National Assembly.\u201d Trump imposed sanctions, claiming that Maduro had \u201cusurped the power of the democratically elected National Assembly.\u201d\nIn February 2018, Maduro seized more financial power by creating a digital currency. The assembly declared this move unconstitutional and void, but Maduro dismissed its verdict. Trump responded by imposing sanctions on anyone who used the new currency to evade sanctions. In its explanation of the sanctions, the Trump administration protested that Maduro had issued the currency \u201cin a process that Venezuela\u2019s democratically elected National Assembly has denounced as unlawful.\u201d\nLast month, Trump went further. He announced that the United States would recognize the assembly\u2019s president, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as Venezuela\u2019s true president. The assembly was \u201cduly elected by the Venezuelan people,\u201d said Trump. On this basis, the United States would honor Guaid\u00f3\u2019s declaration that he, not Maduro, was the country\u2019s legitimate leader. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pointed out that Guaid\u00f3 \u201cmade this declaration with the full support of the National Assembly.\u201d\nLike Maduro, Trump ignored precedents that had previously limited the assertion of emergency powers.\nHouse Republicans agreed that Maduro trampled the assembly and had to be stopped. Republican Whip Steve Scalise thanked Trump for \u201cstanding with the Venezuelan people\u201d against Maduro. Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said America had to ensure that \u201cdemocracy [is] restored for the people of Venezuela.\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney, chair of the House Republican Conference, praised \u201cUS efforts to support freedom for the people of Venezuela.\u201d Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a leading GOP voice on foreign policy, called on Americans to stand with Venezuelans against \u201cthe tyranny of Maduro.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the Republican position on authoritarianism in Venezuela. But at home, the Republican position is just the opposite. In November, Americans expressed their disgust with Trump\u2014a president who never even won the popular vote\u2014by electing the opposition to take over the House of Representatives. The new Congress voted to reject Trump\u2019s demand for $5.7 billion to build a border wall. Trump, like Maduro, responded by dismissing the will of the legislature. He declared a national emergency and asserted, through his control of the military, the power to spend money that Congress, in its exercise of constitutionally assigned power, had refused to appropriate.\nLike Maduro, Trump accused the opposition of voter fraud, obstructionism, and trying to impeach him. Like Maduro, Trump claimed that he had to assume unilateral authority because his country faced a fictional \u201cinvasion.\u201d Like Maduro, Trump ignored precedents that had previously limited the assertion of emergency powers. Like Maduro, he hopes his allies on the Supreme Court will stand by him.\nOn Tuesday, House Republicans voted 182 to 13 against a resolution to terminate Trump\u2019s power grab. They couldn\u2019t stop the resolution, because Democrats hold the majority. But the GOP\u2019s votes are enough to ensure that when Trump vetoes the resolution, as he has pledged to do, the House can\u2019t override his veto. The Republican Party has decided to stand not for the rule of law, but for the rule of Trump. It is no longer a republican party.\nAt a press conference on Tuesday morning, House Republicans defended Trump\u2019s declaration and endorsed his deployment of the U.S. military to the southern border. \u201cThe president has the authority to do it,\u201d said McCarthy. \u201cThere is an emergency at the border,\u201d said Cheney. \u201cThis is a national emergency,\u201d agreed Kinzinger. Scalise claimed that \u201cthere\u2019s no physical barrier to control our border\u201d\u2014which is false\u2014and vowed that Republicans would \u201cstand with the president.\u201d He insisted, \u201cThe president is on strong legal ground to declare this emergency.\u201d\nWe are not Venezuela. We don\u2019t have runaway inflation and crime, corrupt state control of the economy, or routine incarceration for political dissent. But we do have the first two ingredients: a president willing to seize power, and a party willing to block the legislature from stopping him. It\u2019s not the left that is threatening to turn the United States into Venezuela. It\u2019s the right.",

This is a stain on America. And we&rsquo;re not going to fix that, we&rsquo;re not going to change that, until we address it head-on, directly. And it&rsquo;s not just the original founding. It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened generation after generation. The impact of discrimination handed down from one to the next means that today in America because of housing discrimination, because of employment discrimination, if the average white family has $100, the average black family has about $5. So I believe it&rsquo;s time to start the national full-blown conversation about reparations in this country. And that means I support the bill in the House to appoint a congressional panel of experts, of people who are studying this, who talk about different ways we may be able to do it, and to make a report back to Congress so that we can as a nation do what&rsquo;s right and begin to heal.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Warren noted that one way to discuss reparations is within &ldquo;the frame of an apology, the frame of national recognition.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Here, meanwhile, is Ta-Nehisi Coates, in a <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/ta-nehisi-coates-race-politics-2020-elections.html#access_token=E-tclku4zzsTd26DqWjJ03YCPucWMgVU&scope=openid%20profile%20email&expires_in=7200&token_type=Bearer&state=iUeqTjnpNz-gpJMub22SLPzmHEYfeQxy&id_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6Ik1FSXlNVFZETTBaQlEwUTJSVUV6UkVVMlFqWTNNRU13TVRaR09UWTFNVE0yUTBZeE16RXpOQSJ9.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-LTcifQ.W1QqMhjrYGglwRr4gTI7IV1ql2iuI7utsFmwL9TwQDYOMdjFCcP1yVYIjd6YMRCQ3Hof6K-1nojG_sYfVkSSu3AK4Vk4S9bbeL4-DuvnM78eRVoB0zE1GIfyhz0pOyCf5gJoOQ70w217HB_il1i1uPRT6efkEjvux3aS_b3t7-Z30kI1ZbTohI7IqfwL_lcgv7oMBD1XZWh6UYHvhXNfo4mrntdUmLbTk1xG2mTRPJGqioWEUa1L53RQbnzGGQWTpgTHPBcsQIaZU7yaEseCBDsZt9pjPrtgX5pfGZOT3uJcIE-7ecPde1z_-iLOcjRBgrlwCvluxUU_oglXmGbguw\">new interview</a> with Eric Levitz at New York magazine, discussing the way he thinks the argument outlined in his 2014 Atlantic article &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/\">The Case for Reparations</a>&rdquo; could fit practically into the current political discourse:</p>\n<blockquote data-uri=\"slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cjtg3vu7i002s3h5wt75w0iz8@published\" data-word-count=\"207\"> <p>In terms of political candidates, and how this should be talked about, and how this should be dealt with, it seems like it would be to support <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/40\">HR 40.</a> That&rsquo;s the bill that says you form a commission. You study what damage was done from slavery, and the legacy of slavery, and then you try to figure out the best ways to remedy it. It&rsquo;s pretty simple. I think that&rsquo;s Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s position at this point.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a whole line of thinking that says the recommendation for a study is somehow like a cop-out or weak. I don&rsquo;t really understand why that would be the case. Look, if you have a sickness, you have an illness, you probably start with diagnosis. The first step is to get some idea of what actually happened. We&rsquo;ve never really done that. You&rsquo;re talking about an epic crime that literally has its origins before there was a United States of America, and carries all the way up to this very day &hellip; You need time. You need people to actually put some resources behind an actual study &hellip; If we&rsquo;re going to do it, then let&rsquo;s do it. Let&rsquo;s put it all out there. Let&rsquo;s tell folks how we imagine this new America being.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Levitz asked Coates about polling results that show the idea of reparations to be <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-reparations-and-other-race-related-questions/\">broadly unpopular</a>. In response, Coates argues that part of the reason such poll results exist is because mainstream political figures have always treated reparations as too radical an idea to touch&mdash;in his words, &ldquo;the people who have the megaphone not taking it seriously at all.&rdquo; Well, Warren seems to be.</p>\n<p>Other 2020 candidates, most prominently Kamala Harris, have also endorsed the broad idea of reparations (and it&rsquo;s true that Pelosi has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/431857-pelosi-says-she-supports-bill-to-study-issue-of-reparations-for-slavery\">said she&rsquo;d back HR 40</a>). But where Harris has <a href=\"http://Later%20in%20the%20town%20hall,%20when%20Warren%20talked%20about%20her%20housing%20affordability%20plan,%20she%20noted%20that%20%E2%80%9Cinto%20the%201960s%20in%20America,%20the%20federal%20government%20was%20subsidizing%20the%20purchase%20of%20homes%20for%20white%20families%20and%20discriminating%20against%20black%20families.%20That%E2%80%99s%20redlining.%E2%80%9D%20The%20history%20of%20redlining%20was%20a%20crucial%20part%20of%20Coates%E2%80%99%20argument%20in%20the%20Atlantic,%20conveying%20the%20way%20that%20even%20white%20Americans%20who%20might%20say%20that%20their%20ancestors%20weren%E2%80%99t%20responsible%20for%20slavery%20benefited%20(and%20continue%20to%20benefit)%20from%20its%20legacy.%20That,%20again,%20is%20not%20something%20you/\">argued</a> that facially race-neutral programs that happen to disproportionately benefit black Americans would count as reparations, Warren is more directly adopting a Coates-like framing of the issue. Later in the town hall, for example, when Warren talked about her housing affordability plan, she noted that &ldquo;into the 1960s in America, the federal government was subsidizing the purchase of homes for white families and discriminating against black families. That&rsquo;s redlining.&rdquo; The history of redlining was a crucial part of Coates&rsquo; argument in the Atlantic, conveying the way that even white Americans who might say their ancestors weren&rsquo;t responsible for slavery benefited (and continue to benefit) from its legacy.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that, from Warren&rsquo;s perspective, supporting HR 40 does mean somewhat conveniently that she doesn&rsquo;t have to describe the specifics of a program that would redistribute wealth to black Americans. Still, by talking about redlining and the ongoing benefits that white Americans derive from segregation, Warren is endorsing (broadly speaking) a worldview that was on the radical edge of the media-politics ideas ecosphere just five years ago. It&rsquo;s the kind of envelope-pushing position that you might expect from a younger candidate hoping simply to shift the terms of national debate&mdash;or to benefit from the national exposure of a presidential run. But Warren is 69, and she&rsquo;s already a senator and nationally known figure. She gets little out of this campaign if she doesn&rsquo;t win, and her position is an electoral risk, especially given that roughly <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-if-early-democratic-primary-states-looked-more-like-the-party/\">90 percent</a> of the Democrats who participate in the Iowa caucus are white.</p>\n<p>On that front, Warren furthermore said at the Jackson town hall that she thinks Confederate monuments should be removed from public spaces, which is another position that&rsquo;s generally unpopular among white people, and that the Electoral College should be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1107830449118810114\">abolished</a> in favor of a national popular vote for president, which would reduce the political influence of the disproportionately white, rural population in states like Iowa and New Hampshire. As a member of a party that has <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/11/pelosi-schumer-democratic-messaging-is-extremely-bad.html\">long lived in fear of the white moderate</a>, especially on racial issues, Warren is running her primary campaign into uncharted territory. It&rsquo;s exciting!</p>",

                "text": "Here\u2019s Elizabeth Warren answering a question about slavery at a CNN town hall on Monday night in Jackson, Mississippi.\nAmerica was founded on principles of liberty and freedom and on the backs of slave labor. This is a stain on America. And we\u2019re not going to fix that, we\u2019re not going to change that, until we address it head-on, directly. And it\u2019s not just the original founding. It\u2019s what\u2019s happened generation after generation. The impact of discrimination handed down from one to the next means that today in America because of housing discrimination, because of employment discrimination, if the average white family has $100, the average black family has about $5. So I believe it\u2019s time to start the national full-blown conversation about reparations in this country. And that means I support the bill in the House to appoint a congressional panel of experts, of people who are studying this, who talk about different ways we may be able to do it, and to make a report back to Congress so that we can as a nation do what\u2019s right and begin to heal.\nWarren noted that one way to discuss reparations is within \u201cthe frame of an apology, the frame of national recognition.\u201d\nHere, meanwhile, is Ta-Nehisi Coates, in a new interview with Eric Levitz at New York magazine, discussing the way he thinks the argument outlined in his 2014 Atlantic article \u201cThe Case for Reparations\u201d could fit practically into the current political discourse:\nIn terms of political candidates, and how this should be talked about, and how this should be dealt with, it seems like it would be to support HR 40. That\u2019s the bill that says you form a commission. You study what damage was done from slavery, and the legacy of slavery, and then you try to figure out the best ways to remedy it. It\u2019s pretty simple. I think that\u2019s Nancy Pelosi\u2019s position at this point.\nThere\u2019s a whole line of thinking that says the recommendation for a study is somehow like a cop-out or weak. I don\u2019t really understand why that would be the case. Look, if you have a sickness, you have an illness, you probably start with diagnosis. The first step is to get some idea of what actually happened. We\u2019ve never really done that. You\u2019re talking about an epic crime that literally has its origins before there was a United States of America, and carries all the way up to this very day \u2026 You need time. You need people to actually put some resources behind an actual study \u2026 If we\u2019re going to do it, then let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s put it all out there. Let\u2019s tell folks how we imagine this new America being.\nLevitz asked Coates about polling results that show the idea of reparations to be broadly unpopular. In response, Coates argues that part of the reason such poll results exist is because mainstream political figures have always treated reparations as too radical an idea to touch\u2014in his words, \u201cthe people who have the megaphone not taking it seriously at all.\u201d Well, Warren seems to be.\nOther 2020 candidates, most prominently Kamala Harris, have also endorsed the broad idea of reparations (and it\u2019s true that Pelosi has said she\u2019d back HR 40). But where Harris has argued that facially race-neutral programs that happen to disproportionately benefit black Americans would count as reparations, Warren is more directly adopting a Coates-like framing of the issue. Later in the town hall, for example, when Warren talked about her housing affordability plan, she noted that \u201cinto the 1960s in America, the federal government was subsidizing the purchase of homes for white families and discriminating against black families. That\u2019s redlining.\u201d The history of redlining was a crucial part of Coates\u2019 argument in the Atlantic, conveying the way that even white Americans who might say their ancestors weren\u2019t responsible for slavery benefited (and continue to benefit) from its legacy.\nIt should be noted that, from Warren\u2019s perspective, supporting HR 40 does mean somewhat conveniently that she doesn\u2019t have to describe the specifics of a program that would redistribute wealth to black Americans. Still, by talking about redlining and the ongoing benefits that white Americans derive from segregation, Warren is endorsing (broadly speaking) a worldview that was on the radical edge of the media-politics ideas ecosphere just five years ago. It\u2019s the kind of envelope-pushing position that you might expect from a younger candidate hoping simply to shift the terms of national debate\u2014or to benefit from the national exposure of a presidential run. But Warren is 69, and she\u2019s already a senator and nationally known figure. She gets little out of this campaign if she doesn\u2019t win, and her position is an electoral risk, especially given that roughly 90 percent of the Democrats who participate in the Iowa caucus are white.\nOn that front, Warren furthermore said at the Jackson town hall that she thinks Confederate monuments should be removed from public spaces, which is another position that\u2019s generally unpopular among white people, and that the Electoral College should be abolished in favor of a national popular vote for president, which would reduce the political influence of the disproportionately white, rural population in states like Iowa and New Hampshire. As a member of a party that has long lived in fear of the white moderate, especially on racial issues, Warren is running her primary campaign into uncharted territory. It\u2019s exciting!",

That is down from 10 last year and 13 the year before.</p>\n<p>The Bronx High School of Science had similarly dismal numbers: 12 offers for black students out of a class of 803.</p>\n<p>According to the Times, Mayor Bill de Blasio has proposed eliminating the high-stakes entrance exam for admission to the high schools and finding an alternative merit-based method of doing admissions. The proposal has been met with pushback from state legislators and Asian American groups, as a population of mostly low-income Asian students make up the majority of these schools&rsquo; student bodies.</p>\n<p>The city had made efforts to improve diversity at the schools by offering admissions to students from disadvantaged families who score <a href=\"https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2019/03/18/as-admissions-controversy-roils-data-shows-new-york-citys-specialized-high-schools-continue-to-accept-few-black-and-hispanic-students/\">just below the exam cutoff</a>. The schools also began administering the exam on campus during school days, instead of on the weekend at central locations. This effort, it turned out, benefited mostly white and Asian students, according to <a href=\"https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2018/11/01/nyc-is-offering-the-shsat-during-school-hours-but-its-mostly-benefitting-white-and-asian-students/\">Chalkbeat</a>.</p>\n<p>Black and Hispanic students make up nearly 70 percent of the city&rsquo;s public school system, which has roughly 600 schools. Only about 10 percent of the students at any of the eight specialized schools were black or Hispanic. That statistic remained virtually unchanged from previous years.</p>\n<p>The issue of segregation in the city&rsquo;s schools extends far beyond its eight most elite: A 2014 UCLA report concluded that New York state had the most segregated schools in the country. A school diversity panel, commissioned by the mayor, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/02/12/new-york-city-should-set-ambitious-diversity-goals-public-schools-new-report-by-panel-commissioned-by-mayor/?utm_term=.457a65723c3c\">concluded</a> this year that the city had done little since then to reflect New York&rsquo;s larger diversity and that, across the city, schools remained deeply segregated.</p>",

                "text": "New data released by New York City on Monday revealed that the city\u2019s most elite public high schools admitted just a tiny number of black and Hispanic students, according the New York Times.\nThe numbers are stark: New York\u2019s top school, Stuyvesant High School, admitted just seven black students for a freshman class of 895. That is down from 10 last year and 13 the year before.\nThe Bronx High School of Science had similarly dismal numbers: 12 offers for black students out of a class of 803.\nAccording to the Times, Mayor Bill de Blasio has proposed eliminating the high-stakes entrance exam for admission to the high schools and finding an alternative merit-based method of doing admissions. The proposal has been met with pushback from state legislators and Asian American groups, as a population of mostly low-income Asian students make up the majority of these schools\u2019 student bodies.\nThe city had made efforts to improve diversity at the schools by offering admissions to students from disadvantaged families who score just below the exam cutoff. The schools also began administering the exam on campus during school days, instead of on the weekend at central locations. This effort, it turned out, benefited mostly white and Asian students, according to Chalkbeat.\nBlack and Hispanic students make up nearly 70 percent of the city\u2019s public school system, which has roughly 600 schools. Only about 10 percent of the students at any of the eight specialized schools were black or Hispanic. That statistic remained virtually unchanged from previous years.\nThe issue of segregation in the city\u2019s schools extends far beyond its eight most elite: A 2014 UCLA report concluded that New York state had the most segregated schools in the country. A school diversity panel, commissioned by the mayor, concluded this year that the city had done little since then to reflect New York\u2019s larger diversity and that, across the city, schools remained deeply segregated.",

Brenton Tarrant, an Australian man, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/asia/new-zealand-shooting-updates-christchurch.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage\">reportedly traveled</a> to New Zealand, where he allegedly killed 49 worshippers at two mosques, wounding dozens of others. In addition, Tarrant appears to have been inspired by a 2011 attack in Norway, praised current U.S. political figures, and drew on U.S.-based social media platforms to spread his message. (Tarrant may have also had several accomplices.)</p>\n<p>Just as jihadis look to figures like al-Qaida in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi or the Paris attackers as they plan their own violence, white nationalists like Tarrant now look globally before they strike. Anders Breivik, who killed eight people in a car bombing in Oslo and then 69 more in a sustained shooting attack on a summer camp for youth members of Norway&rsquo;s Labor Party, wrote a 1,500 page manifesto he posted online before carrying out his massacre. Terrorism analysts believe that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/nz-manifesto-resembles-norway-mass-murderers-text/2019/03/15/6626ee02-470f-11e9-94ab-d2dda3c0df52_story.html?utm_term=.2da48e541563\">Tarrant saw Breivik as a model</a>, aping his anti-migrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Tarrant <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-ie/news/world/new-zealand-mosque-shooter-brenton-tarrant-says-attack-inspired-by-anders-breivik/ar-BBUNE9J\">declared</a> in his own manifesto, &ldquo;I have read the writings of [Charleston, South Carolina, church shooter] Dylann Roof and many others, but only really took true inspiration from Knight Justiciar Breivik,&rdquo; referring to Breivik by the Norwegian&rsquo;s self-image as a heroic defender of Christian civilization. <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-zealand-shooting-who-was-ebba-akerlund-whose-death-mosque-shooter-used-as-pretext-for-revenge\">Tarrant also claimed he was avenging the killing</a>, in Sweden, of an 11-year old girl, who was run down by an asylum-seeker from Uzbekistan who drove a truck through a crowd in 2017.</p>\n<p>Breivik is more than an ideological model&mdash;he is also a model for action. His mix of attacks, a car bombing and a shooting spree, combined with posting a long &ldquo;treatise&rdquo; to justify his murder offers a template for other white nationalists to follow, just as <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/thresholds-of-violence\">Columbine offered a model</a> for troubled youths to conduct school shootings.</p>\n<p>Because of the increasingly international nature of right-wing violence, the response must be international as well.</p>\n<p>Right-wingers, however, are not just looking to the past. Tarrant also <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/gunman-opens-fire-in-christchurch-mosque/news-story/6f6ce5dc9db6cde5edf5ae778b6da368\">expressed admiration</a> for President Donald Trump &ldquo;as a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose&rdquo; and made reference to Black Lives Matter and Democratic Party <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/candace-owens-ripped-for-lol-reaction-after-new-zealand-massacre-suspect-named-her-biggest-influence/\">critic Candace Owens</a>. The reference to Owens may have been ironic&mdash;the document if rife with trolling and online in-jokes&mdash;but suggests a deep familiarity with U.S. culture war flashpoints. One would think that an Australian targeting New Zealand would not focus on America-specific concerns or personalities, but the broader issues&mdash;opposition to immigrants, hatred of racial and religious minorities, and scorn for liberals&mdash;are sadly more universal and show up in different forms in much of the world.</p>\n<p>The technologies used to spread the word are also global. Tarrant apparently <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/gunman-opens-fire-in-christchurch-mosque/news-story/6f6ce5dc9db6cde5edf5ae778b6da368\">warned before the attack</a> that he would livestream his violence on Facebook. He then used a helmet camera to do this while posting links to his own manifesto on Twitter and the message board 8chan. Although the major internet companies have been working to take down his content, it is likely to survive on at least some platforms and, as its author intended, inspire others to act.</p>\n<p>Because of the increasingly international nature of right-wing violence, the response must be international as well. <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/intelligence-liaison-and-counterterrorism-quick-primer\">Intelligence cooperation</a>, honed to a fine edge in the struggle against the Islamic State and other jihadi groups, can also be used against right-wing organizations. This would involve sharing information on known activists, tracking their connections across borders, disrupting attempts to fundraise in other countries, and otherwise making sure that pressure on these networks is not confined to national borders.</p>\n<p>Because <a href=\"https://www.voxpol.eu/new-research-report-the-alt-right-twitter-census-by-j-m-berger/\">right-wing organizations exploit social media</a>, technology companies must be part of the solution. Some of this effort should involve taking down right-wing sites and blocking prominent users, just as internet companies already do for jihadi groups. Some <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2019/3/14/18265796/slack-removes-accounts-hate-groups-moderation-chat\">companies are already starting to take such measures.</a> But there is more to be done than takedowns. Jigsaw and its partners, for example, <a href=\"https://redirectmethod.org/\">designed a program to &ldquo;redirect&rdquo; individuals</a> seeking jihadi content online to content that tried to turn them away from violence and radical ideas. Similar content for right-wing extremism should be created and promoted by social media companies. Borderline content might be prevented from being monetized, have the comments functioned disabled, and otherwise be limited in how it might spread.</p>\n<p>The United States also needs to revisit the legal basis for going after right-wing terrorism and draw on its international power to do so. At the very least, existing counterterrorism laws should be applied to right-wing groups when appropriate. For example, <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/road-map-congress-address-domestic-terrorism\">Mary McCord and Jason Blazakis point out</a> that groups like the Atomwaffen Division <a href=\"https://medium.com/americanodyssey/atomwaffen-division-germany-announces-preparations-for-last-long-fight-in-latest-video-49aa0be8ff28\">have a presence in Germany</a> as well as the United States and thus could be designated as a foreign terrorist organization&ndash;a move that would subject the group&rsquo;s followers to devastating legal and financial consequences. More broadly, the United States should consider legislation to <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/treating-right-wing-violence-terrorism-what-if-deeds-match-rhetoric\">expand government powers</a> to go after white nationalist and similar groups. The rules should be different than going after jihadis, but many of the principles still apply.</p>\n<p>We know white nationalist and other forms of right-wing violence are here to stay. The true question is whether the United States and other governments will treat it with the seriousness it deserves and work together to counter this growing international scourge.</p>",

                "text": "Right-wing violence is usually considered a dangerous form of domestic terrorism, but the horrific attack on two mosques in New Zealand on Friday shows its growing international dimensions. Brenton Tarrant, an Australian man, reportedly traveled to New Zealand, where he allegedly killed 49 worshippers at two mosques, wounding dozens of others. In addition, Tarrant appears to have been inspired by a 2011 attack in Norway, praised current U.S. political figures, and drew on U.S.-based social media platforms to spread his message. (Tarrant may have also had several accomplices.)\nJust as jihadis look to figures like al-Qaida in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi or the Paris attackers as they plan their own violence, white nationalists like Tarrant now look globally before they strike. Anders Breivik, who killed eight people in a car bombing in Oslo and then 69 more in a sustained shooting attack on a summer camp for youth members of Norway\u2019s Labor Party, wrote a 1,500 page manifesto he posted online before carrying out his massacre. Terrorism analysts believe that Tarrant saw Breivik as a model, aping his anti-migrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Tarrant declared in his own manifesto, \u201cI have read the writings of [Charleston, South Carolina, church shooter] Dylann Roof and many others, but only really took true inspiration from Knight Justiciar Breivik,\u201d referring to Breivik by the Norwegian\u2019s self-image as a heroic defender of Christian civilization. Tarrant also claimed he was avenging the killing, in Sweden, of an 11-year old girl, who was run down by an asylum-seeker from Uzbekistan who drove a truck through a crowd in 2017.\nBreivik is more than an ideological model\u2014he is also a model for action. His mix of attacks, a car bombing and a shooting spree, combined with posting a long \u201ctreatise\u201d to justify his murder offers a template for other white nationalists to follow, just as Columbine offered a model for troubled youths to conduct school shootings.\nBecause of the increasingly international nature of right-wing violence, the response must be international as well.\nRight-wingers, however, are not just looking to the past. Tarrant also expressed admiration for President Donald Trump \u201cas a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose\u201d and made reference to Black Lives Matter and Democratic Party critic Candace Owens. The reference to Owens may have been ironic\u2014the document if rife with trolling and online in-jokes\u2014but suggests a deep familiarity with U.S. culture war flashpoints. One would think that an Australian targeting New Zealand would not focus on America-specific concerns or personalities, but the broader issues\u2014opposition to immigrants, hatred of racial and religious minorities, and scorn for liberals\u2014are sadly more universal and show up in different forms in much of the world.\nThe technologies used to spread the word are also global. Tarrant apparently warned before the attack that he would livestream his violence on Facebook. He then used a helmet camera to do this while posting links to his own manifesto on Twitter and the message board 8chan. Although the major internet companies have been working to take down his content, it is likely to survive on at least some platforms and, as its author intended, inspire others to act.\nBecause of the increasingly international nature of right-wing violence, the response must be international as well. Intelligence cooperation, honed to a fine edge in the struggle against the Islamic State and other jihadi groups, can also be used against right-wing organizations. This would involve sharing information on known activists, tracking their connections across borders, disrupting attempts to fundraise in other countries, and otherwise making sure that pressure on these networks is not confined to national borders.\nBecause right-wing organizations exploit social media, technology companies must be part of the solution. Some of this effort should involve taking down right-wing sites and blocking prominent users, just as internet companies already do for jihadi groups. Some companies are already starting to take such measures. But there is more to be done than takedowns. Jigsaw and its partners, for example, designed a program to \u201credirect\u201d individuals seeking jihadi content online to content that tried to turn them away from violence and radical ideas. Similar content for right-wing extremism should be created and promoted by social media companies. Borderline content might be prevented from being monetized, have the comments functioned disabled, and otherwise be limited in how it might spread.\nThe United States also needs to revisit the legal basis for going after right-wing terrorism and draw on its international power to do so. At the very least, existing counterterrorism laws should be applied to right-wing groups when appropriate. For example, Mary McCord and Jason Blazakis point out that groups like the Atomwaffen Division have a presence in Germany as well as the United States and thus could be designated as a foreign terrorist organization\u2013a move that would subject the group\u2019s followers to devastating legal and financial consequences. More broadly, the United States should consider legislation to expand government powers to go after white nationalist and similar groups. The rules should be different than going after jihadis, but many of the principles still apply.\nWe know white nationalist and other forms of right-wing violence are here to stay. The true question is whether the United States and other governments will treat it with the seriousness it deserves and work together to counter this growing international scourge.",

                "html": "<p>The Supreme Court delivered a brutal blow to immigrants&rsquo; rights on Tuesday morning, ruling that the Trump administration may detain unauthorized immigrants <em>indefinitely </em>once they have been taken into criminal custody. Its 5&ndash;4 decision permits the government to arrest and imprison undocumented individuals who were released from custody years, even decades ago. Even immigrants convicted in the distant past of a minor crime, like possession of a stolen bus transfer, may now be apprehended and detained without bond. To reach this result, the court&rsquo;s conservative justices manipulated the plain text of a federal statute and ignored basic principles of due process. Their decision hands Immigration and Customs Enforcement even more power to terrorize immigrant communities, suspending due process for certain unauthorized immigrants snatched up by ICE.</p>\n<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/16-1363_a86c.pdf\">ruling</a> in <em>Nielsen v. Preap </em>revolves around a 1996 <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/illegal_immigration_reform_and_immigration_responsibility_act\">law</a> designed to crack down on unauthorized immigration. One <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1226\">section</a> of the statute compels the Department of Homeland Security to detain certain non-citizens without a bond hearing as the government awaits permission to deport them. This provision states that immigration officials &ldquo;shall take into custody&rdquo; any unauthorized immigrant who has committed a certain criminal offense &ldquo;when the alien is released&rdquo; from jail. (Qualifying offenses include crimes of &ldquo;moral turpitude,&rdquo; drug violations, and aggravated felonies.) Officials may not release these individuals prior to deportation unless they are participating in witness protection. ICE interprets this statute to permit it agents to arrest and detain any unauthorized immigrant who was convicted of a crime, then hold him without a bond hearing. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the immigrant was convicted a half-century ago and has fully rejoined his community; according to ICE, he remains subject to indefinite detention.</p>\n<p>If Congress truly did prescribe the result outlined by the majority, it has trammeled immigrants&rsquo; constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union, which <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/nielsen-preap-aclu-neil-gorsuch-briefs.html\">brought this case</a> on behalf of multiple immigrants ensnared by ICE, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/16/16-1363/58566/20180806152456058_No%2016%201363%20Kirsten%20M%20Nielsen%20v%20Mony%20Preap%20et%20al%20Brief%20for%20Respondents.pdf\">read the law</a> differently. The ACLU notes that the statute has two parts: First, it directs the government to take certain aliens into custody &ldquo;<em>when the alien is released</em>&rdquo; from prison; second, it instructs the government to hold aliens &ldquo;described in&rdquo; this first section without bond. (Emphasis mine.) The ACLU argues that the law does not give ICE a blank check to arrest and indefinitely detain these aliens years after they&rsquo;ve been freed. Instead, it gives ICE an opportunity to detain immigrants without bond&mdash;<em>if </em>agents arrest them &ldquo;when&rdquo; they&rsquo;re released from custody. If ICE instead waits for months, years, or decades to arrest these individuals, the ACLU asserts, they must treat them like other unauthorized immigrants by providing them with an opportunity for release.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs in <em>Preap</em>, who were picked up by ICE long after they completed their criminal sentences, are not asking for much. They are not asking for guaranteed freedom, just a bond hearing to prove that they aren&rsquo;t flight risks or dangers to their communities. Most would probably meet that standard because they have families and roots and gave up crime long ago. But ICE won&rsquo;t give them the chance to prove it, citing the 1996 statute. And now the Supreme Court has agreed with the Trump administration&rsquo;s reading of the law&mdash;by essentially ignoring a substantial portion of the text itself.</p>\n<p>Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, held that this &ldquo;when &hellip; released&rdquo; clause &ldquo;plays no role in identifying&rdquo; which aliens must be arrested and held without bond. To the contrary, Alito, claimed, these words merely clarify that ICE cannot &ldquo;cut short an alien&rsquo;s state prison sentence in order to usher him more easily right into immigration detention.&rdquo; They also &ldquo;exhor[t] the Secretary to act quickly&rdquo; once an unauthorized immigrant is freed, but do not <em>require </em>her to do so. Thus, the government can wait years to detain an immigrant who has completed his sentence, and once it arrests him, it can still deny him a bond hearing.</p>\n<p>To Justice Stephen Breyer, who dissented along with his liberal colleagues, this reasoning is dangerous nonsense. &ldquo;The issue may sound technical,&rdquo; he acknowledged. &ldquo;But it is extremely important,&rdquo; because it implicates &ldquo;the longstanding right of virtually all persons to receive a bail hearing.&rdquo; The plain language of the statute, Breyer asserted, resolves this case in favor of the plaintiffs. Remember: The first part of the law directs immigration officials to detain a class of aliens &ldquo;when [they are] released&rdquo; from jail. The second part declares that aliens &ldquo;described in&rdquo; this first section must be held without bond. But an alien who was not detained &ldquo;when&rdquo; he was released from prison&mdash;and is instead seized years after release&mdash;isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;described in&rdquo; the first section. And so he does not qualify as an alien whom ICE must hold without bond.</p>\n<p>Breyer did not argue that these immigrants are permanently shielded from ICE custody. Rather, he wrote that the word &ldquo;when&rdquo; should be interpreted &ldquo;in the same manner as we interpreted other parts of this statute&rdquo;: as <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/533/678/\">creating</a> a six-month time limit. Under Breyer&rsquo;s theory, if ICE detains an unauthorized immigrant who has committed a qualifying crime within six months of his release from jail, he must be held without bond. If ICE waits any longer, it must offer him a bond hearing.</p>\n<p>Breyer also addressed the problem that underlies this litigation: If Congress truly did prescribe the result outlined by the majority, it has trammeled immigrants&rsquo; constitutional rights. The court &ldquo;cannot interpret the words of this specific statute,&rdquo; Breyer wrote, &ldquo;without also considering basic promises that America&rsquo;s legal system has long made to all persons.&rdquo; He continued:</p>\n<blockquote data-uri=\"slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cjtg8no28002l3h5wwuk27yeu@published\" data-word-count=\"114\"> <p>We cannot decide that question without bearing in mind basic American legal values: the Government&rsquo;s duty not to deprive any &ldquo;person&rdquo; of &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; without &ldquo;due process of law&rdquo; &hellip; I would have thought that Congress meant to adhere to these values and did not intend to allow the Government to apprehend persons years after their release from prison and hold them indefinitely without a bail hearing. In my view, the Court should interpret the words of this statute to reflect Congress&rsquo; likely intent, an intent that is consistent with our basic values. &hellip; I fear that the Court&rsquo;s contrary interpretation will work serious harm to the principles for which American law has long stood.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Here, Breyer waves a red flag that <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/justice-alito-just-signaled-the-supreme-courts-conservatives-might-not-consider-immigrants-to-be-people.html\">he raised last year</a> in another case undermining immigrants&rsquo; due process rights. Both the Trump administration and the Supreme Court&rsquo;s conservatives, Breyer <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/15-1204_f29g.pdf\">suggested</a>, doubt whether unauthorized immigrants have <em>any </em>right to due process&mdash;even &ldquo;freedom from arbitrary detention,&rdquo; a right &ldquo;as ancient and important&rdquo; as &ldquo;any found within the Constitution&rsquo;s boundaries.&rdquo; In light of this fundamental guarantee, the court should interpret statutes to avoid the indefinite detention of immigrants.</p>\n<p>Breyer read his <em>Preap </em>dissent from the bench to emphasize his dire concerns. It was so trenchant that it drew a response from Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote to assert that the &ldquo;question before us is narrow&rdquo; and compelled by a law &ldquo;signed by President Clinton.&rdquo; (He does not explain why it matters that &ldquo;President Clinton&rdquo; approved this particular statute.) But Breyer criticized Kavanaugh&rsquo;s attempt to downplay the ruling. &ldquo;In terms of potential consequences and basic American legal traditions,&rdquo; Breyer wrote, &ldquo;the question before us is not a &lsquo;narrow&rsquo; one.&rdquo; Instead, it goes to the heart of the Constitution&rsquo;s guarantee of liberty to all persons, citizen and immigrant alike.</p>\n<p>A professorial and even-tempered justice, Breyer is not prone to overstatement. When he issues a warning this urgent and ominous, we should listen. <em>Preap </em>is another dent in the constitutional rights of immigrants who, as Breyer put it, have &ldquo;established families and put down roots in a community.&rdquo; When ICE seeks to detain these individuals without any chance of release&mdash;years after they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;paid their debt to society&rdquo;&mdash;it must comply with due process. Yet a majority of the justices have now rejected efforts to make ICE honor its detainees&rsquo; constitutional rights. Breyer has good reason for alarm.</p>",

                "text": "The Supreme Court delivered a brutal blow to immigrants\u2019 rights on Tuesday morning, ruling that the Trump administration may detain unauthorized immigrants indefinitely once they have been taken into criminal custody. Its 5\u20134 decision permits the government to arrest and imprison undocumented individuals who were released from custody years, even decades ago. Even immigrants convicted in the distant past of a minor crime, like possession of a stolen bus transfer, may now be apprehended and detained without bond. To reach this result, the court\u2019s conservative justices manipulated the plain text of a federal statute and ignored basic principles of due process. Their decision hands Immigration and Customs Enforcement even more power to terrorize immigrant communities, suspending due process for certain unauthorized immigrants snatched up by ICE.\nTuesday\u2019s ruling in Nielsen v. Preap revolves around a 1996 law designed to crack down on unauthorized immigration. One section of the statute compels the Department of Homeland Security to detain certain non-citizens without a bond hearing as the government awaits permission to deport them. This provision states that immigration officials \u201cshall take into custody\u201d any unauthorized immigrant who has committed a certain criminal offense \u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d from jail. (Qualifying offenses include crimes of \u201cmoral turpitude,\u201d drug violations, and aggravated felonies.) Officials may not release these individuals prior to deportation unless they are participating in witness protection. ICE interprets this statute to permit it agents to arrest and detain any unauthorized immigrant who was convicted of a crime, then hold him without a bond hearing. It doesn\u2019t matter if the immigrant was convicted a half-century ago and has fully rejoined his community; according to ICE, he remains subject to indefinite detention.\nIf Congress truly did prescribe the result outlined by the majority, it has trammeled immigrants\u2019 constitutional rights.\nAttorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought this case on behalf of multiple immigrants ensnared by ICE, read the law differently. The ACLU notes that the statute has two parts: First, it directs the government to take certain aliens into custody \u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d from prison; second, it instructs the government to hold aliens \u201cdescribed in\u201d this first section without bond. (Emphasis mine.) The ACLU argues that the law does not give ICE a blank check to arrest and indefinitely detain these aliens years after they\u2019ve been freed. Instead, it gives ICE an opportunity to detain immigrants without bond\u2014if agents arrest them \u201cwhen\u201d they\u2019re released from custody. If ICE instead waits for months, years, or decades to arrest these individuals, the ACLU asserts, they must treat them like other unauthorized immigrants by providing them with an opportunity for release.\nThe plaintiffs in Preap, who were picked up by ICE long after they completed their criminal sentences, are not asking for much. They are not asking for guaranteed freedom, just a bond hearing to prove that they aren\u2019t flight risks or dangers to their communities. Most would probably meet that standard because they have families and roots and gave up crime long ago. But ICE won\u2019t give them the chance to prove it, citing the 1996 statute. And now the Supreme Court has agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s reading of the law\u2014by essentially ignoring a substantial portion of the text itself.\nJustice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, held that this \u201cwhen \u2026 released\u201d clause \u201cplays no role in identifying\u201d which aliens must be arrested and held without bond. To the contrary, Alito, claimed, these words merely clarify that ICE cannot \u201ccut short an alien\u2019s state prison sentence in order to usher him more easily right into immigration detention.\u201d They also \u201cexhor[t] the Secretary to act quickly\u201d once an unauthorized immigrant is freed, but do not require her to do so. Thus, the government can wait years to detain an immigrant who has completed his sentence, and once it arrests him, it can still deny him a bond hearing.\nTo Justice Stephen Breyer, who dissented along with his liberal colleagues, this reasoning is dangerous nonsense. \u201cThe issue may sound technical,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut it is extremely important,\u201d because it implicates \u201cthe longstanding right of virtually all persons to receive a bail hearing.\u201d The plain language of the statute, Breyer asserted, resolves this case in favor of the plaintiffs. Remember: The first part of the law directs immigration officials to detain a class of aliens \u201cwhen [they are] released\u201d from jail. The second part declares that aliens \u201cdescribed in\u201d this first section must be held without bond. But an alien who was not detained \u201cwhen\u201d he was released from prison\u2014and is instead seized years after release\u2014isn\u2019t \u201cdescribed in\u201d the first section. And so he does not qualify as an alien whom ICE must hold without bond.\nBreyer did not argue that these immigrants are permanently shielded from ICE custody. Rather, he wrote that the word \u201cwhen\u201d should be interpreted \u201cin the same manner as we interpreted other parts of this statute\u201d: as creating a six-month time limit. Under Breyer\u2019s theory, if ICE detains an unauthorized immigrant who has committed a qualifying crime within six months of his release from jail, he must be held without bond. If ICE waits any longer, it must offer him a bond hearing.\nBreyer also addressed the problem that underlies this litigation: If Congress truly did prescribe the result outlined by the majority, it has trammeled immigrants\u2019 constitutional rights. The court \u201ccannot interpret the words of this specific statute,\u201d Breyer wrote, \u201cwithout also considering basic promises that America\u2019s legal system has long made to all persons.\u201d He continued:\nWe cannot decide that question without bearing in mind basic American legal values: the Government\u2019s duty not to deprive any \u201cperson\u201d of \u201cliberty\u201d without \u201cdue process of law\u201d \u2026 I would have thought that Congress meant to adhere to these values and did not intend to allow the Government to apprehend persons years after their release from prison and hold them indefinitely without a bail hearing. In my view, the Court should interpret the words of this statute to reflect Congress\u2019 likely intent, an intent that is consistent with our basic values. \u2026 I fear that the Court\u2019s contrary interpretation will work serious harm to the principles for which American law has long stood.\nHere, Breyer waves a red flag that he raised last year in another case undermining immigrants\u2019 due process rights. Both the Trump administration and the Supreme Court\u2019s conservatives, Breyer suggested, doubt whether unauthorized immigrants have any right to due process\u2014even \u201cfreedom from arbitrary detention,\u201d a right \u201cas ancient and important\u201d as \u201cany found within the Constitution\u2019s boundaries.\u201d In light of this fundamental guarantee, the court should interpret statutes to avoid the indefinite detention of immigrants.\nBreyer read his Preap dissent from the bench to emphasize his dire concerns. It was so trenchant that it drew a response from Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote to assert that the \u201cquestion before us is narrow\u201d and compelled by a law \u201csigned by President Clinton.\u201d (He does not explain why it matters that \u201cPresident Clinton\u201d approved this particular statute.) But Breyer criticized Kavanaugh\u2019s attempt to downplay the ruling. \u201cIn terms of potential consequences and basic American legal traditions,\u201d Breyer wrote, \u201cthe question before us is not a \u2018narrow\u2019 one.\u201d Instead, it goes to the heart of the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of liberty to all persons, citizen and immigrant alike.\nA professorial and even-tempered justice, Breyer is not prone to overstatement. When he issues a warning this urgent and ominous, we should listen. Preap is another dent in the constitutional rights of immigrants who, as Breyer put it, have \u201cestablished families and put down roots in a community.\u201d When ICE seeks to detain these individuals without any chance of release\u2014years after they\u2019ve \u201cpaid their debt to society\u201d\u2014it must comply with due process. Yet a majority of the justices have now rejected efforts to make ICE honor its detainees\u2019 constitutional rights. Breyer has good reason for alarm.",

                "html": "<p>Ever since retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn pleaded guilty as part of a cooperation agreement in December 2017, what he was going to tell special counsel Robert Mueller as part of that deal has been one of the Russia scandal&rsquo;s biggest mysteries. Interest in Flynn&rsquo;s cooperation increased dramatically when Mueller&rsquo;s office recommended no jail time for Flynn, despite grave allegations, because Flynn had provided so much &ldquo;substantial assistance&rdquo; in the probe. But on Thursday, when Attorney General William Barr has promised to release a redacted version of Mueller&rsquo;s report, it seems we are unlikely to find out much about the Flynn episode. In reading between Barr&rsquo;s redactions, we can learn a lot about what the attorney general might be hiding by remembering what we already know about Flynn.</p>\n<p>In a letter to Congress last month, Barr said he would redact four categories of material from the Mueller report: grand jury material, information that could affect other ongoing investigations, information that could infringe on the reputation or privacy of &ldquo;peripheral third parties,&rdquo; and material that could compromise intelligence sources or methods.</p>\n<p>All of this suggests that critical information from Flynn, one of the earliest and more central cooperators of this investigation, will probably be redacted. It was the investigation of Flynn for lying to FBI officers about contacts with the Russian ambassador that President Donald Trump allegedly asked former FBI Director James Comey to drop. It was the revelation of this fact that ultimately led to Mueller&rsquo;s appointment in the first place. And Flynn was one of the first key witnesses to &ldquo;flip&rdquo; and begin cooperating with the government in late 2017.</p>\n<p>If this material is missing from the redacted report, it could tell us that there&rsquo;s a whole lot more being hidden.</p>\n<p>When Mueller recommended Flynn get little to no jail time, Judge Emmet Sullivan was stunned to such a degree that he took the extraordinary step of suggesting he would not take the recommendation. Given that Sullivan has seen more of the facts of Flynn&rsquo;s underlying conduct and even commented that said conduct could be &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-flynns-judge-just-struck-a-potent-blow-for-the-rule-of-law/2018/12/18/ce50a37c-030a-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html?utm_term=.1e29e4c88bf2\">treason</a>&rdquo; (a legal overstatement but nevertheless a remarkable tell), it seems that there&rsquo;s at least some important information that we don&rsquo;t know in what he gave prosecutors and what it might mean for Trump. Sullivan&rsquo;s comments were a hint about the seriousness of what Mueller showed Sullivan in redacted documents&mdash;probably more than a mere Logan Act violation. Further, the fact that Flynn&rsquo;s sentencing has been delayed for additional cooperation, even though <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/12/michael-flynn-cooperating-1219273\">Mueller has said his cooperation is complete</a>, may be enough of a reason&mdash;or a pretext&mdash;for Barr to redact many of Flynn&rsquo;s key statements. All of this background is a reminder that if some of the Flynn material is redacted, it will mean a significant portion of the Mueller report will be hidden from the public.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, some key details of what Flynn is likely to have provided have already been uncovered by the House Oversight Committee, as well as by public reporting. Regardless of what Barr or the courts release from Mueller, this reporting tells Congress and the public a great deal about potential abuse by the Trump administration, including by Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. Flynn was a key figure in the campaign, through the transition, and into the early administration, involved in many of the key events from both the collusion and obstruction investigations. Barr&rsquo;s letter quoted the Mueller report saying, &ldquo;[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.&rdquo; But Flynn&rsquo;s role during the transition and just after the inauguration is critical.*</p>\n<p>The following timeline draws from public reporting and a House oversight interim report from February to establish what we already know about Flynn&rsquo;s role in the Russia scandal. If this material is missing from the redacted report, it could tell us that there&rsquo;s a whole lot more being hidden.</p>\n<p><strong>Nov. 16, 2016:</strong> Rep.

Flynn is still appointed national security adviser and receives provisional security clearance.</p>\n<p><strong>Jan. 15, 2017:</strong> In the wake of news reports that Flynn and Kislyak spoke during the sanctions controversy, Pence <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-michael-flynn-russia-contact-strictly-coincidental/\">states</a> on CBS&rsquo;s <em>Face the Nation</em> that Flynn and Kislyak &ldquo;did not discuss anything having to do with the United States&rsquo; decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.&rdquo; Pence says he was told this by Flynn himself.</p>\n<p><strong>Jan. 20, 2017:</strong> According to reporting in the New York Times, Flynn allegedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/us/politics/michael-flynn-russia-sanctions-ripped-up-whistleblower.html\">texted a former business associate</a> on Inauguration Day that their private firm&rsquo;s plan to build nuclear reactors in the Mideast was &ldquo;good to go&rdquo; because U.S. sanctions on Russia&mdash;which had been blocking these plans&mdash;would soon be &ldquo;ripped up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The House oversight <a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/Trump%20Saudi%20Nuclear%20Report%20-%202-19-2019.pdf\">report</a> in February offered dramatic <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/20/theres-yet-another-trump-administration-scandal-brewing-its-doozy/?utm_term=.376ef49c25b5\">details</a> from whistleblowers about this nuclear power plan. Flynn had reportedly been working with &ldquo;IP3,&rdquo; a group of former generals, along with businessman and Trump confidant Tom Barrack, on an American-Russian-Saudi-UAE nuclear arrangement. According to the House oversight report, &ldquo;one senior political official stated that the proposal was &lsquo;not a business plan,&rsquo; but rather &lsquo;a scheme for these generals to make some money.&rsquo; That official stated: &lsquo;Okay, you know we cannot do this.&rsquo; &rdquo; The plan ultimately advanced the business interests of Westinghouse Electric (specializing in nuclear power), which was subsequently bought by Brookfield Asset Management, which in turn leased Kushner&rsquo;s distressed real estate asset 666 5<sup>th</sup> Ave. for $1.2 billion. Adam Entous offered <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israeli-saudi-and-emirati-officials-privately-pushed-for-trump-to-strike-a-grand-bargain-with-putin\">many more details</a> about this back-and-forth in the New Yorker.</p>\n<p><strong>Jan. 24, 2017:</strong> In an interview with FBI agents, Flynn denies that he spoke about sanctions with Russian officials. He later admits that this is a lie and pleads guilty to a federal crime for lying to investigators.</p>\n<p><strong>Jan. 26, 2017:</strong> Acting Attorney General Sally Yates <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/timeline-sally-yates-warnings-white-house-mike-flynn/story?id=47272979\">tells</a> McGahn, now the White House counsel, that Pence, among others, gave incorrect information about Flynn&rsquo;s Russian contacts. This is a problem, because it means the Russians might be able to blackmail Flynn or the vice president.</p>\n<p><strong>Feb. 9, 2017:</strong> According to Pence&rsquo;s press secretary&rsquo;s later account, Pence was only <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mike-pence-told-about-flynn-warning-11-days-after-trump-n720836\">told about</a> Yates&rsquo; warning about two weeks later.

But Flynn continues in office.</p>\n<p><strong>Feb. 13, 2017:</strong> Flynn resigns.</p>\n<p><strong>Feb. 14, 2017:</strong> Trump meets privately with FBI Director Jim Comey and allegedly asks him to &ldquo;let go&rdquo; of the Flynn &ldquo;thing.&rdquo; (Comey testified to this under oath before a Senate panel, but Trump has denied it is true in public statements.) After Comey is fired and the details of his contemporaneous notes documenting this encounter are revealed to the public, Mueller is appointed as special counsel and eventually begins an obstruction of justice investigation on this basis.</p>\n<p>According to the House oversight report and the Washington Post, Flynn continued his communications with the administration after his dismissal and continued to work on the Russia-Saudi nuclear deal. IP3&rsquo;s team of generals signed a letter stating: &ldquo;The agreements by President Trump and Mohammed bin Salman have established the framework for our unique opportunity to take the next steps with IP3 and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.&rdquo; The letter also referenced a &ldquo;partnership to acquire Westinghouse between IP3 and Saudi Arabia.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>May 8, 2017:</strong> According to later <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/us/politics/trump-comey-firing-letter.html?mcubz=0&module=ArrowsNav&contentCollection=Politics&action=keypress%C2%AEion=FixedLeft&pgtype=article\">reporting</a> in the New York Times, the White House distributes a draft letter written by Trump and Stephen Miller&mdash;described by sources as a &ldquo;screed&rdquo;&mdash; laying out the reasons for firing Comey, including Trump&rsquo;s displeasure that Comey wouldn&rsquo;t publicly say Trump wasn&rsquo;t being investigated in the Russia inquiry. In the Oval Office, Pence and McGahn reportedly review the draft and McGahn reportedly asks that some sections be removed. A version of this letter is sent to Rod Rosenstein, who crafts a new memo justifying the firing and attributing it to Comey&rsquo;s conduct during the Clinton investigation, with no mention of Russia.</p>\n<p><strong>May 9, 2017:</strong> Trump fires Comey.</p>\n<p><strong>Dec. 1, 2017:</strong> Flynn pleads guilty as part of a cooperation agreement.</p>\n<p>Because of the Barr redactions, we may not find out on Thursday what Flynn told Mueller of the circumstances of these Russian contacts and Saudi nuclear plans. But it&rsquo;s clear that the House Oversight Committee is on the case.</p>\n<p>A House subpoena for the report and for testimony from Mueller and from witnesses&mdash;including Flynn himself&mdash;should eventually reveal whatever Barr may try to conceal.</p>\n<p>Update, April 18, 2018: This sentence has been updated for clarity.</p>",

                "text": "Ever since retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn pleaded guilty as part of a cooperation agreement in December 2017, what he was going to tell special counsel Robert Mueller as part of that deal has been one of the Russia scandal\u2019s biggest mysteries. Interest in Flynn\u2019s cooperation increased dramatically when Mueller\u2019s office recommended no jail time for Flynn, despite grave allegations, because Flynn had provided so much \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d in the probe. But on Thursday, when Attorney General William Barr has promised to release a redacted version of Mueller\u2019s report, it seems we are unlikely to find out much about the Flynn episode. In reading between Barr\u2019s redactions, we can learn a lot about what the attorney general might be hiding by remembering what we already know about Flynn.\nIn a letter to Congress last month, Barr said he would redact four categories of material from the Mueller report: grand jury material, information that could affect other ongoing investigations, information that could infringe on the reputation or privacy of \u201cperipheral third parties,\u201d and material that could compromise intelligence sources or methods.\nAll of this suggests that critical information from Flynn, one of the earliest and more central cooperators of this investigation, will probably be redacted. It was the investigation of Flynn for lying to FBI officers about contacts with the Russian ambassador that President Donald Trump allegedly asked former FBI Director James Comey to drop. It was the revelation of this fact that ultimately led to Mueller\u2019s appointment in the first place. And Flynn was one of the first key witnesses to \u201cflip\u201d and begin cooperating with the government in late 2017.\nIf this material is missing from the redacted report, it could tell us that there\u2019s a whole lot more being hidden.\nWhen Mueller recommended Flynn get little to no jail time, Judge Emmet Sullivan was stunned to such a degree that he took the extraordinary step of suggesting he would not take the recommendation. Given that Sullivan has seen more of the facts of Flynn\u2019s underlying conduct and even commented that said conduct could be \u201ctreason\u201d (a legal overstatement but nevertheless a remarkable tell), it seems that there\u2019s at least some important information that we don\u2019t know in what he gave prosecutors and what it might mean for Trump. Sullivan\u2019s comments were a hint about the seriousness of what Mueller showed Sullivan in redacted documents\u2014probably more than a mere Logan Act violation. Further, the fact that Flynn\u2019s sentencing has been delayed for additional cooperation, even though Mueller has said his cooperation is complete, may be enough of a reason\u2014or a pretext\u2014for Barr to redact many of Flynn\u2019s key statements. All of this background is a reminder that if some of the Flynn material is redacted, it will mean a significant portion of the Mueller report will be hidden from the public.\nFortunately, some key details of what Flynn is likely to have provided have already been uncovered by the House Oversight Committee, as well as by public reporting. Regardless of what Barr or the courts release from Mueller, this reporting tells Congress and the public a great deal about potential abuse by the Trump administration, including by Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. Flynn was a key figure in the campaign, through the transition, and into the early administration, involved in many of the key events from both the collusion and obstruction investigations. Barr\u2019s letter quoted the Mueller report saying, \u201c[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\u201d But Flynn\u2019s role during the transition and just after the inauguration is critical.*\nThe following timeline draws from public reporting and a House oversight interim report from February to establish what we already know about Flynn\u2019s role in the Russia scandal. If this material is missing from the redacted report, it could tell us that there\u2019s a whole lot more being hidden.\nNov. 16, 2016: Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, sends a letter to incoming Vice President Mike Pence with concerns about Flynn\u2019s links to Russia and Turkey, and requests more information.\nDec. 1, 2016: Flynn and Jared Kushner meet Russia\u2019s Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at Trump Tower. According to Kushner\u2019s own testimony, Trump\u2019s son-in-law proposed a secret communication link with the Kremlin through the Russian Embassy in an effort to find a \u201csecure line.\u201d\nDec. 13, 2016: Kushner meets Sergey Gorkov, who chairs Russia\u2019s government-owned Vnesheconombank and is President Vladimir Putin\u2019s close confidant. Vnesheconombank is understood by analysts to be Putin\u2019s slush fund and is under strict U.S. sanctions.\nDec. 14, 2016: Gorkov flies to Japan, where he is reported to have met with Putin.\nDec. 28, 2016: Obama orders new sanctions against Russia for election hacking and interference. Kislyak contacts Flynn.\nDec. 29, 2016: According to details later revealed in Flynn\u2019s plea agreement, he calls a \u201csenior official of the Presidential Transition Team\u201d who was with other \u201csenior members of the [team]\u201d at Mar-a-Lago. Flynn and this \u201csenior official\u201d agree that they do not want Russia to \u201cescalate the situation.\u201d Flynn calls Kislyak immediately and afterward reports back to the senior official. Reports suggest that this official was Kushner.\nDec. 30, 2016: Trump tweets to Putin, calling him \u201cvery smart\u201d for not responding to Obama\u2019s sanctions in kind.\nJan. 4, 2017: According to later reporting by the New York Times, Flynn reveals to Don McGahn, chief attorney for the transition effort, that Flynn is under FBI investigation. Flynn is still appointed national security adviser and receives provisional security clearance.\nJan. 15, 2017: In the wake of news reports that Flynn and Kislyak spoke during the sanctions controversy, Pence states on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that Flynn and Kislyak \u201cdid not discuss anything having to do with the United States\u2019 decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.\u201d Pence says he was told this by Flynn himself.\nJan. 20, 2017: According to reporting in the New York Times, Flynn allegedly texted a former business associate on Inauguration Day that their private firm\u2019s plan to build nuclear reactors in the Mideast was \u201cgood to go\u201d because U.S. sanctions on Russia\u2014which had been blocking these plans\u2014would soon be \u201cripped up.\u201d\nThe House oversight report in February offered dramatic details from whistleblowers about this nuclear power plan. Flynn had reportedly been working with \u201cIP3,\u201d a group of former generals, along with businessman and Trump confidant Tom Barrack, on an American-Russian-Saudi-UAE nuclear arrangement. According to the House oversight report, \u201cone senior political official stated that the proposal was \u2018not a business plan,\u2019 but rather \u2018a scheme for these generals to make some money.\u2019 That official stated: \u2018Okay, you know we cannot do this.\u2019 \u201d The plan ultimately advanced the business interests of Westinghouse Electric (specializing in nuclear power), which was subsequently bought by Brookfield Asset Management, which in turn leased Kushner\u2019s distressed real estate asset 666 5th Ave. for $1.2 billion. Adam Entous offered many more details about this back-and-forth in the New Yorker.\nJan. 24, 2017: In an interview with FBI agents, Flynn denies that he spoke about sanctions with Russian officials. He later admits that this is a lie and pleads guilty to a federal crime for lying to investigators.\nJan. 26, 2017: Acting Attorney General Sally Yates tells McGahn, now the White House counsel, that Pence, among others, gave incorrect information about Flynn\u2019s Russian contacts. This is a problem, because it means the Russians might be able to blackmail Flynn or the vice president.\nFeb. 9, 2017: According to Pence\u2019s press secretary\u2019s later account, Pence was only told about Yates\u2019 warning about two weeks later. The Washington Post also reports on this day that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. But Flynn continues in office.\nFeb. 13, 2017: Flynn resigns.\nFeb. 14, 2017: Trump meets privately with FBI Director Jim Comey and allegedly asks him to \u201clet go\u201d of the Flynn \u201cthing.\u201d (Comey testified to this under oath before a Senate panel, but Trump has denied it is true in public statements.) After Comey is fired and the details of his contemporaneous notes documenting this encounter are revealed to the public, Mueller is appointed as special counsel and eventually begins an obstruction of justice investigation on this basis.\nAccording to the House oversight report and the Washington Post, Flynn continued his communications with the administration after his dismissal and continued to work on the Russia-Saudi nuclear deal. IP3\u2019s team of generals signed a letter stating: \u201cThe agreements by President Trump and Mohammed bin Salman have established the framework for our unique opportunity to take the next steps with IP3 and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d The letter also referenced a \u201cpartnership to acquire Westinghouse between IP3 and Saudi Arabia.\u201d\nMay 8, 2017: According to later reporting in the New York Times, the White House distributes a draft letter written by Trump and Stephen Miller\u2014described by sources as a \u201cscreed\u201d\u2014 laying out the reasons for firing Comey, including Trump\u2019s displeasure that Comey wouldn\u2019t publicly say Trump wasn\u2019t being investigated in the Russia inquiry. In the Oval Office, Pence and McGahn reportedly review the draft and McGahn reportedly asks that some sections be removed. A version of this letter is sent to Rod Rosenstein, who crafts a new memo justifying the firing and attributing it to Comey\u2019s conduct during the Clinton investigation, with no mention of Russia.\nMay 9, 2017: Trump fires Comey.\nDec. 1, 2017: Flynn pleads guilty as part of a cooperation agreement.\nBecause of the Barr redactions, we may not find out on Thursday what Flynn told Mueller of the circumstances of these Russian contacts and Saudi nuclear plans. But it\u2019s clear that the House Oversight Committee is on the case.\nA House subpoena for the report and for testimony from Mueller and from witnesses\u2014including Flynn himself\u2014should eventually reveal whatever Barr may try to conceal.\nUpdate, April 18, 2018: This sentence has been updated for clarity.",

The <a href=\"https://nypost.com/cover/covers-for-thursday-april-11-2019/\">April 11 issue</a> featured a photograph of the World Trade Center burning on Sept. 11, 2001, and a response to a quote from Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose line in a recent speech about how terrorists &ldquo;did something&rdquo; on 9/11 has set off a furor among Republicans. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your something: 2,977 people dead by terrorism,&rdquo; the Post&rsquo;s cover blared in response. &ldquo;What The New York Post is doing is endangering the lives of American Muslims and people of color,&rdquo; a leader of the Yemeni American Merchants Association <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/nyregion/new-york-post-boycott.html\">said</a> in announcing the boycott. Among other demands, the group is asking the paper&rsquo;s editor in chief, Stephen Lynch, to resign.</p>\n<p>The Post&rsquo;s foes may want to train their attention on another name in the Post orbit: Col Allan, the paper&rsquo;s former longtime editor in chief who quietly returned as a consultant in January. Joe Pompeo <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/col-allan-is-back-to-help-figure-out-the-posts-trump-coverage\">reported in Vanity Fair</a> that Allan had been sitting next to Lynch in editorial meetings and had installed himself in a conference room at the paper. Sources told Pompeo that Allan&rsquo;s mandate is to hone the paper&rsquo;s coverage of Donald Trump and elevate stories that are &ldquo;on brand&rdquo; with the Post&rsquo;s reputation. (The Post declined to comment on Allan&rsquo;s specific involvement in the Omar cover.)</p>\n<p>The New York Post has always been known for its punchy populism, but Allan&rsquo;s return seems to have injected some new &hellip; heat into its veins. The paper has turned its attention to the so-called border crisis, lamenting &ldquo;<a href=\"https://nypost.com/cover/covers-for-wednesday-april-10-2019/\">DOOR WIDE OPEN</a>&rdquo; on April 13. A few days earlier, when Trump threatened to send immigrants to &ldquo;sanctuary cities,&rdquo; its cover channeled the president&rsquo;s voice, shouting: &ldquo;<a href=\"https://nypost.com/cover/covers-for-saturday-april-13-2019/\">YOU TAKE &rsquo;EM</a>.&rdquo; (The New York Daily News&rsquo; cover the same day read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanClarkReports/status/1117044636026068992\">WE&rsquo;LL TAKE THEM</a>,&rdquo; providing the latest installment in a <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/08/why-nyc-needs-both-the-new-york-post-and-the-daily-news.html\">long-running newsstand debate</a> between the two tabloids.) Along the way, of course, it has also continued to cover classic Post-style stories, one definition of which is: Can we slap a dick joke on this? In February alone, that included Robert Kraft&rsquo;s charge with soliciting a prostitute (&ldquo;<a href=\"https://nypost.com/cover/covers-for-saturday-february-23-2019/\">INFLATE GATE</a>&rdquo;), Jeff Bezos&rsquo; blackmail allegations (&ldquo;<a href=\"https://nypost.com/cover/covers-for-friday-february-8-2019/\">BEZOS EXPOSES PECKER</a>&rdquo;), and Anthony Weiner&rsquo;s release from prison (&ldquo;<a href=\"https://nypost.com/cover/covers-for-monday-february-18-2019/\">WEINER POPS OUT</a>&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>The New York Post has always been known for its punchy populism, but Allan&rsquo;s return seems to have injected some new &hellip; heat into its veins.</p>\n<p>Allan came to the Post in 2001 from Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s Daily Telegraph in Sydney. In New York, the Australian editor saw himself as &ldquo;<a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/media/37257/\">something like Murdoch&rsquo;s id incarnate</a>,&rdquo; as Lloyd Grove wrote in a 2007 profile that depicted Allan as a hard-drinking, temperamental <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-08-21/rudd-in-strip-joint-oh-no-this-wont-do/645778\">strip-club habitu&eacute;</a> with little patience for the stuffy norms of American journalism. Allan took responsibility for a 2004 &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; in which the Post <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oops-ny-post-picks-gephardt/\">wrongly reported</a> that John Kerry had chosen Rep. Dick Gephardt as his running mate. (Murdoch himself was widely assumed to be the source of the bad tip.) After the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, Allan&rsquo;s Post ran a photograph of two men sought by law enforcement, who turned out not to be suspects. Allan went on record <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-york-post-marathon_n_3110673\">standing by the decision</a>, despite widespread criticism that the paper had irresponsibly implied the men were suspects. He <a href=\"http://tktk.gawker.com/source-new-york-post-staffers-openly-disgusted-with-1717736032\">outraged his own staff</a> by assigning 16 reporters to track a mentally ill homeless man for a series of stories about the city&rsquo;s supposed failure to manage its homeless population. By the time he retired in 2016, he was Murdoch&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/15/news-corp-editor-col-allan-retires-murdoch-papers\">longest-serving editor</a>.</p>\n<p>The Post is <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/donald-trump-reading-list\">said to be Trump&rsquo;s favorite newspaper</a>. The paper and the president share a brash, bullying style of urban secular conservatism and an uncanny nose for storylines that will play with aggrieved white people. Shortly before he retired, Allan was rumored to <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/ny-post-editor-allan-wears-trump-hat-newsroom-article-1.2572467\">sport a Make America Great Again hat</a> around the office. The Post&rsquo;s treatment of Trump under his watch <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/27/once-a-thorn-in-trumps-side-new-york-post-appears-all-in-to-make-america-great-again/?utm_term=.9b2d0697b42a\">wasn&rsquo;t exactly reverent</a>: The paper crowed that he&rsquo;d been &ldquo;CRUZ-IFIED&rdquo; when Ted Cruz won the Iowa caucus. But Allan&rsquo;s oversight may augur a renewed relationship with the White House. On <a href=\"https://nypost.com/cover/3-25-covers/\">March 25</a>, it trumpeted the completion of the Mueller report, which it summed up as &ldquo;NO Collusion NO Obstruction: Two years of hysteria end in Trump vindication.&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhUtCD_AxNw\">I like the Donald a lot</a>,&rdquo; Allan said at a 2017 awards ceremony at the Melbourne Press Club. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a tabloid newspaper editor&rsquo;s dream.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Yemeni American bodega owners in New York City stopped selling the New York Post this week in protest of a cover image that was inflammatory even by the standards of the tabloid\u2019s reputation. The April 11 issue featured a photograph of the World Trade Center burning on Sept. 11, 2001, and a response to a quote from Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose line in a recent speech about how terrorists \u201cdid something\u201d on 9/11 has set off a furor among Republicans. \u201cHere\u2019s your something: 2,977 people dead by terrorism,\u201d the Post\u2019s cover blared in response. \u201cWhat The New York Post is doing is endangering the lives of American Muslims and people of color,\u201d a leader of the Yemeni American Merchants Association said in announcing the boycott. Among other demands, the group is asking the paper\u2019s editor in chief, Stephen Lynch, to resign.\nThe Post\u2019s foes may want to train their attention on another name in the Post orbit: Col Allan, the paper\u2019s former longtime editor in chief who quietly returned as a consultant in January. Joe Pompeo reported in Vanity Fair that Allan had been sitting next to Lynch in editorial meetings and had installed himself in a conference room at the paper. Sources told Pompeo that Allan\u2019s mandate is to hone the paper\u2019s coverage of Donald Trump and elevate stories that are \u201con brand\u201d with the Post\u2019s reputation. (The Post declined to comment on Allan\u2019s specific involvement in the Omar cover.)\nThe New York Post has always been known for its punchy populism, but Allan\u2019s return seems to have injected some new \u2026 heat into its veins. The paper has turned its attention to the so-called border crisis, lamenting \u201cDOOR WIDE OPEN\u201d on April 13. A few days earlier, when Trump threatened to send immigrants to \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d its cover channeled the president\u2019s voice, shouting: \u201cYOU TAKE \u2019EM.\u201d (The New York Daily News\u2019 cover the same day read \u201cWE\u2019LL TAKE THEM,\u201d providing the latest installment in a long-running newsstand debate between the two tabloids.) Along the way, of course, it has also continued to cover classic Post-style stories, one definition of which is: Can we slap a dick joke on this? In February alone, that included Robert Kraft\u2019s charge with soliciting a prostitute (\u201cINFLATE GATE\u201d), Jeff Bezos\u2019 blackmail allegations (\u201cBEZOS EXPOSES PECKER\u201d), and Anthony Weiner\u2019s release from prison (\u201cWEINER POPS OUT\u201d).\nThe New York Post has always been known for its punchy populism, but Allan\u2019s return seems to have injected some new \u2026 heat into its veins.\nAllan came to the Post in 2001 from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Daily Telegraph in Sydney. In New York, the Australian editor saw himself as \u201csomething like Murdoch\u2019s id incarnate,\u201d as Lloyd Grove wrote in a 2007 profile that depicted Allan as a hard-drinking, temperamental strip-club habitu\u00e9 with little patience for the stuffy norms of American journalism. Allan took responsibility for a 2004 \u201cexclusive\u201d in which the Post wrongly reported that John Kerry had chosen Rep. Dick Gephardt as his running mate. (Murdoch himself was widely assumed to be the source of the bad tip.) After the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, Allan\u2019s Post ran a photograph of two men sought by law enforcement, who turned out not to be suspects. Allan went on record standing by the decision, despite widespread criticism that the paper had irresponsibly implied the men were suspects. He outraged his own staff by assigning 16 reporters to track a mentally ill homeless man for a series of stories about the city\u2019s supposed failure to manage its homeless population. By the time he retired in 2016, he was Murdoch\u2019s longest-serving editor.\nThe Post is said to be Trump\u2019s favorite newspaper. The paper and the president share a brash, bullying style of urban secular conservatism and an uncanny nose for storylines that will play with aggrieved white people. Shortly before he retired, Allan was rumored to sport a Make America Great Again hat around the office. The Post\u2019s treatment of Trump under his watch wasn\u2019t exactly reverent: The paper crowed that he\u2019d been \u201cCRUZ-IFIED\u201d when Ted Cruz won the Iowa caucus. But Allan\u2019s oversight may augur a renewed relationship with the White House. On March 25, it trumpeted the completion of the Mueller report, which it summed up as \u201cNO Collusion NO Obstruction: Two years of hysteria end in Trump vindication.\u201d \u201cI like the Donald a lot,\u201d Allan said at a 2017 awards ceremony at the Melbourne Press Club. \u201cHe\u2019s a tabloid newspaper editor\u2019s dream.\u201d",

If they do nothing to stop Sanders, then they will have done nothing to stop Sanders. But if they put together some coordinated effort to stop him, then Sanders will channel those efforts into his &ldquo;anti-establishment&rdquo; messaging.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don&rsquo;t moment for leading anti-Sanders figures. It&rsquo;s not particularly complicated, though, why they feel so powerless: Essentially, they are.

The typical response was: Yeah, those people exist, but what can they do about it?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re in a position to move pieces around the chessboard here,&rdquo; Tad Devine, Sanders&rsquo; 2016 chief strategist, told me. (Devine is not working on the current campaign.) &ldquo;If Bernie Sanders starts winning in Iowa and New Hampshire, and has a bunch of resources, and goes in and wins some of these big states and gets 300 or 400 delegates ahead by mid-March, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going to stop him, you know?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What, after all, would a coordinated strategy from such a contingent even look like?

So are we talking &hellip; attack ads? What else?

This time around, though, the Sanders campaign has built up a much more robust political department to capture the many more free agents still looking to make endorsements.

Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks during a weekly news conference at the U.S. Capitol February 14, 2019 in Washington, DC. Speaker Pelosi spoke on various topics...</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The House passed a resolution Tuesday evening to terminate President Trump&rsquo;s declared emergency at the southern border, passing the baton to the Senate, where the resolution faces tougher odds.</p>\n<p>The measure passed the House easily, 245-182, given that Democrats control the chamber, but 13 Republicans bucked leadership and Trump to vote for the resolution.</p>\n<p>The handful of Republican defections was not particularly surprising, as some members of the party have already signaled their disapproval of Trump&rsquo;s national emergency declaration. The House Liberty Caucus, a libertarian-leaning group of conservatives led by Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI), urged its members to vote for the resolution a few hours before the vote. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), another libertarian-leaning member, also said earlier in the day that he would support the measure.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20190225/BILLS-116HJRES46ih.pdf\">resolution</a> marks one of the biggest rebukes to President Trump and the first time that Congress has sought to terminate a national emergency declaration since the power was instated in 1976.</p>\n<p>Now that the House has approved the resolution, a companion measure will be introduced in the Senate soon, setting up a final vote in mid-March. Its chances in the Senate are less clear, given that Republicans control the chamber.</p>\n<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) notably backed Trump&rsquo;s decision to declare a national emergency in order to find funds to build a border wall. Yet, several Republican senators have openly disapproved of the move, and McConnell <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/mcconnell-not-offering-trump-much-help-on-emergency-declaration-vote\">signaled</a> on Tuesday that he won&rsquo;t push his caucus to stick with Trump.</p>\n<p>So far, <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/senate-on-verge-of-blocking-trump-emergency-declaration-with-latest-defection\">three Senate Republicans</a> &mdash; Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina &mdash; have announced that they will vote for the resolution, leaving the measure just one vote short of passage in the Senate.</p>\n<p>Though there&rsquo;s a chance that the measure could pass the Senate, the vote would ultimately be merely symbolic. Trump has <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/wh-officially-says-veto-resolution-terminate-trump-emergency\">threatened</a> to veto the resolution, and it&rsquo;s doubtful that enough Republicans in the Senate will back the resolution to ensure a veto-proof majority.</p>\n<p>Still, if the resolution passes both chambers, it would be a major political blow to Trump, with Congress finally making a significant attempt to reject one of his policies.</p>",

As Vox explains:\nThese are small matters, of course, but inattention to detail as a habit can be very consequential.\nVan Halen used to famously insist that the band be provisioned before playing a show with bowls of M&Ms from which all the brown M&Ms had been removed. This would be buried in the midst of a longish contract document, and the point wasn\u2019t to be fussy about candy; it was to offer a quick way to check whether the organizers had actually read the thing and paid attention to detail.",

Mr. Stone was ...</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Amid suggestions from Roger Stone and his allies that special counsel Robert Mueller inappropriately leaked the charges he brought against the operative, Mueller filed documents confirming that the grand jury indictment was publicly posted only after Stone had been arrested last month.</p>\n<p>The documents were filed at U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson&rsquo;s request in a dispute raised by Stone, who has alleged Mueller violated a court order sealing the indictment by releasing it before the court had unsealed it on the docket in Stone&rsquo;s case. Mueller has pointed out that the sealing order allowed for the indictment to be unsealed after Stone was in custody.</p>\n<p>Mueller&rsquo;s investigative team received an email at 6:10 a.m. ET from FBI agents that Stone was in custody, according to Tuesday&rsquo;s filing.</p>\n<blockquote data-lang=\"en\"> <p>Here is the email the FBI sent Mueller&rsquo;s team at 6:10 am after arresting Stone, per Mueller&rsquo;s latest filing in the dispute over whether Stone&rsquo;s indictment was improperly published that morning <a href=\"https://t.co/Y39SXhU9Uq\">pic.twitter.com/Y39SXhU9Uq</a></p> <p>&mdash; Tierney Sneed (@Tierney_Megan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tierney_Megan/status/1100491354289909760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 26, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The special counsel&rsquo;s office updated its Justice Department website to add a copy of the indictment at 6:11:45 a.m., according to the filing, which included a log of the website edits. A spokesperson emailed the press with a link to the website and an announcement of Stone&rsquo;s arrest at 6:16 a.m., according to the filing. The email went out to 500 journalists from 127 news organizations &mdash; outlets that are listed in an exhibit of the filing.</p>\n<p>Stone was charged with making false statements, obstruction and witness tampering. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p>He has pushed a conspiracy theory that the media had been tipped off to his predawn Jan. 25 arrest, after CNN was present at his Florida home to document it. Former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/whitaker-concern-cnn-stone-arrest\">fanned</a> the flames at a congressional hearing this month where he said he shared a GOP lawmaker&rsquo;s &ldquo;concern with the possibility that a media outlet was tipped off.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>CNN has denied receiving any heads-up &mdash; the outlet has laid out all the subtle clues and observations that led it to believe Stone&rsquo;s arrest might be imminent &mdash; and Mueller&rsquo;s office<a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/mueller-denies-stone-cnn-indictment-advanced-warning\"> has also said</a> it was not aware of &ldquo;any advance knowledge&rdquo; being given to the media.</p>\n<p>Stone alluded to the conspiracy theory<a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/stone-request-cnn-mueller-conspiracy-theory\"> in his request </a>that Berman Jackson order a hearing on whether Mueller violated the sealing order. Berman Jackson has not ordered such a hearing, and instead had requested Mueller clarify &ldquo;the precise timing and content&rdquo; of its notice to the media that Stone had been indicted.</p>\n<p>Read the documents filed by Mueller below:</p>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/196vW0Hq7Q7YrcM97auRbUU2y8gbFyLPq/preview\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "Amid suggestions from Roger Stone and his allies that special counsel Robert Mueller inappropriately leaked the charges he brought against the operative, Mueller filed documents confirming that the grand jury indictment was publicly posted only after Stone had been arrested last month.\nThe documents were filed at U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson\u2019s request in a dispute raised by Stone, who has alleged Mueller violated a court order sealing the indictment by releasing it before the court had unsealed it on the docket in Stone\u2019s case. Mueller has pointed out that the sealing order allowed for the indictment to be unsealed after Stone was in custody.\nMueller\u2019s investigative team received an email at 6:10 a.m. ET from FBI agents that Stone was in custody, according to Tuesday\u2019s filing.\nHere is the email the FBI sent Mueller\u2019s team at 6:10 am after arresting Stone, per Mueller\u2019s latest filing in the dispute over whether Stone\u2019s indictment was improperly published that morning pic.twitter.com/Y39SXhU9Uq\n\u2014 Tierney Sneed (@Tierney_Megan) February 26, 2019\nThe special counsel\u2019s office updated its Justice Department website to add a copy of the indictment at 6:11:45 a.m., according to the filing, which included a log of the website edits. A spokesperson emailed the press with a link to the website and an announcement of Stone\u2019s arrest at 6:16 a.m., according to the filing. The email went out to 500 journalists from 127 news organizations \u2014 outlets that are listed in an exhibit of the filing.\nStone was charged with making false statements, obstruction and witness tampering. He has pleaded not guilty.\nHe has pushed a conspiracy theory that the media had been tipped off to his predawn Jan. 25 arrest, after CNN was present at his Florida home to document it. Former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker fanned the flames at a congressional hearing this month where he said he shared a GOP lawmaker\u2019s \u201cconcern with the possibility that a media outlet was tipped off.\u201d\nCNN has denied receiving any heads-up \u2014 the outlet has laid out all the subtle clues and observations that led it to believe Stone\u2019s arrest might be imminent \u2014 and Mueller\u2019s office has also said it was not aware of \u201cany advance knowledge\u201d being given to the media.\nStone alluded to the conspiracy theory in his request that Berman Jackson order a hearing on whether Mueller violated the sealing order. Berman Jackson has not ordered such a hearing, and instead had requested Mueller clarify \u201cthe precise timing and content\u201d of its notice to the media that Stone had been indicted.\nRead the documents filed by Mueller below:",

The gun lobby also appears to be probing whether a separate deal that AMc signed with NRA president Oliver North allowed the advertising firm to lay North&rsquo;s fees on the gun lobby that he runs.</p>\n<p>The filing itself reads at times as if it were written by a lovelorn Wayne LaPierre, recounting the NRA&rsquo;s 40-year relationship with the firm and how allegations of self-dealing that appear to revolve around Oliver North may have led it to ruin.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Together, the parties crafted iconic, impactful Second Amendment messaging that featured Charlton Heston (&ldquo;from my cold, dead hands&rdquo;) and other important constitutional rights advocates,&rdquo; the filing reads. &ldquo;The impasse between them which gives rise to this lawsuit is simple, and baffling: the NRA requested access to material, readily available records that Ackerman and Mercury are contractually obligated to provide. Defendants refused to provide them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The heart of the suit comes down to a 2017 contract that the NRA negotiated with AMc.</p>\n<p>The 2017 contract also established NRATV, which the gun rights lobbying group says AMc &ldquo;fervently pitched.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The agreement allegedly stipulated that the NRA would cover AMc&rsquo;s &ldquo;travel and related expenses,&rdquo; and that it would also pay AMc for third-party contractors hired to do work dedicated to the NRA, including a &ldquo;termination fee to cover severance payments&rdquo; if the agreement ended.</p>\n<p>The NRA says that it paid big money for AMc for the NRATV work. &ldquo;By 2017, the NRA&rsquo;s aggregate payments to Ackerman and Mercury totaled nearly $40 million annually,&rdquo; the filing reads.</p>\n<p>But as it turns out, the people who brought you the public relations response to Columbine may have gotten into trouble with the creation of the TV project.</p>\n<p>The NRA is concerned that AMc has been over-billing the gun rights group for the work of third-party contractors, the lawsuit said.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit also claims that &ldquo;certain NRA stakeholders were also concerned that NRATV&rsquo;s messaging &mdash; on topics far afield of the Second Amendment &mdash; deviated from the NRA&rsquo;s core mission and values.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The channel quickly took fever swamp-mongering to a new level, at one point a<a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/nra-tv-fisk-the-new-york-times\">iring a video</a> telling the New York Times &ldquo;we&rsquo;re coming for you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>By August 2018, the NRA had begun to review its financial ties with &ldquo;hundreds of vendors,&rdquo; including AMc. But the ad firm has allegedly refused to give the NRA a range of financial information, including documents surrounding the 2017 contract.</p>\n<p>That included budgets that the NRA &ldquo;purportedly approved,&rdquo; &ldquo;copies of material contracts for which the NRA is purportedly liable,&rdquo; and NRATV performance metrics.</p>\n<p>The gun rights lobby appears to have relied on a sort of honor system in its earlier deaings with AMc, auditing the firm each year but relying on &ldquo;samples assembled in advance by AMc.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>According to the suit, &ldquo;AMc&rsquo;s responses became evasive and hostile&rdquo; after the NRA asked for the documents. At one point, the NRA alleges, AMc demanded that its outside counsel supervise the NRA&rsquo;s document review, and then stipulated that the NRA pay the outside counsel&rsquo;s legal fees in exchange for giving the NRA video footage that it had already been invoiced for.</p>\n<p>In a statement to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/nra-files-suit-against-ad-agency-in-rift-with-key-partner-11555320601\">Wall Street Journal</a>, which first reported the existence of the litigation, AMc called the lawsuit &ldquo;frivolous, inaccurate and intended to cause harm to the reputation of our company,&rdquo; while a company representative purportedly said that an NRA-hired forensic accountant had received &ldquo;every single thing they requested.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At the same time as it was trying to access AMc&rsquo;s budgets, the NRA writes, it was also trying to get a copy of a third-party contract that its president, Iran-Contra participant Oliver North, purportedly signed with AMc.</p>\n<p>The NRA describes North&rsquo;s role in the group as &ldquo;a largely ceremonial but high-profile position famously occupied by Charlton Heston during the late 1990s,&rdquo; and writes that his contract with AMc could put the NRA in violation of a New York State law that stipulates that non-profit groups review any transaction that present potential financial conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>The NRA appears to have been aware that North was signing a separate deal with AMc and so in September 2018, the filing reads, an NRA audit committee reviewed a &ldquo;purported summary&rdquo; of North&rsquo;s contract with AMc. However, the NRATV manager allegedly refused to provide the NRA with a full copy of the contract.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the complaint reads, the NRA went through a six-month &ldquo;back-and-forth&rdquo; with AMc and North himself, during which North stated through a lawyer that &ldquo;he could only disclose a copy of the contract&rdquo; with AMc&rsquo;s permission.</p>\n<p>By February 2019, AMc apparently relented, and allowed the NRA&rsquo;s general counsel a &ldquo;circumscribed&rdquo; review of the North contract without providing him a copy, the document reads.</p>\n<p>That review purportedly raised questions over whether the summary of North&rsquo;s contract &ldquo;had been complete and accurate&rdquo; and whether North had separate fiduciary duties to AMc that &ldquo;supersede his duties to the NRA,&rdquo; and whether the contract prevented North from &ldquo;communicating fully and honestly with other NRA fiduciaries about AMc.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In late March, the NRA says that it sent a final demand to AMc for copies of other third-party contracts, a list of those AMc classified as working on the NRA account, and information about costs associated with North&rsquo;s contract. The NRA appears to be interested in finding out whether costs &ldquo;relating to AMc&rsquo;s engagement of Col. North&hellip;were being &lsquo;passed through&rsquo; to the NRA.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>AMc purportedly acknowledged receipt without sending the information.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The NRA is at the end of its rope,&rdquo; the filing reads. &ldquo;Its compliance with not-for-profit law cannot be permitted to be held hostage by a recalcitrant advertising agency.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "NRATV has allegedly told the National Rifle Association that it can take key financial information about the groups\u2019 relationship from its cold dead hands, according to a lawsuit the NRA filed on Friday.\nThe complaint \u2014 filed by the NRA in Virginia\u2019s Alexandria circuit court \u2014 demands that Oklahoma-based advertising firm and NRATV operator Ackerman McQueen hand over reams of documents that it has allegedly been withholding for months, saying that \u201cits patience has run out.\u201d\nThe NRA appears to be seeking the information in connection with an investigation into whether Ackerman and a related company called Mercury \u2014 referred to as AMc in the case \u2014 were over billing the gun lobby. The gun lobby also appears to be probing whether a separate deal that AMc signed with NRA president Oliver North allowed the advertising firm to lay North\u2019s fees on the gun lobby that he runs.\nThe filing itself reads at times as if it were written by a lovelorn Wayne LaPierre, recounting the NRA\u2019s 40-year relationship with the firm and how allegations of self-dealing that appear to revolve around Oliver North may have led it to ruin.\n\u201cTogether, the parties crafted iconic, impactful Second Amendment messaging that featured Charlton Heston (\u201cfrom my cold, dead hands\u201d) and other important constitutional rights advocates,\u201d the filing reads. \u201cThe impasse between them which gives rise to this lawsuit is simple, and baffling: the NRA requested access to material, readily available records that Ackerman and Mercury are contractually obligated to provide. Defendants refused to provide them.\u201d\nThe heart of the suit comes down to a 2017 contract that the NRA negotiated with AMc.\nThe 2017 contract also established NRATV, which the gun rights lobbying group says AMc \u201cfervently pitched.\u201d\nThe agreement allegedly stipulated that the NRA would cover AMc\u2019s \u201ctravel and related expenses,\u201d and that it would also pay AMc for third-party contractors hired to do work dedicated to the NRA, including a \u201ctermination fee to cover severance payments\u201d if the agreement ended.\nThe NRA says that it paid big money for AMc for the NRATV work. \u201cBy 2017, the NRA\u2019s aggregate payments to Ackerman and Mercury totaled nearly $40 million annually,\u201d the filing reads.\nBut as it turns out, the people who brought you the public relations response to Columbine may have gotten into trouble with the creation of the TV project.\nThe NRA is concerned that AMc has been over-billing the gun rights group for the work of third-party contractors, the lawsuit said.\nThe lawsuit also claims that \u201ccertain NRA stakeholders were also concerned that NRATV\u2019s messaging \u2014 on topics far afield of the Second Amendment \u2014 deviated from the NRA\u2019s core mission and values.\u201d\nThe channel quickly took fever swamp-mongering to a new level, at one point airing a video telling the New York Times \u201cwe\u2019re coming for you.\u201d\nBy August 2018, the NRA had begun to review its financial ties with \u201chundreds of vendors,\u201d including AMc. But the ad firm has allegedly refused to give the NRA a range of financial information, including documents surrounding the 2017 contract.\nThat included budgets that the NRA \u201cpurportedly approved,\u201d \u201ccopies of material contracts for which the NRA is purportedly liable,\u201d and NRATV performance metrics.\nThe gun rights lobby appears to have relied on a sort of honor system in its earlier deaings with AMc, auditing the firm each year but relying on \u201csamples assembled in advance by AMc.\u201d\nAccording to the suit, \u201cAMc\u2019s responses became evasive and hostile\u201d after the NRA asked for the documents. At one point, the NRA alleges, AMc demanded that its outside counsel supervise the NRA\u2019s document review, and then stipulated that the NRA pay the outside counsel\u2019s legal fees in exchange for giving the NRA video footage that it had already been invoiced for.\nIn a statement to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the existence of the litigation, AMc called the lawsuit \u201cfrivolous, inaccurate and intended to cause harm to the reputation of our company,\u201d while a company representative purportedly said that an NRA-hired forensic accountant had received \u201cevery single thing they requested.\u201d\nAt the same time as it was trying to access AMc\u2019s budgets, the NRA writes, it was also trying to get a copy of a third-party contract that its president, Iran-Contra participant Oliver North, purportedly signed with AMc.\nThe NRA describes North\u2019s role in the group as \u201ca largely ceremonial but high-profile position famously occupied by Charlton Heston during the late 1990s,\u201d and writes that his contract with AMc could put the NRA in violation of a New York State law that stipulates that non-profit groups review any transaction that present potential financial conflicts of interest.\nThe NRA appears to have been aware that North was signing a separate deal with AMc and so in September 2018, the filing reads, an NRA audit committee reviewed a \u201cpurported summary\u201d of North\u2019s contract with AMc. However, the NRATV manager allegedly refused to provide the NRA with a full copy of the contract.\nAt the same time, the complaint reads, the NRA went through a six-month \u201cback-and-forth\u201d with AMc and North himself, during which North stated through a lawyer that \u201che could only disclose a copy of the contract\u201d with AMc\u2019s permission.\nBy February 2019, AMc apparently relented, and allowed the NRA\u2019s general counsel a \u201ccircumscribed\u201d review of the North contract without providing him a copy, the document reads.\nThat review purportedly raised questions over whether the summary of North\u2019s contract \u201chad been complete and accurate\u201d and whether North had separate fiduciary duties to AMc that \u201csupersede his duties to the NRA,\u201d and whether the contract prevented North from \u201ccommunicating fully and honestly with other NRA fiduciaries about AMc.\u201d\nIn late March, the NRA says that it sent a final demand to AMc for copies of other third-party contracts, a list of those AMc classified as working on the NRA account, and information about costs associated with North\u2019s contract. The NRA appears to be interested in finding out whether costs \u201crelating to AMc\u2019s engagement of Col. North\u2026were being \u2018passed through\u2019 to the NRA.\u201d\nAMc purportedly acknowledged receipt without sending the information.\n\u201cThe NRA is at the end of its rope,\u201d the filing reads. \u201cIts compliance with not-for-profit law cannot be permitted to be held hostage by a recalcitrant advertising agency.\u201d",

(MIKE THEILER/AFP/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>NEW YORK (AP) &mdash; The apparent suspension of Jeanine Pirro is squeezing Fox News Channel in two directions.</p>\n<p>A prominent Muslim-American civil rights organization is calling for advertisers to boycott Fox News, while another group is petitioning to have the weekend host reinstated.</p>\n<p>Pirro wasn&rsquo;t on the air Saturday, a week after Fox publicly condemned her for comments questioning U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar&rsquo;s loyalty because she wears a Muslim head covering. Fox hasn&rsquo;t explained the former New York-area district attorney&rsquo;s absence, declining to comment on &ldquo;internal scheduling matters.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The network&rsquo;s schedule for the upcoming weekend lists another program in Pirro&rsquo;s time slot.</p>\n<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation&rsquo;s largest Muslim civil rights organization, this week said that advertisers should boycott Fox News until Pirro and prime-time host Tucker Carlson were fired. Carlson has been fighting back since being criticized last week for comments made on a radio show a decade ago and unearthed last week.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the lobbying group Act for America urged its members write to Fox News President Suzanne Scott to complain about Pirro&rsquo;s absence. In its online message, Act for America said that instead of rewarding its anchor for opening a much-needed debate, &ldquo;Fox News caved to pressure from the radical left.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Jeanine Pirro did nothing wrong,&rdquo; the group&rsquo;s leader, Brigitte Gabriel, said via tweet. &ldquo;People should be outraged.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Act for America has been listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for anti-Muslim rhetoric. Gabriel has tweeted in recent days that she considered SPLC a hate group.</p>\n<p>Act for America said more than 20,000 people have responded to its request to email Scott. Fox News had no comment on the campaign Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Act for America was echoing tweets by President Donald Trump last weekend. He had also proclaimed his support for Pirro and advocated for her reinstatement.</p>\n<p>Pirro has issued one statement through Fox, saying she did not call Omar un-American and that &ldquo;my intention was to ask a question and start a debate, but of course because one is Muslim does not mean you don&rsquo;t support the Constitution.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gabriel had appeared with Pirro last Friday on the online Fox Nation service, where the advocacy group leader referred to Omar and a colleague, Rep. Rashida Talib, as anti-Semitic, in a transcript provided by the liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America. Of the two representatives, Pirro said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s almost as though they think they&rsquo;re representing another country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gabriel also criticized Fox in the wake of its hiring Monday of former Democratic National Committee chief Donna Brazile as a political commentator.</p>\n<p>Between the suspension of Pirro and hiring of Brazile, &ldquo;if that doesn&rsquo;t show you the direction Fox News is headed I don&rsquo;t know what will,&rdquo; she tweeted.</p>",

                "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The apparent suspension of Jeanine Pirro is squeezing Fox News Channel in two directions.\nA prominent Muslim-American civil rights organization is calling for advertisers to boycott Fox News, while another group is petitioning to have the weekend host reinstated.\nPirro wasn\u2019t on the air Saturday, a week after Fox publicly condemned her for comments questioning U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar\u2019s loyalty because she wears a Muslim head covering. Fox hasn\u2019t explained the former New York-area district attorney\u2019s absence, declining to comment on \u201cinternal scheduling matters.\u201d\nThe network\u2019s schedule for the upcoming weekend lists another program in Pirro\u2019s time slot.\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation\u2019s largest Muslim civil rights organization, this week said that advertisers should boycott Fox News until Pirro and prime-time host Tucker Carlson were fired. Carlson has been fighting back since being criticized last week for comments made on a radio show a decade ago and unearthed last week.\nMeanwhile, the lobbying group Act for America urged its members write to Fox News President Suzanne Scott to complain about Pirro\u2019s absence. In its online message, Act for America said that instead of rewarding its anchor for opening a much-needed debate, \u201cFox News caved to pressure from the radical left.\u201d\n\u201cJeanine Pirro did nothing wrong,\u201d the group\u2019s leader, Brigitte Gabriel, said via tweet. \u201cPeople should be outraged.\u201d\nAct for America has been listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for anti-Muslim rhetoric. Gabriel has tweeted in recent days that she considered SPLC a hate group.\nAct for America said more than 20,000 people have responded to its request to email Scott. Fox News had no comment on the campaign Tuesday.\nAct for America was echoing tweets by President Donald Trump last weekend. He had also proclaimed his support for Pirro and advocated for her reinstatement.\nPirro has issued one statement through Fox, saying she did not call Omar un-American and that \u201cmy intention was to ask a question and start a debate, but of course because one is Muslim does not mean you don\u2019t support the Constitution.\u201d\nGabriel had appeared with Pirro last Friday on the online Fox Nation service, where the advocacy group leader referred to Omar and a colleague, Rep. Rashida Talib, as anti-Semitic, in a transcript provided by the liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America. Of the two representatives, Pirro said, \u201cit\u2019s almost as though they think they\u2019re representing another country.\u201d\nGabriel also criticized Fox in the wake of its hiring Monday of former Democratic National Committee chief Donna Brazile as a political commentator.\nBetween the suspension of Pirro and hiring of Brazile, \u201cif that doesn\u2019t show you the direction Fox News is headed I don\u2019t know what will,\u201d she tweeted.",

Devin Nunes (D-CA) in his legal crusade against Twitter\u2019s alleged bias against conservatives, said in a statement on Tuesday that she and Nunes don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on the First Amendment.\n\u201cI have very different views on the applicable law (including the First Amendment) than Rep. Nunes,\u201d she said in the statement posted to Twitter. \u201cI will say that as a libertarian Republican, I personally hold very dear the principles of the First Amendment. I also believe that every member of Congress, Rep. Nunes has sworn an oath to support and defend the U.S. Constitution, including the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment, and that as a public official, it is entirely proper and correct that his actions, political committee expenditures, voting record and conduct be subject to public scrutiny and debate.\u201d\nNunes is suing Twitter, Maier and two absurd parody accounts \u2014 @DevinNunesMom and @DevinCow \u2014 for $250 million, alleging a vast conspiracy to attack him on Twitter. He\u2019s using the suit to add fodder to a conservative conspiracy theory that social media accounts are out to get conservatives. President Trump even boosted the theory Tuesday.\nFor those looking for comment from me on #DevinNunes lawsuit, here you go.

Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to co...</figcaption></figure>\n<p>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) &mdash; A federal appeals court on Tuesday grilled lawyers for the state of Maryland and the District of Columbia about their claims that President Donald Trump is violating the Constitution by accepting profits through foreign and domestic officials who stay at his Washington hotel.</p>\n<p>A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court Appeals expressed skepticism about claims in a lawsuit that alleges Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits federal officials from accepting benefits from foreign or state governments without congressional approval.</p>\n<p>The judges repeatedly questioned lawyers for Maryland and the District about what they seek as a solution to their concerns about Trump&rsquo;s business interests.</p>\n<p>Judge Paul Niemeyer said Trump has pulled back from active management of the Trump International Hotel and questioned whether Trump divesting himself of the business would have any effect on whether dignitaries stay there, since it would likely remain in the Trump family.</p>\n<p>Loren AliKhan, solicitor general for the District of Columbia, said divestment would be one option to solve the problem.</p>\n<p>Judge Dennis Shedd pressed her about whether anything short of divestment would resolve concerns about Trump violating the emoluments clause.</p>\n<p>She said a declaration that Trump has violated the clause and an injunction ordering him not to do so could also be an option.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think you even want him fired from &ldquo;The Apprentice,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Shedd asked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; AliKhan replied.</p>\n<p>Shedd also seemed skeptical of the lawsuit&rsquo;s claim that Maryland and the District have suffered harm because more people would stay at their hotels if they weren&rsquo;t eager to curry favor with the president by staying at Trump&rsquo;s hotel. He said many people visit Washington to protest the Republican president&rsquo;s policies and would be more likely to stay at his competitors&rsquo; hotels.</p>\n<p>AliKhan said Trump&rsquo;s status as president is &ldquo;a driving factor&rdquo; for foreign and domestic government officials to stay at his hotel.</p>\n<p>Trump is challenging a ruling by a federal judge in Maryland to allow the lawsuit to proceed.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s legal team told the appeals court that Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine &mdash; both Democrats &mdash; lack authority to sue the president in his official capacity.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The president is unique in our constitutional structure,&rdquo; said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Hashim Mooppan.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s lawyers also argued that the emoluments clause only bars compensation made in connection with services provided in his official capacity or in &ldquo;an employment-type relationship&rdquo; with a foreign or domestic government.</p>\n<p>They say that even if Frosh and Racine did have standing to sue, their claims are invalid because the president has not violated the emoluments clause.</p>\n<p>Mooppan said the plaintiffs are arguing that they&rsquo;ve suffered injuries from competition when the emoluments clause was meant as a check against government corruption.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is no support for their broad definition,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>The 4th Circuit&rsquo;s decision to hear the unusual mid-case appeal put the lawsuit on hold before deadlines to respond to subpoenas issued in December seeking tax returns, receipts and other records from more than 30 entities, including 13 Trump businesses and the federal agency that oversees the lease for Trump&rsquo;s hotel.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department has argued that the discovery is &ldquo;intrusive&rdquo; and could distract Trump from performance of his constitutional duties.</p>\n<p>After the hearing, Racine and Frosh downplayed the judges&rsquo; aggressive questioning.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We think our case is a strong one and we expect to prevail,&rdquo; Frosh said.</p>\n<p>The 4th Circuit panel court did not indicate when it would rule. No matter how it rules, it appears likely the case will not end quickly.</p>\n<p>Racine said that if Maryland and the District lose the appeal before the three-judge panel, they would seriously consider asking for a rehearing by the full court. He said it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise him if the case ended up in the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>All three judges on the panel were nominated to the 4th Circuit by Republican presidents: Niemeyer, by George H.W. Bush; Shedd, by George W. Bush, and Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum, by Trump.</p>\n<p>Two other lawsuits accusing the president of violating the emoluments clause have been filed in other federal courts.</p>",

                "text": "RICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014 A federal appeals court on Tuesday grilled lawyers for the state of Maryland and the District of Columbia about their claims that President Donald Trump is violating the Constitution by accepting profits through foreign and domestic officials who stay at his Washington hotel.\nA three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court Appeals expressed skepticism about claims in a lawsuit that alleges Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits federal officials from accepting benefits from foreign or state governments without congressional approval.\nThe judges repeatedly questioned lawyers for Maryland and the District about what they seek as a solution to their concerns about Trump\u2019s business interests.\nJudge Paul Niemeyer said Trump has pulled back from active management of the Trump International Hotel and questioned whether Trump divesting himself of the business would have any effect on whether dignitaries stay there, since it would likely remain in the Trump family.\nLoren AliKhan, solicitor general for the District of Columbia, said divestment would be one option to solve the problem.\nJudge Dennis Shedd pressed her about whether anything short of divestment would resolve concerns about Trump violating the emoluments clause.\nShe said a declaration that Trump has violated the clause and an injunction ordering him not to do so could also be an option.\n\u201cI think you even want him fired from \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d don\u2019t you?\u201d Shedd asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d AliKhan replied.\nShedd also seemed skeptical of the lawsuit\u2019s claim that Maryland and the District have suffered harm because more people would stay at their hotels if they weren\u2019t eager to curry favor with the president by staying at Trump\u2019s hotel. He said many people visit Washington to protest the Republican president\u2019s policies and would be more likely to stay at his competitors\u2019 hotels.\nAliKhan said Trump\u2019s status as president is \u201ca driving factor\u201d for foreign and domestic government officials to stay at his hotel.\nTrump is challenging a ruling by a federal judge in Maryland to allow the lawsuit to proceed.\nTrump\u2019s legal team told the appeals court that Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine \u2014 both Democrats \u2014 lack authority to sue the president in his official capacity.\n\u201cThe president is unique in our constitutional structure,\u201d said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Hashim Mooppan.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers also argued that the emoluments clause only bars compensation made in connection with services provided in his official capacity or in \u201can employment-type relationship\u201d with a foreign or domestic government.\nThey say that even if Frosh and Racine did have standing to sue, their claims are invalid because the president has not violated the emoluments clause.\nMooppan said the plaintiffs are arguing that they\u2019ve suffered injuries from competition when the emoluments clause was meant as a check against government corruption.\n\u201cThere is no support for their broad definition,\u201d he said.\nThe 4th Circuit\u2019s decision to hear the unusual mid-case appeal put the lawsuit on hold before deadlines to respond to subpoenas issued in December seeking tax returns, receipts and other records from more than 30 entities, including 13 Trump businesses and the federal agency that oversees the lease for Trump\u2019s hotel.\nThe Justice Department has argued that the discovery is \u201cintrusive\u201d and could distract Trump from performance of his constitutional duties.\nAfter the hearing, Racine and Frosh downplayed the judges\u2019 aggressive questioning.\n\u201cWe think our case is a strong one and we expect to prevail,\u201d Frosh said.\nThe 4th Circuit panel court did not indicate when it would rule. No matter how it rules, it appears likely the case will not end quickly.\nRacine said that if Maryland and the District lose the appeal before the three-judge panel, they would seriously consider asking for a rehearing by the full court. He said it wouldn\u2019t surprise him if the case ended up in the U.S. Supreme Court.\nAll three judges on the panel were nominated to the 4th Circuit by Republican presidents: Niemeyer, by George H.W. Bush; Shedd, by George W. Bush, and Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum, by Trump.\nTwo other lawsuits accusing the president of violating the emoluments clause have been filed in other federal courts.",

Some 200 people attended, including representatives of states, tribes and the chemical industry and environmentalists. A handful of reporters from other media organizations were also allowed into the meeting room, which had several empty seats at the time.</p>\n<p>Then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt was set to speak at the event, which was listed on his public schedule and described as being open to the press on a federal daybook of events.</p>\n<p>Knickmeyer had called EPA&rsquo;s press office the day before and was told by Wilcox that it was invitation-only and there was no room for her. She said she showed up anyway, and was told by a security guard that she couldn&rsquo;t enter. She said she asked to speak to a representative from the press office, was refused and told to get out.</p>\n<p>After security told her &ldquo;we can make you get out,&rdquo; Knickmeyer said she took out her phone to record what was happening. The video shows a security guard grabbed her shoulders from behind and pushed her out the door.</p>\n<p>Part of the interaction is obscured by a metal detector at the entrance.</p>\n<p>At the time of the incident, AP Executive Editor Sally Buzbee said in a statement, &ldquo;The Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s selective barring of news organizations, including the AP, from covering today&rsquo;s meeting is alarming and a direct threat to the public&rsquo;s right to know about what is happening inside their government. It is particularly distressing that any journalist trying to cover an event in the public interest would be forcibly removed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Pruitt had a contentious relationship with the media. The agency sought to bar the AP and some other news organizations from some of Pruitt&rsquo;s events and publicly assailed a reporter for &ldquo;yellow journalism&rdquo; following AP reports from toxic waste sites that flooded during Hurricane Harvey.</p>\n<p>Pruitt resigned in July amid controversies, including outsized spending on his security detail and living in a bargain-priced Capitol Hill condo owned by an energy-industry lobbyist.</p>\n<p>Wilcox, a longtime Republican media operative, left EPA days after Pruitt&rsquo;s departure.</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Security camera footage released Tuesday undermines Trump administration claims that a reporter for The Associated Press tried to force her way into the Environmental Protection Agency headquarters to cover a summit last year on drinking water contaminants.\nVideo obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request shows a security guard grab AP reporter Ellen Knickmeyer by the shoulders on May 22 and shove her out of the agency\u2019s lobby.\nThen-EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox subsequently claimed Knickmeyer was removed after she \u201cproceeded to push through the security entrance,\u201d but after AP objected he revised his statement to say she refused to leave when requested.\nThe video does not show Knickmeyer physically resisting the guards or trying to push through the barrier.\nEPA officials later personally apologized to Knickmeyer for the agency\u2019s handling of the incident.\nEPA spokesman John Konkus said Tuesday that officials had \u201crelied on the security personnel to tell us what happened.\u201d\nAP, CNN and E&E News, which covers energy and environmental issues, were initially barred from attending what had been billed as a national summit on dangerous chemicals that have been found in some water systems. Some 200 people attended, including representatives of states, tribes and the chemical industry and environmentalists. A handful of reporters from other media organizations were also allowed into the meeting room, which had several empty seats at the time.\nThen-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt was set to speak at the event, which was listed on his public schedule and described as being open to the press on a federal daybook of events.\nKnickmeyer had called EPA\u2019s press office the day before and was told by Wilcox that it was invitation-only and there was no room for her. She said she showed up anyway, and was told by a security guard that she couldn\u2019t enter. She said she asked to speak to a representative from the press office, was refused and told to get out.\nAfter security told her \u201cwe can make you get out,\u201d Knickmeyer said she took out her phone to record what was happening. The video shows a security guard grabbed her shoulders from behind and pushed her out the door.\nPart of the interaction is obscured by a metal detector at the entrance.\nAt the time of the incident, AP Executive Editor Sally Buzbee said in a statement, \u201cThe Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s selective barring of news organizations, including the AP, from covering today\u2019s meeting is alarming and a direct threat to the public\u2019s right to know about what is happening inside their government. It is particularly distressing that any journalist trying to cover an event in the public interest would be forcibly removed.\u201d\nPruitt had a contentious relationship with the media. The agency sought to bar the AP and some other news organizations from some of Pruitt\u2019s events and publicly assailed a reporter for \u201cyellow journalism\u201d following AP reports from toxic waste sites that flooded during Hurricane Harvey.\nPruitt resigned in July amid controversies, including outsized spending on his security detail and living in a bargain-priced Capitol Hill condo owned by an energy-industry lobbyist.\nWilcox, a longtime Republican media operative, left EPA days after Pruitt\u2019s departure.",

The Public Lands Order withdraws 30,000 acres of public land from hard rock minin...</figcaption></figure>\n<p>BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) &mdash; Former U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is quickly parlaying his time in President Donald Trump&rsquo;s cabinet into a lucrative private career.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s landed a more than $100,000-a-year post at a Nevada mining company and is pursuing involvement in natural gas exports that have surged under Trump, Zinke told The Associated Press Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The rapid transition from the highest levels of the executive branch to the corporate boardroom is raising questions about possible conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>It comes fewer than four months after Zinke left a cabinet position overseeing the country&rsquo;s oil and gas, coal and other natural resources and those companies that profit off their extraction.</p>\n<p>Zinke told AP that his work for Nevada-based U.S. Gold Corp., which focuses on mining exploration and development, would not constitute lobbying. But the company&rsquo;s CEO cited Zinke&rsquo;s &ldquo;excellent relationship&rdquo; with the Bureau of Land Management and the Interior Department in explaining his hiring as a consultant and board member.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to have Secretary Zinke help move us forward&rdquo; on two pending mining projects, in Nevada and Wyoming, Edward Karr, head of U.S. Gold Corp., said by phone. The Nevada project, known as Keystone, is on bureau land.</p>\n<p>A 2017 executive order from Trump said executive-branch appointees cannot lobby their former agency for at least five years after leaving their government post.</p>\n<p>Separately, criminal statutes impose one and two-year bans on various kinds of communications between senior federal officials and their former agency, said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit ethics-watchdog.</p>\n<p>Zinke, who left Interior in January amid ethics allegations, said he sees no conflict in his new role and will have no direct contact with his former colleagues at the agency.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t lobby,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just follow the law, so I don&rsquo;t talk to anybody on the executive side or influence&rdquo; anyone.</p>\n<p>Zinke described the inside knowledge he gained at the helm of Interior as an asset as he moves into the corporate world.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I understand the process. There&rsquo;s very few former state senators, congressmen and secretaries that know more about the process than I do,&rdquo; said Zinke, who served in the Montana Legislature and the U.S. House before being appointed to lead Interior.</p>\n<p>The purpose of federal lobbying freezes by recently departed senior officials is &ldquo;to make sure there&rsquo;s a cooling-off period &hellip; so the former agency is not subject to the influence of their former head,&rdquo; Canter said.</p>\n<p>Given the restrictions, she said Karr&rsquo;s comment on Zinke&rsquo;s good relationship with Interior &ldquo;just raises questions about what he meant.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Zinke previously took two other jobs since leaving Interior: a consultant for Artillery One, a North Carolina-based private investment company, and an adviser to the Washington lobbying firm Turnberry Solutions.</p>\n<p>At U.S. Gold, Zinke will receive a total of $114,000 a year in cash and stock as a board member and under a one-year consulting contract, Karr said. He will also receive up to $120,000 a year in expenses, according to a company filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n<p>Zinke has a degree in geology from the University of Oregon. He never worked professionally in the field, instead becoming a U.S. Navy SEAL. But he said his education and political involvement in Montana mining projects would be useful at his new company.</p>\n<p>Regarding natural gas exports, Zinke described his interest in the industry only broadly and declined to disclose any company or entities he&rsquo;s working with.</p>\n<p>Demand for the fuel has surged in the past two years, driven in part by rising consumption in China and South Korea. Meanwhile, domestic markets are being saturated by the huge amounts of fuel coming out of the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, Zinke said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re looking at overseas markets for LNG (liquefied natural gas),&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With LNG, it&rsquo;s better to ship products made in America with our environmental regulations than watching it get produced overseas with none.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He added that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;involved in some wind (energy) as well. I think the energy piece, made in America, is important.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As Interior secretary, Zinke in 2018 floated the prospect of using U.S. military bases or other government installations on the West Coast to facilitate the export of coal and natural gas to Asia.</p>\n<p>The idea was denounced by Democrats and environmentalists and never appeared to gain much traction within the administration. It&rsquo;s uncertain if it&rsquo;s still alive.</p>\n<p>During Zinke&rsquo;s time at Interior, the agency&rsquo;s inspector general investigated his decision to stop a major study into the health effects of coal mining, as well as his travel and other issues.</p>",

                "text": "BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Former U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is quickly parlaying his time in President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet into a lucrative private career.\nHe\u2019s landed a more than $100,000-a-year post at a Nevada mining company and is pursuing involvement in natural gas exports that have surged under Trump, Zinke told The Associated Press Tuesday.\nThe rapid transition from the highest levels of the executive branch to the corporate boardroom is raising questions about possible conflicts of interest.\nIt comes fewer than four months after Zinke left a cabinet position overseeing the country\u2019s oil and gas, coal and other natural resources and those companies that profit off their extraction.\nZinke told AP that his work for Nevada-based U.S. Gold Corp., which focuses on mining exploration and development, would not constitute lobbying. But the company\u2019s CEO cited Zinke\u2019s \u201cexcellent relationship\u201d with the Bureau of Land Management and the Interior Department in explaining his hiring as a consultant and board member.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to have Secretary Zinke help move us forward\u201d on two pending mining projects, in Nevada and Wyoming, Edward Karr, head of U.S. Gold Corp., said by phone. The Nevada project, known as Keystone, is on bureau land.\nA 2017 executive order from Trump said executive-branch appointees cannot lobby their former agency for at least five years after leaving their government post.\nSeparately, criminal statutes impose one and two-year bans on various kinds of communications between senior federal officials and their former agency, said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit ethics-watchdog.\nZinke, who left Interior in January amid ethics allegations, said he sees no conflict in his new role and will have no direct contact with his former colleagues at the agency.\n\u201cI don\u2019t lobby,\u201d he said. \u201cI just follow the law, so I don\u2019t talk to anybody on the executive side or influence\u201d anyone.\nZinke described the inside knowledge he gained at the helm of Interior as an asset as he moves into the corporate world.\n\u201cI understand the process. There\u2019s very few former state senators, congressmen and secretaries that know more about the process than I do,\u201d said Zinke, who served in the Montana Legislature and the U.S. House before being appointed to lead Interior.\nThe purpose of federal lobbying freezes by recently departed senior officials is \u201cto make sure there\u2019s a cooling-off period \u2026 so the former agency is not subject to the influence of their former head,\u201d Canter said.\nGiven the restrictions, she said Karr\u2019s comment on Zinke\u2019s good relationship with Interior \u201cjust raises questions about what he meant.\u201d\nZinke previously took two other jobs since leaving Interior: a consultant for Artillery One, a North Carolina-based private investment company, and an adviser to the Washington lobbying firm Turnberry Solutions.\nAt U.S. Gold, Zinke will receive a total of $114,000 a year in cash and stock as a board member and under a one-year consulting contract, Karr said. He will also receive up to $120,000 a year in expenses, according to a company filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nZinke has a degree in geology from the University of Oregon. He never worked professionally in the field, instead becoming a U.S. Navy SEAL. But he said his education and political involvement in Montana mining projects would be useful at his new company.\nRegarding natural gas exports, Zinke described his interest in the industry only broadly and declined to disclose any company or entities he\u2019s working with.\nDemand for the fuel has surged in the past two years, driven in part by rising consumption in China and South Korea. Meanwhile, domestic markets are being saturated by the huge amounts of fuel coming out of the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, Zinke said.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re looking at overseas markets for LNG (liquefied natural gas),\u201d he said. \u201cWith LNG, it\u2019s better to ship products made in America with our environmental regulations than watching it get produced overseas with none.\u201d\nHe added that he\u2019s \u201cinvolved in some wind (energy) as well. I think the energy piece, made in America, is important.\u201d\nAs Interior secretary, Zinke in 2018 floated the prospect of using U.S. military bases or other government installations on the West Coast to facilitate the export of coal and natural gas to Asia.\nThe idea was denounced by Democrats and environmentalists and never appeared to gain much traction within the administration. It\u2019s uncertain if it\u2019s still alive.\nDuring Zinke\u2019s time at Interior, the agency\u2019s inspector general investigated his decision to stop a major study into the health effects of coal mining, as well as his travel and other issues.",

Black activism has shaped the liberties that Asian Americans, South Asians, Southeast Asians, and Pacific Islanders (APIs) enjoy today -- from our ability to immigrate to the United States to modeling effective organizing strategies.</p>\n<p>It is crucial for us to recognize the Black activists who do this work and heed their call to solidarity. But as non-Black APIs, what does solidarity look like? To address this question, we must grapple with the reality of anti-Blackness in our communities.</p>\n<p>In Asian and Pacific Islander communities, anti-Blackness often manifests itself in two ways. The first way relates to the &ldquo;model minority&rdquo; myth. Through the glorification of whiteness and allyship with white people in our communities, anti-Blackness is perpetuated. For example, when our families support <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/tags/peter-liang/\">cops like Peter Liang</a> that uphold white supremacy and murder Black people, they are displaying the debasement and denial of Black humanity. The second way is through the appropriation and co-opting of Blackness. This is the robbery of Black people&rsquo;s culture and work. The use of the <em>n</em> word and the lack of acknowledgement of Black people and Black struggle, are all examples. There is so much work that we can do in API communities to keep each other accountable.</p>\n<p>We are members of the Youth Working Committee of the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance ( NQAPIA). We recently facilitated workshops about this topic at NQAPIA&rsquo;s National Growing Home Conference in 2018 and the National LGBTQ Task Force&rsquo;s Creating Change Conference in 2019. The sessions went well. As attendees reflected on anti-Blackness, we felt the gravity, seriousness, difficulty, and necessity of the conversations that were unfolding. We witnessed their anger and frustration when they learned about Peter Liang brutally murdering Akai Gurley, Rich Brian grossly co-opting trap music, and Asian-Americans in New York City opposing affirmative action. Yet this anger and frustration can turn into actionable and intentional solidarity.</p>\n<p>As we watched and heard of the killings of unarmed Black men and boys at the hands of the police, we also reflected on our own experiences with the police. We recognized that, while anti-Asian and anti-Black police misconduct and brutality have led us to shared struggle and common cause, the two are not the same. Anti-Black racism was the foundation that created the carceral police state. We must support Black Lives Matter and that we must show up in solidarity to combat police brutality. API activists created #<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gorrtv1bw70&feature=youtu.be\">QAPIs4BlackLives</a> and <a href=\"https://a4bl.wordpress.com/\">#Asians4BlackLives</a> so our community could support local Black organizing.</p>\n<p>We must confront anti-Blackness in all settings. Addressing anti-Blackness in interpersonal settings is only the first step. As non-Black API people, we can be in solidarity with Black folks by addressing the grievances delivered unto them by the state. We can call for the abolition of unfair imprisonment and the accountability of renegade racist cops, advocate for reparations, show up for Black liberation, fight for Black undocumented immigrants and refugees, support Black owned businesses, and more.</p>\n<p>Black people are not responsible for solving anti-Blackness alone&mdash; we must do the work ourselves while learning from Black writers, journalists, and activists already speaking out on these issues. As non-Black Asians and Pacific Islanders, we must ensure that we keep each other accountable, align ourselves with the Black community, and actively work in solidarity with the movement for Black liberation.</p>\n<p><em>THOMAS CHUNG (he/they) and KAI SONG (xie/xyr/xem) are leading the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance (<a href=\"http://www.nqapia.org/wpp/\">NQAPIA</a>)&rsquo;s Youth Working Group and have presented workshops addressing anti-blackness in Asian and Pacific Islander communities.</em></p>",

                "text": "As we close Black Hxstory Month, a common time to celebrate and uplift Black people and their historical contributions, it is imperative for all of us to see this time as a call for solidarity. Black activism has shaped the liberties that Asian Americans, South Asians, Southeast Asians, and Pacific Islanders (APIs) enjoy today -- from our ability to immigrate to the United States to modeling effective organizing strategies.\nIt is crucial for us to recognize the Black activists who do this work and heed their call to solidarity. But as non-Black APIs, what does solidarity look like? To address this question, we must grapple with the reality of anti-Blackness in our communities.\nIn Asian and Pacific Islander communities, anti-Blackness often manifests itself in two ways. The first way relates to the \u201cmodel minority\u201d myth. Through the glorification of whiteness and allyship with white people in our communities, anti-Blackness is perpetuated. For example, when our families support cops like Peter Liang that uphold white supremacy and murder Black people, they are displaying the debasement and denial of Black humanity. The second way is through the appropriation and co-opting of Blackness. This is the robbery of Black people\u2019s culture and work. The use of the n word and the lack of acknowledgement of Black people and Black struggle, are all examples. There is so much work that we can do in API communities to keep each other accountable.\nWe are members of the Youth Working Committee of the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance ( NQAPIA). We recently facilitated workshops about this topic at NQAPIA\u2019s National Growing Home Conference in 2018 and the National LGBTQ Task Force\u2019s Creating Change Conference in 2019. The sessions went well. As attendees reflected on anti-Blackness, we felt the gravity, seriousness, difficulty, and necessity of the conversations that were unfolding. We witnessed their anger and frustration when they learned about Peter Liang brutally murdering Akai Gurley, Rich Brian grossly co-opting trap music, and Asian-Americans in New York City opposing affirmative action. Yet this anger and frustration can turn into actionable and intentional solidarity.\nAs we watched and heard of the killings of unarmed Black men and boys at the hands of the police, we also reflected on our own experiences with the police. We recognized that, while anti-Asian and anti-Black police misconduct and brutality have led us to shared struggle and common cause, the two are not the same. Anti-Black racism was the foundation that created the carceral police state. We must support Black Lives Matter and that we must show up in solidarity to combat police brutality. API activists created #QAPIs4BlackLives and #Asians4BlackLives so our community could support local Black organizing.\nWe must confront anti-Blackness in all settings. Addressing anti-Blackness in interpersonal settings is only the first step. As non-Black API people, we can be in solidarity with Black folks by addressing the grievances delivered unto them by the state. We can call for the abolition of unfair imprisonment and the accountability of renegade racist cops, advocate for reparations, show up for Black liberation, fight for Black undocumented immigrants and refugees, support Black owned businesses, and more.\nBlack people are not responsible for solving anti-Blackness alone\u2014 we must do the work ourselves while learning from Black writers, journalists, and activists already speaking out on these issues. As non-Black Asians and Pacific Islanders, we must ensure that we keep each other accountable, align ourselves with the Black community, and actively work in solidarity with the movement for Black liberation.\nTHOMAS CHUNG (he/they) and KAI SONG (xie/xyr/xem) are leading the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance (NQAPIA)\u2019s Youth Working Group and have presented workshops addressing anti-blackness in Asian and Pacific Islander communities.",

I felt like it would be a good space. &hellip; I just didn&rsquo;t know the festival itself didn&rsquo;t have policies that were inclusive.

Navi emailed Coachella staff but never received a response, prompting her to reach out to attorneys.</p>\n<p>Now the American Civil Liberties Union and the siblings' attorney have sent a letter to AEG, the owner of Coachella, demanding an inclusive restroom policy that allows people to use the restrooms that correspond with their gender identity; they also want training for Coachella staff.</p>\n<p>Coachella's producers responded to the <em>Times</em> by calling the siblings' experience &quot;unacceptable&quot; and saying their treatment is not reflective of the &quot;inclusive festival culture that we strive for, and this behavior is intolerable.&quot;</p>\n<p>The stance of Coachella is complicated by its parent company and its owner, Philip Anschutz. The billionaire developer is not only a massive Republican donor but has given numerous contributions to anti-LGBTQ organizations, including at least two labeled hate groups.</p>\n<p>Anschutz <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2017/01/05/coachellas-republican-lgbtq-hate-groups\">donated $190,000</a> to groups including the Alliance Defending Freedom, National Christian Foundation, and Family Research Council. The Family Research Council has been designated an extremist hate group by the progressive Southern Poverty Law Center. The Alliance Defending Freedom, also designated a hate group, has been involved in promoting &quot;religious freedom&quot; to justify anti-LGBT discrimination, <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/20160211/religious-liberty-and-anti-lgbt-right#adf\">reports the SPLC</a>. It represented an antigay baker in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, which went to the Supreme Court. The National Christian Foundation funds groups that are &quot;aggressively working to chip away at the equal rights of LGBT Americans,&quot; according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/07/07/here-they-are-the-enemies-of-equality-for-lgbt-americans/?utm_term=.a98d9a853f1f\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>. During the 2016 election campaign, Anschutz and his wife gave a combined $1,012,000 to Republican candidates and political action committees, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2017/01/05/coachellas-republican-lgbtq-hate-groups\">The Fader</a></em>. The AEG owner also <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2017/01/05/coachellas-republican-lgbtq-hate-groups\">gave $500,000 to the Senate Leadership Fund, </a>a Republican super PAC that spent $83 million to fund campaigns against Democrats in the 2016 election. Anschutz also gave $2,000 to Mike Pence, a rabid homophobe and now the vice president, in his campaign for reelection to Congress in 2006.</p>\n<p>After the donations came to light in 2017, Anschutz <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/politics/2017/1/05/coachella-owner-denies-homophobia-festival-performer-vows-lgbt-donation\">called the reports &quot;fake news&quot;</a> and said he wouldn't have given to the groups if he knew they were anti-LGBTQ. Anschutz <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/music/2018/3/23/it-still-okay-go-coachella\">donated $1 million</a> to the Elton John AIDS Foundation last year.</p>",

Navi emailed Coachella staff but never received a response, prompting her to reach out to attorneys.\nNow the American Civil Liberties Union and the siblings' attorney have sent a letter to AEG, the owner of Coachella, demanding an inclusive restroom policy that allows people to use the restrooms that correspond with their gender identity; they also want training for Coachella staff.\nCoachella's producers responded to the Times by calling the siblings' experience \"unacceptable\" and saying their treatment is not reflective of the \"inclusive festival culture that we strive for, and this behavior is intolerable.\"\nThe stance of Coachella is complicated by its parent company and its owner, Philip Anschutz. The billionaire developer is not only a massive Republican donor but has given numerous contributions to anti-LGBTQ organizations, including at least two labeled hate groups.\nAnschutz donated $190,000 to groups including the Alliance Defending Freedom, National Christian Foundation, and Family Research Council. The Family Research Council has been designated an extremist hate group by the progressive Southern Poverty Law Center. The Alliance Defending Freedom, also designated a hate group, has been involved in promoting \"religious freedom\" to justify anti-LGBT discrimination, reports the SPLC. It represented an antigay baker in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, which went to the Supreme Court. The National Christian Foundation funds groups that are \"aggressively working to chip away at the equal rights of LGBT Americans,\" according to The Washington Post. During the 2016 election campaign, Anschutz and his wife gave a combined $1,012,000 to Republican candidates and political action committees, reports The Fader. The AEG owner also gave $500,000 to the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC that spent $83 million to fund campaigns against Democrats in the 2016 election. Anschutz also gave $2,000 to Mike Pence, a rabid homophobe and now the vice president, in his campaign for reelection to Congress in 2006.\nAfter the donations came to light in 2017, Anschutz called the reports \"fake news\" and said he wouldn't have given to the groups if he knew they were anti-LGBTQ. Anschutz donated $1 million to the Elton John AIDS Foundation last year.",

He grabbed her hand and prepared to kiss her; she turned her head, so his lips hit the side of her mouth. It was &ldquo;super-creepy and inappropriate,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I immediately felt violated because I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it or wanting it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can still see his lips coming straight for my face.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She filed suit Monday in federal court and Florida, &ldquo;seeking unspecified damages for emotional pain and suffering,&rdquo; the <em>Post </em>reports. Johnson, who is black, also contends in the suit that the Trump campaign discriminated against her by paying her less than white men in similar jobs.</p>\n<p>She said she came to consider the kiss to be part of a pattern of misconduct on Trump&rsquo;s part after the infamous <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/election/2016/10/07/lgbt-twitter-sounds-trumps-leaked-misogynistic-conversation\"><em>Access Hollywood</em> tape surfaced</a> in October 2016, with Trump bragging about grabbing women by the genitals without their consent. It took some time for her to decide on a lawyer to handle her case, she told the <em>Post.</em></p>\n<p>She named some eyewitnesses to the kissing incident, but they said they did not see it happen. &ldquo;Do I recall seeing anything inappropriate? One hundred percent no,&rdquo; former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Republican known for her <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/politicians/2016/9/13/8-lowest-points-pam-bondis-sad-career\">opposition to marriage equality,</a> told the <em>Post.</em> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a prosecutor, and if I saw something inappropriate, I would have said something.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Karen Giorno, who was Trump&rsquo;s Florida campaign director, said Johnson&rsquo;s accusation was &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; and that the incident &ldquo;absolutely did not happen.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, gave the <em>Post </em>a written statement saying the allegation was &ldquo;absurd on its face,&rdquo; further noting, &ldquo;This never happened and is directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eye witness accounts.&rdquo; Stephanie Grisham, who was the campaign&rsquo;s press director in 2016 and is now press secretary to First Lady Melania Trump, said she was present at the time and did not see the kiss.</p>\n<p>Johnson said she tried to get over the incident and even applied for jobs in the Trump administration but was not hired. That had nothing to do with her decision to file the suit, though, she told the <em>Post.</em> A former Democrat, she added that she opposes some of the administration&rsquo;s policies, such as the separation of immigrant families, and this did influence her. &ldquo;Babies in cages &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t think it was going to be this bad,&rdquo; she said. She was also influenced by the #MeToo movement, with survivors of sexual assault and harassment speaking out.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While more than a dozen other women <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/election/2016/10/13/8-trump-accusers-and-their-disturbing-stories-updated?pg=2&TB_iframe=true&width=600&caption=Advocate.com&keepThis=true&height=650\">have publicly accused</a> Trump of touching them in some inappropriate way, Johnson is the only accuser to come forward since he took office and the only one to allege unwanted contact during the campaign,&rdquo; the <em>Post </em>notes.

A former Democrat, she added that she opposes some of the administration\u2019s policies, such as the separation of immigrant families, and this did influence her. \u201cBabies in cages \u2014 I didn\u2019t think it was going to be this bad,\u201d she said. She was also influenced by the #MeToo movement, with survivors of sexual assault and harassment speaking out.\n\u201cWhile more than a dozen other women have publicly accused Trump of touching them in some inappropriate way, Johnson is the only accuser to come forward since he took office and the only one to allege unwanted contact during the campaign,\u201d the Post notes. Summer Zervos, who was a contestant on Trump\u2019s TV show The Apprentice, has sued him for defamation because he said she was lying in accusing him of kissing and groping her without her consent.",

She was one of four federal judges in four separate cases to issue injunctions keeping the ban from going into effect while lawsuits against it proceed through the courts.</p>\n<p><a data-islink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2019/3/19/link\"><figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/43c005f4-bdb3-449b-88be-def221fda4cd/1.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=309&width=550\"></img></figure><figure><video></video></figure></a></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2019/1/22/trans-military-ban-advanced-5-cis-straight-male-justices\">struck down two of the injunctions</a> in January, and a federal judge in Maryland vacated a third one earlier this month. But lawyers representing the transgender troops and others challenging the ban contended that Kollar-Kotelly&rsquo;s injunction was still valid. A three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals had <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/military/2019/1/04/appeals-court-gives-trump-first-win-trans-military-ban\">reversed it in early January,</a> but that court has not issued its final order, and the challengers have not had a chance to appeal the ruling to the full court. Kollar-Kotelly agreed that these factors mean her injunction stands.</p>\n<p>The three judges ruling for D.C.

                "text": "UPDATE (March 26): A Washington, D.C., federal court has released a new order that puts the trans military ban back in motion. According to the court filing, the motion allows for the issuance of the policy to begin in April.\nThis ban will impact over 13,700 soldiers in the United States military.\nBelow is background on the most recent halt the ban experienced. Elected officials plan to introduce new legislation in Congress later this week in last-ditch effort to stop the ban.\nThis is developing news...\n***\nA federal judge has thrown a wrench into the Trump administration\u2019s plan to implement its ban on transgender people in the military, saying her injunction against the ban still stands.\nJudge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia released a notice today asserting that her injunction of October 2017 remains in place. She was one of four federal judges in four separate cases to issue injunctions keeping the ban from going into effect while lawsuits against it proceed through the courts.\nThe Supreme Court struck down two of the injunctions in January, and a federal judge in Maryland vacated a third one earlier this month. But lawyers representing the transgender troops and others challenging the ban contended that Kollar-Kotelly\u2019s injunction was still valid. A three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed it in early January, but that court has not issued its final order, and the challengers have not had a chance to appeal the ruling to the full court. Kollar-Kotelly agreed that these factors mean her injunction stands.\nThe three judges ruling for D.C. Circuit, she wrote, did not issue their written opinions until March 8, and they gave the plaintiffs \u2014 the trans troops \u2014 21 days after that date to seek an appeal from the full circuit. \u201cAs of this date, Plaintiffs\u2019 time has not expired,\u201d she wrote. As such, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s mandate vacating this Court\u2019s preliminary injunction has not issued, and the mandate will not issue until March 29, 2019, at the earliest. \u2026 Lacking a mandate, Defendants remain bound by this Court\u2019s preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo.\u201d\nDonald Trump\u2019s administration had filed a legal brief March 9 claiming no impediment remained to implementing the ban. It followed this up March 12 with a memorandum saying that within 30 days, the military will discharge or deny enlistment to anyone who won\u2019t serve in the gender to which they were assigned at birth, or who are undergoing hormone therapy or other gender-confirmation procedures.\nLawyers for the trans troops hailed Kollar-Kotelly\u2019s ruling. GLBTQ Advocates and Defenders and the National Center for Lesbian Rights are representing the current and aspiring military members in the suit before her, Doe v. Trump.\n\u201cThe Trump administration cannot circumvent the judicial process just to fast track its baseless, unfair ban on transgender service members,\u201d said GLAD Transgender Rights Project director Jennifer Levi in a press release. \u201cThe dedicated transgender troops who show up every day to do their duty and serve their country deserve justice, and that includes requiring this administration to follow the ordinary rules of judicial process.\u201d\nNCLR legal director Shannon Minter added, \u201cJudge Kollar-Kotelly\u2019s ruling today makes crystal clear that her order enjoining the ban from going into effect remains in place. As a result, the government may not take any steps to institute a ban on transgender troops.\u201d\nThe Advocate has sought comment from the White House but has received no response yet.\nThis story is developing.
