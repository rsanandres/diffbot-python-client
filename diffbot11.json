There were no details and it\u2019s unclear whether the accord would include a binding commitment from China with repercussions for failure to comply.

It stepped up dramatically this week when Indian jets bombed what Delhi said was a terrorist training camp on the Pakistani side. India claimed to have killed 300 people in the strikes.\nThese are the first aerial attacks to occur across the \u201cLine of Control\u201d that splits Kashmir since 1971, at which time the countries were at war. The two countries, which both have nuclear weapons, have fought several times over Kashmir.\n\u201cHistory tells us that wars are full of miscalculation. My question is that given the weapons we have can we afford miscalculation,\u201d said Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan in a Wednesday broadcast. \u201cWe should sit down and talk.\u201d\nFollowing the latest skirmish, Indian airlines canceled flights to cities in the north of India, due to airspace restrictions.\nHowever, later in the day, an official from India\u2019s civil aviation regulator said flights to north Indian airports could immediately resume. Pakistan is at the time of writing still maintaining a ban on aircraft entering from Delhi at an altitude of below 32,000 feet\u2014that ban has led Air India to reroute flights taking off from Delhi that would have passed over Pakistan.\nThe situation has led some investors to turn to safer havens, with the Japanese yen and Swiss franc both strengthening in the wake of Pakistan\u2019s downing of the Indian aircraft. Pakistan\u2019s KSE 100 index fell by as much as 1,500 points Wednesday, while India\u2019s BSE Sensex index also fell 600 points.",

So far, assessing the North&rsquo;s capabilities has been educated guesswork. Total disclosure would back up the Trump administration&rsquo;s contention that Kim is genuinely ready to give up his weapons.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, some experts would take limits on enriching uranium or plutonium. They also want to see North Korea allow inspectors into the country so any commitment it makes can be verified.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m definitely interested in constructive action that limits or stops the amount of fissile material that North Korea can produce,&rdquo; said Melissa Hanham, a director at the One Earth Future Foundation. &ldquo;But this will just be a piece of paper unless it&rsquo;s implemented, and I don&rsquo;t think a handshake will carry it through.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>Defining &lsquo;Denuclearization&rsquo;</h3>\n<p>Even if North Korea makes no such promises, many experts would be happy if Trump and Kim agreed on the definition for that mouthful of a term &mdash; &ldquo;denuclearization&rdquo; &mdash; at the center of decades of tension between the two countries.</p>\n<p>The U.S. says denuclearization means North Korea agrees to gives up its nuclear weapons program. North Korea argues that the term should include U.S. action too &mdash; such as removing strategic bombers from Guam, and no longer including South Korea under its nuclear umbrella in Asia.</p>\n<p>Having a shared understanding of what denuclearization means could at least offer reassurances that the U.S. and North Korea are debating the same thing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s going to take us four or five meetings just to close the gap in terms of how we define denuclearization, then the process really isn&rsquo;t a process,&rdquo; Victor Cha, a former U.S. National Security Council official who is now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told reporters last week.</p>\n<h3>Setting Deadlines</h3>\n<p>Putting commitments down on paper is one thing. Forcing the two sides meet deadlines for those promises is another.</p>\n<p>The U.S. position on how quickly negotiations with North Korea should advance has varied wildly. Kim himself has never said how long he expects the talks to extend. After the first summit, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said denuclearization should be wrapped up by the end of Trump&rsquo;s first term. Trump has said that as long as Kim abstains from weapons tests, he doesn&rsquo;t care how long the process takes.</p>\n<p>North Korea will almost certainly seek to exploit that ambiguity and push for the process to drag on. That way, support for the U.S. campaign to isolate the country steadily weakens. But setting markers for working-level negotiations would help propel talks forward, according to Robert Carlin, a former CIA and State Department intelligence analyst who took part in negotiations with North Korea under President Bill Clinton&rsquo;s administration.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Most important is that the document lays out what should be happening over the next four to six months in terms of detailed negotiations so that the working level has instructions from on high,&rdquo; Carlin said. &ldquo;If things get snagged, each side can pull out the paper and say, &lsquo;Look, here&rsquo;s what your leader agreed to.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>\n<h3>Peace Declaration</h3>\n<p>There is intense speculation that the two sides will sign a declaration agreeing to end the Korean War, and establish &ldquo;liaison offices&rdquo; &mdash; a partial diplomatic presence &mdash; within each other&rsquo;s borders.</p>\n<p>But those ideas are accompanied with anxiety that Trump will win nothing in exchange for a peace declaration &mdash; or might even commit to withdraw some of the 30,000 American soldiers in South Korea. Experts generally agree that Kim would see a peace declaration as an achievement to bring home to his own people and tout as a major success &mdash; particularly if he gets it without any major concessions to Trump.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Officially saying that they are not at war anymore is probably fine but on the other hand the bargain hunter in me knows how badly North Korea wants that,&rdquo; said Hanham, of the One Earth Future Foundation. &ldquo;I do think the U.S. should extract something for it.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://www.dianomi.com/smartads.epl?id=4953\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "After their first meeting a year ago, President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a 400-word statement long on goodwill and short on detail. Trump will need more than that this time to credibly claim a success.\nAt the two-day summit in Hanoi, experts are looking for specific commitments from North Korea toward halting its nuclear program, with deadlines and procedures to verify that Kim does what he says. Trump meanwhile must avoid giving up anything too valuable in return.\n\u201cA fair marker is that the North Koreans have to put something on the table that they genuinely have not put on the table before and deliver on that,\u201d said James Carafano, the director of foreign policy studies at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic to think this is going to deliver some complete process and we\u2019re done here.\u201d\nFor his part, Trump dismissed the speculation on Wednesday.\nBelow are some guidelines to help gauge whether the summit meets expectations.\nNuclear Inventory\nAt the top of the wish list for Trump\u2019s supporters and detractors alike \u2014 absent a North Korean promise to give up its nuclear weapons entirely \u2014 is a declaration that reveals all of the country\u2019s nuclear stockpiles. So far, assessing the North\u2019s capabilities has been educated guesswork. Total disclosure would back up the Trump administration\u2019s contention that Kim is genuinely ready to give up his weapons.\nBeyond that, some experts would take limits on enriching uranium or plutonium. They also want to see North Korea allow inspectors into the country so any commitment it makes can be verified.\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely interested in constructive action that limits or stops the amount of fissile material that North Korea can produce,\u201d said Melissa Hanham, a director at the One Earth Future Foundation. \u201cBut this will just be a piece of paper unless it\u2019s implemented, and I don\u2019t think a handshake will carry it through.\u201d\nDefining \u2018Denuclearization\u2019\nEven if North Korea makes no such promises, many experts would be happy if Trump and Kim agreed on the definition for that mouthful of a term \u2014 \u201cdenuclearization\u201d \u2014 at the center of decades of tension between the two countries.\nThe U.S. says denuclearization means North Korea agrees to gives up its nuclear weapons program. North Korea argues that the term should include U.S. action too \u2014 such as removing strategic bombers from Guam, and no longer including South Korea under its nuclear umbrella in Asia.\nHaving a shared understanding of what denuclearization means could at least offer reassurances that the U.S. and North Korea are debating the same thing.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s going to take us four or five meetings just to close the gap in terms of how we define denuclearization, then the process really isn\u2019t a process,\u201d Victor Cha, a former U.S. National Security Council official who is now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told reporters last week.\nSetting Deadlines\nPutting commitments down on paper is one thing. Forcing the two sides meet deadlines for those promises is another.\nThe U.S. position on how quickly negotiations with North Korea should advance has varied wildly. Kim himself has never said how long he expects the talks to extend. After the first summit, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said denuclearization should be wrapped up by the end of Trump\u2019s first term. Trump has said that as long as Kim abstains from weapons tests, he doesn\u2019t care how long the process takes.\nNorth Korea will almost certainly seek to exploit that ambiguity and push for the process to drag on. That way, support for the U.S. campaign to isolate the country steadily weakens. But setting markers for working-level negotiations would help propel talks forward, according to Robert Carlin, a former CIA and State Department intelligence analyst who took part in negotiations with North Korea under President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration.\n\u201cMost important is that the document lays out what should be happening over the next four to six months in terms of detailed negotiations so that the working level has instructions from on high,\u201d Carlin said. \u201cIf things get snagged, each side can pull out the paper and say, \u2018Look, here\u2019s what your leader agreed to.\u201d\u2019\nPeace Declaration\nThere is intense speculation that the two sides will sign a declaration agreeing to end the Korean War, and establish \u201cliaison offices\u201d \u2014 a partial diplomatic presence \u2014 within each other\u2019s borders.\nBut those ideas are accompanied with anxiety that Trump will win nothing in exchange for a peace declaration \u2014 or might even commit to withdraw some of the 30,000 American soldiers in South Korea. Experts generally agree that Kim would see a peace declaration as an achievement to bring home to his own people and tout as a major success \u2014 particularly if he gets it without any major concessions to Trump.\n\u201cOfficially saying that they are not at war anymore is probably fine but on the other hand the bargain hunter in me knows how badly North Korea wants that,\u201d said Hanham, of the One Earth Future Foundation. \u201cI do think the U.S. should extract something for it.\u201d",

Americans are importing far more from abroad than they are exporting\u2014imports grew 7.5% while exports increased only 6.3%.\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut enacted in late 2017 served to further fuel the deficit. The government had to borrow to pay for the cut, and some of those dollars came from foreign investors.\nSimultaneously, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates four times last year to offset fears of an overheating economy, thereby increasing the strength of the dollar and encouraging purchase of relatively inexpensive foreign goods.\nThis is the third consecutive year of increasing trade deficits, topping the previous record in 2006. But while that might be of concern for Trump, many economists disagree with his emphasis on reducing the deficit. They suggest such deficits are not a reflection of American trading relationships, but rather simply a reflection of a variety of economic forces.",

The bank&rsquo;s financial relationship with private-prison operators has drawn heightened scrutiny in recent years, particularly as those facilities have been used to detain undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://buy.tinypass.com/checkout/offer/show?displayMode=inline&containerSelector=%23freestar-instream-content+%3E+%3Anth-child(3)&templateId=OTOSS1IW2M4X&offerId=OFGHA7H914S6&formNameByTermId=%7B%7D&showCloseButton=false&experienceId=EXR3N7C334H7&iframeId=offer-0-K07fa&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2019%2F03%2F14%2Fjpmorgan-chase-private-prisons%2F&parentDualScreenLeft=0&parentDualScreenTop=0&parentWidth=1366&parentHeight=768&parentOuterHeight=600&aid=cfQj2fM3zj&pianoIdUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fid.tinypass.com%2Fid%2F&userProvider=piano_id&userToken=&customCookies=%7B%7D&hasLoginRequiredCallback=true&width=588&_qh=2558514285\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>JPMorgan&rsquo;s decision to no longer be a party to such practices comes at a time when the Trump administration&rsquo;s hardline stance on illegal immigration&mdash;and its treatment of undocumented families who have attempted to cross the southern border into the U.S.&mdash;has faced widespread ire and condemnation.</p>\n<p>Yet the bank almost certainly didn&rsquo;t come to this realization on its own. JPMorgan has been no stranger to public demonstrations criticizing its involvement in industries ranging from private prisons to fossil fuels, with protesters going as far as disrupting the company&rsquo;s shareholder meetings and picketing outside CEO Jamie Dimon&rsquo;s Manhattan apartment.</p>\n<p>And, like the financial services industry at large, it&rsquo;s also had a new regulatory regime to reckon with since Democrats took control of the House of Representatives last fall. None other than Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who sits on the House Financial Services Committee, last month called for hearings to hold &ldquo;banks accountable for investing in and making money off of the detention of immigrants.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>JPMorgan&rsquo;s retreat from the private prison sector reflects the extent to which environmental, social, and governance (known as &ldquo;ESG&rdquo;) criteria have embedded themselves in the thinking of the financial services world. Wall Street is coming to terms with the shifting values of investors and shareholders alike when it comes to topics like climate change and human rights, and it&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/08/20/bank-of-america-wind-solar-energy/\">having an impact on the way they do business</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s going to happen at a lot of banks&mdash;especially banks with a national profile that rely on widespread consumer sentiment to support their operations,&rdquo; according to John Engle, president of Chicago-based merchant banking and venture capital firm Almington Capital.</p>\n<p>According to Engle, there&rsquo;s &ldquo;little indication&rdquo; that Dimon and the JPMorgan brass &ldquo;have had a come-to-Jesus moment on the subject of private prisons,&rdquo; or that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;taking moral lessons from [Ocasio-Cortez].&rdquo; But like Wells Fargo&mdash;which in January announced that it would wind down its credit exposure to private prison companies as part of its &ldquo;environmental and social risk management&rdquo; policy&mdash;the bank&rsquo;s decision likely stemmed from a cost-benefit analysis that showed that stepping away from &ldquo;a few billion dollars worth of loans in exposure&rdquo; could prove to be &ldquo;an inexpensive way of shifting the ire of political critics.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Indeed, private prisons are a relatively minuscule portion of the book for major banks, which lent less than $2 billion across three deals for CoreCivic and GEO Group in 2018, per Refinitiv data cited by Reuters, which <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jp-morgan-prisons/jpmorgan-backs-away-from-private-prison-finance-idUSKCN1QM1LE\">first reported</a> the news of JPMorgan&rsquo;s private-prison retreat.</p>\n<p>The same cannot be said for industries like fossil fuels, which many banks have shown to consider too profitable to sacrifice in favor of ESG values. While pursuing sustainability initiatives like a commitment to $200 billion in &ldquo;clean financing&rdquo; by 2025, JPMorgan has also been labeled &ldquo;the top U.S. funder of extreme fossil fuels,&rdquo; according to the Rainforest Action Network. In fact, the environmental group claims the bank&mdash;which has lent money to TransCanada, the energy company behind the controversial Keystone XL pipeline project&mdash;has recently <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/the-understory/jpmorgan_chase_case_study/\">increased its exposure</a> to tar sands oil and coal mining projects.</p>\n<p>As more members of the millennial generation come of &ldquo;investment age,&rdquo; big banks may well find its practices under greater scrutiny. Numerous players in the private equity and investment management sector have come to recognize that <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/08/22/stocks-esg-arabesque-ti-cummins/\">there&rsquo;s a market for ESG-focused funds</a> and have increased related investment offerings. Just last week&mdash;the same week in which JPMorgan announced it was exiting the private prison business&mdash;investment giant Vanguard announced the launch of its first actively managed ESG equity fund.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Increasingly, investors want to do both well financially and good socially,&rdquo; says Robert R. Johnson, a professor of finance at Creighton University&rsquo;s Heider College of Business. Johnson notes that as the more environmentally- and socially-conscious millennial generation comes to represent a larger portion of the investor base, &ldquo;incorporating ESG concerns into their decision-making is simply a good business decision&rdquo; for corporations and financial institutions.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s not a reach in an era when some firms have carved a niche for themselves as being dedicated specifically to ESG-focused investments. Michael Lent is the founding principal and CIO of one such firm, San Francisco-based Veris Wealth Partners, which he says has found the performance of its funds &ldquo;comparable&rdquo; to those that don&rsquo;t incorporate ESG criteria.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no performance penalty for incorporating these issues into our portfolio construction,&rdquo; says Lent, whose firm has $1.1 billion in assets under management across its ESG-targeted funds. &ldquo;A lot of investors, for various reasons, want to have a focus around ESG factors, and they don&rsquo;t want to be invested in something that they don&rsquo;t agree with.&rdquo; He cites nonprofit foundations, faith-based organizations and family offices among the types of investors who have shown particular appetite for ESG-focused vehicles.</p>\n<p>San Francisco-based Newday Impact Investing, meanwhile, has specifically looked to target millennial investors via portfolios comprising companies with ESG values. &ldquo;It was a decade ago when responsible investment was viewed very much as a concessionary exercise,&rdquo; says Newday CEO Doug Heske. &ldquo;The fact is that organizations are making responsible investment decisions that demonstrate a significantly lower cost of capital.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Newday is also embracing ESG principles as it ventures into the personal checking and savings market&mdash;with plans to partner with a regional bank that doesn&rsquo;t lend to the likes of fossil fuel companies or arms manufacturers. Heske, who declined to the name the bank that Newday is partnering with, says the millennial generation and their even younger &ldquo;Generation Z&rdquo; counterparts are driving the market for ESG-oriented personal finance offerings. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to be more vocal about trying to dictate where their savings and assets go,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p>Almington Capital&rsquo;s Engle agrees. &ldquo;Eventually, the millennials will be not only the biggest spenders and operators in the economy, but the parents of the next generation&mdash;which will probably be even more socially conscious,&rdquo; he notes.</p>\n<p>With that kind of demographic shift in the works, it&rsquo;s unsurprising that JPMorgan took the opportunity to show where it stands on a divisive issue like private prisons. But with the bank still deeply invested in fossil fuels and other industries, it remains to be seen just how far major financial institutions are willing to go in embracing an ESG revolution.</p>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://www.dianomi.com/smartads.epl?id=4953\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "The nation\u2019s largest bank grew a conscience last week, and millennials may be to blame.\nJPMorgan Chase said last Tuesday that it would no longer finance the operations of CoreCivic (formerly the Corrections Corporation of America) and the GEO Group, effectively cutting all ties with the private prison industry. The bank\u2019s financial relationship with private-prison operators has drawn heightened scrutiny in recent years, particularly as those facilities have been used to detain undocumented immigrants.\nJPMorgan\u2019s decision to no longer be a party to such practices comes at a time when the Trump administration\u2019s hardline stance on illegal immigration\u2014and its treatment of undocumented families who have attempted to cross the southern border into the U.S.\u2014has faced widespread ire and condemnation.\nYet the bank almost certainly didn\u2019t come to this realization on its own. JPMorgan has been no stranger to public demonstrations criticizing its involvement in industries ranging from private prisons to fossil fuels, with protesters going as far as disrupting the company\u2019s shareholder meetings and picketing outside CEO Jamie Dimon\u2019s Manhattan apartment.\nAnd, like the financial services industry at large, it\u2019s also had a new regulatory regime to reckon with since Democrats took control of the House of Representatives last fall. None other than Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who sits on the House Financial Services Committee, last month called for hearings to hold \u201cbanks accountable for investing in and making money off of the detention of immigrants.\u201d\nJPMorgan\u2019s retreat from the private prison sector reflects the extent to which environmental, social, and governance (known as \u201cESG\u201d) criteria have embedded themselves in the thinking of the financial services world. Wall Street is coming to terms with the shifting values of investors and shareholders alike when it comes to topics like climate change and human rights, and it\u2019s having an impact on the way they do business.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s going to happen at a lot of banks\u2014especially banks with a national profile that rely on widespread consumer sentiment to support their operations,\u201d according to John Engle, president of Chicago-based merchant banking and venture capital firm Almington Capital.\nAccording to Engle, there\u2019s \u201clittle indication\u201d that Dimon and the JPMorgan brass \u201chave had a come-to-Jesus moment on the subject of private prisons,\u201d or that they\u2019re \u201ctaking moral lessons from [Ocasio-Cortez].\u201d But like Wells Fargo\u2014which in January announced that it would wind down its credit exposure to private prison companies as part of its \u201cenvironmental and social risk management\u201d policy\u2014the bank\u2019s decision likely stemmed from a cost-benefit analysis that showed that stepping away from \u201ca few billion dollars worth of loans in exposure\u201d could prove to be \u201can inexpensive way of shifting the ire of political critics.\u201d\nIndeed, private prisons are a relatively minuscule portion of the book for major banks, which lent less than $2 billion across three deals for CoreCivic and GEO Group in 2018, per Refinitiv data cited by Reuters, which first reported the news of JPMorgan\u2019s private-prison retreat.\nThe same cannot be said for industries like fossil fuels, which many banks have shown to consider too profitable to sacrifice in favor of ESG values. While pursuing sustainability initiatives like a commitment to $200 billion in \u201cclean financing\u201d by 2025, JPMorgan has also been labeled \u201cthe top U.S. funder of extreme fossil fuels,\u201d according to the Rainforest Action Network. In fact, the environmental group claims the bank\u2014which has lent money to TransCanada, the energy company behind the controversial Keystone XL pipeline project\u2014has recently increased its exposure to tar sands oil and coal mining projects.\nAs more members of the millennial generation come of \u201cinvestment age,\u201d big banks may well find its practices under greater scrutiny. Numerous players in the private equity and investment management sector have come to recognize that there\u2019s a market for ESG-focused funds and have increased related investment offerings. Just last week\u2014the same week in which JPMorgan announced it was exiting the private prison business\u2014investment giant Vanguard announced the launch of its first actively managed ESG equity fund.\n\u201cIncreasingly, investors want to do both well financially and good socially,\u201d says Robert R. Johnson, a professor of finance at Creighton University\u2019s Heider College of Business. Johnson notes that as the more environmentally- and socially-conscious millennial generation comes to represent a larger portion of the investor base, \u201cincorporating ESG concerns into their decision-making is simply a good business decision\u201d for corporations and financial institutions.\nThat\u2019s not a reach in an era when some firms have carved a niche for themselves as being dedicated specifically to ESG-focused investments. Michael Lent is the founding principal and CIO of one such firm, San Francisco-based Veris Wealth Partners, which he says has found the performance of its funds \u201ccomparable\u201d to those that don\u2019t incorporate ESG criteria.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no performance penalty for incorporating these issues into our portfolio construction,\u201d says Lent, whose firm has $1.1 billion in assets under management across its ESG-targeted funds. \u201cA lot of investors, for various reasons, want to have a focus around ESG factors, and they don\u2019t want to be invested in something that they don\u2019t agree with.\u201d He cites nonprofit foundations, faith-based organizations and family offices among the types of investors who have shown particular appetite for ESG-focused vehicles.\nSan Francisco-based Newday Impact Investing, meanwhile, has specifically looked to target millennial investors via portfolios comprising companies with ESG values. \u201cIt was a decade ago when responsible investment was viewed very much as a concessionary exercise,\u201d says Newday CEO Doug Heske. \u201cThe fact is that organizations are making responsible investment decisions that demonstrate a significantly lower cost of capital.\u201d\nNewday is also embracing ESG principles as it ventures into the personal checking and savings market\u2014with plans to partner with a regional bank that doesn\u2019t lend to the likes of fossil fuel companies or arms manufacturers. Heske, who declined to the name the bank that Newday is partnering with, says the millennial generation and their even younger \u201cGeneration Z\u201d counterparts are driving the market for ESG-oriented personal finance offerings. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more vocal about trying to dictate where their savings and assets go,\u201d he says.\nAlmington Capital\u2019s Engle agrees. \u201cEventually, the millennials will be not only the biggest spenders and operators in the economy, but the parents of the next generation\u2014which will probably be even more socially conscious,\u201d he notes.\nWith that kind of demographic shift in the works, it\u2019s unsurprising that JPMorgan took the opportunity to show where it stands on a divisive issue like private prisons. But with the bank still deeply invested in fossil fuels and other industries, it remains to be seen just how far major financial institutions are willing to go in embracing an ESG revolution.",

If Trout was a California resident, noted CPA Robert Raiola on Twitter, he would pocket less than half of the contract\u2019s amount, netting $214 million once he had paid his state and federal income taxes.

Must act quickly!\u201d France\u2019s civil defense agency, S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Civile, without mentioning Trump, underscored why that would be a terrible idea.\nIt was a reply that quickly got the Twitter population buzzing and a not-so-subtle way for French authorities to suggest that the massive fire was not an issue where they wanted fire-fighting advice from a politician.\nFrench fire officials, late Monday, said Notre Dame had been saved from \u201ctotal destruciton,\u201d though the roof did collapse.\nSo horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019\nHundreds of firemen of the Paris Fire Brigade are doing everything they can to bring the terrible #NotreDame fire under control. All means are being used, except for water-bombing aircrafts which, if used, could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral.\n\u2014 S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Civile Fr (@SecCivileFrance) April 15, 2019\nThe U.S. and French governments have had a rocky relationship for several months.

(PHILIPPE WOJAZER AFP/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The wood for the soaring cathedral was first felled around 1160 to 1170, with some of it coming from trees thought to be 300 to 400 years old at the time they were chopped. That puts the oldest timber in the cathedral at nearly 1,300 years old.</p>\n<p>Replacing those beams with comparable oak is simply not an option, said Bertrand de Feydeau, vice president of the preservation group Fondation du Patrimoine. Trees that supplied the roof&rsquo;s frame came from primary forests&mdash;forests that are largely untouched by human activity, he said, according to the <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/0978e08a5e4848348cdb80745ab2ab8a\">AP.</a> He surmised that the huge trees associated with primary forests are gone too.</p>\n<p>Notre Dame&rsquo;s official website notes that even in the 12th century, when the cathedral was being built, human activity was already a concern for French forests, with urbanization and land clearing making it difficult to source wood large enough for the design of the cathedral.</p>\n<p>Since then, the impact of human activity on primary forests has only become more pronounced.</p>\n<p>Only 4% of Europe&rsquo;s remaining woodland is primary forest, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.12778\">according to a study published last May</a>, with none larger than 500 square kilometers outside of Russia or Northern Europe.</p>\n<p>While forest covers nearly a third of mainland France, just 0.01% of it is untouched, containing trees around 200 to 400 years old, said Dr. Francesco Maria Sabatini, a lead author on the study and a researcher at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Primary forests are small, fragile and precious for biodiversity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They represent &lsquo;pearls&rsquo; or &lsquo;islands&rsquo; that survived intensive logging thanks to their remoteness or historical accidents.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Based on the AP&rsquo;s translation, de Feydeau associated a tree&rsquo;s size with its primary forest origin. That&rsquo;s not necessarily accurate, Sabatini said; the oldest trees aren&rsquo;t always the largest ones when we&rsquo;re measuring a tree&rsquo;s age in centuries. It&rsquo;s borderline impossible to visually tell the difference between a living tree 100 years old and one that&rsquo;s 400 years old, he said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is very little correlation between size and age,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>De Feydeau&rsquo;s Fondation du Patrimoine did not return <em>Fortune</em>&lsquo;s request for comment.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, logging of Europe&rsquo;s ancient forests has not only continued but increased in some areas. Large forests of that kind only exist in remote regions in northern and Eastern Europe, where rising demand for timber has pushed up prices and encouraged logging in more distant areas, with some of it being done illegally.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, there is simply no way to replace wood that predates the founding of even medieval France&mdash;from ancient forests or otherwise.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Extracting timber from the last primary remnants means losing also these, and this loss won&rsquo;t cover up the tragedy of losing Notre Dame,&rdquo; said Sabatini. &ldquo;It will simply add up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>De Feydeau seemed to come to this conclusion too: Notre Dame, he said, will have to rely on new technologies to rebuild.</p>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://www.dianomi.com/smartads.epl?id=4953\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "As flames erupted in the attic of Paris\u2019s Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday, some 400 firefighters rushed to save one of Europe\u2019s great historical and architectural symbols.\nThe blaze, the cause of which remains unknown, raged for 12 hours, toppling Notre Dame\u2019s 13th Century center spire in the process. The Paris Police Force deemed it extinguished on Tuesday morning, noting that the stone structure of the cathedral had been saved.\nPhilippe Wojazer\u2014AFP/Getty Images\nThe wood for the soaring cathedral was first felled around 1160 to 1170, with some of it coming from trees thought to be 300 to 400 years old at the time they were chopped. That puts the oldest timber in the cathedral at nearly 1,300 years old.\nReplacing those beams with comparable oak is simply not an option, said Bertrand de Feydeau, vice president of the preservation group Fondation du Patrimoine. Trees that supplied the roof\u2019s frame came from primary forests\u2014forests that are largely untouched by human activity, he said, according to the AP. He surmised that the huge trees associated with primary forests are gone too.\nNotre Dame\u2019s official website notes that even in the 12th century, when the cathedral was being built, human activity was already a concern for French forests, with urbanization and land clearing making it difficult to source wood large enough for the design of the cathedral.\nSince then, the impact of human activity on primary forests has only become more pronounced.\nOnly 4% of Europe\u2019s remaining woodland is primary forest, according to a study published last May, with none larger than 500 square kilometers outside of Russia or Northern Europe.\nWhile forest covers nearly a third of mainland France, just 0.01% of it is untouched, containing trees around 200 to 400 years old, said Dr. Francesco Maria Sabatini, a lead author on the study and a researcher at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research.\n\u201cPrimary forests are small, fragile and precious for biodiversity,\u201d he said. \u201cThey represent \u2018pearls\u2019 or \u2018islands\u2019 that survived intensive logging thanks to their remoteness or historical accidents.\u201d\nBased on the AP\u2019s translation, de Feydeau associated a tree\u2019s size with its primary forest origin. That\u2019s not necessarily accurate, Sabatini said; the oldest trees aren\u2019t always the largest ones when we\u2019re measuring a tree\u2019s age in centuries. It\u2019s borderline impossible to visually tell the difference between a living tree 100 years old and one that\u2019s 400 years old, he said.\n\u201cThere is very little correlation between size and age,\u201d he said.\nDe Feydeau\u2019s Fondation du Patrimoine did not return Fortune\u2018s request for comment.\nNonetheless, logging of Europe\u2019s ancient forests has not only continued but increased in some areas. Large forests of that kind only exist in remote regions in northern and Eastern Europe, where rising demand for timber has pushed up prices and encouraged logging in more distant areas, with some of it being done illegally.\nUltimately, there is simply no way to replace wood that predates the founding of even medieval France\u2014from ancient forests or otherwise.\n\u201cExtracting timber from the last primary remnants means losing also these, and this loss won\u2019t cover up the tragedy of losing Notre Dame,\u201d said Sabatini. \u201cIt will simply add up.\u201d\nDe Feydeau seemed to come to this conclusion too: Notre Dame, he said, will have to rely on new technologies to rebuild.",

                "html": "<p><strong>In the elegant quiet</strong> of the caf&eacute; at the Church of Sweden, a narrow Gothic-style building in Midtown Manhattan, Daniel Cohen is taking a break from explaining genetics. He moves toward the creaky piano positioned near the front door, sits down, and plays a flowing, flawless rendition of &ldquo;Over the Rainbow.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If human biology is the scientific equivalent of a complicated score, Cohen has learned how to navigate it like a virtuoso. Cohen was the driving force behind G&eacute;n&eacute;thon, the French laboratory that in December 1993 produced the first-ever &ldquo;map&rdquo; of the human genome. He essentially introduced Big Data and automation to the study of genomics, as he and his team demonstrated for the first time that it was possible to use super-fast computing to speed up the processing of DNA samples.</p>\n<p>Scientists worldwide have built on Cohen&rsquo;s insights, and Cohen himself, an MD with a Ph.D. in immunology, has gone on to success as a researcher and pharma executive. But a quarter-century later, genomics has yielded few of the kinds of paradigm-changing medical breakthroughs that many of its early innovators hoped for. Today, as chief executive and founder of Paris-based drug startup Pharnext, Cohen is striving to understand why that rainbow hasn&rsquo;t led to a pot of gold.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Any protein in the body has many different functions, not only one,&rdquo; he says, returning from the piano to talk with me, &ldquo;just as you are a person who has many functions in the population, not just one.&rdquo; The phenomenon Cohen is describing is &ldquo;pleiotropy,&rdquo; the capacity of a single gene to have multiple, seemingly unrelated effects. It is one of the complexities of disease that has repeatedly frustrated medical researchers in their quest for therapies for the most stubborn illnesses.</p>\n<p>Cohen not only appreciates pleiotropy&rsquo;s significance: He believes that Pharnext and other drugmakers may soon exploit it&mdash;with a powerful boost from artificial intelligence. By embracing the body&rsquo;s complexity, and by using A.I. to more methodically analyze and map the way the chain reactions of disease sweep through the body, he hopes to develop combinations of drugs tuned to attack a plethora of medical conditions.</p>\n<blockquote> <h2><em><strong>In theory, with repurposing &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need to design new drugs,&rdquo; says Cohen. &ldquo;With 50 drugs, we can treat everything.&rdquo;</strong></em></h2> </blockquote>\n<p>Cohen and his team are also applying A.I. to search for therapies that leverage &ldquo;repurposing&rdquo;&mdash;combining existing drugs in ways that give them therapeutic powers that each lacks in isolation. Their long-term goal is a drug pipeline that is far more efficient than Big Pharma&rsquo;s notoriously slow R&amp;D departments&mdash;streamlined by machine learning. Cohen&rsquo;s sleepy gaze widens with enthusiasm when he describes how it&rsquo;s all coming along. &ldquo;<em>Tr&egrave;s bien</em>,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;<em>Tr&egrave;s &eacute;conomique</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Running in the same race as Pharnext are companies ranging from giants like <a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/alphabet/\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/ibm/\">IBM</a> to startups such as Insilico Medicine, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and BenevolentAI. All are deeply invested in the tools of A.I., using them to analyze millions of examples of drug and patient data and tease out patterns of significance. But Pharnext, founded in 2007, predates most of those competitors by several years&mdash;and has a longer head start when one factors in Cohen&rsquo;s decades of earlier research in genomics and pleiotropy.</p>\n<p>And perhaps most important, Pharnext&rsquo;s application of A.I. to medical problems over the course of more than a decade has finally reached a critical inflection point. In October, Pharnext reported positive results for a Phase III trial in humans of one of its drug combinations. The compound is PXT3003, a treatment for a neurodegenerative condition called Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a rare disorder for which no cure has been found. The primary cause of CMT is duplication of a single gene, but a whole cascade of bad things ensues &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; from that mutation. Schwann cells, which protect nerves, regress into stem cells that don&rsquo;t do their job. Axons in the nerves begin to die off. Muscles can&rsquo;t be controlled, and they shrink as a consequence.</p>\n<p>According to Pharnext, its Phase III results (which have not yet been peer-reviewed) showed CMT not merely stabilizing under PXT3003 but also being reversed, as cells began regenerating. Previous treatments, Cohen says, had managed only to slow patients&rsquo; decline. Under PXT3003, patients showed statistically significant improvement on two measures of disability. Based on those results, in February the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Pharnext &ldquo;fast track&rdquo; status for that therapy&mdash;an accelerated review process, awarded only when the agency thinks a drug demonstrates &ldquo;superior effectiveness&rdquo; in treating a serious disease.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bio04.19.cmt-pathways.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bio04.19.cmt-pathways.jpg?w=1024\"></img></a><figcaption>PATHWAYS: To help find therapies, A.I.-driven startups build maps that show how genes, proteins, and the body interact as diseases progress.

Courtesy of Pharnext</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It is, to be sure, only one hopeful step against one rare ailment. Still, technology has shortened Pharnext&rsquo;s path in ways with promising long-term implications, shaving years off the drug-design timeline. Preclinical testing and clinical trials generally take eight to 10 years, and developing a novel drug completely from scratch can add seven years to the process, sometimes much more. In the case of PXT3003, in contrast, A.I. helped Pharnext select three existing drugs to repurpose: baclofen, a muscle relaxant; naltrexone, used to treat opioid dependence; and sorbitol, a glucose reduction used as a laxative. Because the drugs were already in use, Pharnext could skip the Phase I trials normally required to ensure their safety&mdash;and eliminate the &ldquo;build from scratch&rdquo; stage.</p>\n<p>FDA fast-tracking increases the odds that PXT3003 could be on the market as soon as 2020&mdash;and it&rsquo;s only one of Pharnext&rsquo;s many projects. The company will soon begin a second Phase II trial of a drug with indications for Alzheimer&rsquo;s and a first Phase II trial for an ALS therapy, in both cases using a similar repurposed combination.</p>\n<p>Just as important: If these experiments succeed, copycats with deeper pockets could follow suit. Kathleen Sebelius, a secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration who is now a consultant and board member for several health care companies, sees the efforts as part of a growing trend to repurpose. &ldquo;That all leads to the possibility of a lot shorter investment cycle, and potentially a very different pricing point, and lots of possibilities for rare diseases where there just hasn&rsquo;t been enough of a financial incentive,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And that has lots of appeal.&rdquo; Eric Kandel of the Kavli Institute for Brain Science at Columbia University, a winner of the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine who is an adviser to Pharnext, says that the startup is at the leading edge of the trend, calling its methodology &ldquo;both original and powerful.&rdquo; As for whether that approach will catch on widely, Kandel adds, &ldquo;We should know soon.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>At the dawn </strong>of modern genetic research, almost no one anticipated the enormous complexity in the biology of disease. Many researchers thought the genome would be a kind of instruction manual for the body. Pioneers such as Celera Genomics&rsquo; Craig Venter and Francis Collins of the National Institutes of Health were celebrated as &ldquo;gene hunters,&rdquo; a term that evoked crusaders scouring the globe for that one &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; gene that would explain&mdash;and facilitate a cure for&mdash;a given disease.</p>\n<p>To some extent, these researchers found real treasure. Geneticist Nancy Wexler, for example, spent years in Venezuela compiling family trees of those affected by Huntington&rsquo;s disease, a rare, inherited condition. Her work led to the discovery of the mutation in a single gene that predicts whether an individual will contract the condition.</p>\n<p>But scientists soon realized that genetic maps were less like an instruction manual and more like the parts catalog you get with Ikea furniture. What&rsquo;s more, researchers discovered other catalogs that added complex variables to the relationships between genes and disease&mdash;for example, the proteome, the proteins encoded by DNA, and the transcriptome, all the nucleic acids that convert DNA into proteins.</p>\n<p>The morning-after disappointment has proved wrenching, as researchers learned that complex diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer&rsquo;s, didn&rsquo;t yield to a single gene. (Even Huntington&rsquo;s, its gene identified, has remained untreatable.) Today, Cohen and others see a link between the obsession with simplicity and a decline in drug discovery. That decline shows itself in the 1-in-10 success rate for FDA approval of new therapies; in spiraling costs for drug development (what a Tufts study recently identified as &ldquo;the $2.6 billion pill&rdquo;); and in the soaring prices of the few treatments that break new ground, such as the $475,000 cost of a course of treatment with Novartis&rsquo;s leukemia drug Kymriah.</p>\n<p>More recently, researchers have begun to grapple with biological complexity with the help of the science of networks. That science&rsquo;s chief evangelist is Albert-L&aacute;szl&oacute; Barab&aacute;si, a professor at Northeastern University whose 2014 book <em>Linked</em> popularized the notion that network theory can explain numerous fields, from fashion trends to sexual relations to disease. Barab&aacute;si and others realized that disease is like a bad signal that moves through a network of connections from genes to proteins to cells to tissues, until all these &ldquo;perturbations&rdquo; manifest as the familiar symptoms of disease.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bio04.19.cmt-awarness-ads.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bio04.19.cmt-awarness-ads.jpg?w=1024\"></img></a><figcaption>Ads posted in the Paris Metro as part of a public-awareness campaign about CMT.

Startups like Pharnext assume that drugs can also be pleiotropic, acting on more than one protein and more than one interaction in the body at the same time. To find a drug combination capable of tackling complexity, the enormous power of machine learning, with its ability to spot patterns in data, must be wedded to a sense of the structure by which disease operates.</p>\n<p>This, in turn, has required an evolution in the relationship between computer scientists and biologists. Newer machine-learning approaches ingest vastly more data and can assemble hierarchies of information that let them go beyond correlation. Still, harnessing these &ldquo;deep learning&rdquo; neural networks into a structure that has any predictive power requires some elegant algorithm-building.</p>\n<p>Colin Hill, CEO and founder of GNS Healthcare, is one of the builders. His company, based in Cambridge, Mass., has spent 18 years developing a computer system called REFS, which stands for &ldquo;reverse engineering, forward simulation.&rdquo; GNS has raised a total of $38 million over the years&mdash;from <a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/amgen/\">Amgen</a> Ventures, the venture capital arm of the drug giant, along with <a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/celgene/\">Celgene</a> and a variety of other investors&mdash;to build and fine-tune its models of disease. And in a recent series of trials, first published in 2017 in the medical journal <em>The Lancet</em>, GNS has detailed REFS&rsquo;s potential when applied to a disease such as Parkinson&rsquo;s&mdash;an ailment in which pleiotropic factors render existing treatments wildly hit-or-miss in their effectiveness.</p>\n<p>With Parkinson&rsquo;s, the network of interactions set in motion by defective genes has a particular shape to it, and the breakdown of motor functioning is the most reliable indication of its progression. Feeding the genetic data of Parkinson&rsquo;s sufferers and a control group into REFS helped GNS generate over 100 computer models depicting what might be going on as motor function deteriorates. The models can uncover previously unknown genetic mutations that may contribute to the speedup of deterioration.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bio_graphic.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bio_graphic.png\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>But that&rsquo;s just the first part. GNS has used those findings to create 5,000 different computer simulations of randomized control trials, each aiming to predict how fast the disease would progress with varying approaches to treatment. Such speed-testing can be vastly more economical than seeking the same result through controlled human trials. And GNS, in partnership with other drugmakers, is now applying similar approaches to treatments for diabetes, ALS, multiple myeloma, and breast cancer, among other diseases.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We now have the ability to create and construct, on the computer, representations of human patients and their diseases such that we can now probe, drug by drug, care management intervention by care management intervention, and say what treatments work for which patient,&rdquo; says Colin Hill, CEO of GNS.</p>\n<p>The simulation, in other words, is not just finding correlations: It is answering <em>What if</em> questions. What if we had given drug A instead of drug B to patient X? That ability to simulate and answer counterfactuals is a recent arrival in the practice of A.I. It owes its growing importance in large part to GNS&rsquo;s technology adviser, Judea Pearl, a longtime A.I. researcher and professor of computer science at UCLA. In a popular volume published last year called <em>The Book of Why</em>, Pearl describes how true intelligence ascends from merely noticing patterns, which machine learning does in spades, to being able to express counterfactual reasoning about what would have happened, based on those patterns. Data alone, disconnected from any idea of a mechanism, doesn&rsquo;t provide real insight. &ldquo;Data is profoundly dumb about causality,&rdquo; claims Pearl. Hill puts it more bluntly: &ldquo;Deep learning is not that deep.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel Cohen, now 67,</strong> spent his childhood in Tunisia&rsquo;s heterogeneous society of Jews, Christians, Muslims, &ldquo;living all together in a very elegant and pacific way.&rdquo; He credits that experience for his taste for &ldquo;things that are not complicated, but complex.&rdquo; When he was 9, Cohen&rsquo;s family immigrated to Paris, where he pursued the piano avidly. He switched to medicine once he realized he might have a greater impact as a scientist than a musician, but the passion has not left him. He has been a guest conductor at the Royal Philharmonic in London and dreams of leading that ensemble in Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s <em>Symphony Path&eacute;tique</em>. &ldquo;The predisposition to orchestra conductor, CEO, and scientist are all controlled by the same genes,&rdquo; he jokes.</p>\n<p>Parlaying genomics and technology into pharmaceutical success is something Cohen has done before. He was a cofounder of Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a U.S. oncology-drug maker that helped develop the multiple-myeloma treatment Velcade.</p>\n<p>Cohen is bullish that Pharnext can be successful with A.I., but he is also aware of the technology&rsquo;s limitations. Google&rsquo;s AlphaZero, an A.I. program, was able to beat the world&rsquo;s human masters at the Chinese strategy game Go, without using any prior human knowledge. But as Cohen points out, Go has a finite set of rules, which AlphaZero knew completely. In biology, thanks in part to pleiotropy, the rules are not fully known&mdash;and may never be.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bio04.19.daniel-cohen-piano.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bio04.19.daniel-cohen-piano.jpg?w=1024\"></img></a><figcaption>Pharnext CEO Daniel Cohen trained as a pianist before switching to medicine. Photograph by Roberto Frankenberg for</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But thoughtfully designed A.I. has enabled Pharnext to build models around the rules that <em>are</em> known and make choices accordingly. Out of the universe of 10,000 known drugs, the company&rsquo;s discovery model takes in an assortment of 2,000 that are both out of patent and &ldquo;marketed&rdquo;&mdash;that is, already judged both therapeutically effective and safe enough to be sold to the public.</p>\n<p>To develop its CMT drug, Pharnext first spent about a year assembling its network model for the disease&mdash;a framework comparable to GNS&rsquo;s Parkinson&rsquo;s map, showing how nervous and muscular problems &ldquo;cascade&rdquo; from the relevant gene mutation. Based on this mechanism, the computer model arrived at a short list of 57 candidate drugs that addressed various points in the cascade. Pharnext tested those drugs one by one in vitro, generating a shorter list of 22 to be tested in mice, which finally yielded the three-drug combination that went to human clinical trials. The recent positive Phase III results confirmed that the PXT3003 cocktail is acting at various points in the cascade.</p>\n<p>Without the A.I. model, many more years of preclinical testing would have been required beyond the three years it took Pharnext, says Cohen. &ldquo;With 2,000 drugs [to start with], I could produce all possible combinations, a billion possibilities&rdquo; to test in vitro. That&rsquo;s a recipe for countless false positives and dead ends&mdash;years of frustration, for now forestalled.</p>\n<p><strong>Pharnext&rsquo;s shares,</strong> which trade on the Paris stock exchange, have more than doubled since October&rsquo;s Phase III results announcement. The company has spent about 120 million euros ($135 million) over the past decade on research and development&mdash;a very modest figure by pharma standards. It has never made a profit, but analysts estimate that if PXT3003 reaches the market, revenue&mdash;9 million euros in 2018&mdash;could soar starting in 2020. (GNS Healthcare is privately held and does not disclose spending or revenue.)</p>\n<p>Beyond possible victories for investors, the advances at Pharnext and GNS point the way to A.I.&rsquo;s growing up&mdash;and pharmacology along with it. The ability to reason about causality, and to explore counterfactual questions, is a threshold that users of artificial intelligence have long sought to cross. The computer models at these startups are making a foray in that direction as they manage and tame a bewildering number of variables.</p>\n<p>Even the underlying definition of disease may evolve. As scientists are learning, these definitions have been overly simplistic. A study in the journal <em>Bioinformatics</em> last year noted that attempts to treat tumors are hampered by the fact that genetic mutations in cancer are &ldquo;fundamentally heterogeneous&rdquo;: What appears as one disease, or class of disease, in fact contains few commonalities and many differences from patient to patient. As it becomes clear that what&rsquo;s happening in any body differs sharply from the &ldquo;on/off&rdquo; model of one gene turning on a set of symptoms, technology can help drug developers wrestle with the complexity.</p>\n<p>Last, but hardly least, these A.I.-driven efforts offer a glimmer of economic hope. In an era in which the cost of drug development is a daunting obstacle, smart algorithms may someday enable medical stakeholders to derive more value from the trillions of dollars that have already been spent on drug research. In theory, with repurposing, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need to design [new] drugs,&rdquo; Cohen avers. &ldquo;My feeling is that with 50 drugs, we can treat everything.&rdquo; That would mean changing yet another definition: the meaning of &ldquo;discovery.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the April 2019 issue of Fortune with the headline &ldquo;Finding New Cures in Old Drugs.&rdquo;</em></p>",

                "text": "In the elegant quiet of the caf\u00e9 at the Church of Sweden, a narrow Gothic-style building in Midtown Manhattan, Daniel Cohen is taking a break from explaining genetics. He moves toward the creaky piano positioned near the front door, sits down, and plays a flowing, flawless rendition of \u201cOver the Rainbow.\u201d\nIf human biology is the scientific equivalent of a complicated score, Cohen has learned how to navigate it like a virtuoso. Cohen was the driving force behind G\u00e9n\u00e9thon, the French laboratory that in December 1993 produced the first-ever \u201cmap\u201d of the human genome. He essentially introduced Big Data and automation to the study of genomics, as he and his team demonstrated for the first time that it was possible to use super-fast computing to speed up the processing of DNA samples.\nScientists worldwide have built on Cohen\u2019s insights, and Cohen himself, an MD with a Ph.D. in immunology, has gone on to success as a researcher and pharma executive. But a quarter-century later, genomics has yielded few of the kinds of paradigm-changing medical breakthroughs that many of its early innovators hoped for. Today, as chief executive and founder of Paris-based drug startup Pharnext, Cohen is striving to understand why that rainbow hasn\u2019t led to a pot of gold.\n\u201cAny protein in the body has many different functions, not only one,\u201d he says, returning from the piano to talk with me, \u201cjust as you are a person who has many functions in the population, not just one.\u201d The phenomenon Cohen is describing is \u201cpleiotropy,\u201d the capacity of a single gene to have multiple, seemingly unrelated effects. It is one of the complexities of disease that has repeatedly frustrated medical researchers in their quest for therapies for the most stubborn illnesses.\nCohen not only appreciates pleiotropy\u2019s significance: He believes that Pharnext and other drugmakers may soon exploit it\u2014with a powerful boost from artificial intelligence. By embracing the body\u2019s complexity, and by using A.I. to more methodically analyze and map the way the chain reactions of disease sweep through the body, he hopes to develop combinations of drugs tuned to attack a plethora of medical conditions.\nIn theory, with repurposing \u201cyou don\u2019t need to design new drugs,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cWith 50 drugs, we can treat everything.\u201d\nCohen and his team are also applying A.I. to search for therapies that leverage \u201crepurposing\u201d\u2014combining existing drugs in ways that give them therapeutic powers that each lacks in isolation. Their long-term goal is a drug pipeline that is far more efficient than Big Pharma\u2019s notoriously slow R&D departments\u2014streamlined by machine learning. Cohen\u2019s sleepy gaze widens with enthusiasm when he describes how it\u2019s all coming along. \u201cTr\u00e8s bien,\u201d he says. \u201cTr\u00e8s \u00e9conomique.\u201d\nRunning in the same race as Pharnext are companies ranging from giants like Google and IBM to startups such as Insilico Medicine, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and BenevolentAI. All are deeply invested in the tools of A.I., using them to analyze millions of examples of drug and patient data and tease out patterns of significance. But Pharnext, founded in 2007, predates most of those competitors by several years\u2014and has a longer head start when one factors in Cohen\u2019s decades of earlier research in genomics and pleiotropy.\nAnd perhaps most important, Pharnext\u2019s application of A.I. to medical problems over the course of more than a decade has finally reached a critical inflection point. In October, Pharnext reported positive results for a Phase III trial in humans of one of its drug combinations. The compound is PXT3003, a treatment for a neurodegenerative condition called Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a rare disorder for which no cure has been found. The primary cause of CMT is duplication of a single gene, but a whole cascade of bad things ensues \u201cdownstream\u201d from that mutation. Schwann cells, which protect nerves, regress into stem cells that don\u2019t do their job. Axons in the nerves begin to die off. Muscles can\u2019t be controlled, and they shrink as a consequence.\nAccording to Pharnext, its Phase III results (which have not yet been peer-reviewed) showed CMT not merely stabilizing under PXT3003 but also being reversed, as cells began regenerating. Previous treatments, Cohen says, had managed only to slow patients\u2019 decline. Under PXT3003, patients showed statistically significant improvement on two measures of disability. Based on those results, in February the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Pharnext \u201cfast track\u201d status for that therapy\u2014an accelerated review process, awarded only when the agency thinks a drug demonstrates \u201csuperior effectiveness\u201d in treating a serious disease.\nCourtesy of Pharnext\nIt is, to be sure, only one hopeful step against one rare ailment. Still, technology has shortened Pharnext\u2019s path in ways with promising long-term implications, shaving years off the drug-design timeline. Preclinical testing and clinical trials generally take eight to 10 years, and developing a novel drug completely from scratch can add seven years to the process, sometimes much more. In the case of PXT3003, in contrast, A.I. helped Pharnext select three existing drugs to repurpose: baclofen, a muscle relaxant; naltrexone, used to treat opioid dependence; and sorbitol, a glucose reduction used as a laxative. Because the drugs were already in use, Pharnext could skip the Phase I trials normally required to ensure their safety\u2014and eliminate the \u201cbuild from scratch\u201d stage.\nFDA fast-tracking increases the odds that PXT3003 could be on the market as soon as 2020\u2014and it\u2019s only one of Pharnext\u2019s many projects. The company will soon begin a second Phase II trial of a drug with indications for Alzheimer\u2019s and a first Phase II trial for an ALS therapy, in both cases using a similar repurposed combination.\nJust as important: If these experiments succeed, copycats with deeper pockets could follow suit. Kathleen Sebelius, a secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration who is now a consultant and board member for several health care companies, sees the efforts as part of a growing trend to repurpose. \u201cThat all leads to the possibility of a lot shorter investment cycle, and potentially a very different pricing point, and lots of possibilities for rare diseases where there just hasn\u2019t been enough of a financial incentive,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that has lots of appeal.\u201d Eric Kandel of the Kavli Institute for Brain Science at Columbia University, a winner of the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine who is an adviser to Pharnext, says that the startup is at the leading edge of the trend, calling its methodology \u201cboth original and powerful.\u201d As for whether that approach will catch on widely, Kandel adds, \u201cWe should know soon.\u201d\nAt the dawn of modern genetic research, almost no one anticipated the enormous complexity in the biology of disease. Many researchers thought the genome would be a kind of instruction manual for the body. Pioneers such as Celera Genomics\u2019 Craig Venter and Francis Collins of the National Institutes of Health were celebrated as \u201cgene hunters,\u201d a term that evoked crusaders scouring the globe for that one \u201csilver bullet\u201d gene that would explain\u2014and facilitate a cure for\u2014a given disease.\nTo some extent, these researchers found real treasure. Geneticist Nancy Wexler, for example, spent years in Venezuela compiling family trees of those affected by Huntington\u2019s disease, a rare, inherited condition. Her work led to the discovery of the mutation in a single gene that predicts whether an individual will contract the condition.\nBut scientists soon realized that genetic maps were less like an instruction manual and more like the parts catalog you get with Ikea furniture. What\u2019s more, researchers discovered other catalogs that added complex variables to the relationships between genes and disease\u2014for example, the proteome, the proteins encoded by DNA, and the transcriptome, all the nucleic acids that convert DNA into proteins.\nThe morning-after disappointment has proved wrenching, as researchers learned that complex diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s, didn\u2019t yield to a single gene. (Even Huntington\u2019s, its gene identified, has remained untreatable.) Today, Cohen and others see a link between the obsession with simplicity and a decline in drug discovery. That decline shows itself in the 1-in-10 success rate for FDA approval of new therapies; in spiraling costs for drug development (what a Tufts study recently identified as \u201cthe $2.6 billion pill\u201d); and in the soaring prices of the few treatments that break new ground, such as the $475,000 cost of a course of treatment with Novartis\u2019s leukemia drug Kymriah.\nMore recently, researchers have begun to grapple with biological complexity with the help of the science of networks. That science\u2019s chief evangelist is Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si, a professor at Northeastern University whose 2014 book Linked popularized the notion that network theory can explain numerous fields, from fashion trends to sexual relations to disease. Barab\u00e1si and others realized that disease is like a bad signal that moves through a network of connections from genes to proteins to cells to tissues, until all these \u201cperturbations\u201d manifest as the familiar symptoms of disease.\nECMTF2018/www.cmt-awareness.com\nComplicated diseases are confluences of numerous effects, because pleiotropy means that any given protein can act at different points in the body. Startups like Pharnext assume that drugs can also be pleiotropic, acting on more than one protein and more than one interaction in the body at the same time. To find a drug combination capable of tackling complexity, the enormous power of machine learning, with its ability to spot patterns in data, must be wedded to a sense of the structure by which disease operates.\nThis, in turn, has required an evolution in the relationship between computer scientists and biologists. Newer machine-learning approaches ingest vastly more data and can assemble hierarchies of information that let them go beyond correlation. Still, harnessing these \u201cdeep learning\u201d neural networks into a structure that has any predictive power requires some elegant algorithm-building.\nColin Hill, CEO and founder of GNS Healthcare, is one of the builders. His company, based in Cambridge, Mass., has spent 18 years developing a computer system called REFS, which stands for \u201creverse engineering, forward simulation.\u201d GNS has raised a total of $38 million over the years\u2014from Amgen Ventures, the venture capital arm of the drug giant, along with Celgene and a variety of other investors\u2014to build and fine-tune its models of disease. And in a recent series of trials, first published in 2017 in the medical journal The Lancet, GNS has detailed REFS\u2019s potential when applied to a disease such as Parkinson\u2019s\u2014an ailment in which pleiotropic factors render existing treatments wildly hit-or-miss in their effectiveness.\nWith Parkinson\u2019s, the network of interactions set in motion by defective genes has a particular shape to it, and the breakdown of motor functioning is the most reliable indication of its progression. Feeding the genetic data of Parkinson\u2019s sufferers and a control group into REFS helped GNS generate over 100 computer models depicting what might be going on as motor function deteriorates. The models can uncover previously unknown genetic mutations that may contribute to the speedup of deterioration.\nBut that\u2019s just the first part. GNS has used those findings to create 5,000 different computer simulations of randomized control trials, each aiming to predict how fast the disease would progress with varying approaches to treatment. Such speed-testing can be vastly more economical than seeking the same result through controlled human trials. And GNS, in partnership with other drugmakers, is now applying similar approaches to treatments for diabetes, ALS, multiple myeloma, and breast cancer, among other diseases.\n\u201cWe now have the ability to create and construct, on the computer, representations of human patients and their diseases such that we can now probe, drug by drug, care management intervention by care management intervention, and say what treatments work for which patient,\u201d says Colin Hill, CEO of GNS.\nThe simulation, in other words, is not just finding correlations: It is answering What if questions. What if we had given drug A instead of drug B to patient X? That ability to simulate and answer counterfactuals is a recent arrival in the practice of A.I. It owes its growing importance in large part to GNS\u2019s technology adviser, Judea Pearl, a longtime A.I. researcher and professor of computer science at UCLA. In a popular volume published last year called The Book of Why, Pearl describes how true intelligence ascends from merely noticing patterns, which machine learning does in spades, to being able to express counterfactual reasoning about what would have happened, based on those patterns. Data alone, disconnected from any idea of a mechanism, doesn\u2019t provide real insight. \u201cData is profoundly dumb about causality,\u201d claims Pearl. Hill puts it more bluntly: \u201cDeep learning is not that deep.\u201d\nDaniel Cohen, now 67, spent his childhood in Tunisia\u2019s heterogeneous society of Jews, Christians, Muslims, \u201cliving all together in a very elegant and pacific way.\u201d He credits that experience for his taste for \u201cthings that are not complicated, but complex.\u201d When he was 9, Cohen\u2019s family immigrated to Paris, where he pursued the piano avidly. He switched to medicine once he realized he might have a greater impact as a scientist than a musician, but the passion has not left him. He has been a guest conductor at the Royal Philharmonic in London and dreams of leading that ensemble in Tchaikovsky\u2019s Symphony Path\u00e9tique. \u201cThe predisposition to orchestra conductor, CEO, and scientist are all controlled by the same genes,\u201d he jokes.\nParlaying genomics and technology into pharmaceutical success is something Cohen has done before. He was a cofounder of Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a U.S. oncology-drug maker that helped develop the multiple-myeloma treatment Velcade.\nCohen is bullish that Pharnext can be successful with A.I., but he is also aware of the technology\u2019s limitations. Google\u2019s AlphaZero, an A.I. program, was able to beat the world\u2019s human masters at the Chinese strategy game Go, without using any prior human knowledge. But as Cohen points out, Go has a finite set of rules, which AlphaZero knew completely. In biology, thanks in part to pleiotropy, the rules are not fully known\u2014and may never be.\nPhotograph by Roberto Frankenberg for Fortune\nBut thoughtfully designed A.I. has enabled Pharnext to build models around the rules that are known and make choices accordingly. Out of the universe of 10,000 known drugs, the company\u2019s discovery model takes in an assortment of 2,000 that are both out of patent and \u201cmarketed\u201d\u2014that is, already judged both therapeutically effective and safe enough to be sold to the public.\nTo develop its CMT drug, Pharnext first spent about a year assembling its network model for the disease\u2014a framework comparable to GNS\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s map, showing how nervous and muscular problems \u201ccascade\u201d from the relevant gene mutation. Based on this mechanism, the computer model arrived at a short list of 57 candidate drugs that addressed various points in the cascade. Pharnext tested those drugs one by one in vitro, generating a shorter list of 22 to be tested in mice, which finally yielded the three-drug combination that went to human clinical trials. The recent positive Phase III results confirmed that the PXT3003 cocktail is acting at various points in the cascade.\nWithout the A.I. model, many more years of preclinical testing would have been required beyond the three years it took Pharnext, says Cohen. \u201cWith 2,000 drugs [to start with], I could produce all possible combinations, a billion possibilities\u201d to test in vitro. That\u2019s a recipe for countless false positives and dead ends\u2014years of frustration, for now forestalled.\nPharnext\u2019s shares, which trade on the Paris stock exchange, have more than doubled since October\u2019s Phase III results announcement. The company has spent about 120 million euros ($135 million) over the past decade on research and development\u2014a very modest figure by pharma standards. It has never made a profit, but analysts estimate that if PXT3003 reaches the market, revenue\u20149 million euros in 2018\u2014could soar starting in 2020. (GNS Healthcare is privately held and does not disclose spending or revenue.)\nBeyond possible victories for investors, the advances at Pharnext and GNS point the way to A.I.\u2019s growing up\u2014and pharmacology along with it. The ability to reason about causality, and to explore counterfactual questions, is a threshold that users of artificial intelligence have long sought to cross. The computer models at these startups are making a foray in that direction as they manage and tame a bewildering number of variables.\nEven the underlying definition of disease may evolve. As scientists are learning, these definitions have been overly simplistic. A study in the journal Bioinformatics last year noted that attempts to treat tumors are hampered by the fact that genetic mutations in cancer are \u201cfundamentally heterogeneous\u201d: What appears as one disease, or class of disease, in fact contains few commonalities and many differences from patient to patient. As it becomes clear that what\u2019s happening in any body differs sharply from the \u201con/off\u201d model of one gene turning on a set of symptoms, technology can help drug developers wrestle with the complexity.\nLast, but hardly least, these A.I.-driven efforts offer a glimmer of economic hope. In an era in which the cost of drug development is a daunting obstacle, smart algorithms may someday enable medical stakeholders to derive more value from the trillions of dollars that have already been spent on drug research. In theory, with repurposing, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to design [new] drugs,\u201d Cohen avers. \u201cMy feeling is that with 50 drugs, we can treat everything.\u201d That would mean changing yet another definition: the meaning of \u201cdiscovery.\u201d\nA version of this article appears in the April 2019 issue of Fortune with the headline \u201cFinding New Cures in Old Drugs.\u201d",

The main concern is that Pyongyang could yet again wrangle its way out of real steps to denuclearize&mdash;an issue that has vexed top U.S. diplomats in decades past. Top U.S. intelligence chiefs say North Korea is unlikely to dismantle its nuclear program, and working-level negotiations since Trump and Kim&rsquo;s first summit last year in Singapore sputtered and stalled.</p>\n<p>In South Korea, President Moon Jae-in has forged an unusually close relationship with Kim in his bid to repair ties between the two countries, holding bilateral meetings that often end with photo-ops of the two leaders hugging and smiling.</p>\n<p>Japan, meanwhile, must channel its top-level engagement with North Korea through either Seoul or Washington, as Pyongyang has yet to respond to Tokyo&rsquo;s diplomatic overtures. This often leaves Abe caught between the mercurial North Korean strongman and the brash, free-wheeling U.S. president, who has a penchant for going off script and spurning the advice of his top advisors.</p>\n<p>Some experts stress that Japan is in a strong diplomatic position, given Abe&rsquo;s personal relationship with Trump and despite North Korea&rsquo;s refusal to engage with him. But Abe is still forced to watch Hanoi from the sidelines.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In talking with Japanese officials, they do feel concerned. They do feel isolated,&rdquo; said Bruce Klingner, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation and former CIA deputy division chief for Korea. And when it comes to the U.S. president, Klingner said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re wary of surprises.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump has given them a reason to worry.</p>\n<p>After his first summit with Kim, in 2018, the president unilaterally announced he would end some joint military exercises with South Korea, jolting allies and even some in his own Defense Department.</p>\n<p>In December 2018, Trump surprised U.S. allies again by announcing he was withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria and many forces from Afghanistan. The decision to pull all U.S. troops from Syria (which is now being reconsidered) prompted Trump&rsquo;s defense secretary, James Mattis, and his top counter-Islamic State envoy, Brett McGurk, to resign.</p>\n<p>The surprise announcements on Syria and Afghanistan reverberated throughout East Asia and rattled the nerves of U.S. allies, according to Jung Pak, the chair in Korea studies at the Brookings Institution. What&rsquo;s left for U.S. allies in the region, she said, is &ldquo;a tangled web of insecurities, hedging, of frustrations that I think emanate in part from President Trump&rsquo;s unpredictability.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Japan remains heavily reliant on its alliance with the United States given China&rsquo;s rising military threat and North Korea&rsquo;s stubborn development of nuclear and missile programs. Japan&rsquo;s pacifist constitution, created after World War II, restricts military use to purely defensive actions, though Abe&rsquo;s government is pushing to reform the constitution and transform Japan&rsquo;s Self-Defense Forces into a full-service military.</p>\n<p>All that leaves Japan particularly susceptible to the whims of president who has spurned traditional alliance structures and questioned longstanding U.S. global commitments.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a prevalent fear in Tokyo that Trump could strike a deal with Kim that wards off a threat to the United States while leaving regional allies in the lurch, according to Hiroyuki Akita, a commentator for the Japanese news outlet <i>Nikkei</i>. This hypothetical deal could include limits on North Korean intercontinental ballistic missiles but stop short of achieving denuclearization and addressing short- and medium-range missiles that threaten Japan but not the U.S. mainland. &ldquo;That is a nightmare scenario for Japan,&rdquo; Akita said.</p>\n<p>Depending on what deal comes out of Hanoi, Japan&rsquo;s precarious situation could become starker, said Naoko Aoki, a fellow at the Rand Corp. As one potential outcome from the Trump-Kim summit, U.S. negotiators have floated setting up a liaison office in North Korea in a step toward normalizing diplomatic relations&mdash;though the office would fall well short of a full-fledged embassy. Other major players in the region, including Russia and China, have embassies in Pyongyang, while South Korea established its own liaison office with North Korea last September.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That would mean Japan would be the only major country [in the region] without a presence or diplomatic channel that could be used between the two countries,&rdquo; Aoki said.</p>\n<p>Japan has reached out to North Korea several times, according to Japanese officials and experts. That includes contacts at the sidelines of the 2018 U.N. General Assembly, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono&rsquo;s meeting with North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in August 2018, and reported talks between their respective intelligence agencies.</p>\n<p>But those talks do not appear to have led to &ldquo;anything of substance,&rdquo; Aoki said.</p>\n<p>Some experts push back on the notion that Japan is isolated going into the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi, including Sheila Smith of the Council on Foreign Relations. She cited recent trips both Trump and Pompeo have made to Tokyo and phone conversations with their Japanese counterparts to coordinate on North Korea negotiations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are always on the same page [with the U.S.] about the question of denuclearization,&rdquo; insisted another senior Japanese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>\n<p>After North Korea fired test missiles over Japan in 2017, Abe&rsquo;s government worked effectively to marshal an international response, including at the United Nations, Smith said. &ldquo;Japan remains very active on the global stage.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s unclear whether Trump and Abe&rsquo;s personal rapport will factor into Trump&rsquo;s negotiations in Hanoi. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of the extent [Abe&rsquo;s] personal relationship will be effective enough to prevent Mr. Trump from making an unfavorable deal for Japan,&rdquo; Akita said.</p>\n<p>Abe has insisted any direct meeting with Kim would have to address Japanese citizens who North Korea abducted in the 1970s and 1980s. Officially, North Korea recognized it abducted 17 Japanese nationals, though the actual number is unclear. It remains one of the most politically important and emotionally fraught foreign-policy issues for Japan. The last major breakthrough on the issue was in 2002, when North Korea admitted to the abductions and released five abductees, though the fate of the remaining 12 remains uncertain&ndash;including whether they are still alive. But any breakthrough on this could open economic development from Japan, sorely needed in North Korea.</p>\n<p>Abe, now the fourth-longest-ruling prime minister in Japan&rsquo;s history, has championed the abductee issue throughout his political career. He has made clear he wants to resolve the issue once and for all to clinch his foreign-policy legacy. But Japanese officials quietly concede that can&rsquo;t be done through intermediaries in Washington or Seoul.</p>\n<p>Sue Mi Terry, an expert on the region with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in North Korea&rsquo;s eyes, the abduction issue has taken a backseat to rapprochement with Seoul and Washington. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed. That&rsquo;s just not a priority for Kim right now,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Smith said any meeting between Abe and Kim would have to address these substantive issues.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t just be a summit and a photo-op.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><i>Reporting was conducted with a fellowship program to Japan organized by Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA.</i></p>",

                "text": "At the United Nations General Assembly in September 2018, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared he was ready to \u201cbreak the shell of mutual distrust\u201d with North Korea and have his own summit with its leader, Kim Jong Un.\nBut since then, amid the frenzied pace of summitry\u2014the United States and North Korea, South Korea and North Korea, China and North Korea\u2014Japan is still looking on from the sidelines, wary that U.S. President Donald Trump might strike a deal without consulting Tokyo.\nTrump\u2019s Nigerian Ban Is About Race, Not Security\nNigerian entrepreneurship and creativity have always found a home in the United States\u2014until now.\nThat Abe, long a hard-liner on North Korea, hasn\u2019t clinched his own summit with Pyongyang reflects the precarious position Japan finds itself in as Trump prepares this week for his second meeting with Kim, experts and officials say.\n\u201cIn Japan, rather than hoping for something good to happen, people are hoping for something bad not to happen,\u201d said one Japanese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nAt their summit in Vietnam, Trump and Kim will discuss potential North Korean concessions on nuclear disarmament. Allies quietly fear that Kim could outmaneuver Trump in his drive to secure a political and PR victory (and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reportedly shares those fears). The main concern is that Pyongyang could yet again wrangle its way out of real steps to denuclearize\u2014an issue that has vexed top U.S. diplomats in decades past. Top U.S. intelligence chiefs say North Korea is unlikely to dismantle its nuclear program, and working-level negotiations since Trump and Kim\u2019s first summit last year in Singapore sputtered and stalled.\nIn South Korea, President Moon Jae-in has forged an unusually close relationship with Kim in his bid to repair ties between the two countries, holding bilateral meetings that often end with photo-ops of the two leaders hugging and smiling.\nJapan, meanwhile, must channel its top-level engagement with North Korea through either Seoul or Washington, as Pyongyang has yet to respond to Tokyo\u2019s diplomatic overtures. This often leaves Abe caught between the mercurial North Korean strongman and the brash, free-wheeling U.S. president, who has a penchant for going off script and spurning the advice of his top advisors.\nSome experts stress that Japan is in a strong diplomatic position, given Abe\u2019s personal relationship with Trump and despite North Korea\u2019s refusal to engage with him. But Abe is still forced to watch Hanoi from the sidelines.\n\u201cIn talking with Japanese officials, they do feel concerned. They do feel isolated,\u201d said Bruce Klingner, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation and former CIA deputy division chief for Korea. And when it comes to the U.S. president, Klingner said, \u201cthey\u2019re wary of surprises.\u201d\nTrump has given them a reason to worry.\nAfter his first summit with Kim, in 2018, the president unilaterally announced he would end some joint military exercises with South Korea, jolting allies and even some in his own Defense Department.\nIn December 2018, Trump surprised U.S. allies again by announcing he was withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria and many forces from Afghanistan. The decision to pull all U.S. troops from Syria (which is now being reconsidered) prompted Trump\u2019s defense secretary, James Mattis, and his top counter-Islamic State envoy, Brett McGurk, to resign.\nThe surprise announcements on Syria and Afghanistan reverberated throughout East Asia and rattled the nerves of U.S. allies, according to Jung Pak, the chair in Korea studies at the Brookings Institution. What\u2019s left for U.S. allies in the region, she said, is \u201ca tangled web of insecurities, hedging, of frustrations that I think emanate in part from President Trump\u2019s unpredictability.\u201d\nJapan remains heavily reliant on its alliance with the United States given China\u2019s rising military threat and North Korea\u2019s stubborn development of nuclear and missile programs. Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution, created after World War II, restricts military use to purely defensive actions, though Abe\u2019s government is pushing to reform the constitution and transform Japan\u2019s Self-Defense Forces into a full-service military.\nAll that leaves Japan particularly susceptible to the whims of president who has spurned traditional alliance structures and questioned longstanding U.S. global commitments.\nThere\u2019s a prevalent fear in Tokyo that Trump could strike a deal with Kim that wards off a threat to the United States while leaving regional allies in the lurch, according to Hiroyuki Akita, a commentator for the Japanese news outlet Nikkei. This hypothetical deal could include limits on North Korean intercontinental ballistic missiles but stop short of achieving denuclearization and addressing short- and medium-range missiles that threaten Japan but not the U.S. mainland. \u201cThat is a nightmare scenario for Japan,\u201d Akita said.\nDepending on what deal comes out of Hanoi, Japan\u2019s precarious situation could become starker, said Naoko Aoki, a fellow at the Rand Corp. As one potential outcome from the Trump-Kim summit, U.S. negotiators have floated setting up a liaison office in North Korea in a step toward normalizing diplomatic relations\u2014though the office would fall well short of a full-fledged embassy. Other major players in the region, including Russia and China, have embassies in Pyongyang, while South Korea established its own liaison office with North Korea last September.\n\u201cThat would mean Japan would be the only major country [in the region] without a presence or diplomatic channel that could be used between the two countries,\u201d Aoki said.\nJapan has reached out to North Korea several times, according to Japanese officials and experts. That includes contacts at the sidelines of the 2018 U.N. General Assembly, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono\u2019s meeting with North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in August 2018, and reported talks between their respective intelligence agencies.\nBut those talks do not appear to have led to \u201canything of substance,\u201d Aoki said.\nSome experts push back on the notion that Japan is isolated going into the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi, including Sheila Smith of the Council on Foreign Relations. She cited recent trips both Trump and Pompeo have made to Tokyo and phone conversations with their Japanese counterparts to coordinate on North Korea negotiations.\n\u201cWe are always on the same page [with the U.S.] about the question of denuclearization,\u201d insisted another senior Japanese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nAfter North Korea fired test missiles over Japan in 2017, Abe\u2019s government worked effectively to marshal an international response, including at the United Nations, Smith said. \u201cJapan remains very active on the global stage.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether Trump and Abe\u2019s personal rapport will factor into Trump\u2019s negotiations in Hanoi. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure of the extent [Abe\u2019s] personal relationship will be effective enough to prevent Mr. Trump from making an unfavorable deal for Japan,\u201d Akita said.\nAbe has insisted any direct meeting with Kim would have to address Japanese citizens who North Korea abducted in the 1970s and 1980s. Officially, North Korea recognized it abducted 17 Japanese nationals, though the actual number is unclear. It remains one of the most politically important and emotionally fraught foreign-policy issues for Japan. The last major breakthrough on the issue was in 2002, when North Korea admitted to the abductions and released five abductees, though the fate of the remaining 12 remains uncertain\u2013including whether they are still alive. But any breakthrough on this could open economic development from Japan, sorely needed in North Korea.\nAbe, now the fourth-longest-ruling prime minister in Japan\u2019s history, has championed the abductee issue throughout his political career. He has made clear he wants to resolve the issue once and for all to clinch his foreign-policy legacy. But Japanese officials quietly concede that can\u2019t be done through intermediaries in Washington or Seoul.\nSue Mi Terry, an expert on the region with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in North Korea\u2019s eyes, the abduction issue has taken a backseat to rapprochement with Seoul and Washington. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. That\u2019s just not a priority for Kim right now,\u201d she said.\nSmith said any meeting between Abe and Kim would have to address these substantive issues.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t just be a summit and a photo-op.\u201d\nReporting was conducted with a fellowship program to Japan organized by Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA.",

Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and several other campaign advisors has been convicted of fraud or other crimes, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn has been convicted of lying to the FBI, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/05/politics/scott-pruitt-epa-resigns/index.html\">Scott Pruitt</a> and Interior Secretary <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/interior-secretary-zinke-resigns-amid-investigations/2018/12/15/481f9104-0077-11e9-ad40-cdfd0e0dd65a_story.html\">Ryan Zinke</a> both resigned over ethics violations. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta is under fire for the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/jeffrey-epstein-acosta-florida-sex-abuse.html\">plea deal</a> he gave the wealthy and well-connected accused sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein back when Acosta was a U.S. attorney in Florida, and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross continues to serve <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/6/20/17479170/wilbur-ross-corruption\">despite serious conflicts of interest.</a></p>\n<p>Instead of fulfilling his campaign promise to &ldquo;drain the swamp,&rdquo; Trump dug it wider and filled it deeper. Small wonder that the United States has fallen out of the ranks of the top 20 &ldquo;least corrupt&rdquo; nations&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/cpi2018\">according to</a> the watchdog group Transparency International&mdash;and is now considered a &ldquo;country to watch&rdquo; by that nonpartisan organization.</p>\n<p>But the problem is in fact far more serious than Trump and his entourage. Consider some other recent scandals.</p>\n<p><em>Example #1: The 2008 Financial Crisis. </em>To some extent, the 2008 financial crisis is a case study of hubris, where self-styled &ldquo;masters of the universe&rdquo; convinced themselves they had <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8973.html\">devised financial instruments</a> that had reduced the risk of a panic to miniscule levels. But the crisis also exposed systemic corruption inside key financial institutions. It wasn&rsquo;t just a few crooked mortgage brokers offering lots of bad loans; it also involved serious abuses by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/21/standard-poors-to-pay-fine-banned-rating-mortgage-securities-one-year\">ratings agencies</a>, investment banks, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reckless-Endangerment-Outsized-Corruption-Armageddon/dp/B0085RZF5K\">government-backed lenders</a> like Fannie Mae, and even <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203436904577148940410667970\">some academic economists</a>. At least we can take comfort in the fact that the people responsible for cratering the world economy were held accountable and got punished, right? <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/how-wall-streets-bankers-stayed-out-of-jail/399368/\">Er, nope. </a></p>\n<p><em>Example #2: The Boeing 737 Max. </em>The more we learn about the second recent crash of a Boeing 737 Max aircraft, the more disturbing the tale becomes. While a final determination of the causes of the two recent crashes has yet to be made, it seems increasingly clear that Boeing rushed the new plane to market, downplayed the need for additional pilot training, and used an <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/faa-boeing-relationship-deadly-plane-crashes\">increasingly cozy relationship</a> with Federal Aviation Administration regulators to win approval for the plane. The world seems to have woken up to the conflicts of interest here: The United States was the last country to <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/15/how-the-737-max-series-went-wheels-down-all-over-the-world/\">ground</a> the plane after this month&rsquo;s crash, and Ethiopian authorities chose to send the black boxes for analysis <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/03/ethiopian-airlines-737-max-black-box-sent-to-paris-why.html\">in France</a> rather than in <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/c85260a47b9d4495802d7024e511cca8\">the United States</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Example #3: The (Latest) College Admissions Scandal.</em> It&rsquo;s no secret that admission to elite institutions of higher education isn&rsquo;t the pure meritocracy that universities try to convey. Being part of an alumni family (a &ldquo;legacy&rdquo;) is <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/btl/files/michael_hurwitz_-_qp_12-12-09.pdf\">a big plus,</a> and it seems to help a lot if a parent gives the school a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-story-behind-jared-kushners-curious-acceptance-into-harvard\">big donation</a> at just the right time. But <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/us/college-admissions-cheating-scandal.html?module=inline&login=email&auth=login-email\">last week&rsquo;s revelations</a> that wealthy parents and celebrities were colluding with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/us/william-rick-singer-admissions-scandal.html\">William Singer</a> (a professional &ldquo;admissions counselor&rdquo;) and a bunch of corrupt coaches and administrators to get their less-than-fully-qualified kids into elite schools by falsifying test results or passing them off as gifted athletes was still an eye-opener. It was also more evidence&mdash;as if any were needed&mdash;of the corrupting role big-time athletics play in the life of American universities. Don&rsquo;t even get me started on <em>that </em>subject.</p>\n<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget that a number of venerated institutions in American life&mdash;including the military and the clergy&mdash;have been rocked by serious scandals over the past several decades. In addition to the horrifying history of sexual predation and cover-ups in the Catholic Church, the U.S. military has been wrestling with a serious problem <a href=\"https://dod.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1508127/dod-releases-annual-report-on-sexual-assault-in-military/\">of sexual assault</a> in the ranks, a wide-ranging <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/11/6/16614262/fat-leonard-navy-scandal\">procurement scandal</a> that rocked the U.S. Navy, and the discovery in 2014 that 34 missile launch control officers <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2014/03/12/289423404/ex-missile-crew-members-say-cheating-is-part-of-the-culture\">conspired</a> to falsify scores on proficiency exams. What these and other episodes reminds us is that corruption isn&rsquo;t confined to the current White House, to a few bad apples like Bernie Madoff, or to a handful of industries with unsavory reputations (like real estate). On the contrary, it seems to be a growing problem in all walks of life.</p>\n<p>Why does this matter? For starters, corruption is inherently inefficient. Instead of resources going where they are most needed, they get diverted into bribes, payoffs, kickbacks, and other shady arrangements. And when the wealthy and powerful use connections to get jobs or contracts (or to get their kids into college), that means that more deserving and talented people get excluded and less qualified people end up in positions of authority. The more common such practices become, the more honest and law-abiding people will be tempted to follow suit just to keep up. And once corruption becomes endemic in a society, rooting it out becomes difficult if not impossible.</p>\n<p>Making matters worse is the demand for regulation that corruption tends to foster. When more and more people cheat and trust erodes, responsible officials will try to corral corruption by imposing more rules, laws, oversight procedures, and regulatory mechanisms. One sees this phenomenon everywhere&mdash;including at universities&mdash;where efforts to prevent all sorts of misconduct are making it nearly impossible to do anything efficiently. But the taproot of this problem is the fear that we cannot trust anyone to act properly without strict guidance and suffocating levels of bureaucratic oversight. Sadly, such fears are far from groundless.</p>\n<p>Corruption and other forms of elite malfeasance also nourish populist anger. When elites go to great lengths to game the system and are increasingly seen as out of touch and unaccountable, it is hardly surprising that ordinary people who have been playing by the rules become so angry that they will put their faith in anyone who promises to shake up the system. Such sentiments help explain the otherwise surprising popularity of a candidate like Bernie Sanders or the rapid rise of straight-talking politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Ironically, it also played a key role in Trump&rsquo;s 2016 presidential campaign, which proved that if you can fake integrity, you&rsquo;ve got it made.</p>\n<p>Over the longer term, rising corruption threatens America&rsquo;s soft power, and especially its reputation for competence. Other countries are more likely to follow America&rsquo;s lead when they believe the core institutions of U.S. society are run by people who know what they are doing, and when foreign governments have confidence that the information provided by U.S. officials is accurate. But when grifters rule the roost and privileged elites use their current positions to hog even more for themselves, their offspring, and their cronies, our core institutions will function poorly and other states will lose confidence in our ability to deliver as promised.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the United States still ranks relatively low on most indices of corruption, and it is a far cry from those <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2019/02/08/most-corrupt-countries-in-the-world/#d2567db57bb4\">unfortunate places</a> where corrupt practices are almost a way of life. But we Americans are not nearly as pure as we pretend, or as concerned about the problem as we ought to be. And as long as Donald J. Trump is alligator-in-chief, life in the swamp will go on as before.</p>",

                "text": "If they\u2019ve been paying attention, Americans have received some rude wake-up calls in recent years. What unpleasant news do these messages convey? The country is a lot more corrupt than Americans realized.\nSince 2016, of course, concern for corruption has been riveted on the sleaze show that is the Trump administration. As the New York Times revealed last fall in a remarkable investigative report, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s life since boyhood has rested on assorted frauds, tax scams, and shady business dealings, and his recent conduct suggests high office did not alter the family\u2019s modus operandi.\nTrump\u2019s Nigerian Ban Is About Race, Not Security\nSince becoming president, Trump has breezily ignored the emoluments clause of the Constitution, handed taxpayers a multimillion-dollar bill for his frequent trips to his own properties, appointed his daughter and son-in-law to sensitive positions for which they are manifestly unqualified, and surrounded himself with a host of shady characters. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and several other campaign advisors has been convicted of fraud or other crimes, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn has been convicted of lying to the FBI, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke both resigned over ethics violations. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta is under fire for the plea deal he gave the wealthy and well-connected accused sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein back when Acosta was a U.S. attorney in Florida, and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross continues to serve despite serious conflicts of interest.\nInstead of fulfilling his campaign promise to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d Trump dug it wider and filled it deeper. Small wonder that the United States has fallen out of the ranks of the top 20 \u201cleast corrupt\u201d nations\u2014according to the watchdog group Transparency International\u2014and is now considered a \u201ccountry to watch\u201d by that nonpartisan organization.\nBut the problem is in fact far more serious than Trump and his entourage. Consider some other recent scandals.\nExample #1: The 2008 Financial Crisis. To some extent, the 2008 financial crisis is a case study of hubris, where self-styled \u201cmasters of the universe\u201d convinced themselves they had devised financial instruments that had reduced the risk of a panic to miniscule levels. But the crisis also exposed systemic corruption inside key financial institutions. It wasn\u2019t just a few crooked mortgage brokers offering lots of bad loans; it also involved serious abuses by ratings agencies, investment banks, government-backed lenders like Fannie Mae, and even some academic economists. At least we can take comfort in the fact that the people responsible for cratering the world economy were held accountable and got punished, right? Er, nope.\nExample #2: The Boeing 737 Max. The more we learn about the second recent crash of a Boeing 737 Max aircraft, the more disturbing the tale becomes. While a final determination of the causes of the two recent crashes has yet to be made, it seems increasingly clear that Boeing rushed the new plane to market, downplayed the need for additional pilot training, and used an increasingly cozy relationship with Federal Aviation Administration regulators to win approval for the plane. The world seems to have woken up to the conflicts of interest here: The United States was the last country to ground the plane after this month\u2019s crash, and Ethiopian authorities chose to send the black boxes for analysis in France rather than in the United States.\nExample #3: The (Latest) College Admissions Scandal. It\u2019s no secret that admission to elite institutions of higher education isn\u2019t the pure meritocracy that universities try to convey. Being part of an alumni family (a \u201clegacy\u201d) is a big plus, and it seems to help a lot if a parent gives the school a big donation at just the right time. But last week\u2019s revelations that wealthy parents and celebrities were colluding with William Singer (a professional \u201cadmissions counselor\u201d) and a bunch of corrupt coaches and administrators to get their less-than-fully-qualified kids into elite schools by falsifying test results or passing them off as gifted athletes was still an eye-opener. It was also more evidence\u2014as if any were needed\u2014of the corrupting role big-time athletics play in the life of American universities. Don\u2019t even get me started on that subject.\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that a number of venerated institutions in American life\u2014including the military and the clergy\u2014have been rocked by serious scandals over the past several decades. In addition to the horrifying history of sexual predation and cover-ups in the Catholic Church, the U.S. military has been wrestling with a serious problem of sexual assault in the ranks, a wide-ranging procurement scandal that rocked the U.S. Navy, and the discovery in 2014 that 34 missile launch control officers conspired to falsify scores on proficiency exams. What these and other episodes reminds us is that corruption isn\u2019t confined to the current White House, to a few bad apples like Bernie Madoff, or to a handful of industries with unsavory reputations (like real estate). On the contrary, it seems to be a growing problem in all walks of life.\nWhy does this matter? For starters, corruption is inherently inefficient. Instead of resources going where they are most needed, they get diverted into bribes, payoffs, kickbacks, and other shady arrangements. And when the wealthy and powerful use connections to get jobs or contracts (or to get their kids into college), that means that more deserving and talented people get excluded and less qualified people end up in positions of authority. The more common such practices become, the more honest and law-abiding people will be tempted to follow suit just to keep up. And once corruption becomes endemic in a society, rooting it out becomes difficult if not impossible.\nMaking matters worse is the demand for regulation that corruption tends to foster. When more and more people cheat and trust erodes, responsible officials will try to corral corruption by imposing more rules, laws, oversight procedures, and regulatory mechanisms. One sees this phenomenon everywhere\u2014including at universities\u2014where efforts to prevent all sorts of misconduct are making it nearly impossible to do anything efficiently. But the taproot of this problem is the fear that we cannot trust anyone to act properly without strict guidance and suffocating levels of bureaucratic oversight. Sadly, such fears are far from groundless.\nCorruption and other forms of elite malfeasance also nourish populist anger. When elites go to great lengths to game the system and are increasingly seen as out of touch and unaccountable, it is hardly surprising that ordinary people who have been playing by the rules become so angry that they will put their faith in anyone who promises to shake up the system. Such sentiments help explain the otherwise surprising popularity of a candidate like Bernie Sanders or the rapid rise of straight-talking politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Ironically, it also played a key role in Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, which proved that if you can fake integrity, you\u2019ve got it made.\nOver the longer term, rising corruption threatens America\u2019s soft power, and especially its reputation for competence. Other countries are more likely to follow America\u2019s lead when they believe the core institutions of U.S. society are run by people who know what they are doing, and when foreign governments have confidence that the information provided by U.S. officials is accurate. But when grifters rule the roost and privileged elites use their current positions to hog even more for themselves, their offspring, and their cronies, our core institutions will function poorly and other states will lose confidence in our ability to deliver as promised.\nTo be sure, the United States still ranks relatively low on most indices of corruption, and it is a far cry from those unfortunate places where corrupt practices are almost a way of life. But we Americans are not nearly as pure as we pretend, or as concerned about the problem as we ought to be. And as long as Donald J. Trump is alligator-in-chief, life in the swamp will go on as before.",

The following day, one of Stefanovic&rsquo;s allies, Dragan Djilas, told reporters that Vucic was &ldquo;the main culprit&rdquo; behind the assault. The first demonstration was held in Krusevac a week later under the banner of &ldquo;Stop the Bloody Shirts&rdquo; and was organized by the Alliance for Serbia, a coalition of various opposition parties that includes the Serbian Left and spans the entire breadth of the country&rsquo;s political spectrum.</p>\n<p>The inaugural Belgrade protest took place the following weekend and was organized independently of the opposition alliance by a group of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN1jNSqB-Nc&t=36s\">students</a> from the University of Political Sciences. The assault on Stefanovic might have been the spark that lit the fuse, but the protesters took aim at a much greater foe than his attackers: Their target was the government in its entirety and Vucic himself, whom they blame for the deteriorating political conditions in the country. The protesters elicited a typically pigheaded response from the president, who claimed that he would not give into their demands, &ldquo;even if there were 5 million people in the streets.&rdquo; This was quickly adopted as their slogan: &ldquo;One in 5 Million&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Although temperatures in the Balkans are rising, neither budding flowers nor mass protests should be mistaken for the beginning of a Balkan Spring modeled on the revolutions that rocked the Arab world in 2011.</p>\n<blockquote>Although temperatures in the Balkans are rising, neither budding flowers nor mass protests should be mistaken for the beginning of a Balkan Spring modeled on the revolutions that rocked the Arab world in 2011.</blockquote>\n<p>Vucic has, lest we forget, seen out mass protests before, following his 2017 presidential election victory, when he finished 38 points ahead of his nearest competitor. For nearly two full months, citizens took to the street on an almost daily basis to protest &ldquo;against the dictatorship,&rdquo; as they called it. By the end of May the demonstrations had largely <a href=\"http://rs.n1info.com/Vesti/a252424/Protest-protiv-diktature-ispred-Skupstine.html\">fizzled</a> out.</p>\n<p>The protesters opposed Vucic and his hegemonic rule, but they could offer no alternative. Only one opposition figure, the former ombudsman Sasa Jankovic, won more votes than <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcLdW7K86Gg\">a spoof candidate</a> who promised to build Serbia a coastline. Then, like now, the protesters lacked a serious strategy that would allow them to achieve their aims. They could mobilize a crowd, but they lacked a clearly defined path to victory, and it was inevitable that this aimlessness would eventually cause them to run out of steam.</p>\n<p>Today&rsquo;s protesters have improved on their 2017 predecessors by setting out several concrete demands: They&rsquo;ve called for the resignations of the interior minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic (a right-hand man Vucic frequently uses as an attack dog in public debates), and the health minister, Zlatibor Loncar (who allowed Vucic to pose for a hospital ward photo-op with critically ill children during a flu epidemic without wearing the appropriate medical attire and, critics allege, putting the children&rsquo;s health at risk), as well as <a href=\"http://rs.n1info.com/Vesti/a466689/Protest-1-od-5-miliona-u-Beogradu-9.-marta.html\">two senior figures</a> at Radio Television Serbia, which is often accused of being a government mouthpiece. Protesters have also called for convictions in the unsolved 2018 assassination of Oliver Ivanovic, a Kosovo Serb politician and outspoken Vucic critic who had been a thorn in the side of the government, particularly when it came to denouncing organized crime. But it&rsquo;s still unclear how they plan to extract these concessions.</p>\n<p>The protesters&rsquo; main problem is that they&rsquo;re unable to apply any political pressure on the government by rallying around a candidate that might threaten Vucic&rsquo;s stranglehold on national politics.</p>\n<blockquote>The protesters&rsquo; main problem is that they&rsquo;re unable to apply any political pressure on the government by rallying around a candidate that might threaten Vucic&rsquo;s stranglehold on national politics.</blockquote>\n<p>Although the Alliance for Serbia has tried its hardest to attach itself to the protests, the weekly demonstrations aren&rsquo;t formally affiliated with any single opposition party or political figure. The entirety of the anti-Vucic ideological spectrum is represented&mdash;from student Marxists to Bosko Obradovic, the ultranationalist leader of Dveri, a far-right opposition party of religious conservatives&mdash;sometimes causing scuffles among the protesters. This highlights the fragmented and impotent nature of the Serbian opposition, which is united by its opposition to Vucic but unable to agree on much else.</p>\n<p>The anti-Vucic movement is also hamstrung by the fact that all the opposition alternatives are deeply divisive and unpopular. The aforementioned Obradovic is a homophobe whose party opposes EU membership and wants to orientate the country towards Russia. In the 2017 election, Obradovic took 2.28 percent of the vote&mdash;four times less than the spoof candidate, Ljubisa &ldquo;Beli&rdquo; Preletacevic (a pseudonym for Luka Maksimovic who campaigned in character as Beli).</p>\n<p>Dveri currently holds the presidency of the Alliance for Serbia. The coalition was founded by Djilas, Belgrade&rsquo;s former mayor and a key figure in the discredited Democratic Party that dominated Serbian politics between the overthrow of Milosevic and Vucic&rsquo;s breakthrough 12 years later. Djilas, like other Democratic Party top brass, is widely perceived to have used his time in office to enrich himself by advancing his private business interests. Borko Stefanovic, whose beating triggered the protests, is also a Democratic Party alumnus. He served as chief negotiator in the 2008 sale of state petroleum company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), to Russia&rsquo;s Gazprom Neft.</p>\n<p>The deal caused outrage for its closed tendering process and a final sale price that came out to only a fifth of NIS&rsquo;s market value at the time. Many see it as a prime example of the crooked privatizations that followed Yugoslavia&rsquo;s disintegration&mdash;and Vucic&rsquo;s government launched an investigation into the sale in 2014. It&rsquo;s deeply ironic and profoundly cynical that someone involved in the hawking of state assets now leads a party that bills itself as &ldquo;Left.&rdquo; Borko Stefanovic and his sometime Democratic Party colleagues need to shoulder some of the blame for the country&rsquo;s current political malaise, because it was their failures in office that drove a disillusioned electorate into the arms of Vucic&rsquo;s party.</p>\n<p>This considered, it should come as little surprise that the Serbian electorate remains unconvinced by the alternatives. My own grandfather is a reluctant Vucic voter who frequently complains about cuts to his pension. When I ask him why he continues to back the ruling Progressive Party, he responds with a shrug: &ldquo;Who else am I going to vote for? Djilas? As if the opposition is any better.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This cuts to the heart of Serbia&rsquo;s political malaise: It&rsquo;s not that Vucic and his party are widely adored but, unlike the opposition, they have yet to experience a self-inflicted fall from grace.</p>\n<blockquote>It&rsquo;s not that Vucic and his party are widely adored but, unlike the opposition, they have yet to experience a self-inflicted fall from grace.</blockquote>\n<p>In contrast to their opponents, they still have political capital to spend. Until this changes, protesters will struggle to rally the sort of mass mobilization that finally pushed Milosevic out of power in 2000.</p>\n<p>At the moment, no one is able to present a radically different vision for the country. The Alliance for Serbia published a &ldquo;30-point&rdquo; <a href=\"https://savez-za-srbiju.rs/program/\">political program</a>, but two-thirds of these points are just single-line slogans. There is no Serbian Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders who can convincingly pledge to transform the country&rsquo;s politics. Centrists can promise a freer media and less political violence, but for most people these are relatively minor tweaks to the status quo. Their main selling point is that they&rsquo;re not Vucic.</p>\n<p>No candidate can realistically offer substantially better living standards because Serbia&rsquo;s problems&mdash;an aging population, brain drain, poverty, corruption, a stagnant and left-behind economy that&rsquo;s ill-equipped for the 21st century&mdash;predate the current government. Serbia&rsquo;s neighbors, even ones that hold EU membership, like Croatia and Bulgaria, all face similar challenges. This would remain constant even if Vucic were to be deposed, and most voters understand that, which dents the opposition&rsquo;s draw.</p>\n<p>The president&rsquo;s domination over political life in Serbia also distracts from a much deeper rot in the country&rsquo;s political system. Serbian politicians frequently switch parties. There have been more than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat/srbija-45941609\">500 defections</a> since the 2016 local elections, and some 45 percent of these have crossed over to Vucic&rsquo;s Progressive Party. Smaller parties, like the Socialist Party of Serbia, repeatedly act as kingmakers in coalition talks, an arrangement that allows their politicians to remain in government in perpetuity.</p>\n<p>Ivica Dacic, the current foreign minister, is a prime example: a key figure in the Socialist party since the early 1990s, his closeness to Slobodan Milosevic earned him the nickname &ldquo;Little Sloba.&rdquo; Before taking up his current position, he served as both interior minister and prime minister in just the last decade alone. Dacic is hardly an isolated example: Zorana Mihajlovic, Maja Gojkovic, and Aleksandar Vulin are just three prominent government figures with similar resumes. This creates a malign sort of continuity in which each new government contains remnants of the one that preceded it, such that nothing ever seems to change. Even if Vucic were to step down, many of his cronies would remain in some capacity, ready to build upon his troubling political blueprint.</p>\n<blockquote>Even if Vucic were to step down, many of his cronies would remain in some capacity, ready to build upon his troubling political blueprint.</blockquote>\n<p>This is why any talk of a Balkan Spring should be taken with a pinch of salt. There is no panacea that will end the country&rsquo;s malaise, and meaningful, lasting change will only be achieved through a complete and total overhaul of Serbia&rsquo;s institutions and political culture. Deposing Vucic might be the first step toward achieving this aim, but the challenges that follow would be much greater. The protesters should bear that in mind, otherwise this latest wave of demonstrations will amount to nothing more than a brief gust of warm wind in Serbia&rsquo;s long post-Yugoslav freeze.</p>",

                "text": "BELGRADE, Serbia\u2014Over the past three months, the residents of Belgrade have developed a new weekly ritual: Every Saturday evening, thousands of them gather near Republic Square in the center of the city for a protest march against the political violence, democratic backsliding, and deterioration of media freedoms that have become widespread under the current government and its autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic.\nThe protests, which started on Dec. 8 last year, have spread to several dozen cities across Serbia and have even inspired similar protests in Albania and Montenegro, where activists have risen up against their own crooked political classes. Last Saturday, on March 16, the demonstrations reached a new crescendo when protesters and opposition leaders in Belgrade stormed the headquarters of state broadcaster Radio Television Serbia, which led to their forced removal by riot police.\nLast Saturday, on March 16, the demonstrations reached a new crescendo when protesters and opposition leaders in Belgrade stormed the headquarters of state broadcaster Radio Television Serbia, which led to their forced removal by riot police.\nThat same night in Albania, protesters lobbed stones and clashed with police in front of the parliament building in Tirana. This blossoming of dissent has led some to wonder if this might be the beginning of a \u201cBalkan Spring.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s Nigerian Ban Is About Race, Not Security\nIn Serbia, the protests were triggered by the beating of Borko Stefanovic, an opposition politician and leader of the Serbian Left party, in the southern city of Krusevac on November 23, 2018, where he was left bloodied and hospitalized after being assaulted by a group of assailants wielding blunt objects. The following day, one of Stefanovic\u2019s allies, Dragan Djilas, told reporters that Vucic was \u201cthe main culprit\u201d behind the assault. The first demonstration was held in Krusevac a week later under the banner of \u201cStop the Bloody Shirts\u201d and was organized by the Alliance for Serbia, a coalition of various opposition parties that includes the Serbian Left and spans the entire breadth of the country\u2019s political spectrum.\nThe inaugural Belgrade protest took place the following weekend and was organized independently of the opposition alliance by a group of students from the University of Political Sciences. The assault on Stefanovic might have been the spark that lit the fuse, but the protesters took aim at a much greater foe than his attackers: Their target was the government in its entirety and Vucic himself, whom they blame for the deteriorating political conditions in the country. The protesters elicited a typically pigheaded response from the president, who claimed that he would not give into their demands, \u201ceven if there were 5 million people in the streets.\u201d This was quickly adopted as their slogan: \u201cOne in 5 Million\u201d.\nAlthough temperatures in the Balkans are rising, neither budding flowers nor mass protests should be mistaken for the beginning of a Balkan Spring modeled on the revolutions that rocked the Arab world in 2011.\nAlthough temperatures in the Balkans are rising, neither budding flowers nor mass protests should be mistaken for the beginning of a Balkan Spring modeled on the revolutions that rocked the Arab world in 2011.\nVucic has, lest we forget, seen out mass protests before, following his 2017 presidential election victory, when he finished 38 points ahead of his nearest competitor. For nearly two full months, citizens took to the street on an almost daily basis to protest \u201cagainst the dictatorship,\u201d as they called it. By the end of May the demonstrations had largely fizzled out.\nThe protesters opposed Vucic and his hegemonic rule, but they could offer no alternative. Only one opposition figure, the former ombudsman Sasa Jankovic, won more votes than a spoof candidate who promised to build Serbia a coastline. Then, like now, the protesters lacked a serious strategy that would allow them to achieve their aims. They could mobilize a crowd, but they lacked a clearly defined path to victory, and it was inevitable that this aimlessness would eventually cause them to run out of steam.\nToday\u2019s protesters have improved on their 2017 predecessors by setting out several concrete demands: They\u2019ve called for the resignations of the interior minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic (a right-hand man Vucic frequently uses as an attack dog in public debates), and the health minister, Zlatibor Loncar (who allowed Vucic to pose for a hospital ward photo-op with critically ill children during a flu epidemic without wearing the appropriate medical attire and, critics allege, putting the children\u2019s health at risk), as well as two senior figures at Radio Television Serbia, which is often accused of being a government mouthpiece. Protesters have also called for convictions in the unsolved 2018 assassination of Oliver Ivanovic, a Kosovo Serb politician and outspoken Vucic critic who had been a thorn in the side of the government, particularly when it came to denouncing organized crime. But it\u2019s still unclear how they plan to extract these concessions.\nThe protesters\u2019 main problem is that they\u2019re unable to apply any political pressure on the government by rallying around a candidate that might threaten Vucic\u2019s stranglehold on national politics.\nThe protesters\u2019 main problem is that they\u2019re unable to apply any political pressure on the government by rallying around a candidate that might threaten Vucic\u2019s stranglehold on national politics.\nAlthough the Alliance for Serbia has tried its hardest to attach itself to the protests, the weekly demonstrations aren\u2019t formally affiliated with any single opposition party or political figure. The entirety of the anti-Vucic ideological spectrum is represented\u2014from student Marxists to Bosko Obradovic, the ultranationalist leader of Dveri, a far-right opposition party of religious conservatives\u2014sometimes causing scuffles among the protesters. This highlights the fragmented and impotent nature of the Serbian opposition, which is united by its opposition to Vucic but unable to agree on much else.\nThe anti-Vucic movement is also hamstrung by the fact that all the opposition alternatives are deeply divisive and unpopular. The aforementioned Obradovic is a homophobe whose party opposes EU membership and wants to orientate the country towards Russia. In the 2017 election, Obradovic took 2.28 percent of the vote\u2014four times less than the spoof candidate, Ljubisa \u201cBeli\u201d Preletacevic (a pseudonym for Luka Maksimovic who campaigned in character as Beli).\nDveri currently holds the presidency of the Alliance for Serbia. The coalition was founded by Djilas, Belgrade\u2019s former mayor and a key figure in the discredited Democratic Party that dominated Serbian politics between the overthrow of Milosevic and Vucic\u2019s breakthrough 12 years later. Djilas, like other Democratic Party top brass, is widely perceived to have used his time in office to enrich himself by advancing his private business interests. Borko Stefanovic, whose beating triggered the protests, is also a Democratic Party alumnus. He served as chief negotiator in the 2008 sale of state petroleum company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), to Russia\u2019s Gazprom Neft.\nThe deal caused outrage for its closed tendering process and a final sale price that came out to only a fifth of NIS\u2019s market value at the time. Many see it as a prime example of the crooked privatizations that followed Yugoslavia\u2019s disintegration\u2014and Vucic\u2019s government launched an investigation into the sale in 2014. It\u2019s deeply ironic and profoundly cynical that someone involved in the hawking of state assets now leads a party that bills itself as \u201cLeft.\u201d Borko Stefanovic and his sometime Democratic Party colleagues need to shoulder some of the blame for the country\u2019s current political malaise, because it was their failures in office that drove a disillusioned electorate into the arms of Vucic\u2019s party.\nThis considered, it should come as little surprise that the Serbian electorate remains unconvinced by the alternatives. My own grandfather is a reluctant Vucic voter who frequently complains about cuts to his pension. When I ask him why he continues to back the ruling Progressive Party, he responds with a shrug: \u201cWho else am I going to vote for? Djilas? As if the opposition is any better.\u201d\nThis cuts to the heart of Serbia\u2019s political malaise: It\u2019s not that Vucic and his party are widely adored but, unlike the opposition, they have yet to experience a self-inflicted fall from grace.\nIt\u2019s not that Vucic and his party are widely adored but, unlike the opposition, they have yet to experience a self-inflicted fall from grace.\nIn contrast to their opponents, they still have political capital to spend. Until this changes, protesters will struggle to rally the sort of mass mobilization that finally pushed Milosevic out of power in 2000.\nAt the moment, no one is able to present a radically different vision for the country. The Alliance for Serbia published a \u201c30-point\u201d political program, but two-thirds of these points are just single-line slogans. There is no Serbian Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders who can convincingly pledge to transform the country\u2019s politics. Centrists can promise a freer media and less political violence, but for most people these are relatively minor tweaks to the status quo. Their main selling point is that they\u2019re not Vucic.\nNo candidate can realistically offer substantially better living standards because Serbia\u2019s problems\u2014an aging population, brain drain, poverty, corruption, a stagnant and left-behind economy that\u2019s ill-equipped for the 21st century\u2014predate the current government. Serbia\u2019s neighbors, even ones that hold EU membership, like Croatia and Bulgaria, all face similar challenges. This would remain constant even if Vucic were to be deposed, and most voters understand that, which dents the opposition\u2019s draw.\nThe president\u2019s domination over political life in Serbia also distracts from a much deeper rot in the country\u2019s political system. Serbian politicians frequently switch parties. There have been more than 500 defections since the 2016 local elections, and some 45 percent of these have crossed over to Vucic\u2019s Progressive Party. Smaller parties, like the Socialist Party of Serbia, repeatedly act as kingmakers in coalition talks, an arrangement that allows their politicians to remain in government in perpetuity.\nIvica Dacic, the current foreign minister, is a prime example: a key figure in the Socialist party since the early 1990s, his closeness to Slobodan Milosevic earned him the nickname \u201cLittle Sloba.\u201d Before taking up his current position, he served as both interior minister and prime minister in just the last decade alone. Dacic is hardly an isolated example: Zorana Mihajlovic, Maja Gojkovic, and Aleksandar Vulin are just three prominent government figures with similar resumes. This creates a malign sort of continuity in which each new government contains remnants of the one that preceded it, such that nothing ever seems to change. Even if Vucic were to step down, many of his cronies would remain in some capacity, ready to build upon his troubling political blueprint.\nEven if Vucic were to step down, many of his cronies would remain in some capacity, ready to build upon his troubling political blueprint.\nThis is why any talk of a Balkan Spring should be taken with a pinch of salt. There is no panacea that will end the country\u2019s malaise, and meaningful, lasting change will only be achieved through a complete and total overhaul of Serbia\u2019s institutions and political culture. Deposing Vucic might be the first step toward achieving this aim, but the challenges that follow would be much greater. The protesters should bear that in mind, otherwise this latest wave of demonstrations will amount to nothing more than a brief gust of warm wind in Serbia\u2019s long post-Yugoslav freeze.",

                "html": "<p>As a species, we seem to be in a period of considerable uncertainty, where familiar features of the political landscape are disappearing, and it is not clear what will replace them. Will NATO and the European Union be around in five or 10 years, and in anything like their present form? Will the United States still be fighting shadowy opponents in distant lands? Is China destined to dominate Asia, and maybe the world? Will artificial intelligence sweep away jobs in sector after sector of the economy? How much of the planet will be underwater or uninhabitable due to climate change, and how many millions of people will be seeking refuge from war, crime, oppression, corruption, or environmental degradation? Are the dysfunctions afflicting many wealthy democracies a momentary blip or the beginning of a slide into dictatorship?</p>\n<p>I could go on, but you get the idea. Prediction is always hard, of course, especially about the future, but there was a time when many people thought they knew exactly where we were headed. Back in the early 1990s, plenty of American pundits, professors, and politicians were confident they knew what the future held, and many of them were pretty optimistic about it.

If you go back a mere 500 years, which amounts to a blip in human history, the idea of a single unified global system was effectively unknown. Europeans were just figuring out that North and South America existed, and most people were completely unaware that <em>Homo sapiens </em>lived all over the world. All politics really was local back then. Economic growth worldwide had been exceedingly modest for centuries, and there were only 500 million people on the entire planet (compared to nearly 8 billion today).</p>\n<p>Roughly 200 years ago, China was one-third of the world economy, all of Europe together was about 25 percent, and the United States was inconsequential: a mere 2 percent. Then Europe took off&mdash;fueled by the Industrial Revolution&mdash;and by 1900 it was 40 percent of the world economy and home to the world&rsquo;s strongest military powers. China&rsquo;s share had fallen to around 10 percent, and the United States was busily expanding across North America and growing so rapidly that it had become the world&rsquo;s largest economy (and a legitimate great power) in just a century. Japan had taken off, too, following the Meiji Restoration, and it was beginning to throw its weight around in Asia.</p>\n<p>Then what happened? The great powers of Europe fought two horrific World Wars. The United States entered both of them late, suffered the least damage, and emerged the world&rsquo;s most powerful country by a considerable margin. The Soviet Union had become a modern industrial and military power too&mdash;though its economy still trailed America&rsquo;s by a lot&mdash;and from 1945 to 1989 the two continent-sized superpowers waged a relentless global Cold War that cost trillions of dollars and killed millions of people in proxy wars. The United States and its alliance system proved to be stronger and more resilient than the Warsaw Pact, however, and the Soviet Union eventually collapsed in at the end of 1991. U.S. leaders woke up to find themselves &ldquo;at the height of power&rdquo; with &ldquo;the rarest opportunity to shape the world &hellip; for the benefit of not just the United States but all nations,&rdquo; as former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/World-Transformed-George-H-Bush/dp/0679752595\">wrote</a> of the experience. And that&rsquo;s exactly what they have tried to do ever since, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hell-Good-Intentions-Americas-Foreign/dp/0374280037\">albeit not very successfully.</a></p>\n<p>Two other developments are worth highlighting. The first: After Mao Zedong died in 1976, his successors abandoned most of his principles and embraced the market, and China took off. It is now the world&rsquo;s No. 2 economy and America&rsquo;s only possible peer competitor.</p>\n<p>The second: It turned out we humans were having an enormous impact on the global environment, including a potentially irreversible and destructive rise in average global temperature. And according to the <a href=\"https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/publications/1187/files/original/LPR2018_Full_Report_Spreads.pdf\">WWF</a>, global populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have declined on average by 60 percent (!) since 1970, mostly due to human activity.</p>\n<p>My point is that the past 500 years have seen enormous shifts in the balance of wealth and power around the world, together with significant changes in political attitudes and the environment in which we all live. And many of these changes were wholly unexpected.</p>\n<p>As I noted in a <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/05/12/what-will-2050-look-like-china-nato/\">previous column</a>, the world of 1978 (my second year in graduate school) was vastly different than the world we live in today. There were two Germanys, the Warsaw Pact was intact, and it was the Soviet Union&mdash;not the United States&mdash;that was entering a quagmire in Afghanistan. North Korea and Pakistan had no nuclear weapons, but the United States and Soviet Union together <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons\">had more than 50,000</a>. The United Kingdom had joined the European Union six years prior, and every European country had its own currency and border controls. Gay sex was illegal in many countries, and gay people couldn&rsquo;t marry <em>anywhere. </em>The Japanese economy was growing like gangbusters, and Harvard University professors were writing books with titles like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Japan-Number-One-Lessons-America/dp/1583484108\"><em>Japan as No. 1</em></a><em>.</em> The United States had more than 200,000 troops in Europe and hardly any in the Middle East. South Africa had an apartheid regime, nobody had any idea that climate change was occurring, and there were no personal computers, cell phones, internet, Spotify, Facebook, email, or even compact discs. It cost so much to dial long distance in the United States that one often waited till after 11 p.m. to take advantage of lower rates. If you traveled abroad, you stayed in touch with friends and family not on Facebook or Facetime or Skype but by writing letters. On paper. You could smoke on airplanes, in restaurants, and inside most public buildings, but smoking pot anywhere in the United States could land you in jail. Security screening at airports was minimal. There were only three television networks in the United States (plus public TV), and <em>Saturday Night Live </em>was fresh and funny. There were 18 women in the House of Representatives (out of 435 members) and only three in the Senate, two of whom were widows appointed to fill out their deceased husbands&rsquo; terms.</p>\n<p>I draw two big lessons from these reflections. First, a lot can change in a heck of a hurry. There may be plenty of recurring behaviors in world politics&mdash;nations rise and fall, balances form, wars are fought and won, etc.&mdash;but understanding global politics today consists mostly of figuring out how novel features and the familiar elements combine.</p>\n<p>Second, I&rsquo;m struck by the degree to which change, especially the rise or fall of different countries, is shaped not by anonymous social forces but by specific acts of political choice. Big structural features such as population and geography do matter, of course, but the fate of nations has often been determined as much or more by the choices they make. The European great powers hastened their decline by fighting self-destructive wars, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Venezuela&rsquo;s election of President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom were all enormous self-inflicted wounds that were far from inevitable. Such follies remind us that things can go south in a hurry, even for those who are favorably situated.</p>\n<p>For Americans, the good news is that their country is still powerful, wealthy, and <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300222555/clear-and-present-safety\">remarkably secure</a>. The bad news is that U.S. society is increasingly polarized, its political institutions are not working well, and economic inequality is at record levels. When the normally pro-American <em>Economist </em>magazine&rsquo;s annual <a href=\"https://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index\">Democracy Index</a> downgrades the United States from a &ldquo;full&rdquo; to a &ldquo;flawed&rdquo; democracy, it&rsquo;s time to start worrying.</p>\n<p>Why is that a problem? Because the number of problems we need to address is growing and at an increasingly rapid rate. Even with the best of intentions and a lot of hard work, issues such as climate change, refugees, changing labor markets, soaring deficits, violent extremists, privacy, shifting balances of power, etc. may outstrip our capacity to come up with workable solutions. Just look at how much trouble U.S. President Donald Trump is having coming up with a halfway decent policy on immigration, which was one of his signature issues during the 2016 campaign. That&rsquo;s partly because Trump is a terrible manager and his advisors appear to be mostly incompetent hacks, but it&rsquo;s not like Trump&rsquo;s predecessors did a lot better on this issue.</p>\n<p>Paradoxically, addressing problems such as these successfully will require paying less attention to conditions abroad and more attention to domestic institutions. Instead of devoting endless hours and countless billions of dollars trying to determine the local politics of distant lands that the United States does not understand&mdash;even after nearly two decades of trying&mdash;Americans should focus more of their political energies on making their political institutions more representative, less skewed in favor of wealthy interests, and more capable of decisive action. It also means recognizing that government has an important role to play, and doing more to recruit exceptionally talented people to government service.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the nearest analogy to America&rsquo;s current situation is the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era that it spawned. At the beginning of the 20th century, Americans also faced the challenges of vast inequality, a political order that was deeply corrupt, millions of new immigrants seeking a new life in the United States, and significant disagreement about the role the country should play on the world stage. The Progressive Era was also a moment of great political energy, when reformers gradually gained political power and created many of the institutions that got the country through the 20th century. One can see analogues today in proposals for a Green New Deal or the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1/text\">For the People Act of 2019</a>, which contains various measures intended to improve U.S. electoral institutions.</p>\n<p>Whatever the specific merits of these proposals, their emergence today is a hopeful sign. Whether it is enough, however, remains to be seen.</p>",

                "text": "As a species, we seem to be in a period of considerable uncertainty, where familiar features of the political landscape are disappearing, and it is not clear what will replace them. Will NATO and the European Union be around in five or 10 years, and in anything like their present form? Will the United States still be fighting shadowy opponents in distant lands? Is China destined to dominate Asia, and maybe the world? Will artificial intelligence sweep away jobs in sector after sector of the economy? How much of the planet will be underwater or uninhabitable due to climate change, and how many millions of people will be seeking refuge from war, crime, oppression, corruption, or environmental degradation? Are the dysfunctions afflicting many wealthy democracies a momentary blip or the beginning of a slide into dictatorship?\nI could go on, but you get the idea. Prediction is always hard, of course, especially about the future, but there was a time when many people thought they knew exactly where we were headed. Back in the early 1990s, plenty of American pundits, professors, and politicians were confident they knew what the future held, and many of them were pretty optimistic about it. People like Samuel Huntington and Robert Kaplan saw dark days ahead, but scholars like Francis Fukuyama, journalists like Thomas Friedman, and politicians like Bill Clinton believed a shiny new globalized world of liberal democratic capitalism was dawning and would render old-style power politics obsolete.\nThe U.S. president offers a glimpse of what four more years would look like after \u201ctotal acquittal\u201d by the Senate.\nAt moments like the present, it may be helpful to step back and remind ourselves of just how much the world has really changed\u2014and how much it hasn\u2019t. If you go back a mere 500 years, which amounts to a blip in human history, the idea of a single unified global system was effectively unknown. Europeans were just figuring out that North and South America existed, and most people were completely unaware that Homo sapiens lived all over the world. All politics really was local back then. Economic growth worldwide had been exceedingly modest for centuries, and there were only 500 million people on the entire planet (compared to nearly 8 billion today).\nRoughly 200 years ago, China was one-third of the world economy, all of Europe together was about 25 percent, and the United States was inconsequential: a mere 2 percent. Then Europe took off\u2014fueled by the Industrial Revolution\u2014and by 1900 it was 40 percent of the world economy and home to the world\u2019s strongest military powers. China\u2019s share had fallen to around 10 percent, and the United States was busily expanding across North America and growing so rapidly that it had become the world\u2019s largest economy (and a legitimate great power) in just a century. Japan had taken off, too, following the Meiji Restoration, and it was beginning to throw its weight around in Asia.\nThen what happened? The great powers of Europe fought two horrific World Wars. The United States entered both of them late, suffered the least damage, and emerged the world\u2019s most powerful country by a considerable margin. The Soviet Union had become a modern industrial and military power too\u2014though its economy still trailed America\u2019s by a lot\u2014and from 1945 to 1989 the two continent-sized superpowers waged a relentless global Cold War that cost trillions of dollars and killed millions of people in proxy wars. The United States and its alliance system proved to be stronger and more resilient than the Warsaw Pact, however, and the Soviet Union eventually collapsed in at the end of 1991. U.S. leaders woke up to find themselves \u201cat the height of power\u201d with \u201cthe rarest opportunity to shape the world \u2026 for the benefit of not just the United States but all nations,\u201d as former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft wrote of the experience. And that\u2019s exactly what they have tried to do ever since, albeit not very successfully.\nTwo other developments are worth highlighting. The first: After Mao Zedong died in 1976, his successors abandoned most of his principles and embraced the market, and China took off. It is now the world\u2019s No. 2 economy and America\u2019s only possible peer competitor.\nThe second: It turned out we humans were having an enormous impact on the global environment, including a potentially irreversible and destructive rise in average global temperature. And according to the WWF, global populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have declined on average by 60 percent (!) since 1970, mostly due to human activity.\nMy point is that the past 500 years have seen enormous shifts in the balance of wealth and power around the world, together with significant changes in political attitudes and the environment in which we all live. And many of these changes were wholly unexpected.\nAs I noted in a previous column, the world of 1978 (my second year in graduate school) was vastly different than the world we live in today. There were two Germanys, the Warsaw Pact was intact, and it was the Soviet Union\u2014not the United States\u2014that was entering a quagmire in Afghanistan. North Korea and Pakistan had no nuclear weapons, but the United States and Soviet Union together had more than 50,000. The United Kingdom had joined the European Union six years prior, and every European country had its own currency and border controls. Gay sex was illegal in many countries, and gay people couldn\u2019t marry anywhere. The Japanese economy was growing like gangbusters, and Harvard University professors were writing books with titles like Japan as No. 1. The United States had more than 200,000 troops in Europe and hardly any in the Middle East. South Africa had an apartheid regime, nobody had any idea that climate change was occurring, and there were no personal computers, cell phones, internet, Spotify, Facebook, email, or even compact discs. It cost so much to dial long distance in the United States that one often waited till after 11 p.m. to take advantage of lower rates. If you traveled abroad, you stayed in touch with friends and family not on Facebook or Facetime or Skype but by writing letters. On paper. You could smoke on airplanes, in restaurants, and inside most public buildings, but smoking pot anywhere in the United States could land you in jail. Security screening at airports was minimal. There were only three television networks in the United States (plus public TV), and Saturday Night Live was fresh and funny. There were 18 women in the House of Representatives (out of 435 members) and only three in the Senate, two of whom were widows appointed to fill out their deceased husbands\u2019 terms.\nI draw two big lessons from these reflections. First, a lot can change in a heck of a hurry. There may be plenty of recurring behaviors in world politics\u2014nations rise and fall, balances form, wars are fought and won, etc.\u2014but understanding global politics today consists mostly of figuring out how novel features and the familiar elements combine.\nSecond, I\u2019m struck by the degree to which change, especially the rise or fall of different countries, is shaped not by anonymous social forces but by specific acts of political choice. Big structural features such as population and geography do matter, of course, but the fate of nations has often been determined as much or more by the choices they make. The European great powers hastened their decline by fighting self-destructive wars, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Venezuela\u2019s election of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom were all enormous self-inflicted wounds that were far from inevitable. Such follies remind us that things can go south in a hurry, even for those who are favorably situated.\nFor Americans, the good news is that their country is still powerful, wealthy, and remarkably secure. The bad news is that U.S. society is increasingly polarized, its political institutions are not working well, and economic inequality is at record levels. When the normally pro-American Economist magazine\u2019s annual Democracy Index downgrades the United States from a \u201cfull\u201d to a \u201cflawed\u201d democracy, it\u2019s time to start worrying.\nWhy is that a problem? Because the number of problems we need to address is growing and at an increasingly rapid rate. Even with the best of intentions and a lot of hard work, issues such as climate change, refugees, changing labor markets, soaring deficits, violent extremists, privacy, shifting balances of power, etc. may outstrip our capacity to come up with workable solutions. Just look at how much trouble U.S. President Donald Trump is having coming up with a halfway decent policy on immigration, which was one of his signature issues during the 2016 campaign. That\u2019s partly because Trump is a terrible manager and his advisors appear to be mostly incompetent hacks, but it\u2019s not like Trump\u2019s predecessors did a lot better on this issue.\nParadoxically, addressing problems such as these successfully will require paying less attention to conditions abroad and more attention to domestic institutions. Instead of devoting endless hours and countless billions of dollars trying to determine the local politics of distant lands that the United States does not understand\u2014even after nearly two decades of trying\u2014Americans should focus more of their political energies on making their political institutions more representative, less skewed in favor of wealthy interests, and more capable of decisive action. It also means recognizing that government has an important role to play, and doing more to recruit exceptionally talented people to government service.\nPerhaps the nearest analogy to America\u2019s current situation is the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era that it spawned. At the beginning of the 20th century, Americans also faced the challenges of vast inequality, a political order that was deeply corrupt, millions of new immigrants seeking a new life in the United States, and significant disagreement about the role the country should play on the world stage. The Progressive Era was also a moment of great political energy, when reformers gradually gained political power and created many of the institutions that got the country through the 20th century. One can see analogues today in proposals for a Green New Deal or the For the People Act of 2019, which contains various measures intended to improve U.S. electoral institutions.\nWhatever the specific merits of these proposals, their emergence today is a hopeful sign. Whether it is enough, however, remains to be seen.",

There is the stained glass, the altar, the structures, and the building, so all of this will require different kinds of experts analyzing their different areas of specialty. I&rsquo;m particularly concerned with the condition of the stone walls. That fire was immense and incredibly hot&mdash;although stone won&rsquo;t actually burn, it can be terribly damaged by great heat. The whole area of the vaults and upper walls will need to be assessed.</p>\n<p>I am imagining, though I don&rsquo;t know, that this restoration will take at least a decade. The critical thing will be to cover the building, to find a way to protect what are now the exposed upper surfaces of the vaults&mdash;from water, from the weather&mdash;and also the building downstairs.</p>\n<p>Flames glow through the windows of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on April 15. (Michel Stoupak/NurPhoto via Getty Images)</p>\n<p><strong>FP:</strong> Based on your research on the construction of Notre Dame and the history of it, how vulnerable was it just before the fire? They were doing reconstruction for a reason, after all.</p>\n<p><strong>CB:</strong> Well, yes, it was badly in need of restoration in the parts we do not see when we walk in the building, and I&rsquo;m talking specifically about the enormous wooden structure between the upper parts of the vaults and the roof. That&rsquo;s old timber. For centuries, it gets heated in the summer and frozen in the winter, and that was incredibly flammable, and that&rsquo;s why the fire was so horrific and spectacular. It was those old timbers that were burning so ferociously. We saw the fire spread from one section to another in rapid succession.</p>\n<p><strong>FP:</strong> Do you think it was something of a miracle that so much was preserved?</p>\n<p><strong>CB:</strong> Yeah, when I saw the photographs late last night of the interior, I was hugely relieved because it looked as though only a couple of the vaults were penetrated by either the spire falling or by beams falling through them. Now we don&rsquo;t know about the condition of the rest of the vaults. As soon as the fire is over, the weakening of the structure may mean that things will be falling down from high up. Remember that a Gothic cathedral is a dynamic structure, where you have vaults pushing out and flying buttresses pushing inward, and when that system is compromised, it may become very dangerous.</p>\n<p>A burned-through hole in the roof from the interior of Notre Dame Cathedral on April 15.

(Philippe Wojazer/AFP/Getty Images)</p>\n<p><strong>FP:</strong> What we do seem to know at this point is that many of the relics inside and apparently the stained-glass rose windows were preserved.</p>\n<p><strong>CB:</strong> That&rsquo;s wonderful. Again, it depends on where the fire was concentrated. Some of the most beautiful windows in the church were in the transept arms on the north side and south side, and if those were preserved, we&rsquo;re on our knees in gratitude. I haven&rsquo;t yet seen pictures of them.</p>\n<p><strong>FP:</strong> Can you talk about your original interest in Notre Dame&mdash;why you researched it?</p>\n<p><strong>CB:</strong> I was actually living in Paris and working on another book, back in the late &rsquo;70s, when they began to clean the inside, and that was an amazing opportunity. There was a scaffolding erected up the entire height of the building, and when I checked around, no architectural historian trained in medieval buildings was going up and down that scaffolding. It was a lifetime opportunity to see parts of the building that normally nobody can see. I ended up writing a very long and probably deeply boring article about it because I&rsquo;m interested in how buildings are put up.</p>\n<p>Flames and smoke billow around the gargoyles on Notre Dame Cathedral on April 15. (Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images)</p>\n<p><strong>FP:</strong> And you were looking particularly at the stone walls?</p>\n<p><strong>CB:</strong> Yes, if you measure them, if you record every detail, you begin to unfold a narrative over time.</p>\n<p><strong>FP:</strong> So based on your intimate knowledge of the cathedral&rsquo;s construction, can you talk about what reconstruction will entail?</p>\n<p><strong>CB:</strong> I&rsquo;m guessing that will probably take a number of months just to understand how bad the damage is, where the most urgent repairs are. I imagine they&rsquo;re going to have to put up wooden framework, wooden struts, in those areas especially where the vaults were partially collapsed. You don&rsquo;t want more stones falling down&mdash;you need to support what has been damaged&mdash;so there&rsquo;s going to be some temporary shoring up before they can really begin to repair.</p>\n<p>Smoke rises over Paris from Notre Dame Cathedral on April 15. (Veronique de Viguerie/Getty Images)</p>\n<p><strong>FP:</strong> And I guess it will be a long, long time before the public can gain access again.</p>\n<p><strong>CB:</strong> Alas, that is true. But you know one thing I&rsquo;m hoping is that the public will become more aware of the fragility of our historical buildings. They&rsquo;ll put money in the box and ask for donations for upkeep. And maybe they&rsquo;ll treat these buildings not just as the obligatory sight you go to see in Paris but really as a building that has had an enormously interesting life and has played a fundamental role in the history of France.</p>\n<p><em>This conversation has been condensed and edited for publication.</em></p>",

                "text": "Q&A\nDespite being spared the worst, Notre Dame is not out of danger, says the building expert Caroline Bruzelius.\nCaroline Bruzelius, an architectural historian at Duke University, has scaled the heights of Notre Dame in ways that few people have\u2014and she is thus all too aware of how fragile the cathedral remains in spite of being saved from total devastation during Monday night\u2019s raging fire. Bruzelius, an expert in Gothic cathedrals, studied the revered structure closely from top to bottom nearly four decades ago when scaffolding was erected around it for cleaning, and she later wrote a scholarly article going into great detail about the building\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. She spoke with Foreign Policy on Tuesday about the long road of reconstruction that lies ahead.\nForeign Policy: The news looks better today than the worst that was feared last night regarding damage from the fire.\nTrump\u2019s Nigerian Ban Is About Race, Not Security\nCaroline Bruzelius: I think it\u2019s going to take quite a while to really understand the extent of the damage and to which parts. There is the stained glass, the altar, the structures, and the building, so all of this will require different kinds of experts analyzing their different areas of specialty. I\u2019m particularly concerned with the condition of the stone walls. That fire was immense and incredibly hot\u2014although stone won\u2019t actually burn, it can be terribly damaged by great heat. The whole area of the vaults and upper walls will need to be assessed.\nI am imagining, though I don\u2019t know, that this restoration will take at least a decade. The critical thing will be to cover the building, to find a way to protect what are now the exposed upper surfaces of the vaults\u2014from water, from the weather\u2014and also the building downstairs.\nFlames glow through the windows of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on April 15. (Michel Stoupak/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nFP: Based on your research on the construction of Notre Dame and the history of it, how vulnerable was it just before the fire? They were doing reconstruction for a reason, after all.\nCB: Well, yes, it was badly in need of restoration in the parts we do not see when we walk in the building, and I\u2019m talking specifically about the enormous wooden structure between the upper parts of the vaults and the roof. That\u2019s old timber. For centuries, it gets heated in the summer and frozen in the winter, and that was incredibly flammable, and that\u2019s why the fire was so horrific and spectacular. It was those old timbers that were burning so ferociously. We saw the fire spread from one section to another in rapid succession.\nFP: Do you think it was something of a miracle that so much was preserved?\nCB: Yeah, when I saw the photographs late last night of the interior, I was hugely relieved because it looked as though only a couple of the vaults were penetrated by either the spire falling or by beams falling through them. Now we don\u2019t know about the condition of the rest of the vaults. As soon as the fire is over, the weakening of the structure may mean that things will be falling down from high up. Remember that a Gothic cathedral is a dynamic structure, where you have vaults pushing out and flying buttresses pushing inward, and when that system is compromised, it may become very dangerous.\nA burned-through hole in the roof from the interior of Notre Dame Cathedral on April 15.

(Philippe Wojazer/AFP/Getty Images)\nFP: What we do seem to know at this point is that many of the relics inside and apparently the stained-glass rose windows were preserved.\nCB: That\u2019s wonderful. Again, it depends on where the fire was concentrated. Some of the most beautiful windows in the church were in the transept arms on the north side and south side, and if those were preserved, we\u2019re on our knees in gratitude. I haven\u2019t yet seen pictures of them.\nFP: Can you talk about your original interest in Notre Dame\u2014why you researched it?\nCB: I was actually living in Paris and working on another book, back in the late \u201970s, when they began to clean the inside, and that was an amazing opportunity. There was a scaffolding erected up the entire height of the building, and when I checked around, no architectural historian trained in medieval buildings was going up and down that scaffolding. It was a lifetime opportunity to see parts of the building that normally nobody can see. I ended up writing a very long and probably deeply boring article about it because I\u2019m interested in how buildings are put up.\nFlames and smoke billow around the gargoyles on Notre Dame Cathedral on April 15. (Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images)\nFP: And you were looking particularly at the stone walls?\nCB: Yes, if you measure them, if you record every detail, you begin to unfold a narrative over time.\nFP: So based on your intimate knowledge of the cathedral\u2019s construction, can you talk about what reconstruction will entail?\nCB: I\u2019m guessing that will probably take a number of months just to understand how bad the damage is, where the most urgent repairs are. I imagine they\u2019re going to have to put up wooden framework, wooden struts, in those areas especially where the vaults were partially collapsed. You don\u2019t want more stones falling down\u2014you need to support what has been damaged\u2014so there\u2019s going to be some temporary shoring up before they can really begin to repair.\nSmoke rises over Paris from Notre Dame Cathedral on April 15. (Veronique de Viguerie/Getty Images)\nFP: And I guess it will be a long, long time before the public can gain access again.\nCB: Alas, that is true. But you know one thing I\u2019m hoping is that the public will become more aware of the fragility of our historical buildings. They\u2019ll put money in the box and ask for donations for upkeep. And maybe they\u2019ll treat these buildings not just as the obligatory sight you go to see in Paris but really as a building that has had an enormously interesting life and has played a fundamental role in the history of France.\nThis conversation has been condensed and edited for publication.",

(This is well past the threshold of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which was formally declared a global health emergency by WHO on Aug. 8, 2014.) Despite the fact that nearly 100,000 people have been immunized with a vaccine that is <a href=\"https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=cfa55c58ea\">97.5 percent effective</a>, infections are soaring, spread over a wide geography that is constantly catching international epidemic control experts by surprise.

North Kivu, the main area of infection, has been a war zone since 1994, when hundreds of thousands of ethnic Hutus fled there from Rwanda, fearing reprisal attacks from Tutsis after 75 percent of the Tutsi population was slaughtered in a mass genocide. The Rwandan army swept into the region in 1996, spawning a massive war involving multiple African nations that eventually claimed more than <a href=\"https://www.caritas.org/2010/02/six-million-dead-in-congos-war/\">6 million</a> lives. Though that war officially ended in 2003, fighting <a href=\"http://worldwithoutgenocide.org/genocides-and-conflicts/congo\">never stopped</a> in North Kivu and today involves an estimated <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Landscape%20of%20Armed%20Groups%20Essay%20KST.pdf\">120 groups</a> that range from sophisticated, well-armed armies to ragtag bands of self-proclaimed &ldquo;liberators&rdquo; that operate as criminal gangs (for which the international health care responders&rsquo; foreign funds are a lucrative target).</p>\n<p>Although Americans have played a minor role in this epidemic, because the U.S. State Department forbids federal employees from venturing into the dangerous North Kivu area, the global response has been aggressive and smart. Past mistakes in epidemic responses have largely been corrected, WHO has executed bold leadership, there is an effective vaccine, and despite the constant threat of violence, hundreds of health responders from all over the world are on the scene. Yet the epidemic continues to expand, and in late-night conversations with WHO&rsquo;s Tedros, I have asked why he is reluctant to declare a global emergency. The audibly exhausted director-general quizzed back, &ldquo;What is to be gained by doing so?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He has a point. Other than perhaps loosening U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo&rsquo;s restrictions limiting scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from joining the response, and putting an enormous guilt trip on the World Bank to offer a few million dollars, it&rsquo;s hard to identify what a heightened state of urgency might offer. Any enhancement in military presence&mdash;increasing the numbers of <a href=\"https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/mission/monusco\">United Nations peacekeepers</a> over the roughly 20,000 now in North Kivu or expanding the size of the Congolese national army presence&mdash;would invite counteraction from rebel forces, likely escalating warfare. Moreover, many local citizens are already convinced that the entire Ebola crisis was concocted by corrupt officials in Congo&rsquo;s faraway capital, Kinshasa, for a variety of nefarious purposes; a military escalation would only appear to validate their conspiracy theories.</p>\n<p>One set of actions, however, can and should be taken immediately by the Trump administration, the U.N. Security Council, the G-20, and international trade offices in countries with significant mobile phone and laptop production and manufacturing facilities. It concerns the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/opinion/sunday/congo-mining-election-fraud.html\">vast mineral riches</a> in the soils of North Kivu, sales of which <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2016/pdf/Congo.pdf\">finance</a> weapons purchases for all of the rival forces in the region and constitute a <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2018-09-26-kivu-the-forgotten-war\">key incentive</a> behind the ongoing violence.</p>\n<p>Conflict seems to have <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=128631&page=1\">deepened</a> in North Kivu alongside the spectacular global growth in the <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2013/09/conflict-minerals-from-the-congo-is-your-cellphone-made-with-them.html\">mobile phones</a> market, which has made the locally plentiful black stones of columbite-tantalite, or <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2016/pdf/Congo.pdf\">coltan</a>, potentially more valuable than Congo&rsquo;s gold, diamonds, uranium, and other minerals and gems. (The mineral trade brings as much as <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/dodd-frank-1502-and-congo-crisis\">$1.4 billion</a> per year.) Coltan is a heat-resistant mix of compounds that conduct high-energy signals inside laptops, electric cars, and cell phones, allowing compressed signals to display videos and games without exploding and batteries to safely store energy.

Nine years ago, the U.N. Security Council passed <a href=\"https://undocs.org/S/RES/1952(2010)\">Resolution 1952</a>, calling for an end to the trade in conflict minerals and stipulating that &ldquo;all States, particularly those in the region, regularly publish full import and export statistics for natural resources including gold, cassiterite, coltan, wolframite, timber, and charcoal and enhance information sharing and joint action at the regional level to investigate and combat regional criminal networks and armed groups involved in the illegal exploitation of natural resources.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Numerous other coltan-related resolutions from the U.N. have followed since the 2010 conflict mineral declaration. Countries across Africa, as well as the European Union and Chinese government, have subsequently vowed to ban the purchase and use of Congolese coltan. In 2016, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/corporate/mne/mining.htm\">issued</a> strict guidelines for the mining and purchasing of coltan from conflicted-affected areas.</p>\n<p>Following the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, aimed at regulating the financial industry against future market failures. Included in that, Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act specifically <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/wallstreetreform-cpa.pdf\">requires</a> U.S. computer and technology companies to trace the origins of their supplies of essential minerals, guaranteeing that none were mined from North Kivu. Under the act, companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Dell, and their entire global supply chain of subcomponent manufacturers are required to <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/conflict-minerals/dodd-frank-act-section-1502/\">demonstrate</a> due diligence in ensuring that they know the origins of the minerals used in manufacturing their products and can prove none were derived from the Congolese conflict zone. In 2015, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals, and Chemicals Importers and Exporters <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/global-witness-welcomes-progressive-new-chinese-mineral-supply-chain-guidelines/\">adopted</a> similar language, aimed at assuring their tech manufacturing sector shuns conflict minerals.</p>\n<p>Yet scrutiny of corporate practices in purchasing coltan and other conflict minerals <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/conflict-minerals/digging-transparency/\">reveals</a> low levels of genuine compliance. Given that about <a href=\"https://ejatlas.org/conflict/congo-coltan-in-the-kivu-region-dr-of-congo\">80 percent</a> of the global supply of coltan lies in North Kivu soils, it is hard to understand how the electronics industry could continue its worldwide expansion without buying conflict minerals, though perhaps through a series of untraceable shell companies located outside of Congo.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the Trump administration vowed to eliminate Section 1502, using executive powers, and in April of that year the Securities and Exchange Commission <a href=\"https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d27d2d5f-df96-4506-8302-4b2958cb92a4\">ceased</a> enforcing it. Manufacturers claimed that full implementation of the due-diligence tracking of mineral supplies, and the need to make purchases outside of the Congolese war zone, could <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2017/02/09/trumps-xo-to-repeal-the-worst-law-of-the-year-section-1502-of-dodd-frank-on-conflict-minerals/#75c41d7647f5\">cost</a> $4 billion.

                "text": "Last week, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), declined to declare the ongoing outbreak of Ebola a global emergency. His decision came on the advice of an expert scientific panel; it was dubious nevertheless. Whatever the world chooses to call it, the disease is now on the edge of catastrophe that requires an urgent response.\nThe most urgent of all is also among the least direct. It doesn\u2019t involve Ebola at all but rather the inside of our cell phones.\nThe U.S. president offers a glimpse of what four more years would look like after \u201ctotal acquittal\u201d by the Senate.\nAs of April 13, the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has sickened 1,251 people, killing 803, or 64 percent, of the infected. (This is well past the threshold of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which was formally declared a global health emergency by WHO on Aug. 8, 2014.) Despite the fact that nearly 100,000 people have been immunized with a vaccine that is 97.5 percent effective, infections are soaring, spread over a wide geography that is constantly catching international epidemic control experts by surprise. Many of the Ebola dead never sought care, remaining unknown to authorities until their demise and dying in their homes surrounded by virally exposed friends and family, risking further expansion of the epidemic.\nThis is occurring in an atmosphere of anger, warfare, distrust, and violence that increasingly targets the international health care response. North Kivu, the main area of infection, has been a war zone since 1994, when hundreds of thousands of ethnic Hutus fled there from Rwanda, fearing reprisal attacks from Tutsis after 75 percent of the Tutsi population was slaughtered in a mass genocide. The Rwandan army swept into the region in 1996, spawning a massive war involving multiple African nations that eventually claimed more than 6 million lives. Though that war officially ended in 2003, fighting never stopped in North Kivu and today involves an estimated 120 groups that range from sophisticated, well-armed armies to ragtag bands of self-proclaimed \u201cliberators\u201d that operate as criminal gangs (for which the international health care responders\u2019 foreign funds are a lucrative target).\nAlthough Americans have played a minor role in this epidemic, because the U.S. State Department forbids federal employees from venturing into the dangerous North Kivu area, the global response has been aggressive and smart. Past mistakes in epidemic responses have largely been corrected, WHO has executed bold leadership, there is an effective vaccine, and despite the constant threat of violence, hundreds of health responders from all over the world are on the scene. Yet the epidemic continues to expand, and in late-night conversations with WHO\u2019s Tedros, I have asked why he is reluctant to declare a global emergency. The audibly exhausted director-general quizzed back, \u201cWhat is to be gained by doing so?\u201d\nHe has a point. Other than perhaps loosening U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s restrictions limiting scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from joining the response, and putting an enormous guilt trip on the World Bank to offer a few million dollars, it\u2019s hard to identify what a heightened state of urgency might offer. Any enhancement in military presence\u2014increasing the numbers of United Nations peacekeepers over the roughly 20,000 now in North Kivu or expanding the size of the Congolese national army presence\u2014would invite counteraction from rebel forces, likely escalating warfare. Moreover, many local citizens are already convinced that the entire Ebola crisis was concocted by corrupt officials in Congo\u2019s faraway capital, Kinshasa, for a variety of nefarious purposes; a military escalation would only appear to validate their conspiracy theories.\nOne set of actions, however, can and should be taken immediately by the Trump administration, the U.N. Security Council, the G-20, and international trade offices in countries with significant mobile phone and laptop production and manufacturing facilities. It concerns the vast mineral riches in the soils of North Kivu, sales of which finance weapons purchases for all of the rival forces in the region and constitute a key incentive behind the ongoing violence.\nConflict seems to have deepened in North Kivu alongside the spectacular global growth in the mobile phones market, which has made the locally plentiful black stones of columbite-tantalite, or coltan, potentially more valuable than Congo\u2019s gold, diamonds, uranium, and other minerals and gems. (The mineral trade brings as much as $1.4 billion per year.) Coltan is a heat-resistant mix of compounds that conduct high-energy signals inside laptops, electric cars, and cell phones, allowing compressed signals to display videos and games without exploding and batteries to safely store energy. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and other NGOs doing humanitarian work in the region noted a clear increase in regional violence in 2018, and rape. This is possibly linked to higher coltan demand.\nColtan is labeled a \u201cconflict mineral,\u201d which, like \u201cblood diamonds,\u201d is meant to be shunned. Nine years ago, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1952, calling for an end to the trade in conflict minerals and stipulating that \u201call States, particularly those in the region, regularly publish full import and export statistics for natural resources including gold, cassiterite, coltan, wolframite, timber, and charcoal and enhance information sharing and joint action at the regional level to investigate and combat regional criminal networks and armed groups involved in the illegal exploitation of natural resources.\u201d\nNumerous other coltan-related resolutions from the U.N. have followed since the 2010 conflict mineral declaration. Countries across Africa, as well as the European Union and Chinese government, have subsequently vowed to ban the purchase and use of Congolese coltan. In 2016, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) issued strict guidelines for the mining and purchasing of coltan from conflicted-affected areas.\nFollowing the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, aimed at regulating the financial industry against future market failures. Included in that, Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act specifically requires U.S. computer and technology companies to trace the origins of their supplies of essential minerals, guaranteeing that none were mined from North Kivu. Under the act, companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Dell, and their entire global supply chain of subcomponent manufacturers are required to demonstrate due diligence in ensuring that they know the origins of the minerals used in manufacturing their products and can prove none were derived from the Congolese conflict zone. In 2015, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals, and Chemicals Importers and Exporters adopted similar language, aimed at assuring their tech manufacturing sector shuns conflict minerals.\nYet scrutiny of corporate practices in purchasing coltan and other conflict minerals reveals low levels of genuine compliance. Given that about 80 percent of the global supply of coltan lies in North Kivu soils, it is hard to understand how the electronics industry could continue its worldwide expansion without buying conflict minerals, though perhaps through a series of untraceable shell companies located outside of Congo.\nIn 2017, the Trump administration vowed to eliminate Section 1502, using executive powers, and in April of that year the Securities and Exchange Commission ceased enforcing it. Manufacturers claimed that full implementation of the due-diligence tracking of mineral supplies, and the need to make purchases outside of the Congolese war zone, could cost $4 billion. Some researchers found that implementation of Section 1502 actually increased lawlessness and violence in the mining sector in North Kivu, bankrupting established businesses and promoting slavelike conditions in the mines. In June 2017, the Republican-led House voted to repeal Section 1502.\nWhere does this leave us? Coltan, gold, diamonds, and other minerals may not be the only sources of funding for the rival militias and armies of North Kivu, but they are certainly significant components of financing. The Trump administration, G-20, and OECD should immediately scrutinize the conflict minerals trade and the many government attempts to limit their use in cell phones and other electronics. Japan, as the host of the upcoming G-20 Summit, should place trade in coltan and its impact on the Ebola epidemic on the June gathering\u2019s Osaka agenda.\nUnless the flow of cash-for-coltan comes to a halt, our cell phones will indirectly fuel violence and spur further spread of Ebola. It\u2019s hard to believe that anybody would think watching videos on a smartphone was a reasonable trade-off for an assassinated health care worker or spread of the Ebola virus to another Congolese town.",

                "html": "<p>In 1972, the journalist Paul Cowan spent weeks roaming Manhattan&rsquo;s Lower East Side on assignment for The Village Voice, searching for the Jewish poor. He didn&rsquo;t have to look far. &ldquo;Most people think of the Jewish immigration as the most spectacularly successful one in American history,&rdquo; Cowan wrote, &ldquo;but the 50-year journey from the shtetl to the Space Age left many casualties in its wake.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At the time, an estimated 250,000 Jews in New York City lived below the poverty line. Most were elderly, many were Orthodox, but there were also young people and Jews of various religious beliefs in the mix &mdash; struggling, proud, scared, largely invisible and, as Cowan painfully acknowledged, posing a challenge to liberal Jewish values and identity.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They feel as if they&rsquo;ve been abandoned by uptown liberal Jewish intellectuals, politicians and philanthropists who, they think, care more about blacks and Puerto Ricans than about the nagging problems of the Jewish slums,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;And, worse than that, they have been abandoned by their own children. Many successful young people who have escaped the neighborhood haven&rsquo;t sent their parents money or even mail in years. And many of those who still help out do so with visible annoyance.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With his deep reporting and unsparing prose, Cowan pierced through the stereotype of the supposed American Jewish success story, reminding readers of those left behind by telling <em>their</em> stories with respect and compassion. It&rsquo;s what journalists do &mdash; even if such stories raise uncomfortable personal questions, as they did for Cowan himself.</p>\n<p>He wrote: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always seen my politics as an outgrowth of the Jewish tradition that obliged one to work with the oppressed&hellip; but as I grew to care about people on the Lower East Side, I became intensely aware that many of them would regard my ideas and activities as a form of betrayal. And the more I learned about their problems the more unsettling that contradiction became.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cowan was that rare journalist who owned up to his shortcomings. He died of cancer in 1988 when he was only 48 years old, and his willingness to hold himself and his profession accountable is sorely missed today.</p>\n<p>New York City and the surrounding region still have the largest number of poor and low-income Jewish households in the United States. According to one estimate, 20% of individual Jews in the region live in a household with an income below 150% of the federal poverty level, which for a family of four is $33,000 a year.</p>\n<p>Some are elderly &mdash; including, shamefully, Holocaust survivors. Others are ultra-Orthodox, caught in a complicated web of poverty dictated in part by strict adherence to tradition and custom. Others are poor not because they are Jewish, but because they live in an America where the flimsy social safety net cannot protect them when sudden unemployment, divorce, drug addiction, mental health issues or other unforeseen circumstances leave them destitute.</p>\n<p>Their stories rarely make today&rsquo;s version of the Jewish front page.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For the media in general, poverty is a very difficult issue to cover,&rdquo; said Alan Abbey, who is the media director of Jerusalem&rsquo;s Shalom Hartman Institute and has studied global trends in Jewish media. &ldquo;It oozes but doesn&rsquo;t break. It isn&rsquo;t a story that demands media attention in the way that politics or crime demands. The story doesn&rsquo;t have an easy, timely angle. The poor are always there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Abbey&rsquo;s sharp assessment is largely correct. But after leading the Forward for more than a decade, I would argue &mdash; and I think that Abbey would agree &mdash; that the reasons that Jewish media rarely shine a spotlight on our community&rsquo;s poor and struggling are more varied and complicated.</p>\n<p>Beyond the economic forces that shape today&rsquo;s news are, in this case, fraught questions of identity and focus. Jewish media largely reflect Jewish preoccupations &mdash; and for the establishment, that is Israel and rising anti-Semitism. It is not the poverty inflicting an elderly man afraid to leave his apartment, or a Haredi family whose lifestyle is dramatically different from the majority of American Jews, or a single mother who lost her job when Toys R Us closed.</p>\n<p>Acknowledging Jewish poverty forces us to acknowledge the fact that not all Jews are well-educated, economically successful, politically powerful, culturally assimilated and solidly middle class (or wealthier).</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is a perception that Jewish poverty is an oxymoron,&rdquo; a communal professional told me. &ldquo;There is a tremendous sense of denial in the Jewish community about how many Jews truly need help.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>To begin with, there is a matter of resources. Cowan spent weeks wandering the dilapidated streets of the Lower East Side, chatting with Jewish residents on park benches and in stores and synagogues, invited into their homes because he earned their trust. This kind of reporting takes time, skill and patience.</p>\n<p>Today those resources are in short supply. Most Jewish media organizations are scrambling to adapt to the exigencies of the digital age &mdash; and its insatiable demands for faster and sexier stories &mdash; with fewer resources at their disposal and more competition for a distracted audience.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when poverty is covered, the reporting often focuses not on the poor themselves, but on the scandals shaking the operations and reputations of the Jewish institutions charged with addressing the issue. In the past decade, employees of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, which is supposed to negotiate compensation and restitution for Holocaust survivors, were found to have committed $57 million in fraud. The executive director of the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty went to jail after being convicted of looting nearly $9 million from the New York charity. And FEGS, one of New York&rsquo;s largest social service agencies, went bankrupt and closed after reports of rampant mismanagement.</p>\n<p>Those scandals make news. The persistent grind of living with poverty does not.</p>\n<p>The truth is that American Jews are generally more affluent and economically stable than other minority groups. News organizations that serve the Jewish community should, it stands to reason, write about the mainstream, not the aberrational.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think of Jewish poverty as a priority story,&rdquo; Andrew Silow-Carroll told me. He is now the editor in chief of JTA, and he once served as editor in chief and CEO of a community newspaper in New Jersey. &ldquo;Our poor are not as prevalent as other groups. We are more likely to cover Jewish responses to poverty, but I don&rsquo;t think it is as prevalent an issue as it would be for other ethnic press.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Compounding the challenge of covering Jewish poverty is the fact that it can&rsquo;t be easily described or categorized. Even the broad label of &ldquo;elderly&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t capture the complexity. For example, in New York City &mdash; the epicenter of Jewish poverty &mdash; poor elderly Jews who emigrated from Russia face a different set of circumstances than do survivors of the Holocaust.</p>\n<p>The survivor population often suffers from unresolved psychological and emotional trauma. They may be resistant to publicity and to cries for help.</p>\n<p>Holocaust survivors &ldquo;would go hungry before they would register [for social services],&rdquo; one outreach worker in Queens told me. &ldquo;They have lived with far less than they are living with now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And &mdash; here is the surprising news I heard from a number of experts &mdash; these survivors are living longer, and therefore their needs will escalate, creating a longer-than-expected demand on social services for a population often unwilling to ask for assistance.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There still is a tremendous <em>shande</em> factor,&rdquo; the communal professional said. &ldquo;People are embarrassed because they are poor or needy. They don&rsquo;t want to be seen.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ultra-Orthodox Jews present the opposite situation: With their distinctive dress, large families, strict religious practices and tendency to live in close-knit neighborhoods, they are easily identified and just as easily (and sometimes unfairly) stereotyped. Though they make up only about one-third of the poor Jews in New York, in many minds they represent, as another communal leader told me, &ldquo;a code word for poverty.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There are reasons that such code words exist. Secular education in many Haredi communities is demonstrably weak, leaving many men unemployable or underemployed &mdash; that is, if they even wish to get a job instead of studying Jewish text full time, as many do. Women are often left struggling to balance outside work with the needs of large families, leading to a broad reliance on social welfare.</p>\n<p>As I wrote in a Forward editorial in 2012, when UJA-Federation released a major study showing the growth of Haredi poverty: &ldquo;The poverty afflicting this large and growing proportion of devout Orthodox Jews in New York is a different kind of poverty than we are used to facing historically. It&rsquo;s not the deprivation of immigrants arriving with a few dollars in their pockets. It&rsquo;s not the desperation of refugees clinging to these liberating shores. It&rsquo;s not a poverty born of the lingering discrimination that still leaves too many Americans without the education, skills and reasonable hope of escaping a never-ending cycle of need.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In many ultra-Orthodox communities, an admirable network of voluntary organizations works to alleviate this poverty, providing needy neighbors everything from Shabbat meals to used wedding dresses. But writers like Shulem Deen and other who have left the Haredi community also recount schemes of fraud and deception to obtain welfare benefits, some of which are prosecuted.</p>\n<p>This complex picture is difficult to paint accurately and fairly in Jewish media. The relative isolation of most Haredi communities makes them a challenge to cover; these communities often don&rsquo;t trust mainstream Jewish media, and that leads to a lack of empathy from reporters and editors who are not from that world.</p>\n<p>And then there is the question of what it really means to be poor in such communities.</p>\n<p>Alexander Rapaport, executive director of the Masbia Soup Kitchen Network, in New York, cautioned me not to mischaracterize the Haredi population he serves. &ldquo;Poor families tend to be stable, happy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The only thing that makes them poor is their tuition bills.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The third subset of poor American Jews are those who fall upon hard times, because of unforeseen circumstances, or individual difficulties, or structural deficiencies. Some of these stories do rise to the front page of Jewish media.</p>\n<p>During the 2008 recession, for example, there was suddenly a new category of Jews: white-collar workers who lost jobs, homes, status and independence. News organizations covered their plight and wrote about the communal programs trying to help them recover; for example, the Forward published a series in 2010 examining the struggle to find jobs in the Jewish sector after the Great Recession.</p>\n<p>Once the economy improved, however, those stories receded. And yet there remains a segment of the Jewish population that is stuck in poverty, largely invisible to the middle-class mainstream. Danielle Ellman, the dynamic CEO of Commonpoint Queens, encounters them every day at the innovative digital food pantry she oversees inside what looks like a private home on a quiet side street in Forest Hills.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There are Jewish people going to bed hungry every night, and that should be unacceptable to us,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>In the end, the priorities of Jewish media largely reflect the priorities of the Jewish community. No media organization wants to publish stories online that no one will read, and &mdash; I can speak from experience here &mdash; stories about Jewish poverty don&rsquo;t seem to be a priority for the digital audience. Community Jewish newspapers, dependent on their local federations for funding and readership, are urged to celebrate Jewish success, not highlight Jewish failure.</p>\n<p>And the fact that there are so many poor Jews in America is a communal failure. It runs counter to the narrative that Jews are the ultimate American success story, that the biggest threat to the Jewish future is intermarriage, or anti-Semitism, or the demonization of Israel &mdash; or all of the above. It also runs counter to the liberal political narrative that positions Jews as privileged and more entitled than other minorities.</p>\n<p>Decades ago, Cowan understood that, even in a nation plagued by racism and injustice, poverty also had a Jewish face. He acknowledged the contradiction in his coverage. I personally feel a deep regret that we in Jewish media do not follow his example today.</p>\n<p>Last October, after the worst terrorist attack against Jews in American history, I helped organize a joint statement. signed by all the major Jewish news organizations, that decried anti-Semitism and pledged to focus our journalism on this growing threat. Doesn&rsquo;t the prevalence of poverty among our fellow Jews deserve a similar outcry?</p>\n<p><em>This essay was adapted from a paper presented March 19 at the <a href=\"https://hjweinbergfoundation.org/jewishpovertyconvening\">National Convening on Jewish Poverty</a> in San Francisco, organized by The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation.</em></p>\n<p><em>Jane Eisner is the Forward&rsquo;s writer-at-large and the Koeppel Fellow in Journalism at Wesleyan University.

                "text": "In 1972, the journalist Paul Cowan spent weeks roaming Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side on assignment for The Village Voice, searching for the Jewish poor. He didn\u2019t have to look far. \u201cMost people think of the Jewish immigration as the most spectacularly successful one in American history,\u201d Cowan wrote, \u201cbut the 50-year journey from the shtetl to the Space Age left many casualties in its wake.\u201d\nAt the time, an estimated 250,000 Jews in New York City lived below the poverty line. Most were elderly, many were Orthodox, but there were also young people and Jews of various religious beliefs in the mix \u2014 struggling, proud, scared, largely invisible and, as Cowan painfully acknowledged, posing a challenge to liberal Jewish values and identity.\n\u201cThey feel as if they\u2019ve been abandoned by uptown liberal Jewish intellectuals, politicians and philanthropists who, they think, care more about blacks and Puerto Ricans than about the nagging problems of the Jewish slums,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd, worse than that, they have been abandoned by their own children. Many successful young people who have escaped the neighborhood haven\u2019t sent their parents money or even mail in years. And many of those who still help out do so with visible annoyance.\u201d\nWith his deep reporting and unsparing prose, Cowan pierced through the stereotype of the supposed American Jewish success story, reminding readers of those left behind by telling their stories with respect and compassion. It\u2019s what journalists do \u2014 even if such stories raise uncomfortable personal questions, as they did for Cowan himself.\nHe wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve always seen my politics as an outgrowth of the Jewish tradition that obliged one to work with the oppressed\u2026 but as I grew to care about people on the Lower East Side, I became intensely aware that many of them would regard my ideas and activities as a form of betrayal. And the more I learned about their problems the more unsettling that contradiction became.\u201d\nCowan was that rare journalist who owned up to his shortcomings. He died of cancer in 1988 when he was only 48 years old, and his willingness to hold himself and his profession accountable is sorely missed today.\nNew York City and the surrounding region still have the largest number of poor and low-income Jewish households in the United States. According to one estimate, 20% of individual Jews in the region live in a household with an income below 150% of the federal poverty level, which for a family of four is $33,000 a year.\nSome are elderly \u2014 including, shamefully, Holocaust survivors. Others are ultra-Orthodox, caught in a complicated web of poverty dictated in part by strict adherence to tradition and custom. Others are poor not because they are Jewish, but because they live in an America where the flimsy social safety net cannot protect them when sudden unemployment, divorce, drug addiction, mental health issues or other unforeseen circumstances leave them destitute.\nTheir stories rarely make today\u2019s version of the Jewish front page.\n\u201cFor the media in general, poverty is a very difficult issue to cover,\u201d said Alan Abbey, who is the media director of Jerusalem\u2019s Shalom Hartman Institute and has studied global trends in Jewish media. \u201cIt oozes but doesn\u2019t break. It isn\u2019t a story that demands media attention in the way that politics or crime demands. The story doesn\u2019t have an easy, timely angle. The poor are always there.\u201d\nAbbey\u2019s sharp assessment is largely correct. But after leading the Forward for more than a decade, I would argue \u2014 and I think that Abbey would agree \u2014 that the reasons that Jewish media rarely shine a spotlight on our community\u2019s poor and struggling are more varied and complicated.\nBeyond the economic forces that shape today\u2019s news are, in this case, fraught questions of identity and focus. Jewish media largely reflect Jewish preoccupations \u2014 and for the establishment, that is Israel and rising anti-Semitism. It is not the poverty inflicting an elderly man afraid to leave his apartment, or a Haredi family whose lifestyle is dramatically different from the majority of American Jews, or a single mother who lost her job when Toys R Us closed.\nAcknowledging Jewish poverty forces us to acknowledge the fact that not all Jews are well-educated, economically successful, politically powerful, culturally assimilated and solidly middle class (or wealthier).\n\u201cThere is a perception that Jewish poverty is an oxymoron,\u201d a communal professional told me. \u201cThere is a tremendous sense of denial in the Jewish community about how many Jews truly need help.\u201d\nTo begin with, there is a matter of resources. Cowan spent weeks wandering the dilapidated streets of the Lower East Side, chatting with Jewish residents on park benches and in stores and synagogues, invited into their homes because he earned their trust. This kind of reporting takes time, skill and patience.\nToday those resources are in short supply. Most Jewish media organizations are scrambling to adapt to the exigencies of the digital age \u2014 and its insatiable demands for faster and sexier stories \u2014 with fewer resources at their disposal and more competition for a distracted audience.\nUnfortunately, when poverty is covered, the reporting often focuses not on the poor themselves, but on the scandals shaking the operations and reputations of the Jewish institutions charged with addressing the issue. In the past decade, employees of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, which is supposed to negotiate compensation and restitution for Holocaust survivors, were found to have committed $57 million in fraud. The executive director of the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty went to jail after being convicted of looting nearly $9 million from the New York charity. And FEGS, one of New York\u2019s largest social service agencies, went bankrupt and closed after reports of rampant mismanagement.\nThose scandals make news. The persistent grind of living with poverty does not.\nThe truth is that American Jews are generally more affluent and economically stable than other minority groups. News organizations that serve the Jewish community should, it stands to reason, write about the mainstream, not the aberrational.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think of Jewish poverty as a priority story,\u201d Andrew Silow-Carroll told me. He is now the editor in chief of JTA, and he once served as editor in chief and CEO of a community newspaper in New Jersey. \u201cOur poor are not as prevalent as other groups. We are more likely to cover Jewish responses to poverty, but I don\u2019t think it is as prevalent an issue as it would be for other ethnic press.\u201d\nCompounding the challenge of covering Jewish poverty is the fact that it can\u2019t be easily described or categorized. Even the broad label of \u201celderly\u201d doesn\u2019t capture the complexity. For example, in New York City \u2014 the epicenter of Jewish poverty \u2014 poor elderly Jews who emigrated from Russia face a different set of circumstances than do survivors of the Holocaust.\nThe survivor population often suffers from unresolved psychological and emotional trauma. They may be resistant to publicity and to cries for help.\nHolocaust survivors \u201cwould go hungry before they would register [for social services],\u201d one outreach worker in Queens told me. \u201cThey have lived with far less than they are living with now.\u201d\nAnd \u2014 here is the surprising news I heard from a number of experts \u2014 these survivors are living longer, and therefore their needs will escalate, creating a longer-than-expected demand on social services for a population often unwilling to ask for assistance.\n\u201cThere still is a tremendous shande factor,\u201d the communal professional said. \u201cPeople are embarrassed because they are poor or needy. They don\u2019t want to be seen.\u201d\nUltra-Orthodox Jews present the opposite situation: With their distinctive dress, large families, strict religious practices and tendency to live in close-knit neighborhoods, they are easily identified and just as easily (and sometimes unfairly) stereotyped. Though they make up only about one-third of the poor Jews in New York, in many minds they represent, as another communal leader told me, \u201ca code word for poverty.\u201d\nThere are reasons that such code words exist. Secular education in many Haredi communities is demonstrably weak, leaving many men unemployable or underemployed \u2014 that is, if they even wish to get a job instead of studying Jewish text full time, as many do. Women are often left struggling to balance outside work with the needs of large families, leading to a broad reliance on social welfare.\nAs I wrote in a Forward editorial in 2012, when UJA-Federation released a major study showing the growth of Haredi poverty: \u201cThe poverty afflicting this large and growing proportion of devout Orthodox Jews in New York is a different kind of poverty than we are used to facing historically. It\u2019s not the deprivation of immigrants arriving with a few dollars in their pockets. It\u2019s not the desperation of refugees clinging to these liberating shores. It\u2019s not a poverty born of the lingering discrimination that still leaves too many Americans without the education, skills and reasonable hope of escaping a never-ending cycle of need.\u201d\nIn many ultra-Orthodox communities, an admirable network of voluntary organizations works to alleviate this poverty, providing needy neighbors everything from Shabbat meals to used wedding dresses. But writers like Shulem Deen and other who have left the Haredi community also recount schemes of fraud and deception to obtain welfare benefits, some of which are prosecuted.\nThis complex picture is difficult to paint accurately and fairly in Jewish media. The relative isolation of most Haredi communities makes them a challenge to cover; these communities often don\u2019t trust mainstream Jewish media, and that leads to a lack of empathy from reporters and editors who are not from that world.\nAnd then there is the question of what it really means to be poor in such communities.\nAlexander Rapaport, executive director of the Masbia Soup Kitchen Network, in New York, cautioned me not to mischaracterize the Haredi population he serves. \u201cPoor families tend to be stable, happy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing that makes them poor is their tuition bills.\u201d\nThe third subset of poor American Jews are those who fall upon hard times, because of unforeseen circumstances, or individual difficulties, or structural deficiencies. Some of these stories do rise to the front page of Jewish media.\nDuring the 2008 recession, for example, there was suddenly a new category of Jews: white-collar workers who lost jobs, homes, status and independence. News organizations covered their plight and wrote about the communal programs trying to help them recover; for example, the Forward published a series in 2010 examining the struggle to find jobs in the Jewish sector after the Great Recession.\nOnce the economy improved, however, those stories receded. And yet there remains a segment of the Jewish population that is stuck in poverty, largely invisible to the middle-class mainstream. Danielle Ellman, the dynamic CEO of Commonpoint Queens, encounters them every day at the innovative digital food pantry she oversees inside what looks like a private home on a quiet side street in Forest Hills.\n\u201cThere are Jewish people going to bed hungry every night, and that should be unacceptable to us,\u201d she said.\nIn the end, the priorities of Jewish media largely reflect the priorities of the Jewish community. No media organization wants to publish stories online that no one will read, and \u2014 I can speak from experience here \u2014 stories about Jewish poverty don\u2019t seem to be a priority for the digital audience. Community Jewish newspapers, dependent on their local federations for funding and readership, are urged to celebrate Jewish success, not highlight Jewish failure.\nAnd the fact that there are so many poor Jews in America is a communal failure. It runs counter to the narrative that Jews are the ultimate American success story, that the biggest threat to the Jewish future is intermarriage, or anti-Semitism, or the demonization of Israel \u2014 or all of the above. It also runs counter to the liberal political narrative that positions Jews as privileged and more entitled than other minorities.\nDecades ago, Cowan understood that, even in a nation plagued by racism and injustice, poverty also had a Jewish face. He acknowledged the contradiction in his coverage. I personally feel a deep regret that we in Jewish media do not follow his example today.\nLast October, after the worst terrorist attack against Jews in American history, I helped organize a joint statement. signed by all the major Jewish news organizations, that decried anti-Semitism and pledged to focus our journalism on this growing threat. Doesn\u2019t the prevalence of poverty among our fellow Jews deserve a similar outcry?\nThis essay was adapted from a paper presented March 19 at the National Convening on Jewish Poverty in San Francisco, organized by The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation.\nJane Eisner is the Forward\u2019s writer-at-large and the Koeppel Fellow in Journalism at Wesleyan University.

(The transcript usually doesn&rsquo;t say which of the two asked a question)</p>\n<p>The preacher, who said his last name was Ausderau, denied the historical accounts. &ldquo;There were millions that were killed but they were not all Jews,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We do not believe that Hitler was even the cause of that&hellip;.I believe that Hitler was a good man.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At one point, O&rsquo;Rourke pointed to Klahr and said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Jewish. Do you think he can be saved?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah!&rdquo; Ausderau responded - he claimed that he had Jewish ancestry and &ldquo;a lot of good Jewish friends,&rdquo; and that his church celebrated Passover and had Jewish congregants. But in order to be saved, the man said, Jews must accept Jesus as their savior.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke offered to sell tapes of the interview for $3. He also provided the address of Ausderau&rsquo;s church. &ldquo;Feel free to write a friendly message, or send them a &lsquo;special&rsquo; package,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Surely they&rsquo;d appreciate some &lsquo;fan&rsquo; mail&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Other pieces published by O&rsquo;Rourke as a teenager on the Cult of the Dead Cow website include a short essay about the <a href=\"http://textfiles.com/groups/CDC/cDc-0031.txt\">possibility of a money-free society</a> and a <a href=\"http://textfiles.com/groups/CDC/visions.crusade\">piece of fiction</a> in which the narrator runs over children with his car.</p>\n<p>The Cult of the Dead Cow is the oldest hacking group in the United States, according to Reuters, and is best known for coining the term &ldquo;hacktivism&rdquo; and releasing programs that could give people remote access to computers running Microsoft Windows. The article makes clear that there&rsquo;s no indication that O&rsquo;Rourke himself ever participated in some of the group&rsquo;s more controversial hacks, although he admitted in an interview to the then-common practice of bypassing phone systems so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to pay large bills for heavy internet usage.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke and Klehr would later go on to form a punk band, Foss. O&rsquo;Rourke eventually represented El Paso in Congress from 2013-2019.</p>\n<p><em>Contact Aiden Pink at <a href=\"mailto:pink@forward.com\">pink@forward.com</a> or on Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aidenpink\">@aidenpink</a></em></p>",

Among his exploits: Publishing an interview with a Holocaust-denying neo-Nazi.\nTranscripts from the taped interview, which O\u2019Rourke published under his handle \u201cPsychedelic Warlord\u201d when he was around 16 in 1988, are still available online. The interview between O\u2019Rourke, his friend Arlo Klahr, and a leader of the Aryan Nation apparently took place in a public park in El Paso, Texas where the neo-Nazi was preaching. \u201cWe weren\u2019t really interested in his stories of Hitler or his nationality, we were trying to see what made him think the horrible things that he did,\u201d O\u2019Rourke explained in his account.\n\u201cDo you think it was wrong that Hitler committed genocide and killed six million Jews?\u201d the teens asked. (The transcript usually doesn\u2019t say which of the two asked a question)\nThe preacher, who said his last name was Ausderau, denied the historical accounts. \u201cThere were millions that were killed but they were not all Jews,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not believe that Hitler was even the cause of that\u2026.I believe that Hitler was a good man.\u201d\nAt one point, O\u2019Rourke pointed to Klahr and said, \u201cHe\u2019s Jewish. Do you think he can be saved?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Ausderau responded - he claimed that he had Jewish ancestry and \u201ca lot of good Jewish friends,\u201d and that his church celebrated Passover and had Jewish congregants. But in order to be saved, the man said, Jews must accept Jesus as their savior.\nO\u2019Rourke offered to sell tapes of the interview for $3. He also provided the address of Ausderau\u2019s church. \u201cFeel free to write a friendly message, or send them a \u2018special\u2019 package,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSurely they\u2019d appreciate some \u2018fan\u2019 mail\u2026.\u201d\nOther pieces published by O\u2019Rourke as a teenager on the Cult of the Dead Cow website include a short essay about the possibility of a money-free society and a piece of fiction in which the narrator runs over children with his car.\nThe Cult of the Dead Cow is the oldest hacking group in the United States, according to Reuters, and is best known for coining the term \u201chacktivism\u201d and releasing programs that could give people remote access to computers running Microsoft Windows. The article makes clear that there\u2019s no indication that O\u2019Rourke himself ever participated in some of the group\u2019s more controversial hacks, although he admitted in an interview to the then-common practice of bypassing phone systems so he wouldn\u2019t have to pay large bills for heavy internet usage.\nO\u2019Rourke and Klehr would later go on to form a punk band, Foss. O\u2019Rourke eventually represented El Paso in Congress from 2013-2019.\nContact Aiden Pink at pink@forward.com or on Twitter, @aidenpink",

All have long histories of working with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to advance the brand of pro-Israel legislation it favors.</p>\n<p>They include Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Chris Coons, D-Del.; Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the majority leader in the U.S. House of Representatives; Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Michael McFaul, R-Texas, that committee&rsquo;s ranking Republican.</p>\n<p>Chairing Pro-Israel America is Jonathan Missner, formerly the managing director for national affairs at AIPAC, and directing it is Jeff Mendelsohn, formerly AIPAC&rsquo;s national outreach director.</p>\n<p>Planning for the PAC was first revealed earlier this month by the <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pro-israel-lobby-aipac_n_5c7d677fe4b0a571d36eb3bc\">Huffington Post </a>and Jewish Currents. It is being unveiled just days ahead of the lobby&rsquo;s annual policy conference, and after a fraught season of congressional battles among Democrats over support for Israel, the party&rsquo;s relationship with AIPAC and whether some on the party&rsquo;s left were invoking anti-Semitic slanders.</p>\n<p>The new PAC also comes as the pro-Israel community is increasingly polarized along partisan lines. J Street&rsquo;s affiliated PAC backs Democrats who embrace the group&rsquo;s ethos that one can be pro-Israel and sharply critical of its right-wing government. On the right, meanwhile are donors who are deeply skeptical of the two-state solution, chief among them Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate and Republican kingmaker.</p>\n<p>AIPAC is careful not to openly challenge any sitting Israeli government, but also adheres to the two-state solution at a time when the Republican Party and the Israeli and American governments have retreated from it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The best way to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship is to elect pro-Israel candidates to Congress, and that requires political action from the thousands of Americans who care deeply about this issue,&rdquo; Mendelsohn said in a release. A group hewing to a similar outlook, the Democratic Majority for America, <a href=\"https://www.jta.org/quick-reads/leading-dems-launch-centrist-pro-israel-faction-to-counter-lefts-influence\">launched</a> in January and immediately took aim at those lawmakers on the party&rsquo;s left who are most critical of Israel.</p>\n<p>The PAC also comes as online small donors are increasingly influential among Democrats, reducing the influence of the old model of pro-Israel giving, which centered on bundling donations at events attracting major givers whose political giving was primarily Israel-focused.</p>\n<p>An official of the new PAC told JTA that the group&rsquo;s website would function as a portal, summarizing the pro-Israel profile of endorsed candidates, and presenting options for individual donors to directly give to the endorsed candidate, or to give to the PAC in the name of the candidate.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a one-stop shop, for people to learn about the candidates the races, to have a mechanism for the candidates they want to support,&rdquo; the candidate said.</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON (JTA) \u2014 Two former top AIPAC staffers are helming a new political action committee that will steer donations to candidates in both parties who adopt a centrist pro-Israel position, at a time when that gold standard for pro-Israel giving is being challenged by the right and the left.\nPro-Israel America launched Tuesday endorsing 27 candidates, 14 Democrats and 13 Republicans. All have long histories of working with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to advance the brand of pro-Israel legislation it favors.\nThey include Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Chris Coons, D-Del.; Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the majority leader in the U.S. House of Representatives; Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Michael McFaul, R-Texas, that committee\u2019s ranking Republican.\nChairing Pro-Israel America is Jonathan Missner, formerly the managing director for national affairs at AIPAC, and directing it is Jeff Mendelsohn, formerly AIPAC\u2019s national outreach director.\nPlanning for the PAC was first revealed earlier this month by the Huffington Post and Jewish Currents. It is being unveiled just days ahead of the lobby\u2019s annual policy conference, and after a fraught season of congressional battles among Democrats over support for Israel, the party\u2019s relationship with AIPAC and whether some on the party\u2019s left were invoking anti-Semitic slanders.\nThe new PAC also comes as the pro-Israel community is increasingly polarized along partisan lines. J Street\u2019s affiliated PAC backs Democrats who embrace the group\u2019s ethos that one can be pro-Israel and sharply critical of its right-wing government. On the right, meanwhile are donors who are deeply skeptical of the two-state solution, chief among them Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate and Republican kingmaker.\nAIPAC is careful not to openly challenge any sitting Israeli government, but also adheres to the two-state solution at a time when the Republican Party and the Israeli and American governments have retreated from it.\n\u201cThe best way to strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship is to elect pro-Israel candidates to Congress, and that requires political action from the thousands of Americans who care deeply about this issue,\u201d Mendelsohn said in a release. A group hewing to a similar outlook, the Democratic Majority for America, launched in January and immediately took aim at those lawmakers on the party\u2019s left who are most critical of Israel.\nThe PAC also comes as online small donors are increasingly influential among Democrats, reducing the influence of the old model of pro-Israel giving, which centered on bundling donations at events attracting major givers whose political giving was primarily Israel-focused.\nAn official of the new PAC told JTA that the group\u2019s website would function as a portal, summarizing the pro-Israel profile of endorsed candidates, and presenting options for individual donors to directly give to the endorsed candidate, or to give to the PAC in the name of the candidate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a one-stop shop, for people to learn about the candidates the races, to have a mechanism for the candidates they want to support,\u201d the candidate said.",

                "html": "<p>Here&rsquo;s what white supremacists said about Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson when they thought no one else was looking:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Tucker is really doing divine work.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A lone voice of reason in the media.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Tucker is a blessing, def[initely] our guy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The uproar this past week over numerous recently-uncovered insensitive comments Carlson made on a radio show overshadowed news that could have been even worse for him: A <a href=\"https://unicornriot.ninja/2019/neo-nazi-hipsters-identity-evropa-exposed-in-discord-chat-leak/\">massive leak of internal chat logs</a> from Identity Evropa, one of the leading white supremacist groups in America, showed that many members were huge fans of Carlson and the ideas he espoused every night to millions of viewers.</p>\n<p>Even though white supremacist groups themselves have <a href=\"https://forward.com/news/national/418155/white-supremacist-daily-stormer-andrew-anglin/\">largely gone underground</a> &ndash; either due to financial pressures, fear of their identities being revealed or infighting &ndash; they have continued to try to push their ideologies into the mainstream. And they see Carlson as a key component in that effort.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Tucker Carlson has long been praised by white nationalists as being one of them or supporting their talking points,&rdquo; Spencer Sunshine, an associate fellow at the think tank Political Research Associates who studies far-right movements, told the Forward.</p>\n<p>Fox News did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>In December 2018, one user <a href=\"https://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/uploader/image/2019/03/07/Screen_Shot_2019-03-07_at_12.51.35_PM.png\">described</a> a &ldquo;Twitter food chain&rdquo; where information passes from white supremacist podcasts and YouTube shows, to Rep. Steve King and commentator Ann Coulter, to Carlson, to President Trump. A similar comment was <a href=\"https://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/uploader/image/2019/03/07/Screen_Shot_2019-03-07_at_1.18.20_PM.png\">made</a> two months later: &ldquo;Tucker is basically the only funnel from the base to [Trump] at this point.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Carlson has been making racist comments for over a decade, the left-wing organization Media Matters for America <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2019/03/11/unearthed-audio-shows-tucker-carlson-using-white-nationalist-rhetoric-and-making-racist-remarks/223105\">revealed</a> this past week.</p>\n<p>During Carlson&rsquo;s weekly call-ins with shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge from 2006 to 2011, the future Fox News host made <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2019/03/11/unearthed-audio-shows-tucker-carlson-using-white-nationalist-rhetoric-and-making-racist-remarks/223105\">many remarks</a> that made distinctions between racial groups. White men, Carlson said in 2008, deserved credit for &ldquo;creating civilization&rdquo;; earlier that year, he said people in Iraq (the actual birthplace of human civilization) weren&rsquo;t behaving &ldquo;like human beings.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>White supremacists may have been primed to look for similar sentiments on Fox, and they found them. Indeed, Carlson has ramped up his rhetoric since starting his Fox News show a week after President Trump&rsquo;s election in 2016. He <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/04/27/why-neo-nazis-are-kvelling-over-tucker-carlson/216182\">quickly became a favorite of the so-called &ldquo;alt-right&rdquo;</a> and continued to make statements that could be read as either standard cultural conservatism, xenophobic fear-mongering about immigration and diversity, or outright white nationalism.</p>\n<p>However a listener hears them, however, experts say that Carlson is one of the white nationalist movement&rsquo;s best megaphones, because by using his platform to reinforce their notions, he is making them more acceptable.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Tucker Carlson probably has been the No. 1 commentator mainstreaming bedrock principles of white nationalism in this country, which is fear of immigrants, fear of Muslims, keeping them out and arguing that whites are under attack,&rdquo; Heidi Beirich, the head of the Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s Intelligence Project, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/08/15/tucker-carlson-claims-theres-no-white-nationalism-his-shows-obsessive-racism-suggests-otherwise/\">told</a> Salon last August.</p>\n<p>Carlson has amplified white nationalist phrases and talking points to his 2.8 million average viewers &ndash; including President Trump, who has echoed them.</p>\n<p>A segment last August about violence and proposed land seizures against white farmers in South Africa &ndash; a narrative <a href=\"https://forward.com/fast-forward/408782/adl-condemns-trump-for-tweeting-south-africa-white-nationalist-conspiracy/\">frequently promoted by white supremacists</a> - was glommed onto by Trump, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1032454567152246785\">tweeted</a> that he had ordered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to investigate the issue. The Anti-Defamation League was aghast, saying in a statement that it was &ldquo;extremely disturbing that the President of the United States echoed a longstanding and false white supremacist claim.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The leak last week of <a href=\"https://discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja/discord/\">more than 770,000 messages</a> in Identity Evropa&rsquo;s Discord chat forums showed that they saw the South Africa incident as a victory for their ideology. One user urged members to promote the segment on social media and turn it into a recruiting tool.</p>\n<p>Carlson has also cast himself as a defender of causes that just so happen to also be promoted by white racists &ndash; objecting to the removal of Confederate statues, defending the extremist-friendly social network Gab, criticizing the United Kingdom&rsquo;s decision to ban white supremacists from entering the country.</p>\n<p>And he also alludes to the perceived inferiority of non-white people. Last December, for example, he claimed immigrants made the United States &ldquo;dirtier,&rdquo; which led at least <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/advertisers-tucker-carlson-fox-news-1203093497/\">30 companies to say they wouldn&rsquo;t air ads on his show anymore.</a> More have left since the Media Matters investigation dropped.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Carlson has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/11/29/i-cant-reveal-my-confidential-sources-mr-wemple-the-tucker-carlson-interview/?utm_term=.aa243371375a\">frequently denied</a> that he <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_profile/tucker-carlson.php\">uses his platform</a> to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/11/29/tucker-carlson-neo-nazi-favorite/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.5f36df19cba7\">disseminate and sanitize white nationalism.</a> But many media critics &ndash; and perhaps most saliently, white nationalists themselves - continue to think he&rsquo;s doing so.</p>\n<p>Sunshine cautioned against trying to read Carlson&rsquo;s mind for proof of his ideological intentions. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s intentionally, self-consciously thinking like a white nationalist and soft-selling it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I think we can see empirically that&hellip;what he&rsquo;s saying harmonizes with white nationalist views. And we can see that when <em>they</em> say it [does].&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Indeed, a <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2019/03/08/leaked-chat-messages-show-members-white-supremacist-group-identity-evropa-are-obsessed-tucker/223083\">Media Matters analysis</a> of the Identity Evropa leaks revealed widespread adulation for Carlson.</p>\n<p>Carlson has also been praised on the white supremacist website <a href=\"https://dailystormer.name/new-batch-of-tucker-comments-is-even-better-white-people-created-civilization/\">The Daily Stormer</a> and podcasts like <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2018/11/20/tucker-carlson-hero-these-white-supremacist-podcasts/222124\">The Daily Shoah.</a> Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke declared last year that Carlson is one of &ldquo;the voices we have in the media on our side.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the extent to which Carlson continues to promote dialogue that white nationalists approve of will be governed by whether the experience chastises him &ndash; or whether the advertiser exodus forces Fox to take tighter control. So far, things appear to be continuing largely as before.</p>\n<p>Carlson was defiant on his shows this week. He said he was being targeted by a &ldquo;liberal mob.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These are the people who write our movies and our sitcoms,&rdquo; he said on Monday. &ldquo;They are not shocked by naughty words. They just pretend to be when it&rsquo;s useful. It&rsquo;s been very useful lately.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The reference to Hollywood cultural elites was <a href=\"https://forward.com/fast-forward/420795/tucker-carlson-anti-semitic-fox-news/\">interpreted by some</a> as a veiled reference to Jews.</p>\n<h3> Author </h3>",

                "text": "Here\u2019s what white supremacists said about Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson when they thought no one else was looking:\n\u201cTucker is really doing divine work.\u201d\n\u201cA lone voice of reason in the media.\u201d\n\u201cTucker is a blessing, def[initely] our guy.\u201d\nThe uproar this past week over numerous recently-uncovered insensitive comments Carlson made on a radio show overshadowed news that could have been even worse for him: A massive leak of internal chat logs from Identity Evropa, one of the leading white supremacist groups in America, showed that many members were huge fans of Carlson and the ideas he espoused every night to millions of viewers.\nEven though white supremacist groups themselves have largely gone underground \u2013 either due to financial pressures, fear of their identities being revealed or infighting \u2013 they have continued to try to push their ideologies into the mainstream. And they see Carlson as a key component in that effort.\n\u201cTucker Carlson has long been praised by white nationalists as being one of them or supporting their talking points,\u201d Spencer Sunshine, an associate fellow at the think tank Political Research Associates who studies far-right movements, told the Forward.\nFox News did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn December 2018, one user described a \u201cTwitter food chain\u201d where information passes from white supremacist podcasts and YouTube shows, to Rep. Steve King and commentator Ann Coulter, to Carlson, to President Trump. A similar comment was made two months later: \u201cTucker is basically the only funnel from the base to [Trump] at this point.\u201d\nCarlson has been making racist comments for over a decade, the left-wing organization Media Matters for America revealed this past week.\nDuring Carlson\u2019s weekly call-ins with shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge from 2006 to 2011, the future Fox News host made many remarks that made distinctions between racial groups. White men, Carlson said in 2008, deserved credit for \u201ccreating civilization\u201d; earlier that year, he said people in Iraq (the actual birthplace of human civilization) weren\u2019t behaving \u201clike human beings.\u201d\nWhite supremacists may have been primed to look for similar sentiments on Fox, and they found them. Indeed, Carlson has ramped up his rhetoric since starting his Fox News show a week after President Trump\u2019s election in 2016. He quickly became a favorite of the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d and continued to make statements that could be read as either standard cultural conservatism, xenophobic fear-mongering about immigration and diversity, or outright white nationalism.\nHowever a listener hears them, however, experts say that Carlson is one of the white nationalist movement\u2019s best megaphones, because by using his platform to reinforce their notions, he is making them more acceptable.\n\u201cTucker Carlson probably has been the No. 1 commentator mainstreaming bedrock principles of white nationalism in this country, which is fear of immigrants, fear of Muslims, keeping them out and arguing that whites are under attack,\u201d Heidi Beirich, the head of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project, told Salon last August.\nCarlson has amplified white nationalist phrases and talking points to his 2.8 million average viewers \u2013 including President Trump, who has echoed them.\nA segment last August about violence and proposed land seizures against white farmers in South Africa \u2013 a narrative frequently promoted by white supremacists - was glommed onto by Trump, who tweeted that he had ordered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to investigate the issue. The Anti-Defamation League was aghast, saying in a statement that it was \u201cextremely disturbing that the President of the United States echoed a longstanding and false white supremacist claim.\u201d\nThe leak last week of more than 770,000 messages in Identity Evropa\u2019s Discord chat forums showed that they saw the South Africa incident as a victory for their ideology. One user urged members to promote the segment on social media and turn it into a recruiting tool.\nCarlson has also cast himself as a defender of causes that just so happen to also be promoted by white racists \u2013 objecting to the removal of Confederate statues, defending the extremist-friendly social network Gab, criticizing the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to ban white supremacists from entering the country.\nAnd he also alludes to the perceived inferiority of non-white people. Last December, for example, he claimed immigrants made the United States \u201cdirtier,\u201d which led at least 30 companies to say they wouldn\u2019t air ads on his show anymore. More have left since the Media Matters investigation dropped.\nTo be sure, Carlson has frequently denied that he uses his platform to disseminate and sanitize white nationalism. But many media critics \u2013 and perhaps most saliently, white nationalists themselves - continue to think he\u2019s doing so.\nSunshine cautioned against trying to read Carlson\u2019s mind for proof of his ideological intentions. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he\u2019s intentionally, self-consciously thinking like a white nationalist and soft-selling it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we can see empirically that\u2026what he\u2019s saying harmonizes with white nationalist views. And we can see that when they say it [does].\u201d\nIndeed, a Media Matters analysis of the Identity Evropa leaks revealed widespread adulation for Carlson.\nCarlson has also been praised on the white supremacist website The Daily Stormer and podcasts like The Daily Shoah. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke declared last year that Carlson is one of \u201cthe voices we have in the media on our side.\u201d\nUltimately, the extent to which Carlson continues to promote dialogue that white nationalists approve of will be governed by whether the experience chastises him \u2013 or whether the advertiser exodus forces Fox to take tighter control. So far, things appear to be continuing largely as before.\nCarlson was defiant on his shows this week. He said he was being targeted by a \u201cliberal mob.\u201d\n\u201cThese are the people who write our movies and our sitcoms,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cThey are not shocked by naughty words. They just pretend to be when it\u2019s useful. It\u2019s been very useful lately.\u201d\nThe reference to Hollywood cultural elites was interpreted by some as a veiled reference to Jews.\nAuthor",

Why is this all my fault?'\"\n(Jason LaVeris/Getty Images)\n\"I just didn't feel like that was very fair,\" the reality star admits before going on to explain that she doesn't feel like Cutler, 35, supports her.\n\"I feel like if you were really supportive and really encouraging of everything I have going on, I would want to make time for you,\" she admitted. \"It would be a different situation, but I feel like everything I have going on is a problem.\"\nThe former Chicago Bears quarterback agreed with his wife. \"Yep. I just gotta do a better job. You're consumed with [Uncommon James] and you should be. That's how you're going to be successful and that's how you're going to run a good business.\n\"It is a lot of change this year,\" he continued. \"You going from 0 to 60 and I just gotta deal with it.\"\nIn 2017, Cavallari launched her Nashville-based jewelry company Uncommon James, which quickly expanded to a home line, Uncommon James Home, and a children's collection, Little James.\nThe E! personality also noted that she and her husband, who last played in the NFL for the Miami Dolphins in 2017, \"have basically switched roles.\"\n\"For sure. Completely,\" Cutler acknowledged. \"Whenever I was playing football you didn't pressure me.\"\n\"When you were playing football, I had to give up my whole life and I had to just live your life and I never gave you a hard time about it,\" Cavallari reminded her husband. \"It just was what it was. I was at every game and I supported you and I did everything that I was supposed to do as a wife.\n\"I feel like since I've gotten really busy, I don't have that same support from you,\" she explained to her husband. \"We gotta get back on the same page. I just don't feel like we're on the same page right now. We're having a really hard time seeing eye to eye.\"\n\"Okay. I can do that,\" Cutler assured his wife. \"It'll be fine.\"\nCavallari and Cutler tied the knot in June 2013, 10 months after welcoming son Camden Jack. The pair are also parents to son, Jaxon Wyatt, and daughter, Saylor James.\n\u201cVery Cavallari\u201d airs Sundays at 10:00 p.m. ET on E!",

The University of Southern California's Norman Lear Center <a href=\"https://learcenter.org/project/ca/\">commended</a> the liberal network for a &ldquo;compelling and powerful forum&rdquo; and praised CNN anchor Jake Tapper for offering a &ldquo;generous space&rdquo; for the Parkland students, politicians, and the NRA representative, adding that the town hall helped &ldquo;advance the national conversation on gun control and violence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Loesch took issue with that assessment on Twitter, however.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Is this a joke? Seriously,&rdquo; Loesch tweeted.</p>\n<p>The conservative pundit then shared several clips showing a hostile crowd booing and yelling &ldquo;shame on you,&rdquo; which she insisted did not &ldquo;advance the conversation on gun control.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is what happened when the cameras turned off at CNN&rsquo;s award-winning town hall. They&rsquo;re proud of it,&rdquo; Loesch wrote.</p>\n<p>She then accused CNN of purposefully setting up the town hall &ldquo;like a WWE event&rdquo; and allowing Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel to take the stage before the cameras were turned on and spent 20 minutes &ldquo;blaming law-abiding gun owners.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Loesch also alleged that a woman &ldquo;rushed to the stage to tackle me from behind&rdquo; but was stopped by someone from her detail, which prompted Tapper to ask her if she had an escort out. She insisted that CNN had captured the entire exchange on camera and called on the network to release the footage.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I showed up in good faith for genuine conversation knowing that at best, it would be a tough event. The lengths CNN went to inflame emotions &amp; exploit pain to *put on a show* is inexcusable, shameful, &amp; it&rsquo;s grotesque they&rsquo;re celebrating getting an &lsquo;award&rsquo; for their conduct,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Those with integrity would reject this absolute sham of an award. But, narratives and ratings. Congrats on the &lsquo;show,&rsquo; CNN. Applause, applause.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Loesch and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., were not entirely welcome; they were grilled by distraught students and parents affected by the shooting and unhappy with their gun stance.</p>\n<p>Sheriff Israel, who spent much of his time attacking the NRA, was suspended earlier this year by Gov. Ron DeSantis for his office&rsquo;s mishandling of the shooting and for overlooking several red flags that might have prevented the shooter from obtaining a gun.</p>\n<p>In all, 17 people were killed in the Parkland shooting.</p>",

                "text": "Nationally syndicated radio show host and National Rifle Association (NRA) spokeswoman Dana Loesch slammed the decision to honor CNN with an award for a televised town hall in which she was heckled, days after the mass shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school last year.\nOn Tuesday, CNN announced that it had received the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Television Political Journalism for its \u201cParkland Town Hall,\u201d held after the Feb. 14, 2018, massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High. The University of Southern California's Norman Lear Center commended the liberal network for a \u201ccompelling and powerful forum\u201d and praised CNN anchor Jake Tapper for offering a \u201cgenerous space\u201d for the Parkland students, politicians, and the NRA representative, adding that the town hall helped \u201cadvance the national conversation on gun control and violence.\u201d\nLoesch took issue with that assessment on Twitter, however.\n\u201cIs this a joke? Seriously,\u201d Loesch tweeted.\nThe conservative pundit then shared several clips showing a hostile crowd booing and yelling \u201cshame on you,\u201d which she insisted did not \u201cadvance the conversation on gun control.\u201d\n\u201cThis is what happened when the cameras turned off at CNN\u2019s award-winning town hall. They\u2019re proud of it,\u201d Loesch wrote.\nShe then accused CNN of purposefully setting up the town hall \u201clike a WWE event\u201d and allowing Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel to take the stage before the cameras were turned on and spent 20 minutes \u201cblaming law-abiding gun owners.\u201d\nLoesch also alleged that a woman \u201crushed to the stage to tackle me from behind\u201d but was stopped by someone from her detail, which prompted Tapper to ask her if she had an escort out. She insisted that CNN had captured the entire exchange on camera and called on the network to release the footage.\n\u201cI showed up in good faith for genuine conversation knowing that at best, it would be a tough event. The lengths CNN went to inflame emotions & exploit pain to *put on a show* is inexcusable, shameful, & it\u2019s grotesque they\u2019re celebrating getting an \u2018award\u2019 for their conduct,\u201d she continued. \u201cThose with integrity would reject this absolute sham of an award. But, narratives and ratings. Congrats on the \u2018show,\u2019 CNN. Applause, applause.\u201d\nLoesch and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., were not entirely welcome; they were grilled by distraught students and parents affected by the shooting and unhappy with their gun stance.\nSheriff Israel, who spent much of his time attacking the NRA, was suspended earlier this year by Gov. Ron DeSantis for his office\u2019s mishandling of the shooting and for overlooking several red flags that might have prevented the shooter from obtaining a gun.\nIn all, 17 people were killed in the Parkland shooting.",

Analysis suggests that if companies are going to promote a political agenda, they must be more intentional about pushing tolerance efforts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/donald-trump-jr-big-tech-companies-cant-disguise-their-gross-hypocrisy-they-are-free-speech-pretenders\"><strong>DONALD TRUMP, JR.: BIG TECH COMPANIES CAN'T DISGUISE THEIR GROSS HYPOCRISY &ndash; THEY ARE FREE SPEECH PRETENDERS</strong></a></p>\n<p>Nearly half of Lincoln&rsquo;s 2019 Viewpoint Inclusion Survey respondents believe their companies promote a political agenda &ndash; specifically, a left-leaning one, with 47.7 percent of respondents saying their respective company has a clear liberal agenda, as opposed to the 37.9 percent who reported a conservative agenda.</p>\n<p>Of these respondents, nearly half say the ideological atmosphere affects their ability to simply do their jobs. One respondent who identifies as &ldquo;very liberal&rdquo; says a previous employer in the tech industry encouraged political discussions that disrupted his work. &ldquo;There was a lot of disharmony among employees,&rdquo; the respondent said.</p>\n<p>The experiences between employees at agenda-driven companies and those whose employers do not promote a specific agenda is vastly different. At agenda-driven companies, a startling 63 percent of tech professionals report that workplace ridicule is commonplace if you disagree with a colleague &ndash; a stark contrast to the 21 percent of employees who feel that way at their apolitical workplaces.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/5824422562001\"><img alt=\"Twitter admits 'left-leaning' bias\" src=\"https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/08/20/694940094001_5824425902001_5824422562001-vs.jpg\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>One respondent who identifies as a moderate at an agenda-driven company expressed hopelessness over the issue of intolerance: &ldquo;I am happy, with the exception of my time at work where I feel like the choices I have made in my beliefs label me as stupid, a bigot, deplored, and more. ... I am coming to the conclusion that we cannot live or work together any longer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Companies that promote political agendas are not only fostering stifling work environments; they are also contributing to political radicalization much more than companies that do not push an agenda, intentionally or not.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At agenda-driven companies, a startling 63 percent of tech professionals report that workplace ridicule is commonplace if you disagree with a colleague &ndash; a stark contrast to the 21 percent of employees who feel that way at their apolitical workplaces.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Respondents on the far right and the far left indicate higher levels of intolerance in the workplace than more moderate tech professionals. Employees who identify as either &ldquo;very liberal&rdquo; or &ldquo;very conservative&rdquo; are the most likely to support the termination of fellow employees who express &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; views outside the workplace. Moderates, on the other hand, tend to disagree with the termination of employees for expressing offensive views.</p>\n<p>There also seems to be significant pressure on tech employees to either conform to their companies&rsquo; political agenda, or to leave. What&rsquo;s more, nearly half of tech employees who identify as &ldquo;very conservative&rdquo; report knowing someone who did not pursue or left a career in tech due to perceived ideological conflicts with their respective companies.</p>\n<p>One libertarian respondent mentioned that the CEO of his company explicitly asked anyone who voted for Trump in 2016 to resign. He said, &ldquo;I find that unprofessional, uncalled for, and it pretty much guarantees that the dozen conservatives working at the company are afraid of being outed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most alarming piece of data from the report is the tech industry&rsquo;s blindspot, wherein respondents who condone intolerant workplace behavior wrongly believe their companies&rsquo; atmosphere encourages viewpoint tolerance. The same respondents on the far left and the far right who say they want to see their coworkers fired for expressing offensive views outside the workplace are, paradoxically, more likely to believe that their companies value inclusion.</p>\n<p>If this dissonance is left unaddressed, workplace tension will only grow worse heading into a tumultuous 2020 presidential cycle.</p>\n<p>While the survey results reveal an epidemic of polarization and intolerance in Silicon Valley and the broader tech community, it presents an important opportunity for tech leadership to cultivate a culture of viewpoint inclusion.</p>\n<p>Lincoln Network defines viewpoint inclusion as the active, intentional practice of fostering a positive work environment for all employees that emphasizes &ldquo;intellectual humility, empathy, trust, and curiosity,&rdquo; (adapted from Heterodox Academy&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;viewpoint diversity&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>Viewpoint inclusion empowers colleagues to affirm each other&rsquo;s value to the company, regardless of personal views. If companies are going to promote a political agenda, they must actively push tolerance efforts by establishing a culture that promotes true tolerance.</p>\n<p>Of course, tech companies have every right to set their own cultural norms, including terminating employees for cultural fit issues. And any employee that exhibits racist, sexist, homophobic or bigoted behavior unquestionably has no place in a healthy and inclusive workforce.</p>\n<p>But with the 2020 election cycle already kicking into high gear, the risks are great if the tech community ignores its intolerance problem. Inaction would mean continuing to stumble down a perilous path that ratchets up internal tensions and erodes trust among many consumers.</p>\n<p>Tech companies fuel America&rsquo;s innovation engine and have incredible influence over our culture. If they choose to model tolerance and empathy in the workplace, imagine how that attitude might infuse their online platforms with the same qualities.</p>\n<p>If the tech industry takes these results to heart, and truly creates a culture of viewpoint inclusion, it could be a powerful catalyst &ndash; not just for better margins in Silicon Valley, but also for the healing of our national political discourse.</p>",

                "text": "The tech giants of Silicon Valley, particularly Google and Facebook, have faced intense criticism in recent years for promoting partisan political agendas in the workplace. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey even admitted recently that conservative employees at his company \u201cdon't feel safe to express their opinions.\u201d\nTo gain a clearer grasp of just how big a problem viewpoint intolerance is in the tech community, Lincoln Network commissioned a study that surveyed over 1900 tech professionals from across the country.\nThe results of the study, released this week, confirm a stunning level of viewpoint intolerance in the tech community. Analysis suggests that if companies are going to promote a political agenda, they must be more intentional about pushing tolerance efforts.\nDONALD TRUMP, JR.: BIG TECH COMPANIES CAN'T DISGUISE THEIR GROSS HYPOCRISY \u2013 THEY ARE FREE SPEECH PRETENDERS\nNearly half of Lincoln\u2019s 2019 Viewpoint Inclusion Survey respondents believe their companies promote a political agenda \u2013 specifically, a left-leaning one, with 47.7 percent of respondents saying their respective company has a clear liberal agenda, as opposed to the 37.9 percent who reported a conservative agenda.\nOf these respondents, nearly half say the ideological atmosphere affects their ability to simply do their jobs. One respondent who identifies as \u201cvery liberal\u201d says a previous employer in the tech industry encouraged political discussions that disrupted his work. \u201cThere was a lot of disharmony among employees,\u201d the respondent said.\nThe experiences between employees at agenda-driven companies and those whose employers do not promote a specific agenda is vastly different. At agenda-driven companies, a startling 63 percent of tech professionals report that workplace ridicule is commonplace if you disagree with a colleague \u2013 a stark contrast to the 21 percent of employees who feel that way at their apolitical workplaces.\nOne respondent who identifies as a moderate at an agenda-driven company expressed hopelessness over the issue of intolerance: \u201cI am happy, with the exception of my time at work where I feel like the choices I have made in my beliefs label me as stupid, a bigot, deplored, and more. ... I am coming to the conclusion that we cannot live or work together any longer.\u201d\nCompanies that promote political agendas are not only fostering stifling work environments; they are also contributing to political radicalization much more than companies that do not push an agenda, intentionally or not.\nAt agenda-driven companies, a startling 63 percent of tech professionals report that workplace ridicule is commonplace if you disagree with a colleague \u2013 a stark contrast to the 21 percent of employees who feel that way at their apolitical workplaces.\nRespondents on the far right and the far left indicate higher levels of intolerance in the workplace than more moderate tech professionals. Employees who identify as either \u201cvery liberal\u201d or \u201cvery conservative\u201d are the most likely to support the termination of fellow employees who express \u201coffensive\u201d views outside the workplace. Moderates, on the other hand, tend to disagree with the termination of employees for expressing offensive views.\nThere also seems to be significant pressure on tech employees to either conform to their companies\u2019 political agenda, or to leave. What\u2019s more, nearly half of tech employees who identify as \u201cvery conservative\u201d report knowing someone who did not pursue or left a career in tech due to perceived ideological conflicts with their respective companies.\nOne libertarian respondent mentioned that the CEO of his company explicitly asked anyone who voted for Trump in 2016 to resign. He said, \u201cI find that unprofessional, uncalled for, and it pretty much guarantees that the dozen conservatives working at the company are afraid of being outed.\u201d\nPerhaps the most alarming piece of data from the report is the tech industry\u2019s blindspot, wherein respondents who condone intolerant workplace behavior wrongly believe their companies\u2019 atmosphere encourages viewpoint tolerance. The same respondents on the far left and the far right who say they want to see their coworkers fired for expressing offensive views outside the workplace are, paradoxically, more likely to believe that their companies value inclusion.\nIf this dissonance is left unaddressed, workplace tension will only grow worse heading into a tumultuous 2020 presidential cycle.\nWhile the survey results reveal an epidemic of polarization and intolerance in Silicon Valley and the broader tech community, it presents an important opportunity for tech leadership to cultivate a culture of viewpoint inclusion.\nLincoln Network defines viewpoint inclusion as the active, intentional practice of fostering a positive work environment for all employees that emphasizes \u201cintellectual humility, empathy, trust, and curiosity,\u201d (adapted from Heterodox Academy\u2019s definition of \u201cviewpoint diversity\u201d).\nViewpoint inclusion empowers colleagues to affirm each other\u2019s value to the company, regardless of personal views. If companies are going to promote a political agenda, they must actively push tolerance efforts by establishing a culture that promotes true tolerance.\nOf course, tech companies have every right to set their own cultural norms, including terminating employees for cultural fit issues. And any employee that exhibits racist, sexist, homophobic or bigoted behavior unquestionably has no place in a healthy and inclusive workforce.\nBut with the 2020 election cycle already kicking into high gear, the risks are great if the tech community ignores its intolerance problem. Inaction would mean continuing to stumble down a perilous path that ratchets up internal tensions and erodes trust among many consumers.\nTech companies fuel America\u2019s innovation engine and have incredible influence over our culture. If they choose to model tolerance and empathy in the workplace, imagine how that attitude might infuse their online platforms with the same qualities.\nIf the tech industry takes these results to heart, and truly creates a culture of viewpoint inclusion, it could be a powerful catalyst \u2013 not just for better margins in Silicon Valley, but also for the healing of our national political discourse.",

Andrew Cuomo (FOX5NY)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While most attention has been focused on immigrants trying to enter the United States over America&rsquo;s southern border, there is legal migration taking place that has been largely ignored, though it may have at least as much <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/taxes\">economic</a> and political impact as the other.</p>\n<p>People are moving out of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/taxes\">high-tax states</a> to Florida and other states with lower tax burdens.</p>\n<p>Florida&rsquo;s new governor, Ron DeSantis, mentioned the movement in a speech to the Club for Growth, which describes itself as &ldquo;a national network of over 250,000 pro-growth, limited government Americans who share in the belief that prosperity and opportunity come from economic freedom.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/the-lefts-tax-refund-freakout-exposes-their-ignorance-on-taxes\"><strong>THE LEFT'S TAX REFUND FREAKOUT EXPOSES THEIR IGNORANCE ON TAXES</strong></a></p>\n<p>DeSantis says New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has accused him of stealing residents from his state. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not stealing anybody,&rdquo; said DeSantis, &ldquo;they are driving people away.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The data back him up. Chris Edwards of the Foundation for Economic Freedom, the first free-market organization in the United States, produced a research document for the Cato Institute that shows &ldquo;of the 25 highest-tax states, 24 of them had net out-migration in 2016.&rdquo; One of the states that gained from migration was Florida where &ldquo;145 households moved in for every 100 that left.</p>\n<p>DeSantis says this influx has fueled economic growth of the state, leading to a $1.4 billion revenue surplus.</p>\n<p>Economist Richard Rahn has created a chart that includes a comparison between the tax rates of New York and Florida. He writes that while New York imposes high taxes and conveys an anti-business attitude (the recent debacle with New York City losing a headquarters for Amazon is just the latest example), &ldquo;Florida imposes no state and local income taxes in addition to the federal income tax &mdash; yet Florida is booming, with a budget surplus, while New York is mired in debt. Only 50 years ago, New York had four times the population of Florida, and now Florida is larger than New York.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote><p>In Florida, the policy seems to be that if you can earn it, you get to keep more of it. That is the best prescription for economic growth and personal satisfaction.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The sound economic state of Florida is not the only subject DeSantis is touting. He won applause from the dinner crowd when he mentioned his executive orders suspending Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher and Dr. Brenda Snipes, Broward County supervisor of elections. Republicans have accused these two of manipulating votes, causing confusion and chaos over vote counting that dates back to Bush-Gore in 2000.</p>\n<p>DeSantis has other victories in his short time in office. He has named three conservatives to the state Supreme Court, transforming it from a liberal to a solid conservative majority. He has also announced plans to sign an executive order scrapping the &ldquo;common core&rdquo; public school curriculum, replacing it with a &ldquo;strong American civics&rdquo; course.</p>\n<p>As a new Florida resident, what amazes me is why high-tax states don&rsquo;t get it? The facts are there for anyone to see, except for those who deliberately refuse to see them. And that&rsquo;s the problem. In the case of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California and other Democrat-run states, ideology appears to have eclipsed reality.</p>\n<p>If Governor Cuomo thinks DeSantis is stealing residents from New York, maybe he should consider whether his policy of &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; taxpayer earnings and demanding that residents pay even more, isn&rsquo;t the real reason for the exodus.</p>\n<p>It is not a difficult question to answer. In addition to the economic benefits associated with living in Florida, the weather is a lot nicer, if you discount the occasional hurricane. While people were freezing up North during the recent polar vortex, the sunny temperatures in South Florida ranged from the 70s to the low 80s.</p>\n<p>So, keep coming New Yorkers, and others from high-tax states. Down here, the policy seems to be that if you can earn it, you get to keep more of it. That is the best prescription for economic growth and personal satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Cal Thomas is America's most widely syndicated op-ed columnist in the U.S. He is the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Expiration-Date-Empires-Superpowers-ebook/dp/B07K5KMMGP/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1GLG2MWJLNO7R&keywords=america%27s+expiration+date&qid=1567197102&s=gateway&sprefix=%22America%27s+Expir%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-1\">&ldquo;America&rsquo;s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States,&rdquo;</a> to be published Jan. 21, 2020.

                "text": "While most attention has been focused on immigrants trying to enter the United States over America\u2019s southern border, there is legal migration taking place that has been largely ignored, though it may have at least as much economic and political impact as the other.\nPeople are moving out of high-tax states to Florida and other states with lower tax burdens.\nFlorida\u2019s new governor, Ron DeSantis, mentioned the movement in a speech to the Club for Growth, which describes itself as \u201ca national network of over 250,000 pro-growth, limited government Americans who share in the belief that prosperity and opportunity come from economic freedom.\u201d\nTHE LEFT'S TAX REFUND FREAKOUT EXPOSES THEIR IGNORANCE ON TAXES\nDeSantis says New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has accused him of stealing residents from his state. \u201cI\u2019m not stealing anybody,\u201d said DeSantis, \u201cthey are driving people away.\u201d\nThe data back him up. Chris Edwards of the Foundation for Economic Freedom, the first free-market organization in the United States, produced a research document for the Cato Institute that shows \u201cof the 25 highest-tax states, 24 of them had net out-migration in 2016.\u201d One of the states that gained from migration was Florida where \u201c145 households moved in for every 100 that left.\nDeSantis says this influx has fueled economic growth of the state, leading to a $1.4 billion revenue surplus.\nEconomist Richard Rahn has created a chart that includes a comparison between the tax rates of New York and Florida. He writes that while New York imposes high taxes and conveys an anti-business attitude (the recent debacle with New York City losing a headquarters for Amazon is just the latest example), \u201cFlorida imposes no state and local income taxes in addition to the federal income tax \u2014 yet Florida is booming, with a budget surplus, while New York is mired in debt. Only 50 years ago, New York had four times the population of Florida, and now Florida is larger than New York.\u201d\nIn Florida, the policy seems to be that if you can earn it, you get to keep more of it. That is the best prescription for economic growth and personal satisfaction.\nThe sound economic state of Florida is not the only subject DeSantis is touting. He won applause from the dinner crowd when he mentioned his executive orders suspending Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher and Dr. Brenda Snipes, Broward County supervisor of elections. Republicans have accused these two of manipulating votes, causing confusion and chaos over vote counting that dates back to Bush-Gore in 2000.\nDeSantis has other victories in his short time in office. He has named three conservatives to the state Supreme Court, transforming it from a liberal to a solid conservative majority. He has also announced plans to sign an executive order scrapping the \u201ccommon core\u201d public school curriculum, replacing it with a \u201cstrong American civics\u201d course.\nAs a new Florida resident, what amazes me is why high-tax states don\u2019t get it? The facts are there for anyone to see, except for those who deliberately refuse to see them. And that\u2019s the problem. In the case of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California and other Democrat-run states, ideology appears to have eclipsed reality.\nIf Governor Cuomo thinks DeSantis is stealing residents from New York, maybe he should consider whether his policy of \u201cstealing\u201d taxpayer earnings and demanding that residents pay even more, isn\u2019t the real reason for the exodus.\nIt is not a difficult question to answer. In addition to the economic benefits associated with living in Florida, the weather is a lot nicer, if you discount the occasional hurricane. While people were freezing up North during the recent polar vortex, the sunny temperatures in South Florida ranged from the 70s to the low 80s.\nSo, keep coming New Yorkers, and others from high-tax states. Down here, the policy seems to be that if you can earn it, you get to keep more of it. That is the best prescription for economic growth and personal satisfaction.\nCal Thomas is America's most widely syndicated op-ed columnist in the U.S. He is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States,\u201d to be published Jan. 21, 2020.

However, Nunes should go back and read his Constitution.</p>\n<p>Nunes is suing <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/twitter\">Twitter</a> for $250 million. He claims that the San Francisco-based technology giant violated his First Amendment rights by censoring his Twitter posts. (While we&rsquo;re at it, let&rsquo;s dump the childish and avian word &ldquo;tweet&rdquo; &ndash; at least in this context. Birds tweet. Humans talk.)</p>\n<p>There's just one problem here: Twitter is a private corporation. The First Amendment applies to government, not companies.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/starr-nunes-lawsuit-means-accountability-for-twitter\">DEVIN NUNES' LAWSUIT WILL MOVE TWITTER INTO THE 'AGE OF ACCOUNTABILITY:' KEN STARR</a></strong></p>\n<p>I am a contributing editor at National Review Online. If socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont sent us a piece on why America needs &ldquo;Medicare-for-all,&rdquo; there is an excellent chance that we would not run it.</p>\n<p>NRO is a private organization, and it&rsquo;s safe to say that we&rsquo;re not crazy about forcing every American to become a patient of Uncle Sam, M.D. So our &ldquo;censorship&rdquo; would be as legitimate as the Huffington Post&rsquo;s refusal to publish an op-ed by Vice President Mike Pence demanding a ban on federal funds for Planned Parenthood.</p>\n<p>Now, if Sen. Sanders appeared at, say, an issue forum next June at Baruch College &ndash; which is owned by New York City&rsquo;s exhausted taxpayers &ndash; he could not and should not be forbidden from stepping up to the microphone and delivering a stirring, tear-inducing defense of &ldquo;Medicare-for-all.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Rather than improperly invoking the First Amendment, Nunes should hold a press conference or seminar and make famous the numerous conservative thinkers, commenters, and purveyors of pro-market merchandise whom Twitter has blocked.</p>\n<p>The congressman should invite people like Dennis Prager to explain how Twitter has banished ads for his online Prager University and its educational videos on history, economics and current events.</p>\n<p>Nunes should use his powerful bully pulpit to pressure, stigmatize, and embarrass Twitter. But as long as the company remains in private hands, neither litigation nor regulation is appropriate regarding whom it allows or does not allow to mount its platform and be heard.</p>\n<p>Nunes and others on the right should challenge Twitter in this sense: If it really is an open forum for any and all to express themselves, then it should behave accordingly and stop blocking voices on the right.</p>\n<p>And if Twitter wants to be a giant, left-wing megaphone, great! But it should be honest and admit: &quot;We are a liberal social media outfit. No conservatives allowed.&quot;</p>\n<p>It would be Twitter&rsquo;s right to do this. And, at least, the folks in charge of Twitter would yank themselves fully out of the liberal closet.</p>\n<p>Most important: Nunes should learn from Rupert Murdoch. Rather than sue CNN or CNBC, the media legend launched Fox News Channel and the Fox Business Network. The rest is broadcast &ndash; and ratings &ndash; history.</p>\n<p>Likewise, Nunes should encourage the center-right to pioneer alternatives to Twitter, where conservatives would be perfectly welcome to say or sell whatever they want.</p>\n<p>In other words, don't sue Twitter. Overcome it.</p>",

(While we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s dump the childish and avian word \u201ctweet\u201d \u2013 at least in this context. Birds tweet. Humans talk.)\nThere's just one problem here: Twitter is a private corporation. The First Amendment applies to government, not companies.\nDEVIN NUNES' LAWSUIT WILL MOVE TWITTER INTO THE 'AGE OF ACCOUNTABILITY:' KEN STARR\nI am a contributing editor at National Review Online. If socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont sent us a piece on why America needs \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d there is an excellent chance that we would not run it.\nNRO is a private organization, and it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019re not crazy about forcing every American to become a patient of Uncle Sam, M.D. So our \u201ccensorship\u201d would be as legitimate as the Huffington Post\u2019s refusal to publish an op-ed by Vice President Mike Pence demanding a ban on federal funds for Planned Parenthood.\nNow, if Sen. Sanders appeared at, say, an issue forum next June at Baruch College \u2013 which is owned by New York City\u2019s exhausted taxpayers \u2013 he could not and should not be forbidden from stepping up to the microphone and delivering a stirring, tear-inducing defense of \u201cMedicare-for-all.\u201d\nRather than improperly invoking the First Amendment, Nunes should hold a press conference or seminar and make famous the numerous conservative thinkers, commenters, and purveyors of pro-market merchandise whom Twitter has blocked.\nThe congressman should invite people like Dennis Prager to explain how Twitter has banished ads for his online Prager University and its educational videos on history, economics and current events.\nNunes should use his powerful bully pulpit to pressure, stigmatize, and embarrass Twitter. But as long as the company remains in private hands, neither litigation nor regulation is appropriate regarding whom it allows or does not allow to mount its platform and be heard.\nNunes and others on the right should challenge Twitter in this sense: If it really is an open forum for any and all to express themselves, then it should behave accordingly and stop blocking voices on the right.\nAnd if Twitter wants to be a giant, left-wing megaphone, great! But it should be honest and admit: \"We are a liberal social media outfit. No conservatives allowed.\"\nIt would be Twitter\u2019s right to do this. And, at least, the folks in charge of Twitter would yank themselves fully out of the liberal closet.\nMost important: Nunes should learn from Rupert Murdoch. Rather than sue CNN or CNBC, the media legend launched Fox News Channel and the Fox Business Network. The rest is broadcast \u2013 and ratings \u2013 history.\nLikewise, Nunes should encourage the center-right to pioneer alternatives to Twitter, where conservatives would be perfectly welcome to say or sell whatever they want.\nIn other words, don't sue Twitter. Overcome it.",

After outlining numerous alleged misdeeds by Trump, Cohen expressed regret and repeated the refrain &ldquo;yet I continued to work for him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cohen said he's worried that if the president doesn't win re-election, there will not be a &quot;peaceful transition of power.&quot;</p>\n<p>He stopped short of saying he had evidence that Trump's presidential campaign colluded with Russia in 2016, asserting he had only &ldquo;suspicions.&rdquo; And Republicans on the House Oversight Committee repeatedly struck at Cohen's credibility, pointing out that he is a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/ex-trump-attorney-michael-cohen-pleads-guilty-to-lying-to-congress-in-russia-probe\">convicted liar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jordan-scorches-cohen-says-he-turned-on-trump-for-not-getting-white-house-job\">suggesting he only turned on Trump after not landing a White House job</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rnc-tells-michael-cohen-to-have-fun-in-prison-as-gop-readies-war-room-to-push-back-on-testimony\"><strong>RNC TELLS MICHAEL COHEN TO &lsquo;HAVE FUN IN PRISON,&rsquo; AS GOP READIES WAR ROOM TO PUSH BACK ON TESTIMONY</strong></a></p>\n<p>&ldquo;You're behaving just like everyone else who got fired or didn't get the job they wanted,&rdquo; Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, the ranking member on the committee, said. Cohen denied this to be the case.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/6007862176001\"><img alt=\"'Shame on you, Mr. Jordan': Cohen hits Republican for saying he has no remorse for crimes\" src=\"https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/02/27/694940094001_6007867482001_6007862176001-vs.jpg\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>The fiery testimony marked a remarkable turn for someone who once claimed he'd be willing to take a bullet for Trump.</p>\n<p>Cohen came to the hearing with a slew of exhibits, including checks he says are proof for his previous claims that Trump organized hush-money payments to two women, including adult film star Stormy Daniels, who claimed affairs with Trump during the campaign. He accused Trump of being involved in a &ldquo;criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&quot;I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later,&rdquo; said Cohen, who worked as Trump's personal lawyer.</p>\n<p>He waded into the investigation over Russia&rsquo;s meddling in the 2016 election, accusing Trump of knowing that an adviser, Roger Stone, was reaching out to WikiLeaks about the publication of stolen Democratic National Committee emails during the campaign. Trump has denied advance knowledge.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Stone denied the claim, telling Fox News: &ldquo;Mr. Cohen's statement is not true.&quot; WikiLeaks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/1100820252450082818\">also released</a> a statement saying, &quot;WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange has never had a telephone call with Roger Stone.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen did not claim Trump directed those communications. He specifically asserted that he lacks direct evidence of improper collusion by the Trump campaign with Russia.</p>\n<p>&quot;Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia,&quot; Cohen testified. &quot;I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions.&quot;</p>\n<p>Still, Democrats pushed an unproven theory that Trump, along with his family, could be compromised by the Russians. &quot;Is it possible the whole family is conflicted or compromised with a foreign adversary in the months before the election?&rdquo; Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, asked Cohen. Wasserman led the committee when emails were hacked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cohen replied.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/6007844945001\"><img alt=\"Michael Cohen: President Trump is a racist, conman and cheat\" src=\"https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/02/27/694940094001_6007845288001_6007844945001-vs.jpg\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>Under questioning from Illinois Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Cohen suggested the Southern District of New York could be investigating the president for other crimes. &ldquo;Is there any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven&rsquo;t yet discussed today?&rdquo; Krishnamoorthi asked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes and again those are part of the investigation currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York,&rdquo; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>The hearing also saw sniping among lawmakers. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., called out Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., after Meadows brought Lynne Patton, a Trump administration staffer, who is black, to push back against Cohen's allegations during his testimony that the president is a racist.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/6008091797001\"><img alt=\"Reps.

Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, claimed Trump reported inflated estimates of his assets to insurance companies.</p>\n<p>Cohen said he began questioning his loyalty to Trump after the Trump-Putin summit in Helskini in 2018 and the deadly protest violence in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.</p>\n<p>The much-awaited hearing began with fireworks, as Republicans portrayed Cohen as a liar and unsuccessfully moved to postpone the hearing. In his opening statement, Democratic Chairman Elijah Cummings acknowledged that Cohen &ldquo;repeatedly lied in the past,&rdquo; calling it an &ldquo;important factor we need to weigh.&rdquo; He said if Cohen doesn&rsquo;t tell the truth, he&rsquo;ll refer him to the Justice Department for prosecution.</p>\n<p>But Cummings said the hearing is important for understanding the president&rsquo;s past actions, saying &ldquo;the days of this committee protecting the president at all costs are over.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jordan, the ranking member on the committee, ripped Democrats for calling Cohen to testify, accusing Democrats of holding the hearing so they can later try to impeach the president.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The first announced witness for the 116th Congress is a guy who is going to prison in two months for lying to Congress,&rdquo; Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Cohen admitted telling falsities in the past, but said he was coming clean: &quot;I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man.&quot; He said he would not ask for or accept a pardon from Trump.</p>\n<p>Among other claims, Cohen on Wednesday pointed to an &quot;unusual&quot; episode in Trump Tower in approximately June 2016, when Donald Trump, Jr. supposedly whispered about a &quot;meeting&quot; in Trump's ear -- followed allegedly by Trump's reply, &quot;Ok, good. Let me know.&quot;</p>\n<p>According to Cohen, &quot;nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr. Trump&rsquo;s knowledge and approval.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lindsey-graham-slams-dems-for-hitting-new-low-for-holding-cohen-hearing-during-trumps-north-korea-summit\"><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM SLAMS DEMS FOR HITTING 'NEW LOW' BY HOLDING COHEN HEARING DURING TRUMP'S NORTH KOREA SUMMIT</strong></a></p>\n<p>&ldquo;So, I concluded that Don Jr. was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad&rsquo;s desk that day,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>That meeting has long been a subject of contention, with participants supposedly promised dirt on Clinton, despite subsequent claims that the meeting dealt instead with other topics. Trump has maintained that he did not know in advance about the meeting -- backing up Trump Jr., who told the Senate Judiciary Committee the same thing in September 2017 and would face potential criminal liability if he were lying.</p>\n<p>Cohen outlined a slew of other alleged misdeeds by Trump, including lying about his total assets to reduce his taxes and even trying to strong-arm academic officials into keeping his SAT scores and grades secret. And he repeatedly accused Trump of racism.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/6007830874001\"><img alt=\"Cohen hearing opens with fireworks as Republicans move to postpone testimony\" src=\"https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/02/27/694940094001_6007828436001_6007830874001-vs.jpg\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way,&rdquo; Cohen said. &ldquo;And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Early Wednesday, Trump tweeted that Cohen was &quot;lying in order to reduce his prison time,&quot; and referred to published reports that Cohen had been disbarred by the New York State Supreme Court. The president was tweeting from Hanoi, Vietnam -- where he is attending a summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>\n<p>As the hearing began Wednesday, Meadows interrupted to say Cohen&rsquo;s prepared testimony was not received by the committee 24 hours in advance in violation of committee rules, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-try-to-derail-michael-cohen-hearing-over-late-release-of-testimony-evidence\">calling for a postponement of the hearing.</a></p>\n<p>&quot;It was an intentional effort by this witness and his advisers to once again show his disdain for this body,&quot; Meadows said. Cummings admitted the committee received the testimony &ldquo;late last night.&rdquo; The Democratic-controlled committee voted to reject the GOP call to postpone.</p>\n<p>Cohen, under questioning from Republicans, admitted he spoke with Democratic leaders in Congress, including Cummings and Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff, before his testimony.</p>\n<p>As for his future, Cohen would not rule out making money on a book or movie deal or as a paid television commentator. He said he would not rule out running for office in New York one day.</p>\n<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s hearing is one of three congressional hearings this week where Cohen is expected to testify against his former boss. He testified Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and on Thursday, Cohen appears before the House Intelligence Committee &ndash; though both are behind closed doors.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s presidential campaign blasted Cohen in a statement Wednesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Michael Cohen is a felon, a disbarred lawyer, and a convicted perjurer, who lied to both Congress and the Special Counsel in a &lsquo;deliberate and premeditated&rsquo; fashion according to the special counsel&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. &ldquo;Now he offers what he says is evidence, but the only support for that is his own testimony, which has proven before to be worthless.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cohen was originally scheduled to report to jail on March 6 to begin serving a three-year sentence after he pleaded guilty to campaign finance and other violations last year. He is now scheduled to report to jail May 6.</p>\n<p>In December, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress. He agreed to cooperate with prosecutors as part of a deal. The charges against Cohen arose from two separate investigations &ndash; one by federal prosecutors in New York, and the other by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.</p>\n<p><em>Fox News&rsquo; Lillian LeCroy, Frank Miles, Gregg Re and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p>",

                "text": "Michael Cohen, the former fixer about to begin a three-year prison term, issued a stern denunciation of President Trump during an explosive congressional hearing Wednesday that left no room for reconciliation \u2013 calling his former boss a racist, testifying he was aware of an adviser's talks with WikiLeaks about stolen Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign and alleging he oversaw an array of illicit schemes during the 10 years they worked together.\n\u201cHe is a racist. He is a conman. And he is a cheat,\u201d Cohen testified, setting the tone for the hearing. After outlining numerous alleged misdeeds by Trump, Cohen expressed regret and repeated the refrain \u201cyet I continued to work for him.\u201d\nCohen said he's worried that if the president doesn't win re-election, there will not be a \"peaceful transition of power.\"\nHe stopped short of saying he had evidence that Trump's presidential campaign colluded with Russia in 2016, asserting he had only \u201csuspicions.\u201d And Republicans on the House Oversight Committee repeatedly struck at Cohen's credibility, pointing out that he is a convicted liar and suggesting he only turned on Trump after not landing a White House job.\nRNC TELLS MICHAEL COHEN TO \u2018HAVE FUN IN PRISON,\u2019 AS GOP READIES WAR ROOM TO PUSH BACK ON TESTIMONY\n\u201cYou're behaving just like everyone else who got fired or didn't get the job they wanted,\u201d Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, the ranking member on the committee, said. Cohen denied this to be the case.\nThe fiery testimony marked a remarkable turn for someone who once claimed he'd be willing to take a bullet for Trump.\nCohen came to the hearing with a slew of exhibits, including checks he says are proof for his previous claims that Trump organized hush-money payments to two women, including adult film star Stormy Daniels, who claimed affairs with Trump during the campaign. He accused Trump of being involved in a \u201ccriminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws.\u201d\n\"I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later,\u201d said Cohen, who worked as Trump's personal lawyer.\nHe waded into the investigation over Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election, accusing Trump of knowing that an adviser, Roger Stone, was reaching out to WikiLeaks about the publication of stolen Democratic National Committee emails during the campaign. Trump has denied advance knowledge.\nOn Wednesday, Stone denied the claim, telling Fox News: \u201cMr. Cohen's statement is not true.\" WikiLeaks also released a statement saying, \"WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange has never had a telephone call with Roger Stone.\"\nCohen did not claim Trump directed those communications. He specifically asserted that he lacks direct evidence of improper collusion by the Trump campaign with Russia.\n\"Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia,\" Cohen testified. \"I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions.\"\nStill, Democrats pushed an unproven theory that Trump, along with his family, could be compromised by the Russians. \"Is it possible the whole family is conflicted or compromised with a foreign adversary in the months before the election?\u201d Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, asked Cohen. Wasserman led the committee when emails were hacked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cohen replied.\nUnder questioning from Illinois Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Cohen suggested the Southern District of New York could be investigating the president for other crimes. \u201cIs there any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven\u2019t yet discussed today?\u201d Krishnamoorthi asked.\n\u201cYes and again those are part of the investigation currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York,\u201d Cohen said.\nThe hearing also saw sniping among lawmakers. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., called out Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., after Meadows brought Lynne Patton, a Trump administration staffer, who is black, to push back against Cohen's allegations during his testimony that the president is a racist.\n\"Just because someone has a person of color, a black person working for them does not mean that they aren't racist,\" Tlaib said.\n\"And it is insensitive...the fact that someone would actually use a prop, a black woman in this chamber, in this committee, is alone racist in itself,\" Tlaib continued.\nMeadows refuted it and said he was offended.\n\"There\u2019s nothing more personal to me than my relations \u2026 my niece and nephew are people of color, not many people know that,\" Meadows said. \"And to indicate that I asked someone who is a personal friend of the Trump family \u2026 that\u2019s she\u2019s coming in to be a prop, it\u2019s racist to suggest that I asked her to come in for that reason.\"\nCohen, under questioning from New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, claimed Trump reported inflated estimates of his assets to insurance companies.\nCohen said he began questioning his loyalty to Trump after the Trump-Putin summit in Helskini in 2018 and the deadly protest violence in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.\nThe much-awaited hearing began with fireworks, as Republicans portrayed Cohen as a liar and unsuccessfully moved to postpone the hearing. In his opening statement, Democratic Chairman Elijah Cummings acknowledged that Cohen \u201crepeatedly lied in the past,\u201d calling it an \u201cimportant factor we need to weigh.\u201d He said if Cohen doesn\u2019t tell the truth, he\u2019ll refer him to the Justice Department for prosecution.\nBut Cummings said the hearing is important for understanding the president\u2019s past actions, saying \u201cthe days of this committee protecting the president at all costs are over.\u201d\nJordan, the ranking member on the committee, ripped Democrats for calling Cohen to testify, accusing Democrats of holding the hearing so they can later try to impeach the president.\n\u201cThe first announced witness for the 116th Congress is a guy who is going to prison in two months for lying to Congress,\u201d Jordan said.\nCohen admitted telling falsities in the past, but said he was coming clean: \"I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man.\" He said he would not ask for or accept a pardon from Trump.\nAmong other claims, Cohen on Wednesday pointed to an \"unusual\" episode in Trump Tower in approximately June 2016, when Donald Trump, Jr. supposedly whispered about a \"meeting\" in Trump's ear -- followed allegedly by Trump's reply, \"Ok, good. Let me know.\"\nAccording to Cohen, \"nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr. Trump\u2019s knowledge and approval.\u201d\nLINDSEY GRAHAM SLAMS DEMS FOR HITTING 'NEW LOW' BY HOLDING COHEN HEARING DURING TRUMP'S NORTH KOREA SUMMIT\n\u201cSo, I concluded that Don Jr. was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad\u2019s desk that day,\" he said.\nThat meeting has long been a subject of contention, with participants supposedly promised dirt on Clinton, despite subsequent claims that the meeting dealt instead with other topics. Trump has maintained that he did not know in advance about the meeting -- backing up Trump Jr., who told the Senate Judiciary Committee the same thing in September 2017 and would face potential criminal liability if he were lying.\nCohen outlined a slew of other alleged misdeeds by Trump, including lying about his total assets to reduce his taxes and even trying to strong-arm academic officials into keeping his SAT scores and grades secret. And he repeatedly accused Trump of racism.\n\u201cWhile we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAnd, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him.\u201d\nEarly Wednesday, Trump tweeted that Cohen was \"lying in order to reduce his prison time,\" and referred to published reports that Cohen had been disbarred by the New York State Supreme Court. The president was tweeting from Hanoi, Vietnam -- where he is attending a summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nAs the hearing began Wednesday, Meadows interrupted to say Cohen\u2019s prepared testimony was not received by the committee 24 hours in advance in violation of committee rules, calling for a postponement of the hearing.\n\"It was an intentional effort by this witness and his advisers to once again show his disdain for this body,\" Meadows said. Cummings admitted the committee received the testimony \u201clate last night.\u201d The Democratic-controlled committee voted to reject the GOP call to postpone.\nCohen, under questioning from Republicans, admitted he spoke with Democratic leaders in Congress, including Cummings and Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff, before his testimony.\nAs for his future, Cohen would not rule out making money on a book or movie deal or as a paid television commentator. He said he would not rule out running for office in New York one day.\nWednesday\u2019s hearing is one of three congressional hearings this week where Cohen is expected to testify against his former boss. He testified Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and on Thursday, Cohen appears before the House Intelligence Committee \u2013 though both are behind closed doors.\nTrump\u2019s presidential campaign blasted Cohen in a statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\u201cMichael Cohen is a felon, a disbarred lawyer, and a convicted perjurer, who lied to both Congress and the Special Counsel in a \u2018deliberate and premeditated\u2019 fashion according to the special counsel\u2019s office,\u201d press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. \u201cNow he offers what he says is evidence, but the only support for that is his own testimony, which has proven before to be worthless.\u201d\nCohen was originally scheduled to report to jail on March 6 to begin serving a three-year sentence after he pleaded guilty to campaign finance and other violations last year. He is now scheduled to report to jail May 6.\nIn December, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress. He agreed to cooperate with prosecutors as part of a deal. The charges against Cohen arose from two separate investigations \u2013 one by federal prosecutors in New York, and the other by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\nFox News\u2019 Lillian LeCroy, Frank Miles, Gregg Re and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

But we're not there yet.&quot;</p>\n<p>Pelosi made her remarks one day after telling members of her caucus on a conference call that there were no immediate plans to move forward with impeachment, saying: &quot;We don&rsquo;t have to go to articles of impeachment to obtain the facts, the presentation of facts.&quot; On Tuesday, Pelosi said that 177 House Democrats &quot;were on the call for 87 minutes, 70 minutes at least of that was listening to the comments of 20 members who called in ...&quot;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-holds-urgent-conference-call-as-dems-scramble-to-fix-brewing-fracture-on-impeachment\"><strong>DEM LEADERS REJECT IMMEDIATE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS IN URGENT CONFERENCE CALL</strong></a></p>\n<p>&quot;There are many ways to hold the president of the United States accountable,&quot; Pelosi added. &quot; ...This is about being totally free from passion, from prejudice, from politics It's about the presentation of the facts, and when we have the facts, we'll have a better idea about how we go forward.&quot;</p>\n<p>At least three Democratic presidential candidates -- Sen.

But we're not there yet.\"\nPelosi made her remarks one day after telling members of her caucus on a conference call that there were no immediate plans to move forward with impeachment, saying: \"We don\u2019t have to go to articles of impeachment to obtain the facts, the presentation of facts.\" On Tuesday, Pelosi said that 177 House Democrats \"were on the call for 87 minutes, 70 minutes at least of that was listening to the comments of 20 members who called in ...\"\nDEM LEADERS REJECT IMMEDIATE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS IN URGENT CONFERENCE CALL\n\"There are many ways to hold the president of the United States accountable,\" Pelosi added. \" ...This is about being totally free from passion, from prejudice, from politics It's about the presentation of the facts, and when we have the facts, we'll have a better idea about how we go forward.\"\nAt least three Democratic presidential candidates -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California, as well as former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro -- have called on Congress to launch impeachment proceedings. Their demands have been backed by two prominent freshman Democrats, Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.\nOn Tuesday, Pelosi played down reports of divisions among Democrats over the impeachment issue, saying: \"There are some people who are more eager for impeachment, many more eager to just follow the investigation \u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a growing number [who support impeachment.]\"\nHOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN SUBPOENAS EX-WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON MCGAHN\nShortly before the House Democratic conference call began, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., subpoenaed former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify next month. Nadler also issued a subpoena last week for the full, unredacted version of the Mueller report. House Democrats have refused invitations by Attorney General William Barr to come to its headquarters and read a less-redacted version of the report.\nOn Tuesday, Pelosi accused the White House of \"stonewalling\" after lawyers for Trump sued to block a subpoena issued by the House Oversight Committee seeking the president's financial records.\n\"This is a moment in our history,\" the speaker said. \"As I say, it\u2019s not about politics. It\u2019s about patriotism. It\u2019s an existential threat, this administration, to our democracy in terms of our Constitution, Article I, the legislative branch [as] spelled out in the Constitution, the power of oversight over other branches of government, [and] the right to know.\"\nFox News' Mike Emanuel contributed to this report.",
