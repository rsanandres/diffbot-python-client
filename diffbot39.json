Anyone who lacks the basic level of human compassion needed to vote in favor of this should quickly find another job.&quot;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wnd.com/2019/02/james-dobson-sen-murray-telling-outright-lie/\">WND reported</a> when James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family and the <a href=\"https://www.dobsonfamilyinstitute.com/\">James Dobson Family Institute</a>, the author of dozens of books on family and adviser to at least five presidents, commented just before the vote.</p>\n<p>&quot;I am truly saddened that we as a country would even have need to protect a child who has survived the horrors of an attempted abortion and has been left to die on a porcelain tray. Shockingly, despite what some politicians like Sen. [Patty] Murray would have you believe, we do not currently have federal protection for babies who have survived such a procedure,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Politicians such as Sen. Murray would have you believe that this bill is an affront to a woman's 'health,'&quot; he said. That's an outright lie and Sen. Murray knows this. She should be ashamed of herself for spreading such a fallacy. This has nothing to do with women's health, but with the health of a precious, struggling newborn gasping for breath after attempted murder,&quot; Dobson charged.</p>\n<p>The abandonment of babies who survive abortion procedures was endorsed by Barack Obama while he was a state lawmaker in Illinois.</p>\n<p>As president, his administration <a href=\"http://wnd.com/2016/02/obama-picks-side-in-hail-satan-abortion-fight/\">argued in court on the side of the mob that chanted &quot;hail Satan&quot; in 2013</a> in opposition to a Texas bill banning abortion after 20 weeks.</p>\n<p><em>A video of the hail Satan chant:</em></p>\n<p><em>Another:</em></p>",

He betrayed the universal truth of human dignity and he turned the stomachs of civilized people not just in this country but in every country on Earth,\" Sasse said.\nThe Gateway Pundit blog said: \"This means babies could potentially be murdered in the birth canal and if they are born alive \u2014 several Democrats RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT support it \u2014 truly scary and barbaric.\"\nFox News said conservatives were wondering \"whether Democrats were embracing 'infanticide' to appeal to left-wing voters.\"\nThe Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would have required that \"any health care practitioner present\" at a birth use \"the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.\"\n\"Senators who could not bring themselves to vote to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act should reconsider whether or not they have what it takes to serve,\" March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said in a statement. \"Senator Sasse's common sense bill would merely require doctors assist a newborn struggling to survive after a failed attempt on her life. Anyone who lacks the basic level of human compassion needed to vote in favor of this should quickly find another job.\"\nWND reported when James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family and the James Dobson Family Institute, the author of dozens of books on family and adviser to at least five presidents, commented just before the vote.\n\"I am truly saddened that we as a country would even have need to protect a child who has survived the horrors of an attempted abortion and has been left to die on a porcelain tray. Shockingly, despite what some politicians like Sen. [Patty] Murray would have you believe, we do not currently have federal protection for babies who have survived such a procedure,\" he said.\n\"Politicians such as Sen. Murray would have you believe that this bill is an affront to a woman's 'health,'\" he said. That's an outright lie and Sen. Murray knows this. She should be ashamed of herself for spreading such a fallacy. This has nothing to do with women's health, but with the health of a precious, struggling newborn gasping for breath after attempted murder,\" Dobson charged.\nThe abandonment of babies who survive abortion procedures was endorsed by Barack Obama while he was a state lawmaker in Illinois.\nAs president, his administration argued in court on the side of the mob that chanted \"hail Satan\" in 2013 in opposition to a Texas bill banning abortion after 20 weeks.\nA video of the hail Satan chant:\nAnother:",

Jared Polis is poised to hand over his state's power to elect presidents to major population centers.</p>\n<p>Polis is scheduled to sign the National Popular Vote bill, which recently was approved by the Democratic-controlled majorities in the state House and Senate.</p>\n<p>It would give Colorado's nine Electoral College votes to the candidate with the most popular votes nationwide.</p>\n<p><strong>TRENDING:</strong> <a data-type=\"Internal link\" data-type-location=\"in-content-trending\" href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2020/02/nbc-reporter-refuses-quiet-gop-impeachment-hero-elise-stefanik-steps-crushes/\">When NBC reporter refuses to be quiet, GOP impeachment hero Elise Stefanik steps in and crushes her</a></p>\n<p>The plan already has been adopted by nearly a dozen states. But there are not enough yet to give the popular-vote winner the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.</p>\n<p>Democrats in New Mexico, however, already are moving on an NPV bill, and several other states are considering one.</p>\n<p>Bypassing the Electoral College would make the major urban centers that lean heavily Democratic the focus of election campaigns.</p>\n<p>There would be no need for a presidential candidate to campaign in states such as Wyoming, Nebraska or North Dakota.</p>\n<p>WND contacted Polis' office but received no response.</p>\n<p>Questions posed by WND included the concerns of state Colorado state Rep. Jerry Sonnenberg, who said, &quot;Why would we want to cede any of our power to what the national popular vote says, to what California says, to what New York says?&quot;</p>\n<p>WND also asked how a national popular vote would affect the ability of Colorado voters to influence national elections.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sovereignnations.com/2019/02/04/electoral-college-state-senate-presidential-votes/\">At the Sovereigns Nation blog, Desmond Berg raised similar questions</a>.</p>\n<p>&quot;There's a reason only large or Democratic-controlled states are moving in this direction &mdash; Hillary Clinton would be president now under this system,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It gives all the power to elect presidents to heavily populated states, and silences the voice of flyover country overwhelmingly populated by Republicans.</p>\n<p>&quot;Republican State Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg of Sterling says this bill would abdicate Colorado's voice in presidential elections, and he's right,&quot; he said. &quot;Republicans tried to drive home their point by jokingly suggesting language stating Colorado would just be surrendering their vote to California. It would be funnier if it weren't actually true.&quot;</p>\n<p>In a comment in the forum under the article, George Webb demanded the &quot;names of the persons in Colorado Senate that took my right away to vote for the person I feel is most qualified to be President of the United States.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I did not give up my right and would not give up my right to vote . Person's stealing my rights should be locked up as a criminal because they are stealing my voice,&quot; he wrote. &quot;No one has the right to do that and I will fight that to the death.&quot;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wnd.com/2019/02/dems-launch-torpedoes-at-electoral-college/\">The Constitution gives states the right to determine their electors and how they vote. </a></p>\n<p>The chairman of the non-profit National Popular Vote Inc., <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-op-0227-npv-pairing-con-20190226-story.html\">John Koza, wrote in an editorial for the Baltimore Sun</a> that the NPV plan would make every vote for president &quot;equal&quot; and would force presidential candidates to campaign in all 50 states.</p>\n<p>But that would assume a candidate calculates that a visit to Casper, Wyoming, or North Platte, Nebraska, would reach as many voters as an event in New York City or Chicago.</p>\n<p>Election expert Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation calls the NPV compact &quot;unconstitutional and bad public policy.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;It would undermine the protections of the Electoral College, elevating the importance of big urban centers like New York and Los Angeles while diminishing the influence of smaller states and rural areas,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>&quot;That was a major reason for establishing the Electoral College in the first place: to prevent elections from becoming contests where presidential candidates would simply campaign in big cities for votes.&quot;</p>\n<p>Under the present allocation of Electoral College votes, which could change depending on population shifts, the NPV would predetermine the result of any national election if California (55), Texas (34), New York (31), Florida (27), Pennsylvania (21), Illinois (21), Ohio (20), Michigan (17) and North Carolina, New Jersey and Georgia (15 each) agreed.</p>\n<p>That would total 271 Electoral College votes, unbeatable by the total from the other 39 states.</p>\n<p>The Washington Free Beacon noted that if Idaho &quot;had been in the compact in 2016, and if the compact were in force, the state's four Electoral College votes would have been cast for Hillary Clinton even though Donald Trump beat her by more than a two-to-one margin there, because Clinton won more votes nationwide.&quot;</p>\n<p>Rob Natelson, a constitutional scholar in Colorado, published a lengthy argument against the NPV, the Free Beacon reported.</p>\n<p>Natelson wrote: &quot;In deciding how electors are appointed, state lawmakers may choose among a range of procedures. But they have a constitutional duty to choose a method consistent with the electoral system's purpose and design. Attempting to convert electors into agents of <i>other</i> states &ndash; like selling them to the highest bidder &ndash; would be an unconstitutional breach of public trust.&quot;</p>\n<p>The late conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly <a href=\"http://wnd.com/2011/12/374709/\">once said</a> the NPV is trying to &quot;achieve the longtime liberal goal of getting rid of the Electoral College&quot; without a constitutional amendment, which would be nearly impossible to obtain.</p>\n<p>She said the NPV &quot;is a scheme to deviously bypass the grand design of our U.S. Constitution.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;If the NPV lobbyists can get enough states whose votes in the Electoral College total at least 270, they will be able to steal votes away from some candidates, transfer those votes to another candidate and thereby construct a fake majority in the Electoral College,&quot; Schlafly said.</p>\n<p>&quot;The NPV slogan 'Every Vote Equal' is dishonest because the NPV proposal is based on legalizing vote-stealing. For example, Texas or Louisiana could be forced to cast its votes for a candidate who won more votes in other states, such as New York.</p>\n<p>&quot;People who pretend that the Electoral College system is undemocratic are not only ignorant of the history and purposes of the U.S. Constitution, but they probably don't even understand baseball. Basing the election on a plurality of the popular vote while ignoring the states would be like the New York Yankees claiming they won the 1960 World Series because they outscored the Pirates in runs 55-27 and in hits 91-60. Yet, the Pirates fairly won that World Series, 4 games to 3, and no one challenges their victory.&quot;</p>\n<p>So far, virtually all of the states that have joined the movement are Democratic-majority.</p>",

                "text": "Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis is poised to hand over his state's power to elect presidents to major population centers.\nPolis is scheduled to sign the National Popular Vote bill, which recently was approved by the Democratic-controlled majorities in the state House and Senate.\nIt would give Colorado's nine Electoral College votes to the candidate with the most popular votes nationwide.\nTRENDING: When NBC reporter refuses to be quiet, GOP impeachment hero Elise Stefanik steps in and crushes her\nThe plan already has been adopted by nearly a dozen states. But there are not enough yet to give the popular-vote winner the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.\nDemocrats in New Mexico, however, already are moving on an NPV bill, and several other states are considering one.\nBypassing the Electoral College would make the major urban centers that lean heavily Democratic the focus of election campaigns.\nThere would be no need for a presidential candidate to campaign in states such as Wyoming, Nebraska or North Dakota.\nWND contacted Polis' office but received no response.\nQuestions posed by WND included the concerns of state Colorado state Rep. Jerry Sonnenberg, who said, \"Why would we want to cede any of our power to what the national popular vote says, to what California says, to what New York says?\"\nWND also asked how a national popular vote would affect the ability of Colorado voters to influence national elections.\nAt the Sovereigns Nation blog, Desmond Berg raised similar questions.\n\"There's a reason only large or Democratic-controlled states are moving in this direction \u2014 Hillary Clinton would be president now under this system,\" he wrote. \"It gives all the power to elect presidents to heavily populated states, and silences the voice of flyover country overwhelmingly populated by Republicans.\n\"Republican State Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg of Sterling says this bill would abdicate Colorado's voice in presidential elections, and he's right,\" he said. \"Republicans tried to drive home their point by jokingly suggesting language stating Colorado would just be surrendering their vote to California. It would be funnier if it weren't actually true.\"\nIn a comment in the forum under the article, George Webb demanded the \"names of the persons in Colorado Senate that took my right away to vote for the person I feel is most qualified to be President of the United States.\"\n\"I did not give up my right and would not give up my right to vote . Person's stealing my rights should be locked up as a criminal because they are stealing my voice,\" he wrote. \"No one has the right to do that and I will fight that to the death.\"\nThe Constitution gives states the right to determine their electors and how they vote.\nThe chairman of the non-profit National Popular Vote Inc., John Koza, wrote in an editorial for the Baltimore Sun that the NPV plan would make every vote for president \"equal\" and would force presidential candidates to campaign in all 50 states.\nBut that would assume a candidate calculates that a visit to Casper, Wyoming, or North Platte, Nebraska, would reach as many voters as an event in New York City or Chicago.\nElection expert Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation calls the NPV compact \"unconstitutional and bad public policy.\"\n\"It would undermine the protections of the Electoral College, elevating the importance of big urban centers like New York and Los Angeles while diminishing the influence of smaller states and rural areas,\" he said.\n\"That was a major reason for establishing the Electoral College in the first place: to prevent elections from becoming contests where presidential candidates would simply campaign in big cities for votes.\"\nUnder the present allocation of Electoral College votes, which could change depending on population shifts, the NPV would predetermine the result of any national election if California (55), Texas (34), New York (31), Florida (27), Pennsylvania (21), Illinois (21), Ohio (20), Michigan (17) and North Carolina, New Jersey and Georgia (15 each) agreed.\nThat would total 271 Electoral College votes, unbeatable by the total from the other 39 states.\nThe Washington Free Beacon noted that if Idaho \"had been in the compact in 2016, and if the compact were in force, the state's four Electoral College votes would have been cast for Hillary Clinton even though Donald Trump beat her by more than a two-to-one margin there, because Clinton won more votes nationwide.\"\nRob Natelson, a constitutional scholar in Colorado, published a lengthy argument against the NPV, the Free Beacon reported.\nNatelson wrote: \"In deciding how electors are appointed, state lawmakers may choose among a range of procedures. But they have a constitutional duty to choose a method consistent with the electoral system's purpose and design. Attempting to convert electors into agents of other states \u2013 like selling them to the highest bidder \u2013 would be an unconstitutional breach of public trust.\"\nThe late conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly once said the NPV is trying to \"achieve the longtime liberal goal of getting rid of the Electoral College\" without a constitutional amendment, which would be nearly impossible to obtain.\nShe said the NPV \"is a scheme to deviously bypass the grand design of our U.S. Constitution.\"\n\"If the NPV lobbyists can get enough states whose votes in the Electoral College total at least 270, they will be able to steal votes away from some candidates, transfer those votes to another candidate and thereby construct a fake majority in the Electoral College,\" Schlafly said.\n\"The NPV slogan 'Every Vote Equal' is dishonest because the NPV proposal is based on legalizing vote-stealing. For example, Texas or Louisiana could be forced to cast its votes for a candidate who won more votes in other states, such as New York.\n\"People who pretend that the Electoral College system is undemocratic are not only ignorant of the history and purposes of the U.S. Constitution, but they probably don't even understand baseball. Basing the election on a plurality of the popular vote while ignoring the states would be like the New York Yankees claiming they won the 1960 World Series because they outscored the Pirates in runs 55-27 and in hits 91-60. Yet, the Pirates fairly won that World Series, 4 games to 3, and no one challenges their victory.\"\nSo far, virtually all of the states that have joined the movement are Democratic-majority.",

The wrong one can be like a wolf in sheep's clothing filling the inmate's mind with a radical ideology that pushes him or her down the road to jihad.&quot;</p>\n<p>Dunleavy testified to Congress inmates also are radicalized by other belief systems; but for Muslims, the difference is foreign backing and financing.</p>\n<p>&quot;While investigating radical Islamic influences in prison, we found several indicators that contributed to the radicalization process. One was foreign born inmates who had already committed terrorist acts. Improperly vetted clergy also play a role, along with foreign funds that came to organizations like the North American Islamic Trust Fund, the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), the Islamic Development Bank in Saudi Arabia and the Graduate School of Islamic Social Sciences (GSISS),&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>Some of those funds are used for literature in prison libraries that promote radical Islam.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., the federal Bureau of Prisons hired Egyptian Muslim Fouad El Bayly as a prison chaplain even though he had called for the execution of for Muslim Ayaan Hirsi Ali,a renowned critic of Islam's subjugation of women.</p>\n<p>Bayly said Ali &quot;defamed the faith,&quot; and the &quot;sentence is death.&quot;</p>\n<p>Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, then asked for the names of groups working with the Bureau of Prisons for background checks. Among them were Islamic Society of North America, which was founded by the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>\n<p>Other Muslims came to ISNA's defense, claiming it is &quot;well-respected,&quot; the report said.</p>\n<p>But Dunleavy, a senior fellow at IPT and former deputy inspector general for the New York State Department of Corrections, explained groups like ISNA promote Islamic supremacism, meaning they are working toward the replacement of the U.S. Constitution with Islamic law.</p>\n<p>Zuhdi Jasser of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy said such groups are political and not merely religious.</p>\n<p>Dunleavy wrote: &quot;Organizations with this type of ideology should not be relied upon to certify potential prison chaplains. It only risks promoting radicalization among the inmates and destabilizing the already fragile prison environment.&quot;</p>",

The wrong one can be like a wolf in sheep's clothing filling the inmate's mind with a radical ideology that pushes him or her down the road to jihad.\"\nDunleavy testified to Congress inmates also are radicalized by other belief systems; but for Muslims, the difference is foreign backing and financing.\n\"While investigating radical Islamic influences in prison, we found several indicators that contributed to the radicalization process. One was foreign born inmates who had already committed terrorist acts. Improperly vetted clergy also play a role, along with foreign funds that came to organizations like the North American Islamic Trust Fund, the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), the Islamic Development Bank in Saudi Arabia and the Graduate School of Islamic Social Sciences (GSISS),\" he said.\nSome of those funds are used for literature in prison libraries that promote radical Islam.\nIn the U.S., the federal Bureau of Prisons hired Egyptian Muslim Fouad El Bayly as a prison chaplain even though he had called for the execution of for Muslim Ayaan Hirsi Ali,a renowned critic of Islam's subjugation of women.\nBayly said Ali \"defamed the faith,\" and the \"sentence is death.\"\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, then asked for the names of groups working with the Bureau of Prisons for background checks. Among them were Islamic Society of North America, which was founded by the Muslim Brotherhood.\nOther Muslims came to ISNA's defense, claiming it is \"well-respected,\" the report said.\nBut Dunleavy, a senior fellow at IPT and former deputy inspector general for the New York State Department of Corrections, explained groups like ISNA promote Islamic supremacism, meaning they are working toward the replacement of the U.S. Constitution with Islamic law.\nZuhdi Jasser of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy said such groups are political and not merely religious.\nDunleavy wrote: \"Organizations with this type of ideology should not be relied upon to certify potential prison chaplains. It only risks promoting radicalization among the inmates and destabilizing the already fragile prison environment.\"",

She wrote it and produced it. So we came up with some options,\" Villa told the Hollywood Reporter.\nTRENDING: When NBC reporter refuses to be quiet, GOP impeachment hero Elise Stefanik steps in and crushes her\n\"She went on to make an offhand remark and said, 'or we could always do 'F--- Planned Parenthood,'\" Villa added. \"It's controversial enough to get people's attention and it also is the underlying message of the film.\"\n#UnplannedMovie LA premiere in my custom @Desidesigns dress! @UnplannedMovie pic.twitter.com/xyIRBcWwNG\n\u2014 Joy Villa (@Joy_Villa) March 19, 2019\nVilla's gown was custom-made by Desi Lee Allinger-Nelson of Orange County-based Desi Designs Couture, the Reporter said.\nThe actress said \"abortion is not health care and Planned Parenthood has been pushing that and indoctrinating girls with pink and girliness.\"\n\"So that's why my dress is hot pink and very girly.\"\nThe Hollywood Reporter noted that leaders in the Christian community and in Hollywood have criticized the MPAA ratings board for giving the film an R rating.\nThe film has no profanity or violence, but the MPAA rated it R for \"objectionable\" scenes involving abortion.\nVilla told Newsweek she knew she would get \"a lot of flack\" for the dress.\n\"I'm not really scared anymore,\" Villa said. \"I've been tagging Planned Parenthood in posts exposing their murder ways and what they're doing, being very vocal. But it does make me a target.\"\nShe said she needs a security detail when she goes out.\n\"I always have people around me. But the freedom experience of being able to be truly me and a beacon of hope for so many who can\u2019t speak up is worth it,\" she said.\n\"This is who I am and this is also what I'm known for. People are looking to me to be that person,\" Villa added. \"I'm a minority in this scene. When I go to the Grammys or any red carpet event (even a conservative one), I'm still a minority because there's not many Afro-Latinas who are pro-Trump, outspoken artists actually working [and] living in Hollywood who are going to wear something outlandish, sexy [and] something beautiful with a message.\"",

It is not tolerable. You must not even breathe the possibility of arson because if it's arson then fingers will point in one direction, and we're not gonna point in that direction. We're not gonna permit fingers to point. We're not gonna even allow thoughts in that direction,&quot; he said Tuesday.</p>\n<p>&quot;But let's play the game just to start for just a second here. Even if the Notre Dame fire was not arson, there is no denying that attacks on churches, churches throughout France, throughout Europe, are on the upswing. I'm gonna tell you something, folks. This is just me. But watching those pictures yesterday as that cathedral was burning throughout the afternoon into the evening, watching all that I thought I was looking at what may well be a symbolism for all of Europe going up in flames.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is simply head-in-the-sand denial, to refuse to openly accept what is happening throughout France and throughout Europe. And the very idea that there is this concerted effort coupled with a demand to ignore all of this in my nature is all I need to believe that maybe there&rsquo;s some things going on that everybody knows and some just will not admit and will not permit discussion of. Because there is no denying that attacks on churches in France and all over Europe are on the upswing. It's undeniable. It's not all arson. Not random arson. And everybody knows this.</p>\n<p>&quot;So it makes all this sanctimonious concern about Notre Dame from the people on Drive-By Media cable news channels, kind of rings a little hollow to me since these same news outlets can't be bothered to even report on the attacks on churches, the attacks on Christianity that have been taking place throughout Europe and Africa, not to mention the War on Christianity in the United States, which they are helping to wage. These are undeniable things that are happening,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>Limbaugh pointed to Cavuto's shutdown of Donohue.</p>\n<p>&quot;The moment he got even halfway out with that sentence, the anchors at Fox, 'No, no, no, no, no, we're not going there. We're not going there Bill. We're not gonna speculate, we're not. Until we have the facts, we're not even gonna go there,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>Limbaugh observed that's even though &quot;a report from France&rsquo;s own central criminal intelligence service noted that from 2016 to 2018 there have been thousands of cases of church vandalism, thousands of cases of church &ndash; not synagogue, not mosque &ndash; church vandalism. Thousands of cases from 2016 to 2018, two years. It peaked in 2017, 1,045 cases of church vandalism in France.&quot;</p>\n<p>Twitter users reacted.</p>\n<p>Steve Hosed wrote, &quot;Donahue did not say this was terrorism but was correctly pointing out there has been a definite trend to church burning.&quot;</p>\n<p>Another said, &quot;He was stating facts about what already happened to the churches in France. Let him talk.&quot;</p>\n<p>In 2018, the Ministry of the Interior recorded 541 anti-Semitic acts, 100 anti-Muslim acts and 1063 anti-Christian acts.</p>\n<p>Fox News recently has been accused of censoring criticism of Muslims.</p>\n<p>&quot;Justice with Judge Jeanine&quot; host Jeanine Pirro was suspended after she suggested the hijab worn by Muslim Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was &quot;indicative of her adherence to Shariah law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution.&quot;</p>\n<p>Fox News said her views on the subject &quot;do not reflect those of the network.&quot;</p>",

And the very idea that there is this concerted effort coupled with a demand to ignore all of this in my nature is all I need to believe that maybe there\u2019s some things going on that everybody knows and some just will not admit and will not permit discussion of. Because there is no denying that attacks on churches in France and all over Europe are on the upswing. It's undeniable. It's not all arson. Not random arson. And everybody knows this.\n\"So it makes all this sanctimonious concern about Notre Dame from the people on Drive-By Media cable news channels, kind of rings a little hollow to me since these same news outlets can't be bothered to even report on the attacks on churches, the attacks on Christianity that have been taking place throughout Europe and Africa, not to mention the War on Christianity in the United States, which they are helping to wage. These are undeniable things that are happening,\" he said.\nLimbaugh pointed to Cavuto's shutdown of Donohue.\n\"The moment he got even halfway out with that sentence, the anchors at Fox, 'No, no, no, no, no, we're not going there. We're not going there Bill. We're not gonna speculate, we're not. Until we have the facts, we're not even gonna go there,\" he said.\nLimbaugh observed that's even though \"a report from France\u2019s own central criminal intelligence service noted that from 2016 to 2018 there have been thousands of cases of church vandalism, thousands of cases of church \u2013 not synagogue, not mosque \u2013 church vandalism. Thousands of cases from 2016 to 2018, two years. It peaked in 2017, 1,045 cases of church vandalism in France.\"\nTwitter users reacted.\nSteve Hosed wrote, \"Donahue did not say this was terrorism but was correctly pointing out there has been a definite trend to church burning.\"\nAnother said, \"He was stating facts about what already happened to the churches in France. Let him talk.\"\nIn 2018, the Ministry of the Interior recorded 541 anti-Semitic acts, 100 anti-Muslim acts and 1063 anti-Christian acts.\nFox News recently has been accused of censoring criticism of Muslims.\n\"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" host Jeanine Pirro was suspended after she suggested the hijab worn by Muslim Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was \"indicative of her adherence to Shariah law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution.\"\nFox News said her views on the subject \"do not reflect those of the network.\"",
