That argument depended on Mueller being viewed as what is known as a &ldquo;principal officer&rdquo; who must be confirmed by the Senate.</p>\n<p>The appeals court agreed with the Justice Department that Mueller is an &ldquo;inferior officer,&rdquo; a lower-level official who is under the direction of Rosenstein like other government lawyers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Special Counsel Mueller effectively serves at the pleasure of an Executive Branch officer who was appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate,&rdquo; the three-judge panel concluded. &ldquo;Miller&rsquo;s contention that Special Counsel Mueller is a principal officer under the Appointments Clause thus fails.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Paul Kamenar, Miller&rsquo;s attorney, said he is disappointed in the decision and is still weighing whether to appeal it, either to the full appellate court or to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The fact that the court took over three months to decide this appeal after oral argument &hellip; demonstrates that this was a serious and substantial challenge,&rdquo; Kamenar said.</p>\n<h3>STONE FACES CHARGES</h3>\n<figure><figcaption>FILE PHOTO: Longtime Trump ally Roger Stone gives an interview to Reuters in Washington, U.S., January 31, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Stone, a self-proclaimed &ldquo;dirty trickster&rdquo; and Republican political operative for decades, pleaded not guilty on Jan. 29 to lying to Congress, obstructing an official proceeding and witness tampering, charges brought by Mueller&rsquo;s team.</p>\n<p>Mueller is preparing to submit to Attorney General William Barr a report on his investigation, a probe that has cast a cloud over Trump&rsquo;s presidency.</p>\n<p>Trump has called the Mueller probe a witch hunt. He and Russia have denied collusion. Russia has denied election interference.</p>\n<p>A federal judge previously rejected Manafort&rsquo;s bid to get an indictment against him dismissed by arguing that Mueller&rsquo;s appointment ran afoul of Justice Department rules on installing special counsels.</p>\n<p>Manafort is due to be sentenced next month in two related cases for crimes ranging from bank and tax fraud, to conspiring against the United States and witness tampering.</p>\n<p>A judge separately rejected Russian company Concord Management and Consulting LLC&rsquo;s effort to win dismissal of an indictment secured by Mueller that alleges it helped fund a propaganda operation to sway voters in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Concord, like Miller, argued that Mueller&rsquo;s appointment violated the Constitution, but the judge ruled Mueller&rsquo;s appointment was lawful.</p>\n<p>Miller&rsquo;s legal challenge is the only one that made it to the appellate court. Concord&rsquo;s attorneys filed a brief and participated in oral arguments in support of Miller&rsquo;s claim.</p>\n<p><em>(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley and Sarah N.

                "text": "A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday rejected a challenge brought by an associate of Roger Stone, the indicted long-time advisor to President Donald Trump, to the legality of Robert Mueller\u2019s 2017 appointment by the Justice Department as special counsel heading the Russia investigation.\nIn doing so, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld a lower court\u2019s decision to hold Andrew Miller in contempt for refusing to comply with a grand jury subpoena served on him by Mueller, who is investigating potential conspiracy between Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and Moscow.\nMiller\u2019s case marked the third legal challenge to Mueller\u2019s authority that has failed so far, including efforts by Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman who has been convicted on a series of charges and pleaded guilty to others, and a Russian company accused of meddling in the election.\nMiller is a one-time aide to Stone who has worked for other political campaigns in the past.\nIn Miller\u2019s challenge, the court concluded that Mueller\u2019s appointment by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Department\u2019s No. 2 official, was lawful under the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution that lays out presidential powers on appointing certain public officials.\nMiller\u2019s lawyer had argued that the appointment was unlawful because Mueller was not named by the president and approved by the Senate. That argument depended on Mueller being viewed as what is known as a \u201cprincipal officer\u201d who must be confirmed by the Senate.\nThe appeals court agreed with the Justice Department that Mueller is an \u201cinferior officer,\u201d a lower-level official who is under the direction of Rosenstein like other government lawyers.\n\u201cSpecial Counsel Mueller effectively serves at the pleasure of an Executive Branch officer who was appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate,\u201d the three-judge panel concluded. \u201cMiller\u2019s contention that Special Counsel Mueller is a principal officer under the Appointments Clause thus fails.\u201d\nPaul Kamenar, Miller\u2019s attorney, said he is disappointed in the decision and is still weighing whether to appeal it, either to the full appellate court or to the Supreme Court.\n\u201cThe fact that the court took over three months to decide this appeal after oral argument \u2026 demonstrates that this was a serious and substantial challenge,\u201d Kamenar said.\nSTONE FACES CHARGES\nStone, a self-proclaimed \u201cdirty trickster\u201d and Republican political operative for decades, pleaded not guilty on Jan. 29 to lying to Congress, obstructing an official proceeding and witness tampering, charges brought by Mueller\u2019s team.\nMueller is preparing to submit to Attorney General William Barr a report on his investigation, a probe that has cast a cloud over Trump\u2019s presidency.\nTrump has called the Mueller probe a witch hunt. He and Russia have denied collusion. Russia has denied election interference.\nA federal judge previously rejected Manafort\u2019s bid to get an indictment against him dismissed by arguing that Mueller\u2019s appointment ran afoul of Justice Department rules on installing special counsels.\nManafort is due to be sentenced next month in two related cases for crimes ranging from bank and tax fraud, to conspiring against the United States and witness tampering.\nA judge separately rejected Russian company Concord Management and Consulting LLC\u2019s effort to win dismissal of an indictment secured by Mueller that alleges it helped fund a propaganda operation to sway voters in the 2016 election.\nConcord, like Miller, argued that Mueller\u2019s appointment violated the Constitution, but the judge ruled Mueller\u2019s appointment was lawful.\nMiller\u2019s legal challenge is the only one that made it to the appellate court. Concord\u2019s attorneys filed a brief and participated in oral arguments in support of Miller\u2019s claim.\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley and Sarah N.

The congressman hopped on Twitter and claimed that the article was calling for violence against anti-gun legislators.

                "text": "Congressman Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) called out Congressman Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) after he claimed that the National Rifle Association (NRA) called for violence against Democratic lawmakers.\nSwalwell saw an article in an NRA magazine titled \u201cTarget Practice\u201d that outlined some of the concerns gun owners may have with proposed legislation that could greatly reduce the ability of gun transfers. The congressman hopped on Twitter and claimed that the article was calling for violence against anti-gun legislators. He even went as far as to say they should face legal repercussions for the article.\nThis is a call for violence by the @NRA against @GabbyGiffords, who was nearly killed by gunfire and @SpeakerPelosi, the most powerful legislator in America. The NRA should face legal consequences. But let\u2019s put them out of business with boycotts and ballot boxes. #EnoughIsEnough pic.twitter.com/XFTAg5XJWI\n\u2014 Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) February 23, 2019\nThis allegation against the NRA didn\u2019t sit well for Crenshaw. He took to Twitter to call Swalwell out for \u201cdeliberately lying\u201d about violence where it doesn\u2019t exist.\nHow can you claim this? Are you deliberately lying or did you just not read it?\nThe article is about legislation targeting gun owners, not the NRA targeting Democrats.\nIf your goal is to ensure that \u201coutrage culture\u201d is alive and well, continuing to divide us, congrats. https://t.co/KsnSdPWPb6\n\u2014 Dan Crenshaw (@DanCrenshawTX) February 24, 2019\nHe congratulated Swalwell for further creating division between groups of Americans by assuming the worst of those in the NRA.\nCrenshaw was not alone in his criticism of Swalwell\u2019s tweet. Several others found the tweet to be misleading, if not downright insulting because of Swalwell\u2019s connection to former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Many felt he was exploiting her horrific shooting to degrade his political opponents.\nOthers just mocked Swalwell for an older tweet in which he alluded to the fact that the government could nuke the American people if they had an uprising with guns, as IJR previously reported.\nYou\u2019re despicable. There has been no call for violence by the @NRA against @GabbyGiffords. Gun owners as represented by the NRA save lives every day in this country. Stop lying, stop with the histrionics, stop with attacks against the constitutional right of gun ownership.\n\u2014 DC McAllister (@McAllisterDen) February 23, 2019\nThis literally says nothing about calling for violence.\nIn fact, it\u2019s talking about the targeting of law abiding citizens by Democrats.\nRemember when you said you would nuke gun owners if they didn\u2019t give up their guns? Should you face legal percussions?\n\u2014 Angelo Ray Gomez (@AngeloRayGomez) February 23, 2019\nThis is the congressman that told the general public that he would gladly nuke us if we didn\u2019t give up our guns\u2026\n\u2014 Antonia Okafor (@antonia_okafor) February 24, 2019\nThis creep is exactly why you must buy guns and ammunition\u2026when not threatening to murder millions of Americans for disobeying liberals, he wants dissenters to \"face legal consequences\" for speaking out against liberals.\nHe's exactly why we have, and need, the #2A. https://t.co/DGo5eTEi1U\n\u2014 Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) February 23, 2019\nThe policy that the original NRA article was focused on is H.R. 8, a House bill that expands universal background checks. The bill has some bipartisan support, with a handful of Republicans joining Swalwell as a cosponsor to the legislation.\nAlthough there are some Republican supporters of the legislation, many are concerned, as the NRA was, that the limit on weapon transfers would make gun ownership difficult.\nAccording to an analysis of the bill by Reason, H.R. 8 would require each exchange of a weapon be processed by a gun store. That means even loaning a gun to a friend to go hunting would be illegal unless a gun store processed the exchange.\nWhile the bill may make it through the House, it is unlikely it will find as much support in the Republican-controlled Senate.\nNext post",

It also calls on the Justice Department to release unclassified portions of the document to the public.</p>\n<p>It was not clear how the legislation might fare in the Senate.</p>\n<p>Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell avoided commenting on the Senate bill last month but told reporters that the Mueller report &ldquo;ought to be as fully open and transparent &hellip; as possible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>(Reporting by David Morgan; </em>editing<em> by Franklin Paul and Jonathan Oatis)</em></p>",

It also calls on the Justice Department to release unclassified portions of the document to the public.\nIt was not clear how the legislation might fare in the Senate.\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell avoided commenting on the Senate bill last month but told reporters that the Mueller report \u201cought to be as fully open and transparent \u2026 as possible.\u201d\n(Reporting by David Morgan; editing by Franklin Paul and Jonathan Oatis)",

On Feb. 12, the judge ordered Mejia deported back to Honduras.</p>\n<p>The number of people amassed in immigration detention under the Trump administration has reached record highs, raising concerns among migrant advocates about disease outbreaks and resulting quarantines that limit access to legal services.</p>\n<p>As of March 6, more than 50,000 migrants were in detention, according to ICE data.</p>\n<p>Internal emails reviewed by Reuters reveal the complications of managing outbreaks like the one at Pine Prairie, since immigrant detainees often are transferred around the country and infected people do not necessarily show symptoms of viral diseases even when they are contagious.</p>\n<p>Mumps can easily spread through droplets of saliva in the air, especially in close quarters.

ICE detainees come from countries all over the world, with varying degrees of vaccination coverage.</p>\n<h3>&lsquo;HIGH-PROFILE REMOVAL&rsquo;</h3>\n<p>At Pine Prairie, staff members were at times at odds with the warden about how to manage the mumps outbreak, internal emails show. The warden decided not to quarantine 40 new arrivals from Tallahatchie in February despite concerns raised by the medical staff, one email showed.</p>\n<p>The warden, Indalecio Ramos, who referred questions about the outbreak to ICE and the GEO Group, argued that quarantining the transfers would keep them from attending their court hearings, the facility&rsquo;s health service administrator wrote in a Feb. 7 email.</p>\n<p>In a Feb. 21 email, ICE requested that medical staff members at Pine Prairie clear a detainee quarantined for chicken pox and mumps for travel, calling him a &ldquo;high-profile removal scheduled for deport.&rdquo; In an email to staff later that day, warden Ramos wrote that medical staff had wanted to exclude the detainee from transfer but &ldquo;ICE wants him to travel out of the country anyway &hellip; Please ensure he leaves.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>ICE spokesman Raedy said that travel is restricted for people who are known to be contagious but those exposed to diseases who are asymptomatic can travel.</p>\n<p>Since January, the 1,094-bed Pine Prairie facility has had 18 detainees with confirmed or probable cases of mumps compared to no cases in 2018, according to ICE. As of mid-February, 288 people were under quarantine at Pine Prairie. Mejia said his quarantine ended on Feb. 25.</p>\n<p>Detention centers in other states also have seen a rise in outbreaks.</p>\n<p>There have been 186 mumps cases in immigration detention facilities in Texas since October, the largest outbreak in centers there in recent years, said Lara Anton, the press officer for the Texas Department of State Health Services.</p>\n<p>In Colorado, at the Aurora Contract Detention Facility near Denver, run by the GEO Group, 357 people have been quarantined following eight confirmed and five suspected cases of mumps detected since February, as well as six cases of chicken pox diagnosed since the beginning of January, said Dr. Bernadette Albanese from the Tri County Health Department in Colorado.</p>\n<p>Civil rights attorney Danielle Jefferis said court hearings for quarantined immigrants at Aurora were largely canceled.</p>\n<p>At Pine Prairie on Feb. 12, Mejia said he felt confused and hopeless during his video hearing, with no attorney by his side.</p>\n<p>After Mejia&rsquo;s lawyers complained, attorneys were allowed to visit quarantined detainees on Feb. 13 &ndash; one day too late for Mejia.</p>\n<p>While he is appealing his case, his lawyers say he could be deported at any time.</p>\n<p><em>(Reporting by Mica Rosenberg in New York and Kristina Cooke in San Francisco; Editing by Julie Marquis, Paul Thomasch and Lisa Shumaker)</em></p>\n<p> <a data-bimber-analytics-href=\"https://ijr.com/mueller-navigates-currents-trump-russia/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\" href=\"https://ijr.com/mueller-navigates-currents-trump-russia/\">Next post</a></p>",

Lawmakers did not mention the Pine Prairie outbreak.\nPablo Paez, a spokesman for the GEO Group, the private prison operator that runs Pine Prairie under government contract, said its medical professionals follow standards set by ICE and health authorities. He said medical care provided to detainees allows the company \u201cto detect, treat and follow appropriate medical protocols to manage an infectious outbreak.\u201d\n\u2018UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS\u2019\nThe first cases at Pine Prairie were detected in January in four migrants who had been recently transferred from the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Mississippi, according to internal emails.\nTallahatchie, run by private detention company CoreCivic Inc, has had five confirmed cases of mumps and 18 cases of chicken pox since January, according to company spokeswoman Amanda Gilchrist. She said no one who was diagnosed was transferred out of the facility while the disease was active.\nTallahatchie houses hundreds of migrants recently apprehended along the U.S.- Mexico border, ICE said.\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told reporters that changing demographics on the southwest border, with more immigrants from Central America traveling long distances, overwhelmed border officials and raised health concerns.\n\u201cWe are seeing migrants arrive with illnesses and medical conditions in unprecedented numbers,\u201d McAleenan said at a press conference.\nHowever, vaccination rates in the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras are above 90 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ICE detainees come from countries all over the world, with varying degrees of vaccination coverage.\n\u2018HIGH-PROFILE REMOVAL\u2019\nAt Pine Prairie, staff members were at times at odds with the warden about how to manage the mumps outbreak, internal emails show.

As of mid-February, 288 people were under quarantine at Pine Prairie. Mejia said his quarantine ended on Feb. 25.\nDetention centers in other states also have seen a rise in outbreaks.\nThere have been 186 mumps cases in immigration detention facilities in Texas since October, the largest outbreak in centers there in recent years, said Lara Anton, the press officer for the Texas Department of State Health Services.\nIn Colorado, at the Aurora Contract Detention Facility near Denver, run by the GEO Group, 357 people have been quarantined following eight confirmed and five suspected cases of mumps detected since February, as well as six cases of chicken pox diagnosed since the beginning of January, said Dr. Bernadette Albanese from the Tri County Health Department in Colorado.\nCivil rights attorney Danielle Jefferis said court hearings for quarantined immigrants at Aurora were largely canceled.\nAt Pine Prairie on Feb. 12, Mejia said he felt confused and hopeless during his video hearing, with no attorney by his side.\nAfter Mejia\u2019s lawyers complained, attorneys were allowed to visit quarantined detainees on Feb. 13 \u2013 one day too late for Mejia.\nWhile he is appealing his case, his lawyers say he could be deported at any time.\n(Reporting by Mica Rosenberg in New York and Kristina Cooke in San Francisco; Editing by Julie Marquis, Paul Thomasch and Lisa Shumaker)\nNext post",

It also put together the video that Sanders used to launch his 2020 campaign, and advised Sanders on his announcement schedule and rollout, Longabaugh said.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Devine also served as a top political strategist and frequent spokesman for Sanders, while Longabaugh was a senior adviser and Mulvey was creative director for the ad campaigns. Many of the firm&rsquo;s 2016 ads drew wide notice and critical acclaim during the campaign.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are grateful for the opportunity to have worked for Senator Sanders in his historic 2016 campaign for president,&rdquo; the strategists said in their statement.</p>\n<p>According to Federal Election Commission records, the Sanders campaign paid the firm about $5.3 million during the 2016 cycle for its services.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The campaign appreciates all the good work DML has done and wishes them well,&rdquo; Sanders&rsquo; new campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement, using an acronym for the firm run by the three.</p>\n<p>As he launches his second run, Sanders has been under pressure to bring in a more diverse set of advisers than the largely white inner circle that ran his 2016 bid.</p>\n<p>Sanders has already proven to be a fundraising juggernaut in the first week of his presidential run. His campaign said on Tuesday he had raised about $10 million from nearly 360,000 donors in the first week.</p>\n<p>He will make his first campaign trail appearances this weekend with rallies in Brooklyn, where he was born and raised, and Chicago.</p>\n<p>The split comes after Devine drew attention last year for his connections to former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort. Devine worked with Manafort to help elect pro-Russian Victor Yanukovich president of Ukraine in 2010.</p>\n<p>Manafort has been convicted of multiple felony counts by Special Counsel Robert Mueller related to his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Devine testified at Manafort&rsquo;s trial, but was not accused of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>Russia has denied meddling in the election. Republican President Donald Trump has called Mueller&rsquo;s investigation a witch hunt.</p>\n<p><em>(Reporting by John Whitesides; editing by Jonathan Oatis)</em></p>",

Many of the firm\u2019s 2016 ads drew wide notice and critical acclaim during the campaign.\n\u201cWe are grateful for the opportunity to have worked for Senator Sanders in his historic 2016 campaign for president,\u201d the strategists said in their statement.\nAccording to Federal Election Commission records, the Sanders campaign paid the firm about $5.3 million during the 2016 cycle for its services.\n\u201cThe campaign appreciates all the good work DML has done and wishes them well,\u201d Sanders\u2019 new campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement, using an acronym for the firm run by the three.\nAs he launches his second run, Sanders has been under pressure to bring in a more diverse set of advisers than the largely white inner circle that ran his 2016 bid.\nSanders has already proven to be a fundraising juggernaut in the first week of his presidential run. His campaign said on Tuesday he had raised about $10 million from nearly 360,000 donors in the first week.\nHe will make his first campaign trail appearances this weekend with rallies in Brooklyn, where he was born and raised, and Chicago.\nThe split comes after Devine drew attention last year for his connections to former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort. Devine worked with Manafort to help elect pro-Russian Victor Yanukovich president of Ukraine in 2010.\nManafort has been convicted of multiple felony counts by Special Counsel Robert Mueller related to his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Devine testified at Manafort\u2019s trial, but was not accused of wrongdoing.\nRussia has denied meddling in the election. Republican President Donald Trump has called Mueller\u2019s investigation a witch hunt.\n(Reporting by John Whitesides; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

As long as there\u2019s no testing, we\u2019re happy.\u201d\nNorth Korea conducted its last nuclear test in September 2017 and its last intercontinental ballistic missile test in November 2017.\nAnalysts say the two leaders have to move beyond summit symbolism.\n\u201cThe most basic yet urgent task is to come to a shared understanding of what denuclearization would entail,\u201d said Gi-Wook Shin, director of Stanford\u2019s Asia-Pacific Research Center.\n\u201cThe ambiguity and obscurity of the term \u2018denuclearization\u2019 only exacerbates the scepticism about both the U.S. and North Korean commitments to denuclearization.\u201d\nWhile the United States is demanding North Korea give up all of its nuclear and missile programs, North Korea wants to see the removal of the U.S. nuclear umbrella for South Korea.\nA South Korean presidential spokesman told reporters in Seoul the two sides might be able to agree to a formal end of the Korean War, which was concluded with an armistice not a peace treaty, a move North Korea has long sought.\nProtesters in Seoul tore up photographs of Kim and threw them to the ground to highlight their dismay that North Korea\u2019s grim human rights record was not expected to figure in talks.\nAmnesty International said Trump had disregarded human rights to gain favor with Kim.\n\u201cHis silence in the face of relentless and grave human rights violations has been deafening,\u201d it said.\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason and Khanh Vu; Additional reporting by David Brunnstrom in WASHINGTON, Mai Nguyen, Hyonhee Shin and Josh Smith in HANOI, Joyce Lee in SEOUL; Writing by Robert Birsel; Editing by Lincoln Feast)",

If successful, the bipartisan effort would boost short-term bank profits but render the financial system vulnerable to another crash.</p>\n<p>At issue is the supplementary leverage rule, which was adopted in the aftermath of the 2008 collapse as a last line of defense against financial excess. While most banking rules involve a dizzying array of technical definitions, exceptions and complications to account for different risks, the leverage rule was designed to be a simple, blunt instrument.</p>\n<p>At the most basic operational level, banks get into trouble when they rely too heavily on borrowed money to &ldquo;leverage&rdquo; their own capital. The more borrowed money banks use, the bigger their profits during a boom and the larger their losses in an unforeseen downturn.

Two of the four regulators, Rostin Behnam and Dan Berkovitz, were handpicked by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to fill the agency&rsquo;s dedicated slots for Democrats. The fifth commissioner, Dawn Stump, recused herself from commenting on the rule.</p>\n<p>In the years since the banking crash, even Republicans have been reluctant to openly call for looser regulations on the largest banks. Wall Street&rsquo;s advocates in Washington typically point to the assistance that deregulation will provide to small banks, or blame federal regulators for problems instead of the banks they oversee.</p>\n<p>But that posture may be changing. Trump <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"3\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"subsec:paragraph;cpos:6;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/steve-mnuchin-bond-villain\">Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin</a> <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"4\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"subsec:paragraph;cpos:6;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/news/Pages/Summary-of-Recommendations-for-Regulatory-Reform.aspx\">endorsed</a> a plan to lower leverage requirements for big banks in 2017. At a congressional hearing last week, Reps. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) and Roger Williams (R-Texas) <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"5\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"subsec:paragraph;cpos:6;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/wells-fargo-ceo-timothy-sloan-congress_n_5c87fa84e4b0450ddae4e655\">defended</a> the scandal-plagued banking behemoth Wells Fargo, deriding its critics as advocates of &ldquo;socialist banking&rdquo; and &ldquo;socialism.&rdquo; Last month, five Republican Senators led by Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) wrote to the Government Accountability Office, seeking to build a case for <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"6\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"subsec:paragraph;cpos:6;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tillis.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/7eb2d951-0ae1-4728-8d6b-e27683470fff/fed-liscc-gao-request-2-22-19.pdf\">repealing regulatory guidance</a> on the largest banks through the Congressional Review Act.</p>\n<p>And at least some Democrats appear to be joining the deregulation push. Derivatives typically function as a sort of bet on economic activity \u2015 a gamble that the price of a financial asset will move up or down. When banks trade derivatives for hedge funds or other investors, they are required to charge a small up-front fee called &ldquo;margin,&rdquo; which the bank can use to help cushion any losses should their clients be unable to pay up. Berkovitz, Behnam and Republican Commissioners Christopher Giancarlo and Brian Quintenz argue that this margin should be <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"7\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"subsec:paragraph;cpos:7;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/SA-CCRCommentLetter021519.pdf\">excluded</a> from leverage calculations, increasing the amount of borrowed money banks can put into play under existing leverage requirements.</p>\n<p>Including margin, the bipartisan team of regulators argued, discourages banks from trading derivatives through central clearinghouses, which is a safer and more transparent way to trade. Central clearinghouses guarantee the ability of each bank to make good on their bets, helping prevent a default from a bank from cascading through the financial system. The CFTC Commissioners argued that the current rule is &ldquo;working counterproductively&rdquo; and producing &ldquo;an inflated measure&rdquo; of a bank&rsquo;s overall &ldquo;exposure&rdquo; to trouble.</p>\n<p>Lobbyists for big banks have been making this argument for years, but <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"13\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"subsec:paragraph;cpos:9;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.occ.gov/topics/capital-markets/financial-markets/derivatives/pub-derivatives-quarterly-qtr3-2018.pdf\">data</a> from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency tells a different story. In recent years, banks have increased the proportion of derivatives they send through a central clearinghouse.</p>\n<p>Financial reform advocates, meanwhile, note that other CFTC rules flatly require risky types of derivatives to go through a clearinghouse, while separate requirements on bank capital can be tailored to encourage or discourage particular types of trading.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The idea that lowering their leverage requirements will make the system safer \u2015 that&rsquo;s a really incredible thing for federal regulators to say,&rdquo; said Gregg Gelzinis, a policy analyst at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank. &ldquo;Carving up the leverage ratio and lowering the equity buffers at Wall Street banks will only increase the likelihood of another crash.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the Securities and Exchange Commission have final say over leverage requirements, and are currently in the process of rewriting the rules. Both the Fed and the SEC are stacked with Trump appointees <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"14\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"subsec:paragraph;cpos:12;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-chairman-nominee-jay-clayton-says-past-wall-street-work-is-a-strength-1490281093\">friendly to big banks</a>, but support within the agencies is not uniform. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Randall Quarles approved of reducing leverage requirements last year, while <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"15\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"subsec:paragraph;cpos:12;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-banks/u-s-bank-regulators-propose-easing-capital-curb-on-leverage-idUSKBN1HI363\">Lael Brainard, an Obama appointee, did not</a>. Public support from two Democratic regulators at the CFTC changes the dynamic in Washington, helping insulate the Fed&rsquo;s deregulation advocates from criticism.</p>\n<p>But at least some Democrats in Congress are crying foul. Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) was a bank regulation scholar for years before she ran for Congress last year, and has been a scourge of financial heavyweights from her new post on the House Financial Services Committee. In a statement provided to HuffPost, Porter excoriated the plan to weaken leverage rules as &ldquo;another example of Trump regulators listening to Wall Street&rsquo;s wish list.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Between this, the banking deregulation bill passed last year, and other changes proposed by the Fed and OCC, we can expect Too Big to Fail banks to get riskier and have less of a cushion to guard taxpayers from bailouts,&rdquo; Porter said.</p>",

Two of the four regulators, Rostin Behnam and Dan Berkovitz, were handpicked by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to fill the agency\u2019s dedicated slots for Democrats. The fifth commissioner, Dawn Stump, recused herself from commenting on the rule.\nIn the years since the banking crash, even Republicans have been reluctant to openly call for looser regulations on the largest banks. Wall Street\u2019s advocates in Washington typically point to the assistance that deregulation will provide to small banks, or blame federal regulators for problems instead of the banks they oversee.\nBut that posture may be changing. Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin endorsed a plan to lower leverage requirements for big banks in 2017. At a congressional hearing last week, Reps. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) and Roger Williams (R-Texas) defended the scandal-plagued banking behemoth Wells Fargo, deriding its critics as advocates of \u201csocialist banking\u201d and \u201csocialism.\u201d Last month, five Republican Senators led by Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) wrote to the Government Accountability Office, seeking to build a case for repealing regulatory guidance on the largest banks through the Congressional Review Act.\nAnd at least some Democrats appear to be joining the deregulation push. Derivatives typically function as a sort of bet on economic activity \u2015 a gamble that the price of a financial asset will move up or down. When banks trade derivatives for hedge funds or other investors, they are required to charge a small up-front fee called \u201cmargin,\u201d which the bank can use to help cushion any losses should their clients be unable to pay up. Berkovitz, Behnam and Republican Commissioners Christopher Giancarlo and Brian Quintenz argue that this margin should be excluded from leverage calculations, increasing the amount of borrowed money banks can put into play under existing leverage requirements.\nIncluding margin, the bipartisan team of regulators argued, discourages banks from trading derivatives through central clearinghouses, which is a safer and more transparent way to trade. Central clearinghouses guarantee the ability of each bank to make good on their bets, helping prevent a default from a bank from cascading through the financial system. The CFTC Commissioners argued that the current rule is \u201cworking counterproductively\u201d and producing \u201can inflated measure\u201d of a bank\u2019s overall \u201cexposure\u201d to trouble.\nLobbyists for big banks have been making this argument for years, but data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency tells a different story. In recent years, banks have increased the proportion of derivatives they send through a central clearinghouse.\nFinancial reform advocates, meanwhile, note that other CFTC rules flatly require risky types of derivatives to go through a clearinghouse, while separate requirements on bank capital can be tailored to encourage or discourage particular types of trading.\n\u201cThe idea that lowering their leverage requirements will make the system safer \u2015 that\u2019s a really incredible thing for federal regulators to say,\u201d said Gregg Gelzinis, a policy analyst at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank. \u201cCarving up the leverage ratio and lowering the equity buffers at Wall Street banks will only increase the likelihood of another crash.\u201d\nThe Federal Reserve, the OCC and the Securities and Exchange Commission have final say over leverage requirements, and are currently in the process of rewriting the rules. Both the Fed and the SEC are stacked with Trump appointees friendly to big banks, but support within the agencies is not uniform. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Randall Quarles approved of reducing leverage requirements last year, while Lael Brainard, an Obama appointee, did not. Public support from two Democratic regulators at the CFTC changes the dynamic in Washington, helping insulate the Fed\u2019s deregulation advocates from criticism.\nBut at least some Democrats in Congress are crying foul. Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) was a bank regulation scholar for years before she ran for Congress last year, and has been a scourge of financial heavyweights from her new post on the House Financial Services Committee. In a statement provided to HuffPost, Porter excoriated the plan to weaken leverage rules as \u201canother example of Trump regulators listening to Wall Street\u2019s wish list.\u201d\n\u201cBetween this, the banking deregulation bill passed last year, and other changes proposed by the Fed and OCC, we can expect Too Big to Fail banks to get riskier and have less of a cushion to guard taxpayers from bailouts,\u201d Porter said.",

Advocates who pushed for the amendment strongly oppose such a provision, saying that it conditions one\u2019s ability to vote on how much money they have.\nThe state should only require people to repay fines and fees that were part of their original sentence before restoring their rights, Neil Volz, the political director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, said during a hearing earlier this year.\nThe bill in the House is an \u201caffront\u201d to the voters who approved the constitutional amendment, according to Kirk Bailey, the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, which supported the measure.\n\u201cThis is exactly what we were worried about from the beginning \u2014 legislative attempts to undermine the will of the people who voted for second chances and to rid Florida of the last vestiges of its Jim Crow era past,\u201d Bailey said in a statement. \u201dThis bill will broaden the narrow exclusions for murder and sexual felony offense in the amendment, and broaden what was contemplated by completion of one\u2019s sentence to include all sorts of court fees and supervision costs unrelated to one\u2019s sentence.\u201d\nRequiring repayment of fines and fees could affect up to 540,000 people, according to a 2018 estimate by Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, and Marc Mauer, the executive director of the Sentencing Project.\nDesmond Meade, the executive director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the main group behind the bill, sent an email to supporters on Monday afternoon saying the constitutional amendment was \u201cunder attack.\u201d\nState Rep. James Grant (R), the chairman of Florida\u2019s House Criminal Justice Subcommittee, did not immediately return HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. He told the Orlando Sentinel that the constitutional amendment was unclear.\n\u201cWhen the Constitution says \u2018felony sex offenses\u2019 and that means nothing legally, the best I can do is propose a list of felonies that are sexual,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is I\u2019m going to do my best effort to maintain what I believe the rule of law now requires in a super-ambiguous constitutional amendment.\u201d\nGrant said during testimony Tuesday that advocates indicated requiring payment of fines and fees would be acceptable when they asked the Florida Supreme Court to approve the measure for the ballot.\nThis story has been updated to note that the House subcommittee advanced the bill.",

But, he charged, it would prevent, say, someone from letting their cousin borrow their gun. (The legislation actually includes exemptions on background checks for family members and &ldquo;transfers for hunting, target shooting, and self-defense.&rdquo;)</p>\n<p>Republicans were also successful in getting Democrats to adopt a motion to recommit that would notify the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency when immigrants without legal status attempt to purchase a gun. That motion was adopted 220-209, with 26 Democrats supporting the GOP motion. The language was quickly added and the vote on the underlying bill still proceeded as scheduled.</p>\n<p>While this first piece of gun legislation wouldn&rsquo;t affect a significant number of firearm sales, Democrats looked at this bill as long-awaited action after so many mass shootings and moments of silence.</p>\n<p>As Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said on the floor Wednesday, &ldquo;The moments of silence have not worked.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And while Democrats readily admitted more action would be needed, Democrats lauded the legislation as something that would break the normal pattern in Congress.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is not a moment of silence,&rdquo; Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) said. &ldquo;This is not a sit-in.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That sit-in, which came in response to the Orlando night club shooting in 2016, lasted for 11 hours, with Democrats seizing the floor to try and force action on gun control.</p>\n<p>But there was no action, and gun control fell by the wayside.</p>\n<p>One of the leaders of that sit-in, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), praised the legislation as overdue action. &ldquo;We feel your pain,&rdquo; Lewis said. &ldquo;We heard your cries. And today we are going to answer. Today. Now.&rdquo;</p>",

(The legislation actually includes exemptions on background checks for family members and \u201ctransfers for hunting, target shooting, and self-defense.\u201d)\nRepublicans were also successful in getting Democrats to adopt a motion to recommit that would notify the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency when immigrants without legal status attempt to purchase a gun. That motion was adopted 220-209, with 26 Democrats supporting the GOP motion. The language was quickly added and the vote on the underlying bill still proceeded as scheduled.\nWhile this first piece of gun legislation wouldn\u2019t affect a significant number of firearm sales, Democrats looked at this bill as long-awaited action after so many mass shootings and moments of silence.\nAs Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said on the floor Wednesday, \u201cThe moments of silence have not worked.\u201d\nAnd while Democrats readily admitted more action would be needed, Democrats lauded the legislation as something that would break the normal pattern in Congress.\n\u201cThis is not a moment of silence,\u201d Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) said. \u201cThis is not a sit-in.\u201d\nThat sit-in, which came in response to the Orlando night club shooting in 2016, lasted for 11 hours, with Democrats seizing the floor to try and force action on gun control.\nBut there was no action, and gun control fell by the wayside.\nOne of the leaders of that sit-in, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), praised the legislation as overdue action. \u201cWe feel your pain,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWe heard your cries. And today we are going to answer. Today. Now.\u201d",

And we get no credit for that.\u201d pic.twitter.com/d4deB0lrbB\n\u2014 Lis Power (@LisPower1) March 19, 2019\nPavlich\u2019s argument is factually inaccurate: There are several countries that outlawed slavery before the U.S. did in 1865.\nThat didn\u2019t stop her from arguing that offering reparations to black Americans would actually make race relations even worse.\n\u201cIf you want to inflame racial tension even more, start blaming people who have nothing to do with slavery for the sin of slavery,\u201d she offered. \u201cThat is not fair, that\u2019s not the American way, and we shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\u201d\nPavlich\u2019s comments caught the attention of many, including journalist Soledad O\u2019Brien, who called the Fox News contributor \u201ca complete moron.\u201d\nPavlich went to Twitter to walk back her comments slightly and to whine about O\u2019Brien\u2019s shade.\nShould have said one of* first countries, from the point of founding. My argument stands, but please @soledadobrien please continue name calling as your argument and the smearing of America as the originator of slavery. https://t.co/95dhf2b9aR\n\u2014 Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) March 19, 2019\nO\u2019Brien didn\u2019t back down. Instead, she suggested that, in the future, Pavlich might want to do research before making false historical claims.\nYour argument is factually inaccurate. Google when slavery started and ended if you don\u2019t want to be known for your ignorance. https://t.co/Oe32bN7zjV\n\u2014 Soledad O\u2019Brien (@soledadobrien) March 19, 2019\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the date the U.S. outlawed slavery as 1863.",

Trump was asked to participate in the Ukrainian-American Economic Forum and appeared briefly via video conference.</p>\n<p>Pressley concluded by asking Cohen whether a person could use the term &ldquo;shithole countries,&rdquo; refer to white supremacists as &ldquo;fine people,&rdquo; have a black friend and still be racist. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cohen said.</p>\n<p><strong>4:52 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>Rep.

He said he&rsquo;d asked for a copy of the audit to show reporters as proof but &ldquo;was never able to obtain one.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I presume that he is not under audit,&rdquo; Cohen said.

As noted by the Southern District of New York, Cohen&rsquo;s wide array of crimes were &lsquo;marked by a pattern of deception that permeated his professional life&rsquo; and his &lsquo;instinct to blame others is strong.&rsquo; Prosecutors said his actions were to ensure that he would &lsquo;profit personally, build his own power, and enhance his level of influence.&rsquo; This is the same Michael Cohen who has admitted that he lied to Congress previously.

The alleged trip was outlined in Steele&rsquo;s dossier on Trump. It suggested that Cohen went to the city in the Czech Republic in August 2016 to meet Russian operatives. Cohen has always refuted the claim, but this is his strongest denial yet.</p>\n<p><strong>1:56 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>Rep Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) said Dems were &ldquo;grasping at straws&rdquo; with this hearing. Then she asked what Republicans have been asking all day: whether Cohen planned to pursue a book deal. He said he did.</p>\n<p><strong>1:51 p.m. ET </strong></p>\n<p>When asked about the existence of a video allegedly showing Trump hitting first lady Melania Trump in an elevator, Cohen said: &ldquo;The story goes that he struck Melania in that elevator because there&rsquo;s a camera. &hellip; I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not true. &hellip; I don&rsquo;t think that he struck Mrs. Trump, ever.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He said he doesn&rsquo;t think that tape exists.</p>\n<p><strong>1:47 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>Cohen once again said David Pecker, publisher of the National Enquirer, had paid for and then not published additional stories on behalf of Trump. He specifically mentioned the story of Trump&rsquo;s alleged &ldquo;love child&rdquo; with an employee. Cohen said an elevator operator claimed to have overheard a conversation about the supposed child and that Pecker paid him to keep quiet. Trump got nervous when Pecker entertained thoughts of leaving the Enquirer, according to Cohen.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We were concerned about \u2015 we&rsquo;ll call it the &lsquo;treasure trove&rsquo; of information that would be there if he left,&rdquo; Cohen said, adding that he discussed buying the rights to those stories.</p>\n<p><strong>1:39 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) asked if Trump was telling the truth when he said he had never talked to Roger Stone about the stolen DNC emails.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was a short conversation,&rdquo; Cohen said. &ldquo;[Stone] said, &lsquo;Mr. Trump, I wanted to let you know I just got off the phone with Julian Assange, and in a couple days there&rsquo;s gonna be a massive dump of emails that is going to hurt [Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s] campaign.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>1:31 p.m. ET </strong></p>\n<p>Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) to Cohen: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve arrested several thousand men, and you remind me of many of them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>1:24 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>Cohen told Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) that Trump spoke with him to coordinate a messaging strategy after the Wall Street Journal broke the story about a hush-money payment to Daniels in January 2018. In the days that followed, Cohen admitted he had used his personal funds to pay off Daniels. That was technically true, he told Hill \u2015 he just left out the part about the president planning to repay him. He said he helped craft statements to news organizations in order to protect Trump.</p>\n<p><em><strong>CORRECTION:</strong> Katie Hill was previously referred to as a congresswoman who represents Texas. She represents California. </em></p>\n<p><strong>1:17 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1:13 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>When questioned about how Trump gave orders indirectly, Cohen said, &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t give you orders. He speaks in code, and I understand the code because I&rsquo;ve been around him for a decade.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Then Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) asked: &ldquo;What truth does [Trump] fear most?&rdquo; Cohen paused for several seconds before saying he didn&rsquo;t know how to answer.</p>\n<p><strong>1:11 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1:05 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have no reason to believe that tape exists,&rdquo; Cohen said when asked about the rumored existence of damaging video involving Trump.</p>\n<p>The idea that Russian President Vladimir Putin had compromising information on Trump, including a so-called &ldquo;pee tape&rdquo; depicting him in sexual acts, was put forth in the dossier compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele in 2016. In his memoir, former FBI Director James Comey claimed that Trump was obsessed with disproving the allegation.</p>\n<p><strong>12:57 p.m. ET </strong></p>\n<p>Cohen told the committee that although Trump&rsquo;s 2016 presidential campaign was a moneymaking scheme, it shifted gears after Trump won the election. Only then did the campaign become about &ldquo;what to do here in Washington,&rdquo; Cohen said.</p>\n<p><strong>12:52 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>Rep. Michael Cloud (R-Texas) suggested that being in prison and getting a theoretical &ldquo;million-dollar book deal&rdquo; is &ldquo;not a bad life.&rdquo; He asked Cohen whether he would commit to donating all proceeds from a future book deal.</p>\n<p><strong>12:47 p.m. ET </strong></p>\n<p>Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) wondered whether Trump&rsquo;s regular use of nondisclosure agreements may be silencing others with evidence of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do you believe there are people out there today, from president&rsquo;s business or personal life, who are not coming forward due to the president&rsquo;s use of NDAs against them?&rdquo; he asked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer that question,&rdquo; Cohen said.</p>\n<p><strong>12:46 p.m. ET </strong></p>\n<p>Cohen said he could not discuss what, if anything, Trump or his aides communicated to him in the months after the FBI raided the former attorney&rsquo;s home and offices because it is presently under investigation by the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p><strong>12:42 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>Cohen is shaking his head after Republicans speak. He noted earlier that none of them has asked him yet about Trump, only about his conviction for lying to Congress.</p>\n<p><em>\u2015 Andy Campbell</em></p>\n<p><strong>12:41 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>Cohen told Connolly that he met with Trump and attorney Jay Sekulow in the Oval Office prior to the August 2017 testimony in which he lied to Congress behind closed doors. Trump wanted to ensure Cohen would remain loyal, he said.</p>\n<p><strong>12:35 p.m. ET </strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be fooled&rdquo; by Republicans trying to shift focus of the hearing to Cohen&rsquo;s lying, said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). He said Congress relies regularly on testimony from &ldquo;shady figures who are convicted of a lot worse crimes than you, Mr. Cohen.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The argument Republicans have been using to undermine Cohen would make every one of the government&rsquo;s organized crime convictions &ldquo;null and void,&rdquo; Connolly said.</p>\n<p><em> &mdash; Andy Campbell and Sara Boboltz </em></p>\n<p><strong>12:27 p.m. ET </strong></p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re back from the break, and Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) has accused Cohen of making his allegations for &ldquo;personal benefit&rdquo; and a book deal.</p>\n<p>She asked Cohen if he would commit to not seeking a book deal or one day running for office. He said he would not commit to that.</p>\n<p><strong>12:15 p.m. ET </strong></p>\n<p>Cohen requested a break, which was granted.</p>\n<p><strong>12:14 p.m. ET </strong></p>\n<p>When asked if Trump would directly threaten people who crossed him, Cohen replied, &ldquo;No. He would use others. I&rsquo;m not so sure he had to hire them, they were already working there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sending out the message that this is his country; he&rsquo;s becoming an autocrat,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p><strong>12:13 p.m. ET </strong></p>\n<p>Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) asked Cohen at what point in his life he decided to &ldquo;start telling the truth.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Helsinki, Charlottesville, watching the daily destruction of our civility to one another,&rdquo; Cohen responded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that sort of behavior that I&rsquo;m responsible for. I&rsquo;m responsible for your silliness because I did the same type of thing you&rsquo;re doing now for 10 years.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years and the fact that you pull up a news article that has no value to it and you want to use that as the premise for discrediting me, that I&rsquo;m not the person that people called at three in the morning would make you inaccurate,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;In actuality, it would make you a liar which puts you into the same position that I am in.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cohen issued a warning to others who might follow Trump &ldquo;blindly&rdquo;: &ldquo;They are going to suffer the same consequences that I&rsquo;m suffering.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>12:07 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>Republicans continue to use their time to dunk on Cohen by reiterating that he&rsquo;s a convicted liar.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How could anyone listen to this pathological person?&rdquo; said Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.). &ldquo;This is all about you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He added: &ldquo;Liar, liar, pants on fire.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>11:56 a.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>Donald Trump Jr. jumps on Rep.

The lawmaker claimed Patton would never work for a man who is racist.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Neither should I, as the son of a Holocaust survivor,&rdquo; Cohen said. &ldquo;Ask Ms. Patton how many black people are executives at the Trump Organization. The answer is zero.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>11:48 a.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>Cohen described to Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) how Trump would overvalue his assets in order to game Forbes magazine&rsquo;s list of wealthiest people. According to Cohen, Trump would estimate the value of his buildings with the highest price per square foot of similar buildings in the area, among other duplicitous strategies. Trump inflated his net worth by around $4 billion when he tried to obtain a loan from Deutsche Bank to buy the Buffalo Bills, Cohen said.</p>\n<p>He also reiterated that Trump would use bogus metrics to inflate or deflate the value of his assets, saying the metrics would change depending on whether he was talking to media or insurance companies.</p>\n<p><em>\u2015 Andy Campbell and Sara Boboltz</em></p>\n<p><strong>11:45 a.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>In a heated line of questioning, Rep.

                "text": "Michael Cohen, former personal lawyer to President Donald Trump, is telling his side of the story about working with the president when he testifies before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Wednesday.\nIt\u2019s a moment of high drama on Capitol Hill. Sources close to Cohen told news outlets on Tuesday that Cohen\u2019s testimony paints an unflattering picture of Trump, detailing allegedly racist language and potential criminal conduct while the president is 8,000 miles away in Hanoi, Vietnam.\nCohen released his opening statement hours before he read it for Congress, saying he felt \u201cashamed\u201d of working for Trump and accused the president of having prior knowledge of the Democratic National Committee hack.\nAt Wednesday\u2019s public hearing in front of the House committee led by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Cohen\u2019s replies are limited on order of the special counsel\u2019s office.\nCohen has spent much of the hearing detailing his questionable activities and business practices he says were done at the direction of Trump.\nRepublicans have tried to attack Cohen\u2019s testimony by pointing out that he pleaded guilty for lying to Congress. In response, Cohen said: \u201cI take responsibility. I am remorseful.\u201d\nRead live updates below. (You may need to refresh the page to see the latest updates.):\n5:23 p.m. ET\nCohen appeared to tear up as Cummings said he felt bad for his young children.\nBut \u201cthis is part of your destiny,\u201d Cummings said. He said the hearing and investigations would hopefully lead to \u201ca better Donald Trump, a better United States of America, and a better world.\u201d\n\u2014 Andy Campbell\n5:18 p.m. ET\nIn his closing statement, Cohen issued a warning: \u201cI fear that if he loses the election in 2020, there will never be a peaceful transition of power.\u201d\nThe former attorney then ran through a long list of critiques, shaming the president for everything from attacking the media to separating families at the U.S. border.\n\u201cIn closing, I\u2019d like to say directly to the president: We honor our veterans even in the rain. You tell the truth even when it doesn\u2019t aggrandize you. You respect the law and our incredible law enforcement agents, you don\u2019t villainize them. You don\u2019t disparage generals, Gold Star families, prisoners of war and other heroes who had the courage to fight for this country. You don\u2019t attack the media and those who question what you don\u2019t like or don\u2019t want them to say. You take responsibility for your own dirty deeds. \u2026 You don\u2019t separate families. \u2026 You don\u2019t cuddle up to our adversaries at the expense of our allies. \u2026 This behavior is churlish, it denigrates the office of the president, and it\u2019s not you.\u201d\n5:09 p.m. ET\nRep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) asked Cohen to respond to a HuffPost roundup of tweets from the @WomenForCohen fan account.\n\u2015 Ani Vrabel\n5:03 p.m. ET\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) used part of her time to call out Meadows for drawing attention to Patton and using her as evidence that the president is not racist.\nSaying he has friends \u2015 including Cummings \u2015 and family members who are people of color, Meadows responded: \u201cIt\u2019s racist to suggest I asked her to come in here for that reason.\u201d\nAfter Cummings intervened and referred to Meadows as one of his best friends, Tlaib said she was not specifically calling Meadows a racist.\nMeadows appeared to tear up.\n\u201cI do apologize if that\u2019s what it sounded like,\u201d Talib said.\n4:58 p.m. ET\n\u201cIt was all about ego,\u201d Cohen said when Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) asked why Trump would want to drum up the price of a portrait of himself at auction.\nCohen also cited a contract he drew up between Trump and Ukranian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk as another example of the president using the Trump Foundation for his own personal benefit. Trump was asked to participate in the Ukrainian-American Economic Forum and appeared briefly via video conference.\nPressley concluded by asking Cohen whether a person could use the term \u201cshithole countries,\u201d refer to white supremacists as \u201cfine people,\u201d have a black friend and still be racist. \u201cYes,\u201d Cohen said.\n4:52 p.m. ET\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) fired off several questions about Trump\u2019s tax history. Cohen repeatedly answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether Congress should have access to and investigate the tax returns of Trump and his organization.\nShe further pressed Cohen into implicating Weisselberg in Trump\u2019s allegedly fraudulent inflation and deflation of his assets to avoid paying taxes.\n4:42 p.m. ET\nRep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) dug in with a few questions about Trump\u2019s tax returns, which the president has infamously refused to release to the public. Trump has repeatedly claimed to be under audit and has said his financial advisers strongly recommend he not share his tax information.\nCohen said he didn\u2019t know whether Trump was really under audit. He said he\u2019d asked for a copy of the audit to show reporters as proof but \u201cwas never able to obtain one.\u201d\n\u201cI presume that he is not under audit,\u201d Cohen said. He added that he believed Trump didn\u2019t want experts to start \u201cripping it to pieces,\u201d referring to his tax returns, which would prompt a likely audit.\n4:39 p.m. ET\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) argued the hush money reimbursement checks the Trump family allegedly gave Cohen constituted fraud.\n\u201cAre you telling us that the president directed transactions in conspiracy with [Trump Organization CFO] Allen Weisselberg and his son, Don Jr., as part of a criminal conspiracy of financial fraud?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cohen said.\n\u201cThere is garden-variety financial fraud,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cThere are three other people who are equally involved in this criminal conspiracy.\u201d\n4:31 p.m. ET\nAfter a House vote on universal background checks for gun purchases, the committee hearing is back in session.\n\u2015 Ani Vrabel\n3:07 p.m. ET\nKayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for the Trump campaign, issued this statement on Cohen\u2019s testimony:\n\u201cMichael Cohen is a felon, a disbarred lawyer, and a convicted perjurer, who lied to both Congress and the Special Counsel in a \u2018deliberate and premeditated\u2019 fashion according to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office. Now he offers what he says is evidence, but the only support for that is his own testimony, which has proven before to be worthless. As noted by the Southern District of New York, Cohen\u2019s wide array of crimes were \u2018marked by a pattern of deception that permeated his professional life\u2019 and his \u2018instinct to blame others is strong.\u2019 Prosecutors said his actions were to ensure that he would \u2018profit personally, build his own power, and enhance his level of influence.\u2019 This is the same Michael Cohen who has admitted that he lied to Congress previously. Why did they even bother to swear him in this time?\u201d\n2:33 p.m. ET\nThe chairman has called a recess, which he said will last approximately one hour.\n2:30 p.m. ET\nU.S. Virgin Islands Del. Stacey Plaskett (D) called on the House ethics committee to look into a tweet Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) post Tuesday, in which he questioned whether Cohen\u2019s wife and father-in-law know about his \u201cgirlfriends.\u201d Democrats accused Gaetz of attempting to intimidate Cohen ahead of his public hearing. The Republican lawmaker later deleted the tweet and apologized.\n\u201cI think that at the very least there should be a referral to the ethics committee of witness intimidation and tampering,\u201d Plaskett said, adding that Gaetz should potentially face criminal prosecution.\n2:24 p.m. ET\nIn a back and forth with Lawrence, Cohen said he feared for his family\u2019s safety because Trump uses his millions of social media followers against him.\nLawrence: \u201cWhat do you think he can do to you?\u201d\nCohen: \u201cA lot. And it\u2019s not just him. I don\u2019t walk with my wife when we go to a restaurant, I don\u2019t walk with my children.\u201d\n2:21 p.m. ET\nRep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) blasted Meadows for using Patton as a prop in an attempt to prove Trump isn\u2019t racist.\n\u201cI just want to put on the record as being a black American and having endured the public comments of racism from the sitting president as being a black person, I can only imagine what\u2019s being said in private,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to prop up one member of our entire race of black people and say that that nullifies that is in this environment of expecting a president to be inclusive and to look at his administration speaks volumes.\u201d\n2:16 p.m. ET\n\u201cPeople that follow Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences,\u201d Cohen said earlier in the hearing.\nWhen Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.) asked him about that comment, Cohen said others orbiting the president may end up in jail if they keep following him.\n1:58 p.m. ET\nCohen maintained while under oath that he has never been to Prague. The alleged trip was outlined in Steele\u2019s dossier on Trump. It suggested that Cohen went to the city in the Czech Republic in August 2016 to meet Russian operatives. Cohen has always refuted the claim, but this is his strongest denial yet.\n1:56 p.m. ET\nRep Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) said Dems were \u201cgrasping at straws\u201d with this hearing. Then she asked what Republicans have been asking all day: whether Cohen planned to pursue a book deal. He said he did.\n1:51 p.m. ET\nWhen asked about the existence of a video allegedly showing Trump hitting first lady Melania Trump in an elevator, Cohen said: \u201cThe story goes that he struck Melania in that elevator because there\u2019s a camera. \u2026 I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not true. \u2026 I don\u2019t think that he struck Mrs. Trump, ever.\u201d\nHe said he doesn\u2019t think that tape exists.\n1:47 p.m. ET\nCohen once again said David Pecker, publisher of the National Enquirer, had paid for and then not published additional stories on behalf of Trump. He specifically mentioned the story of Trump\u2019s alleged \u201clove child\u201d with an employee. Cohen said an elevator operator claimed to have overheard a conversation about the supposed child and that Pecker paid him to keep quiet. Trump got nervous when Pecker entertained thoughts of leaving the Enquirer, according to Cohen.\n\u201cWe were concerned about \u2015 we\u2019ll call it the \u2018treasure trove\u2019 of information that would be there if he left,\u201d Cohen said, adding that he discussed buying the rights to those stories.\n1:39 p.m. ET\nRep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) asked if Trump was telling the truth when he said he had never talked to Roger Stone about the stolen DNC emails.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Cohen said.\n\u201cIt was a short conversation,\u201d Cohen said. \u201c[Stone] said, \u2018Mr. Trump, I wanted to let you know I just got off the phone with Julian Assange, and in a couple days there\u2019s gonna be a massive dump of emails that is going to hurt [Hillary Clinton\u2019s] campaign.\u2019\u201d\n1:31 p.m. ET\nRep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) to Cohen: \u201cI\u2019ve arrested several thousand men, and you remind me of many of them.\u201d\n1:24 p.m. ET\nCohen told Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) that Trump spoke with him to coordinate a messaging strategy after the Wall Street Journal broke the story about a hush-money payment to Daniels in January 2018. In the days that followed, Cohen admitted he had used his personal funds to pay off Daniels. That was technically true, he told Hill \u2015 he just left out the part about the president planning to repay him. He said he helped craft statements to news organizations in order to protect Trump.\nCORRECTION: Katie Hill was previously referred to as a congresswoman who represents Texas. She represents California.\n1:17 p.m. ET\n1:13 p.m. ET\nWhen questioned about how Trump gave orders indirectly, Cohen said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give you orders. He speaks in code, and I understand the code because I\u2019ve been around him for a decade.\u201d\nThen Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) asked: \u201cWhat truth does [Trump] fear most?\u201d Cohen paused for several seconds before saying he didn\u2019t know how to answer.\n1:11 p.m. ET\n1:05 p.m. ET\n\u201cI have no reason to believe that tape exists,\u201d Cohen said when asked about the rumored existence of damaging video involving Trump.\nThe idea that Russian President Vladimir Putin had compromising information on Trump, including a so-called \u201cpee tape\u201d depicting him in sexual acts, was put forth in the dossier compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele in 2016. In his memoir, former FBI Director James Comey claimed that Trump was obsessed with disproving the allegation.\n12:57 p.m. ET\nCohen told the committee that although Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign was a moneymaking scheme, it shifted gears after Trump won the election. Only then did the campaign become about \u201cwhat to do here in Washington,\u201d Cohen said.\n12:52 p.m. ET\nRep. Michael Cloud (R-Texas) suggested that being in prison and getting a theoretical \u201cmillion-dollar book deal\u201d is \u201cnot a bad life.\u201d He asked Cohen whether he would commit to donating all proceeds from a future book deal.\n12:47 p.m. ET\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) wondered whether Trump\u2019s regular use of nondisclosure agreements may be silencing others with evidence of wrongdoing.\n\u201cDo you believe there are people out there today, from president\u2019s business or personal life, who are not coming forward due to the president\u2019s use of NDAs against them?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer that question,\u201d Cohen said.\n12:46 p.m. ET\nCohen said he could not discuss what, if anything, Trump or his aides communicated to him in the months after the FBI raided the former attorney\u2019s home and offices because it is presently under investigation by the Southern District of New York.\n12:42 p.m. ET\nCohen is shaking his head after Republicans speak. He noted earlier that none of them has asked him yet about Trump, only about his conviction for lying to Congress.\n\u2015 Andy Campbell\n12:41 p.m. ET\nCohen told Connolly that he met with Trump and attorney Jay Sekulow in the Oval Office prior to the August 2017 testimony in which he lied to Congress behind closed doors. Trump wanted to ensure Cohen would remain loyal, he said.\n12:35 p.m. ET\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled\u201d by Republicans trying to shift focus of the hearing to Cohen\u2019s lying, said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). He said Congress relies regularly on testimony from \u201cshady figures who are convicted of a lot worse crimes than you, Mr. Cohen.\u201d\nThe argument Republicans have been using to undermine Cohen would make every one of the government\u2019s organized crime convictions \u201cnull and void,\u201d Connolly said.\n\u2014 Andy Campbell and Sara Boboltz\n12:27 p.m. ET\nWe\u2019re back from the break, and Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) has accused Cohen of making his allegations for \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d and a book deal.\nShe asked Cohen if he would commit to not seeking a book deal or one day running for office. He said he would not commit to that.\n12:15 p.m. ET\nCohen requested a break, which was granted.\n12:14 p.m. ET\nWhen asked if Trump would directly threaten people who crossed him, Cohen replied, \u201cNo. He would use others. I\u2019m not so sure he had to hire them, they were already working there.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s sending out the message that this is his country; he\u2019s becoming an autocrat,\u201d he said.\n12:13 p.m. ET\nRep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) asked Cohen at what point in his life he decided to \u201cstart telling the truth.\u201d\n\u201cHelsinki, Charlottesville, watching the daily destruction of our civility to one another,\u201d Cohen responded. \u201cIt\u2019s that sort of behavior that I\u2019m responsible for. I\u2019m responsible for your silliness because I did the same type of thing you\u2019re doing now for 10 years.\u201d\n\u201cI protected Mr. Trump for 10 years and the fact that you pull up a news article that has no value to it and you want to use that as the premise for discrediting me, that I\u2019m not the person that people called at three in the morning would make you inaccurate,\u201d he added. \u201cIn actuality, it would make you a liar which puts you into the same position that I am in.\u201d\nCohen issued a warning to others who might follow Trump \u201cblindly\u201d: \u201cThey are going to suffer the same consequences that I\u2019m suffering.\u201d\n12:07 p.m. ET\nRepublicans continue to use their time to dunk on Cohen by reiterating that he\u2019s a convicted liar.\n\u201cHow could anyone listen to this pathological person?\u201d said Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.). \u201cThis is all about you.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cLiar, liar, pants on fire.\u201d\n11:56 a.m. ET\nDonald Trump Jr. jumps on Rep. Jim Jordan\u2019s assertion that Cohen\u2019s entire testimony is a plot to impeach the president.\n11:53 a.m. ET\nMeadows attempted to debunk Cohen\u2019s allegation that Trump is racist by pointing to Department of Housing and Urban Development official Lynne Patton, who is black. The lawmaker claimed Patton would never work for a man who is racist.\n\u201cNeither should I, as the son of a Holocaust survivor,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAsk Ms. Patton how many black people are executives at the Trump Organization. The answer is zero.\u201d\n11:48 a.m. ET\nCohen described to Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) how Trump would overvalue his assets in order to game Forbes magazine\u2019s list of wealthiest people. According to Cohen, Trump would estimate the value of his buildings with the highest price per square foot of similar buildings in the area, among other duplicitous strategies. Trump inflated his net worth by around $4 billion when he tried to obtain a loan from Deutsche Bank to buy the Buffalo Bills, Cohen said.\nHe also reiterated that Trump would use bogus metrics to inflate or deflate the value of his assets, saying the metrics would change depending on whether he was talking to media or insurance companies.\n\u2015 Andy Campbell and Sara Boboltz\n11:45 a.m. ET\nIn a heated line of questioning, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) asked Cohen how many times he had spoken to representatives of Novartis, which had paid him $1.2 million for access to Trump \u2015 or, in Cohen\u2019s words, his \u201cknowledge of the enigma of Donald Trump.\u201d\nCohen said he didn\u2019t know, then estimated he had talked to Novartis six times.\n11:44 a.m. ET\nA spokesman for Fordham University, which Trump attended for two years, confirmed to BuzzFeed News that one of his lawyers threatened the school with legal action if it released any of his grades.\n11:40 a.m. ET\nEleanor Holmes Norton (D), the congressional delegate from Washington, D.C., mentioned the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in which Trump talked about grabbing women\u2019s genitals, as well as the alleged affair with Daniels.\nCohen told Norton that then-campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks called him about the tape while he was visiting his daughter in London.\nHicks, according to Cohen, instructed Cohen to call the news organizations he \u201chad relationships with,\u201d saying \u201cwe need to spin this\u201d as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d\n\u2015 Sara Boboltz and Andy Campbell\n11:31 a.m. ET\nRep. James Comer (R-Ky.) asked Cohen what he would call himself since he described Trump as a \u201ccheat\u201d in his opening remarks.\n\u201cA fool,\u201d Cohen responded.\n11:27 a.m. ET\nCohen told Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) that \u201cthere is nothing that happens at the Trump Organization\u201d without Trump\u2019s knowledge and approval.\n11:21 a.m. ET\nSo far, Republicans are focusing on the fact that Cohen is an admitted liar and therefore not a credible witness.\n\u201cHe lies to banks \u2026 all of those lies were done on fraudulent documents. They were forged,\u201d said Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.). \u201cLadies and gentlemen, how on earth is this witness credible?\u201d\nCohen told Green that he has no reason to lie now that he is going to prison and said he expects to have \u201cno source of income while in federal penitentiary.\u201d He has been contacted about a potential book deal, he said, but nothing is in the works.\n\u2015 Andy Campbell and Sara Boboltz\n11:18 a.m. ET\nCohen deflected a question from Wasserman Schultz over whether Trump had worked with the Russians during his 2016 presidential campaign. He said simply that \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s desire to win would have him work with anyone.\u201d\n11:15 a.m. ET\nWasserman Schultz: \u201cWould [Trump] have the potential to collude or coordinate with a foreign power to win the election at all costs?\u201d\n\u2014 Andy Campbell\n11:15 a.m. ET\nJordan accused Cohen of wanting a job in the White House and behaving \u201cselfish[ly]\u201d when he didn\u2019t get a position more prestigious than personal attorney to Trump \u2015 implying that Cohen\u2019s testimony was a form of retribution.\n\u201cI was very proud to be personal attorney to the president of the United States,\u201d Cohen said emphatically.\n11:14 a.m. ET\nWhen Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) asked whether the Trump family could have been \u201ccompromised\u201d by a foreign agent before the election, Cohen responded, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u2014 Andy Campbell\n11:11 a.m. ET\nCohen chuckled when Jordan called him out over the @WomenForCohen fan account on Twitter that was set up during the 2016 presidential campaign. Cohen said he didn\u2019t personally set up the account and that it wasn\u2019t created to protect Trump\u2019s interests.\n\u201cWe were having fun,\u201d Cohen told Jordan. \u201cThat\u2019s what it was, sir. ... We were having fun during a stressful time.\u201d\n11:06 a.m. ET\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) pressured Cohen on false statements he has made unrelated to \u201cblind loyalty to the Trump family.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you failed to report 4 million in income to the IRS, did you do that to protect Donald Trump?\u201d Jordan asked.\n\u201cNo, I did not,\u201d Cohen answered.\n11:01 a.m. ET\n\u201cI have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump,\u201d Cohen said.\n11:00 a.m. ET\nCohen acknowledged he was disbarred in New York on Tuesday. Lawyers face automatic disbarment for a felony conviction under New York law.\n\u201cAs of yesterday, I am no longer a lawyer,\u201d he told Cummings. \u201cI have lost my law license amongst other things.\u201d\n\u2015 Hayley Miller\n10:59 a.m. ET\nCohen claimed Trump tweeted \u201cencouragement to someone to do harm to me and my family.\u201d Trump has a history of inciting violence among his followers.\n\u2015 Andy Campbell\n10:56 a.m. ET\nCohen provided images of two checks from Trump-linked bank accounts that totaled $70,000 \u2014 money he says was part of a repayment plan for the hush money Cohen gave Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence about the alleged affair between her and Trump.\nOne of the two checks, both dated after Trump\u2019s inauguration, was apparently signed by the president himself. Other reimbursement checks \u2014 there were 11 in total \u2014 were signed by Donald Trump Jr. and Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, Cohen said.\nHe also presented the committee with a copy of the $130,000 wire transfer to Daniels. Cohen said Trump instructed him to use his own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid the money being traced back to Trump.\n10:55 a.m. ET\nCohen said Trump once used a straw buyer to get a portrait of himself and then boasted about how much it had sold for.\n10:51 a.m. ET\nAn example Cohen gave of Trump being a \u201cconman\u201d related to his academic history.\n\u201cWhen I say conman, I\u2019m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores,\u201d he said.\n10:45 a.m. ET\nCohen alleged that the president is an \u201ceven worse\u201d racist in private and that he once asked Cohen \u2015 while Barack Obama was president of the United States \u2015 if he could name a country \u201crun by a black person that wasn\u2019t a \u2018shithole.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWhile we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid,\u201d Cohen said.\n10:44 a.m. ET\n\u201cDonald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great,\u201d Cohen said. He said Trump described his presidential campaign as the \u201cgreatest infomercial in history.\u201d\nCohen described his former boss as a complicated man capable of kindness and generosity, but who is not often kind and generous. Trump \u201chas become the worst version of himself\u201d since taking office, Cohen said.\n10:37 a.m. ET\nCohen gives his opening statement as Trump confidant Roger Stone \u2014 whose talks with Julian Assange about the DNC emails is a part of Cohen\u2019s revelations \u2014 is still very much embroiled in the Russia investigation.\n\u2014 Andy Campbell\n10:36 a.m. ET\nCohen said Trump lied about the Moscow real estate project because he \u201cnever expected to win\u201d the presidential election and the project offered him the potential to earn \u201chundreds of millions.\u201d\nHe said Trump implicitly directed him to lie, too.\n\u201cIn conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there\u2019s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThere were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me \u2018How\u2019s it going in Russia?\u2019 referring to the Moscow Tower project.\u201d\n10:30 a.m. ET\n10:27 a.m. ET\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) attacked Cohen\u2019s trustworthiness \u2014 a card members of his party will likely play repeatedly throughout the hearing. Jordan claimed that Lanny Davis, Cohen\u2019s attorney, had \u201cchoreographed\u201d the entire hearing as a \u201cloyalist\u201d to and \u201coperative\u201d for Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n10:20 a.m. ET\nThere won\u2019t be much questioning about the Russia investigation if Cummings has his way. He said he initially wanted to \u201climit the scope of the questioning\u201d to exclude Russia altogether but acknowledged Cohen\u2019s opening statement briefly mentions the investigation.\n\u2015 Andy Campbell\n10:19 a.m. ET\nCummings vowed there would be repercussions for Cohen if it were later found that he had withheld the truth.\n\u201cI will be the first one to refer those untruthful statements to DOJ,\u201d the chairman said. \u201cHe has a lot to lose if he lies.\u201d\n10:17 a.m. ET\nCummings addressed Cohen\u2019s history of lying to Congress and whether he could be trusted. The hearing, Cummings said, would give Americans the chance to decide for themselves.\n\u201cMr. Cohen admitted to violating campaign finance laws and other laws \u2026 in coordination with and at the direction of President Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cSome will certainly ask, if he was lying then, why should we believe him now? This is a legitimate question.\u201d\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we are in search of the truth,\u201d he added.\nCohen, meanwhile, says he is prepared to show some receipts to corroborate his allegations.\n\u2014 Andy Campbell and Sara Boboltz\n10:12 a.m. ET\n\u201cThe American people have a right to hear him so we\u2019re going to proceed,\u201d Cummings said of Cohen\u2019s testimony. The hearing moves forward.\n\u2015 Hayley Miller\n10:10 a.m. ET\nThe drama begins. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) initiated a vote to postpone the hearing because Cohen\u2019s testimony was released Tuesday night and not with 24 hours notice.\n\u2015 Andy Campbell\n9:50 a.m. ET",

The searches marked the first public sign of a criminal investigation that has threatened Trump&rsquo;s presidency and netted Cohen a three-year prison sentence for tax evasion and campaign-finance violations.</p>\n<p>The feds, who also scoured Cohen&rsquo;s hotel room and safe deposit box, seized more than 4 million electronic and paper files in the searches, more than a dozen mobile devices and iPads, 20 external hard drives, flash drives and laptops.</p>\n<p>Both Cohen and Trump cried foul over the raids, with Cohen&rsquo;s attorney at the time calling them &ldquo;completely inappropriate and unnecessary&rdquo; and the president taking to Twitter to declare that &ldquo;Attorney-client privilege is dead!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A court-ordered review ultimately found only a fraction of the seized material to be privileged.</p>\n<p>The raids on Cohen were triggered in part by a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller, who separately is looking into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>\n<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s release of the search warrant came nearly six weeks after U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III partially granted a request by several media organizations, including The Associated Press, that the search warrant be made public due to the high public interest in the case.</p>\n<p>The judge acknowledged prosecutors&rsquo; concerns that a wholesale release of the document &ldquo;would jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties,&rdquo; a ruling that revealed prosecutors are still investigating Cohen&rsquo;s illegal payments to two women to stay silent about alleged affairs with Trump.</p>\n<p>The judge ordered prosecutors to redact Cohen&rsquo;s personal information and details in the warrant that refer to ongoing investigations and several third-parties who have cooperated with the inquiry. But he authorized the release of details in the warrant that relate to Cohen&rsquo;s tax evasion and false statements to financial institutions charges, along with Cohen&rsquo;s conduct that did not result in criminal charges.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At this stage, wholesale disclosure of the materials would reveal the scope and direction of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing investigation,&rdquo; Pauley wrote in a ruling last month.</p>\n<p>Cohen pleaded guilty over the summer to failing to report more than $4 million in income to the IRS, making false statements to financial institutions and campaign-finance violations stemming from the hush-money payments he arranged for porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Cohen implicated Trump in his guilty plea, saying the president directed him to make the payments during his 2016 campaign.</p>",

The searches marked the first public sign of a criminal investigation that has threatened Trump\u2019s presidency and netted Cohen a three-year prison sentence for tax evasion and campaign-finance violations.\nThe feds, who also scoured Cohen\u2019s hotel room and safe deposit box, seized more than 4 million electronic and paper files in the searches, more than a dozen mobile devices and iPads, 20 external hard drives, flash drives and laptops.\nBoth Cohen and Trump cried foul over the raids, with Cohen\u2019s attorney at the time calling them \u201ccompletely inappropriate and unnecessary\u201d and the president taking to Twitter to declare that \u201cAttorney-client privilege is dead!\u201d\nA court-ordered review ultimately found only a fraction of the seized material to be privileged.\nThe raids on Cohen were triggered in part by a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller, who separately is looking into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nTuesday\u2019s release of the search warrant came nearly six weeks after U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III partially granted a request by several media organizations, including The Associated Press, that the search warrant be made public due to the high public interest in the case.\nThe judge acknowledged prosecutors\u2019 concerns that a wholesale release of the document \u201cwould jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties,\u201d a ruling that revealed prosecutors are still investigating Cohen\u2019s illegal payments to two women to stay silent about alleged affairs with Trump.\nThe judge ordered prosecutors to redact Cohen\u2019s personal information and details in the warrant that refer to ongoing investigations and several third-parties who have cooperated with the inquiry. But he authorized the release of details in the warrant that relate to Cohen\u2019s tax evasion and false statements to financial institutions charges, along with Cohen\u2019s conduct that did not result in criminal charges.\n\u201cAt this stage, wholesale disclosure of the materials would reveal the scope and direction of the Government\u2019s ongoing investigation,\u201d Pauley wrote in a ruling last month.\nCohen pleaded guilty over the summer to failing to report more than $4 million in income to the IRS, making false statements to financial institutions and campaign-finance violations stemming from the hush-money payments he arranged for porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Cohen implicated Trump in his guilty plea, saying the president directed him to make the payments during his 2016 campaign.",

He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cohen said several documents he submitted to the House panel will prove Trump engaged in &ldquo;conman&rdquo;-like behavior as well as financial misconduct.</p>\n<p>He provided two images of checks from Trump-linked bank accounts that were dated March 2017 and August 2017 and totaled $71,000. Cohen said the money was part of a repayment plan for his hush money payments to Daniels.</p>\n<blockquote data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p>TWO checks President Trump wrote to Michael Cohen in order to pay him back for hush money payments.

Other signs featured tweets from the @WomenForCohen fan account created during the 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>Cohen chuckled when Jordan brought up the @WomenForCohen account, alleging that he didn&rsquo;t personally set up the account and that it wasn&rsquo;t created to protect Trump&rsquo;s interests.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We were having fun,&rdquo; Cohen told Jordan. &ldquo;We were having fun during a stressful time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He later accused the GOP committee members of &ldquo;blindly&rdquo; following Trump as he once had and slamming their behavior as &ldquo;really unbecoming of Congress.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that sort of behavior that I&rsquo;m responsible for,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you&rsquo;re doing now for 10 years. I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>Cohen Said It&rsquo;s Possible Trump Was Compromised By A Foreign Agent</h3>\n<p>Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) asked whether he believed Trump would cooperate or collude with a foreign power to win the presidency, a possibility special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating as part of his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In your opinion and experience, would he have the potential to cooperate or collude with a foreign power to win the presidency at all costs?&rdquo; Wasserman Schultz asked.</p>\n<p>Cohen responded: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The former attorney said he wasn&rsquo;t sure whether Trump colluded, but he did think there was &ldquo;something odd about the back-and-forth praise&rdquo; Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have offered each other.</p>\n<p>Trump would overvalue his assets in order to move up on Forbes magazine&rsquo;s list of wealthiest people and when dealing with insurance companies, Cohen alleged.</p>\n<p>The former attorney claimed Trump once inflated his net worth by roughly $4 billion while pursuing a loan from Deutsche Bank to buy the Buffalo Bills football team.</p>\n<h3>Meadows Cited Black HUD Official In Attempt To Prove Trump Isn&rsquo;t Racist</h3>\n<p>The Republican lawmaker attempted to debunk Cohen&rsquo;s allegation that Trump is racist by referencing Department of Housing and Urban Development official Lynne Patton, who is black. He claimed Patton would never work for a man who is racist.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Neither should I, as the son of a Holocaust survivor,&rdquo; Cohen said. &ldquo;Ask Ms. Patton how many black people are executives at the Trump Organization. The answer is zero.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The incident sparked outrage among at least a couple committee members of color, including Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).</p>\n<p>Tlaib condemned Meadows&rsquo; &ldquo;racist&rdquo; use of Patton as a &ldquo;prop.&rdquo; Meadows lashed out at Tlaib, angrily disputing that he&rsquo;s racist and noting he has &ldquo;nieces and nephews&rdquo; of color.</p>\n<p>Tlaib later said she was not specifically calling Meadows a racist.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I do apologize if that&rsquo;s what it sounded like,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Asked if Trump would directly threaten people he wanted to intimidate, Cohen replied, &ldquo;No. He would use others. I&rsquo;m not so sure he had to hire them, they were already working there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sending out the message that this is his country; he&rsquo;s becoming an autocrat,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>Later during the hearing, Cohen said that while working for Trump, he threatened people &ldquo;quite a few times.&rdquo; He estimated as many as 500 times.</p>\n<h3>Cohen Said Trump Directed Him To Lie To The Public \u2015 And Melania \u2015 About Daniels Payments </h3>\n<p>The former attorney acknowledged that he previously lied about the president&rsquo;s awareness of the hush payments to Daniels, who alleges her sexual relationship with Trump occurred in 2006, just a few months after the president&rsquo;s third wife, Melania Trump, gave birth to the couple&rsquo;s son.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not only did I lie to the American people \u2015 I lied to the first lady,&rdquo; Cohen said. &ldquo;When the president called me, I was sitting in a car with a friend of mine and he had me speak to her and explain to the first lady.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3 data-rapid-cpos=\"143\" data-rapid-parsed=\"subsec\" data-rapid-subsec=\"paragraph\">Cohen Said Federal Prosecutors Are Investigating Other Possible Illegal Acts Committed By Trump</h3>\n<p>Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) asked Cohen if he&rsquo;s aware of any additional &ldquo;wrongdoing or illegal act&rdquo; linked to Trump that wasn&rsquo;t discussed in the hearing Wednesday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cohen responded. &ldquo;Those are part of the investigation that is currently being looked at by the (federal government&rsquo;s) Southern District of New York.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He said he could not elaborate, citing ongoing investigations.</p>\n<p>Asked about the rumored Russian blackmail on Trump, stemming in part from a so-called &ldquo;pee tape&rdquo; showing him involved in sexual acts, Cohen said he has &ldquo;no reason to believe that tape exists.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A dossier compiled in 2016 by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele suggested Putin had compromising information on Trump, including the alleged tape.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\"><p>Michael Cohen says he has &ldquo;no reason to believe that tape exists&rdquo; after he&rsquo;s asked if he&rsquo;s aware of anything Trump has done that may subject him to extortion or blackmail <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"32\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://t.co/oEziZtsEZd\">https://t.co/oEziZtsEZd</a> <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"33\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://t.co/lzcp6rcKJ4\">pic.twitter.com/lzcp6rcKJ4</a></p>&mdash; Yahoo News (@YahooNews) <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"34\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://twitter.com/YahooNews/status/1100820687223107584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2019</a></blockquote>",

                "text": "Michael Cohen, a former personal attorney for President Donald Trump, appeared before the House oversight committee Wednesday in a highly publicized hearing that produced several eyebrow-raising moments.\nAfter he delivered his explosive prepared testimony, lawmakers spent hours grilling Cohen about his past conversations and business dealings with Trump.\nWhile Democrats took a more measured approach in their exchanges with Cohen, Republicans tore into the former lawyer \u2015 he was recently disbarred \u2015 over his past lies to Congress and his willingness to turn on the president.\nHere are some of the wildest exchanges from the hearing:\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) accused Cohen of breaking committee rules by submitting his written prepared testimony less than 24 hours before the hearing. In a fiery display, Meadows called on the committee chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), to postpone the hearing.\nSeveral other Republicans, including its ranking GOP member, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, joined Meadows in his motion to delay the event.\nThe committee voted 24-17 to proceed with the hearing.\n\u201cEach of us in this room has this duty to serve as an independent check on the executive branch,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we are in search of the truth.\u201d\nRep. Mark Meadows asks to postpone Cohen hearing because he says the committee didn\u2019t get the opening statements and evidence in time.\nRep. Jim Jordan claims that CNN had the materials before they did. https://t.co/Ug4YCb7zux pic.twitter.com/XGG9DE6xiW\n\u2014 Yahoo News (@YahooNews) February 27, 2019\nAfter being sworn in, Cohen spent roughly 30 minutes reading his written prepared testimony, which was leaked to the media Tuesday evening.\nSome of the most jaw-dropping lines included Cohen calling the president a \u201cracist,\u201d claiming Trump knew of Wikileaks\u2019 plan in 2016 to publish hacked emails damaging to Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid, and alleging the president repaid him with personal checks for hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about an alleged affair with Trump.\n\u201cI am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump\u2019s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience,\u201d Cohen read from his testimony. \u201cI am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.\u201d\nCohen said several documents he submitted to the House panel will prove Trump engaged in \u201cconman\u201d-like behavior as well as financial misconduct.\nHe provided two images of checks from Trump-linked bank accounts that were dated March 2017 and August 2017 and totaled $71,000. Cohen said the money was part of a repayment plan for his hush money payments to Daniels.\nTWO checks President Trump wrote to Michael Cohen in order to pay him back for hush money payments. These have been submitted to Congress as exhibits for Cohen\u2019s testimony. pic.twitter.com/NLmcnupaWc\n\u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) February 27, 2019\nCohen also detailed threats he made to schools and the College Board on behalf of Trump to pressure them not to share information about his academic history.\n\u201cWhen I say conman, I\u2019m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores,\u201d he told the committee.\nFordham University confirmed the authenticity of a copy of a letter Cohen submitted to the committee in which he threatened to hold the institution liable to the fullest extent should they release Trump\u2019s educational records.\nGOP committee members frequently pointed out that Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison for a series of charges he pleaded guilty to last year, including lying to Congress.\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I see: I see a guy who\u2019s worked for 10 years and is here trashing the guy he worked for for 10 years, didn\u2019t get a job in the White House and now you\u2019re behaving just like everybody else who got fired or didn\u2019t get the job they wanted,\u201d Jordan told Cohen, who denied having ever wanted to work in the White House.\nThe Republican lawmakers also displayed posters apparently meant to embarrass Cohen and undermine his credibility.\n\u201cLiar liar pants on fire!\u201d stated one poster featuring a picture of Cohen\u2019s face. Other signs featured tweets from the @WomenForCohen fan account created during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nCohen chuckled when Jordan brought up the @WomenForCohen account, alleging that he didn\u2019t personally set up the account and that it wasn\u2019t created to protect Trump\u2019s interests.\n\u201cWe were having fun,\u201d Cohen told Jordan. \u201cWe were having fun during a stressful time.\u201d\nHe later accused the GOP committee members of \u201cblindly\u201d following Trump as he once had and slamming their behavior as \u201creally unbecoming of Congress.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s that sort of behavior that I\u2019m responsible for,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you\u2019re doing now for 10 years. I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years.\u201d\nCohen Said It\u2019s Possible Trump Was Compromised By A Foreign Agent\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) asked whether he believed Trump would cooperate or collude with a foreign power to win the presidency, a possibility special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating as part of his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\u201cIn your opinion and experience, would he have the potential to cooperate or collude with a foreign power to win the presidency at all costs?\u201d Wasserman Schultz asked.\nCohen responded: \u201cYes.\u201d\nThe former attorney said he wasn\u2019t sure whether Trump colluded, but he did think there was \u201csomething odd about the back-and-forth praise\u201d Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have offered each other.\nTrump would overvalue his assets in order to move up on Forbes magazine\u2019s list of wealthiest people and when dealing with insurance companies, Cohen alleged.\nThe former attorney claimed Trump once inflated his net worth by roughly $4 billion while pursuing a loan from Deutsche Bank to buy the Buffalo Bills football team.\nMeadows Cited Black HUD Official In Attempt To Prove Trump Isn\u2019t Racist\nThe Republican lawmaker attempted to debunk Cohen\u2019s allegation that Trump is racist by referencing Department of Housing and Urban Development official Lynne Patton, who is black. He claimed Patton would never work for a man who is racist.\n\u201cNeither should I, as the son of a Holocaust survivor,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAsk Ms. Patton how many black people are executives at the Trump Organization. The answer is zero.\u201d\nThe incident sparked outrage among at least a couple committee members of color, including Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).\nTlaib condemned Meadows\u2019 \u201cracist\u201d use of Patton as a \u201cprop.\u201d Meadows lashed out at Tlaib, angrily disputing that he\u2019s racist and noting he has \u201cnieces and nephews\u201d of color.\nTlaib later said she was not specifically calling Meadows a racist.\n\u201cI do apologize if that\u2019s what it sounded like,\u201d she said.\nAsked if Trump would directly threaten people he wanted to intimidate, Cohen replied, \u201cNo. He would use others. I\u2019m not so sure he had to hire them, they were already working there.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s sending out the message that this is his country; he\u2019s becoming an autocrat,\u201d he added.\nLater during the hearing, Cohen said that while working for Trump, he threatened people \u201cquite a few times.\u201d He estimated as many as 500 times.\nCohen Said Trump Directed Him To Lie To The Public \u2015 And Melania \u2015 About Daniels Payments\nThe former attorney acknowledged that he previously lied about the president\u2019s awareness of the hush payments to Daniels, who alleges her sexual relationship with Trump occurred in 2006, just a few months after the president\u2019s third wife, Melania Trump, gave birth to the couple\u2019s son.\n\u201cNot only did I lie to the American people \u2015 I lied to the first lady,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWhen the president called me, I was sitting in a car with a friend of mine and he had me speak to her and explain to the first lady.\u201d\nCohen Said Federal Prosecutors Are Investigating Other Possible Illegal Acts Committed By Trump\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) asked Cohen if he\u2019s aware of any additional \u201cwrongdoing or illegal act\u201d linked to Trump that wasn\u2019t discussed in the hearing Wednesday.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cohen responded. \u201cThose are part of the investigation that is currently being looked at by the (federal government\u2019s) Southern District of New York.\u201d\nHe said he could not elaborate, citing ongoing investigations.\nAsked about the rumored Russian blackmail on Trump, stemming in part from a so-called \u201cpee tape\u201d showing him involved in sexual acts, Cohen said he has \u201cno reason to believe that tape exists.\u201d\nA dossier compiled in 2016 by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele suggested Putin had compromising information on Trump, including the alleged tape.\nMichael Cohen says he has \u201cno reason to believe that tape exists\u201d after he\u2019s asked if he\u2019s aware of anything Trump has done that may subject him to extortion or blackmail https://t.co/oEziZtsEZd pic.twitter.com/lzcp6rcKJ4\n\u2014 Yahoo News (@YahooNews) February 27, 2019",

The vice president has come under fire over his views on same-sex marriage, transgender rights and conversion therapy. His wife, Karen Pence, announced in January that she had taken a job teaching art at a school that bans LGBTQ employees and students.\nShort left his role as White House legislative affairs director in July 2018, citing \u201cdiminishing returns\u201d in advancing Trump\u2019s agenda. He is expected to assume the role of Pence\u2019s chief of staff in March after Nick Ayers stepped down in January.",

Thanks to the new lower federal income tax rates, Callori&rsquo;s employer, a financial services firm, was withholding less from her paycheck for federal tax purposes.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I thought, &lsquo;Wow, Trump is great, I love him,&rsquo;&rdquo; Callori said.</p>\n<p>But last week Callori heard from her tax preparer that she owes the federal government more than $5,000 \u2015 almost five times as much as she had to pay in previous years.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I almost fell out of my chair. I could not believe it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I voted for Trump. I thought he was going to be good for this country, but when I got that phone call, that&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Callori&rsquo;s tax bill went up for two reasons. One is that the law directly disadvantaged her by limiting deductions for state and local taxes, which increased the amount of Callori&rsquo;s income subject to tax and added an extra grand to her bill.</p>\n<p>The bigger reason is that her employer withheld too little from her paycheck. The extra $90 she received should have been added to the amount that gets automatically socked away to cover the federal income tax. Like most people, however, Callori did not fill out a worksheet and submit a new Form W-4 to her employer at the beginning of last year.</p>\n<p>After all, at that time Republicans kept bragging about the bigger paychecks they had given the American people.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I thought because I was getting that, I&rsquo;m entitled to it,&rdquo; Callori said.</p>\n<h3><strong>Bigger Paychecks, Lower Refunds </strong></h3>\n<p>The vast majority of Americans got lower taxes from the new law, while only 5 percent or so should have seen a tax increase. Most people should have seen the changes in their paychecks last February.</p>\n<p>But the way the Trump administration implemented the law has caused a separate problem \u2015 one that the administration knew would result in something like 5 million fewer households receiving tax refunds this year. It&rsquo;s still early in tax filing season, which opened at the end of January, but the average refund is <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"4\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"subsec:paragraph;cpos:13;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-season-statistics-for-week-ending-february-8-2019\">down 8.7 percent</a> so far.</p>\n<p>The Treasury Department suggested tax refunds are bad anyway because they result from people overpaying the government.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Smaller refunds mean that people are withholding appropriately based on their tax liability, which is positive news for taxpayers,&rdquo; a spokesperson said in an email.</p>\n<p>The problem is, it&rsquo;s not just smaller refunds \u2015 it&rsquo;s that paycheck withholding for this tax season is less accurate in general.</p>\n<p>Treasury has said it expected the percentage of people withholding too much tax in their paychecks to decline from 76 to 73 percent, but the percentage withholding accurately is not increasing at all. Instead, Treasury expected the rate of under-withholding to go from 18 to 21 percent. Those people all owe the IRS.</p>\n<p>The households most at risk are ones with higher incomes, two earners and slightly more complicated taxes \u2015 especially households that used to itemize their deductions. Instead of taking the standard deduction, which reduces taxable income by a set value, itemizers would add up what they spent on state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable giving, and deduct that sum instead. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act greatly reduced the advantage of itemizing and limited the deduction for state and local tax.</p>\n<h3><strong>Politics Over Planning</strong></h3>\n<p>But the Trump administration decided not to make major changes to the withholding tables that employers are required to use to make sure everybody is paying the right amount of tax. The value of &ldquo;allowances&rdquo; that workers can choose on Form W-4 to adjust their withholding has been pegged for years to something called the personal exemption \u2015 which the new tax law eliminated. So they set the value of allowances to last year&rsquo;s personal exemption and adjusted for inflation.</p>\n<p>Coming up with new forms would have taken at least half a year, and would have been a chore for everyone.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this tension &hellip; You&rsquo;d like to get all the information needed to calculate withholding as accurately as possible, but that gets very complicated for taxpayers,&rdquo; said Joe Rosenberg, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center.</p>\n<p>The administration could have let people withhold too much rather than surprise them with bills at tax time, Democrats have said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It looks like the Trump Treasury Department spent 2018, an election year, goosing people&rsquo;s paychecks by under-withholding, and it should have been obvious that the bill would come due eventually,&rdquo; Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a statement Friday.</p>\n<p>The IRS did try to warn people to check their withholding. The agency <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"11\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"subsec:paragraph;cpos:25;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-548\">told the Government Accountability Office</a> that it put out press releases and sent emails to listservs with hundreds of thousands of subscribers. It promoted a &ldquo;paycheck checkup&rdquo; campaign on Twitter and Facebook, and officials talked to the media.</p>\n<p>The &ldquo;make sure you&rsquo;re not underwithheld&rdquo; messaging may have been drowned out by congressional Republicans bragging that their law had turbocharged the economy and directly benefited millions of workers. They kept a running tally of the hundreds of firms that had announced bonuses for their employees, trumpeting each announcement in a series of <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"12\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"subsec:paragraph;cpos:26;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://mailchi.mp/press.speaker.gov/a-big-deal-for-small-biz?e=a24835725a\">press releases</a>. Fox News worked overtime to remind people that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi previously called the bonuses &ldquo;crumbs,&rdquo; as though that weren&rsquo;t a <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"13\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"subsec:paragraph;cpos:26;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-is-right-about-workers-getting-crumbs-from-the-tax-bill_n_5a7dc5cbe4b0c6726e12ce62\">perfectly accurate description</a>.</p>\n<p>Another problem, which is not Republicans&rsquo; fault, is that even though everyone pays taxes, not everyone understands them very well. Less than half of Americans said they knew they could update their W-4 forms at any time and only 19 percent had actually done so, according to a November survey by the tax prep company H&amp;R Block. Twice as many survey respondents said they updated their W-2, which is actually a document prepared by employers, not workers.</p>\n<p>Also, some filers are surprised by tax bills simply because they didn&rsquo;t realize some of the money they earned needed to be taxed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have some side job where there&rsquo;s no withholding and that&rsquo;s creating this new tax liability,&rdquo; H&amp;R Block&rsquo;s Nathan Rigney said, pointing to the rise of non-employee gigs like Uber and Taskrabbit.</p>\n<h3><strong>Crunching Numbers </strong></h3>\n<p>By capping deductions for state and local taxes, Republicans knew the tax hikes in their law would be concentrated on states with high taxes \u2015 which tend to be led by Democrats, who use the taxes to provide more social services.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not just wealthy New Yorkers who&rsquo;ve wound up paying more.</p>\n<p>Kurt Kromm is an electrician in Kenosha, Wisconsin \u2015 an area that used to be represented by former House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Kromm knew he and his wife would pay higher taxes because of the limit on deductions for state and local taxes, but he didn&rsquo;t think they would owe more than $4,000 this spring.</p>\n<p>Kromm had already indicated on the Form W-4 documents he&rsquo;d previously submitted to his employer that he was married and wanted zero allowances, which means he was withholding as much as he could without specifying an additional dollar amount.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I figured married and zero would probably be appropriate,&rdquo; Kromm said. &ldquo;They spent no time trying to really put out a decent withholding table.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Kromm&rsquo;s case shows the two-earner household pitfall. After he realized how much he owes, he went to the <a data-rapid-parsed=\"slk\" data-rapid_p=\"14\" data-v9y=\"0\" data-ylk=\"subsec:paragraph;cpos:35;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/individuals/irs-withholding-calculator\">withholding calculator on IRS.gov</a> and realized he could have either told his employer to take an additional $80 per week or just chosen to withhold at a single rate on his W-4, since single people face higher rates and therefore higher withholding. If he had done so last year, he could have had less money in each paycheck but saved himself the aggravation of making a large payment.</p>\n<p>But not even the administration expected people to go to such lengths \u2015 in its simulations of how people would be affected, the IRS assumed nobody would adjust their W-4s.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unreasonable to expect working people with busy lives to start the year out by crunching the numbers on their tax withholding with the rigor of a workaholic [certified public accountant],&rdquo; Wyden said.</p>\n<p>Beth Callori, for her part, said she had also previously chosen zero allowances \u2015 plus she had an extra $130 withheld from each paycheck. It wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>\n<p>She said she used to love Donald Trump. Not anymore.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I really liked things he was doing, until this, and now I hate him,&rdquo; she said.</p>",

Those people all owe the IRS.\nThe households most at risk are ones with higher incomes, two earners and slightly more complicated taxes \u2015 especially households that used to itemize their deductions. Instead of taking the standard deduction, which reduces taxable income by a set value, itemizers would add up what they spent on state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable giving, and deduct that sum instead. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act greatly reduced the advantage of itemizing and limited the deduction for state and local tax.\nPolitics Over Planning\nBut the Trump administration decided not to make major changes to the withholding tables that employers are required to use to make sure everybody is paying the right amount of tax. The value of \u201callowances\u201d that workers can choose on Form W-4 to adjust their withholding has been pegged for years to something called the personal exemption \u2015 which the new tax law eliminated. So they set the value of allowances to last year\u2019s personal exemption and adjusted for inflation.\nComing up with new forms would have taken at least half a year, and would have been a chore for everyone.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this tension \u2026 You\u2019d like to get all the information needed to calculate withholding as accurately as possible, but that gets very complicated for taxpayers,\u201d said Joe Rosenberg, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center.\nThe administration could have let people withhold too much rather than surprise them with bills at tax time, Democrats have said.\n\u201cIt looks like the Trump Treasury Department spent 2018, an election year, goosing people\u2019s paychecks by under-withholding, and it should have been obvious that the bill would come due eventually,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a statement Friday.\nThe IRS did try to warn people to check their withholding. The agency told the Government Accountability Office that it put out press releases and sent emails to listservs with hundreds of thousands of subscribers. It promoted a \u201cpaycheck checkup\u201d campaign on Twitter and Facebook, and officials talked to the media.\nThe \u201cmake sure you\u2019re not underwithheld\u201d messaging may have been drowned out by congressional Republicans bragging that their law had turbocharged the economy and directly benefited millions of workers. They kept a running tally of the hundreds of firms that had announced bonuses for their employees, trumpeting each announcement in a series of press releases. Fox News worked overtime to remind people that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi previously called the bonuses \u201ccrumbs,\u201d as though that weren\u2019t a perfectly accurate description.\nAnother problem, which is not Republicans\u2019 fault, is that even though everyone pays taxes, not everyone understands them very well. Less than half of Americans said they knew they could update their W-4 forms at any time and only 19 percent had actually done so, according to a November survey by the tax prep company H&R Block. Twice as many survey respondents said they updated their W-2, which is actually a document prepared by employers, not workers.\nAlso, some filers are surprised by tax bills simply because they didn\u2019t realize some of the money they earned needed to be taxed. \u201cThey\u2019ll have some side job where there\u2019s no withholding and that\u2019s creating this new tax liability,\u201d H&R Block\u2019s Nathan Rigney said, pointing to the rise of non-employee gigs like Uber and Taskrabbit.\nCrunching Numbers\nBy capping deductions for state and local taxes, Republicans knew the tax hikes in their law would be concentrated on states with high taxes \u2015 which tend to be led by Democrats, who use the taxes to provide more social services.\nBut it\u2019s not just wealthy New Yorkers who\u2019ve wound up paying more.\nKurt Kromm is an electrician in Kenosha, Wisconsin \u2015 an area that used to be represented by former House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Kromm knew he and his wife would pay higher taxes because of the limit on deductions for state and local taxes, but he didn\u2019t think they would owe more than $4,000 this spring.\nKromm had already indicated on the Form W-4 documents he\u2019d previously submitted to his employer that he was married and wanted zero allowances, which means he was withholding as much as he could without specifying an additional dollar amount.\n\u201cI figured married and zero would probably be appropriate,\u201d Kromm said. \u201cThey spent no time trying to really put out a decent withholding table.\u201d\nKromm\u2019s case shows the two-earner household pitfall. After he realized how much he owes, he went to the withholding calculator on IRS.gov and realized he could have either told his employer to take an additional $80 per week or just chosen to withhold at a single rate on his W-4, since single people face higher rates and therefore higher withholding. If he had done so last year, he could have had less money in each paycheck but saved himself the aggravation of making a large payment.\nBut not even the administration expected people to go to such lengths \u2015 in its simulations of how people would be affected, the IRS assumed nobody would adjust their W-4s.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable to expect working people with busy lives to start the year out by crunching the numbers on their tax withholding with the rigor of a workaholic [certified public accountant],\u201d Wyden said.\nBeth Callori, for her part, said she had also previously chosen zero allowances \u2015 plus she had an extra $130 withheld from each paycheck. It wasn\u2019t enough.\nShe said she used to love Donald Trump. Not anymore.\n\u201cI really liked things he was doing, until this, and now I hate him,\u201d she said.",

                "text": "In a more normal time, if a woman alleged the man who would become the U.S. president kissed her without consent, it might be a major national story meriting weeks of intense news coverage.\nBut the current president is Donald Trump, who has now been accused of sexual misconduct and harassment by more than twenty women, who was caught on tape boasting about groping, and who was elected to office anyway. So when Alva Johnson, a former Trump campaign staffer, revealed last month that Trump had forcibly kissed her prior to his election, her name was added to the long list, and the news cycle mostly moved on.\nOther women who have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct and misbehavior are disappointed he has faced no repercussions, several told HuffPost. They feel as if many people simply don\u2019t care. They also recognize there are so many accusations of wrongdoing by Trump at this point, it\u2019s hard to keep track. But they support Johnson \u2014 and would still encourage other possible victims to come forward.\nRachel Crooks was not surprised to see Johnson\u2019s claim because \u201cwe\u2019ve seen this type of behavior from [Trump] over decades,\u201d she told HuffPost in an email. She has alleged Trump forcibly kissed her without her consent more than ten years ago, when she was 22.\n\u201cI was also sad because we\u2019ve let Alva Johnson down,\u201d she added. \u201cIf our society would\u2019ve held Trump accountable for his actions, she may not have had to endure this.\u201d\nJohnson claims in her lawsuit, filed last month against Trump in federal court, that in August of 2016 when she was working as a staffer for Trump\u2019s campaign, he forcibly kissed her on the mouth. She tried to avoid the kiss by turning her head away, and the incident left her confused and humiliated. Johnson, who is black, also says she experienced race and gender discrimination and was underpaid compared to white and male employees.\nI was also sad because we\u2019ve let Alva Johnson down. If our society would\u2019ve held Trump accountable for his actions, she may not have had to endure this.\nLess than two months after Trump allegedly kissed Johnson without consent, The Washington Post published the Access Hollywood tape, where Trump bragged that he could grab women \u201cby the pussy.\u201d Many women subsequently went public about their own interactions with Trump. Johnson was horrified by the tape, according to her lawsuit, because the conduct Trump boasted of was so similar to what she had experienced. She quit his campaign shortly afterward, the lawsuit says.\n\u201cIt seems right now we\u2019re going backward,\u201d Johnson told Teen Vogue in an interview published this month. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t appropriate for a long time. Now the most powerful man in the world is making fun of people who are coming forward [about sexual abuse], calling them liars even though their stories are so consistent.\u201d\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called Johnson\u2019s accusation \u201cabsurd on its face.\u201d Trump has repeatedly denied allegations of sexual misconduct against him. \u201cYou are a disgusting human being,\u201d he told a New York Times reporter who questioned him about some of the women\u2019s claims. He dismissed his comments in the Access Hollywood tape as \u201clocker-room banter.\u201d He also in 2016 threatened to sue his accusers. That never happened.\nIt was only a matter of time before someone from Trump\u2019s campaign or administration had a similar experience to what other women have been speaking about for years now, said Samantha Holvey, a former Miss North Carolina USA.\nHolvey said that when she met Trump at an event prior to the Miss USA pageant in 2006, he eyed her like a \u201cpiece of meat.\u201d She had \u201cnever felt so objectified and dirty,\u201d she said. A few days later, she said, she was in her robe in the hair and makeup area, and he walked in, in a way that felt to her like he \u201cwanted to exert his dominance and power.\u201d (Trump has bragged about getting away with going backstage when contestants were getting dressed, though his campaign generally denied claims that he did so.)\n\u201cHe\u2019s been sexually assaulting and harassing women for decades with no repercussions so why would he stop now?\u201d Holvey told HuffPost in an email.\nAlthough some women have accused Trump of behavior that fits the definition of groping, many of the reported incidents occurred a long time ago, and the statutes of limitations have expired. Johnson hopes to get justice, not just for herself, but all the victims, her attorney, Hassan Zavareei, told HuffPost a phone interview.\nHe\u2019s been sexually assaulting and harassing women for decades with no repercussions so why would he stop now?\nMost of her friends and family, even strangers on the street, have been encouraging to Johnson, Zavareei said. But \u201cTrump\u2019s behavior and bad actions have become so normalized, that it barely registers on the public consciousness,\u201d he added.\nPart of the reason Johnson wanted to come forward, he added, was to say, \u201cit\u2019s not normal, it\u2019s not okay.\u201d He raised the question of how the public might react if the accused were another president.\nThe living former president whose alleged conduct perhaps comes closest is Bill Clinton, who was repeatedly accused of sexual misconduct and whose affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky has drawn fresh scrutiny over the unequal power dynamics. In Clinton\u2019s case, he denied the misconduct allegations, however, the Republican-led House of Representatives moved to impeach him.\nThe climate is different now. The Me Too movement has ousted powerful men from their jobs and led to legal repercussions in some cases: Ex-film mogul Harvey Weinstein could face life in prison if convicted of sex offenses; Bill Cosby has already been convicted of aggravated indecent assault. Women who\u2019ve accused Trump of sexual misconduct would also like to see him face consequences \u2014 but they aren\u2019t optimistic.\n\u201cIt would be nice to see something happen to him \u2014 it would be nice that he doesn\u2019t get re-elected,\u201d said Kristin Anderson, who claims Trump reached under her skirt and groped her at a nightclub in the early 1990s. The fact that he got elected the first time, despite the allegations against him, shows some people, \u201creally don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s abuse. If it were them, they would care,\u201d she told HuffPost in a phone interview.\nShe\u2019d like to see, at a minimum, Trump apologize and change his ways, she said. But based on what Johnson says happened to her, it looks like \u201che\u2019s still up to it,\u201d she added.\nThe women HuffPost spoke with said they would still encourage women to come forward with their experiences.\n\u201cThe more people who do it, the more it shows \u2014 it should at least \u2014 what kind of character he is,\u201d said another woman who has publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct but asked not to be named because she fears the consequences for her family if she continues to speak out.\nFor women who speak out, \u201cwhether he\u2019s held accountable or not, you\u2019ve released it,\u201d Anderson said, noting she feels that it\u2019s women speaking up for themselves that\u2019s the most important part. \u201cIt\u2019s very healing, and that\u2019s what counts.\u201d",

The tweetbomb prompted observers to wonder whether Sanders was getting under the president\u2019s skin \u2015 a notion later floated by the senator himself.\nIn one tweet, Trump predicted that Sanders and \u201cSleepy Joe Biden\u201d would be the top contenders for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020.\n\u201cI look forward to facing whoever it may be. May God Rest Their Soul!\u201d Trump declared, without explaining his use of the apparently morbid phrase.\nTrump also took aim at Sanders\u2019 income as well as the senator\u2019s Monday interview on Fox News, in which Sanders lambasted the president as a \u201cpathological liar.\u201d\nTrump said it was \u201cweird\u201d to watch Sanders on his preferred news network and suggested, without evidence, that Fox News had prevented Trump supporters from entering the studio.\nMany Trump Fans & Signs were outside of the @FoxNews Studio last night in the now thriving (Thank you President Trump) Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for the interview with Crazy Bernie Sanders. Big complaints about not being let in-stuffed with Bernie supporters. What\u2019s with @FoxNews?\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2019\nBernie Sanders and wife should pay the Pre-Trump Taxes on their almost $600,000 in income. He is always complaining about these big TAX CUTS, except when it benefits him. They made a fortune off of Trump, but so did everyone else - and that\u2019s a good thing, not a bad thing!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2019\nI believe it will be Crazy Bernie Sanders vs. Sleepy Joe Biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best Economy in the history of our Country (and MANY other great things)! I look forward to facing whoever it may be. May God Rest Their Soul!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2019\nReacting to Trump\u2019s Twitter tirade, Sanders said Tuesday night that the president appeared to be \u201cscared of our campaign.\u201d\nSanders has emerged as the leader of the Democratic presidential fundraising pack, with $18.2 million raised so far this year. According to a March poll by Fox News, both Sanders and former Vice President Biden are more popular among voters than Trump.",

                "text": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday vetoed a resolution to end U.S. support of Saudi Arabia\u2019s military campaign in Yemen, which has been blamed for tens of thousands of deaths in the region.\n\u201cThis resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,\u201d Trump said in a statement accompanying his veto.\nThe Senate passed the resolution by a slim majority in March, and the House did the same earlier this month. It was a rare use of the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which gives Congress the power to remove military forces from a conflict for which there\u2019s been no formal declaration of war.\nThe measure was passed by a bipartisan group of senators, including seven Republican senators who broke ranks with their party leaders. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had urged lawmakers to reject the resolution at the time, saying it was \u201cinappropriate and counterproductive.\u201d\nThe veto was Trump\u2019s second of his administration. He issued his first last month, blocking Congress\u2019 attempt to end a \u201cnational emergency\u201d declaration meant to obtain funds to build a wall along the southern border.\nThe move on Tuesday drew a quick backlash of rebukes, including from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has long been critical of the Yemeni conflict.\n\u201cI am disappointed, but not surprised, that Trump has rejected the bi-partisan resolution to end U.S. involvement in the horrific war in Yemen,\u201d Sanders, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, said in a statement. \u201cThe people of Yemen desperately need humanitarian help, not more bombs.\u201d\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) lambasted the president, saying he had \u201ccynically chosen to contravene a bipartisan, bicameral vote of the Congress.\u201d\nThis conflict must end, now. The House of Representatives calls on the President to put peace before politics, and work with us to advance an enduring solution to end this crisis and save lives.\n\u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) April 17, 2019\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who sits on the chamber\u2019s Foreign Relations Committee, also condemned the move as a \u201chuge mistake.\u201d\n\u201cThe civil war in Yemen is a humanitarian crisis, and we have no business still being a part of it,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling on the United States to get out of the civil war in Yemen for the last four years, and this veto won\u2019t stop me.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s apparent fondness for Saudi Arabia has drawn the ire of many lawmakers, particularly after last year\u2019s killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post. American intelligence agencies determined that the order to murder Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul came directly from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. But the president has refused to condemn the crown prince for his role, instead saying that he stood by the Saudis.\n\u201cIt could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t,\u201d Trump said in November. \u201cIn any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\nAmerica supplies billions in arms sales to Riyadh, and the U.S. military has helped train the Saudi air force while advising the country on its war effort, according to a December report in The New York Times. In Washington, lawmakers have grown increasingly concerned about the deaths of civilians during airstrikes in Yemen, a toll that has continued to rise.\nThe war in Yemen has caused the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. The United Nations estimated in February that 24 million people \u2015 about 80% of Yemen\u2019s population \u2015 were in need of assistance and that hundreds of thousands were at risk of starvation due to a famine.\n\u201cWe remain keenly aware that a sustainable peace ... would be the most effective remedy for the humanitarian crisis in Yemen,\u201d Mark Lowcock, the U.N. humanitarian chief, said this week. \u201cWithout peace, we will simply go on treating the symptoms of this crisis, instead of addressing the cause. Let me summarize: Violence has again increased. The relief operation is running out of money. Barring changes, the end is nigh.\u201d\nThis article has been updated with responses from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chris Murphy.",
