There she is. How are you today, friend? Play with us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The room was sunny, with views of New York Harbor and the soaring spans of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. The walls were painted a reassuring pastel yellow, and it was decorated with plush, child-size armchairs and padded floor mats. Behind a toddler-scaled wooden table, baskets woven from rainbow-dyed yarn overflowed with soft toys. Once they finished singing, the children were let loose to explore, alongside their mothers and several clinicians, who sat on the floor beside them, speaking little but encouraging everyone to play.</p>\n<p>After an hour, the mothers left the children and went next door, to a room with adult-size chairs, for an hour of grown-up talk with Dr. Anne Murphy, a psychologist and founder of the Group Attachment Based Intervention (GABI) program. Three days a week, families with children up to three years old <a href=\"https://pix11.com/2017/07/20/special-sites-opening-throughout-city-to-provide-support-for-at-risk-families-with-young-children/\">come to GABI centers</a> in St. George and six other New York City neighborhoods for two-hour drop-in sessions, during which parents&mdash;low-income, often socially isolated parents&mdash;can meet in a welcoming, nonjudgmental environment.</p>\n<p>The GABI centers are designed to be high-end experiences, with inviting rooms, upscale furniture, and the sort of &ldquo;Mommy and Me&rdquo; vibe you might find in the more affluent parts of Brooklyn or Manhattan. Staff members put together videos documenting the progress the children make, note how the mothers take their coffee, and even on occasion call them in the evenings to check in, if they know they&rsquo;ve had a stressful day. They are the sort of places you&rsquo;d <em>want</em> to bring your kid, if you had the money to spend.</p>\n<p>The mothers in Staten Island were largely not at the GABI center out of choice, but because they had to be; most, if not all, had open prevention cases with the Administration for Children&rsquo;s Services (ACS), New York City&rsquo;s child welfare agency.</p>\n<p>Murphy founded the first GABI center at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx in 2010. In 2017, ACS partnered with her to expand the program and open centers in every borough, in areas with frequent reports of child abuse or neglect&mdash;terms that can encompass a wide range of circumstances, from bruising and other visible signs of mistreatment to things like frequent absence from school, excessive fatigue or hunger, or simply walking home alone. Many calls to the city&rsquo;s child abuse hotline come from teachers and hospital staff, who are required by law to report signs of abuse or neglect. In Staten Island, most of the reports <a href=\"http://www.centernyc.org/child-welfare-nyc/2012/06/whats-the-matter-with-staten-island\">come from</a> St. George and neighboring Stapleton.</p>\n<p>The goal of the GABI program is to provide support to parents and keep problems from escalating to the point where children need to be removed from their homes and placed in foster care. It is guided by the fact that, while serious child abuse does occur, it&rsquo;s rare, and many issues that fall under the broad umbrella of &ldquo;neglect&rdquo;&mdash;which alone <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/acs/pdf/data-analysis/2017/CityCouncilReport2017Annual.pdf\">accounts for 73 percent</a> of all allegations of child maltreatment made to ACS&mdash;are simply the everyday struggles of low-income families. In New York, <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/acs/pdf/data-analysis/2018/AbuseNeglectInvestByCommDistrictYrs2014To2017.pdf\">the ten neighborhoods</a> with the highest number of ACS cases, mostly in the Bronx, also represent the lowest incomes, highest unemployment, and greatest income-to-rent disparities in the city. Eight of those neighborhoods are the top places from which families enter homeless shelters. They&rsquo;re also neighborhoods inhabited predominantly by people of color. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not neglect,&rdquo; said Jeanette Vega, the training director at Rise, a New York nonprofit that advocates for parents with open ACS cases. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re poor&mdash;this is poverty.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This recognition that poor parents need help, not suspicion and condemnation, represents a substantial departure from the understanding many families have of ACS. All too often, family defense advocates say, ACS caseworkers visit families in the middle of the night&mdash;a tactic that is supposed to be reserved for emergencies in which children are in imminent danger&mdash;demanding that parents wake their children so they can inspect their bodies for bruises, interview them alone, check their bedrooms, and take stock of the food in the kitchen cupboards. Preventive services like parenting classes or counseling sessions for mental health, substance abuse, or domestic violence&mdash;technically voluntary, but refused at parents&rsquo; risk&mdash;are often preventive in name only and do little to address at-risk families&rsquo; greatest needs, only increasing the burdens on parents who are already stretched thin, making it more likely that they will be forced to relinquish their children to foster care. &ldquo;With some cases, I almost struggle to use the word &lsquo;services,&rsquo; because I think most families wouldn&rsquo;t describe them as services,&rdquo; said Chris Gottlieb, the co-director of the Family Defense Clinic at the New York University School of Law. &ldquo;People call me all the time, saying, &lsquo;I reached out to ACS for help, and it destroyed my family.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At the GABI center in St. George, one woman with a quiet voice and long, dark hair described her terror when ACS banged on her door in the middle of the night, demanding to speak to her children. &ldquo;I was so scared,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought they were going to take my kids.&rdquo; Another mother nodded her agreement. &ldquo;They want to put you in that state of fear,&rdquo; she said. A third spoke of how she&rsquo;d been taken from her own mother at age eleven, separated from her younger brother, and shuffled through nine foster and group homes, some of which were abusive. She emerged traumatized and struggled to rekindle her relationships with her siblings. And now, as a parent, she said ACS continued to hound her, showing up at her door or at her daughters&rsquo; school in response to what she said were false reports of domestic violence, waiting for her to slip up. &ldquo;For people like me, who&rsquo;ve been in the system,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;ACS is a place I hate.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The women viewed the GABI program differently, however. At the center in St. George, they felt respected, even loved. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of ACS,&rdquo; said one mother, &ldquo;but then you think, &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m going to the GABI program. It&rsquo;s completely different.&rsquo;&rdquo; The GABI initiative, along with several other pilot programs in New York, are part of a major effort by ACS to counteract its image as a &ldquo;baby-snatching&rdquo; police force riddled with the same racial and economic biases that beset actual law enforcement in the United States. Together, the programs amount to an experiment: to see whether one of the largest child welfare agencies in the country can change the dynamics that have poisoned its relationship with the vulnerable families it seeks to serve and must oversee. It&rsquo;s a sort of idealistic gamble, deeply informed by critics who charge that child welfare agencies like ACS unfairly target the poor and the nonwhite, and treat all family crises with the hammer of child removal.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It used to be in the Bronx projects that all you had to do was shout, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a cop in the hall,&rsquo; and people would flee,&rdquo; said Martin Guggenheim, a law professor at NYU and a national expert on child welfare. &ldquo;Now you say, &lsquo;ACS is on the ground,&rsquo; and people flee. That&rsquo;s one of the saddest parts: This is a <em>helping</em> agency, meant to support poor families, and the parents are terrified of the very agency whose charge is to support them.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;I was so scared,&rdquo; one woman said, describing her terror when ACS banged on her door in the middle of the night. &ldquo;I thought they were going to take my kids.&rdquo;</aside>\n<p>Changing the way a massive bureaucracy has done business for decades is no small task. Success relies not simply on new, more benevolent programs like GABI, but also on convincing ACS&rsquo;s community partners&mdash;the private groups contracted to provide foster care and preventive services&mdash;to embrace a new mission. It means convincing the holders of city and state purse strings&mdash;the ACS budget is $2.7 billion for 2019&mdash;to invest in experimental programs whose success won&rsquo;t be calculable for years, and whose failures will be <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/12/22/acs-on-the-hook-for-deaths-of-10-at-risk-kids-in-3-months-probe/\">splashed across the media</a>, potentially costing government officials <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/12/acs-commissioner-gladys-carrion-resigns-107990\">their jobs</a>. Above all, it entails convincing families who, for generations, have viewed ACS as a threat, to give it another chance.</p>\n<p>If successful, though, ACS could create a more benevolent model for child welfare that would be followed in other cities and states. ACS, which conducts more than 60,000 investigations of families each year, is one of the largest child welfare agencies in the country&mdash;dwarfing many other states&rsquo; agencies entirely. Its size alone guarantees that whatever happens here becomes a national model. &ldquo;Everyone in child welfare agrees that what&rsquo;s going on in New York City is relevant to the work happening elsewhere in the country,&rdquo; said Guggenheim. Instead of a government bureaucracy that is widely perceived as punitive and biased against the poor, ACS could transform itself into the type of agency that it wants to be: a resource families can turn to in times of trouble.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something to be said for why ACS partnered with us,&rdquo; Murphy said to the mothers at the St. George GABI center. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to operate out of fear, and they really want to be here to support people.&rdquo; The women nodded, considering the idea. Finally, one of them spoke, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying they want to change?&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/5a71ab2e7747588043019992d5485ac0caafac97.jpeg?w=800&q=65&dpi=1&fm=pjpg&h=1195\"></img><figcaption>In January, Jennifer McClure photographed families at the GABI center in Staten Island. She then gave the parents and children art materials and invited them to draw on and decorate the images.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For more than 150 years, child welfare policies have swung back and forth between two polarized notions of how best to serve vulnerable children: Should they be removed from troubled homes, or should their families be helped? Should &ldquo;child protection&rdquo; be the guiding principle, or &ldquo;family preservation&rdquo;? Where society lands on these issues has always depended on prevailing attitudes toward poverty. Reformers have long argued that taking children from poor families does nothing to address the root problem of poverty. In June, for example, Democratic Representative Gwen Moore of Wisconsin, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus who, as an 18-year-old college student, <a href=\"https://gwenmoore.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1921\">was temporarily forced </a>to relinquish her own child to relative foster care, introduced the Family Poverty Is Not Neglect Act, which stipulates that children can&rsquo;t be removed from families solely on the basis of poverty-related issues. &ldquo;I went through the system, and was humiliated, and mistreated,&rdquo; Moore said in a 2017 interview. &ldquo;I see that there is a deliberate effort to destroy these families.&rdquo; Moreover, children who are placed in chronically overtaxed foster care programs experience long-lasting trauma and, as <a href=\"https://endhomelessness.org/foster-kids-and-homelessness-what-are-the-risk-factors/\">studies have shown</a>, far higher risk of teen pregnancy, incarceration, unemployment, and homelessness, compared to children who are left in families with similar problems. Conservative critics, however, have essentially argued&mdash;particularly during America&rsquo;s periodic drives to crack down on welfare&mdash;that parents who can&rsquo;t support their families are, by definition, unfit.</p>\n<aside>For decades, child welfare policies have swung between two competing notions: Should kids be removed from troubled homes, or should their families be helped?</aside>\n<p>From the mid-1800s through 1929, New York City and other Eastern cities arrived at a draconian solution, shipping as many as 250,000 children from impoverished tenement families West to the expanding U.S. frontier. Children <a href=\"https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/programs/child-welfarechild-labor/orphan-trains/\">placed on &ldquo;orphan trains&rdquo;</a> were offered for adoption at depot stops and churches along the way. (To modern eyes, many of those adoptions more closely resembled indentured servitude.) Then, in the 1910s, the pendulum swung the other way, as a movement arose to supply pensions to &ldquo;deserving&rdquo; single mothers, particularly widows, so they could safely raise their children at home. (What minimal help that was offered, though, was restricted almost entirely to white mothers, as were the New Deal&rsquo;s welfare provisions two decades later.)</p>\n<p>In the 1960s, things changed again, when the concept of child abuse was &ldquo;rediscovered&rdquo; by a group of doctors that included C. Henry Kempe, a pediatrician who <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/327895\">coined the term</a> &ldquo;battered child syndrome.&rdquo; Kempe&rsquo;s label&mdash;which he described as deliberately &ldquo;provocative and anger-producing&rdquo;&mdash;helped lead to the establishment of mandatory child abuse reporting laws across the country. The idea was widely embraced, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/12854/the-lost-children-of-wilder-by-nina-bernstein/9780679758341/\">notes journalist Nina Bernstein</a> in <em>The Lost Children of Wilder</em>, her account of the legal battle to reform New York City foster care, because casting child abuse as a &ldquo;classless&rdquo; phenomenon&mdash;no more endemic to the poor than the rich&mdash;allowed politicians to isolate child welfare spending from the larger anti-poverty programs of the Great Society, which were by then already losing support.</p>\n<p>But the focus on child abuse, which might seem a positive, child-oriented development, resulted in demonizing parents&mdash;most often parents of color&mdash;whose children suffered because of the environments they were born into. &ldquo;What was understood by some advocates as a social problem rooted in poverty and other social inequalities became widely interpreted as a symptom of individual parents&rsquo; mental depravity,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/dorothy-roberts/shattered-bonds/9780465070596/\">notes social critic Dorothy Roberts</a> in her book <em>Shattered Bonds: The Color of Child Welfare</em>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never been a classless problem, and it certainly is not today,&rdquo; said Gottlieb. &ldquo;If legislators say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to pour these billions into supporting poor families,&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t go anywhere. If we say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to protect children from abusive parents&rsquo;&mdash;if we label a demon&mdash;then the money can follow that.&rdquo; In the child welfare system today, she said, &ldquo;everything we do for families is set up around the idea that &lsquo;We have to protect our children from <em>you.</em>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the 1970s, the class-action lawsuit <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>Bernstein</em> <a href=\"http://movies2.nytimes.com/books/01/03/25/reviews/010325.25luhrmat.html\">took aim at racial discrimination</a> within the private agencies that handled New York City&rsquo;s foster care with taxpayer support, but which systematically excluded black children. Black children at the time were relegated to harsh, decrepit juvenile reformatories, in which, in some cases, more than 80 percent of the kids hadn&rsquo;t committed crimes but were simply would-be foster children. The racial disparity was so stark, Nina Bernstein notes, that the superintendent of one facility called it &ldquo;a plantation.&rdquo; By the time <em>Wilder</em> was settled in 1986, almost 15 years after it began, the city&rsquo;s foster care system was starting to explode amid the aids and crack epidemics. By the early 1990s, there were nearly 50,000 children in the system&mdash;almost all of whom were black.</p>\n<p>Politics at the national level only made matters worse, as the political establishment turned against welfare and began to argue explicitly that parents who needed support to raise their children had no business keeping them. In 1994, <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/that-time-newt-gingrich-tried-to-take-kids-away-from-welfare-recipients-and-put-them-in-orphanages-261e525ea22e/\">Newt Gingrich put it</a> most bluntly: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help you with foster care, we&rsquo;ll help you with orphanages, we&rsquo;ll help you with adoption&rdquo;&mdash;but not, as Bernstein noted, with money for family preservation, a position that was echoed in the Contract With America that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/jfnpr/jfreview.htm\">Gingrich proposed</a> later that year. By 1997, when Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, establishing a tight timetable for terminating parental rights and offering foster children for adoption, the campaign against keeping families together had become so forceful that one magazine headline read, &ldquo;family preservation&mdash;it can kill.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The force of the pendulum swing between child protection and family preservation is often driven by high-profile tragedies. In New York in 1995, Elisa Izquierdo, a six-year-old girl from Brooklyn, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/27/nyregion/mother-s-tale-drugs-despair-violence-life-mired-urban-ills-ends-daughter-s-death.html\">was brutally beaten</a> to death by her mother after repeated reports of abuse from neighbors and Izquierdo&rsquo;s school went unheeded by the city&rsquo;s Child Welfare Administration and other city and state agencies. The case became a national scandal. <em>Time </em>magazine <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19951211,00.html\">published a haunting photo</a> of the girl on its cover, under the title, &ldquo;a shameful death: let down by the system, murdered by her mom, a little girl symbolizes america&rsquo;s failure to protect its children.&rdquo; The Child Welfare Administration was abolished, and <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/acs/about/Events/2016/milestones/twenty.page\">ACS was created</a> in its stead.</p>\n<p>Izquierdo&rsquo;s death sparked what has become <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/12/16/1611491/-Once-again-New-York-City-children-pay-the-price-of-foster-care-panic\">a familiar pattern</a> of overcorrection, common in the aftermath of such tragedies, in which child welfare officials ramp up family separations, in an effort to avoid another catastrophic &ldquo;miss.&rdquo; Through the mid-&rsquo;90s, notes a recent report by the Center for New York City Affairs, a policy research institute at the New School, the ACS caseworkers&rsquo; union even counseled its members with the grim slogan, &ldquo;When in doubt, pull &rsquo;em out.&rdquo; And they did: In the three years following Izquierdo&rsquo;s death, the number of children taken into ACS custody increased by 50 percent.</p>\n<p>Family preservation advocates like the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform <a href=\"https://www.nccprblog.org/2018/07/one-element-of-nyc-foster-care-panic.html\">call this</a> a &ldquo;foster care panic.&rdquo; It is hardly unique to New York. In the two years following the 1993 murder of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/26/us/mother-sentenced-to-life-in-a-killing-that-shook-chicago.html\">a toddler in Illinois</a>, the state&rsquo;s foster care system grew by 44 percent, rendering Illinois children more likely to end up in state custody than anywhere else in the United States.</p>\n<p>But the need to intervene more is the wrong lesson to take from tragedy. &ldquo;Children fall through the cracks not because child welfare agencies are devoting too much to family preservation,&rdquo; Dorothy Roberts writes, but &ldquo;because agencies are devoting too much to child removal.&rdquo; When there are too many children in foster care, she argues, there are neither enough foster homes to care for them, nor enough caseworkers with adequate time to identify those children who are truly at risk. Indeed, NCCPR notes, three years after the foster care panic began in Illinois, child deaths in the state had increased by 17 percent. Moreover, the focus on child protection creates perverse incentives for caseworkers and welfare agencies. &ldquo;There has never been a preventive services worker in the history of child welfare who has ever been penalized for not helping a family enough,&rdquo; said Gottlieb. &ldquo;But they are penalized all the time for not doing enough to protect the kid.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In 2016, a similar panic <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2016/12/06/acs_removal_rate_rise.php\">flared again</a>, following the deaths in New York of two children whom ACS had left in their homes. That September, a six-year-old boy from Harlem named Zymere Perkins <a href=\"https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161020/central-harlem/zymere-perkins-cause-of-death-medical-examiner\">was allegedly beaten</a> to death by his mother&rsquo;s boyfriend just weeks after an ACS caseworker closed his case. Two months later, three-year-old Jaden Jordan of Gravesend, Brooklyn, died. ACS had received an anonymous report that the boy was being kept in a dog crate, but for two days, caseworkers couldn&rsquo;t locate him, because they had been given the wrong address, and staff didn&rsquo;t know how to find the correct one in their system. Like Perkins, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/nyregion/brooklyn-toddler-injured-in-suspected-abuse-has-died.html?_r=0&module=inline\">Jordan was allegedly</a> beaten to death by his mother&rsquo;s boyfriend.</p>\n<p>The ensuing public outcry was tremendous. &ldquo;How ACS Failed Him,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2016/12/14/the-gruesome-details-of-zymere-perkins-abuse-and-how-acs-failed-him/\">read the headline</a> of a <em>New York Post</em> article detailing the abuse Perkins suffered. The city&rsquo;s other tabloid, the <em>Daily News</em>, lambasted Perkins&rsquo;s caseworker with a cover story that declared, &ldquo;she let him die to get promoted.&rdquo; Then&ndash;ACS Commissioner Gladys Carri&oacute;n, a reformer who had focused on preventive services intended to keep children out of foster care, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/nyregion/new-york-citys-child-welfare-commissioner-gladys-carrion-resigns.html\">resigned</a> under pressure.</p>\n<p>Since then, ACS has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/nyregion/how-new-yorks-child-welfare-chief-is-trying-to-fix-his-agencys-image.html\">eager to repair</a> its image. In June, it launched a public relations campaign featuring videos and subway ads with children and parents who&rsquo;d been involved with the system declaring, &ldquo;ACS fought for my family.&rdquo; In June, the agency unveiled a &ldquo;CPS appreciation week,&rdquo; to honor New York City&rsquo;s child protective specialists, its &ldquo;first responders&rdquo; for children. And its new commissioner, David Hansell, who succeeded Carri&oacute;n in February 2017, has <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/10/02/david-hansell-is-ready-to-take-on-the-citys-embattled-acs/\">been courting the media</a> in an effort to improve public perception of the agency.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a couple of terrible tragedies,&rdquo; Hansell told me, &ldquo;and the dynamic we&rsquo;ve seen over and over again&mdash;not just in New York City but across the country&mdash;is that a terrible tragedy happens, it gets a lot of attention in the public, there are investigations, and so on. It leads the child welfare agency to be reactive and defensive and to be more draconian.&rdquo; He vowed to address this cycle by focusing on the root causes that underlie tragedies like child deaths, rather than seeking individuals or communities to blame.</p>\n<p>Yet from 2016 to 2017, the number of children placed in foster care in the city <a href=\"https://www.nccprblog.org/2017/09/yes-nyc-there-is-foster-care-panic.html\">increased 13 percent</a>. Hansell attributed the increase not to caseworker reactiveness but to a rise in public reporting&mdash;up 7 percent since 2016. However, in the year and a half following Perkins&rsquo;s death, ACS has also presided over a 54 percent increase in the number of cases it brought to family court, and a roughly 30 percent increase in emergency removals&mdash;when ACS takes a child from parents before even seeing a judge. As a result, warned a July report from the Center for New York City Affairs, ACS staff caseloads have increased, families have been put on months-long waiting lists to receive preventive services, and family courts have been so swamped with cases that attorneys say it&rsquo;s led to &ldquo;a new level of dysfunction,&rdquo; with delays and deferrals &ldquo;that impact every family in the system.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I got a sense of this when I visited the Bronx Family Court, an imposing brutalist structure not far from Yankee Stadium. In June, in a windowless waiting room on the seventh floor, I watched a distraught young mother&mdash;African American, like almost everyone else there&mdash;approach the court clerk and two white lawyers who were complaining about the bad courthouse Wi-Fi and their children&rsquo;s college grades.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; she asked. Her court- appointed attorney had left New York without anyone telling her, and her new lawyer hadn&rsquo;t shown up. &ldquo;I come every time [ACS] sets court appointments, and they never show,&rdquo; she said. The clerk apologized, then looked to one of the attorneys, who was there representing ACS: Maybe he should talk to the agency about why the mother&rsquo;s caseworker hadn&rsquo;t been in touch. The mother walked back to a wooden bench, where a young boy and an adult man waited silently. &ldquo;This happens every day,&rdquo; she said, angry to the point of tears.</p>\n<p>Inside one of the courtrooms, another African American woman, middle-aged, with braids pulled into a side bun, sat at the center of a U-shaped table, listening as her public defender explained that she&rsquo;d been accepted to an in-patient substance abuse program that allows parents to keep their children with them. A court-appointed guardian, there to represent the woman&rsquo;s young daughter, objected, saying it was too soon to place the child back in the mother&rsquo;s custody, and that the city should wait to see if she could stay sober. An ACS attorney concurred, arguing that the mother should only be allowed to see her daughter before entering rehab if she passed a drug test that day. The judge agreed to both requests, then asked the lawyers about their vacation plans before setting a date to reconvene in a month. The mother, whom no one had addressed directly, started to cry.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/87d5f090b2fae924b34061f6c31fe074041edfb1.jpeg?w=1400&q=65&dpi=1&fm=pjpg&h=940\"></img></figure>\n<p>In Highbridge, a poor, predominantly African American and Latino neighborhood not far from the Bronx Family Court, a new program called Circle of Dreams opened in April. It is one of three Family Enrichment Centers that ACS is testing as part of its reform effort. Funded by ACS but operated by existing community nonprofits, the FECs are open to parents and nonparents, teenagers, and seniors alike, and can include food pantries, r&eacute;sum&eacute; workshops, parenting groups, art classes, or just hang-out spots. Circle of Dreams is managed by Bridge Builders, a local group that focuses on family preservation. ACS is providing $450,000 in annual funding for the next three years.</p>\n<p>From the street, you could easily miss the entrance: a side door to the basement of a large prewar high-rise. Inside, however, the stairs lead to a series of bright rooms that seem to open endlessly onto one another. Chairs are clustered around a flat-screen TV streaming an image of a flickering log fire. There&rsquo;s a table with orange juice and sweet rolls. An alleyway covered in paver stones leads to a patio with a child&rsquo;s basketball hoop, a porch swing, and ivy-covered walls. There&rsquo;s a playroom, computer stations, a dining area with flowers on the tables, and a den in the back, where, on the day I visited, women had rolled back the carpet to host an impromptu Zumba class.</p>\n<p>The center&rsquo;s programming is driven by client demand&mdash;asking people what they need, and also what existing strengths the center can tap into. (In Highbridge, the almost ponderously deliberate practice of soliciting community feedback meant that some of the center&rsquo;s brightly painted walls were still bare in June; the process of polling the community on what art they wanted hadn&rsquo;t yet concluded.) In its first month of operation, the center hosted a &ldquo;parent caf&eacute;&rdquo; in the dining room, gathering parents from widely different backgrounds for food and guided discussion on topics like how to help your children talk to you. Unlike the GABI centers, which are focused on parents with open ACS cases, the goal of the FECs is to strengthen the community and reduce the need for ACS interventions. &ldquo;Parents are isolated,&rdquo; said Alida Camacho, Circle of Dreams&rsquo; director. &ldquo;If you talk with most families who have cases of neglect, you&rsquo;re going to find that they&rsquo;re decent parents, that in a lot of areas they do have good parenting skills. But there are some areas where they don&rsquo;t.&hellip; In centers like this, we&rsquo;re hoping that we&rsquo;re going to hear it firsthand before something becomes an issue.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Since the 1990s, when New York City placed almost 50,000 children into foster homes&mdash;10 percent of the country&rsquo;s entire foster care population&mdash;its child welfare agency has reduced the number of child removals significantly. Today, approximately 9,000 children are in New York City&rsquo;s foster care system&mdash;<a href=\"https://childwelfaremonitor.org/2018/01/02/whats-behind-the-drop-in-new-york-city-foster-care-numbers-more-than-the-commissioner-chooses-to-say/\">a sharp decline</a> that is due, at least in part, to the aid that ACS&rsquo;s existing prevention programs provide. Yet ACS&rsquo;s successes have been tempered by the fact that, because many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/01/new-york-city-foster-care-children-parents\">poor parents view</a> ACS as inherently dangerous, they routinely walk away from the programs that are designed to support them, rather than invite child welfare into their lives. &ldquo;So many people are scared that reaching out for help can mean ACS involvement,&rdquo; said Rise&rsquo;s Jeanette Vega. &ldquo;So they don&rsquo;t reach out, they stay in their homes, and they don&rsquo;t get help for their problems.&rdquo; The distrust and fear that poor parents feel are roadblocks that ACS must overcome. &ldquo;No child welfare system is going to work well when parents run away from the help that they&rsquo;re being offered,&rdquo; Martin Guggenheim said.</p>\n<p>Given their experimental nature, Circle of Dreams and the other FECs are still figuring out how to define success. For now, they are mostly collecting anecdotes: a mother who came in looking for assistance with an electric bill and left with money management mentoring and a prom dress for her daughter; the teenagers who enjoy free pizza after school; the women dancing in the next room. The benefits, to a certain extent, are intangible. &ldquo;We can count numbers,&rdquo; said Crystal Young-Scott, director of ACS&rsquo;s FEC program. &ldquo;But what does that Zumba mean to these women?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The most important aspect of the centers, however, may be the fact that people can use them with a large degree of confidentiality. At Circle of Dreams, there&rsquo;s no intake process, no tracking database, no case management services where ACS checks in on parents. Employees are still mandated child abuse reporters, required by law to call the child abuse hotline if they suspect that a child is being mistreated. But an explicit goal of the center is to dispel the notion that asking for help automatically triggers ACS involvement. &ldquo;Everyone is so used to when you receive services, someone&rsquo;s going to open a case record,&rdquo; Camacho said. At Circle of Dreams, however, &ldquo;when people come in, you don&rsquo;t have to sign in if you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Kailey Burger, ACS&rsquo;s assistant commissioner for Community Based Strategies&mdash;a new division within ACS&rsquo;s prevention division&mdash;worked as a lawyer in the Bronx Family Court in 2014, handling juvenile justice cases, before coming to believe that courts weren&rsquo;t the solution. &ldquo;By the time the kids are in those systems, so many other systems have failed,&rdquo; she said. She decided to move &ldquo;upstream,&rdquo; to ACS, with the hopes that the child welfare agency could fix its poisoned relationship with poor communities of color and allow families to feel comfortable enough to ask for help before things reached a crisis point. In 2016, Burger partnered with Dr. Jacqueline Martin, the deputy commissioner of ACS&rsquo;s prevention division, to pursue initiatives like the GABI program and the FECs. The goal, Burger said, was to help families &ldquo;in a way that they retain dignity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Through these pilot programs, Martin and Burger have been rethinking the role of ACS. &ldquo;What if families could really pursue their potential? What would they need to do that?&rdquo; said Martin. &ldquo;What if race and ethnicity didn&rsquo;t matter? What kind of child welfare system would we need?&rdquo; And more than anything else, they believe that ultimate success depends on ACS overcoming its toxic history with the families it wishes to serve. &ldquo;We want this to be a new way of work,&rdquo; said Burger. &ldquo;Not working on or for a family, but partnering with them for as long as they want. And then we&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Reformers who have spent years fighting for parents condemned by the system are still cautiously optimistic. ACS&rsquo;s new initiatives are only pilot programs, and they involve a fraction of the families that the agency works with each year. And if ACS&rsquo;s goal is to reduce its presence in parents&rsquo; lives, statistics suggest that the opposite is true. From 2005 to 2017, the number of cases ACS has substantiated annually has grown from 33 percent to 40 percent. And the number of families ACS has placed under court-ordered supervision has increased from 1,947 to 7,490 per year over that same period. &ldquo;The presence of ACS in neighborhoods is higher, and that&rsquo;s a bad change,&rdquo; said Nora McCarthy, the director of Rise. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re really committed to changing dynamics, they need to change the dynamics in which they&rsquo;re hauling so many families into court.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;On paper, ACS&rsquo;s heart is in the right place,&rdquo; said Ginelle Stephenson, a social work supervisor at the Center for Family Representation, which provides lawyers to parents with ACS cases in Manhattan and Queens. But the new approach doesn&rsquo;t seem to be trickling down to the ACS rank and file. In meetings with caseworkers at foster care agencies, she said, well-intentioned bromides about not blaming or shaming parents tend to be forgotten by ACS workers loading up case plans with more services than parents can manage. &ldquo;A lot of what we do is say, &lsquo;She doesn&rsquo;t need that right now,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Stephenson. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s supposedly voluntary, but there&rsquo;s a lot of undertone that, &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll be watching.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And there&rsquo;s still a concern that, despite their stated goals, the new pilot programs could become avenues for more ACS involvement in families&rsquo; lives, rather than less. &ldquo;A really key test of whether there&rsquo;s a shift is when families go into FECs and see what&rsquo;s offered, how often is there going to be a report called in to a hotline,&rdquo; said Chris Gottlieb. &ldquo;I hope these will be helpful enough that they will outweigh that risk, but the more the staff sees themselves as monitors of the poor community, the less helpful it will be.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Burger said she understands the skepticism, given the way ACS has traditionally worked with poor communities, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/nyregion/foster-care-nyc-jane-crow.html\">the footprint</a> its other divisions still have. &ldquo;Every time I go out and say I work for ACS, people say this is pie in the sky,&rdquo; she said. But she hopes the new programs will demonstrate ACS&rsquo;s commitment to a new way of doing things. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on us to continue keeping our word.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The pilot programs may be small in scope, but they could have a far-reaching impact on the child welfare landscape. Over the next year and a half, most of ACS&rsquo;s existing contracts for foster care and prevention programs will expire, providing the agency with an opportunity to implement its reform agenda on a wider scale. The programs that ACS works with going forward will determine the values and direction of the agency for at least the next decade. To Martin and Burger, it&rsquo;s a chance to create a more socially just child welfare system.</p>\n<p>The ultimate challenge, though, may not be whether ACS can develop more supportive programs&mdash;or even whether it can get poor families to trust the agency again. It&rsquo;s whether society as a whole can stop criminalizing poverty and embrace the idea that poor families are worthy of compassion. Even the best preventive services will flounder if they continue to be surrounded by a broader landscape in which caseworkers, investigators, attorneys, and family court judges <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/07/when-should-a-child-be-taken-from-his-parents\">treat poor parents as criminals</a>. Even the most generous of programs cannot make up for government policies that force poor children to live in unsafe housing, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/147066/flints-water-crisis-damage-kids-brains\">drink </a>lead-poisoned water, and go without adequate health care and education. &ldquo;The whole existence of ACS lets us pretend that we&rsquo;re protecting children,&rdquo; said Emma Ketteringham, the managing director of family defense at the Bronx Defenders, a legal nonprofit that represents parents with ACS cases. &ldquo;But if child protection was at the center of our priorities, that would require the government to rethink its relationship vis-&agrave;-vis children.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On the whole, however, government policy continues to adhere to the Social Darwinist conviction that the wealthy are most deserving because they are wealthy, and the only reason poor people are poor is because of some personal flaw. The overarching narrative, Martin Guggenheim said, is that &ldquo;the only thing wrong with poor children is their parents.&rdquo; Overcoming that ideology will require us as a society to confront a harsh reality. &ldquo;The truth about what&rsquo;s wrong with poor children,&rdquo; Guggenheim said, &ldquo;is they were born in America, in a system that doesn&rsquo;t care about them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><i>This article was written with support from the &ldquo;Reporting Vulnerable Children in Care&rdquo; program, a journalism skills development program run by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in partnership with UBS&rsquo;s Optimus Foundation.</i></p>",

                "text": "One morning in May, on the fifth floor of an office building in the St. George neighborhood of Staten Island, New York, five mothers and seven small children sat in a circle, singing a song to the tune of \u201cFr\u00e8re Jacques.\u201d One by one, in Spanish and English, they made their way around the room, repeating each phrase sung by a gregarious developmental pediatrician: \u201cWhere is mom? There she is. How are you today, friend? Play with us.\u201d\nThe room was sunny, with views of New York Harbor and the soaring spans of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. The walls were painted a reassuring pastel yellow, and it was decorated with plush, child-size armchairs and padded floor mats. Behind a toddler-scaled wooden table, baskets woven from rainbow-dyed yarn overflowed with soft toys. Once they finished singing, the children were let loose to explore, alongside their mothers and several clinicians, who sat on the floor beside them, speaking little but encouraging everyone to play.\nAfter an hour, the mothers left the children and went next door, to a room with adult-size chairs, for an hour of grown-up talk with Dr. Anne Murphy, a psychologist and founder of the Group Attachment Based Intervention (GABI) program. Three days a week, families with children up to three years old come to GABI centers in St. George and six other New York City neighborhoods for two-hour drop-in sessions, during which parents\u2014low-income, often socially isolated parents\u2014can meet in a welcoming, nonjudgmental environment.\nThe GABI centers are designed to be high-end experiences, with inviting rooms, upscale furniture, and the sort of \u201cMommy and Me\u201d vibe you might find in the more affluent parts of Brooklyn or Manhattan. Staff members put together videos documenting the progress the children make, note how the mothers take their coffee, and even on occasion call them in the evenings to check in, if they know they\u2019ve had a stressful day. They are the sort of places you\u2019d want to bring your kid, if you had the money to spend.\nThe mothers in Staten Island were largely not at the GABI center out of choice, but because they had to be; most, if not all, had open prevention cases with the Administration for Children\u2019s Services (ACS), New York City\u2019s child welfare agency.\nMurphy founded the first GABI center at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx in 2010. In 2017, ACS partnered with her to expand the program and open centers in every borough, in areas with frequent reports of child abuse or neglect\u2014terms that can encompass a wide range of circumstances, from bruising and other visible signs of mistreatment to things like frequent absence from school, excessive fatigue or hunger, or simply walking home alone. Many calls to the city\u2019s child abuse hotline come from teachers and hospital staff, who are required by law to report signs of abuse or neglect. In Staten Island, most of the reports come from St. George and neighboring Stapleton.\nThe goal of the GABI program is to provide support to parents and keep problems from escalating to the point where children need to be removed from their homes and placed in foster care. It is guided by the fact that, while serious child abuse does occur, it\u2019s rare, and many issues that fall under the broad umbrella of \u201cneglect\u201d\u2014which alone accounts for 73 percent of all allegations of child maltreatment made to ACS\u2014are simply the everyday struggles of low-income families. In New York, the ten neighborhoods with the highest number of ACS cases, mostly in the Bronx, also represent the lowest incomes, highest unemployment, and greatest income-to-rent disparities in the city. Eight of those neighborhoods are the top places from which families enter homeless shelters. They\u2019re also neighborhoods inhabited predominantly by people of color. \u201cIt\u2019s not neglect,\u201d said Jeanette Vega, the training director at Rise, a New York nonprofit that advocates for parents with open ACS cases. \u201cWe\u2019re poor\u2014this is poverty.\u201d\nThis recognition that poor parents need help, not suspicion and condemnation, represents a substantial departure from the understanding many families have of ACS. All too often, family defense advocates say, ACS caseworkers visit families in the middle of the night\u2014a tactic that is supposed to be reserved for emergencies in which children are in imminent danger\u2014demanding that parents wake their children so they can inspect their bodies for bruises, interview them alone, check their bedrooms, and take stock of the food in the kitchen cupboards. Preventive services like parenting classes or counseling sessions for mental health, substance abuse, or domestic violence\u2014technically voluntary, but refused at parents\u2019 risk\u2014are often preventive in name only and do little to address at-risk families\u2019 greatest needs, only increasing the burdens on parents who are already stretched thin, making it more likely that they will be forced to relinquish their children to foster care. \u201cWith some cases, I almost struggle to use the word \u2018services,\u2019 because I think most families wouldn\u2019t describe them as services,\u201d said Chris Gottlieb, the co-director of the Family Defense Clinic at the New York University School of Law. \u201cPeople call me all the time, saying, \u2018I reached out to ACS for help, and it destroyed my family.\u2019\u201d\nAt the GABI center in St. George, one woman with a quiet voice and long, dark hair described her terror when ACS banged on her door in the middle of the night, demanding to speak to her children. \u201cI was so scared,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought they were going to take my kids.\u201d Another mother nodded her agreement. \u201cThey want to put you in that state of fear,\u201d she said. A third spoke of how she\u2019d been taken from her own mother at age eleven, separated from her younger brother, and shuffled through nine foster and group homes, some of which were abusive. She emerged traumatized and struggled to rekindle her relationships with her siblings. And now, as a parent, she said ACS continued to hound her, showing up at her door or at her daughters\u2019 school in response to what she said were false reports of domestic violence, waiting for her to slip up. \u201cFor people like me, who\u2019ve been in the system,\u201d she said, \u201cACS is a place I hate.\u201d\nThe women viewed the GABI program differently, however. At the center in St. George, they felt respected, even loved. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of ACS,\u201d said one mother, \u201cbut then you think, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to the GABI program. It\u2019s completely different.\u2019\u201d The GABI initiative, along with several other pilot programs in New York, are part of a major effort by ACS to counteract its image as a \u201cbaby-snatching\u201d police force riddled with the same racial and economic biases that beset actual law enforcement in the United States. Together, the programs amount to an experiment: to see whether one of the largest child welfare agencies in the country can change the dynamics that have poisoned its relationship with the vulnerable families it seeks to serve and must oversee. It\u2019s a sort of idealistic gamble, deeply informed by critics who charge that child welfare agencies like ACS unfairly target the poor and the nonwhite, and treat all family crises with the hammer of child removal.\n\u201cIt used to be in the Bronx projects that all you had to do was shout, \u2018There\u2019s a cop in the hall,\u2019 and people would flee,\u201d said Martin Guggenheim, a law professor at NYU and a national expert on child welfare. \u201cNow you say, \u2018ACS is on the ground,\u2019 and people flee. That\u2019s one of the saddest parts: This is a helping agency, meant to support poor families, and the parents are terrified of the very agency whose charge is to support them.\u201d\n\u201cI was so scared,\u201d one woman said, describing her terror when ACS banged on her door in the middle of the night. \u201cI thought they were going to take my kids.\u201d\nChanging the way a massive bureaucracy has done business for decades is no small task. Success relies not simply on new, more benevolent programs like GABI, but also on convincing ACS\u2019s community partners\u2014the private groups contracted to provide foster care and preventive services\u2014to embrace a new mission. It means convincing the holders of city and state purse strings\u2014the ACS budget is $2.7 billion for 2019\u2014to invest in experimental programs whose success won\u2019t be calculable for years, and whose failures will be splashed across the media, potentially costing government officials their jobs. Above all, it entails convincing families who, for generations, have viewed ACS as a threat, to give it another chance.\nIf successful, though, ACS could create a more benevolent model for child welfare that would be followed in other cities and states. ACS, which conducts more than 60,000 investigations of families each year, is one of the largest child welfare agencies in the country\u2014dwarfing many other states\u2019 agencies entirely. Its size alone guarantees that whatever happens here becomes a national model. \u201cEveryone in child welfare agrees that what\u2019s going on in New York City is relevant to the work happening elsewhere in the country,\u201d said Guggenheim. Instead of a government bureaucracy that is widely perceived as punitive and biased against the poor, ACS could transform itself into the type of agency that it wants to be: a resource families can turn to in times of trouble.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something to be said for why ACS partnered with us,\u201d Murphy said to the mothers at the St. George GABI center. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to operate out of fear, and they really want to be here to support people.\u201d The women nodded, considering the idea. Finally, one of them spoke, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying they want to change?\u201d\nFor more than 150 years, child welfare policies have swung back and forth between two polarized notions of how best to serve vulnerable children: Should they be removed from troubled homes, or should their families be helped? Should \u201cchild protection\u201d be the guiding principle, or \u201cfamily preservation\u201d? Where society lands on these issues has always depended on prevailing attitudes toward poverty. Reformers have long argued that taking children from poor families does nothing to address the root problem of poverty. In June, for example, Democratic Representative Gwen Moore of Wisconsin, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus who, as an 18-year-old college student, was temporarily forced to relinquish her own child to relative foster care, introduced the Family Poverty Is Not Neglect Act, which stipulates that children can\u2019t be removed from families solely on the basis of poverty-related issues. \u201cI went through the system, and was humiliated, and mistreated,\u201d Moore said in a 2017 interview. \u201cI see that there is a deliberate effort to destroy these families.\u201d Moreover, children who are placed in chronically overtaxed foster care programs experience long-lasting trauma and, as studies have shown, far higher risk of teen pregnancy, incarceration, unemployment, and homelessness, compared to children who are left in families with similar problems. Conservative critics, however, have essentially argued\u2014particularly during America\u2019s periodic drives to crack down on welfare\u2014that parents who can\u2019t support their families are, by definition, unfit.\nFor decades, child welfare policies have swung between two competing notions: Should kids be removed from troubled homes, or should their families be helped?\nFrom the mid-1800s through 1929, New York City and other Eastern cities arrived at a draconian solution, shipping as many as 250,000 children from impoverished tenement families West to the expanding U.S. frontier. Children placed on \u201corphan trains\u201d were offered for adoption at depot stops and churches along the way. (To modern eyes, many of those adoptions more closely resembled indentured servitude.) Then, in the 1910s, the pendulum swung the other way, as a movement arose to supply pensions to \u201cdeserving\u201d single mothers, particularly widows, so they could safely raise their children at home. (What minimal help that was offered, though, was restricted almost entirely to white mothers, as were the New Deal\u2019s welfare provisions two decades later.)\nIn the 1960s, things changed again, when the concept of child abuse was \u201crediscovered\u201d by a group of doctors that included C. Henry Kempe, a pediatrician who coined the term \u201cbattered child syndrome.\u201d Kempe\u2019s label\u2014which he described as deliberately \u201cprovocative and anger-producing\u201d\u2014helped lead to the establishment of mandatory child abuse reporting laws across the country. The idea was widely embraced, notes journalist Nina Bernstein in The Lost Children of Wilder, her account of the legal battle to reform New York City foster care, because casting child abuse as a \u201cclassless\u201d phenomenon\u2014no more endemic to the poor than the rich\u2014allowed politicians to isolate child welfare spending from the larger anti-poverty programs of the Great Society, which were by then already losing support.\nBut the focus on child abuse, which might seem a positive, child-oriented development, resulted in demonizing parents\u2014most often parents of color\u2014whose children suffered because of the environments they were born into. \u201cWhat was understood by some advocates as a social problem rooted in poverty and other social inequalities became widely interpreted as a symptom of individual parents\u2019 mental depravity,\u201d notes social critic Dorothy Roberts in her book Shattered Bonds: The Color of Child Welfare.\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been a classless problem, and it certainly is not today,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cIf legislators say, \u2018We\u2019re going to pour these billions into supporting poor families,\u2019 it won\u2019t go anywhere. If we say, \u2018We\u2019re going to protect children from abusive parents\u2019\u2014if we label a demon\u2014then the money can follow that.\u201d In the child welfare system today, she said, \u201ceverything we do for families is set up around the idea that \u2018We have to protect our children from you.\u2019\u201d\nIn the 1970s, the class-action lawsuit Wilder v. Bernstein took aim at racial discrimination within the private agencies that handled New York City\u2019s foster care with taxpayer support, but which systematically excluded black children. Black children at the time were relegated to harsh, decrepit juvenile reformatories, in which, in some cases, more than 80 percent of the kids hadn\u2019t committed crimes but were simply would-be foster children. The racial disparity was so stark, Nina Bernstein notes, that the superintendent of one facility called it \u201ca plantation.\u201d By the time Wilder was settled in 1986, almost 15 years after it began, the city\u2019s foster care system was starting to explode amid the aids and crack epidemics. By the early 1990s, there were nearly 50,000 children in the system\u2014almost all of whom were black.\nPolitics at the national level only made matters worse, as the political establishment turned against welfare and began to argue explicitly that parents who needed support to raise their children had no business keeping them. In 1994, Newt Gingrich put it most bluntly: \u201cWe\u2019ll help you with foster care, we\u2019ll help you with orphanages, we\u2019ll help you with adoption\u201d\u2014but not, as Bernstein noted, with money for family preservation, a position that was echoed in the Contract With America that Gingrich proposed later that year. By 1997, when Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, establishing a tight timetable for terminating parental rights and offering foster children for adoption, the campaign against keeping families together had become so forceful that one magazine headline read, \u201cfamily preservation\u2014it can kill.\u201d\nThe force of the pendulum swing between child protection and family preservation is often driven by high-profile tragedies. In New York in 1995, Elisa Izquierdo, a six-year-old girl from Brooklyn, was brutally beaten to death by her mother after repeated reports of abuse from neighbors and Izquierdo\u2019s school went unheeded by the city\u2019s Child Welfare Administration and other city and state agencies. The case became a national scandal. Time magazine published a haunting photo of the girl on its cover, under the title, \u201ca shameful death: let down by the system, murdered by her mom, a little girl symbolizes america\u2019s failure to protect its children.\u201d The Child Welfare Administration was abolished, and ACS was created in its stead.\nIzquierdo\u2019s death sparked what has become a familiar pattern of overcorrection, common in the aftermath of such tragedies, in which child welfare officials ramp up family separations, in an effort to avoid another catastrophic \u201cmiss.\u201d Through the mid-\u201990s, notes a recent report by the Center for New York City Affairs, a policy research institute at the New School, the ACS caseworkers\u2019 union even counseled its members with the grim slogan, \u201cWhen in doubt, pull \u2019em out.\u201d And they did: In the three years following Izquierdo\u2019s death, the number of children taken into ACS custody increased by 50 percent.\nFamily preservation advocates like the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform call this a \u201cfoster care panic.\u201d It is hardly unique to New York. In the two years following the 1993 murder of a toddler in Illinois, the state\u2019s foster care system grew by 44 percent, rendering Illinois children more likely to end up in state custody than anywhere else in the United States.\nBut the need to intervene more is the wrong lesson to take from tragedy. \u201cChildren fall through the cracks not because child welfare agencies are devoting too much to family preservation,\u201d Dorothy Roberts writes, but \u201cbecause agencies are devoting too much to child removal.\u201d When there are too many children in foster care, she argues, there are neither enough foster homes to care for them, nor enough caseworkers with adequate time to identify those children who are truly at risk. Indeed, NCCPR notes, three years after the foster care panic began in Illinois, child deaths in the state had increased by 17 percent. Moreover, the focus on child protection creates perverse incentives for caseworkers and welfare agencies. \u201cThere has never been a preventive services worker in the history of child welfare who has ever been penalized for not helping a family enough,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cBut they are penalized all the time for not doing enough to protect the kid.\u201d\nIn 2016, a similar panic flared again, following the deaths in New York of two children whom ACS had left in their homes. That September, a six-year-old boy from Harlem named Zymere Perkins was allegedly beaten to death by his mother\u2019s boyfriend just weeks after an ACS caseworker closed his case. Two months later, three-year-old Jaden Jordan of Gravesend, Brooklyn, died. ACS had received an anonymous report that the boy was being kept in a dog crate, but for two days, caseworkers couldn\u2019t locate him, because they had been given the wrong address, and staff didn\u2019t know how to find the correct one in their system. Like Perkins, Jordan was allegedly beaten to death by his mother\u2019s boyfriend.\nThe ensuing public outcry was tremendous. \u201cHow ACS Failed Him,\u201d read the headline of a New York Post article detailing the abuse Perkins suffered. The city\u2019s other tabloid, the Daily News, lambasted Perkins\u2019s caseworker with a cover story that declared, \u201cshe let him die to get promoted.\u201d Then\u2013ACS Commissioner Gladys Carri\u00f3n, a reformer who had focused on preventive services intended to keep children out of foster care, resigned under pressure.\nSince then, ACS has been eager to repair its image. In June, it launched a public relations campaign featuring videos and subway ads with children and parents who\u2019d been involved with the system declaring, \u201cACS fought for my family.\u201d In June, the agency unveiled a \u201cCPS appreciation week,\u201d to honor New York City\u2019s child protective specialists, its \u201cfirst responders\u201d for children. And its new commissioner, David Hansell, who succeeded Carri\u00f3n in February 2017, has been courting the media in an effort to improve public perception of the agency.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of terrible tragedies,\u201d Hansell told me, \u201cand the dynamic we\u2019ve seen over and over again\u2014not just in New York City but across the country\u2014is that a terrible tragedy happens, it gets a lot of attention in the public, there are investigations, and so on. It leads the child welfare agency to be reactive and defensive and to be more draconian.\u201d He vowed to address this cycle by focusing on the root causes that underlie tragedies like child deaths, rather than seeking individuals or communities to blame.\nYet from 2016 to 2017, the number of children placed in foster care in the city increased 13 percent. Hansell attributed the increase not to caseworker reactiveness but to a rise in public reporting\u2014up 7 percent since 2016. However, in the year and a half following Perkins\u2019s death, ACS has also presided over a 54 percent increase in the number of cases it brought to family court, and a roughly 30 percent increase in emergency removals\u2014when ACS takes a child from parents before even seeing a judge. As a result, warned a July report from the Center for New York City Affairs, ACS staff caseloads have increased, families have been put on months-long waiting lists to receive preventive services, and family courts have been so swamped with cases that attorneys say it\u2019s led to \u201ca new level of dysfunction,\u201d with delays and deferrals \u201cthat impact every family in the system.\u201d\nI got a sense of this when I visited the Bronx Family Court, an imposing brutalist structure not far from Yankee Stadium. In June, in a windowless waiting room on the seventh floor, I watched a distraught young mother\u2014African American, like almost everyone else there\u2014approach the court clerk and two white lawyers who were complaining about the bad courthouse Wi-Fi and their children\u2019s college grades.\n\u201cExcuse me, what\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked. Her court- appointed attorney had left New York without anyone telling her, and her new lawyer hadn\u2019t shown up. \u201cI come every time [ACS] sets court appointments, and they never show,\u201d she said. The clerk apologized, then looked to one of the attorneys, who was there representing ACS: Maybe he should talk to the agency about why the mother\u2019s caseworker hadn\u2019t been in touch. The mother walked back to a wooden bench, where a young boy and an adult man waited silently. \u201cThis happens every day,\u201d she said, angry to the point of tears.\nInside one of the courtrooms, another African American woman, middle-aged, with braids pulled into a side bun, sat at the center of a U-shaped table, listening as her public defender explained that she\u2019d been accepted to an in-patient substance abuse program that allows parents to keep their children with them. A court-appointed guardian, there to represent the woman\u2019s young daughter, objected, saying it was too soon to place the child back in the mother\u2019s custody, and that the city should wait to see if she could stay sober. An ACS attorney concurred, arguing that the mother should only be allowed to see her daughter before entering rehab if she passed a drug test that day. The judge agreed to both requests, then asked the lawyers about their vacation plans before setting a date to reconvene in a month. The mother, whom no one had addressed directly, started to cry.\nIn Highbridge, a poor, predominantly African American and Latino neighborhood not far from the Bronx Family Court, a new program called Circle of Dreams opened in April. It is one of three Family Enrichment Centers that ACS is testing as part of its reform effort. Funded by ACS but operated by existing community nonprofits, the FECs are open to parents and nonparents, teenagers, and seniors alike, and can include food pantries, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 workshops, parenting groups, art classes, or just hang-out spots. Circle of Dreams is managed by Bridge Builders, a local group that focuses on family preservation. ACS is providing $450,000 in annual funding for the next three years.\nFrom the street, you could easily miss the entrance: a side door to the basement of a large prewar high-rise. Inside, however, the stairs lead to a series of bright rooms that seem to open endlessly onto one another. Chairs are clustered around a flat-screen TV streaming an image of a flickering log fire. There\u2019s a table with orange juice and sweet rolls. An alleyway covered in paver stones leads to a patio with a child\u2019s basketball hoop, a porch swing, and ivy-covered walls. There\u2019s a playroom, computer stations, a dining area with flowers on the tables, and a den in the back, where, on the day I visited, women had rolled back the carpet to host an impromptu Zumba class.\nThe center\u2019s programming is driven by client demand\u2014asking people what they need, and also what existing strengths the center can tap into. (In Highbridge, the almost ponderously deliberate practice of soliciting community feedback meant that some of the center\u2019s brightly painted walls were still bare in June; the process of polling the community on what art they wanted hadn\u2019t yet concluded.) In its first month of operation, the center hosted a \u201cparent caf\u00e9\u201d in the dining room, gathering parents from widely different backgrounds for food and guided discussion on topics like how to help your children talk to you. Unlike the GABI centers, which are focused on parents with open ACS cases, the goal of the FECs is to strengthen the community and reduce the need for ACS interventions. \u201cParents are isolated,\u201d said Alida Camacho, Circle of Dreams\u2019 director. \u201cIf you talk with most families who have cases of neglect, you\u2019re going to find that they\u2019re decent parents, that in a lot of areas they do have good parenting skills. But there are some areas where they don\u2019t.\u2026 In centers like this, we\u2019re hoping that we\u2019re going to hear it firsthand before something becomes an issue.\u201d\nSince the 1990s, when New York City placed almost 50,000 children into foster homes\u201410 percent of the country\u2019s entire foster care population\u2014its child welfare agency has reduced the number of child removals significantly. Today, approximately 9,000 children are in New York City\u2019s foster care system\u2014a sharp decline that is due, at least in part, to the aid that ACS\u2019s existing prevention programs provide. Yet ACS\u2019s successes have been tempered by the fact that, because many poor parents view ACS as inherently dangerous, they routinely walk away from the programs that are designed to support them, rather than invite child welfare into their lives. \u201cSo many people are scared that reaching out for help can mean ACS involvement,\u201d said Rise\u2019s Jeanette Vega. \u201cSo they don\u2019t reach out, they stay in their homes, and they don\u2019t get help for their problems.\u201d The distrust and fear that poor parents feel are roadblocks that ACS must overcome. \u201cNo child welfare system is going to work well when parents run away from the help that they\u2019re being offered,\u201d Martin Guggenheim said.\nGiven their experimental nature, Circle of Dreams and the other FECs are still figuring out how to define success. For now, they are mostly collecting anecdotes: a mother who came in looking for assistance with an electric bill and left with money management mentoring and a prom dress for her daughter; the teenagers who enjoy free pizza after school; the women dancing in the next room. The benefits, to a certain extent, are intangible. \u201cWe can count numbers,\u201d said Crystal Young-Scott, director of ACS\u2019s FEC program. \u201cBut what does that Zumba mean to these women?\u201d\nThe most important aspect of the centers, however, may be the fact that people can use them with a large degree of confidentiality. At Circle of Dreams, there\u2019s no intake process, no tracking database, no case management services where ACS checks in on parents. Employees are still mandated child abuse reporters, required by law to call the child abuse hotline if they suspect that a child is being mistreated. But an explicit goal of the center is to dispel the notion that asking for help automatically triggers ACS involvement. \u201cEveryone is so used to when you receive services, someone\u2019s going to open a case record,\u201d Camacho said. At Circle of Dreams, however, \u201cwhen people come in, you don\u2019t have to sign in if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nKailey Burger, ACS\u2019s assistant commissioner for Community Based Strategies\u2014a new division within ACS\u2019s prevention division\u2014worked as a lawyer in the Bronx Family Court in 2014, handling juvenile justice cases, before coming to believe that courts weren\u2019t the solution. \u201cBy the time the kids are in those systems, so many other systems have failed,\u201d she said. She decided to move \u201cupstream,\u201d to ACS, with the hopes that the child welfare agency could fix its poisoned relationship with poor communities of color and allow families to feel comfortable enough to ask for help before things reached a crisis point. In 2016, Burger partnered with Dr. Jacqueline Martin, the deputy commissioner of ACS\u2019s prevention division, to pursue initiatives like the GABI program and the FECs. The goal, Burger said, was to help families \u201cin a way that they retain dignity.\u201d\nThrough these pilot programs, Martin and Burger have been rethinking the role of ACS. \u201cWhat if families could really pursue their potential? What would they need to do that?\u201d said Martin. \u201cWhat if race and ethnicity didn\u2019t matter? What kind of child welfare system would we need?\u201d And more than anything else, they believe that ultimate success depends on ACS overcoming its toxic history with the families it wishes to serve. \u201cWe want this to be a new way of work,\u201d said Burger. \u201cNot working on or for a family, but partnering with them for as long as they want. And then we\u2019re gone.\u201d\nReformers who have spent years fighting for parents condemned by the system are still cautiously optimistic. ACS\u2019s new initiatives are only pilot programs, and they involve a fraction of the families that the agency works with each year. And if ACS\u2019s goal is to reduce its presence in parents\u2019 lives, statistics suggest that the opposite is true. From 2005 to 2017, the number of cases ACS has substantiated annually has grown from 33 percent to 40 percent. And the number of families ACS has placed under court-ordered supervision has increased from 1,947 to 7,490 per year over that same period. \u201cThe presence of ACS in neighborhoods is higher, and that\u2019s a bad change,\u201d said Nora McCarthy, the director of Rise. \u201cIf they\u2019re really committed to changing dynamics, they need to change the dynamics in which they\u2019re hauling so many families into court.\u201d\n\u201cOn paper, ACS\u2019s heart is in the right place,\u201d said Ginelle Stephenson, a social work supervisor at the Center for Family Representation, which provides lawyers to parents with ACS cases in Manhattan and Queens. But the new approach doesn\u2019t seem to be trickling down to the ACS rank and file. In meetings with caseworkers at foster care agencies, she said, well-intentioned bromides about not blaming or shaming parents tend to be forgotten by ACS workers loading up case plans with more services than parents can manage. \u201cA lot of what we do is say, \u2018She doesn\u2019t need that right now,\u2019\u201d said Stephenson. \u201cIt\u2019s supposedly voluntary, but there\u2019s a lot of undertone that, \u2018If you don\u2019t, we\u2019ll be watching.\u2019\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s still a concern that, despite their stated goals, the new pilot programs could become avenues for more ACS involvement in families\u2019 lives, rather than less. \u201cA really key test of whether there\u2019s a shift is when families go into FECs and see what\u2019s offered, how often is there going to be a report called in to a hotline,\u201d said Chris Gottlieb. \u201cI hope these will be helpful enough that they will outweigh that risk, but the more the staff sees themselves as monitors of the poor community, the less helpful it will be.\u201d\nBurger said she understands the skepticism, given the way ACS has traditionally worked with poor communities, and the footprint its other divisions still have. \u201cEvery time I go out and say I work for ACS, people say this is pie in the sky,\u201d she said. But she hopes the new programs will demonstrate ACS\u2019s commitment to a new way of doing things. \u201cIt\u2019s on us to continue keeping our word.\u201d\nThe pilot programs may be small in scope, but they could have a far-reaching impact on the child welfare landscape. Over the next year and a half, most of ACS\u2019s existing contracts for foster care and prevention programs will expire, providing the agency with an opportunity to implement its reform agenda on a wider scale. The programs that ACS works with going forward will determine the values and direction of the agency for at least the next decade. To Martin and Burger, it\u2019s a chance to create a more socially just child welfare system.\nThe ultimate challenge, though, may not be whether ACS can develop more supportive programs\u2014or even whether it can get poor families to trust the agency again. It\u2019s whether society as a whole can stop criminalizing poverty and embrace the idea that poor families are worthy of compassion. Even the best preventive services will flounder if they continue to be surrounded by a broader landscape in which caseworkers, investigators, attorneys, and family court judges treat poor parents as criminals. Even the most generous of programs cannot make up for government policies that force poor children to live in unsafe housing, drink lead-poisoned water, and go without adequate health care and education. \u201cThe whole existence of ACS lets us pretend that we\u2019re protecting children,\u201d said Emma Ketteringham, the managing director of family defense at the Bronx Defenders, a legal nonprofit that represents parents with ACS cases. \u201cBut if child protection was at the center of our priorities, that would require the government to rethink its relationship vis-\u00e0-vis children.\u201d\nOn the whole, however, government policy continues to adhere to the Social Darwinist conviction that the wealthy are most deserving because they are wealthy, and the only reason poor people are poor is because of some personal flaw. The overarching narrative, Martin Guggenheim said, is that \u201cthe only thing wrong with poor children is their parents.\u201d Overcoming that ideology will require us as a society to confront a harsh reality. \u201cThe truth about what\u2019s wrong with poor children,\u201d Guggenheim said, \u201cis they were born in America, in a system that doesn\u2019t care about them.\u201d\nThis article was written with support from the \u201cReporting Vulnerable Children in Care\u201d program, a journalism skills development program run by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in partnership with UBS\u2019s Optimus Foundation.",

In recent weeks, the justices added three cases related to electoral power and influence in the United States. One involves the Trump administration&rsquo;s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census; the other two will give the justices another opportunity to weigh the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering.</p>\n<p>Taken together, the rulings could have a dramatic effect on the shape and quality of American democracy for the next decade.</p>\n<p>Allowing the citizenship question on the census would undermine the survey&rsquo;s accuracy, compromising a decade&rsquo;s worth of legislative maps and tilting the playing field toward whiter and more rural communities at the expense of everyone else. And thwarting legal challenges to warped congressional districts would deny Americans a means of remedying another tool of political disempowerment. The Roberts Court may ultimately rule in ways that improve equal representation in America, but its track record gives little comfort that it will.</p>\n<p>Last week, the court <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/supreme-court-census-citizenship.html\">announced</a> it would hear <i>Department of Commerce</i> v. <i>New York</i>, the dispute over Trump&rsquo;s proposed citizenship question. The main purpose of the census is to count every living person within the United States&mdash;citizen and non-citizen alike&mdash;and thus ensure that each state has the appropriate number of members in the House of Representatives. But the data collected on gender, age, race, income, and more has a nearly endless set of other uses. State legislators use it to redraw their own legislative maps. Congress allocates hundreds of billions of dollars in federal domestic programs to the states based on their total population. Businesses use the data to determine where they should expand and how to cater to different communities. It fundamentally shapes how Americans engage with their civic institutions, and how those institutions engage with them.</p>\n<p>Adding a citizenship question is less innocuous than it may seem. A recent PRRI/<i>The Atlantic</i> survey found that 76 percent of Americans, including 81 percent of Republicans, <a href=\"https://www.prri.org/research/american-democracy-in-crisis-the-fate-of-pluralism-in-a-divided-nation/\">believe</a> the question will make the census inaccurate. Many experts, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/wilbur-ross-overruled-career-officials-at-census-bureau-to-add-citizenship-question\">including</a> the Census Bureau&rsquo;s career staff, fear that the question would measurably reduce participation among Hispanics and immigrants, and thus cause them to be underrepresented in the final data. The Trump administration&rsquo;s aggressive policies toward those communities has already made members of those communities <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/11/25/fear-trump-crackdown-haunts-daily-life-undocumented-immigrants/LozpzJlIpZS0mxQ34QMVvK/story.html\">reluctant to identify themselves</a> to the government <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/03/immigrants-nutrition-food-trump-crackdown-806292\">for other purposes</a>. The shadow of history also looms large: Federal agents <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/04/03/secret-use-of-census-info-helped-send-japanese-americans-to-internment-camps-in-wwii/\">secretly used</a> census data to locate and detain Japanese American families during World War II.</p>\n<p>Seventeen Democratic-led states and a coalition of immigrant rights groups sued last year to block the question. They argued that Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, violated the Administrative Procedures Act by ordering a citizenship question to be added in an &ldquo;arbitrary and capricious&rdquo; manner. Ross initially said a citizenship question was necessary to help the Justice Department enforce part of the Voting Rights Act. Government records made public during the trial <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/24/631537992/commerce-secretary-grew-impatient-over-census-citizenship-question-emails-reveal\">revealed</a>, however, that the question was added by Ross&rsquo;s initiative over the objections of career officials who warned it would have dire implications for the census&rsquo; accuracy.</p>\n<p>Judge Jesse Furman ruled against the Trump administration last month in a 220-page decision that excoriated the secretary of commerce. &ldquo;[Ross] failed to consider several important aspects of the problem; alternately ignored, cherry-picked, or badly misconstrued the evidence in the record before him; acted irrationally both in light of that evidence and his own stated decisional criteria; and failed to justify significant departures from past policies and practices&mdash;a veritable smorgasbord of classic, clear-cut APA violations,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>\n<p>Even a modest undercounting would seriously warp census data for the next decade, depriving states and cities across the country of federal funds and political power. Relying on expert testimony, Furman found that California would almost certainly lose seats in Congress, and that Arizona, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas would risk losses as well if a citizenship question was added to the census. Since many states use federal data to reapportion their own legislatures every ten years, the impact would also be felt in state and local politics. &ldquo;The addition of a citizenship question on the census will cause some jurisdictions and their residents to lose political power in that process as well,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>\n<p>If the Supreme Court sides with Ross and the administration, its rulings in two other cases could compound that effect. <i>Lamone</i> v. <i>Benisek</i> and <i>Rucho</i> v. <i>Common Cause </i>both revolve around partisan gerrymandering. Multiple federal courts have ruled over the last decade that the practice can be unconstitutional in extreme circumstances. At the same time, the Supreme Court has declined to say whether partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional or establish a test to determine when it goes too far. When the subject came before the justices last spring, they <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/149158/consequences-supreme-courts-punt-gerrymanderinghttps:/newrepublic.com/article/149158/consequences-supreme-courts-punt-gerrymandering\">ultimately punted</a> both cases in question back to the lower courts for further hearings.</p>\n<p><i>Lamone</i> was one of those cases. It centered on Maryland&rsquo;s 6th congressional district, which spans the western half of the state. The district had been a reliable GOP stronghold before Democratic state lawmakers redrew Maryland&rsquo;s legislative maps after the 2010 census. The new map shuffled tens of thousands of Republican voters into a neighboring district, a sum greater than what was needed to account for population changes. In the 2012 election, Democratic challenger John Delaney <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-faces-big-battle-over-partisan-gerrymandering/2018/11/24/490249f4-ec68-11e8-96d4-0d23f2aaad09_story.html\">ousted</a> GOP incumbent Roscoe Bartlett, who had won the previous ten races in the district, by a 20-point margin.</p>\n<p><i>Rucho</i>, the other case set to be argued this term, sprang from North Carolina&rsquo;s gerrymandering wars. North Carolina Republicans <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/08/28/north-carolinas-gerrymandering-case-could-make-or-break-democrats-momentum-partisan-gerrymandering/\">aggressively wield</a> redistricting powers to benefit themselves, securing at least nine of the state&rsquo;s 13 House seats&mdash;one seat <a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/article226452620.html\">remains in dispute</a> after last year&rsquo;s midterms&mdash;even though the state is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/29/us/politics/north-carolina-gerrymandering.html\">more evenly divided in its partisan affiliations</a>. They are hardly subtle about it, either. &ldquo;I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats,&rdquo; one Republican state lawmaker <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/08/28/north-carolinas-gerrymandering-case-could-make-or-break-democrats-momentum-partisan-gerrymandering/\">told his colleagues</a> when they redrew districts in 2016. &ldquo;So I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.&rdquo; The state legislature already had redrawn its post-2010 congressional districts after a federal court tossed out their first map in a racial-gerrymandering lawsuit. Now the Supreme Court will consider whether the voting-rights groups that brought the lawsuit have the standing to bring the case&mdash;and whether the courts can remedy the problem at all.</p>\n<p>Litigants in both cases argue that partisan gerrymandering violates the First Amendment, either by retaliating against voters for their political preferences or by diluting their ability to influence the electoral process. Most of the justices have acknowledged in past cases that partisan gerrymandering is a problem, but they have yet to rally around a legal standard to determine when a map crosses the line. In <i>Gill</i> v. <i>Whitford</i>, a case heard last term, the plaintiffs <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/147672/can-us-supreme-court-stop-gerrymandering\">proposed</a> using a mathematical formula known as the &ldquo;efficiency gap&rdquo; to quantify the problem. Chief Justice John Roberts described those efforts as &ldquo;sociological gobbledygook&rdquo; during oral arguments last term.</p>\n<p>His skepticism isn&rsquo;t surprising. A major theme of Roberts&rsquo;s tenure is redistributing the balance of American political power in a less democratic direction. The court&rsquo;s decision in <i>Citizens United</i>, for example, gave wealthier Americans <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/opinion/democracy-drowning-cash.html\">even greater influence</a> over political candidates and policy decisions by loosening campaign finance restrictions. In <i>Shelby County</i> v. <i>Holder</i>, Roberts and the other conservative justices gutted one of the core provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/04/shelby-county-v-holder-voting-rights-supreme-court/522867/\">ushering in a new dark age</a> of voter suppression. With Anthony Kennedy&rsquo;s retirement and Brett Kavanaugh&rsquo;s confirmation, the court has moved further to the right than at any other time in recent history. This term&rsquo;s slate of cases could give Roberts and his allies a chance to set American democracy even further back.</p>",

                "text": "The Supreme Court\u2019s current term may have started with a whimper, but it will end with a bang. In recent weeks, the justices added three cases related to electoral power and influence in the United States. One involves the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census; the other two will give the justices another opportunity to weigh the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering.\nTaken together, the rulings could have a dramatic effect on the shape and quality of American democracy for the next decade.\nAllowing the citizenship question on the census would undermine the survey\u2019s accuracy, compromising a decade\u2019s worth of legislative maps and tilting the playing field toward whiter and more rural communities at the expense of everyone else. And thwarting legal challenges to warped congressional districts would deny Americans a means of remedying another tool of political disempowerment. The Roberts Court may ultimately rule in ways that improve equal representation in America, but its track record gives little comfort that it will.\nLast week, the court announced it would hear Department of Commerce v. New York, the dispute over Trump\u2019s proposed citizenship question. The main purpose of the census is to count every living person within the United States\u2014citizen and non-citizen alike\u2014and thus ensure that each state has the appropriate number of members in the House of Representatives. But the data collected on gender, age, race, income, and more has a nearly endless set of other uses. State legislators use it to redraw their own legislative maps. Congress allocates hundreds of billions of dollars in federal domestic programs to the states based on their total population. Businesses use the data to determine where they should expand and how to cater to different communities. It fundamentally shapes how Americans engage with their civic institutions, and how those institutions engage with them.\nAdding a citizenship question is less innocuous than it may seem. A recent PRRI/The Atlantic survey found that 76 percent of Americans, including 81 percent of Republicans, believe the question will make the census inaccurate. Many experts, including the Census Bureau\u2019s career staff, fear that the question would measurably reduce participation among Hispanics and immigrants, and thus cause them to be underrepresented in the final data. The Trump administration\u2019s aggressive policies toward those communities has already made members of those communities reluctant to identify themselves to the government for other purposes. The shadow of history also looms large: Federal agents secretly used census data to locate and detain Japanese American families during World War II.\nSeventeen Democratic-led states and a coalition of immigrant rights groups sued last year to block the question. They argued that Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, violated the Administrative Procedures Act by ordering a citizenship question to be added in an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d manner. Ross initially said a citizenship question was necessary to help the Justice Department enforce part of the Voting Rights Act. Government records made public during the trial revealed, however, that the question was added by Ross\u2019s initiative over the objections of career officials who warned it would have dire implications for the census\u2019 accuracy.\nJudge Jesse Furman ruled against the Trump administration last month in a 220-page decision that excoriated the secretary of commerce. \u201c[Ross] failed to consider several important aspects of the problem; alternately ignored, cherry-picked, or badly misconstrued the evidence in the record before him; acted irrationally both in light of that evidence and his own stated decisional criteria; and failed to justify significant departures from past policies and practices\u2014a veritable smorgasbord of classic, clear-cut APA violations,\u201d he wrote.\nEven a modest undercounting would seriously warp census data for the next decade, depriving states and cities across the country of federal funds and political power. Relying on expert testimony, Furman found that California would almost certainly lose seats in Congress, and that Arizona, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas would risk losses as well if a citizenship question was added to the census. Since many states use federal data to reapportion their own legislatures every ten years, the impact would also be felt in state and local politics. \u201cThe addition of a citizenship question on the census will cause some jurisdictions and their residents to lose political power in that process as well,\u201d he wrote.\nIf the Supreme Court sides with Ross and the administration, its rulings in two other cases could compound that effect. Lamone v. Benisek and Rucho v. Common Cause both revolve around partisan gerrymandering. Multiple federal courts have ruled over the last decade that the practice can be unconstitutional in extreme circumstances. At the same time, the Supreme Court has declined to say whether partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional or establish a test to determine when it goes too far. When the subject came before the justices last spring, they ultimately punted both cases in question back to the lower courts for further hearings.\nLamone was one of those cases. It centered on Maryland\u2019s 6th congressional district, which spans the western half of the state. The district had been a reliable GOP stronghold before Democratic state lawmakers redrew Maryland\u2019s legislative maps after the 2010 census. The new map shuffled tens of thousands of Republican voters into a neighboring district, a sum greater than what was needed to account for population changes. In the 2012 election, Democratic challenger John Delaney ousted GOP incumbent Roscoe Bartlett, who had won the previous ten races in the district, by a 20-point margin.\nRucho, the other case set to be argued this term, sprang from North Carolina\u2019s gerrymandering wars. North Carolina Republicans aggressively wield redistricting powers to benefit themselves, securing at least nine of the state\u2019s 13 House seats\u2014one seat remains in dispute after last year\u2019s midterms\u2014even though the state is more evenly divided in its partisan affiliations. They are hardly subtle about it, either. \u201cI think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats,\u201d one Republican state lawmaker told his colleagues when they redrew districts in 2016. \u201cSo I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.\u201d The state legislature already had redrawn its post-2010 congressional districts after a federal court tossed out their first map in a racial-gerrymandering lawsuit. Now the Supreme Court will consider whether the voting-rights groups that brought the lawsuit have the standing to bring the case\u2014and whether the courts can remedy the problem at all.\nLitigants in both cases argue that partisan gerrymandering violates the First Amendment, either by retaliating against voters for their political preferences or by diluting their ability to influence the electoral process. Most of the justices have acknowledged in past cases that partisan gerrymandering is a problem, but they have yet to rally around a legal standard to determine when a map crosses the line. In Gill v. Whitford, a case heard last term, the plaintiffs proposed using a mathematical formula known as the \u201cefficiency gap\u201d to quantify the problem. Chief Justice John Roberts described those efforts as \u201csociological gobbledygook\u201d during oral arguments last term.\nHis skepticism isn\u2019t surprising. A major theme of Roberts\u2019s tenure is redistributing the balance of American political power in a less democratic direction. The court\u2019s decision in Citizens United, for example, gave wealthier Americans even greater influence over political candidates and policy decisions by loosening campaign finance restrictions. In Shelby County v. Holder, Roberts and the other conservative justices gutted one of the core provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, ushering in a new dark age of voter suppression. With Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement and Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, the court has moved further to the right than at any other time in recent history. This term\u2019s slate of cases could give Roberts and his allies a chance to set American democracy even further back.",

On Friday, in an encounter caught on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BayAreaSunrise/videos/2101109139978731/UzpfSTI2MzYxNTMzNDExNjgwOTo1NjIwNzgxNDA5MzcxOTI/\">video</a>, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told a group of teenage and preteen climate activists that she won&rsquo;t support the Green New Deal, an ambitious plan to fight climate change introduced by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/07/691997301/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-releases-green-new-deal-outline\">earlier this month</a>. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way to pay for it,&rdquo; she said, referring to the plan&rsquo;s pledge to decarbonize the U.S. economy by the year 2030.</p>\n<p>The children pleaded with Feinstein to be &ldquo;brave&rdquo; and to think about their future. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the ones who are going to be impacted,&rdquo; one girl pleaded.

She has a <a href=\"http://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/dianne-feinstein\">90 percent</a> lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters, while Trump is withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris agreement and his EPA is methodically attempting to undo everything it accomplished under President Barack Obama. But the California senator is the bigger threat to the left&rsquo;s goal of slowing climate change before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>\n<p>The Earth has already warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius due to greenhouse gases released by mankind. Some scientists say the warming must remain below 1.5 degrees Celsius&mdash;or 2 degrees Celsius, according to others&mdash;to avoid an irreversible catastrophe. Meeting that goal will require the boldest action imaginable. There are <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/democrats-should-embrace-flawed-ambitious-green-new-deal.html\">bolder plans imaginable</a> than the Green New Deal, but it&rsquo;s certainly the boldest action that a significant number of politicians have ever backed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Green New Deal is one of the largest interventions in U.S. industrial policy in a long time,&rdquo; Rhiana Gunn-Wright, who helped draft Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s proposal, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/green-new-deal-economic-principles/582943/\">told</a> <i>The Atlantic</i>&rsquo;s Robinson Meyer. The proposal calls for government funding to kickstart a green industrial revolution, replacing America&rsquo;s gas-powered cars with electric ones, installing high-speed rail across the country, and converting the electricity system to renewables&mdash;all within the next 12 years.</p>\n<p>The Green New Deal is impossible to pass in a divided government, which is precisely why it&rsquo;s been criticized by Democratic leaders like Feinstein and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who recently dismissed the Green New Deal as &ldquo;the green dream, or whatever they call it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s the <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/153096/green-new-deal-alternatives-reversing-climate-change\">alternative</a>, then? Feinstein&rsquo;s counterproposal would do little to make a difference. It seeks to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050&mdash;an acceptable goal, albeit 20 years later than the Green New Deal&rsquo;s. But to achieve this, Feinstein&rsquo;s resolution only proposes three things: re-implementing myriad Obama-era climate regulations, re-joining the Paris agreement, and implementing a national price on carbon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that these things are <em>wrong</em>,&rdquo; environmental activist Bill McKibben<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-hard-lessons-of-dianne-feinsteins-encounter-with-the-young-green-new-deal-activists-video\"> wrote</a> in <i>The</i> <i>New Yorker</i> over the weekend. <em>&ldquo;</em>It&rsquo;s that they are <em>insufficient</em>, impossibly so.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The problem with Democrats like Feinstein is that they <a href=\"https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=80C88733-D29F-4744-B2C5-8B3A10BD6781\">make a big show of calling for action on climate change</a>. And yet, their solutions prove they don&rsquo;t grasp that climate change is, as Dave Roberts put it for Vox, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/2/23/18228142/green-new-deal-critics\">a fucking emergency</a>.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t grasp, as David Wallace-Wells writes in his new book, <i><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/2/22/18188562/climate-change-david-wallace-wells-the-uninhabitable-earth\">The Uninhabitable Earth</a></i>, that 2 degrees Celsius means &ldquo;tens of millions of climate refugees, perhaps many more, fleeing droughts, flooding and extreme heat, and the possibility of multiple climate-driven natural disasters striking simultaneously.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Meek policies, like those proposed by Feinstein, will ensure at least 3 degrees of warming. By that point, Wallace-Wells writes, &ldquo;Southern Europe would be in permanent drought, African droughts would last five years on average, and the areas burned annually by wildfires in the United States could quadruple, or worse, from last year&rsquo;s million-plus acres.&rdquo; Hopefully things will not reach 4 degrees, where &ldquo;six natural disasters could strike a single community simultaneously; the number of climate refugees, already in the millions, could grow tenfold, or 20-fold, or more; and, globally, damages from warming could reach $600 trillion&mdash;about double all the wealth that exists in the world today.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Right now, even with emissions reductions already in place, the world is well on its way to 4 degree Celsius, according to the United Nations. Democrats like Feinstein are right to be concerned that something like the Green New Deal won&rsquo;t pass, but their alternative does about as much to prevent this future as Trump&rsquo;s policies do to worsen it. Trump&rsquo;s climate denial, and Feinstein&rsquo;s climate advocacy, both have a negligible impact on a problem of this scale. This emergency calls for wholesale societal change.</p>\n<p>Passing such a monumental plan will indeed require support from Republicans. But the Democratic fracturing over the Green New Deal ensures the GOP will continue to do nothing. When the proposal first gained steam among Democratic voters, but before the party&rsquo;s leaders were pressed for their position on it, some conservatives argued <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/republican-lawmakers-face-pressure-to-propose-green-new-deal-alternative\">that Republicans needed to come up with an alternative.</a> As Feinstein and Pelosi signal that the Green New Deal is dead in the water, though, Republicans have an excuse to ignore the issue altogether. They can sit back and watch the Democrats tear each other apart over the issue, while the clock runs out on addressing the most challenging crisis of our time.</p>\n<p>Given this partisan reality, there&rsquo;s only one conceivable path for success in slowing global warming: Voters have to kick Republicans out of office. To have any chance of enacting meaningful climate legislation, Democrats not only must control the White House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate; they must be in complete agreement about what needs to be done. Feinstein&rsquo;s scolding of schoolchildren suggests that the Democratic Party would squander that opportunity instead, killing the last real chance for bold action. That&rsquo;s not all it would kill, either.</p>",

                "text": "As climate change worsens, so does President Donald Trump\u2019s denial. On Sunday, The Washington Post reported that his administration is assembling a panel of fringe, industry-funded scientists who \u201crepresent the Trump administration\u2019s most forceful effort to date to challenge the scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are helping drive global warming and that the world could face dire consequences unless countries curb their carbon output over the next few decades.\u201d\nAs Trump denies, though, Democrats delay. On Friday, in an encounter caught on video, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told a group of teenage and preteen climate activists that she won\u2019t support the Green New Deal, an ambitious plan to fight climate change introduced by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey earlier this month. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to pay for it,\u201d she said, referring to the plan\u2019s pledge to decarbonize the U.S. economy by the year 2030.\nThe children pleaded with Feinstein to be \u201cbrave\u201d and to think about their future. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who are going to be impacted,\u201d one girl pleaded. The 85-year-old insisted she understood, citing her seven grandchildren, but then dashed the schoolchildren\u2019s hopes. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the Senate for over a quarter of a century,\u201d she said, \u201cand I know what can pass and I know what can\u2019t pass.\u201d Later, Feinstein put out a statement calling climate change one of her top priorities and released a draft resolution of her alternative to the Green New Deal.\nThis is how @SenFeinstein reacted to children asking her to support the #GreenNewDeal resolution -- with smugness + disrespect.This is a fight for our generation's survival. Her reaction is why young people desperately want new leadership in Congress. pic.twitter.com/0zAkaxruMI\n\u2014 Sunrise Movement \ud83c\udf05 (@sunrisemvmt) February 22, 2019\nFeinstein is not a climate villain on par with Trump. She has a 90 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters, while Trump is withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris agreement and his EPA is methodically attempting to undo everything it accomplished under President Barack Obama. But the California senator is the bigger threat to the left\u2019s goal of slowing climate change before it\u2019s too late.\nThe Earth has already warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius due to greenhouse gases released by mankind. Some scientists say the warming must remain below 1.5 degrees Celsius\u2014or 2 degrees Celsius, according to others\u2014to avoid an irreversible catastrophe. Meeting that goal will require the boldest action imaginable. There are bolder plans imaginable than the Green New Deal, but it\u2019s certainly the boldest action that a significant number of politicians have ever backed.\n\u201cThe Green New Deal is one of the largest interventions in U.S. industrial policy in a long time,\u201d Rhiana Gunn-Wright, who helped draft Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposal, told The Atlantic\u2019s Robinson Meyer. The proposal calls for government funding to kickstart a green industrial revolution, replacing America\u2019s gas-powered cars with electric ones, installing high-speed rail across the country, and converting the electricity system to renewables\u2014all within the next 12 years.\nThe Green New Deal is impossible to pass in a divided government, which is precisely why it\u2019s been criticized by Democratic leaders like Feinstein and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who recently dismissed the Green New Deal as \u201cthe green dream, or whatever they call it.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the alternative, then? Feinstein\u2019s counterproposal would do little to make a difference. It seeks to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050\u2014an acceptable goal, albeit 20 years later than the Green New Deal\u2019s. But to achieve this, Feinstein\u2019s resolution only proposes three things: re-implementing myriad Obama-era climate regulations, re-joining the Paris agreement, and implementing a national price on carbon. \u201cIt\u2019s not that these things are wrong,\u201d environmental activist Bill McKibben wrote in The New Yorker over the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s that they are insufficient, impossibly so.\u201d\nThe problem with Democrats like Feinstein is that they make a big show of calling for action on climate change. And yet, their solutions prove they don\u2019t grasp that climate change is, as Dave Roberts put it for Vox, \u201ca fucking emergency.\u201d They don\u2019t grasp, as David Wallace-Wells writes in his new book, The Uninhabitable Earth, that 2 degrees Celsius means \u201ctens of millions of climate refugees, perhaps many more, fleeing droughts, flooding and extreme heat, and the possibility of multiple climate-driven natural disasters striking simultaneously.\u201d\nMeek policies, like those proposed by Feinstein, will ensure at least 3 degrees of warming. By that point, Wallace-Wells writes, \u201cSouthern Europe would be in permanent drought, African droughts would last five years on average, and the areas burned annually by wildfires in the United States could quadruple, or worse, from last year\u2019s million-plus acres.\u201d Hopefully things will not reach 4 degrees, where \u201csix natural disasters could strike a single community simultaneously; the number of climate refugees, already in the millions, could grow tenfold, or 20-fold, or more; and, globally, damages from warming could reach $600 trillion\u2014about double all the wealth that exists in the world today.\u201d\nRight now, even with emissions reductions already in place, the world is well on its way to 4 degree Celsius, according to the United Nations. Democrats like Feinstein are right to be concerned that something like the Green New Deal won\u2019t pass, but their alternative does about as much to prevent this future as Trump\u2019s policies do to worsen it. Trump\u2019s climate denial, and Feinstein\u2019s climate advocacy, both have a negligible impact on a problem of this scale. This emergency calls for wholesale societal change.\nPassing such a monumental plan will indeed require support from Republicans. But the Democratic fracturing over the Green New Deal ensures the GOP will continue to do nothing. When the proposal first gained steam among Democratic voters, but before the party\u2019s leaders were pressed for their position on it, some conservatives argued that Republicans needed to come up with an alternative. As Feinstein and Pelosi signal that the Green New Deal is dead in the water, though, Republicans have an excuse to ignore the issue altogether. They can sit back and watch the Democrats tear each other apart over the issue, while the clock runs out on addressing the most challenging crisis of our time.\nGiven this partisan reality, there\u2019s only one conceivable path for success in slowing global warming: Voters have to kick Republicans out of office. To have any chance of enacting meaningful climate legislation, Democrats not only must control the White House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate; they must be in complete agreement about what needs to be done. Feinstein\u2019s scolding of schoolchildren suggests that the Democratic Party would squander that opportunity instead, killing the last real chance for bold action. That\u2019s not all it would kill, either.",

According to multiple news organizations, special counsel Robert Mueller is preparing to report his findings to Attorney General Bill Barr in the coming weeks. It&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/21/its-mueller-time-apparently-here-are-big-questions/\">unclear</a> what the report will say&mdash;and how much of it Barr will make public&mdash;but it&rsquo;s entirely possible, even likely, that Mueller has not found conclusive proof of a corrupt bargain between the Trump campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>If so, that may be because no such evidence exists. But it&rsquo;s more likely that President Trump&rsquo;s effort to hinder the Russia investigation simply worked&mdash;specifically, his implicit promise to pardon allies in exchange for their silence.</p>\n<p>The case of Paul Manafort is illustrative. Mueller scored a major victory in September when the former Trump campaign chairman agreed to cooperate with the investigation. I <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/151237/robert-mueller-winning\">noted at the time</a> that Manafort was one of the few Americans who could give a comprehensive account of the Trump campaign&rsquo;s interactions with Russia. His extensive ties to Moscow made him the most likely conduit for an explicit quid pro quo arrangement with the Kremlin if one took place. Manafort was also the only American participant in the infamous Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 who was not related to the president by blood or marriage.</p>\n<p>Former federal prosecutors noted how Mueller&rsquo;s approach seemed to mirror traditional white-collar and organized-crime cases: Strike bargains with low-level members of a conspiracy, get testimony against higher-level members of it, and work your way in. The collapse of Manafort&rsquo;s plea deal may have short-circuited that strategy, perhaps fatally. In November, Mueller told a federal judge that he believed Manafort had breached his plea agreement by lying to federal prosecutors multiple times. The judge largely agreed with that assessment earlier this month.</p>\n<p>Why would Manafort implode a deal that would secure him a shorter prison sentence? Trump&rsquo;s implicit offer of pardons appears to have played a role. The Russia investigation always operated under this sword of Damocles. Presidential pardons don&rsquo;t affect state prosecutions, however, making the latter a fail-safe of sorts in case the president started to shut down Mueller&rsquo;s inquiry. The special counsel&rsquo;s office reportedly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/30/manafort-mueller-probe-attorney-general-242191\">began working</a> with the New York attorney general&rsquo;s office in the summer of 2017 on the financial-crimes portion of Manafort&rsquo;s case. Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. is also reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/nyregion/manafort-pardon-trump.html\">preparing to file charges</a> against Manafort soon.</p>\n<p>Trump has been signaling his views on the pardon power for years. In August 2017, he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/25/politics/sheriff-joe-arpaio-donald-trump-pardon/index.html\">pardoned</a> former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of contempt of court for racially profiling Hispanic motorists despite a judge&rsquo;s order to desist. Last summer, Trump also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/us/politics/trump-pardon-dsouza.html\">wiped away</a> conservative filmmaker Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza&rsquo;s conviction for campaign finance violations. Both men staunchly support the president and blamed politicized investigations for their downfall. While Trump isn&rsquo;t the first president to misuse the power of mercy, the two pardons made it unusually clear that he would wield pardons for purely partisan gain.</p>\n<p>After a Virginia jury convicted Manafort on multiple charges last August, Trump became even less subtle. The president <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/150878/trump-trying-bribe-paul-manafort\">publicly lauded</a> his former campaign chairman for refusing to &ldquo;make up stories in order to get a &lsquo;deal&rsquo;&rdquo; while harshly criticizing Michael Cohen, his former personal attorney, for cooperating with investigators. Hours later, Rudy Giuliani told reporters that the president wouldn&rsquo;t be issuing any pardons until the investigation had wrapped up. Taken together, the two messages suggested pardons would be on the table if their potential recipients kept quiet. <i>The New York Times</i> reported earlier this month that Trump&rsquo;s lawyers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-investigations.html\">made similar assurances</a> in private as well.</p>\n<p>These efforts haven&rsquo;t gone unnoticed by the special counsel&rsquo;s office. In a sealed hearing earlier this month, Mueller&rsquo;s team offered two motives for why Manafort lied to them about part of the investigation. One of those motives is obscured by a thicket of partial redactions in the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/07/politics/transcript-paul-manafort-hearing/index.html\">official transcript</a>; the other is that telling the truth could have &ldquo;negative consequences in terms of the other motive that Mr. Manafort could have, which is to at least augment his chances of a pardon.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Most discussions of the Russia investigation center around the most important line of Mueller&rsquo;s inquiry: whether the Trump campaign illegally conspired with the Russian government during the 2016 election. But even if Mueller doesn&rsquo;t find evidence of this, his investigation has already proven its worth by uncovering a viper&rsquo;s nest of illegal conduct during the 2016 election. He shed light on how Russian operatives used social media networks to manipulate and influence public opinion. He uncovered suspicious contacts between Russian operatives and Trump campaign officials, and showed how they lied to keep those contacts hidden from the public. He also may have uncovered serious wrongdoing by the Trump Organization and the president&rsquo;s inaugural committee, both of which are now under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York and Washington.</p>\n<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget the other investigative path that Mueller is pursuing, which may turn out to be more legally significant than the collusion question: whether Trump obstructed justice by firing FBI Director James Comey. Trump&rsquo;s implicit offer of pardons to erstwhile co-conspirators could bolster an obstruction-of-justice case against the president. Even his latest pick to run the Justice Department acknowledged the potential legal peril. &ldquo;Do you believe a president could lawfully issue a pardon in exchange for the recipients&rsquo; promise to not incriminate him?&rdquo; Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/152911/bill-barr-day-one-attorney-general-confirmation-hearing\">asked Barr</a> during his confirmation hearing. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the attorney general replied. &ldquo;That would be a crime.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That may give some solace to Trump&rsquo;s opponents as the Russia investigation moves from the Justice Department to the halls of Congress.

                "text": "The Russia investigation may be drawing to a close. According to multiple news organizations, special counsel Robert Mueller is preparing to report his findings to Attorney General Bill Barr in the coming weeks. It\u2019s unclear what the report will say\u2014and how much of it Barr will make public\u2014but it\u2019s entirely possible, even likely, that Mueller has not found conclusive proof of a corrupt bargain between the Trump campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 election.\nIf so, that may be because no such evidence exists. But it\u2019s more likely that President Trump\u2019s effort to hinder the Russia investigation simply worked\u2014specifically, his implicit promise to pardon allies in exchange for their silence.\nThe case of Paul Manafort is illustrative. Mueller scored a major victory in September when the former Trump campaign chairman agreed to cooperate with the investigation. I noted at the time that Manafort was one of the few Americans who could give a comprehensive account of the Trump campaign\u2019s interactions with Russia. His extensive ties to Moscow made him the most likely conduit for an explicit quid pro quo arrangement with the Kremlin if one took place. Manafort was also the only American participant in the infamous Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 who was not related to the president by blood or marriage.\nFormer federal prosecutors noted how Mueller\u2019s approach seemed to mirror traditional white-collar and organized-crime cases: Strike bargains with low-level members of a conspiracy, get testimony against higher-level members of it, and work your way in. The collapse of Manafort\u2019s plea deal may have short-circuited that strategy, perhaps fatally. In November, Mueller told a federal judge that he believed Manafort had breached his plea agreement by lying to federal prosecutors multiple times. The judge largely agreed with that assessment earlier this month.\nWhy would Manafort implode a deal that would secure him a shorter prison sentence? Trump\u2019s implicit offer of pardons appears to have played a role. The Russia investigation always operated under this sword of Damocles. Presidential pardons don\u2019t affect state prosecutions, however, making the latter a fail-safe of sorts in case the president started to shut down Mueller\u2019s inquiry. The special counsel\u2019s office reportedly began working with the New York attorney general\u2019s office in the summer of 2017 on the financial-crimes portion of Manafort\u2019s case. Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. is also reportedly preparing to file charges against Manafort soon.\nTrump has been signaling his views on the pardon power for years. In August 2017, he pardoned former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of contempt of court for racially profiling Hispanic motorists despite a judge\u2019s order to desist. Last summer, Trump also wiped away conservative filmmaker Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s conviction for campaign finance violations. Both men staunchly support the president and blamed politicized investigations for their downfall. While Trump isn\u2019t the first president to misuse the power of mercy, the two pardons made it unusually clear that he would wield pardons for purely partisan gain.\nAfter a Virginia jury convicted Manafort on multiple charges last August, Trump became even less subtle. The president publicly lauded his former campaign chairman for refusing to \u201cmake up stories in order to get a \u2018deal\u2019\u201d while harshly criticizing Michael Cohen, his former personal attorney, for cooperating with investigators. Hours later, Rudy Giuliani told reporters that the president wouldn\u2019t be issuing any pardons until the investigation had wrapped up. Taken together, the two messages suggested pardons would be on the table if their potential recipients kept quiet. The New York Times reported earlier this month that Trump\u2019s lawyers made similar assurances in private as well.\nThese efforts haven\u2019t gone unnoticed by the special counsel\u2019s office. In a sealed hearing earlier this month, Mueller\u2019s team offered two motives for why Manafort lied to them about part of the investigation. One of those motives is obscured by a thicket of partial redactions in the official transcript; the other is that telling the truth could have \u201cnegative consequences in terms of the other motive that Mr. Manafort could have, which is to at least augment his chances of a pardon.\u201d\nMost discussions of the Russia investigation center around the most important line of Mueller\u2019s inquiry: whether the Trump campaign illegally conspired with the Russian government during the 2016 election. But even if Mueller doesn\u2019t find evidence of this, his investigation has already proven its worth by uncovering a viper\u2019s nest of illegal conduct during the 2016 election. He shed light on how Russian operatives used social media networks to manipulate and influence public opinion. He uncovered suspicious contacts between Russian operatives and Trump campaign officials, and showed how they lied to keep those contacts hidden from the public. He also may have uncovered serious wrongdoing by the Trump Organization and the president\u2019s inaugural committee, both of which are now under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York and Washington.\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the other investigative path that Mueller is pursuing, which may turn out to be more legally significant than the collusion question: whether Trump obstructed justice by firing FBI Director James Comey. Trump\u2019s implicit offer of pardons to erstwhile co-conspirators could bolster an obstruction-of-justice case against the president. Even his latest pick to run the Justice Department acknowledged the potential legal peril. \u201cDo you believe a president could lawfully issue a pardon in exchange for the recipients\u2019 promise to not incriminate him?\u201d Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy asked Barr during his confirmation hearing. \u201cNo,\u201d the attorney general replied. \u201cThat would be a crime.\u201d\nThat may give some solace to Trump\u2019s opponents as the Russia investigation moves from the Justice Department to the halls of Congress. Mueller\u2019s findings on obstruction of justice, should they be made available to lawmakers, could make it easier to remove the president from office. But the obstruction will have already done its damage. By floating pardons in exchange for silence, Trump denied Americans the fullest possible answer to a question that\u2019s been haunting the nation since the Russia investigation began: What happened?",

A <a href=\"https://www.2yt4u.com/product-page/t-shirt-love-animal-respect-nature-vol-ii-blanc-noir\">t-shirt</a> showing a mountain and deer and the slogan &ldquo;Respect Nature.&rdquo; A black <a href=\"https://europeanbrotherhood.com/shop/product/eb-short-sleeve-classic-polo-black/\">polo shirt</a> with black, white, and red piping and a small circular logo. A <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtRHiKzl90K/\">sweater</a> showing a child on a parent&rsquo;s shoulders at a soccer match, holding up a supporter&rsquo;s scarf, with &ldquo;Keep the Tradition&rdquo; underneath.</p>\n<p>But look a bit closer. That symbol behind the deer? It&rsquo;s a black sun, a common neo-Nazi symbol adapted from a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wewelsburg#/media/File:Schwarze_Sonne_Obergruppenf%C3%BChrersaal_(SS_Generals%27_Hall).jpg\">floor mosaic</a> in Heinrich Himmler&rsquo;s SS Generals&rsquo; Hall. That logo on the polo shirt? It looks like a broken sun cross-style swastika. And the child on his parent&rsquo;s back? He&rsquo;s got the number 88 on their back&mdash;neo-Nazi <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/88_(number)\">code</a> for &ldquo;Heil Hitler.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And there&rsquo;s more where these came from. Far-right fashion in Europe has become a niche industry over the past decade. Brands <a href=\"https://www.thorsteinar.de/\">big</a> and small have given everyone from hardened neo-Nazis to young men flirting with the far-right subcultures a way to express themselves that doesn&rsquo;t fit neatly into what many think a far-right extremist is supposed to look like.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s hardly just about looking cool or tough, or playing coy little games with adults who aren&rsquo;t well-versed in the subtleties of fascist symbolism; far-right fashion can help extremist devotees, especially young men, build a stronger sense of belonging and brotherhood, and even act as a gateway to radicalization. And those who have their eyes on the far-right fashion scene in Europe think the U.S. is next.</p>\n<p>The examples described above are hardly one-offs. The French brand with the &ldquo;Respect Nature&rdquo; shirt also sells shirts with &ldquo;HTLR&rdquo; in block letters with the official SS motto underneath. The Italian creators of the black-white-red polo shirt also sell sweaters bearing the letters &ldquo;WPWW,&rdquo; for &ldquo;White Pride World Wide.&rdquo; And a Ukrainian store that sells the &ldquo;Keep the Tradition&rdquo; sweater is selling tickets for a neo-Nazi concert this summer featuring a band whose former guitar player murdered six people in a hate crime at a Wisconsin Sikh temple in 2012.</p>\n<p>The last decade has seen a number of far-right fashion brands make a name for themselves among Europe&rsquo;s far-right extremists. The most <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/121199/germanys-thor-steinar-neo-nazis-favorite-clothing-brand\">well-known</a> of them, Germany&rsquo;s Thor Steinar, has been marketing itself to the far right for years. The multimillion-dollar company, now based in Dubai, has shops across Germany and online that sell t-shirts, sweaters and jackets bearing Nordic-themed imagery popular among devotees of the far-right, but also slogans like &ldquo;Save the White Continent.&rdquo; Thor Steinar&rsquo;s logo resembles a combination of two Nazi-era symbols, the <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/tyr-rune\">T-rune</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/wolfsangel\">Wolfsangel</a>, that are themselves banned in Germany. The brand&rsquo;s clothing is also banned in a number of German schools, soccer stadiums, and even in Germany&rsquo;s lower house of parliament.</p>\n<p>Wearing Thor Steinar or other far-right brands isn&rsquo;t just about looking cool. Fashion, says New School sociologist Virag Molnar, is an important way for individuals in far-right groups, especially young men, to form their identities and make a statement to each other and to those outside the group.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Using style to express and conspicuously display group identity and to make a political statement is integral to subcultures,&rdquo; Molnar told me by email. What&rsquo;s more, she adds, because members of far-right groups are often only infrequently connected face-to-face, with much of their interaction online, &ldquo;their like-mindedness and shared values can be (visibly) expressed and experienced through consumption.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside>This &ldquo;valorization of violence&rdquo; is something that&rsquo;s targeted specifically at young men. </aside>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of relatively new far-right brands across Europe that cater to extremists. This is more than just an aesthetic issue, Cynthia Miller-Idriss, a sociologist at American University, argues: The images and language on the far-right clothing Miller-Idriss has catalogued, including &ldquo;desensitization to violence, valorization of violence, a dehumanization of victims&hellip;making fun of victims or playing on words,&rdquo; actually &ldquo;has the potential to socialize young people towards extremist ways of thinking,&rdquo; she told me.</p>\n<p>This &ldquo;valorization of violence&rdquo; is something that&rsquo;s targeted specifically at young men. Even the way clothes are displayed on far-right fashion websites, she says, promotes a hyper-masculine, violent image, with often heavily-tattooed, overly muscular men modeling the clothes. Miller-Idriss found that many of the young men she interviewed used a uniquely German word to describe the brands and the kinds of young men who wore them&mdash;<i>gewaltbereit</i>, meaning ready for violence.</p>\n<p>One way that the clothing socializes young men towards extremist thinking, according to Miller-Idriss, is through constant &ldquo;playfulness&rdquo; and game-playing with symbols. Even in countries with lax or no laws against wearing Nazi imagery in public, it&rsquo;s still not the most socially acceptable thing to stroll around in public with a swastika t-shirt. But the same can&rsquo;t be said for lesser-known symbols commonly used by white nationalists and neo-Nazis, for example the runic insignia once used by the SS.</p>\n<p>This game is on full display if you browse some of these brands&rsquo; websites. One popular Ukrainian brand, Svastone&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/facebook-nazi-clothing-extremism_us_5b5b5cb3e4b0fd5c73cf2986\">owned</a> by a musician in a neo-Nazi band&mdash;features a logo that could be an oddly drawn diamond, or could be a truncated swastika. A popular Russian brand, White Rex&mdash;founded by a notorious Russian neo-Nazi soccer hooligan&mdash;sells a shirt with an array of bombs that, when you look more closely, form the number 88.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see any swastikas or runes,&rdquo; White Rex founder Denis Nikitin <a href=\"https://www.vg.no/spesial/2017/det-hvite-raseriet/page/propagandaindustrien\">told</a> a Norwegian newspaper in 2017. &ldquo;They should be clothes that people are comfortable wearing around town and so that they can recognize each other.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This kind of deliberate ambiguity&mdash;a &ldquo;playfulness of potential interpretations,&rdquo; Miller-Idriss calls it&mdash;isn&rsquo;t just about skirting the lines between what&rsquo;s socially acceptable or legal. &ldquo;It gives them a sense of power,&rdquo; says Miller-Idriss. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to understand emotionally, that it&rsquo;s &lsquo;getting one over on the adults.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also, she said, &ldquo;one of multiple access points or gateways into far-right extremist scenes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Fashion bleeds into many other activities of the far right. The Italian neo-fascist CasaPound movement has a clothing label that&rsquo;s been <a href=\"http://www.italianinsider.it/?q=node/6727\">called</a> the &ldquo;commercial rib of CasaPound,&rdquo; helping finance some of its activities. Kiev-based Militant Zone not only sells t-shirts and CDs in a small shop just off the city&rsquo;s main square, but organized a neo-Nazi concert in December 2018 that featured &ldquo;Sieg Heil&rdquo; chants and Hitler salutes.</p>\n<p>Far-right fashion can also cross over into far-right violence. White Rex owner Denis Nikitin&mdash;also based in Kiev and working with the Azov movement&mdash;hosts far-right-linked mixed martial arts events across Europe where he promotes his White Rex brand and its openly white supremacist message; he also reportedly uses income from the brand to <a href=\"https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/10/12/16350612/white-rex-fascist-neo-nazi-groups-thrive-mma-promotions-clothing-brands-karim-zidan-mma-feature\">fund</a> far-right groups. Nikitin has also <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/robert-rundo-denis-nikitin-hooligans-europe-hate-group\">met</a> with members of the California-based white supremacist gang Rise Above Movement, whose leaders were arrested in 2018, and allegedly helped <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/02/the-terrifying-rise-of-alt-right-fight-clubs/\">train</a> far-right extremists in the UK.</p>\n<p>Will far-right fashion catch on in the U.S. like it has in Europe? To go by the photos from some far-right rallies, it already has, at least to a limited extent. It&rsquo;s certainly not hard for an American to order clothing from many of these European brands or shops online. Nor is the American far-right lacking for any sense of uniform fashion, as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proud_Boys\">Proud Boys</a>&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/07/10/the-alt-rights-proud-boys-love-fred-perry-polo-shirts-the-feeling-is-not-mutual/?utm_term=.fca9c8ea6f17\">co-opting of Fred Perry shirts</a> make clear. And there&rsquo;s surely no doubt that the United States could be a huge untapped market for European far-right brands.</p>\n<p>U.S. far-right fashion culture, however, could prove both less subtle and harder to regulate.</p>\n<p>American culture doesn&rsquo;t have the closetful of native extremist symbols that European far-right fashionistas have at their disposal. A number of symbols employed by Europe far-right fashion brands, Molnar explained, &ldquo;have been alternately used, embraced, tolerated, banned, later reconfigured and recycled by different regimes and have accumulated multiple layers of meaning.&rdquo; It gives them an ability to play coy with symbols, like runes appropriated by the SS. Aside from symbols like the Confederate flag or the Gadsden &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tread on me&rdquo; flag, Molnar pointed out, there&rsquo;s no well the American far-right can reach into to pull out similarly ambiguous or repurposed icons. In short, American symbols are more explicit, requiring less &ldquo;decoding&rdquo; to understand. The Klan hood is not exactly subtle. Instead, in the U.S., according to Miller-Idriss, most existing fashion that could be dubbed far right focuses on pro-veteran, pro-2<sup>nd</sup>-amendment and overtly Islamophobic themes.</p>\n<p>The option often tried in Germany&mdash;banning far-right clothing brands&mdash;won&rsquo;t work in most public places due to American free speech protections. Insofar as U.S. schools want to try it, though, there&rsquo;s a pretty clear lesson from abroad: The bans on their own aren&rsquo;t effective. &ldquo;They can even backfire and increase the appeal of the far-right by making clothing and symbols a space for easy rebellion and anti-authoritarian expression,&rdquo; Miller-Idriss said. What matters is the discussion: Many of the youth in Germany she interviewed where far-right brands like Thor Steinar were banned &ldquo;did not understand why certain brands are banned&rdquo;; to them &ldquo;it just seemed like one more arbitrary rule to follow.&rdquo; U.S. educators, she said, &ldquo;need to be clear with students and parents about what their thinking is about banning, what values are being defended and why.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Failing to have that conversation cedes ground to the far right by default. For, whether it&rsquo;s a Ukrainian store selling a shirt with the SS&rsquo;s <i>Totenkopf </i>(death&rsquo;s head) and the logo of British neo-Nazi terror group Combat 18, or an Italian brand with a picture of a motorcycle and the words &ldquo;BORN TO WIN: WHITE RACE,&rdquo; or a Hungarian shirt with the words &ldquo;Rise above democracy,&rdquo; the brains behind Europe&rsquo;s far-right fashion brands are perfectly clear about the kind of values they&rsquo;re defending.</p>",

                "text": "At first glance, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much out of the ordinary about them. A t-shirt showing a mountain and deer and the slogan \u201cRespect Nature.\u201d A black polo shirt with black, white, and red piping and a small circular logo. A sweater showing a child on a parent\u2019s shoulders at a soccer match, holding up a supporter\u2019s scarf, with \u201cKeep the Tradition\u201d underneath.\nBut look a bit closer. That symbol behind the deer? It\u2019s a black sun, a common neo-Nazi symbol adapted from a floor mosaic in Heinrich Himmler\u2019s SS Generals\u2019 Hall. That logo on the polo shirt? It looks like a broken sun cross-style swastika. And the child on his parent\u2019s back? He\u2019s got the number 88 on their back\u2014neo-Nazi code for \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s more where these came from. Far-right fashion in Europe has become a niche industry over the past decade. Brands big and small have given everyone from hardened neo-Nazis to young men flirting with the far-right subcultures a way to express themselves that doesn\u2019t fit neatly into what many think a far-right extremist is supposed to look like.\nBut it\u2019s hardly just about looking cool or tough, or playing coy little games with adults who aren\u2019t well-versed in the subtleties of fascist symbolism; far-right fashion can help extremist devotees, especially young men, build a stronger sense of belonging and brotherhood, and even act as a gateway to radicalization. And those who have their eyes on the far-right fashion scene in Europe think the U.S. is next.\nThe examples described above are hardly one-offs. The French brand with the \u201cRespect Nature\u201d shirt also sells shirts with \u201cHTLR\u201d in block letters with the official SS motto underneath. The Italian creators of the black-white-red polo shirt also sell sweaters bearing the letters \u201cWPWW,\u201d for \u201cWhite Pride World Wide.\u201d And a Ukrainian store that sells the \u201cKeep the Tradition\u201d sweater is selling tickets for a neo-Nazi concert this summer featuring a band whose former guitar player murdered six people in a hate crime at a Wisconsin Sikh temple in 2012.\nThe last decade has seen a number of far-right fashion brands make a name for themselves among Europe\u2019s far-right extremists. The most well-known of them, Germany\u2019s Thor Steinar, has been marketing itself to the far right for years. The multimillion-dollar company, now based in Dubai, has shops across Germany and online that sell t-shirts, sweaters and jackets bearing Nordic-themed imagery popular among devotees of the far-right, but also slogans like \u201cSave the White Continent.\u201d Thor Steinar\u2019s logo resembles a combination of two Nazi-era symbols, the T-rune and the Wolfsangel, that are themselves banned in Germany. The brand\u2019s clothing is also banned in a number of German schools, soccer stadiums, and even in Germany\u2019s lower house of parliament.\nWearing Thor Steinar or other far-right brands isn\u2019t just about looking cool. Fashion, says New School sociologist Virag Molnar, is an important way for individuals in far-right groups, especially young men, to form their identities and make a statement to each other and to those outside the group.\n\u201cUsing style to express and conspicuously display group identity and to make a political statement is integral to subcultures,\u201d Molnar told me by email. What\u2019s more, she adds, because members of far-right groups are often only infrequently connected face-to-face, with much of their interaction online, \u201ctheir like-mindedness and shared values can be (visibly) expressed and experienced through consumption.\u201d\nThis \u201cvalorization of violence\u201d is something that\u2019s targeted specifically at young men.\nThere\u2019s no shortage of relatively new far-right brands across Europe that cater to extremists. This is more than just an aesthetic issue, Cynthia Miller-Idriss, a sociologist at American University, argues: The images and language on the far-right clothing Miller-Idriss has catalogued, including \u201cdesensitization to violence, valorization of violence, a dehumanization of victims\u2026making fun of victims or playing on words,\u201d actually \u201chas the potential to socialize young people towards extremist ways of thinking,\u201d she told me.\nThis \u201cvalorization of violence\u201d is something that\u2019s targeted specifically at young men. Even the way clothes are displayed on far-right fashion websites, she says, promotes a hyper-masculine, violent image, with often heavily-tattooed, overly muscular men modeling the clothes. Miller-Idriss found that many of the young men she interviewed used a uniquely German word to describe the brands and the kinds of young men who wore them\u2014gewaltbereit, meaning ready for violence.\nOne way that the clothing socializes young men towards extremist thinking, according to Miller-Idriss, is through constant \u201cplayfulness\u201d and game-playing with symbols. Even in countries with lax or no laws against wearing Nazi imagery in public, it\u2019s still not the most socially acceptable thing to stroll around in public with a swastika t-shirt. But the same can\u2019t be said for lesser-known symbols commonly used by white nationalists and neo-Nazis, for example the runic insignia once used by the SS.\nThis game is on full display if you browse some of these brands\u2019 websites. One popular Ukrainian brand, Svastone\u2014owned by a musician in a neo-Nazi band\u2014features a logo that could be an oddly drawn diamond, or could be a truncated swastika. A popular Russian brand, White Rex\u2014founded by a notorious Russian neo-Nazi soccer hooligan\u2014sells a shirt with an array of bombs that, when you look more closely, form the number 88.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t see any swastikas or runes,\u201d White Rex founder Denis Nikitin told a Norwegian newspaper in 2017. \u201cThey should be clothes that people are comfortable wearing around town and so that they can recognize each other.\u201d\nThis kind of deliberate ambiguity\u2014a \u201cplayfulness of potential interpretations,\u201d Miller-Idriss calls it\u2014isn\u2019t just about skirting the lines between what\u2019s socially acceptable or legal. \u201cIt gives them a sense of power,\u201d says Miller-Idriss. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand emotionally, that it\u2019s \u2018getting one over on the adults.\u2019\u201d\nIt\u2019s also, she said, \u201cone of multiple access points or gateways into far-right extremist scenes.\u201d\nFashion bleeds into many other activities of the far right. The Italian neo-fascist CasaPound movement has a clothing label that\u2019s been called the \u201ccommercial rib of CasaPound,\u201d helping finance some of its activities. Kiev-based Militant Zone not only sells t-shirts and CDs in a small shop just off the city\u2019s main square, but organized a neo-Nazi concert in December 2018 that featured \u201cSieg Heil\u201d chants and Hitler salutes.\nFar-right fashion can also cross over into far-right violence. White Rex owner Denis Nikitin\u2014also based in Kiev and working with the Azov movement\u2014hosts far-right-linked mixed martial arts events across Europe where he promotes his White Rex brand and its openly white supremacist message; he also reportedly uses income from the brand to fund far-right groups. Nikitin has also met with members of the California-based white supremacist gang Rise Above Movement, whose leaders were arrested in 2018, and allegedly helped train far-right extremists in the UK.\nWill far-right fashion catch on in the U.S. like it has in Europe? To go by the photos from some far-right rallies, it already has, at least to a limited extent. It\u2019s certainly not hard for an American to order clothing from many of these European brands or shops online. Nor is the American far-right lacking for any sense of uniform fashion, as the Proud Boys\u2019 co-opting of Fred Perry shirts make clear. And there\u2019s surely no doubt that the United States could be a huge untapped market for European far-right brands.\nU.S. far-right fashion culture, however, could prove both less subtle and harder to regulate.\nAmerican culture doesn\u2019t have the closetful of native extremist symbols that European far-right fashionistas have at their disposal. A number of symbols employed by Europe far-right fashion brands, Molnar explained, \u201chave been alternately used, embraced, tolerated, banned, later reconfigured and recycled by different regimes and have accumulated multiple layers of meaning.\u201d It gives them an ability to play coy with symbols, like runes appropriated by the SS. Aside from symbols like the Confederate flag or the Gadsden \u201cDon\u2019t tread on me\u201d flag, Molnar pointed out, there\u2019s no well the American far-right can reach into to pull out similarly ambiguous or repurposed icons. In short, American symbols are more explicit, requiring less \u201cdecoding\u201d to understand. The Klan hood is not exactly subtle. Instead, in the U.S., according to Miller-Idriss, most existing fashion that could be dubbed far right focuses on pro-veteran, pro-2nd-amendment and overtly Islamophobic themes.\nThe option often tried in Germany\u2014banning far-right clothing brands\u2014won\u2019t work in most public places due to American free speech protections. Insofar as U.S. schools want to try it, though, there\u2019s a pretty clear lesson from abroad: The bans on their own aren\u2019t effective. \u201cThey can even backfire and increase the appeal of the far-right by making clothing and symbols a space for easy rebellion and anti-authoritarian expression,\u201d Miller-Idriss said. What matters is the discussion: Many of the youth in Germany she interviewed where far-right brands like Thor Steinar were banned \u201cdid not understand why certain brands are banned\u201d; to them \u201cit just seemed like one more arbitrary rule to follow.\u201d U.S. educators, she said, \u201cneed to be clear with students and parents about what their thinking is about banning, what values are being defended and why.\u201d\nFailing to have that conversation cedes ground to the far right by default. For, whether it\u2019s a Ukrainian store selling a shirt with the SS\u2019s Totenkopf (death\u2019s head) and the logo of British neo-Nazi terror group Combat 18, or an Italian brand with a picture of a motorcycle and the words \u201cBORN TO WIN: WHITE RACE,\u201d or a Hungarian shirt with the words \u201cRise above democracy,\u201d the brains behind Europe\u2019s far-right fashion brands are perfectly clear about the kind of values they\u2019re defending.",

The senator from New York didn&rsquo;t immediately specify which pledge she had taken, but it was obvious to those in attendance: Gillibrand had signed the <a href=\"http://nofossilfuelmoney.org/\">No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge,</a> promising not to accept any money from the oil, gas, or coal industries for her presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>She&rsquo;s not the first Democratic candidate to take the pledge. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, and Washington Governor Jay Inslee have all signed the document administered by the No Fossil Fuel Money coalition.* &ldquo;The bar for climate leadership is being set,&rdquo; David Turnbull, the strategic communications director of Oil Change United States, a member of the coalition, <a href=\"http://oilchangeusa.org/response-to-sen-gillibrand-signing-the-no-fossil-fuel-money-pledge/\">said</a> in a Friday statement. &ldquo;We look forward to more candidates joining this trend as the Presidential primary continues to ramp up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Senators Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris, Congressman Beto O&rsquo;Rourke, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg have not signed the pledge, <a href=\"http://nofossilfuelmoney.org/pledge-signers/\">according to its website</a>. None of these campaigns&rsquo; press teams responded to requests for comment, except for a spokesperson for Harris who said the senator technically complies with the pledge but hasn&rsquo;t actually signed it. That spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up asking why she doesn&rsquo;t just sign it then.</p>\n<p>The No Fossil Fuel Money pledge has long been the climate activist community&rsquo;s litmus test for political candidates. But as the dire nature of global warming becomes clearer by the day&mdash;and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s Green New Deal grows more popular&mdash;the climate activist community and the Democratic voter base are increasingly aligned on the issue. Signing the pledge should be one of the easiest commitments the Democratic candidates have to make, and those who don&rsquo;t may well be dooming their chances.</p>\n<p>Refusing money from the oil, gas and coal industries may seem, at first glance, like a politically risky move. If the eventual Democratic nominee is to beat Donald Trump&mdash;the most likely eventual Republican nominee&mdash;they&rsquo;ll need all the resources they can get. So why give up such a potentially huge source of revenue?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The fossil fuel industry doesn&rsquo;t generally have a major role in presidential elections on the Democratic side, and hasn&rsquo;t for awhile,&rdquo; said Sarah Bryner, the research director at the Center for Responsive Politics. Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, only got about $1 million from oil and gas interests over the course of her campaign; Barack Obama received about the same amount in 2008 and 2012, respectively. That&rsquo;s a fairly minuscule amount, given that Clinton&rsquo;s campaign raised <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2016-presidential-campaign-fundraising/\">about a $1 billion</a> and Obama&rsquo;s 2012 campaign <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/barack-obama-mitt-romney-both-topped-1-billion-in-2012-084737\">raised even more</a>. Even a Democratic candidate like O&rsquo;Rourke, who&rsquo;s historically benefitted from oil and gas industry money, wouldn&rsquo;t be giving up that much if he gave it up in 2020. As a congressman in 2018, he received $476,000 from the industry, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=E01++\">second only to Senator Ted Cruz</a> in all of Congress. But O&rsquo;Rourke <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/us/politics/beto-o-rourke-fundraising.html\">raised</a> $6 million online in the first 24 hours of his campaign alone.</p>\n<p>So the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge isn&rsquo;t very costly for Democrats. (The No Hollywood Celebrity Money Pledge would be another story.) And any money a Democratic candidate gives up by signing is more than offset by the credibility they&rsquo;d earn on the issue of climate change&mdash;not to mention that it might attract big-money environmental donors. The eventual Democratic nominee surely will be expected to champion the Green New Deal, or a similar plan to transition the country&rsquo;s fossil fuel economy into a renewable one. Democratic voters ought to be able trust that their nominee isn&rsquo;t corrupted by the very industries that are making the planet unlivable.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-presidential-candidates.html\">Democratic field</a> is large, and nearly every candidate has made a grand statement or two about the dire threat of global warming. But right now, voters can truly trust only five of them to decarbonize the economy. Bryner expects that to change, eventually. &ldquo;This is a signaling game, and it ends up punishing candidates who won&rsquo;t make the same pledges,&rdquo; she said. Hopefully it does&mdash;because if the next president doesn&rsquo;t have the guts to stand up to the fossil fuel industry, then they certainly don&rsquo;t have what it takes to prevent a world of hurt.</p>\n<p>* <i>A previous version of this article misstated the organization that is administering the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge</i>.</p>",

                "text": "Two days before she officially launched her campaign for president, Kirsten Gillibrand made one of the smartest moves of her political career. \u201cI signed the pledge today,\u201d she told a group of climate change activists in New Hampshire on Friday. The senator from New York didn\u2019t immediately specify which pledge she had taken, but it was obvious to those in attendance: Gillibrand had signed the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge, promising not to accept any money from the oil, gas, or coal industries for her presidential campaign.\nShe\u2019s not the first Democratic candidate to take the pledge. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, and Washington Governor Jay Inslee have all signed the document administered by the No Fossil Fuel Money coalition.* \u201cThe bar for climate leadership is being set,\u201d David Turnbull, the strategic communications director of Oil Change United States, a member of the coalition, said in a Friday statement. \u201cWe look forward to more candidates joining this trend as the Presidential primary continues to ramp up.\u201d\nSenators Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris, Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg have not signed the pledge, according to its website. None of these campaigns\u2019 press teams responded to requests for comment, except for a spokesperson for Harris who said the senator technically complies with the pledge but hasn\u2019t actually signed it. That spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up asking why she doesn\u2019t just sign it then.\nThe No Fossil Fuel Money pledge has long been the climate activist community\u2019s litmus test for political candidates. But as the dire nature of global warming becomes clearer by the day\u2014and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal grows more popular\u2014the climate activist community and the Democratic voter base are increasingly aligned on the issue. Signing the pledge should be one of the easiest commitments the Democratic candidates have to make, and those who don\u2019t may well be dooming their chances.\nRefusing money from the oil, gas and coal industries may seem, at first glance, like a politically risky move. If the eventual Democratic nominee is to beat Donald Trump\u2014the most likely eventual Republican nominee\u2014they\u2019ll need all the resources they can get. So why give up such a potentially huge source of revenue?\n\u201cThe fossil fuel industry doesn\u2019t generally have a major role in presidential elections on the Democratic side, and hasn\u2019t for awhile,\u201d said Sarah Bryner, the research director at the Center for Responsive Politics. Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, only got about $1 million from oil and gas interests over the course of her campaign; Barack Obama received about the same amount in 2008 and 2012, respectively. That\u2019s a fairly minuscule amount, given that Clinton\u2019s campaign raised about a $1 billion and Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign raised even more. Even a Democratic candidate like O\u2019Rourke, who\u2019s historically benefitted from oil and gas industry money, wouldn\u2019t be giving up that much if he gave it up in 2020. As a congressman in 2018, he received $476,000 from the industry, second only to Senator Ted Cruz in all of Congress. But O\u2019Rourke raised $6 million online in the first 24 hours of his campaign alone.\nSo the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge isn\u2019t very costly for Democrats. (The No Hollywood Celebrity Money Pledge would be another story.) And any money a Democratic candidate gives up by signing is more than offset by the credibility they\u2019d earn on the issue of climate change\u2014not to mention that it might attract big-money environmental donors. The eventual Democratic nominee surely will be expected to champion the Green New Deal, or a similar plan to transition the country\u2019s fossil fuel economy into a renewable one. Democratic voters ought to be able trust that their nominee isn\u2019t corrupted by the very industries that are making the planet unlivable.\nThe Democratic field is large, and nearly every candidate has made a grand statement or two about the dire threat of global warming. But right now, voters can truly trust only five of them to decarbonize the economy. Bryner expects that to change, eventually. \u201cThis is a signaling game, and it ends up punishing candidates who won\u2019t make the same pledges,\u201d she said. Hopefully it does\u2014because if the next president doesn\u2019t have the guts to stand up to the fossil fuel industry, then they certainly don\u2019t have what it takes to prevent a world of hurt.\n* A previous version of this article misstated the organization that is administering the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge.",

Last week&rsquo;s three-day voting spree in the House of Commons was the culmination of a two-year effort by the U.K.&rsquo;s government and Parliament to extract the country from the European Union, to &ldquo;take back control,&rdquo; as the Leave campaign slogan promised. Yet those votes&mdash;rejecting the prime minister&rsquo;s Brexit deal Tuesday, rejecting both the option of a no-deal Brexit <i>and </i>the option of a second referendum on Wednesday, and voting to delay exit Thursday&mdash;demonstrated that neither the ruling party nor any other parliamentary faction commands the majority to do that in practice. In fact, the only tangible outcome of the last week has been, ironically, to shift control of Brexit&rsquo;s fate to the EU.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons the U.K. finds itself in this situation is that it was not clear from the start who <i>should</i> have gained control as a result of Brexit. Theresa May&rsquo;s government assumed the task of implementing the referendum&rsquo;s result lay with the executive. Their plan was to trigger Article 50 of the EU Treaty&mdash;the legal process by which an EU member state initiates the withdrawal process&mdash;without consulting the legislative branch, Parliament. That seemed to make a mockery of the very value over which the U.K.&rsquo;s departure from the EU was fought in the first place: parliamentary sovereignty. The challenge to May&rsquo;s plans didn&rsquo;t come from the Commons, but from a civilian, Gina Miller, who took the government to court and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/24/supreme-court-brexit-judgment-constitution-gina-miller\">won</a>. As a result, Parliament had to debate and vote on whether it approved the initiation of the U.K.&rsquo;s exit from the EU. The bill passed <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38833883\">comfortably</a> in February 2017 but set a precedent: The government couldn&rsquo;t simply do as it pleased when it came to Brexit terms&mdash;it had to get Parliamentary approval. May had to promise Parliament a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-01-06/brexit-what-is-the-meaningful-vote-and-how-does-it-work/\">meaningful vote</a>,&rdquo; i.e. a vote on the government&rsquo;s final withdrawal agreement with the EU. It is this meaningful vote that May has been trying, and failing, to win since she struck her deal with the EU back in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/14/theresa-mays-brexit-deal-everything-you-need-to-know\">November</a>.</p>\n<p>Last Tuesday, May&rsquo;s withdrawal deal was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47547887\">defeated</a> in Parliament by 149 votes, only two weeks ahead of the U.K.&rsquo;s scheduled March 29 departure date. It was a better result than January&rsquo;s, (when a near identical deal was rejected by the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-vote-theresa-may-defeat-mps-history-biggest-ever-loss-commons-a8729791.html\">greatest margin</a> in modern parliamentary history) but still nowhere near a majority. It appears as though the Prime Minister has lost control of Brexit, her government&rsquo;s main preoccupation, and that Parliament has taken over. But things are never that simple when it comes to Brexit. Parliament is divided in different factions, aiming for different outcomes, yet without the power to bring any of those outcomes about.</p>\n<p>A group of ultra-Euroskeptic Conservative MPs, the European Research Group (ERG), are opposed to May&rsquo;s deal because of the so-called backstop, a provision that avoids the creation of a hard border between Northern Ireland (part of the U.K.) and the Republic of Ireland (part of the EU) as a result of Brexit. The absence of such a border is integral to the Good Friday Agreement which ended decades of violence between the two countries, but hardcore Brexiteers don&rsquo;t like the idea of keeping Northern Ireland (and, by extension, the U.K.) in a European customs union to fulfill that requirement. Instead, the <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/general-election/brexit-erg-and-dup-refuse-to-back-theresa-may-s-deal-1-4887886\">ERG</a> favors a so-called &ldquo;no-deal Brexit&rdquo; wherein the U.K. leaves the European Union without any arrangements in place. The option is predicted to lead to severe economic disruption, but prominent Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson has called it the only way that the country&rsquo;s self-respect can be <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/03/boris-johnson-leaving-on-29-march-is-the-only-way-to-preserve-the-uks-self-respect/\">preserved</a>. The DUP, a Northern Irish party propping up May&rsquo;s minority government, has also taken this <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47586694\">position</a>. No-deal is still legally the default if the U.K. can&rsquo;t come up with a deal before the deadline, so the ERG and DUP are hoping that by blocking May&rsquo;s deal, no-deal becomes more likely. The majority of Parliament, however, finds a no-deal Brexit unacceptable, and last Wednesday voted to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47562995\">rule it out</a> as an outcome.</p>\n<p>As demonstrations of sovereignty go, this is functionally meaningless: To actually avoid a no-deal default, Parliament must either vote through <i>some</i> withdrawal agreement or stop Brexit altogether. At the moment, there is no majority for either of those alternatives. Or if there is, we don&rsquo;t know it, as the option of holding &ldquo;indicative votes&rdquo; to find a majority for an alternative path was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/14/brexit-mps-to-vote-on-delaying-departure-from-european-union-politics-live\">rejected</a>, thus preserving a shroud of mystery over how the people&rsquo;s elected representatives think Brexit should be resolved.</p>\n<p>Parliament, then, is no more in control of Brexit than the prime minister is. A natural way of resolving this impasse would be to hold a second referendum, giving the people that voted for Brexit in the first place the power to decide what should happen next, but this too has been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-47575445/mps-reject-a-second-brexit-referendum-by-334-votes-to-85\">defeated</a> in last week&rsquo;s votes.</p>\n<p>Given the impasse and looming Brexit deadline on the 29th of March, Parliament came together in agreeing to ask the EU for an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/uk-politics-parliaments-47529293\">extension</a>. That essentially gives the EU control over the next stages of Brexit&mdash;something it will likely decide at the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46393399\">EU summit</a> later this week. To begin with, all other 27 EU members must agree to the U.K.&rsquo;s request. In all probability they will, despite concerns that no-deal zealots have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/13/brexiters-lobby-for-european-veto-of-article-50-extension\">lobbying</a> countries like Italy and Poland to veto the extension. But what will truly determine Brexit&rsquo;s future is the length of the extension the EU will agree to. The British government will have to offer reasons why more time can facilitate Parliament&rsquo;s approving a withdrawal deal. Theresa May favors a short extension, but it&rsquo;s hard to see the justification for it. It is unlikely that substantial enough changes can be made to the prime minister&rsquo;s current deal in a short time frame&mdash;the speaker of the House warned on Monday that a third meaningful vote on a lightly tweaked version of May&rsquo;s plan would violate <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47614074\">parliamentary convention</a>. A short extension would also not allow time for other avenues, like a second referendum or a general election, to become available. If the EU favors a longer extension instead, as Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47557216\">hinted</a>, all bets are off. The U.K. will have to participate in the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/01/17/extending-article-50-may-mean-britain-must-elect-meps-again\">European Parliament elections</a> in May, whose results could create a new political dynamic, including the possibility of a general election or a second referendum giving Brexit a whole new direction. That longer extension, then, would grant the U.K. more autonomy and options about how to proceed.</p>\n<p>Autonomy was indeed one of the reasons the U.K. voted to leave the EU in the first place. Ironically, that freedom is now dependent on the EU granting it.</p>",

                "text": "Brexit so far has been a story of the United Kingdom\u2019s political class losing its authority. Last week\u2019s three-day voting spree in the House of Commons was the culmination of a two-year effort by the U.K.\u2019s government and Parliament to extract the country from the European Union, to \u201ctake back control,\u201d as the Leave campaign slogan promised. Yet those votes\u2014rejecting the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal Tuesday, rejecting both the option of a no-deal Brexit and the option of a second referendum on Wednesday, and voting to delay exit Thursday\u2014demonstrated that neither the ruling party nor any other parliamentary faction commands the majority to do that in practice. In fact, the only tangible outcome of the last week has been, ironically, to shift control of Brexit\u2019s fate to the EU.\nOne of the reasons the U.K. finds itself in this situation is that it was not clear from the start who should have gained control as a result of Brexit. Theresa May\u2019s government assumed the task of implementing the referendum\u2019s result lay with the executive. Their plan was to trigger Article 50 of the EU Treaty\u2014the legal process by which an EU member state initiates the withdrawal process\u2014without consulting the legislative branch, Parliament. That seemed to make a mockery of the very value over which the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU was fought in the first place: parliamentary sovereignty. The challenge to May\u2019s plans didn\u2019t come from the Commons, but from a civilian, Gina Miller, who took the government to court and won. As a result, Parliament had to debate and vote on whether it approved the initiation of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU. The bill passed comfortably in February 2017 but set a precedent: The government couldn\u2019t simply do as it pleased when it came to Brexit terms\u2014it had to get Parliamentary approval. May had to promise Parliament a \u201cmeaningful vote,\u201d i.e. a vote on the government\u2019s final withdrawal agreement with the EU. It is this meaningful vote that May has been trying, and failing, to win since she struck her deal with the EU back in November.\nLast Tuesday, May\u2019s withdrawal deal was defeated in Parliament by 149 votes, only two weeks ahead of the U.K.\u2019s scheduled March 29 departure date. It was a better result than January\u2019s, (when a near identical deal was rejected by the greatest margin in modern parliamentary history) but still nowhere near a majority. It appears as though the Prime Minister has lost control of Brexit, her government\u2019s main preoccupation, and that Parliament has taken over. But things are never that simple when it comes to Brexit. Parliament is divided in different factions, aiming for different outcomes, yet without the power to bring any of those outcomes about.\nA group of ultra-Euroskeptic Conservative MPs, the European Research Group (ERG), are opposed to May\u2019s deal because of the so-called backstop, a provision that avoids the creation of a hard border between Northern Ireland (part of the U.K.) and the Republic of Ireland (part of the EU) as a result of Brexit. The absence of such a border is integral to the Good Friday Agreement which ended decades of violence between the two countries, but hardcore Brexiteers don\u2019t like the idea of keeping Northern Ireland (and, by extension, the U.K.) in a European customs union to fulfill that requirement. Instead, the ERG favors a so-called \u201cno-deal Brexit\u201d wherein the U.K. leaves the European Union without any arrangements in place. The option is predicted to lead to severe economic disruption, but prominent Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson has called it the only way that the country\u2019s self-respect can be preserved. The DUP, a Northern Irish party propping up May\u2019s minority government, has also taken this position. No-deal is still legally the default if the U.K. can\u2019t come up with a deal before the deadline, so the ERG and DUP are hoping that by blocking May\u2019s deal, no-deal becomes more likely. The majority of Parliament, however, finds a no-deal Brexit unacceptable, and last Wednesday voted to rule it out as an outcome.\nAs demonstrations of sovereignty go, this is functionally meaningless: To actually avoid a no-deal default, Parliament must either vote through some withdrawal agreement or stop Brexit altogether. At the moment, there is no majority for either of those alternatives. Or if there is, we don\u2019t know it, as the option of holding \u201cindicative votes\u201d to find a majority for an alternative path was rejected, thus preserving a shroud of mystery over how the people\u2019s elected representatives think Brexit should be resolved.\nParliament, then, is no more in control of Brexit than the prime minister is. A natural way of resolving this impasse would be to hold a second referendum, giving the people that voted for Brexit in the first place the power to decide what should happen next, but this too has been defeated in last week\u2019s votes.\nGiven the impasse and looming Brexit deadline on the 29th of March, Parliament came together in agreeing to ask the EU for an extension. That essentially gives the EU control over the next stages of Brexit\u2014something it will likely decide at the EU summit later this week. To begin with, all other 27 EU members must agree to the U.K.\u2019s request. In all probability they will, despite concerns that no-deal zealots have been lobbying countries like Italy and Poland to veto the extension. But what will truly determine Brexit\u2019s future is the length of the extension the EU will agree to. The British government will have to offer reasons why more time can facilitate Parliament\u2019s approving a withdrawal deal. Theresa May favors a short extension, but it\u2019s hard to see the justification for it. It is unlikely that substantial enough changes can be made to the prime minister\u2019s current deal in a short time frame\u2014the speaker of the House warned on Monday that a third meaningful vote on a lightly tweaked version of May\u2019s plan would violate parliamentary convention. A short extension would also not allow time for other avenues, like a second referendum or a general election, to become available. If the EU favors a longer extension instead, as Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, has hinted, all bets are off. The U.K. will have to participate in the European Parliament elections in May, whose results could create a new political dynamic, including the possibility of a general election or a second referendum giving Brexit a whole new direction. That longer extension, then, would grant the U.K. more autonomy and options about how to proceed.\nAutonomy was indeed one of the reasons the U.K. voted to leave the EU in the first place. Ironically, that freedom is now dependent on the EU granting it.",

Another first-term representative from California, Harley Rouda said that &ldquo;while Steve King&rsquo;s views don&rsquo;t represent the entire Republican Party, those on the far left of the Democratic Party do not represent the mainstream caucus.&rdquo; Stuart E. Eizenstat, an adviser in the Carter administration, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/16/democrats-civil-war-225811\">wrote</a> in <i>Politico Magazine</i> that he&rsquo;s twice &ldquo;watched pressure from the party&rsquo;s liberal wing tear the party apart and bring down a Democratic presidential candidate,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;Today, I fear it could all be happening again.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This is an age-old wail. For decades, Democrats have been telling themselves that there exists a liberal cliff: Move too far to the left and they&rsquo;ll fall off it, handing the country to an increasingly draconian Republican Party and dooming the Democrats to years in the political wilderness. Thus, when out of power, they inevitably tack toward the center when out of power, ever fearful of being labeled tax-and-spend liberals or, god forbid, socialists.</p>\n<p>The Democratic Party of the past half-century has been defined largely by this timidity. Now here comes a crop of fearless left-wing politicians, from first-term congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar to septuagenarian Senator Bernie Sanders, whose fearless policies are generating much of the excitement among the rank-and-file. For the party to turn its back on them, out of certainty that history will repeat itself&mdash;now <i>that</i> would be blowing it.</p>\n<p>The Democrats&rsquo; centrist Cassandras invariably point to four presidential elections&mdash;two losses and two victories&mdash;to buttress their argument.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/16/democrats-civil-war-225811\">1968</a>, intraparty fighting over the Vietnam War, and lingering anger over the party&rsquo;s embrace of civil rights, allegedly cost Democrats the White House. In this telling, the left wing&rsquo;s refusal to embrace Vice President Hubert Humphrey because of the Johnson administration&rsquo;s Vietnam policy played into Richard Nixon&rsquo;s hands, leading to Tricky Dick&rsquo;s criminal presidency and five more years of war. In <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/jimmy-carter-warns-democrats-don-t-veer-too-far-left-n908771\">1980</a>, Ted Kennedy&rsquo;s primary challenge of Jimmy Carter over universal health care may have mortally wounded Carter, leading to twelve years of deregulation, callousness, and misery.</p>\n<p>Bill Clinton retook the White House for Democrats&mdash;and held it for two terms&mdash;while pushing decidedly centrist policies: deregulation, welfare reform, crime bills, and above all, triangulation, a political approach purporting to merge the best of Republican and Democratic approaches to governance. After another spell in the wilderness <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore\">thanks to the Supreme Court&rsquo;s</a> <i>Bush </i>v.<i> Gore </i>decision, Democrats retook power in the late 2000s thanks to moderate candidates.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s tremendous agreement and awareness that getting the majority and running over the left cliff is what our Republican opponents would dearly love,&rdquo; Ellen Tauscher, at the time the chairman of the conservative New Democrat coalition, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/30/world/americas/30iht-dems.3329881.html\">told</a> <i>The New York Times</i> in 2006 about the party&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NJUP9I/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1\">midterm strategy</a>. &ldquo;And that is a compunction that we&rsquo;ve got to fight.&rdquo; Two years later, Barack Obama won the White House, thanks in part to <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/2008/11/05/inside-obamas-sweeping-victory/\">backing</a> from political moderates, who supported him in large numbers. Though Obama campaigned to the left of Bill Clinton, he governed largely as a moderate, especially on the economy, national security, and health care.</p>\n<p>All of this leads many to conclude that a simple calculus governs political power in America: When Democrats move to the center, they win; when they move to the left, Republicans do. So it&rsquo;s no wonder that, given all the talk of Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, some Democrats are once again pleading for moderation.</p>\n<p>Perhaps thinking of his own battle with Ted Kennedy, Carter has <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/jimmy-carter-warns-democrats-don-t-veer-too-far-left-n908771\">counseled</a> Democrats to focus on independents rather than progressives. &ldquo;Independents need to know they can invest their vote in the Democratic Party,&rdquo; Carter told an audience at his presidential library in September, going on to caution that consequences would follow were they to &ldquo;move to a very liberal program, like universal health care.&rdquo; Although the party picked up 40 seats in a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2018-midterm-elections-democrats-won-house-biggest-margin-a56a1049-8823-4667-8d81-2c67ef3f36f4.html\">landslide</a> midterm election, the amount of attention given to new progressive policies, like Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/07/691997301/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-releases-green-new-deal-outline\">Green New Deal</a>, Sanders&rsquo;s Medicare for All, and Elizabeth Warren&rsquo;s wealth tax and anti-trust plans, continues to make Democrats apprehensive.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re caught in a lose-lose because the activists are completely paying attention to Alexandria. And so if we aren&rsquo;t supporting it, then we&rsquo;re seen as bad Democrats,&rdquo; Hill, the Democratic congresswoman from California, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/15/house-democrats-moderates-2020-aoc-1220643\">told</a> <i>Politico</i>. &ldquo;But if we do support it, then that&rsquo;s going to be damaging to our campaigns.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s the solution to this bind? Delaware Senator Chris Coons <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/us/politics/bernie-sanders-2020-election-democrats.html?module=inline\">told</a> <i>The New York Times </i>it was to be &ldquo;hopeful, optimistic, positive.&rdquo; Third-term Pennsylvania Congressman Brendan Boyle <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/us/politics/bernie-sanders-2020-election-democrats.html?module=inline\">said</a> &ldquo;there&rsquo;s still lots of folks on our side who are O.K. with compromise,&rdquo; pointing to the many center-left Democrats who won seats in the midterm elections. Above all, the answer appears to be to keep quiet about specifics, as Beto O&rsquo;Rourke <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/153324/profound-emptiness-beto-orourke\">has done</a>, distancing oneself from universalist programs like Medicare for All and instead speaking in vague generalities about access and affordability. A fear of appearing too liberal has led these and other Democrats to be wary of standing for anything.</p>\n<p>But the Democratic Party is moving left, whether they like it or not. Forty-six percent of Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters now <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/wide-gender-gap-growing-educational-divide-in-voters-party-identification/\">identify</a> as &ldquo;liberal,&rdquo; up from just 28 percent a decade ago. At the same time, the percentage of people identifying as &ldquo;moderates&rdquo; has fallen from 44 to 37. When Obama was elected, one could accurately describe the Democratic base as being moderate, but that&rsquo;s no longer true anymore. As <i>The Atlantic</i>&rsquo;s David Graham <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/11/democratic-voters-move-leftward-range-issues/574834/\">wrote</a> last year, registered Democrats have become more liberal on immigration, economics, and race over the same period. Increasing <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/8/18171932/tax-public-opinion-alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">taxes</a> on the rich, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/28/most-americans-now-support-medicare-for-all-and-free-college-tuition.html\">Medicare for All</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-jobs-guarantee-democrats-polling_us_5b8ff651e4b0162f47292774\">jobs guarantee</a> all poll well today.</p>\n<p>Democrats did not gain their current momentum by being timid, but by relentlessly criticizing the president and advancing bold new ideas. Trump is the most consistently unpopular president in recent American history, and is underwater in the polls in key primary states. His approval rating may worsen yet after special counsel Robert Mueller releases his report and House Democrats&rsquo; investigations begin to bear fruit.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s true that the sky is falling&mdash;just not on the Democrats.</p>",

                "text": "The Democrats are about to blow it.\nThat\u2019s the emerging consensus of the party\u2019s moderates, anyway. Every week brings a new Politico story in which Democrats grouse about the party\u2019s resurgent left wing, warning that its pie-in-the-sky proposals and heterodox rhetoric threaten to squander the party\u2019s hard-earned electoral momentum under President Trump.\n\u201cAs we run up to this presidential [election], we need to show that Democrats, as a whole, are not socialists,\u201d said California Representative Katie Hill, who flipped a longtime Republican district last year. Another first-term representative from California, Harley Rouda said that \u201cwhile Steve King\u2019s views don\u2019t represent the entire Republican Party, those on the far left of the Democratic Party do not represent the mainstream caucus.\u201d Stuart E. Eizenstat, an adviser in the Carter administration, wrote in Politico Magazine that he\u2019s twice \u201cwatched pressure from the party\u2019s liberal wing tear the party apart and bring down a Democratic presidential candidate,\u201d adding, \u201cToday, I fear it could all be happening again.\u201d\nThis is an age-old wail. For decades, Democrats have been telling themselves that there exists a liberal cliff: Move too far to the left and they\u2019ll fall off it, handing the country to an increasingly draconian Republican Party and dooming the Democrats to years in the political wilderness. Thus, when out of power, they inevitably tack toward the center when out of power, ever fearful of being labeled tax-and-spend liberals or, god forbid, socialists.\nThe Democratic Party of the past half-century has been defined largely by this timidity. Now here comes a crop of fearless left-wing politicians, from first-term congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar to septuagenarian Senator Bernie Sanders, whose fearless policies are generating much of the excitement among the rank-and-file. For the party to turn its back on them, out of certainty that history will repeat itself\u2014now that would be blowing it.\nThe Democrats\u2019 centrist Cassandras invariably point to four presidential elections\u2014two losses and two victories\u2014to buttress their argument.\nIn 1968, intraparty fighting over the Vietnam War, and lingering anger over the party\u2019s embrace of civil rights, allegedly cost Democrats the White House. In this telling, the left wing\u2019s refusal to embrace Vice President Hubert Humphrey because of the Johnson administration\u2019s Vietnam policy played into Richard Nixon\u2019s hands, leading to Tricky Dick\u2019s criminal presidency and five more years of war. In 1980, Ted Kennedy\u2019s primary challenge of Jimmy Carter over universal health care may have mortally wounded Carter, leading to twelve years of deregulation, callousness, and misery.\nBill Clinton retook the White House for Democrats\u2014and held it for two terms\u2014while pushing decidedly centrist policies: deregulation, welfare reform, crime bills, and above all, triangulation, a political approach purporting to merge the best of Republican and Democratic approaches to governance. After another spell in the wilderness thanks to the Supreme Court\u2019s Bush v. Gore decision, Democrats retook power in the late 2000s thanks to moderate candidates.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s tremendous agreement and awareness that getting the majority and running over the left cliff is what our Republican opponents would dearly love,\u201d Ellen Tauscher, at the time the chairman of the conservative New Democrat coalition, told The New York Times in 2006 about the party\u2019s midterm strategy. \u201cAnd that is a compunction that we\u2019ve got to fight.\u201d Two years later, Barack Obama won the White House, thanks in part to backing from political moderates, who supported him in large numbers. Though Obama campaigned to the left of Bill Clinton, he governed largely as a moderate, especially on the economy, national security, and health care.\nAll of this leads many to conclude that a simple calculus governs political power in America: When Democrats move to the center, they win; when they move to the left, Republicans do. So it\u2019s no wonder that, given all the talk of Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, some Democrats are once again pleading for moderation.\nPerhaps thinking of his own battle with Ted Kennedy, Carter has counseled Democrats to focus on independents rather than progressives. \u201cIndependents need to know they can invest their vote in the Democratic Party,\u201d Carter told an audience at his presidential library in September, going on to caution that consequences would follow were they to \u201cmove to a very liberal program, like universal health care.\u201d Although the party picked up 40 seats in a landslide midterm election, the amount of attention given to new progressive policies, like Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal, Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All, and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax and anti-trust plans, continues to make Democrats apprehensive.\n\u201cWe\u2019re caught in a lose-lose because the activists are completely paying attention to Alexandria. And so if we aren\u2019t supporting it, then we\u2019re seen as bad Democrats,\u201d Hill, the Democratic congresswoman from California, told Politico. \u201cBut if we do support it, then that\u2019s going to be damaging to our campaigns.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the solution to this bind? Delaware Senator Chris Coons told The New York Times it was to be \u201chopeful, optimistic, positive.\u201d Third-term Pennsylvania Congressman Brendan Boyle said \u201cthere\u2019s still lots of folks on our side who are O.K. with compromise,\u201d pointing to the many center-left Democrats who won seats in the midterm elections. Above all, the answer appears to be to keep quiet about specifics, as Beto O\u2019Rourke has done, distancing oneself from universalist programs like Medicare for All and instead speaking in vague generalities about access and affordability. A fear of appearing too liberal has led these and other Democrats to be wary of standing for anything.\nBut the Democratic Party is moving left, whether they like it or not. Forty-six percent of Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters now identify as \u201cliberal,\u201d up from just 28 percent a decade ago. At the same time, the percentage of people identifying as \u201cmoderates\u201d has fallen from 44 to 37. When Obama was elected, one could accurately describe the Democratic base as being moderate, but that\u2019s no longer true anymore. As The Atlantic\u2019s David Graham wrote last year, registered Democrats have become more liberal on immigration, economics, and race over the same period. Increasing taxes on the rich, Medicare for All, and a jobs guarantee all poll well today.\nDemocrats did not gain their current momentum by being timid, but by relentlessly criticizing the president and advancing bold new ideas. Trump is the most consistently unpopular president in recent American history, and is underwater in the polls in key primary states. His approval rating may worsen yet after special counsel Robert Mueller releases his report and House Democrats\u2019 investigations begin to bear fruit.\nIt\u2019s true that the sky is falling\u2014just not on the Democrats.",

Thousands of journalists across the globe tore into its contents, seeking the causes behind the slaughter. The manifesto was littered with memes gleaned from the white-supremacist internet, and some journalists urged colleagues not steeped in the argot of that subculture to tread cautiously. Kevin Roose, a veteran of the deeps of the internet, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/technology/facebook-youtube-christchurch-shooting.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fkevin-roose&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection\">called</a> the manifesto &ldquo;a booby trap, a joke designed to ensnare unsuspecting people and members of the media into taking it too literally.&rdquo; The murders, he said, were &ldquo;produced entirely within the irony-soaked discourse of modern extremism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This analysis was echoed by the venerable internet forensics analysts at Bellingcat: &ldquo;This manifesto is a trap itself, laid for journalists searching for meaning behind this horrific crime,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/rest-of-world/2019/03/15/shitposting-inspirational-terrorism-and-the-christchurch-mosque-massacre/\">wrote</a> Robert Evans. &ldquo;The entire manifesto is dotted, liberally, with references to memes and internet in-jokes that only the extremely online would get.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s true that the manifesto contained references to memes that would have been familiar to the murderer&rsquo;s online compatriots. The alleged killer, 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant, claimed that &ldquo;Spyro the dragon 3 taught me ethno-nationalism&rdquo;&mdash;an ironic reference to a wholesome game about a purple dragon. In claiming that Candace Owens, a conservative commentator for far-right student group Turning Point USA, helped to teach him &ldquo;violence over meekness,&rdquo; he was probably not being serious; rather, he was seeking to capitalize on tensions between that group and both the far-right and left.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to treat Tarrant&rsquo;s story as a cautionary tale of irony gone too far&mdash;until even life and death are a joke, to be viewed at a numb remove. It&rsquo;s tempting to tell a story of a warped humor that grows edgier and edgier, more and more offensive, until its practitioners fall off the edge, into real racism and real violence. It&rsquo;s tempting, in other words, to emphasize the online elements of the attack&mdash;to posit that a sick internet culture has combined with fascist thought to produce a hybrid more monstrous than anything we&rsquo;ve seen before.</p>\n<p>But besides the document&rsquo;s winks at the slang-riddled discussions of far-right message boards, the manifesto is far from ironic. In fact, for much of its eighty-odd pages, it is a deadly serious screed, promulgating some of white power&rsquo;s grounding myths and showcasing its most violent consequences. What it reveals is a familiar enemy that, for entirely pragmatic and propagandistic reasons, has dressed itself up in memetic ephemera.</p>\n<p>Much of the manifesto&mdash;which begins with the line, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the birthrates,&rdquo; repeated three times&mdash;is fixated on reproduction, a classic preoccupation of white supremacist ideology. The author writes about his fear and rage at the thought of &ldquo;invaders&rdquo;&mdash;anyone nonwhite, but particularly Muslims&mdash;outbreeding &ldquo;Europeans.&rdquo; He claims, baselessly, that Muslims have preternaturally high birth-rates, and that the disparity between white and nonwhite births will lead to the crisis named in the manifesto&rsquo;s title: the &ldquo;Great Replacement,&rdquo; an ethnic, cultural, and racial erasure. The theory was promulgated by the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/new-zealand-suspect-inspired-by-far-right-french-intellectual-who-feared-nonwhite-immigration/2019/03/15/8c39fba4-6201-4a8d-99c6-aa42db53d6d3_story.html?utm_term=.0788da33ee36\">French racist ideologue Renaud Camus</a> in a 2012 book of the same name; since then, it has spread through an international network of white supremacists.</p>\n<p>From its very first page, the manifesto proclaims its ideology in screaming capital letters: &ldquo;THIS IS WHITE GENOCIDE.&rdquo; The text crawls with references to historical events and personages glorified by white supremacists, from the Crusades to the Roman emperor Elagabalus. The killer claimed to have been radicalized by the 2017 death of the young Swedish girl Ebba &Aring;kerlund, whose murder by an Uzbek migrant was covered extensively in the far-right press. And the text is sandwiched between images of the Sonnenrad, or Black Sun, which <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/sonnenrad\">the Anti-Defamation League describes as </a>&ldquo;one of a number of ancient European symbols appropriated by the Nazis in their attempt to invent an idealized &lsquo;Aryan/Norse&rsquo; heritage.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Throughout the text, it&rsquo;s clear that the cultural touchstones Tarrant finds most evocative aren&rsquo;t the fleeting, satire-laced symbols that typify the alt-right, such as Pepe, a cartoon frog adopted by neo-fascists as a satirical mascot. Instead, Tarrant exalts the pure-white past white supremacists have conjured up for Europe, and evokes the maudlin myths of nationalist agitprop. Europe, in his estimation, was once filled with noble white men fighting swarthy interlopers, from Medieval battles against Saracens to the 1683 Turkish siege of Vienna.* The manifesto incorporates poems by Rudyard Kipling and Dylan Thomas. At points, its syntax soars into a kind of faux-Romantic prose: &ldquo;Accept death,&rdquo; he advises his audience, &ldquo;it is as certain as the setting of the sun at evenfall.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tarrant was also deeply immersed in the coarser rhetoric of the anonymous message boards 4chan and 8chan, and other online havens of white-supremacist sentiment. In the 8chan post that contained links to both the manifesto and a Facebook livestream of the killings, he wrote: &ldquo;Well lads, it&rsquo;s time to stop shitposting and make a real-life effort post.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Shitposting,&rdquo; in internet-culture slang, is essentially making a ruckus online for the sake of making a ruckus, flooding message boards or social media with low-quality content.) The image he used to accompany his post was a long-circulating 4chan meme depicting an overly online Australian. And <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/technology/pewdiepie-new-zealand-shooting.html\">his war cry,</a> before opening fire on worshipers, was a reference to a mega-popular YouTuber who goes by PewDiePie.</p>\n<p>In Tarrant&rsquo;s world, two codes&mdash;of racist memes and romantic racist ideology, of viral YouTube videos and high-minded nativist myth&mdash;intermingle until they are indistinguishable. These two syntaxes coexist in Tarrant&rsquo;s manifesto, his actions, and even his gun, on which he painted both a reference to the Battle of Tours in 732, in which a Frankish king conquered Spanish Muslim invaders, and &ldquo;Remove Kebab,&rdquo; a viral anti-Muslim music video of Serbian origin. There is no ready way to unbraid the former from the latter, because the distance from Pepe the Frog to the ancient Celtic Sonnenrad has been closed.</p>\n<p>Tarrant explains their connection himself. &ldquo;Whilst we may use edgy humour and memes in the vanguard stage, and to attract a young audience, eventually we will need to show the reality of our thoughts and our more serious intents and wishes for the future,&rdquo; he writes. This is not the first time the playbook of the online far-right has been laid bare, in particular its use of edgy, provocative humor to draw in young audiences who might be alienated by dense ideological screeds. In 2017, HuffPost journalist Ashley Feinberg <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daily-stormer-nazi-style-guide_us_5a2ece19e4b0ce3b344492f2\">published the style handbook</a> of the Daily Stormer, an infamous and prominent neo-Nazi website. The style guide mandated a &ldquo;humorous, snarky style&rdquo; and noted that &ldquo;genuine raging vitriol&rdquo; was a &ldquo;turnoff.&rdquo; &ldquo;The tone of the site should be light,&rdquo; wrote its founder, Andrew Anglin. &ldquo;This is obviously a ploy and I actually do want to gas kikes. But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Two years later, and the &ldquo;neither here nor there&rdquo; of white supremacy is everywhere, in mosques, in synagogues, in black churches, in cities overrun by fascist marches. To hammer home the point, a handcuffed Tarrant, in the most widespread picture of him to date, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-47596446\">flashed the &ldquo;OK&rdquo; sign toward the cameras</a>&mdash;a hand signal that has been adopted by white supremacists, but remains common enough outside that subculture that those who use it can retain a winking plausible deniability. It&rsquo;s perhaps the purest expression of the white-supremacist in-group mentality: For those who understand it, it is an evident sign of affiliation; to all others who protest it, it is a joke. But the joke, in the end, is that there is no joke. The sensibility of the edgelord&mdash;who pushes the boundaries of offensive humor&mdash;is really one long tumble into the abyss.</p>\n<p>*<i>A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Turkish siege of Vienna occurred in 1863.

                "text": "In the rush of initial reportage that followed the horrific slaughter last week of 51 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand, a document surfaced that purported to be the manifesto of the alleged murderer. Thousands of journalists across the globe tore into its contents, seeking the causes behind the slaughter. The manifesto was littered with memes gleaned from the white-supremacist internet, and some journalists urged colleagues not steeped in the argot of that subculture to tread cautiously. Kevin Roose, a veteran of the deeps of the internet, called the manifesto \u201ca booby trap, a joke designed to ensnare unsuspecting people and members of the media into taking it too literally.\u201d The murders, he said, were \u201cproduced entirely within the irony-soaked discourse of modern extremism.\u201d\nThis analysis was echoed by the venerable internet forensics analysts at Bellingcat: \u201cThis manifesto is a trap itself, laid for journalists searching for meaning behind this horrific crime,\u201d wrote Robert Evans. \u201cThe entire manifesto is dotted, liberally, with references to memes and internet in-jokes that only the extremely online would get.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true that the manifesto contained references to memes that would have been familiar to the murderer\u2019s online compatriots. The alleged killer, 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant, claimed that \u201cSpyro the dragon 3 taught me ethno-nationalism\u201d\u2014an ironic reference to a wholesome game about a purple dragon. In claiming that Candace Owens, a conservative commentator for far-right student group Turning Point USA, helped to teach him \u201cviolence over meekness,\u201d he was probably not being serious; rather, he was seeking to capitalize on tensions between that group and both the far-right and left.\nIt\u2019s tempting to treat Tarrant\u2019s story as a cautionary tale of irony gone too far\u2014until even life and death are a joke, to be viewed at a numb remove. It\u2019s tempting to tell a story of a warped humor that grows edgier and edgier, more and more offensive, until its practitioners fall off the edge, into real racism and real violence. It\u2019s tempting, in other words, to emphasize the online elements of the attack\u2014to posit that a sick internet culture has combined with fascist thought to produce a hybrid more monstrous than anything we\u2019ve seen before.\nBut besides the document\u2019s winks at the slang-riddled discussions of far-right message boards, the manifesto is far from ironic. In fact, for much of its eighty-odd pages, it is a deadly serious screed, promulgating some of white power\u2019s grounding myths and showcasing its most violent consequences. What it reveals is a familiar enemy that, for entirely pragmatic and propagandistic reasons, has dressed itself up in memetic ephemera.\nMuch of the manifesto\u2014which begins with the line, \u201cIt\u2019s the birthrates,\u201d repeated three times\u2014is fixated on reproduction, a classic preoccupation of white supremacist ideology. The author writes about his fear and rage at the thought of \u201cinvaders\u201d\u2014anyone nonwhite, but particularly Muslims\u2014outbreeding \u201cEuropeans.\u201d He claims, baselessly, that Muslims have preternaturally high birth-rates, and that the disparity between white and nonwhite births will lead to the crisis named in the manifesto\u2019s title: the \u201cGreat Replacement,\u201d an ethnic, cultural, and racial erasure. The theory was promulgated by the French racist ideologue Renaud Camus in a 2012 book of the same name; since then, it has spread through an international network of white supremacists.\nFrom its very first page, the manifesto proclaims its ideology in screaming capital letters: \u201cTHIS IS WHITE GENOCIDE.\u201d The text crawls with references to historical events and personages glorified by white supremacists, from the Crusades to the Roman emperor Elagabalus. The killer claimed to have been radicalized by the 2017 death of the young Swedish girl Ebba \u00c5kerlund, whose murder by an Uzbek migrant was covered extensively in the far-right press. And the text is sandwiched between images of the Sonnenrad, or Black Sun, which the Anti-Defamation League describes as \u201cone of a number of ancient European symbols appropriated by the Nazis in their attempt to invent an idealized \u2018Aryan/Norse\u2019 heritage.\u201d\nThroughout the text, it\u2019s clear that the cultural touchstones Tarrant finds most evocative aren\u2019t the fleeting, satire-laced symbols that typify the alt-right, such as Pepe, a cartoon frog adopted by neo-fascists as a satirical mascot. Instead, Tarrant exalts the pure-white past white supremacists have conjured up for Europe, and evokes the maudlin myths of nationalist agitprop. Europe, in his estimation, was once filled with noble white men fighting swarthy interlopers, from Medieval battles against Saracens to the 1683 Turkish siege of Vienna.* The manifesto incorporates poems by Rudyard Kipling and Dylan Thomas. At points, its syntax soars into a kind of faux-Romantic prose: \u201cAccept death,\u201d he advises his audience, \u201cit is as certain as the setting of the sun at evenfall.\u201d\nTarrant was also deeply immersed in the coarser rhetoric of the anonymous message boards 4chan and 8chan, and other online havens of white-supremacist sentiment. In the 8chan post that contained links to both the manifesto and a Facebook livestream of the killings, he wrote: \u201cWell lads, it\u2019s time to stop shitposting and make a real-life effort post.\u201d (\u201cShitposting,\u201d in internet-culture slang, is essentially making a ruckus online for the sake of making a ruckus, flooding message boards or social media with low-quality content.) The image he used to accompany his post was a long-circulating 4chan meme depicting an overly online Australian. And his war cry, before opening fire on worshipers, was a reference to a mega-popular YouTuber who goes by PewDiePie.\nIn Tarrant\u2019s world, two codes\u2014of racist memes and romantic racist ideology, of viral YouTube videos and high-minded nativist myth\u2014intermingle until they are indistinguishable. These two syntaxes coexist in Tarrant\u2019s manifesto, his actions, and even his gun, on which he painted both a reference to the Battle of Tours in 732, in which a Frankish king conquered Spanish Muslim invaders, and \u201cRemove Kebab,\u201d a viral anti-Muslim music video of Serbian origin. There is no ready way to unbraid the former from the latter, because the distance from Pepe the Frog to the ancient Celtic Sonnenrad has been closed.\nTarrant explains their connection himself. \u201cWhilst we may use edgy humour and memes in the vanguard stage, and to attract a young audience, eventually we will need to show the reality of our thoughts and our more serious intents and wishes for the future,\u201d he writes. This is not the first time the playbook of the online far-right has been laid bare, in particular its use of edgy, provocative humor to draw in young audiences who might be alienated by dense ideological screeds. In 2017, HuffPost journalist Ashley Feinberg published the style handbook of the Daily Stormer, an infamous and prominent neo-Nazi website. The style guide mandated a \u201chumorous, snarky style\u201d and noted that \u201cgenuine raging vitriol\u201d was a \u201cturnoff.\u201d \u201cThe tone of the site should be light,\u201d wrote its founder, Andrew Anglin. \u201cThis is obviously a ploy and I actually do want to gas kikes. But that\u2019s neither here nor there.\u201d\nTwo years later, and the \u201cneither here nor there\u201d of white supremacy is everywhere, in mosques, in synagogues, in black churches, in cities overrun by fascist marches. To hammer home the point, a handcuffed Tarrant, in the most widespread picture of him to date, flashed the \u201cOK\u201d sign toward the cameras\u2014a hand signal that has been adopted by white supremacists, but remains common enough outside that subculture that those who use it can retain a winking plausible deniability. It\u2019s perhaps the purest expression of the white-supremacist in-group mentality: For those who understand it, it is an evident sign of affiliation; to all others who protest it, it is a joke. But the joke, in the end, is that there is no joke. The sensibility of the edgelord\u2014who pushes the boundaries of offensive humor\u2014is really one long tumble into the abyss.\n*A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Turkish siege of Vienna occurred in 1863.

But Devin Nunes has done the impossible and surpassed even Donald Trump in hypersensitivity.</p>\n<p>Nunes, a Republican representative from California, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/us/politics/devin-nunes-twitter-lawsuit.html\">filed a $250 million lawsuit</a> on Monday against Twitter and a handful of users who criticized him, accusing them of negligence and defamation. He even claims that the defendants are part of a grand conspiracy to cripple his political career. Who&rsquo;s leading this dastardly plot? Nunes doesn&rsquo;t quite say. Maybe it&rsquo;s the Democratic Party, he suggests. Or unnamed liberal donors. Or even hostile foreign adversaries. Whoever these hostile actors are, they&rsquo;re not only causing him grievous harm; they&rsquo;re contributing to &ldquo;the corruption of American democracy and society.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What the lawsuit really demonstrates, though, is the stunning vindictiveness of a powerful elected official who would use the legal system to punish his critics. If the lawsuit was intended to vindicate Nunes and his reputation, it has achieved precisely the opposite.</p>\n<p>Nunes rose to national fame over the last two years as the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, a perch he used to undermine the Russia investigation and defend Trump. In the <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/402297422/Nunes-Complaint-3-18-19\">complaint</a>, he depicts himself as an honorable public servant who&rsquo;s been wrongly maligned by his powerful opponents&mdash;only one of whom, longtime Republican political operative Liz Mair, is explicitly named. The others are unknown to him: the Twitter users responsible foranonymous parody accounts such as &ldquo;Devin Nunes&rsquo; Mom,&rdquo; &ldquo;Devin Nunes&rsquo; Cow,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fire Devin Nunes,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Devin Nunes&rsquo; Grapes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Nunes obliquely implies that Mair is in cahoots with these accounts&rsquo; owners, but offers no proof to support the theory. Either way, like a high school teacher hit from behind with a spitball, he&rsquo;s determined to find out who&rsquo;s responsible. &ldquo;The identity of those behind the Twitter accounts is a matter of great public concern,&rdquo; Nunes told the court. &ldquo;Whether the accounts are controlled by wealthy Democrats, the Democratic National Committee, an opposition research firm, such as Fusion GPS, the &lsquo;Russians,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Chinese,&rsquo; or some other foreign government or non-governmental organization, the corruption of American democracy and society by intentional falsehoods, fraud and defamation must stop.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What horrible things did these accounts say about Nunes to warrant the judiciary&rsquo;s intervention? The account named &ldquo;Devin Nunes&rsquo; Mom&rdquo; receives the most attention in the complaint. Its owner frequently posted caustic remarks about him and his actions toward the Russia investigation. One tweet said that Nunes was unfit to run the House Intelligence Committee, while another joked that he was &ldquo;voted &lsquo;Most Likely to Commit Treason&rsquo; in high school.&rdquo; Some tweets are indistinguishable from legitimate political criticism. Others are more puerile, implying that Nunes wanted to commit sexual acts with Trump and other top Republicans.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In her endless barrage of tweets, Devin Nunes&rsquo; Mom maliciously attacked every aspect of Nunes&rsquo; character, honesty, integrity, ethics and fitness to perform his duties as a United States Congressman,&rdquo; Nunes wrote in the complaint. Twitter apparently suspended the account this month for impersonating a real person, but not before he &ldquo;suffered substantial insult, humiliation, embarrassment, pain, mental suffering and damage to his reputation as a result of the unprecedented personal and professional attacks on his character.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Why did these tweets wound Nunes so deeply? The accounts&rsquo; jibes resemble much of the political commentary on Twitter&mdash;including the president&rsquo;s. Nunes&rsquo;s real grievance appears to be with Twitter itself. &ldquo;Twitter represents that it enforces its Terms and Rules equally and that it does not discriminate against conservatives who wish to use its &lsquo;public square,&rsquo;&rdquo; he told the court. &ldquo;This is not true. This is a lie. Twitter actively censors and shadow-bans conservatives, such as Plaintiff, thereby eliminating his voice while amplifying the voices of his Democratic detractors.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Twitter has <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/Setting-the-record-straight-on-shadow-banning.html\">denied</a> that it uses shadow banning&mdash;making a user&rsquo;s posts visible to themselves but invisible to others&mdash;but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped Republican lawmakers, including Trump, from making the claim as part of a broader narrative that Silicon Valley is censoring conservative voices.</p>\n<p>Nunes&rsquo;s claim for damages also doesn&rsquo;t hold up. He says that Twitter bears legal responsibility for any defamatory posts made on its platform. In reality, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act generally shields websites from civil liability related to third-party content on their platforms. Nunes himself should be pretty familiar with this: As <i>Reason</i>&rsquo;s Elizabeth Nolan Brown pointed out, he and his colleagues have been <a href=\"http://reason.com/blog/2019/03/19/nunes-has-a-cow-over-twitter\">working to change</a> Section 230 for this exact reason.</p>\n<p>Nunes adopts a patriotic mien when it comes to the broader free speech issues at stake. &ldquo;Access to Twitter is essential for meaningful participation in modern-day American Democracy,&rdquo; he told the court. &ldquo;A candidate without Twitter is a losing candidate. The ability to use Twitter is a vital part of modern citizenship. A presence on Twitter is essential for an individual to run for office or engage in any level of political organizing in modern America. This is because Twitter is not merely a website: it is the modern town square.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This paean to civic speech might be more convincing if Nunes didn&rsquo;t ask the court to force Twitter to &ldquo;reveal the names and contact information&rdquo; behind four of the pseudonymous accounts. What&rsquo;s more, he also wants the court to &ldquo;permanently enjoin and order Twitter&rdquo; to suspend Mair and the other accounts. Twitter is a vital part of modern American citizenship, Nunes says, and he wants the government to strip people of access to it for being mean to him.</p>\n<p>But Americans have every right to mock and insult their elected officials. During the election of 1796, the first contested presidential race in the nation&rsquo;s history, Alexander Hamilton <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/on-this-day-the-first-bitter-contested-presidential-election-takes-place\">wrote a pseudonymous pamphlet</a> that accused Thomas Jefferson of having an affair with an enslaved woman he owned. (The allegation later turned out to be true.) Jefferson&rsquo;s supporters jeered at John Adams as &ldquo;His Rotundity&rdquo; and called him a hermaphrodite, while Adams&rsquo;s camp accused Jefferson of supporting prostitution and incest. Adams later arrested one of Jefferson&rsquo;s pamphleteers during the election of 1800 and tried to prosecute him under the Alien and Sedition Acts. The American tradition of salacious and spurious political attacks is alive and well in the Trump era.</p>\n<p><i>The New York Times Co.</i> v. <i>Sullivan</i>, a Supreme Court case from 1964, set a formidable threshold for defamation claims by public figures like Nunes. The justices cited a &ldquo;profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,&rdquo; even if it includes &ldquo;vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.&rdquo; The tweets against Nunes appear to fall well within those bounds. But Nunes ignores that landmark ruling (perhaps because, like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/clarence-thomas-first-amendment-libel.html\">Justice Clarence Thomas</a>, he would like to see <i>Sullivan</i> overturned). Instead, he cites a smattering of other cases to defend his &ldquo;fundamental constitutional interest and entitlement to the uninterrupted enjoyment of his reputation.&rdquo; One of his longest citations isn&rsquo;t from law, but a passage from Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Othello</i> in which Iago bemoans that &ldquo;he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him, And makes me poor indeed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So why embark on what appears to be a doomed legal endeavor? Perhaps Nunes genuinely believes he&rsquo;s the victim of a conspiracy theory by Democrats and America&rsquo;s foreign adversaries. If there&rsquo;s evidence to support this, Nunes doesn&rsquo;t offer it. &ldquo;The full scope of the conspiracy, including the names of all participants and the level of involvement of donors and members of the Democratic Party, is unknown at this time and will be the subject of discovery in this action,&rdquo; he noted in the complaint. In other words, Nunes wants to go on a fishing expedition to satiate his political grievances, and he wants the courts to light the way.</p>\n<p>Or maybe Nunes is trying to use the legal system to get revenge on his political opponents. Defending oneself against litigation is onerous even for those with the financial means to fight back. (Mair <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LizMair/status/1107822593711767552\">urged her Twitter followers</a> on Monday night to donate to her legal defense fund.) The rich have always wielded the American legal system as a cudgel against critics, as Peter Thiel <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/peter-thiel-tech-billionaire-reveals-secret-war-with-gawker.html\">did</a> in financing the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that ultimately killed Gawker. That a member of Congress would attempt to do so is deeply disturbing.</p>",

If the lawsuit was intended to vindicate Nunes and his reputation, it has achieved precisely the opposite.\nNunes rose to national fame over the last two years as the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, a perch he used to undermine the Russia investigation and defend Trump. In the complaint, he depicts himself as an honorable public servant who\u2019s been wrongly maligned by his powerful opponents\u2014only one of whom, longtime Republican political operative Liz Mair, is explicitly named. The others are unknown to him: the Twitter users responsible foranonymous parody accounts such as \u201cDevin Nunes\u2019 Mom,\u201d \u201cDevin Nunes\u2019 Cow,\u201d \u201cFire Devin Nunes,\u201d and \u201cDevin Nunes\u2019 Grapes.\u201d\nNunes obliquely implies that Mair is in cahoots with these accounts\u2019 owners, but offers no proof to support the theory. Either way, like a high school teacher hit from behind with a spitball, he\u2019s determined to find out who\u2019s responsible. \u201cThe identity of those behind the Twitter accounts is a matter of great public concern,\u201d Nunes told the court. \u201cWhether the accounts are controlled by wealthy Democrats, the Democratic National Committee, an opposition research firm, such as Fusion GPS, the \u2018Russians,\u2019 the \u2018Chinese,\u2019 or some other foreign government or non-governmental organization, the corruption of American democracy and society by intentional falsehoods, fraud and defamation must stop.\u201d\nWhat horrible things did these accounts say about Nunes to warrant the judiciary\u2019s intervention? The account named \u201cDevin Nunes\u2019 Mom\u201d receives the most attention in the complaint. Its owner frequently posted caustic remarks about him and his actions toward the Russia investigation. One tweet said that Nunes was unfit to run the House Intelligence Committee, while another joked that he was \u201cvoted \u2018Most Likely to Commit Treason\u2019 in high school.\u201d Some tweets are indistinguishable from legitimate political criticism. Others are more puerile, implying that Nunes wanted to commit sexual acts with Trump and other top Republicans.\n\u201cIn her endless barrage of tweets, Devin Nunes\u2019 Mom maliciously attacked every aspect of Nunes\u2019 character, honesty, integrity, ethics and fitness to perform his duties as a United States Congressman,\u201d Nunes wrote in the complaint. Twitter apparently suspended the account this month for impersonating a real person, but not before he \u201csuffered substantial insult, humiliation, embarrassment, pain, mental suffering and damage to his reputation as a result of the unprecedented personal and professional attacks on his character.\u201d\nWhy did these tweets wound Nunes so deeply? The accounts\u2019 jibes resemble much of the political commentary on Twitter\u2014including the president\u2019s. Nunes\u2019s real grievance appears to be with Twitter itself. \u201cTwitter represents that it enforces its Terms and Rules equally and that it does not discriminate against conservatives who wish to use its \u2018public square,\u2019\u201d he told the court. \u201cThis is not true. This is a lie. Twitter actively censors and shadow-bans conservatives, such as Plaintiff, thereby eliminating his voice while amplifying the voices of his Democratic detractors.\u201d\nTwitter has denied that it uses shadow banning\u2014making a user\u2019s posts visible to themselves but invisible to others\u2014but that hasn\u2019t stopped Republican lawmakers, including Trump, from making the claim as part of a broader narrative that Silicon Valley is censoring conservative voices.\nNunes\u2019s claim for damages also doesn\u2019t hold up. He says that Twitter bears legal responsibility for any defamatory posts made on its platform. In reality, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act generally shields websites from civil liability related to third-party content on their platforms. Nunes himself should be pretty familiar with this: As Reason\u2019s Elizabeth Nolan Brown pointed out, he and his colleagues have been working to change Section 230 for this exact reason.\nNunes adopts a patriotic mien when it comes to the broader free speech issues at stake. \u201cAccess to Twitter is essential for meaningful participation in modern-day American Democracy,\u201d he told the court. \u201cA candidate without Twitter is a losing candidate. The ability to use Twitter is a vital part of modern citizenship. A presence on Twitter is essential for an individual to run for office or engage in any level of political organizing in modern America. This is because Twitter is not merely a website: it is the modern town square.\u201d\nThis paean to civic speech might be more convincing if Nunes didn\u2019t ask the court to force Twitter to \u201creveal the names and contact information\u201d behind four of the pseudonymous accounts. What\u2019s more, he also wants the court to \u201cpermanently enjoin and order Twitter\u201d to suspend Mair and the other accounts. Twitter is a vital part of modern American citizenship, Nunes says, and he wants the government to strip people of access to it for being mean to him.\nBut Americans have every right to mock and insult their elected officials. During the election of 1796, the first contested presidential race in the nation\u2019s history, Alexander Hamilton wrote a pseudonymous pamphlet that accused Thomas Jefferson of having an affair with an enslaved woman he owned. (The allegation later turned out to be true.) Jefferson\u2019s supporters jeered at John Adams as \u201cHis Rotundity\u201d and called him a hermaphrodite, while Adams\u2019s camp accused Jefferson of supporting prostitution and incest. Adams later arrested one of Jefferson\u2019s pamphleteers during the election of 1800 and tried to prosecute him under the Alien and Sedition Acts. The American tradition of salacious and spurious political attacks is alive and well in the Trump era.\nThe New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, a Supreme Court case from 1964, set a formidable threshold for defamation claims by public figures like Nunes. The justices cited a \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\u201d even if it includes \u201cvehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d The tweets against Nunes appear to fall well within those bounds. But Nunes ignores that landmark ruling (perhaps because, like Justice Clarence Thomas, he would like to see Sullivan overturned). Instead, he cites a smattering of other cases to defend his \u201cfundamental constitutional interest and entitlement to the uninterrupted enjoyment of his reputation.\u201d One of his longest citations isn\u2019t from law, but a passage from Shakespeare\u2019s Othello in which Iago bemoans that \u201che that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him, And makes me poor indeed.\u201d\nSo why embark on what appears to be a doomed legal endeavor? Perhaps Nunes genuinely believes he\u2019s the victim of a conspiracy theory by Democrats and America\u2019s foreign adversaries. If there\u2019s evidence to support this, Nunes doesn\u2019t offer it. \u201cThe full scope of the conspiracy, including the names of all participants and the level of involvement of donors and members of the Democratic Party, is unknown at this time and will be the subject of discovery in this action,\u201d he noted in the complaint. In other words, Nunes wants to go on a fishing expedition to satiate his political grievances, and he wants the courts to light the way.\nOr maybe Nunes is trying to use the legal system to get revenge on his political opponents. Defending oneself against litigation is onerous even for those with the financial means to fight back. (Mair urged her Twitter followers on Monday night to donate to her legal defense fund.) The rich have always wielded the American legal system as a cudgel against critics, as Peter Thiel did in financing the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that ultimately killed Gawker. That a member of Congress would attempt to do so is deeply disturbing.",

That&rsquo;s why he filed the lawsuit against their employer. &ldquo;In our view, it&rsquo;s a small case,&rdquo; the California-based labor attorney told me. He never imagined it would attract the attention of powerful oil industry groups and the federal government&mdash;or that it would go all the way to the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>But it has. And on Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in <i>Parker Drilling Management Services vs. Newton</i>, an appeal of Strauss&rsquo;s class action lawsuit against Parker Drilling, a now-bankrupt offshore oil platform operator. The case seeks back pay for more than 25 employees who lived and worked on island-like structures off the California coast. For 14-day stints, the employees would spend 12 hours per day actively working, and the other 12 hours on &ldquo;controlled standby&rdquo;&mdash;meaning they could do whatever they wanted on the platform, but could be called back to work at any time. California wage law requires employees to be paid for such &ldquo;on call&rdquo; time, but Parker Drilling employees were paid only for their 12-hour active shifts and not for the standby. Ergo the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>The case, so far, has gone mostly unnoticed, and in a way, it echoes the entire conversation about offshore drilling in the U.S. As the Trump administration seeks to expand and deregulate the controversial practice, the rest of the country has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/14/offshore-drilling-trump-official-reveals-plan-and-distractions-delight\">largely distracted</a>.</p>\n<p>The oil industry, however, is not distracted. They&rsquo;ve been watching <i>Parker Drilling vs. Newton </i>closely. Now, <a href=\"https://www.chamberlitigation.com/sites/default/files/cases/files/18181818/U.S.%20Chamber%2C%20et%20al.%20Amicus%20Brief%20--%20Newton%20v.%20Parker%20Drilling%20Management%20Services%2C%20Inc.%20%28Ninth%20Circuit%29.pdf\">a coalition of powerful trade associations and companies</a>&mdash;including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and ExxonMobil&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-389/90005/20190227191225843_18-389tsacUnitedStates.pdf\">and the federal government</a> are urging the Supreme Court to reverse the lower court&rsquo;s ruling in favor of the workers, and hold that only federal wage law can apply to oil platforms located on the Outer Continental Shelf, the area of ocean that surrounds the United States, but that is not technically part of any state. The petitioners say the entire oil industry has much to lose&mdash;&ldquo;hundreds of millions,&rdquo; according to them&mdash;if the Supreme Court doesn&rsquo;t do this. But it also has much to gain if it does.</p>\n<p>To understand <i>Parker Drilling vs. Newton</i>, one must also understand what it&rsquo;s like to work on an offshore oil rig. And Shane Newton&mdash;unrelated to the case&rsquo;s lead plaintiff, Brian Newton&mdash;worked on more than 300 of them over the course of 26 years, from 1991 to 2015.</p>\n<p>The first thing, Newton said, is that almost every offshore platform operator requires employees to live there while they work. The stints&mdash;or &ldquo;hitches,&rdquo; as they&rsquo;re known in the industry&mdash;vary in length. &ldquo;In the Gulf of Mexico, I&rsquo;d be out there for 6 to 8 weeks at a time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But with ExxonMobil, there&rsquo;s a rule where you have to leave the premises after 14 days.&rdquo; With Parker Drilling, the mandated stints were 14 days on the platform, followed by 14 days on land.</p>\n<p>A platform itself varies in size. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been on some that&rsquo;ll handle 30 people, about the size of a good-sized store. Two layers, 50-by-50 feet,&rdquo; Newton said. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ve been on some that are the size of a Walmart.&rdquo; The fixed layout means personal space is generally lacking, and workers almost always share a room unless they&rsquo;re supervisors. &ldquo;Most of the time, you&rsquo;re looking at anywhere from four to twelve [roommates],&rdquo; Newton said. &ldquo;The privacy is the biggest issue.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;Instead of seeing his child born, all he could do was hear his child born over the phone.&rdquo;</aside>\n<p>Make no mistake, though&mdash;Newton liked working out there. &ldquo;What kept me doing it was the constant moving,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I like getting things done, I like new things, and it didn&rsquo;t matter being away from home.&rdquo; Others, however, weren&rsquo;t as mentally well-equipped for the conditions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent more people on boats going home because they couldn&rsquo;t handle it than I can count,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>The biggest mental toll is isolation. Newton recalled one co-worker whose pregnant wife went into labor earlier than expected, and who wasn&rsquo;t able to access a boat in time to get home for the birth. &ldquo;Instead of seeing his child born, all he could do was hear his child born over the phone,&rdquo; Newton said. &ldquo;He never came back to work after that.&rdquo; Newton himself was unable to rush home when he got a call that his house was on fire in 2010. &ldquo;It took about 8 to 10 hours before someone could come get me,&rdquo; he said. His house burned down.</p>\n<p>Unlike his co-worker, though, Newton kept going back to work offshore. As a result, his personal relationships suffered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my third marriage,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My son&rsquo;s 18, and I might have seen him five of those 18 years.&rdquo; The realization that he had missed much of his son&rsquo;s life was why Newton ultimately decided to leave the profession in 2015. &ldquo;Up until then I hadn&rsquo;t realized I was doing anything wrong,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Offshore platform work does pay well compared to the average hourly job. Such is a big reason why oil companies and their trade associations say the California plaintiffs in <i>Parker Drilling vs. Newton </i>shouldn&rsquo;t be paid for their 12-hour on-call shifts. An electrician averages about $30-$35 an hour off the coast of California, Newton said, and about $18 to $26 an hour in the Gulf of Mexico. Workers also tend to save money faster than the average person because they&rsquo;re not spending while they&rsquo;re on the platform. They&rsquo;re not driving to work, going to happy hours, or paying for their own food. And when they&rsquo;re not actively working, they always have plenty to do, according to the drilling companies. &ldquo;The platforms are equipped with various amenities for employees to use free of charge, including cable, internet access, and fitness and recreation facilities, allowing employees to engage cost-free in many of the same personal-time activities they enjoy on land,&rdquo; the groups wrote in one legal brief.</p>\n<p>The industry&rsquo;s rosy picture of life offshore isn&rsquo;t entirely accurate, however. Yes, some platforms have gyms, according to Newton, but not all of them. The Internet is also a fairly new addition to platform life, and rarely works correctly. And contrary to the picture industry paints, time spent on-call isn&rsquo;t play time. When they&rsquo;re not actively on the job, platform workers live with the knowledge that they could have to throw their hard hat back on at any moment&mdash;even while they&rsquo;re sleeping. And they are dealing with a social dynamic that is far from equivalent to the average workers&rsquo; free time spent at home.</p>\n<p>But even if it were a paradise on oil platforms, Newton said he still thinks workers off the coast of California should be paid for their on-call time because everyone else who works in the state is paid for it. &ldquo;I give you a fair days&rsquo; work, and I&rsquo;m waiting there on call, and I should be compensated for it,&rdquo; he said. Newton does not sympathize with oil companies&rsquo; sob stories about their bottom lines. &ldquo;They make <i>a lot</i> of money,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They should have a little bit to go out to the employees.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;Why, when you cross an arbitrary line in the water, do you cease to be paid for something you would be paid for in California?&rdquo;</aside>\n<p>The key point for Andrew Ellison, who&rsquo;s also representing the workers in <i>Parker Drilling vs. Newton</i>, is fairness<i>. </i>&ldquo;If they were on land in California, they&rsquo;d be paid for this work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why, when you cross an arbitrary line in the water, do you cease to be paid for something you would be paid for in California?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But for the oil industry, the key point is that arbitrary line. Because legally, anything beyond three miles off the California coastline is not California. It&rsquo;s the Outer Continental Shelf. That&rsquo;s governed by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act&mdash;or OCSLA. And OCSLA says out there, federal law applies.</p>\n<p>OCSLA also says, however, that the adjacent state&rsquo;s laws can apply out there as well&mdash;but only if they&rsquo;re &ldquo;applicable and not inconsistent with&rdquo; federal law. The workers say California&rsquo;s wage law meets that standard; the oil industry says it doesn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s the legal question at the heart of the dispute before the Court, but the decision could also affect the future of the offshore oil industry.</p>\n<p>If the Supreme Court were to rule in the workers&rsquo; favor, Parker Drilling (now in chapter 11 restructuring) would eventually be forced to pay its former employees for the time they worked on-call. But that wouldn&rsquo;t be all it would do.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/18-389.html\">brief filed to the high court</a> last year, the oil industry coalition warned of broad financial consequences to its operations if the justices found that California wage law can apply to platforms off its coastline. Any California-based offshore oil company that didn&rsquo;t previously pay its workers for on-call shifts would be open to lawsuits from workers seeking backpay. That could &ldquo;inflict hundreds of millions of dollars of liability&rdquo; on companies. &ldquo;Such a result would give employees&mdash;already generously compensated under existing arrangements&mdash;a windfall of backpay, plus interest and penalties,&rdquo; they wrote.</p>\n<p>But the industry coalition also issued another warning: to its own workers. If the Supreme Court didn&rsquo;t rule in its favor, they wrote, &ldquo;It is doubtful that employers could offer such generous compensation and benefit terms, if relationships are subject to state-law overtime and other requirements enacted without regard for the unique circumstances of [offshore] work.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A ruling in Parker Drilling&rsquo;s favor, on the other hand, could seal the offshore industry off from state wage claims. And depending on how broadly the Supreme Court rules, it could protect much of the industry from other state regulation, as well, whether labor, environmental, or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Such potential is likely why the federal government intervened in the case, too. The Trump administration has been hell-bent on expanding and deregulating the offshore oil industry from its earliest days, but has faced strong <a href=\"https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/coastal-states-link-arms-to-oppose-trump-offshore-drilling-plan\">opposition and roadblocks from coastal states</a>. To solve that problem, the administration has been exploring various ways to take states out of the picture. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-offshore-drilling-states-coastal-act-20190321-story.html\">reported</a> last month, for example, that Trump&rsquo;s been &ldquo;quietly laying the groundwork to weaken a decades-old federal law that empowers California and other states to slow and even stop offshore development in federal waters.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In its <i>Parker Drilling</i> brief, the federal government urged the Supreme Court to rule against the workers, and protect &ldquo;the federal government&rsquo;s paramount interests on the Outer Continental Shelf.&rdquo; Doing so would certainly reduce the oil industry&rsquo;s liability, and thus their costs. But if the case itself shows one thing, it&rsquo;s that those costs won&rsquo;t ever really go away. They&rsquo;ll just be absorbed by workers who, until now, have been largely invisible.</p>",

                "text": "Michael Strauss just wanted the oil workers to get paid appropriately for their dangerous, demanding jobs. That\u2019s why he filed the lawsuit against their employer. \u201cIn our view, it\u2019s a small case,\u201d the California-based labor attorney told me. He never imagined it would attract the attention of powerful oil industry groups and the federal government\u2014or that it would go all the way to the United States Supreme Court.\nBut it has. And on Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Parker Drilling Management Services vs. Newton, an appeal of Strauss\u2019s class action lawsuit against Parker Drilling, a now-bankrupt offshore oil platform operator. The case seeks back pay for more than 25 employees who lived and worked on island-like structures off the California coast. For 14-day stints, the employees would spend 12 hours per day actively working, and the other 12 hours on \u201ccontrolled standby\u201d\u2014meaning they could do whatever they wanted on the platform, but could be called back to work at any time. California wage law requires employees to be paid for such \u201con call\u201d time, but Parker Drilling employees were paid only for their 12-hour active shifts and not for the standby. Ergo the lawsuit.\nThe case, so far, has gone mostly unnoticed, and in a way, it echoes the entire conversation about offshore drilling in the U.S. As the Trump administration seeks to expand and deregulate the controversial practice, the rest of the country has been largely distracted.\nThe oil industry, however, is not distracted. They\u2019ve been watching Parker Drilling vs. Newton closely. Now, a coalition of powerful trade associations and companies\u2014including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and ExxonMobil\u2014and the federal government are urging the Supreme Court to reverse the lower court\u2019s ruling in favor of the workers, and hold that only federal wage law can apply to oil platforms located on the Outer Continental Shelf, the area of ocean that surrounds the United States, but that is not technically part of any state. The petitioners say the entire oil industry has much to lose\u2014\u201chundreds of millions,\u201d according to them\u2014if the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t do this. But it also has much to gain if it does.\nTo understand Parker Drilling vs. Newton, one must also understand what it\u2019s like to work on an offshore oil rig. And Shane Newton\u2014unrelated to the case\u2019s lead plaintiff, Brian Newton\u2014worked on more than 300 of them over the course of 26 years, from 1991 to 2015.\nThe first thing, Newton said, is that almost every offshore platform operator requires employees to live there while they work. The stints\u2014or \u201chitches,\u201d as they\u2019re known in the industry\u2014vary in length. \u201cIn the Gulf of Mexico, I\u2019d be out there for 6 to 8 weeks at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with ExxonMobil, there\u2019s a rule where you have to leave the premises after 14 days.\u201d With Parker Drilling, the mandated stints were 14 days on the platform, followed by 14 days on land.\nA platform itself varies in size. \u201cI\u2019ve been on some that\u2019ll handle 30 people, about the size of a good-sized store. Two layers, 50-by-50 feet,\u201d Newton said. \u201cThen I\u2019ve been on some that are the size of a Walmart.\u201d The fixed layout means personal space is generally lacking, and workers almost always share a room unless they\u2019re supervisors. \u201cMost of the time, you\u2019re looking at anywhere from four to twelve [roommates],\u201d Newton said. \u201cThe privacy is the biggest issue.\u201d\n\u201cInstead of seeing his child born, all he could do was hear his child born over the phone.\u201d\nMake no mistake, though\u2014Newton liked working out there. \u201cWhat kept me doing it was the constant moving,\u201d he said. \u201cI like getting things done, I like new things, and it didn\u2019t matter being away from home.\u201d Others, however, weren\u2019t as mentally well-equipped for the conditions. \u201cI\u2019ve sent more people on boats going home because they couldn\u2019t handle it than I can count,\u201d he said.\nThe biggest mental toll is isolation. Newton recalled one co-worker whose pregnant wife went into labor earlier than expected, and who wasn\u2019t able to access a boat in time to get home for the birth. \u201cInstead of seeing his child born, all he could do was hear his child born over the phone,\u201d Newton said. \u201cHe never came back to work after that.\u201d Newton himself was unable to rush home when he got a call that his house was on fire in 2010. \u201cIt took about 8 to 10 hours before someone could come get me,\u201d he said. His house burned down.\nUnlike his co-worker, though, Newton kept going back to work offshore. As a result, his personal relationships suffered. \u201cI\u2019m on my third marriage,\u201d he said. \u201cMy son\u2019s 18, and I might have seen him five of those 18 years.\u201d The realization that he had missed much of his son\u2019s life was why Newton ultimately decided to leave the profession in 2015. \u201cUp until then I hadn\u2019t realized I was doing anything wrong,\u201d he said.\nOffshore platform work does pay well compared to the average hourly job. Such is a big reason why oil companies and their trade associations say the California plaintiffs in Parker Drilling vs. Newton shouldn\u2019t be paid for their 12-hour on-call shifts. An electrician averages about $30-$35 an hour off the coast of California, Newton said, and about $18 to $26 an hour in the Gulf of Mexico. Workers also tend to save money faster than the average person because they\u2019re not spending while they\u2019re on the platform. They\u2019re not driving to work, going to happy hours, or paying for their own food. And when they\u2019re not actively working, they always have plenty to do, according to the drilling companies. \u201cThe platforms are equipped with various amenities for employees to use free of charge, including cable, internet access, and fitness and recreation facilities, allowing employees to engage cost-free in many of the same personal-time activities they enjoy on land,\u201d the groups wrote in one legal brief.\nThe industry\u2019s rosy picture of life offshore isn\u2019t entirely accurate, however. Yes, some platforms have gyms, according to Newton, but not all of them. The Internet is also a fairly new addition to platform life, and rarely works correctly. And contrary to the picture industry paints, time spent on-call isn\u2019t play time. When they\u2019re not actively on the job, platform workers live with the knowledge that they could have to throw their hard hat back on at any moment\u2014even while they\u2019re sleeping. And they are dealing with a social dynamic that is far from equivalent to the average workers\u2019 free time spent at home.\nBut even if it were a paradise on oil platforms, Newton said he still thinks workers off the coast of California should be paid for their on-call time because everyone else who works in the state is paid for it. \u201cI give you a fair days\u2019 work, and I\u2019m waiting there on call, and I should be compensated for it,\u201d he said. Newton does not sympathize with oil companies\u2019 sob stories about their bottom lines. \u201cThey make a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should have a little bit to go out to the employees.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, when you cross an arbitrary line in the water, do you cease to be paid for something you would be paid for in California?\u201d\nThe key point for Andrew Ellison, who\u2019s also representing the workers in Parker Drilling vs. Newton, is fairness. \u201cIf they were on land in California, they\u2019d be paid for this work,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy, when you cross an arbitrary line in the water, do you cease to be paid for something you would be paid for in California?\u201d\nBut for the oil industry, the key point is that arbitrary line. Because legally, anything beyond three miles off the California coastline is not California. It\u2019s the Outer Continental Shelf. That\u2019s governed by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act\u2014or OCSLA. And OCSLA says out there, federal law applies.\nOCSLA also says, however, that the adjacent state\u2019s laws can apply out there as well\u2014but only if they\u2019re \u201capplicable and not inconsistent with\u201d federal law. The workers say California\u2019s wage law meets that standard; the oil industry says it doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s the legal question at the heart of the dispute before the Court, but the decision could also affect the future of the offshore oil industry.\nIf the Supreme Court were to rule in the workers\u2019 favor, Parker Drilling (now in chapter 11 restructuring) would eventually be forced to pay its former employees for the time they worked on-call. But that wouldn\u2019t be all it would do.\nIn a brief filed to the high court last year, the oil industry coalition warned of broad financial consequences to its operations if the justices found that California wage law can apply to platforms off its coastline. Any California-based offshore oil company that didn\u2019t previously pay its workers for on-call shifts would be open to lawsuits from workers seeking backpay. That could \u201cinflict hundreds of millions of dollars of liability\u201d on companies. \u201cSuch a result would give employees\u2014already generously compensated under existing arrangements\u2014a windfall of backpay, plus interest and penalties,\u201d they wrote.\nBut the industry coalition also issued another warning: to its own workers. If the Supreme Court didn\u2019t rule in its favor, they wrote, \u201cIt is doubtful that employers could offer such generous compensation and benefit terms, if relationships are subject to state-law overtime and other requirements enacted without regard for the unique circumstances of [offshore] work.\u201d\nA ruling in Parker Drilling\u2019s favor, on the other hand, could seal the offshore industry off from state wage claims. And depending on how broadly the Supreme Court rules, it could protect much of the industry from other state regulation, as well, whether labor, environmental, or otherwise.\nSuch potential is likely why the federal government intervened in the case, too. The Trump administration has been hell-bent on expanding and deregulating the offshore oil industry from its earliest days, but has faced strong opposition and roadblocks from coastal states. To solve that problem, the administration has been exploring various ways to take states out of the picture. The Los Angeles Times reported last month, for example, that Trump\u2019s been \u201cquietly laying the groundwork to weaken a decades-old federal law that empowers California and other states to slow and even stop offshore development in federal waters.\u201d\nIn its Parker Drilling brief, the federal government urged the Supreme Court to rule against the workers, and protect \u201cthe federal government\u2019s paramount interests on the Outer Continental Shelf.\u201d Doing so would certainly reduce the oil industry\u2019s liability, and thus their costs. But if the case itself shows one thing, it\u2019s that those costs won\u2019t ever really go away. They\u2019ll just be absorbed by workers who, until now, have been largely invisible.",

Progressive activists and commentators hailed de Blasio&rsquo;s landslide victory in New York&rsquo;s 2013 mayoral election as a sign of an encouraging new direction for the Democratic Party. His unabashedly liberal campaign&mdash;which centered on income inequality, or what de Blasio poetically termed a &ldquo;tale of two cities&rdquo;&mdash;prefigured the unrest that would shake the party, culminating in Bernie Sanders&rsquo;s unlikely challenge to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primary.</p>\n<p>De Blasio&rsquo;s 2013 platform, which <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/nyregion/de-blasio-offers-ideas-in-policy-book-for-election.html\"><i>The New York Times</i></a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/nyregion/de-blasio-offers-ideas-in-policy-book-for-election.html\"> called</a> &ldquo;the meatiest material presented by any candidate&rdquo; in the field, sounded themes that are now standard fare for Democrats with national ambitions. He promised a universal pre-kindergarten program, paid for by a tax on the wealthy; an identification card that would allow undocumented immigrants to access city services; an ambitious plan to build or preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing; and reform of stop-and-frisk, the Bloomberg-era program that effectively allowed police to target minorities with warrantless searches. &ldquo;Government must focus on the needs of families, must be the protector of neighborhoods, and must guard the people from the enormous power of moneyed interests,&rdquo; de Blasio thundered in his <a href=\"https://observer.com/2013/01/bill-de-blasio-tells-a-tale-of-two-cities-at-his-mayoral-campaign-kickoff/\">campaign announcement</a>.</p>\n<p>Democratic voters rebuked twelve years of plutocratic rule by handing de Blasio a primary victory over the Bloomberg-favored Christine Quinn.* As Peter Beinart <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-rise-of-the-new-new-left?ref=scroll\">wrote in The Daily Beast</a>, &ldquo;De Blasio&rsquo;s victory is an omen of what may become the defining story of America&rsquo;s next political era: the challenge, to both parties, from the left.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a challenge Hillary Clinton should start worrying about now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Yet as de Blasio <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-2020.html\">weighs entering the 2020 race</a>, the prospect of a President de Blasio has been met with widespread derision. <i>The New Republic</i>&rsquo;s Alex Shephard <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/153368/bill-de-blasios-embarrassing-quest-national-fame\">termed</a> his interest in the presidency an &ldquo;embarrassing quest for national fame,&rdquo; while the mayor&rsquo;s own allies (anonymously) <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/11/bill-de-blasio-2020-1213856\">told </a><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/11/bill-de-blasio-2020-1213856\"><i>Politico</i></a> that his flirtation with a presidential run was &ldquo;fucking insane.&rdquo; De Blasio&rsquo;s wife, Chirlane McCray, has said the &ldquo;timing is not exactly right&rdquo; for him to launch a campaign. <i>The New York Times</i>, which seems to take gleeful pleasure in dinging de Blasio for everything from calling <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/nyregion/school-snow-day-nyc.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2Fde%20Blasio%2C%20Bill&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=15&pgtype=collection\">errant snow days</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/nyregion/iowa-bill-de-blasio-2020.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2Fde%20Blasio%2C%20Bill&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=23&pgtype=collection\">ostentatiously hanging around Iowa</a>, recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/nyregion/pete-buttigieg-2020-de-blasio-mayor.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2Fde%20Blasio%2C%20Bill&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=4&pgtype=collection\">noted</a> that Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has generated far more presidential buzz than the mayor of the country&rsquo;s biggest city. Even in his hometown, there seems to be only one person who thinks a de Blasio presidential campaign would be anything other than a joke: de Blasio himself.</p>\n<aside>Even the mayor&rsquo;s own allies told <i>Politico </i>that his flirtation with a presidential run was &ldquo;fucking insane.&rdquo;</aside>\n<p>How did he fall so far? De Blasio does, after all, have a robust record of actual accomplishments under his belt, which is more than what can be said for, say, Beto O&rsquo;Rourke. He was once the favorite of <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bill-de-blasio-mayoral-win-signals-working-families-party-ascendancy\">grassroots groups</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/bill-de-blasio-mayor/\">leftist elites</a> alike. Perhaps the left soured on him because he is a singularly ham-handed politician, who possesses all the native charm of a Howard Schultz, the billionaire Starbucks founder who is trying to win the presidency one sanctimonious tweet at a time. Perhaps de Blasio has never been as progressive as his early cheerleaders made him out to be; he might simply be an opportunist who saw, early on, the way the wind was blowing and adjusted accordingly. Or maybe the Democrats, unnerved by the disaster of the last election and fearing another Trump victory in 2020, have started to prefer candidates who are all promise and no baggage.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, de Blasio was always a strange fit to lead a revived left. He came up through the New York Democratic establishment, serving as the 1994 campaign manager for the legendary, ethically challenged U.S. Representative Charlie Rangel and for Clinton during her 2000 Senate run. At the same time, his 2013 campaign was memorable for fringe positions well beyond the scope of even the modern-day left, particularly his call to curb the city&rsquo;s horse-carriage industry (a coalition including animal-rights activists spent $1 million attacking Quinn during the primary and were an energetic force behind de Blasio&rsquo;s election). He was a weird mix, beholden to certain entrenched industries&mdash;most notably <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/nyregion/homeless-buildings-sold-de-blasio-democrats.html\">real estate</a>, which has only further exacerbated the city&rsquo;s wildly unequal political economy&mdash;but comfortable occupying the party&rsquo;s left flank.</p>\n<p>But de Blasio did represent one clear change: He was not Michael Bloomberg. More than anything, his reputation as a left reformer stemmed from his position on overhauling the New York City Police Department and checking stop-and-frisk, a desperately needed corrective that tied in neatly with his own story as the head of a mixed-race family. The race against Quinn really turned after de Blasio ran <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgvXniTz7D8\">an ad</a> narrated by his teenage son Dante, which made plain that stop-and-frisk was personal for him. The city&rsquo;s minority communities, a crucial voting bloc, swung for de Blasio in a big way. And while de Blasio is now better known for his gaffes and general awkwardness&mdash;a kind of real-life Gumby who accidentally kills groundhogs and works out in knee-length cargo shorts&mdash;he was once seen as charismatic, his whole family drawing cheers for a dance called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjhWlRBiWoo\">The Smackdown</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/52a58f7532a7f79db9278b9114bbf7314e0b2e5f.jpeg?w=800&q=65&dpi=1&fm=pjpg&h=512\"></img><figcaption>De Blasio and his multiracial family used to be darlings of the New York press.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Upon assuming office in 2014, he quickly racked up some big wins, no small feat in a city that had seen decades of centrist-to-conservative rule (before Bloomberg there was Rudy Giuliani, who is now busy incompetently covering up Donald Trump&rsquo;s various alleged crimes and misdemeanors on television). Furthermore, de Blasio did all this while toiling in the substantial shadow of New York&rsquo;s conservative Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, an erstwhile ally who has a habit of <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/143869/andrew-cuomo-keeps-left-check\">undercutting left-leaning priorities</a> and who eventually became de Blasio&rsquo;s ruthless tormentor. The two of them sparred in the city&rsquo;s overheated mediasphere over a vast array of tabloid-friendly issues, such as topless women in Times Square, the death of a deer, and the city&rsquo;s decrepit subway system.</p>\n<p>But before de Blasio and Cuomo well and fully fell out, de Blasio managed to push through his universal pre-K plan, enrolling some 70,000 children in over two years, equivalent to three-quarters of the entire population of South Bend. He made <a href=\"https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/09/06/new-york-city-unveils-universal-free-lunch-in-time-for-the-first-day-of-school/\">free lunch</a> available to all public school students. He raised the minimum wage for city workers to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/nyregion/mayor-to-raise-base-pay-for-city-workers-15-an-hour.html\">$15 an hour</a> and has put forward a proposal for New York City employers to provide <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/01/09/de-blasio-city-will-mandate-paid-time-off-for-all-workers-782443\">paid sick leave</a> to their workers. He made good on his promise to provide municipal ID cards for undocumented immigrants, allowing them to obtain services that were previously unavailable to them, such as opening bank accounts or accessing public libraries.</p>\n<p>Yet none of this has added up to the reputation of an accomplished mayor. Why not?</p>\n<p>To start, de Blasio has a terrible relationship with the press, which is as much de Blasio&rsquo;s fault as it is the handiwork of New York&rsquo;s scandal-happy media scene. De Blasio has a penchant for talking down to journalists, such as when he sullenly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/07/nyregion/de-blasio-snubs-new-york-post.html\">told</a> a <i>New York Post</i> reporter that he had &ldquo;no use for a right-wing rag that attacks people who are good public servants and tries to undermine their reputation.&rdquo; In the wake of such outbursts, both liberal and conservative papers love to drag their mayor, which is why the first image New Yorkers have of de Blasio is not of him cutting the ribbon on a new pre-K school, but of him being chauffeured in a black SUV across town to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-climate-cars.html\">the Park Slope YMCA</a> to work out. It is a habit that he apparently believes keeps him in touch with his middle-class roots&mdash;which serves as a perfect, if inadvertent, example of how de Blasio&rsquo;s own cluelessness and the press&rsquo;s venom combine to ratchet up his reputation for self-righteous victimhood.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I would argue that de Blasio has had many strong successful progressive policies, more so than many of the other candidates running in the race,&rdquo; Rebecca Katz, a former top adviser to de Blasio&rsquo;s 2013 campaign, told me. &ldquo;But most of that is overshadowed by his toxic relationship with the press corps that covers him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to determine when exactly it all went south with the press, but the 2016 primary between Clinton and Sanders was definitely a turning point. In what came off as a real-life equivalent of the <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/distracted-boyfriend\">distracted boyfriend meme</a>, de Blasio held off endorsing his former boss for six months, as he gazed longingly at the Sanders campaign and the stir it was creating on the left. He created a nonprofit group, Progressive Agenda, that reportedly spent nearly $900,000 to boost his policy priorities on income inequality&mdash;in part by sponsoring a presidential forum in Iowa that was eventually canceled because so few candidates agreed to attend. As <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2018/10/18/fiasco-the-short-life-and-ignominious-death-of-de-blasios-national-progressive-agenda-656961\"><i>Politico</i> later reported</a>, &ldquo;The mayor&rsquo;s role in the event seemed the biggest hurdle in getting others to sign on.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside>For someone who wanted to play kingmaker, de Blasio transformed his 2016 campaign misadventures into a long and largely pointless show of penance.</aside>\n<p>His foray into national politics ended disastrously when he ended up backing Clinton anyway, sending a convoluted message of where his loyalties lay. Though he officially endorsed Clinton, it was evident that his reluctance was meant to pull her campaign further left. The result was a failed accommodation to the Democratic frontrunner that, for de Blasio, represented the worst of both worlds: He simultaneously seemed to spurn the Sanders left while angering the Clinton establishment for dragging his feet. For someone who wanted to play kingmaker, de Blasio transformed his 2016 campaign misadventures into a long and largely pointless show of penance, wandering the cold streets of Iowa to knock on doors for Clinton.</p>\n<p>In addition to revealing that he is not the most nimble politician, the Iowa debacle made clear that de Blasio wants very badly to be a national figure&mdash;and New York&rsquo;s hostile press has gleefully flogged this uncomplimentary storyline ever since. Most members of New York&rsquo;s press corps don&rsquo;t like the idea that their city is playing second fiddle (even if it is to the nation as a whole), and so they routinely accuse de Blasio of putting his own ambitions above the city&rsquo;s concerns. The perception that de Blasio thinks he&rsquo;s too good for New York has dragged down his poll numbers, with a full <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/new-york-city/release-detail?ReleaseID=2613\">76 percent</a> of New Yorkers saying he should stay home rather than run for president.</p>\n<p>And the will-he-or-won&rsquo;t-he dance with Clinton suggested that de Blasio was just another on-the-make political opportunist, with a commitment to left politics that&rsquo;s purely conditional. That seemed to dispel the &ldquo;tale of two cities&rdquo; mystique once and for all.</p>\n<p>Was de Blasio ever that liberal to begin with? His critics say no, that he&rsquo;s always been the regular old typecast of a calculating politician. It&rsquo;s impossible to ignore the distinctly Dickensian feel of New York City in the de Blasio years. New York&rsquo;s education system remains one of the most segregated in the country. Rikers Island, the city&rsquo;s notoriously abusive jail complex, won&rsquo;t be fully shuttered until 2027. And while much of the blame for the crumbling subway system goes to Andrew Cuomo and the state government in Albany, de Blasio has not escaped the ire of the city&rsquo;s millions of commuters. After he made a big deal about riding the subway once to show solidarity with disgruntled straphangers, Splinter&rsquo;s Hamilton Nolan <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/bill-de-blasio-try-riding-the-subway-every-day-you-tall-1833129703\">wrote</a>, &ldquo;Wow!!! Break out the cameras!!! Mr. Mayor, I want to see you in the god damn tunnel for the next seven hundred days of your term or fuck off man.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>De Blasio has also taken a lot of heat for the city&rsquo;s housing crisis. He may have done more than his predecessors to address the wretchedly unequal state of New York housing, but advocates regularly blame him for cutting deals that give too much away to developers at the expense of low-income New Yorkers. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s where de Blasio&rsquo;s values and ideals come into contradiction with his actions,&rdquo; Jonathan Westin, executive director of New York Communities for Change, told me, pointing out the <a href=\"http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/7360-brooklyn-armory-deal-and-larger-de-blasio-development-debate-move-toward-term-two\">Bedford-Union Armory deal</a> that granted public land in Crown Heights to a private developer. &ldquo;He still wanted to be mayor and govern in a similar fashion to Bloomberg. That&rsquo;s clearly a big contradiction towards where the Democratic Party is going.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>His administration has also made a hash of the New York City Housing Authority, which provides housing for more than 400,000 residents and is mired in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/nyregion/nycha-lead-paint.html\">lead paint scandals</a> and chronic <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2018/12/03/patterson_houses_nycha_bronx_running_water.php\">heat and hot water failures</a>. NYCHA&rsquo;s problems stem from decades of funding cuts both at the <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/housing-is-the-key-to-unlocking-andrew-cuomos-political-1825236190\">federal and state level</a>, but critics have also called out de Blasio for general neglect. &ldquo;If we want to talk about being a progressive mayor, part of progressivism is having those conversations of big bold ideas,&rdquo; Afua Atta-Mensah, executive director of Community Voices Heard, told me. &ldquo;Where is the battle cry of we&rsquo;re going to get everyone in a room and save NYCHA?&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/85a5fbc6981d166b512f2687df966838c8ce586d.jpeg?w=800&q=65&dpi=1&fm=pjpg&h=533\"></img><figcaption>De Blasio has often found himself stymied by Governor Andrew Cuomo, the more powerful Democrat in New York State.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>De Blasio has handled these accusations with his usual aplomb. When activists confronted him at his Park Slope gym about his administration&rsquo;s lack of attention to the homeless, de Blasio <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/nyregion/de-blasio-homeless-gym.html\">answered</a>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the middle of a workout.&rdquo; (De Blasio&rsquo;s office declined a request for public comment.)</p>\n<p>The mayor has also struggled to uphold his promises to reform the NYPD. Stop-and-frisks are down from a high of 685,000 in 2011 to just 10,861 in 2017, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cssny.org/news/entry/stop-and-frisk\">Community Service Society</a>, thanks in part to a judge&rsquo;s ruling that the practice was unconstitutional. But racial disparities persist, and transparency and accountability within the police force remain elusive. According to a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kendalltaggart/secret-nypd-files-hundreds-of-officers-committed-serious#.fw6YwZzgB\">BuzzFeed report</a> last year, hundreds of police officers remain in their jobs even after committing offenses serious enough to justify their firing. And brutal policing is still a ubiquitous fact of life for New Yorkers of color&mdash;just a few months ago, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/09/nyregion/nypd-jazmine-headley-baby-video.html\">video circulated</a> of NYPD officers wrenching a one-year-old son from the arms of his mother, Jazmine Headley, after someone called the cops on her for sitting on the floor of a food stamp office because there were no chairs available.</p>\n<p>For many on the left, the disappointments with de Blasio came long before his blundering tour through Iowa in 2016. They point, first off, to the people he chose to run his administration. There was the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/nyregion/william-bratton-new-york-city-police-commissioner.html\">appointment of Bill Bratton</a> as police commissioner, who was infamous for popularizing the &ldquo;broken windows&rdquo; style of policing that fueled misdemeanor arrests of people of color. De Blasio also put Alicia Glen, a former Goldman Sachs executive, in charge of his housing program. &ldquo;When we look at the current landscape of the Democratic Party, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would never do something like that,&rdquo; said Westin of the New York Communities for Change. &ldquo;From the very beginning of [de Blasio&rsquo;s] administration he kind of signaled that he wasn&rsquo;t actually going to be the progressive stalwart that he ran on.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With de Blasio, he&rsquo;s progressive, within reach,&rdquo; said Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University. &ldquo;The very base that gives him his progressive credibility&mdash;which I would argue are people of color, primarily black Americans&mdash;when you sift through some of his policies, he&rsquo;s actually not that progressive.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It hasn&rsquo;t helped de Blasio that the left has found new champions in politicians like Ocasio-Coretz and Sanders, both of whom seem more committed to the cause. There was perhaps no starker illustration of this contrast than when de Blasio and Cuomo finally buried the hatchet to engineer a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/nyregion/amazon-nyc-cuomo-de-blasio.html\">backroom deal</a> to bring an Amazon headquarters to Long Island City in Queens. Grassroots organizers, embittered City Council members, newly elected members of the Democratic state Senate, and Ocasio-Cortez herself <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/02/14/how-amazons-big-plans-new-york-city-were-thwarted-by-citys-resurgent-left-wing/?utm_term=.ecc285e06f1f\">all closed ranks against the plan</a>. They cried foul over the billions of dollars in subsidies to the tech giant, the inevitable gentrification that would come with Amazon&rsquo;s headquarters, and the failure of the politicians teeing up the deal to consult with the communities that would be most affected by these upheavals prior to signing on.</p>\n<p>Amazon ended up withdrawing from Long Island City in response to the backlash from the left. At the eleventh hour, De Blasio tried to switch <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/nyregion/de-blasio-amazon-hq2.html\">sides</a>, criticizing Amazon&rsquo;s decision to bail as &ldquo;the 1 percent dictating to everyone else.&rdquo; It was too little, too late. As Jose Cabrera, co-chair of the Queens branch of the Democratic Socialists of America, told <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/nyregion/de-blasio-amazon-hq2.html\"><i>The New York Times</i></a>, &ldquo;It seems that he&rsquo;s a little bit torn on who he wants to be.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For these and many other reasons, the people who know de Blasio best say he should sit 2020 out. When reporters recently noted that more than three-quarters of New Yorkers think a presidential run is a bad idea, he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-2020.html\">dryly responded</a>, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I could unify the people of New York City.&rdquo;</p>\n<aside>Has governing experience in the age of Trump become a source of political liability rather than a basic qualification for office?</aside>\n<p>But underneath that sardonic exterior, de Blasio seems undaunted. He has moved his communications director Mike Casca, who worked on Bernie Sanders&rsquo;s 2016 presidential campaign, to his Fairness PAC, which funds national Democratic candidates as well as his own non-mayoral political activities. &ldquo;I have spent a lot of time in dead last in many a poll in many a race,&rdquo; he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-2020.html\">told </a><i>The New York Times</i> in January. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not where you start. It&rsquo;s where you end.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The cruel irony for Bill de Blasio is that he may already be at the end of what has become a familiar cycle. He started with glowing press coverage, a fresh face with an alluring personal story to boot. He was then subject to the media&rsquo;s unrelenting, unforgiving gaze, which exposed not a few blemishes. And he made some mistakes and bad compromises, as politicians are wont to do. Now Democratic voters have moved on to the next potential savior, practically begging de Blasio to take a seat. And the party&rsquo;s seeming preemptive rejection of a de Blasio run raises a larger, more discomfiting question: Has governing experience in the age of Trump become a source of political liability rather than a basic qualification for office?</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s undeniable that de Blasio has more accomplishments than many of his would-be presidential rivals&mdash;accomplishments that were secured despite the almost pathological animosity of a far more powerful figure in Governor Cuomo. Pete Buttigieg, for example, couldn&rsquo;t even make it through the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/pete-buttigieg-dnc-chair-race-235393\">first round of votes</a> in his bid to become Democratic National Committee chair two years ago. Yet he is now in the top three in the latest Iowa <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aseitzwald/status/1116387014742552576\">poll</a>, ahead of both Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren. Buttigieg&rsquo;s main selling points are that he would be the first openly gay presidential candidate and that he turned around a small Rust Belt city that had been in decline, but his record clearly doesn&rsquo;t touch the breadth of de Blasio&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s Beto O&rsquo;Rourke, a top contender despite having a paper-thin record&mdash;and what record he does have is decidedly centrist. As a U.S. representative, he voted with Trump <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/beto-orourke/\">nearly one-third</a> of the time, including on issues ranging from immigration to taxes, despite representing a solidly Democratic district. He also received the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=E01&cycle=2018&recipdetail=A&sortorder=U\">second-most donations</a> from the oil and gas industry of any Senate candidate in 2018&mdash;not unusual for a Texas Democrat, but problematic for a presidential candidate.</p>\n<p>De Blasio, of course, would also be competing with candidates who do have formidable records: Elizabeth Warren, Sanders, potentially Joe Biden. Some voters may prefer O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s middle-ground tendencies and Buttigieg&rsquo;s cerebral earnestness and red-state bona fides; others may think Warren or Sanders are better representative of the left. But that can&rsquo;t explain the veritable anti-buzz that surrounds a de Blasio run, while everyone else gets at least a turn in the warm glow of the national spotlight. If gaffes are such a problem, then why is Biden, a walking lawsuit waiting to happen, at or near the top of the polls?</p>\n<p>Perhaps the real problem for de Blasio is that Donald Trump obliterated the idea that traditional qualifications&mdash;governing experience, policy expertise, deal-making&mdash;are a prerequisite for winning the presidency. Clinton, after all, had all those qualities in spades, and look what that did for her, not to mention the country. What matters, first and foremost, is that you win&mdash;which is why Democratic voters have become obsessed with that old chestnut, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/in-2020-democrats-could-experience-trump-reelection-panic.html\">electability</a>. And as Trump himself showed, sometimes the most electable politician is the one who has never done anything at all.</p>\n<p>*<i>A previous version of this article stated that Michael Bloomberg endorsed Christine Quinn in the 2013 mayoral race.

                "text": "It may be hard to believe now, but for a New York minute it seemed that Bill de Blasio was going to be the champion of an insurgent left. Progressive activists and commentators hailed de Blasio\u2019s landslide victory in New York\u2019s 2013 mayoral election as a sign of an encouraging new direction for the Democratic Party. His unabashedly liberal campaign\u2014which centered on income inequality, or what de Blasio poetically termed a \u201ctale of two cities\u201d\u2014prefigured the unrest that would shake the party, culminating in Bernie Sanders\u2019s unlikely challenge to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primary.\nDe Blasio\u2019s 2013 platform, which The New York Times called \u201cthe meatiest material presented by any candidate\u201d in the field, sounded themes that are now standard fare for Democrats with national ambitions. He promised a universal pre-kindergarten program, paid for by a tax on the wealthy; an identification card that would allow undocumented immigrants to access city services; an ambitious plan to build or preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing; and reform of stop-and-frisk, the Bloomberg-era program that effectively allowed police to target minorities with warrantless searches. \u201cGovernment must focus on the needs of families, must be the protector of neighborhoods, and must guard the people from the enormous power of moneyed interests,\u201d de Blasio thundered in his campaign announcement.\nDemocratic voters rebuked twelve years of plutocratic rule by handing de Blasio a primary victory over the Bloomberg-favored Christine Quinn.* As Peter Beinart wrote in The Daily Beast, \u201cDe Blasio\u2019s victory is an omen of what may become the defining story of America\u2019s next political era: the challenge, to both parties, from the left.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge Hillary Clinton should start worrying about now.\u201d\nYet as de Blasio weighs entering the 2020 race, the prospect of a President de Blasio has been met with widespread derision. The New Republic\u2019s Alex Shephard termed his interest in the presidency an \u201cembarrassing quest for national fame,\u201d while the mayor\u2019s own allies (anonymously) told Politico that his flirtation with a presidential run was \u201cfucking insane.\u201d De Blasio\u2019s wife, Chirlane McCray, has said the \u201ctiming is not exactly right\u201d for him to launch a campaign. The New York Times, which seems to take gleeful pleasure in dinging de Blasio for everything from calling errant snow days to ostentatiously hanging around Iowa, recently noted that Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has generated far more presidential buzz than the mayor of the country\u2019s biggest city. Even in his hometown, there seems to be only one person who thinks a de Blasio presidential campaign would be anything other than a joke: de Blasio himself.\nEven the mayor\u2019s own allies told Politico that his flirtation with a presidential run was \u201cfucking insane.\u201d\nHow did he fall so far? De Blasio does, after all, have a robust record of actual accomplishments under his belt, which is more than what can be said for, say, Beto O\u2019Rourke. He was once the favorite of grassroots groups and leftist elites alike. Perhaps the left soured on him because he is a singularly ham-handed politician, who possesses all the native charm of a Howard Schultz, the billionaire Starbucks founder who is trying to win the presidency one sanctimonious tweet at a time. Perhaps de Blasio has never been as progressive as his early cheerleaders made him out to be; he might simply be an opportunist who saw, early on, the way the wind was blowing and adjusted accordingly. Or maybe the Democrats, unnerved by the disaster of the last election and fearing another Trump victory in 2020, have started to prefer candidates who are all promise and no baggage.\nIn retrospect, de Blasio was always a strange fit to lead a revived left. He came up through the New York Democratic establishment, serving as the 1994 campaign manager for the legendary, ethically challenged U.S. Representative Charlie Rangel and for Clinton during her 2000 Senate run. At the same time, his 2013 campaign was memorable for fringe positions well beyond the scope of even the modern-day left, particularly his call to curb the city\u2019s horse-carriage industry (a coalition including animal-rights activists spent $1 million attacking Quinn during the primary and were an energetic force behind de Blasio\u2019s election). He was a weird mix, beholden to certain entrenched industries\u2014most notably real estate, which has only further exacerbated the city\u2019s wildly unequal political economy\u2014but comfortable occupying the party\u2019s left flank.\nBut de Blasio did represent one clear change: He was not Michael Bloomberg. More than anything, his reputation as a left reformer stemmed from his position on overhauling the New York City Police Department and checking stop-and-frisk, a desperately needed corrective that tied in neatly with his own story as the head of a mixed-race family. The race against Quinn really turned after de Blasio ran an ad narrated by his teenage son Dante, which made plain that stop-and-frisk was personal for him. The city\u2019s minority communities, a crucial voting bloc, swung for de Blasio in a big way. And while de Blasio is now better known for his gaffes and general awkwardness\u2014a kind of real-life Gumby who accidentally kills groundhogs and works out in knee-length cargo shorts\u2014he was once seen as charismatic, his whole family drawing cheers for a dance called The Smackdown.\nUpon assuming office in 2014, he quickly racked up some big wins, no small feat in a city that had seen decades of centrist-to-conservative rule (before Bloomberg there was Rudy Giuliani, who is now busy incompetently covering up Donald Trump\u2019s various alleged crimes and misdemeanors on television). Furthermore, de Blasio did all this while toiling in the substantial shadow of New York\u2019s conservative Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, an erstwhile ally who has a habit of undercutting left-leaning priorities and who eventually became de Blasio\u2019s ruthless tormentor. The two of them sparred in the city\u2019s overheated mediasphere over a vast array of tabloid-friendly issues, such as topless women in Times Square, the death of a deer, and the city\u2019s decrepit subway system.\nBut before de Blasio and Cuomo well and fully fell out, de Blasio managed to push through his universal pre-K plan, enrolling some 70,000 children in over two years, equivalent to three-quarters of the entire population of South Bend. He made free lunch available to all public school students. He raised the minimum wage for city workers to $15 an hour and has put forward a proposal for New York City employers to provide paid sick leave to their workers. He made good on his promise to provide municipal ID cards for undocumented immigrants, allowing them to obtain services that were previously unavailable to them, such as opening bank accounts or accessing public libraries.\nYet none of this has added up to the reputation of an accomplished mayor. Why not?\nTo start, de Blasio has a terrible relationship with the press, which is as much de Blasio\u2019s fault as it is the handiwork of New York\u2019s scandal-happy media scene. De Blasio has a penchant for talking down to journalists, such as when he sullenly told a New York Post reporter that he had \u201cno use for a right-wing rag that attacks people who are good public servants and tries to undermine their reputation.\u201d In the wake of such outbursts, both liberal and conservative papers love to drag their mayor, which is why the first image New Yorkers have of de Blasio is not of him cutting the ribbon on a new pre-K school, but of him being chauffeured in a black SUV across town to the Park Slope YMCA to work out. It is a habit that he apparently believes keeps him in touch with his middle-class roots\u2014which serves as a perfect, if inadvertent, example of how de Blasio\u2019s own cluelessness and the press\u2019s venom combine to ratchet up his reputation for self-righteous victimhood.\n\u201cI would argue that de Blasio has had many strong successful progressive policies, more so than many of the other candidates running in the race,\u201d Rebecca Katz, a former top adviser to de Blasio\u2019s 2013 campaign, told me. \u201cBut most of that is overshadowed by his toxic relationship with the press corps that covers him.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to determine when exactly it all went south with the press, but the 2016 primary between Clinton and Sanders was definitely a turning point. In what came off as a real-life equivalent of the distracted boyfriend meme, de Blasio held off endorsing his former boss for six months, as he gazed longingly at the Sanders campaign and the stir it was creating on the left. He created a nonprofit group, Progressive Agenda, that reportedly spent nearly $900,000 to boost his policy priorities on income inequality\u2014in part by sponsoring a presidential forum in Iowa that was eventually canceled because so few candidates agreed to attend. As Politico later reported, \u201cThe mayor\u2019s role in the event seemed the biggest hurdle in getting others to sign on.\u201d\nFor someone who wanted to play kingmaker, de Blasio transformed his 2016 campaign misadventures into a long and largely pointless show of penance.\nHis foray into national politics ended disastrously when he ended up backing Clinton anyway, sending a convoluted message of where his loyalties lay. Though he officially endorsed Clinton, it was evident that his reluctance was meant to pull her campaign further left. The result was a failed accommodation to the Democratic frontrunner that, for de Blasio, represented the worst of both worlds: He simultaneously seemed to spurn the Sanders left while angering the Clinton establishment for dragging his feet. For someone who wanted to play kingmaker, de Blasio transformed his 2016 campaign misadventures into a long and largely pointless show of penance, wandering the cold streets of Iowa to knock on doors for Clinton.\nIn addition to revealing that he is not the most nimble politician, the Iowa debacle made clear that de Blasio wants very badly to be a national figure\u2014and New York\u2019s hostile press has gleefully flogged this uncomplimentary storyline ever since. Most members of New York\u2019s press corps don\u2019t like the idea that their city is playing second fiddle (even if it is to the nation as a whole), and so they routinely accuse de Blasio of putting his own ambitions above the city\u2019s concerns. The perception that de Blasio thinks he\u2019s too good for New York has dragged down his poll numbers, with a full 76 percent of New Yorkers saying he should stay home rather than run for president.\nAnd the will-he-or-won\u2019t-he dance with Clinton suggested that de Blasio was just another on-the-make political opportunist, with a commitment to left politics that\u2019s purely conditional. That seemed to dispel the \u201ctale of two cities\u201d mystique once and for all.\nWas de Blasio ever that liberal to begin with? His critics say no, that he\u2019s always been the regular old typecast of a calculating politician. It\u2019s impossible to ignore the distinctly Dickensian feel of New York City in the de Blasio years. New York\u2019s education system remains one of the most segregated in the country. Rikers Island, the city\u2019s notoriously abusive jail complex, won\u2019t be fully shuttered until 2027. And while much of the blame for the crumbling subway system goes to Andrew Cuomo and the state government in Albany, de Blasio has not escaped the ire of the city\u2019s millions of commuters. After he made a big deal about riding the subway once to show solidarity with disgruntled straphangers, Splinter\u2019s Hamilton Nolan wrote, \u201cWow!!! Break out the cameras!!! Mr. Mayor, I want to see you in the god damn tunnel for the next seven hundred days of your term or fuck off man.\u201d\nDe Blasio has also taken a lot of heat for the city\u2019s housing crisis. He may have done more than his predecessors to address the wretchedly unequal state of New York housing, but advocates regularly blame him for cutting deals that give too much away to developers at the expense of low-income New Yorkers. \u201cI think that\u2019s where de Blasio\u2019s values and ideals come into contradiction with his actions,\u201d Jonathan Westin, executive director of New York Communities for Change, told me, pointing out the Bedford-Union Armory deal that granted public land in Crown Heights to a private developer. \u201cHe still wanted to be mayor and govern in a similar fashion to Bloomberg. That\u2019s clearly a big contradiction towards where the Democratic Party is going.\u201d\nHis administration has also made a hash of the New York City Housing Authority, which provides housing for more than 400,000 residents and is mired in lead paint scandals and chronic heat and hot water failures. NYCHA\u2019s problems stem from decades of funding cuts both at the federal and state level, but critics have also called out de Blasio for general neglect. \u201cIf we want to talk about being a progressive mayor, part of progressivism is having those conversations of big bold ideas,\u201d Afua Atta-Mensah, executive director of Community Voices Heard, told me. \u201cWhere is the battle cry of we\u2019re going to get everyone in a room and save NYCHA?\u201d\nDe Blasio has handled these accusations with his usual aplomb. When activists confronted him at his Park Slope gym about his administration\u2019s lack of attention to the homeless, de Blasio answered: \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of a workout.\u201d (De Blasio\u2019s office declined a request for public comment.)\nThe mayor has also struggled to uphold his promises to reform the NYPD. Stop-and-frisks are down from a high of 685,000 in 2011 to just 10,861 in 2017, according to the Community Service Society, thanks in part to a judge\u2019s ruling that the practice was unconstitutional. But racial disparities persist, and transparency and accountability within the police force remain elusive. According to a BuzzFeed report last year, hundreds of police officers remain in their jobs even after committing offenses serious enough to justify their firing. And brutal policing is still a ubiquitous fact of life for New Yorkers of color\u2014just a few months ago, video circulated of NYPD officers wrenching a one-year-old son from the arms of his mother, Jazmine Headley, after someone called the cops on her for sitting on the floor of a food stamp office because there were no chairs available.\nFor many on the left, the disappointments with de Blasio came long before his blundering tour through Iowa in 2016. They point, first off, to the people he chose to run his administration. There was the appointment of Bill Bratton as police commissioner, who was infamous for popularizing the \u201cbroken windows\u201d style of policing that fueled misdemeanor arrests of people of color. De Blasio also put Alicia Glen, a former Goldman Sachs executive, in charge of his housing program. \u201cWhen we look at the current landscape of the Democratic Party, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would never do something like that,\u201d said Westin of the New York Communities for Change. \u201cFrom the very beginning of [de Blasio\u2019s] administration he kind of signaled that he wasn\u2019t actually going to be the progressive stalwart that he ran on.\u201d\n\u201cWith de Blasio, he\u2019s progressive, within reach,\u201d said Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University. \u201cThe very base that gives him his progressive credibility\u2014which I would argue are people of color, primarily black Americans\u2014when you sift through some of his policies, he\u2019s actually not that progressive.\u201d\nIt hasn\u2019t helped de Blasio that the left has found new champions in politicians like Ocasio-Coretz and Sanders, both of whom seem more committed to the cause. There was perhaps no starker illustration of this contrast than when de Blasio and Cuomo finally buried the hatchet to engineer a backroom deal to bring an Amazon headquarters to Long Island City in Queens. Grassroots organizers, embittered City Council members, newly elected members of the Democratic state Senate, and Ocasio-Cortez herself all closed ranks against the plan. They cried foul over the billions of dollars in subsidies to the tech giant, the inevitable gentrification that would come with Amazon\u2019s headquarters, and the failure of the politicians teeing up the deal to consult with the communities that would be most affected by these upheavals prior to signing on.\nAmazon ended up withdrawing from Long Island City in response to the backlash from the left. At the eleventh hour, De Blasio tried to switch sides, criticizing Amazon\u2019s decision to bail as \u201cthe 1 percent dictating to everyone else.\u201d It was too little, too late. As Jose Cabrera, co-chair of the Queens branch of the Democratic Socialists of America, told The New York Times, \u201cIt seems that he\u2019s a little bit torn on who he wants to be.\u201d\nFor these and many other reasons, the people who know de Blasio best say he should sit 2020 out. When reporters recently noted that more than three-quarters of New Yorkers think a presidential run is a bad idea, he dryly responded, \u201cI\u2019m glad I could unify the people of New York City.\u201d\nHas governing experience in the age of Trump become a source of political liability rather than a basic qualification for office?\nBut underneath that sardonic exterior, de Blasio seems undaunted. He has moved his communications director Mike Casca, who worked on Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, to his Fairness PAC, which funds national Democratic candidates as well as his own non-mayoral political activities. \u201cI have spent a lot of time in dead last in many a poll in many a race,\u201d he told The New York Times in January. \u201cIt\u2019s not where you start. It\u2019s where you end.\u201d\nThe cruel irony for Bill de Blasio is that he may already be at the end of what has become a familiar cycle. He started with glowing press coverage, a fresh face with an alluring personal story to boot. He was then subject to the media\u2019s unrelenting, unforgiving gaze, which exposed not a few blemishes. And he made some mistakes and bad compromises, as politicians are wont to do. Now Democratic voters have moved on to the next potential savior, practically begging de Blasio to take a seat. And the party\u2019s seeming preemptive rejection of a de Blasio run raises a larger, more discomfiting question: Has governing experience in the age of Trump become a source of political liability rather than a basic qualification for office?\nIt\u2019s undeniable that de Blasio has more accomplishments than many of his would-be presidential rivals\u2014accomplishments that were secured despite the almost pathological animosity of a far more powerful figure in Governor Cuomo. Pete Buttigieg, for example, couldn\u2019t even make it through the first round of votes in his bid to become Democratic National Committee chair two years ago. Yet he is now in the top three in the latest Iowa poll, ahead of both Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren. Buttigieg\u2019s main selling points are that he would be the first openly gay presidential candidate and that he turned around a small Rust Belt city that had been in decline, but his record clearly doesn\u2019t touch the breadth of de Blasio\u2019s.\nThen there\u2019s Beto O\u2019Rourke, a top contender despite having a paper-thin record\u2014and what record he does have is decidedly centrist. As a U.S. representative, he voted with Trump nearly one-third of the time, including on issues ranging from immigration to taxes, despite representing a solidly Democratic district. He also received the second-most donations from the oil and gas industry of any Senate candidate in 2018\u2014not unusual for a Texas Democrat, but problematic for a presidential candidate.\nDe Blasio, of course, would also be competing with candidates who do have formidable records: Elizabeth Warren, Sanders, potentially Joe Biden. Some voters may prefer O\u2019Rourke\u2019s middle-ground tendencies and Buttigieg\u2019s cerebral earnestness and red-state bona fides; others may think Warren or Sanders are better representative of the left. But that can\u2019t explain the veritable anti-buzz that surrounds a de Blasio run, while everyone else gets at least a turn in the warm glow of the national spotlight. If gaffes are such a problem, then why is Biden, a walking lawsuit waiting to happen, at or near the top of the polls?\nPerhaps the real problem for de Blasio is that Donald Trump obliterated the idea that traditional qualifications\u2014governing experience, policy expertise, deal-making\u2014are a prerequisite for winning the presidency. Clinton, after all, had all those qualities in spades, and look what that did for her, not to mention the country. What matters, first and foremost, is that you win\u2014which is why Democratic voters have become obsessed with that old chestnut, electability. And as Trump himself showed, sometimes the most electable politician is the one who has never done anything at all.\n*A previous version of this article stated that Michael Bloomberg endorsed Christine Quinn in the 2013 mayoral race. He declined to officially endorse anyone, but publicly praised Quinn after she supported his controversial bid for a third term. We regret the error.",

Prince Genji, a secondary son of the emperor who is made a commoner so he won&rsquo;t be threatened at court, is possessed of an astonishing beauty from birth. A traveling physiognomist declares him &ldquo;destined to become the father of his people.&rdquo; His nickname is The Shining Lord. Genji is so hot that men repeatedly wish he was a woman (Heian beauty standards ran androgynous). He excels at literally everything from playing the stringed koto to collecting paintings and writing poetry, not to mention constantly seducing women with his immaculate taste, only to kind of ignore them after installing them in a mansion somewhere.</p>\n<p>In the Heian period, when Buddhism was first becoming the land&rsquo;s principal religion, beauty was a moral force: The more beauty in this life, the better karma the person must have had in a previous life to deserve it, and vice versa. The best poem, painting, color-coordinated robe&mdash;these were all aesthetically as well as spiritually appealing in a kind of religiously validated, feudalist consumerism. And Prince Genji was the epitome of both.</p>\n<p>In a dim, sectioned gallery like the chambers of a traditional Japanese house, the Metropolitan Museum has collected a <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/tale-of-genji\">Genji-themed exhibition</a> that&rsquo;s as glittering and various as the novel itself, featuring illuminated scrolls, engraved book containers, and folding screens all depicting the book&rsquo;s pivotal scenes. The artwork is the result of centuries of fandom, hand-copying the tale from one generation to the next. Genji&rsquo;s Heian-ideal face&mdash;a round, pallid visage with high, bushy eyebrows and a pouty mouth&mdash;shines out from all of them. He was never emperor, but the fictional prince did become the father of his people (as well as some possibly illegitimate children) through art rather than politics. The exhibition presents the novel as a wellspring of culture similar to the Bible and western art, if Jesus had been all about promiscuous sex and choosing which incense to perfume your robes with based on the season.</p>\n<p>Rather than life-or-death decisions, the vast majority of the characters&rsquo; trials center on quoting an appropriate poem or knowing when to follow up with an absent lover. The Heian conflation of taste, ethics, and identity, not to mention their preoccupation with sending each other poem fragments like so many text messages and then fretting about not getting replies, wasn&rsquo;t so far off from our own era of late decadence, the 21st century. Of course, as in our own time, the placid aestheticism was also unsustainable.</p>\n<p>Genji was written by Murasaki Shikibu, a noblewoman from the powerful Fujiwara family serving in the court of one of the empresses at the time, Empress Shoshi, in Heian-Kyo, now Kyoto. We don&rsquo;t know her real name. Murasaki is adopted from the name of Genji&rsquo;s principal love, thought to be a stand-in for the author, and Shikibu is derived from her father&rsquo;s position. Yet she&rsquo;s one of the most famous authors, especially female authors, of all time.</p>\n<p>Unlike most Heian women, she had a father who made sure she was well-educated; she could read and write Chinese, the language of the government and thus of men. Yet she was an ambivalent participant in court life however closely she managed to observe it. Like many writers, she preferred &ldquo;living all the time in a poetical world of my own scarcely realizing the existence of other people,&rdquo; as she wrote in her diary. The inspiration for Genji legendarily came when Shikibu went on a pilgrimage (a popular mode of entertainment for bored noblewomen) to the Temple of Ishiyama and gazed out at the moon over Lake Biwa. Shikibu&rsquo;s story made her a kind of literary saint; the ink stone supposed to be the one she used in Ishiyama is even on view at the Met like a Christian relic.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://images.newrepublic.com/a8fa21da66da587a3b164716763ff27b5be44014.jpeg?w=800&q=65&dpi=1&fm=pjpg&h=387\"></img><figcaption>&ldquo;The Safflower&rdquo; from the mid-17th century &ldquo;Phantom Genji Scrolls&rdquo;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Throughout the Met exhibition, the author is depicted in large scroll paintings perched above a lap-height desk gazing out into the distance in a timeless depiction of writerly angst, perhaps wondering what Genji would get up to next. Her face is indistinguishable from those of her characters. What marks individuality in the illustrations is the sheer sumptuousness of garments and an apparent lack of mobility&mdash;only the most noble, idealized women are marooned by their dozen layers of robes and long black hair spooling out like ribbon on the floor. Style was also a prison. Looking at a refreshingly spare, monochrome ink-line painting of a late Genji chapter from the 13th century, the women appear as static and integrated into the room as the furniture.</p>\n<p>The dominant mood of Genji is summarized in the Japanese phrase <i>mono-no-aware</i>&mdash;a kind of sigh over the pathos of things in the world, the poignant beauty of total ephemerality as outlined by Buddhist thought. Under the code of <i>mono-no-aware</i>, one must appreciate the cherry blossoms blooming and then falling; the bare branches in winter; and the way the rising moon casts shadows on a nighttime path, the better for a man to make his quiet exit from a woman&rsquo;s room. Artists usually depict the characters in states of calm contemplation or discussion. This habit of consuming experiences as much as things&mdash;observing intricacies of time and space passing by&mdash;is millennial and Instagram-like, an impression heightened by the book&rsquo;s episodic nature. Genji plays koto. He holds a poetry contest. His lover gets murdered by the ghost of his previous lover. His son steals a woman away on a boat. Etc.</p>\n<aside>Men are always cracking wooden shutters, drawing aside curtains, and peeking through fences to catch glimpses of women, as Genji does on a 17th-century folding screen.</aside>\n<p>Or maybe the appeal of Genji art is more like Tinder. You can sweep vicariously through the list of romances and choose which suits or represents you best. (In later centuries, courtesans were known to take the names of Genji&rsquo;s famous love interests as pseudonyms.) At the Met exhibition, the viewer becomes a voyeur of voyeurs, a doubled gaze. Men are always cracking wooden shutters, drawing aside curtains, and peeking through fences to catch glimpses of women, as Genji does on a 17th-century folding screen. The scene is when Genji sees the child Lady Murasaki for the first time and falls immediately in love. The nuns caring for her think it&rsquo;s kind of weird that he wants to adopt her at such an early age to eventually be one of his wives, but they go with it because Genji can ultimately do no wrong.</p>\n<p>Throughout the novel, Shikibu compares her fictional scenes to visual art&mdash;landscapes are described as resembling paintings and gatherings of beautiful people inspire the desire to paint them. Maybe this was a way of grasping for a framework for the form she was inventing as she went along. The novel&rsquo;s cult of potent images, as visually beautiful as any ekphrastic literature, is what makes it so enduring to this day. The exhibition ends with a manga comic version of <i>Genji</i> by Yamato Waki from 1989, a painting with the prince&rsquo;s face floating beatifically above a cloudy horizon. It&rsquo;s an illustration of the&mdash;postmodern? oblique?&mdash;chapter of Genji&rsquo;s death, which Shikibu left blank.</p>\n<p>The Heian court believed they were approaching the end of a Buddhist cycle of history and thus a kind of apocalypse. &ldquo;Everything seems to be in a state of decline,&rdquo; Genji observes at one point. They were right, in a way. The Heian period ended in 1185 as conflicts between relatively Spartan Buddhist warrior-monks escalated in the hills around Kyoto and eventually engulfed the city, leading to a new ruling family in the militaristic Kamakura period, who considered the Heians louche and immoral. It&rsquo;s hard to argue with that, though Shikibu&rsquo;s literature was gradually upheld as reflecting Buddhist values.</p>\n<aside>Dynasties end, people die, seasons pass, the blooms fade&mdash;the only constant is implacable change.</aside>\n<p><i>Mono-no-aware </i>sometimes resembles a vast &ldquo;lol nothing matters.&rdquo; Dynasties end, people die, seasons pass, the blooms fade&mdash;the only constant is implacable change and the best one can do is observe it rather than attempt to halt its pace. Clouds often move through the Genji illustrations, stretches of blank space often painted in lambent gold leaf washing through buildings and obstructing forests. They seem to represent the unceasing flow of time and the ephemerality of human achievement, no matter how civilized.</p>\n<p>This doesn&rsquo;t amount to a coherent political analysis, of course. But reading and looking at <i>Genji</i> today is a lesson in the possibilities of beauty even as the world falls apart. Sure, Genji and his pals were relentless decadents, the .01 percent, first against the wall when the revolution comes. Shikibu only notices peasants enough to describe them as ugly and stupid. But the characters take joy in affixing a handwritten message to a blooming branch, in attending an all-night gossip session around a lit brazier on a porch, and in falling in and out of love. These are nice things to remember, the kind of fleeting sensual experiences that will last as long as flawed humanity. As Shikibu writes of Genji: &ldquo;Despite himself he could not help seeing that that old habit of his, to suffer agonies for impossible desires, was with him still.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "The first thing you need to know about the titular character of The Tale of Genji, the world\u2019s first novel, a thousand pages completed in Heian-period Japan around 1021 CE, is that he is hot AF, as they say on the Internet. Prince Genji, a secondary son of the emperor who is made a commoner so he won\u2019t be threatened at court, is possessed of an astonishing beauty from birth. A traveling physiognomist declares him \u201cdestined to become the father of his people.\u201d His nickname is The Shining Lord. Genji is so hot that men repeatedly wish he was a woman (Heian beauty standards ran androgynous). He excels at literally everything from playing the stringed koto to collecting paintings and writing poetry, not to mention constantly seducing women with his immaculate taste, only to kind of ignore them after installing them in a mansion somewhere.\nIn the Heian period, when Buddhism was first becoming the land\u2019s principal religion, beauty was a moral force: The more beauty in this life, the better karma the person must have had in a previous life to deserve it, and vice versa. The best poem, painting, color-coordinated robe\u2014these were all aesthetically as well as spiritually appealing in a kind of religiously validated, feudalist consumerism. And Prince Genji was the epitome of both.\nIn a dim, sectioned gallery like the chambers of a traditional Japanese house, the Metropolitan Museum has collected a Genji-themed exhibition that\u2019s as glittering and various as the novel itself, featuring illuminated scrolls, engraved book containers, and folding screens all depicting the book\u2019s pivotal scenes. The artwork is the result of centuries of fandom, hand-copying the tale from one generation to the next. Genji\u2019s Heian-ideal face\u2014a round, pallid visage with high, bushy eyebrows and a pouty mouth\u2014shines out from all of them. He was never emperor, but the fictional prince did become the father of his people (as well as some possibly illegitimate children) through art rather than politics. The exhibition presents the novel as a wellspring of culture similar to the Bible and western art, if Jesus had been all about promiscuous sex and choosing which incense to perfume your robes with based on the season.\nRather than life-or-death decisions, the vast majority of the characters\u2019 trials center on quoting an appropriate poem or knowing when to follow up with an absent lover. The Heian conflation of taste, ethics, and identity, not to mention their preoccupation with sending each other poem fragments like so many text messages and then fretting about not getting replies, wasn\u2019t so far off from our own era of late decadence, the 21st century. Of course, as in our own time, the placid aestheticism was also unsustainable.\nGenji was written by Murasaki Shikibu, a noblewoman from the powerful Fujiwara family serving in the court of one of the empresses at the time, Empress Shoshi, in Heian-Kyo, now Kyoto. We don\u2019t know her real name. Murasaki is adopted from the name of Genji\u2019s principal love, thought to be a stand-in for the author, and Shikibu is derived from her father\u2019s position. Yet she\u2019s one of the most famous authors, especially female authors, of all time.\nUnlike most Heian women, she had a father who made sure she was well-educated; she could read and write Chinese, the language of the government and thus of men. Yet she was an ambivalent participant in court life however closely she managed to observe it. Like many writers, she preferred \u201cliving all the time in a poetical world of my own scarcely realizing the existence of other people,\u201d as she wrote in her diary. The inspiration for Genji legendarily came when Shikibu went on a pilgrimage (a popular mode of entertainment for bored noblewomen) to the Temple of Ishiyama and gazed out at the moon over Lake Biwa. Shikibu\u2019s story made her a kind of literary saint; the ink stone supposed to be the one she used in Ishiyama is even on view at the Met like a Christian relic.\nThroughout the Met exhibition, the author is depicted in large scroll paintings perched above a lap-height desk gazing out into the distance in a timeless depiction of writerly angst, perhaps wondering what Genji would get up to next. Her face is indistinguishable from those of her characters. What marks individuality in the illustrations is the sheer sumptuousness of garments and an apparent lack of mobility\u2014only the most noble, idealized women are marooned by their dozen layers of robes and long black hair spooling out like ribbon on the floor. Style was also a prison. Looking at a refreshingly spare, monochrome ink-line painting of a late Genji chapter from the 13th century, the women appear as static and integrated into the room as the furniture.\nThe dominant mood of Genji is summarized in the Japanese phrase mono-no-aware\u2014a kind of sigh over the pathos of things in the world, the poignant beauty of total ephemerality as outlined by Buddhist thought. Under the code of mono-no-aware, one must appreciate the cherry blossoms blooming and then falling; the bare branches in winter; and the way the rising moon casts shadows on a nighttime path, the better for a man to make his quiet exit from a woman\u2019s room. Artists usually depict the characters in states of calm contemplation or discussion. This habit of consuming experiences as much as things\u2014observing intricacies of time and space passing by\u2014is millennial and Instagram-like, an impression heightened by the book\u2019s episodic nature. Genji plays koto. He holds a poetry contest. His lover gets murdered by the ghost of his previous lover. His son steals a woman away on a boat. Etc.\nMen are always cracking wooden shutters, drawing aside curtains, and peeking through fences to catch glimpses of women, as Genji does on a 17th-century folding screen.\nOr maybe the appeal of Genji art is more like Tinder. You can sweep vicariously through the list of romances and choose which suits or represents you best. (In later centuries, courtesans were known to take the names of Genji\u2019s famous love interests as pseudonyms.) At the Met exhibition, the viewer becomes a voyeur of voyeurs, a doubled gaze. Men are always cracking wooden shutters, drawing aside curtains, and peeking through fences to catch glimpses of women, as Genji does on a 17th-century folding screen. The scene is when Genji sees the child Lady Murasaki for the first time and falls immediately in love. The nuns caring for her think it\u2019s kind of weird that he wants to adopt her at such an early age to eventually be one of his wives, but they go with it because Genji can ultimately do no wrong.\nThroughout the novel, Shikibu compares her fictional scenes to visual art\u2014landscapes are described as resembling paintings and gatherings of beautiful people inspire the desire to paint them. Maybe this was a way of grasping for a framework for the form she was inventing as she went along. The novel\u2019s cult of potent images, as visually beautiful as any ekphrastic literature, is what makes it so enduring to this day. The exhibition ends with a manga comic version of Genji by Yamato Waki from 1989, a painting with the prince\u2019s face floating beatifically above a cloudy horizon. It\u2019s an illustration of the\u2014postmodern? oblique?\u2014chapter of Genji\u2019s death, which Shikibu left blank.\nThe Heian court believed they were approaching the end of a Buddhist cycle of history and thus a kind of apocalypse. \u201cEverything seems to be in a state of decline,\u201d Genji observes at one point. They were right, in a way. The Heian period ended in 1185 as conflicts between relatively Spartan Buddhist warrior-monks escalated in the hills around Kyoto and eventually engulfed the city, leading to a new ruling family in the militaristic Kamakura period, who considered the Heians louche and immoral. It\u2019s hard to argue with that, though Shikibu\u2019s literature was gradually upheld as reflecting Buddhist values.\nDynasties end, people die, seasons pass, the blooms fade\u2014the only constant is implacable change.\nMono-no-aware sometimes resembles a vast \u201clol nothing matters.\u201d Dynasties end, people die, seasons pass, the blooms fade\u2014the only constant is implacable change and the best one can do is observe it rather than attempt to halt its pace. Clouds often move through the Genji illustrations, stretches of blank space often painted in lambent gold leaf washing through buildings and obstructing forests. They seem to represent the unceasing flow of time and the ephemerality of human achievement, no matter how civilized.\nThis doesn\u2019t amount to a coherent political analysis, of course. But reading and looking at Genji today is a lesson in the possibilities of beauty even as the world falls apart. Sure, Genji and his pals were relentless decadents, the .01 percent, first against the wall when the revolution comes. Shikibu only notices peasants enough to describe them as ugly and stupid. But the characters take joy in affixing a handwritten message to a blooming branch, in attending an all-night gossip session around a lit brazier on a porch, and in falling in and out of love. These are nice things to remember, the kind of fleeting sensual experiences that will last as long as flawed humanity. As Shikibu writes of Genji: \u201cDespite himself he could not help seeing that that old habit of his, to suffer agonies for impossible desires, was with him still.\u201d",

Our clicks give us the information and products we ask for, but at the same time they provide information about us. Algorithms then make use of that data to curate our search results, our social media feeds, and the advertisements we see. The internet ascribes an identity to its users, and projects it back to us.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/health/facebook-likes-psychographics/index.html\">research</a> behind the political campaigns run by Cambridge Analytica in 2016 suggested that a few Facebook likes are enough for an algorithm to identify our gender, personality traits, sexual orientation, religious and political beliefs. &ldquo;Computer-based personality judgments,&rdquo; two psychologists and a computer scientist claimed in a research paper in 2015, can &ldquo;be more accurate than those made by humans.&rdquo; The algorithms can end up knowing us better than our spouses do. If that&rsquo;s true&mdash;not all researchers think it is&mdash;what does that mean for our own understanding of who we are?</p>\n<p>The question is particularly relevant in the wake of Facebook&rsquo;s April 1 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47771922\">announcement</a> that it will soon boost &ldquo;algorithmic transparency&rdquo; for users with a &ldquo;Why am I seeing this post?&rdquo; button&mdash;an update of a feature that already exists for ads, and a new feature for all other posts on a person&rsquo;s timeline. Most of us have little understanding of how the algorithms in charge of our internet experience work, and have no control over them other than the information we provide, many times involuntarily. The button would be one of a few small windows into how the internet decides what to show us: Amazon&rsquo;s book recommendations, for example, are supposedly based on the purchases of people who ordered the same books as us. Netflix says its personalized recommendations are based on what we&rsquo;ve already watched: &ldquo;The more you watch, the better Netflix gets at recommending TV shows and movies you&rsquo;ll love,&rdquo; the company claims. Facebook&rsquo;s new feature promises to uncover part of the identity that Facebook&rsquo;s algorithms have assigned us, essentially letting us in on the personality quiz we unwittingly participate in each day&mdash;a good thing, right?</p>\n<p>People tend to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/3/16035100/personality-quizzes-fake-hogwarts-meyers-briggs-mbti-astrology-zodiac\">love</a> taking online personality quizzes. &ldquo;Personality tests offer a structured way of self-reflection. They&rsquo;re a little bit like therapy in that way,&rdquo; says <a href=\"https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/svazire\">Simine Vazire</a>, Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Davis. And while the tests are all based on self-reporting, &ldquo;self-reporting is actually quite reliable&rdquo; Vazire adds. (She is skeptical about the accuracy of algorithms judging personality solely from online behavior, on the other hand.)</p>\n<p>But personality quizzes can not only reveal, but also shape a personality. In 2002, a Japanese <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1467-839X.00057?r3_referer=wol\">study</a> found that even when subjects took what were&mdash;unbeknownst to them&mdash;bogus pop psychology tests, and were then told they exhibited a particular personality trait (extroversion, for example) they tended to believe the result and proceeded to act in ways that matched that description. &ldquo;While the feedback is originally inaccurate,&rdquo; the researchers wrote, &ldquo;it could change the self-image of people who receive the feedback, and may eventually be perceived as an accurate description of their personality or psychological state.&rdquo; Believing the tests seemed to lead people to internalize them.</p>\n<p>So what does that mean for Facebook algorithms? The general idea that social media can affect our psychology is familiar at this point: Seeing other people&rsquo;s perfectly curated lives on Instagram or a series of others&rsquo; achievements on Facebook can dent our self-esteem. And some feel different platforms have a tendency to accentuate certain <a href=\"https://www.1843magazine.com/technology/be-your-selves\">personality</a> traits: Twitter reveals the adversarial part in many of its users, Instagram encourages vanity.</p>\n<aside>&ldquo;Participants evaluated themselves as more sophisticated after receiving an ad [for a high-end watch brand] that they thought was individually targeted to them.&rdquo;</aside>\n<p>Ad-targeting algorithms, it turns out, can function very similarly to personality quizzes, right down to affecting our sense of self. In 2016, three researchers tested the effect and <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/43/1/156/2379732?redirectedFrom=PDF\">published</a> the results in the <i>Journal of Consumer Research</i>. &ldquo;The data show that participants evaluated themselves as more sophisticated after receiving an ad [for a high-end watch brand] that they thought was individually targeted to them, compared to when they thought the same ad was not targeted,&rdquo; they <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/targeted-ads-dont-just-make-you-more-likely-to-buy-they-can-change-how-you-think-about-yourself\">wrote</a>. &ldquo;In other words, participants saw the targeted ads as reflective of their own characteristics.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That, in turn, alters behavior&mdash;and not just upping the probability that individuals purchase the advertised product, as the advertisers want. Participants in another experiment the researchers ran, who were shown ads for an environmentally friendly product they thought was targeted at them, were not only more likely to buy the product, but also more likely to donate to an environmental charity soon after. Again, it didn&rsquo;t matter whether the targeted ads were actually based on participants&rsquo; past behavior&mdash;just that participants <i>believed </i>they were.</p>\n<p>According to these findings, then, the actual effect of Facebook&rsquo;s &ldquo;Why am I seeing this?&rdquo; button could be rather unnerving: a placating show of transparency that only enhances the hold the behemoth has on our minds. The glimpse into who Facebook thinks we are could affect how we see ourselves.</p>\n<p>The idea that personhood is something fragile, dependent on others for confirmation and reinforcement, goes back to at least the nineteenth century. German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel saw identity as something formed through social relationships of recognition with others who we invest with the authority to grant us that identity. Many features of our personality exhibit that social dependency: One cannot continue to think oneself particularly gregarious, for example, when everyone else claims otherwise.</p>\n<p>It is this recognition of one&rsquo;s identity by someone else that people look for in personality tests. Being couched in the language of psychology gives them the necessary authority.</p>\n<p>Similarly, and crucially, it&rsquo;s our <i>belief</i> that the algorithms know us that makes us susceptible to them. And therein lies one way out of the trap: Seeing why Facebook thinks a particular post is relevant to us could also make it easier to dismiss it, just as it&rsquo;s easy to dismiss Amazon recommendations based on purchases we regret.</p>\n<p>A degree of skepticism might be the best way to avoid ceding control over our identities. Ultimately, we need to remind ourselves that the platforms analyzing our online behavior are only interested in aspects of ourselves that they can monetize. We should treat their depictions of us with the same wariness and suspicion we&rsquo;d offer any human salesperson aiming to manipulate us.</p>",

                "text": "When we go online these days, we know we\u2019re not alone: The internet is looking back at us. Our clicks give us the information and products we ask for, but at the same time they provide information about us. Algorithms then make use of that data to curate our search results, our social media feeds, and the advertisements we see. The internet ascribes an identity to its users, and projects it back to us.\nThe research behind the political campaigns run by Cambridge Analytica in 2016 suggested that a few Facebook likes are enough for an algorithm to identify our gender, personality traits, sexual orientation, religious and political beliefs. \u201cComputer-based personality judgments,\u201d two psychologists and a computer scientist claimed in a research paper in 2015, can \u201cbe more accurate than those made by humans.\u201d The algorithms can end up knowing us better than our spouses do. If that\u2019s true\u2014not all researchers think it is\u2014what does that mean for our own understanding of who we are?\nThe question is particularly relevant in the wake of Facebook\u2019s April 1 announcement that it will soon boost \u201calgorithmic transparency\u201d for users with a \u201cWhy am I seeing this post?\u201d button\u2014an update of a feature that already exists for ads, and a new feature for all other posts on a person\u2019s timeline. Most of us have little understanding of how the algorithms in charge of our internet experience work, and have no control over them other than the information we provide, many times involuntarily. The button would be one of a few small windows into how the internet decides what to show us: Amazon\u2019s book recommendations, for example, are supposedly based on the purchases of people who ordered the same books as us. Netflix says its personalized recommendations are based on what we\u2019ve already watched: \u201cThe more you watch, the better Netflix gets at recommending TV shows and movies you\u2019ll love,\u201d the company claims. Facebook\u2019s new feature promises to uncover part of the identity that Facebook\u2019s algorithms have assigned us, essentially letting us in on the personality quiz we unwittingly participate in each day\u2014a good thing, right?\nPeople tend to love taking online personality quizzes. \u201cPersonality tests offer a structured way of self-reflection. They\u2019re a little bit like therapy in that way,\u201d says Simine Vazire, Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Davis. And while the tests are all based on self-reporting, \u201cself-reporting is actually quite reliable\u201d Vazire adds. (She is skeptical about the accuracy of algorithms judging personality solely from online behavior, on the other hand.)\nBut personality quizzes can not only reveal, but also shape a personality. In 2002, a Japanese study found that even when subjects took what were\u2014unbeknownst to them\u2014bogus pop psychology tests, and were then told they exhibited a particular personality trait (extroversion, for example) they tended to believe the result and proceeded to act in ways that matched that description. \u201cWhile the feedback is originally inaccurate,\u201d the researchers wrote, \u201cit could change the self-image of people who receive the feedback, and may eventually be perceived as an accurate description of their personality or psychological state.\u201d Believing the tests seemed to lead people to internalize them.\nSo what does that mean for Facebook algorithms? The general idea that social media can affect our psychology is familiar at this point: Seeing other people\u2019s perfectly curated lives on Instagram or a series of others\u2019 achievements on Facebook can dent our self-esteem. And some feel different platforms have a tendency to accentuate certain personality traits: Twitter reveals the adversarial part in many of its users, Instagram encourages vanity.\n\u201cParticipants evaluated themselves as more sophisticated after receiving an ad [for a high-end watch brand] that they thought was individually targeted to them.\u201d\nAd-targeting algorithms, it turns out, can function very similarly to personality quizzes, right down to affecting our sense of self. In 2016, three researchers tested the effect and published the results in the Journal of Consumer Research. \u201cThe data show that participants evaluated themselves as more sophisticated after receiving an ad [for a high-end watch brand] that they thought was individually targeted to them, compared to when they thought the same ad was not targeted,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIn other words, participants saw the targeted ads as reflective of their own characteristics.\u201d\nThat, in turn, alters behavior\u2014and not just upping the probability that individuals purchase the advertised product, as the advertisers want. Participants in another experiment the researchers ran, who were shown ads for an environmentally friendly product they thought was targeted at them, were not only more likely to buy the product, but also more likely to donate to an environmental charity soon after. Again, it didn\u2019t matter whether the targeted ads were actually based on participants\u2019 past behavior\u2014just that participants believed they were.\nAccording to these findings, then, the actual effect of Facebook\u2019s \u201cWhy am I seeing this?\u201d button could be rather unnerving: a placating show of transparency that only enhances the hold the behemoth has on our minds. The glimpse into who Facebook thinks we are could affect how we see ourselves.\nThe idea that personhood is something fragile, dependent on others for confirmation and reinforcement, goes back to at least the nineteenth century. German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel saw identity as something formed through social relationships of recognition with others who we invest with the authority to grant us that identity. Many features of our personality exhibit that social dependency: One cannot continue to think oneself particularly gregarious, for example, when everyone else claims otherwise.\nIt is this recognition of one\u2019s identity by someone else that people look for in personality tests. Being couched in the language of psychology gives them the necessary authority.\nSimilarly, and crucially, it\u2019s our belief that the algorithms know us that makes us susceptible to them. And therein lies one way out of the trap: Seeing why Facebook thinks a particular post is relevant to us could also make it easier to dismiss it, just as it\u2019s easy to dismiss Amazon recommendations based on purchases we regret.\nA degree of skepticism might be the best way to avoid ceding control over our identities. Ultimately, we need to remind ourselves that the platforms analyzing our online behavior are only interested in aspects of ourselves that they can monetize. We should treat their depictions of us with the same wariness and suspicion we\u2019d offer any human salesperson aiming to manipulate us.",

When it burns down the spire of Notre Dame&mdash;one of Christendom&rsquo;s great churches, resting at the heart of the French nation&mdash;the emotional effect can be tremendous.</p>\n<p>Parisians and the world watched in horror on Monday as flames devoured much of the ancient cathedral, though it spared its iconic twin bell towers and most of the external stone structure. The cause appears to be accidental, according to Paris officials. The cathedral&rsquo;s upper levels were built in the twelfth and thirteenth century with a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/nortre-dame-fire-oak-wood-trnd/index.html\">forest</a>&rdquo; of ancient oak trees, which became the kindling for Monday&rsquo;s conflagration. Scaffolding and construction equipment on the roof may have provided the spark to ignite it. This mundane hypothesis doesn&rsquo;t detract from the shock of watching an eight-century-old cultural landmark go up in flames.</p>\n<p>Into that psychic void rushed numerous observers and commentators who sought to find a more profound meaning from the blaze, notably by tying it to the social unrest and political discord in France today. It&rsquo;s human to try to find sweeping answers to seemingly random events. In their search for deeper truths, however, these analysts may have missed a conclusion that is more superficial&mdash;yet more significant.</p>\n<p>President Emmanuel Macron has spent the last few months struggling to address the Yellow Vest movement, which has led waves of protests and riots against his unpopular economic policies. He had planned to deliver an address to the French people on Monday night to outline his latest response to the turmoil, but as news of the fire broke, he canceled those plans and rushed to the scene, vowing to rebuild the ancient cathedral. The fire &ldquo;seemed to underscore the challenges heaped before his administration, which has struggled to reconcile the formidable weight of France&rsquo;s ideals and storied past with the necessity for change to meet the demands of the 21st century,&rdquo; <i>The New York Times</i> reported in its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/world/europe/notre-dame-fire.html\">main story on the blaze</a>.</p>\n<p>Michael Kimmelman, the <i>Times</i>&rsquo; architecture critic, also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/world/europe/notre-dame-france-fire.html\">saw parallels</a> between the mass sorrow over the cathedral&rsquo;s fate and public outrage over Macron&rsquo;s reforms. &ldquo;Generations that had come to rely on this social safety net, as a matter of national pride and identity, see it going up in smoke,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;On Monday, so was the cathedral, which for centuries has enshrined an evolving notion of Frenchness. The symbolism was hard to miss.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Others perceived an even deeper malaise. In <i>The Guardian</i>, Gilles Gressani and Math&eacute;o Malik <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/16/notre-dame-warning-europe-value-cathedral-flames\">argued</a> that the &ldquo;catastrophe of Notre Dame represents so perfectly the condition of contemporary Europeans: people condemned to live among wonders, taking them for granted, ignorant of the fact that they may disappear&mdash;then suddenly finding themselves in a situation they&rsquo;d never envisioned.&rdquo; <i>National Review</i>&rsquo;s Rich Lowry <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-distressing-message/\">wrote</a> that the cathedral &ldquo;stands for so many qualities that we now lack&mdash;patience and staying power, the cultivation of beauty, a deep religious faith, a cultural confidence and ambition that could create a timeless monument of our civilization.&rdquo; <i>The Moscow Times </i><a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/04/16/notre-dame-fire-symbolizes-europes-decline-russian-commentators-say-a65246\">quoted</a> Russian commentators who saw the fire as an allegory for European decline.</p>\n<p>A great blaze can serve as a blank slate onto which people project their social and cultural anxieties. When Rome burned in 63 A.D., imperial officials responded by persecuting the early Christians for abandoning the city&rsquo;s polytheistic faith. Londoners <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/great-fire-london-was-blamed-religious-terrorism-180960332/\">blamed the great fire</a> that gutted most of the English capital in 1666 on the Dutch, with whom they were at war, as well as supposed Catholic agents sent by France and Spain to destroy the Protestant metropolis. For centuries, Chinese philosophers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/world/asia/16rumors.html\">viewed natural disasters</a> as a sign that the ruling dynasty may have lost its divine mandate to govern. Elizabeth II&rsquo;s &ldquo;annus horribilis,&rdquo; 1992, was marked by a destructive fire at Windsor Castle (as well as the personal scandals of her children).</p>\n<p>The queen&rsquo;s experience may be the most relevant. If there&rsquo;s a takeaway from Notre Dame&rsquo;s partial destruction, it&rsquo;s profoundly simple: This was the inevitable result of neglect. The French state owns most of the country&rsquo;s cultural patrimony, including Notre Dame and other major cathedrals. Government officials allocated $2.28 million per year for its maintenance and upkeep, including a small boost in recent years to restore the central spire. This was barely enough to keep the cathedral open and presentable to tourists, let alone the wholesale restoration and modernization that it desperately needed.</p>\n<p>In 2017, <i>Time</i> magazine published an in-depth exploration of Notre Dame&rsquo;s crumbling stonework, which had made parts of the structure almost too dangerous for people to enter. It also captured the lack of energy among civil servants to address the cathedral&rsquo;s problems. &ldquo;France has thousands of monuments,&rdquo; the magazine <a href=\"http://time.com/4876087/notre-dame-cathedral-is-crumbling/\">quoted an unnamed official</a> at the French Ministry of Culture as saying, suggesting that the cathedral was not a high priority. &ldquo;It will not fall down,&rdquo; she told the magazine. In a way, she was right. It burned instead.</p>\n<p>Every country has its treasured landmarks that are expensive to maintain and even more costly to modernize. Britain&rsquo;s Palace of Westminster, which houses the country&rsquo;s Parliament, is among the most urgent cases. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/01/a-tale-of-decay-the-houses-of-parliament-are-falling-down\">2017 investigation by <i>The Guardian</i></a> found that the baroque former palace is a dangerous tangle of Victorian steam pipes and twentieth-century wiring, and that Parliament was sluggish to address the problem. After decades of delays, lawmakers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/16/uk-parliament-could-suffer-same-fate-as-notre-dame-warn-mps\">finally agreed to vacate</a> the building in the mid-2020s for a multi-billion-dollar renovation program.</p>\n<p>If Westminster burns down before then, it will be because the British government failed to save it in time&mdash;a victim of the country&rsquo;s political ossification. And if there is a lesson to be taken from Notre Dame&rsquo;s fate for everyone else, it isn&rsquo;t about the trajectory of European civilization or the upheavals of the French nation. It&rsquo;s that humanity&rsquo;s cultural heritage won&rsquo;t save itself.</p>",

                "text": "Fire has held a certain mystical power in the human mind since Prometheus stole it from the gods. When it burns down the spire of Notre Dame\u2014one of Christendom\u2019s great churches, resting at the heart of the French nation\u2014the emotional effect can be tremendous.\nParisians and the world watched in horror on Monday as flames devoured much of the ancient cathedral, though it spared its iconic twin bell towers and most of the external stone structure. The cause appears to be accidental, according to Paris officials. The cathedral\u2019s upper levels were built in the twelfth and thirteenth century with a \u201cforest\u201d of ancient oak trees, which became the kindling for Monday\u2019s conflagration. Scaffolding and construction equipment on the roof may have provided the spark to ignite it. This mundane hypothesis doesn\u2019t detract from the shock of watching an eight-century-old cultural landmark go up in flames.\nInto that psychic void rushed numerous observers and commentators who sought to find a more profound meaning from the blaze, notably by tying it to the social unrest and political discord in France today. It\u2019s human to try to find sweeping answers to seemingly random events. In their search for deeper truths, however, these analysts may have missed a conclusion that is more superficial\u2014yet more significant.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron has spent the last few months struggling to address the Yellow Vest movement, which has led waves of protests and riots against his unpopular economic policies. He had planned to deliver an address to the French people on Monday night to outline his latest response to the turmoil, but as news of the fire broke, he canceled those plans and rushed to the scene, vowing to rebuild the ancient cathedral. The fire \u201cseemed to underscore the challenges heaped before his administration, which has struggled to reconcile the formidable weight of France\u2019s ideals and storied past with the necessity for change to meet the demands of the 21st century,\u201d The New York Times reported in its main story on the blaze.\nMichael Kimmelman, the Times\u2019 architecture critic, also saw parallels between the mass sorrow over the cathedral\u2019s fate and public outrage over Macron\u2019s reforms. \u201cGenerations that had come to rely on this social safety net, as a matter of national pride and identity, see it going up in smoke,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOn Monday, so was the cathedral, which for centuries has enshrined an evolving notion of Frenchness. The symbolism was hard to miss.\u201d\nOthers perceived an even deeper malaise. In The Guardian, Gilles Gressani and Math\u00e9o Malik argued that the \u201ccatastrophe of Notre Dame represents so perfectly the condition of contemporary Europeans: people condemned to live among wonders, taking them for granted, ignorant of the fact that they may disappear\u2014then suddenly finding themselves in a situation they\u2019d never envisioned.\u201d National Review\u2019s Rich Lowry wrote that the cathedral \u201cstands for so many qualities that we now lack\u2014patience and staying power, the cultivation of beauty, a deep religious faith, a cultural confidence and ambition that could create a timeless monument of our civilization.\u201d The Moscow Times quoted Russian commentators who saw the fire as an allegory for European decline.\nA great blaze can serve as a blank slate onto which people project their social and cultural anxieties. When Rome burned in 63 A.D., imperial officials responded by persecuting the early Christians for abandoning the city\u2019s polytheistic faith. Londoners blamed the great fire that gutted most of the English capital in 1666 on the Dutch, with whom they were at war, as well as supposed Catholic agents sent by France and Spain to destroy the Protestant metropolis. For centuries, Chinese philosophers viewed natural disasters as a sign that the ruling dynasty may have lost its divine mandate to govern. Elizabeth II\u2019s \u201cannus horribilis,\u201d 1992, was marked by a destructive fire at Windsor Castle (as well as the personal scandals of her children).\nThe queen\u2019s experience may be the most relevant. If there\u2019s a takeaway from Notre Dame\u2019s partial destruction, it\u2019s profoundly simple: This was the inevitable result of neglect. The French state owns most of the country\u2019s cultural patrimony, including Notre Dame and other major cathedrals. Government officials allocated $2.28 million per year for its maintenance and upkeep, including a small boost in recent years to restore the central spire. This was barely enough to keep the cathedral open and presentable to tourists, let alone the wholesale restoration and modernization that it desperately needed.\nIn 2017, Time magazine published an in-depth exploration of Notre Dame\u2019s crumbling stonework, which had made parts of the structure almost too dangerous for people to enter. It also captured the lack of energy among civil servants to address the cathedral\u2019s problems. \u201cFrance has thousands of monuments,\u201d the magazine quoted an unnamed official at the French Ministry of Culture as saying, suggesting that the cathedral was not a high priority. \u201cIt will not fall down,\u201d she told the magazine. In a way, she was right. It burned instead.\nEvery country has its treasured landmarks that are expensive to maintain and even more costly to modernize. Britain\u2019s Palace of Westminster, which houses the country\u2019s Parliament, is among the most urgent cases. A 2017 investigation by The Guardian found that the baroque former palace is a dangerous tangle of Victorian steam pipes and twentieth-century wiring, and that Parliament was sluggish to address the problem. After decades of delays, lawmakers have finally agreed to vacate the building in the mid-2020s for a multi-billion-dollar renovation program.\nIf Westminster burns down before then, it will be because the British government failed to save it in time\u2014a victim of the country\u2019s political ossification. And if there is a lesson to be taken from Notre Dame\u2019s fate for everyone else, it isn\u2019t about the trajectory of European civilization or the upheavals of the French nation. It\u2019s that humanity\u2019s cultural heritage won\u2019t save itself.",

But what I don&rsquo;t want to do Is take people&rsquo;s time, effort and commitment without there being a clear shot I could be the nominee. I think I can. I think that&rsquo;s where we are,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re also taking a hard look at whether or not this alleged appeal I have &mdash; how deep does it run? Is it real?&rdquo; Biden continued.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still a couple hurdles to make sure this is all in place. But I&rsquo;m not there yet. I don&rsquo;t want to mislead you. I have not made the final decision.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The loquacious Delaware pol also said that Trump&rsquo;s reaction to the racial violence in Charlottesville, Va., prompted both him and former President Obama to speak out about the president&rsquo;s equivocation sooner than they had planned.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Barack and I agreed we were not going to comment on President Trump&rsquo;s administration for a year to give him a chance to get set up. We thought we&rsquo;d do what [President George] W [Bush] did with us.

Ted Kennedy, William Fulbright and Jennings Randolph in the Senate gym, where &ldquo;everybody walks around in their birthday suit.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The first time I met these guys, I saw all of them,&rdquo; he said.</p>",

But what I don\u2019t want to do Is take people\u2019s time, effort and commitment without there being a clear shot I could be the nominee. I think I can. I think that\u2019s where we are,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re also taking a hard look at whether or not this alleged appeal I have \u2014 how deep does it run? Is it real?\u201d Biden continued.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a couple hurdles to make sure this is all in place. But I\u2019m not there yet. I don\u2019t want to mislead you. I have not made the final decision.\u201d\nThe loquacious Delaware pol also said that Trump\u2019s reaction to the racial violence in Charlottesville, Va., prompted both him and former President Obama to speak out about the president\u2019s equivocation sooner than they had planned.\n\u201cBarack and I agreed we were not going to comment on President Trump\u2019s administration for a year to give him a chance to get set up. We thought we\u2019d do what [President George] W [Bush] did with us. But when Charlottesville happened, I couldn\u2019t remain silent any longer,\u201d he said.\nAnd the longtime former senator fondly recalled days before partisan acrimony poisoned the upper chamber.\nHe said that when he first arrived in Senate he didn\u2019t know many people, but he met Sens. Ted Kennedy, William Fulbright and Jennings Randolph in the Senate gym, where \u201ceverybody walks around in their birthday suit.\u201d\n\u201cThe first time I met these guys, I saw all of them,\u201d he said.",

You\u2019re not wanted here, you\u2019re going to die,\u2019\u201d said Harris, 46. \u201cThey said something about [how] the world is supposed to be coming to an end in February of 2019.\u201d\nThe mother-daughter pair were found Monday afternoon sitting in a bed in their ramshackle home surrounded by the bodies of two of Shana\u2019s children, Naa\u2019Irah Smith, 25, and Damon Decree Jr., 13; Shana\u2019s sister, Jamilla Campbell, 42; and Jamilla\u2019s twin 9-year-old daughters, Imani and Erika Allen, authorities said.\nNo illegal drugs were found in the home, although there was prescription medication, police told The Post. Shana suffered from lupus, they said.\nHarris, who lives in the same housing complex \u2014 about 30 miles north of Philadelphia \u2014 where cops found Shana, 45, and Dominique, 19, surrounded by the bodies, said she thought the family was under the alleged murderous matriarch\u2019s sway.\n\u201cI think the whole family was brainwashed by the mother, Shana,\u201d said Harris, who added that she thought the nightmare was a botched murder-suicide. \u201cI\u2019m thinking [Shana and Dominique] were waiting to die, also. They were all supposed to go, but it just didn\u2019t go according to plan.\u201d\nShana and Dominique have each been charged with five counts of homicide and one count of conspiracy.\nThey have offered wildly divergent and often contradictory accounts of what happened, with Shana at one point telling cops that the victims \u201cwanted to die,\u201d according to court papers.",

His girlfriend attempted to counteract his overdose with Narcan, the Baltimore Sun reported.\nShe called 911 after 3 a.m. Paramedics attempted CPR on Banks but were unable to revive him.\nPolice are still investigating the incident.\nBanks was assigned to the juvenile booking unit but was suspended at the time of his death, according to WBAL. The Baltimore Police Department wouldn\u2019t disclose the reason for his suspension.\nCity Councilman Brandon Scott said Banks\u2019 death represents the need to pay more attention to the issue of drug use and overdoses.\n\u201cNo one is far away from it. It\u2019s at everyone\u2019s doorstep, and it will continue to be that way until we get serious,\u201d Scott said.",

In a stable climate, the numbers should be roughly equal.</p>\n<p>Since 1999, the ratio has been two warm records set or broken for every cold one. In 16 of the last 20 years, there have been more daily high-temperature records than low.</p>\n<p>The AP shared the data analysis with several climate and data scientists, who all said the conclusion was correct, consistent with scientific peer-reviewed literature and showed a clear sign of human-caused climate change. They pointed out that trends over decades are more robust than over single years.</p>\n<p>The analysis stopped with data through 2018. However, the first two months of 2019 are showing twice as many cold records than hot ones. That&rsquo;s temporary and trends are over years and decades, not months, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are in a period of sustained and significant warming and &mdash; over the long run &mdash; will continue to explore and break the warm end of the spectrum much more than the cold end,&rdquo; Arndt said.</p>\n<p>Former Weather Channel meteorologist Guy Walton, who has been studying hot and cold extreme records since 2000, said the trend is unmistakable.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You are getting more extremes,&rdquo; Walton said. &ldquo;Your chances for getting more dangerous extremes are going up with time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>No place has that been more noticeable than the southern California city of Pasadena, where 7,203 days went by between cold records being broken. On Feb. 23, Pasadena set a low-temperature record, its first since June 5, 1999.</p>\n<p>Vermont native Paul Wennberg felt it. He moved to Pasadena in 1998 just before the dearth of cold records.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Even with the local cold we had this past month, it&rsquo;s very noticeable,&rdquo; said Wennberg, a California Institute of Technology atmospheric sciences professor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just been ever warmer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In between the two cold record days, Pasadena set 145 hot records. That includes an all-time high of 113 degrees last year.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Last year was unbelievable here,&rdquo; Wennberg said. &ldquo;The tops of a lot of the hedges, they essentially melted.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Scientists often talked about human-caused global warming in terms of average temperatures, but that&rsquo;s not what costs money or sends people to the hospital. A study this month found that in just 22 states, about 36,000 people on average go to the hospital because of excessive summertime heat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The extremes affect our lives,&rdquo; Arndt said, adding that they are expensive, with hospital stays, rising energy bills and crop losses.</p>\n<p>National Center for Atmospheric Research climate scientist Gerald Meehl, who has published peer-reviewed <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2009GL040736\">papers</a> on the rising hot-to-cold ratio, said people pay more attention to climate when records are broken.</p>\n<p>The AP counted daily records across 424 stations starting in 1920 and ending in 2018. The AP only considered daily &mdash; not all-time &mdash; high maximum temperatures and low minimum temperatures and only used stations with minimal missing data. Temperatures that tied previous records were counted in addition to temperatures that broke previous records.</p>\n<p>More typical than Pasadena is Wooster, Ohio. From 1999 on, Wooster saw 106 high-temperature records set or broken and 51 cold ones. In the previous eight decades, the ratio was slightly colder than one to one.</p>\n<p>At MW Robinson Co., people are lining up for air conditioning installation as the climate seems to get have been getting hotter over the years, said Lori Bowersock, who coordinates the firm&rsquo;s HVAC installations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more and more every year,&rdquo; Bowersock said. &ldquo;Usually we don&rsquo;t have them lined up like this.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>The AP&rsquo;s other findings:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li>Since Jan. 1, 1999, just under half the stations had at least twice as many hot records set than cold ones, including Wooster.</li> <li>In all, 87 percent of the weather stations had more hot records than cold since 1999. There have been 42 weather stations that have at least five hot records for every cold one since 1999, with 11 where the hot-to-cold ratio is 10-to-1 or higher, including Pasadena.</li> <li>All nine of NOAA&rsquo;s climate regions have seen more hot records set than cold ones since 1999, with the West, Southwest and Northeast having a 3-to-1 ratio.</li> <li>All four seasons have had more hot records broken than cold for the same time period.</li> <li>Most decades in the 20th century had close to an even ratio of hot to cold. The 1930s, driven by Dust Bowl summers, had about 1.4 hot records for every cold. The 1960s and 1970s had about 1.5 cold records for every hot. The 21st century has a 1.9-to-1 hot-to-cold ratio.</li> </ul>\n<p>&ldquo;As a measure of climate change, the dailies (temperature records) will tell you more about what&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; said climate scientist Chris Field of Stanford. &ldquo;The impacts of climate change almost always come packaged in extremes.&rdquo;</p>",

That includes an all-time high of 113 degrees last year.\n\u201cLast year was unbelievable here,\u201d Wennberg said. \u201cThe tops of a lot of the hedges, they essentially melted.\u201d\nScientists often talked about human-caused global warming in terms of average temperatures, but that\u2019s not what costs money or sends people to the hospital. A study this month found that in just 22 states, about 36,000 people on average go to the hospital because of excessive summertime heat.\n\u201cThe extremes affect our lives,\u201d Arndt said, adding that they are expensive, with hospital stays, rising energy bills and crop losses.\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research climate scientist Gerald Meehl, who has published peer-reviewed papers on the rising hot-to-cold ratio, said people pay more attention to climate when records are broken.\nThe AP counted daily records across 424 stations starting in 1920 and ending in 2018. The AP only considered daily \u2014 not all-time \u2014 high maximum temperatures and low minimum temperatures and only used stations with minimal missing data. Temperatures that tied previous records were counted in addition to temperatures that broke previous records.\nMore typical than Pasadena is Wooster, Ohio. From 1999 on, Wooster saw 106 high-temperature records set or broken and 51 cold ones. In the previous eight decades, the ratio was slightly colder than one to one.\nAt MW Robinson Co., people are lining up for air conditioning installation as the climate seems to get have been getting hotter over the years, said Lori Bowersock, who coordinates the firm\u2019s HVAC installations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more and more every year,\u201d Bowersock said. \u201cUsually we don\u2019t have them lined up like this.\u201d\nThe AP\u2019s other findings:\nSince Jan. 1, 1999, just under half the stations had at least twice as many hot records set than cold ones, including Wooster.\nIn all, 87 percent of the weather stations had more hot records than cold since 1999. There have been 42 weather stations that have at least five hot records for every cold one since 1999, with 11 where the hot-to-cold ratio is 10-to-1 or higher, including Pasadena.\nAll nine of NOAA\u2019s climate regions have seen more hot records set than cold ones since 1999, with the West, Southwest and Northeast having a 3-to-1 ratio.\nAll four seasons have had more hot records broken than cold for the same time period.\nMost decades in the 20th century had close to an even ratio of hot to cold. The 1930s, driven by Dust Bowl summers, had about 1.4 hot records for every cold. The 1960s and 1970s had about 1.5 cold records for every hot. The 21st century has a 1.9-to-1 hot-to-cold ratio.\n\u201cAs a measure of climate change, the dailies (temperature records) will tell you more about what\u2019s happening,\u201d said climate scientist Chris Field of Stanford. \u201cThe impacts of climate change almost always come packaged in extremes.\u201d",

Maybe I\u2019ll do one after that, we\u2019ll see,\u201d during a radio interview with Washington\u2019s WMAL Larry O\u2019Connor Show.\nCNN later reported that Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would hold a news conference at 9:30 a.m., though it was unclear if that would precede or follow the release of the report.\nBarr is expected to release the report to Congress and the public Thursday morning.\nWhile the president has claimed that the nearly 400-page report \u201ctotally\u201d exonerated him, Democrats aren\u2019t buying it and plan to seek an unredacted copy of Mueller\u2019s report, the culmination of a 23-month investigation.\nTrump is leaving later Thursday for a long holiday weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, and usually stops to speak with reporters on the White House lawn before boarding Marine One for the first leg of his trip.",

I don&rsquo;t care anymore, because at least I&rsquo;m trying and they&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; she <u><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal-critics-response-boss-a8794311.html\">said</a></u>.</p>\n<p>She continued:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So people are like &lsquo;Oh it&rsquo;s unrealistic, oh it&rsquo;s vague, oh it doesn&rsquo;t address this little minute thing&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m like &lsquo;You try! You do it!&rsquo; Because you&rsquo;re not, so until you do it, I&rsquo;m the boss, how about that?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ocasio-Cortez has also made some similar comments on her Twitter feed, such as this one:</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"> <p>Yup. If you don&rsquo;t like the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GreenNewDeal?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GreenNewDeal</a>, then come up with your own ambitious, on-scale proposal to address the global climate crisis.</p> <p>Until then, we&rsquo;re in charge &ndash; and you&rsquo;re just shouting from the cheap seats. <a href=\"https://t.co/h3KSJhHqDN\">https://t.co/h3KSJhHqDN</a></p> <p>&mdash; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1099126500924760064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 23, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Sorry, AOC &mdash; but this line of thinking is completely ridiculous. For one thing, someone should probably remind her that her job title is &ldquo;representative&rdquo; and not &ldquo;God.&rdquo; Her job is not to be a &ldquo;boss,&rdquo; but rather a <em>servant </em>of the people whom she represents. We aren&rsquo;t supposed to be working for her; she&rsquo;s supposed to be working<em> for us.</em></p>\n<p>Second of all, crowning yourself as &ldquo;the boss&rdquo; (or any other sort of superlative title) because you came up with a &ldquo;plan&rdquo; that <em>won&rsquo;t even work</em> is absurd. Make no mistake: No one with a fully functioning brain thinks it&rsquo;s viable to completely eliminate all carbon emissions in ten years. Even if it were, no one with even an ounce of understanding about the economy thinks it would be wise to enact something that would completely destroy a multitude of industries. How the hell are you putting yourself on a pedestal for coming up with a plan that doesn&rsquo;t work? I mean, if<em> I </em>suggested that we eliminate all of the carbon emissions from air travel by instead flying around on unicorns, would that make <em>me </em>&ldquo;the boss&rdquo;? Because honestly, my unicorn plan is about as feasible as Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s Green New Deal is.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s clear that Ocasio-Cortez thinks she&rsquo;s some kind of hero for at least &ldquo;trying&rdquo; to solve environmental issues, but the truth is, putting forth a &ldquo;plan&rdquo; that could never be executed does about as much good as putting forth nothing at all. After all, a plan that isn&rsquo;t feasible and the absence of a plan will have the same results &mdash; that is, no results at all. She, of course, would disagree; she&rsquo;d say that at least people are talking about it and then again credit herself for starting that conversation. That&rsquo;s obviously delusional . . . climate change and what to do about it have been major topics of discussion since I can remember, and anyone who has been paying even <em>any </em>attention would know that.</p>\n<p>Would the world be a better place if the United States eliminated all carbon emissions? Of course it would &mdash; just like it would be better if we all got free Lamborghinis. The truth, however, is that being a notable leader requires a lot more than just fantasizing about pie-in-the-sky proposals that have no real future. It requires having the kinds of ideas that actually <em>are </em>possible &mdash; and having a plan for how to execute them. It should go without saying, but in order to credit yourself with spearheading solutions to a problem, you probably should actually have some of them first.</p>",

I don\u2019t care anymore, because at least I\u2019m trying and they\u2019re not,\u201d she said.\nShe continued:\n\u201cSo people are like \u2018Oh it\u2019s unrealistic, oh it\u2019s vague, oh it doesn\u2019t address this little minute thing\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u2018You try! You do it!\u2019 Because you\u2019re not, so until you do it, I\u2019m the boss, how about that?\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez has also made some similar comments on her Twitter feed, such as this one:\nYup. If you don\u2019t like the #GreenNewDeal, then come up with your own ambitious, on-scale proposal to address the global climate crisis.\nUntil then, we\u2019re in charge \u2013 and you\u2019re just shouting from the cheap seats. https://t.co/h3KSJhHqDN\n\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 23, 2019\nSorry, AOC \u2014 but this line of thinking is completely ridiculous. For one thing, someone should probably remind her that her job title is \u201crepresentative\u201d and not \u201cGod.\u201d Her job is not to be a \u201cboss,\u201d but rather a servant of the people whom she represents. We aren\u2019t supposed to be working for her; she\u2019s supposed to be working for us.\nSecond of all, crowning yourself as \u201cthe boss\u201d (or any other sort of superlative title) because you came up with a \u201cplan\u201d that won\u2019t even work is absurd. Make no mistake: No one with a fully functioning brain thinks it\u2019s viable to completely eliminate all carbon emissions in ten years. Even if it were, no one with even an ounce of understanding about the economy thinks it would be wise to enact something that would completely destroy a multitude of industries. How the hell are you putting yourself on a pedestal for coming up with a plan that doesn\u2019t work? I mean, if I suggested that we eliminate all of the carbon emissions from air travel by instead flying around on unicorns, would that make me \u201cthe boss\u201d? Because honestly, my unicorn plan is about as feasible as Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal is.\nIt\u2019s clear that Ocasio-Cortez thinks she\u2019s some kind of hero for at least \u201ctrying\u201d to solve environmental issues, but the truth is, putting forth a \u201cplan\u201d that could never be executed does about as much good as putting forth nothing at all. After all, a plan that isn\u2019t feasible and the absence of a plan will have the same results \u2014 that is, no results at all. She, of course, would disagree; she\u2019d say that at least people are talking about it and then again credit herself for starting that conversation. That\u2019s obviously delusional . . . climate change and what to do about it have been major topics of discussion since I can remember, and anyone who has been paying even any attention would know that.\nWould the world be a better place if the United States eliminated all carbon emissions?

                "html": "<p>Senator Bernie Sanders, gamely making the case for socialism on CNN, offers a familiar argument: that access to health care and other goods like it should be understood as a &ldquo;right.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Properly understood, that claim is <em>literally</em> nonsensical, having the grammatical form of a sentence but no meaningful content, inasmuch as it is logically meaningless to declare a right in a scarce good. (I am using <em>scarce</em> here in its economic sense rather than in its common conversational sense.) For example: If you have twelve children and six cupcakes, the possibilities of division remain the same even if you declare that every child has the &ldquo;right&rdquo; to an entire cupcake of his own. Goods are physical, while rights are metaphysical, and the actual facts of the real world are not transformed by our deciding to <em>talk about them</em> in a different way. Other declarations in the same form &mdash; &ldquo;Health care is quintessentially axiomatic,&rdquo; &ldquo;Health care is candy-apple gray,&rdquo; &ldquo;Health care is a spastically cloistered bottle of courageous smoke,&rdquo; etc. &mdash; would be equally meaningless as sentences.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Health care is a right&rdquo; is a sentence that fools some people into thinking that it means something because the synthetic impression of moral urgency that accompanies the declaration of &ldquo;a right&rdquo; overwhelms the ordinary logical faculty, which in many people is less developed than the emotional endowment, that widespread condition being the principal defect in democracy. When a politician declares a &ldquo;right&rdquo; in a scarce good, it indicates either that he is a simpleton or that he believes you to be, and one&rsquo;s as good as the other, that being another defect in democracy.</p>\n<p>(Another defect in democracy is its apparently inability to learn, hence the Democratic embrace of <em>socialism</em> in 2019 in spite of socialism&rsquo;s unbroken track record of failure and brutality.)</p>\n<p>Senator Sanders points to the Scandinavian model as an example of what it means to have health care as a right. Senator Sanders has traveled widely in his life &mdash; he found much to praise in the Soviet Union while honeymooning there, and said so &mdash; but he is, like many American progressives, almost completely parochial. As is the case with the United Kingdom and much of Europe, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark are in the 21st century markedly different from the countries they were in the 1970s, when Senator Sanders&rsquo;s awareness of the world seems to have congealed into the impenetrable clot of ignorance on such ghastly display in his current political career. A generation of reform &mdash; including tax cuts and reductions in the scope of the public sector &mdash; have left the Scandinavian countries with lower public-sector spending than such European standard-bearers as France and Belgium. In the Heritage Foundation&rsquo;s economic-liberty rankings, the Scandinavian countries come in right alongside the United States &mdash; and behind such market-oriented leaders as Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. On many scores, the Scandinavian countries offer more robust free-market systems than does the United States.</p>\n<p>Another thing the Scandinavian countries have in common: Their politicians may talk about health care as a right sometimes, too, but in none of those countries is health care <em>free</em>.</p>\n<p>There isn&rsquo;t a single &ldquo;Scandinavian&rdquo; model of health care, but there are some features common in the set. One of them is that consumers pay out of pocket for health care, starting with copays but also extending to many specialist services, prescription drugs, dental care, and the like. In fact, as the Commonwealth Fund runs the numbers, private out-of-pocket spending on health care is proportionally <em>higher</em> in Sweden (about 16 percent of all health-care spending) than in the United States (about 11 percent). Out-of-pocket spending as a share of health-care costs is higher in Denmark (12 percent) and Norway (14 percent), too. (Statistical note: There is a small difference between <em>private</em> spending and <em>out-of-pocket</em> spending, but it is trivial in the Scandinavian cases cited here, with out-of-pocket spending accounting for 98 percent or so of private spending. Also, those figures are complicated by the fact that spending levels are different from country to country, and that the United States is an outlier; the Swedes spend more out-of-pocket as a share of a lower spending total, meaning that their out-of-pocket expenses are higher than U.S. rates as a share of medical costs but lower in absolute terms.) In other countries with widely admired health-care systems, out-of-pocket spending is even higher as a share of health-care costs: around 19 percent in Switzerland and 60 percent in Singapore.</p>\n<p>Those numbers in some ways say both more and less than it may seem, in that the U.S. employer-based health-insurance system plays a role similar to the social-insurance programs some other countries (it does not perform that role especially well), and a dollar taken out of your paycheck for health-care coverage is a dollar gone whether we call it a <em>tax</em> or an <em>insurance premium</em>. It is a peculiarity of the American system that we attempt to deputize employers to administer what is in many other countries part of the welfare state. As it stands, the U.S. system retains much of what people dislike about private care while incorporating much of what&rsquo;s undesirable about state-dominated systems: insecurity and relatively high costs<em> plus</em> sclerotic bureaucracy and cumbrous regulation &mdash; hooray for us.</p>\n<p>The numbers may not be quite what American progressives expect, but what is interesting about them is not so much what they tell us about economic incentives as what they tell us about health-care <em>attitudes</em>. <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/publication/ikeamerica-should-the-us-really-be-more-like-sweden-a-qa-with-economist-tino-sanandaji/\">In an interview with James Pethokoukis</a>, Swedish economist Tino Sanandaji links the social organizing principle behind the Scandinavian welfare states to what the Swedes refer to as <em>duktig</em> &mdash; loosely translated, &ldquo;competence.&rdquo; Citizens are understood not as baby birds with open beaks being fed by the state, but as having primary responsibility for themselves. &ldquo;It has the connotation that you have the social obligation to be competent,&rdquo; Sanandaji says.</p>\n<p>Not a <em>right</em>, but a <em>duty</em>.</p>\n<p>As a matter of national rhetoric, this is strongly emphasized in countries such as Switzerland and Singapore. That is one reason why the individual mandate to carry health insurance is uncontroversial in Switzerland. &ldquo;We consider the health insurance mandate to be a form of socially responsible civic conduct,&rdquo; former Swiss health minister Thomas Zeltner told <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0698\"><em>Health Affairs</em></a>. &ldquo;In Switzerland, &lsquo;individual freedom&rsquo; does not mean that you should be free to live irresponsibly and freeload from others.&rdquo; In the United States, the individual mandate has been effectively repealed, but even before that, the Supreme Court was obliged to participate in a silly charade that the mandate was an exercise of Congress&rsquo;s taxing authority in order for the law to even partly withstand a constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p>Adopting a rhetoric of <em>rights</em> is not going to simplify that. Fundamentally, health care is not a moral question but an economic one. That much can be demonstrated by the fact that even if every American agreed with Senator Sanders about health care as a moral question, we&rsquo;d still be obliged to approach it as an economic one &mdash; the moral consensus, even if it were not mistaken, would solve precisely nothing. Medical care costs something, and we have a social commitment to seeing to it that those costs don&rsquo;t come down on vulnerable people in an unnecessarily burdensome way, part of what F. A. Hayek described as &ldquo;providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.&rdquo; Contra Senator Sanders et al., this is not a project that require <em>socialism</em> in any degree.</p>\n<p>What it does require is responsibility &mdash; including responsible citizenship &mdash; and a clear-eyed understanding of the nature of the problem. What does it mean to be a responsible citizen? In the United States, we have a poor and diminished notion of citizenship, that citizens are only &ldquo;taxpayers&rdquo; and &ldquo;voters.&rdquo; Good citizens, in the inescapable contemporary formulation, are those who &ldquo;<a href=\"https://lamborn.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2119\">play by the rules and pay their taxes</a>.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the real individual mandate: Pay and obey. The progressive proposition is that, in exchange for this obedience, childlike citizens are to be provided for by government <em>in loco parentis</em>, and that their role in this is almost entirely passive: submit to taxation, follow the regulations, receive the benefits. Hence the rhetoric of health care as a right.</p>\n<p>A fuller and more mature notion of citizenship would be one that holds, as ours once did, that among the first duties of the citizen is to provide for himself and look after his family so as not to burden his neighbors unnecessarily. The rhetoric of benefits as rights cultivates just the opposite attitude, one of learned helplessness, not in response to extraordinary challenges but in the face of the ordinary business of life. That attitude of helplessness is of great benefit to a certain stripe of politician. It is not good for people or countries.</p>\n<p>And it isn&rsquo;t really characteristic of the Scandinavian societies that Senator Sanders thinks he admires.</p>",

                "text": "Senator Bernie Sanders, gamely making the case for socialism on CNN, offers a familiar argument: that access to health care and other goods like it should be understood as a \u201cright.\u201d\nProperly understood, that claim is literally nonsensical, having the grammatical form of a sentence but no meaningful content, inasmuch as it is logically meaningless to declare a right in a scarce good. (I am using scarce here in its economic sense rather than in its common conversational sense.) For example: If you have twelve children and six cupcakes, the possibilities of division remain the same even if you declare that every child has the \u201cright\u201d to an entire cupcake of his own. Goods are physical, while rights are metaphysical, and the actual facts of the real world are not transformed by our deciding to talk about them in a different way. Other declarations in the same form \u2014 \u201cHealth care is quintessentially axiomatic,\u201d \u201cHealth care is candy-apple gray,\u201d \u201cHealth care is a spastically cloistered bottle of courageous smoke,\u201d etc. \u2014 would be equally meaningless as sentences.\n\u201cHealth care is a right\u201d is a sentence that fools some people into thinking that it means something because the synthetic impression of moral urgency that accompanies the declaration of \u201ca right\u201d overwhelms the ordinary logical faculty, which in many people is less developed than the emotional endowment, that widespread condition being the principal defect in democracy. When a politician declares a \u201cright\u201d in a scarce good, it indicates either that he is a simpleton or that he believes you to be, and one\u2019s as good as the other, that being another defect in democracy.\n(Another defect in democracy is its apparently inability to learn, hence the Democratic embrace of socialism in 2019 in spite of socialism\u2019s unbroken track record of failure and brutality.)\nSenator Sanders points to the Scandinavian model as an example of what it means to have health care as a right. Senator Sanders has traveled widely in his life \u2014 he found much to praise in the Soviet Union while honeymooning there, and said so \u2014 but he is, like many American progressives, almost completely parochial. As is the case with the United Kingdom and much of Europe, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark are in the 21st century markedly different from the countries they were in the 1970s, when Senator Sanders\u2019s awareness of the world seems to have congealed into the impenetrable clot of ignorance on such ghastly display in his current political career. A generation of reform \u2014 including tax cuts and reductions in the scope of the public sector \u2014 have left the Scandinavian countries with lower public-sector spending than such European standard-bearers as France and Belgium. In the Heritage Foundation\u2019s economic-liberty rankings, the Scandinavian countries come in right alongside the United States \u2014 and behind such market-oriented leaders as Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. On many scores, the Scandinavian countries offer more robust free-market systems than does the United States.\nAnother thing the Scandinavian countries have in common: Their politicians may talk about health care as a right sometimes, too, but in none of those countries is health care free.\nThere isn\u2019t a single \u201cScandinavian\u201d model of health care, but there are some features common in the set. One of them is that consumers pay out of pocket for health care, starting with copays but also extending to many specialist services, prescription drugs, dental care, and the like. In fact, as the Commonwealth Fund runs the numbers, private out-of-pocket spending on health care is proportionally higher in Sweden (about 16 percent of all health-care spending) than in the United States (about 11 percent). Out-of-pocket spending as a share of health-care costs is higher in Denmark (12 percent) and Norway (14 percent), too. (Statistical note: There is a small difference between private spending and out-of-pocket spending, but it is trivial in the Scandinavian cases cited here, with out-of-pocket spending accounting for 98 percent or so of private spending. Also, those figures are complicated by the fact that spending levels are different from country to country, and that the United States is an outlier; the Swedes spend more out-of-pocket as a share of a lower spending total, meaning that their out-of-pocket expenses are higher than U.S. rates as a share of medical costs but lower in absolute terms.) In other countries with widely admired health-care systems, out-of-pocket spending is even higher as a share of health-care costs: around 19 percent in Switzerland and 60 percent in Singapore.\nThose numbers in some ways say both more and less than it may seem, in that the U.S. employer-based health-insurance system plays a role similar to the social-insurance programs some other countries (it does not perform that role especially well), and a dollar taken out of your paycheck for health-care coverage is a dollar gone whether we call it a tax or an insurance premium. It is a peculiarity of the American system that we attempt to deputize employers to administer what is in many other countries part of the welfare state. As it stands, the U.S. system retains much of what people dislike about private care while incorporating much of what\u2019s undesirable about state-dominated systems: insecurity and relatively high costs plus sclerotic bureaucracy and cumbrous regulation \u2014 hooray for us.\nThe numbers may not be quite what American progressives expect, but what is interesting about them is not so much what they tell us about economic incentives as what they tell us about health-care attitudes. In an interview with James Pethokoukis, Swedish economist Tino Sanandaji links the social organizing principle behind the Scandinavian welfare states to what the Swedes refer to as duktig \u2014 loosely translated, \u201ccompetence.\u201d Citizens are understood not as baby birds with open beaks being fed by the state, but as having primary responsibility for themselves. \u201cIt has the connotation that you have the social obligation to be competent,\u201d Sanandaji says.\nNot a right, but a duty.\nAs a matter of national rhetoric, this is strongly emphasized in countries such as Switzerland and Singapore. That is one reason why the individual mandate to carry health insurance is uncontroversial in Switzerland. \u201cWe consider the health insurance mandate to be a form of socially responsible civic conduct,\u201d former Swiss health minister Thomas Zeltner told Health Affairs. \u201cIn Switzerland, \u2018individual freedom\u2019 does not mean that you should be free to live irresponsibly and freeload from others.\u201d In the United States, the individual mandate has been effectively repealed, but even before that, the Supreme Court was obliged to participate in a silly charade that the mandate was an exercise of Congress\u2019s taxing authority in order for the law to even partly withstand a constitutional challenge.\nAdopting a rhetoric of rights is not going to simplify that. Fundamentally, health care is not a moral question but an economic one. That much can be demonstrated by the fact that even if every American agreed with Senator Sanders about health care as a moral question, we\u2019d still be obliged to approach it as an economic one \u2014 the moral consensus, even if it were not mistaken, would solve precisely nothing. Medical care costs something, and we have a social commitment to seeing to it that those costs don\u2019t come down on vulnerable people in an unnecessarily burdensome way, part of what F. A. Hayek described as \u201cproviding for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.\u201d Contra Senator Sanders et al., this is not a project that require socialism in any degree.\nWhat it does require is responsibility \u2014 including responsible citizenship \u2014 and a clear-eyed understanding of the nature of the problem. What does it mean to be a responsible citizen? In the United States, we have a poor and diminished notion of citizenship, that citizens are only \u201ctaxpayers\u201d and \u201cvoters.\u201d Good citizens, in the inescapable contemporary formulation, are those who \u201cplay by the rules and pay their taxes.\u201d That\u2019s the real individual mandate: Pay and obey. The progressive proposition is that, in exchange for this obedience, childlike citizens are to be provided for by government in loco parentis, and that their role in this is almost entirely passive: submit to taxation, follow the regulations, receive the benefits. Hence the rhetoric of health care as a right.\nA fuller and more mature notion of citizenship would be one that holds, as ours once did, that among the first duties of the citizen is to provide for himself and look after his family so as not to burden his neighbors unnecessarily. The rhetoric of benefits as rights cultivates just the opposite attitude, one of learned helplessness, not in response to extraordinary challenges but in the face of the ordinary business of life. That attitude of helplessness is of great benefit to a certain stripe of politician. It is not good for people or countries.\nAnd it isn\u2019t really characteristic of the Scandinavian societies that Senator Sanders thinks he admires.",

                "html": "<p>There is a strange political conversation under way as the 2020 Democratic presidential primary gets under way, and it goes like this: One group of Democrats proposes something daffy, vague, and impractical, and another group of Democrats says, &ldquo;Of course that&rsquo;s daffy, vague, and impractical &mdash; but at least they started a conversation!&rdquo; This is said in the tone kindergarten teachers use with toddlers who test the maxim that there is no such thing as a dumb question. It&rsquo;s something to see: a political party condescending to itself.</p>\n<p>None of the Democratic 2020 contenders currently talking up reparations for slavery is serious about the project. Those of them who are serious about anything are serious only about winning the party&rsquo;s nomination and the role that flattering a small but influential congregation of left-wing intellectuals might play in that.</p>\n<p>Call it the Ta-Nehisi Coates primary.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s an unserious proposal, but we&rsquo;ll do its authors the courtesy of offering a serious answer, anyway.</p>\n<p>Paying reparations for slavery is a terrible idea because there is no one to pay reparations and no one to pay them to. There are not any slave-owners left among us and haven&rsquo;t been for some time. There aren&rsquo;t any liberated slaves, either. Slavery was a terrible crime and, like all such enormities, it was carried out by real people who inflicted unconscionable suffering on real people &mdash; <em>specific</em> people, individuals.</p>\n<p>Our progressive friends like to talk about their high regard for &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; but they are blind to the real thing: Neither the white population of the United States nor the black one is homogenous; relatively few living white Americans are the heirs, however distant, of slave owners, and a significant and growing population of black Americans has no link to antebellum slavery at all. Some of them, like Barack Obama, are the offspring of more recent African immigrants; others are immigrants from the Caribbean and elsewhere who may have family links to slavery but not to American slavery. The question of what it means to be an &ldquo;African American&rdquo; grows more complex by the day.</p>\n<p>Such considerations are significant if we are to avoid sinking into the morass of willful racism <em>as a public-policy criterion</em>, insisting upon collective racial culpability and collective racial entitlement.

It\u2019s something to see: a political party condescending to itself.\nNone of the Democratic 2020 contenders currently talking up reparations for slavery is serious about the project. Those of them who are serious about anything are serious only about winning the party\u2019s nomination and the role that flattering a small but influential congregation of left-wing intellectuals might play in that.\nCall it the Ta-Nehisi Coates primary.\nIt\u2019s an unserious proposal, but we\u2019ll do its authors the courtesy of offering a serious answer, anyway.\nPaying reparations for slavery is a terrible idea because there is no one to pay reparations and no one to pay them to. There are not any slave-owners left among us and haven\u2019t been for some time. There aren\u2019t any liberated slaves, either. Slavery was a terrible crime and, like all such enormities, it was carried out by real people who inflicted unconscionable suffering on real people \u2014 specific people, individuals.\nOur progressive friends like to talk about their high regard for \u201cdiversity,\u201d but they are blind to the real thing: Neither the white population of the United States nor the black one is homogenous; relatively few living white Americans are the heirs, however distant, of slave owners, and a significant and growing population of black Americans has no link to antebellum slavery at all. Some of them, like Barack Obama, are the offspring of more recent African immigrants; others are immigrants from the Caribbean and elsewhere who may have family links to slavery but not to American slavery. The question of what it means to be an \u201cAfrican American\u201d grows more complex by the day.\nSuch considerations are significant if we are to avoid sinking into the morass of willful racism as a public-policy criterion, insisting upon collective racial culpability and collective racial entitlement. These ideas are alien to the fundamental American creed of individual rights and individual liberties \u2014 indeed, we have been at our very worst on racial issues when we as a nation have failed to live up to those ideals, as unfortunately has been the case all too often in our history.\nNone of this diminishes the unique evil that was American slavery, or the ways in which African Americans have been \u2014 and, in some cases, remain \u2014 systematically disadvantaged both by formal policy and by ordinary private prejudice. And it is not the case that all of these disadvantages are the result of poverty and hence easily addressed by policies that take no account of race, racism, or the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow. But neither is it the case that these persistent problems are likely to be solved by a series of cash transfers administered by self-seeking political entrepreneurs.\nTo insist that our public policies do not entrench collectivist racial politics is not the same as naively pretending that the world takes no notice of race or that it does not matter.

You read that headline and immediately think, &ldquo;alarmist clickbait.&rdquo; First, no one&rsquo;s ending the filibuster &mdash; at least not anytime soon. Second, even if the next Democratic Senate destroys the filibuster, what&rsquo;s the big deal? The Republicans will make the Democrats look as short-sighted as Harry Reid when he nuked the judicial filibuster. Both sides will get their free shot at legislation.</p>\n<p>Yes, both sides will get their free shot, and that&rsquo;s exactly the problem.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the first question for a minute. Is there a chance that if a Democrat wins the White House in 2020, and the Democrats win a narrow majority in the Senate, they&rsquo;ll attempt to repeal the legislative filibuster? Will the pressure to implement a triumphant progressive president&rsquo;s agenda be so overwhelming that Democratic senators will feel they have no choice? After all, there&rsquo;s no real path to single-payer or gun control or key aspects of the Green New Deal absent the &ldquo;nuclear option.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/opinion/senate-filibuster.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage\">very argument Jamelle Bouie makes</a> in today&rsquo;s <em>New York Times</em>, in a piece urging Democratic presidential candidates to &ldquo;come out against the filibuster.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are long past the days of large, bipartisan majorities for ambitious, far-reaching legislation. Just three Republican senators backed the 2009 stimulus and not one voted for the Affordable Care Act. Critics see this as evidence these laws were too liberal, but in truth it reflects structural change in American politics. The parties are polarized and ideologically coherent; they offer fundamentally different visions for the direction of the country. A President Booker or Klobuchar might seek Republican support for their agendas, but they won&rsquo;t likely find it. The legislative path for their policies &mdash; to say nothing of a Green New Deal or universal child care &mdash; will go entirely through the Democratic Party.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bouie notes that most of the Democratic contenders don&rsquo;t favor filibuster repeal, but Elizabeth Warren has said that &ldquo;all options are on the table&rdquo; and Kamala Harris has said she is &ldquo;conflicted.&rdquo; The <em>Times</em>&rsquo; David Leonhardt used Bouie&rsquo;s argument as a launching pad to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/opinion/filibuster-democrats-2020.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fdavid-leonhardt&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection\">explore the pros and cons</a> of filibuster reform. We are now in the midst of a live debate.</p>\n<p>Let me begin by concurring with Bouie. Here we share an agreed upon set of facts, at least. Absent filibuster reform (or an unforeseen wave election in the Senate), our nation is presently too polarized and too closely divided to enact &ldquo;ambitious, far-reaching legislation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Bouie looks at those facts and says, &ldquo;Step on the gas.&rdquo; I look at them and say, &ldquo;Tap the brakes.&rdquo; If we think American electoral politics are fraught now, with more apocalyptic rhetoric filling the air each day, just imagine if each new election brought with it the realistic possibility of a truly <em>fundamental</em> swing in national policy. Single-payer might be passed in one presidential term and upended in the next. Gun-control regimes could swing wildly from president to president. And, critically, each swing would be accompanied by a convulsive, toxic political debate that deepened and intensified American polarization.</p>\n<p>As a caution against filibuster reform, Leonhardt points to this tweet from Tufts political scientist Eitan Hersh:</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"> <p>Step 1: Ds win presidency and senate</p> <p>Step 2: get rid of filibuster </p> <p>Step 3: overreach </p> <p>Step 4: lose all branches in 2024</p> <p>Step 5: undo everything done and more </p> <p>&ndash; am I missing something?</p> <p>&mdash; Eitan Hersh (@eitanhersh) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eitanhersh/status/1100130644858990592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 25, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Hersh is right, and his analysis applies to both parties. After all, the golden rule of modern American partisanship is do unto the other worse than they did unto you. Imagine, years down the road, sweeping California-style gun control passed after a particularly heinous mass murder, a law that would render millions of Americans criminals in an instant. It would trigger extraordinary resistance in red states and likely galvanize efforts at nullification.</p>\n<p>Conversely, imagine Democrats&rsquo; panic at the fragility of their social-justice initiatives. The instant a new Republican president and Senate was sworn in, protests would paralyze the capital as the new legislature worked quickly to repeal everything from health-care legislation to new climate-change laws.</p>\n<p>Moreover, let&rsquo;s not forget that if the filibuster dies, it will die at a moment when our political culture remains in thrall to an endless cycle of Twitter-driven overreaction and outrage. The pressure for decisive legislative action in response to traumatic events will remain overwhelming. Ending the filibuster would mean that change would suddenly became not just possible but mandatory &mdash; and, given the extent of ideological polarization, dramatic, too.</p>\n<p>Look at this chart.

                "text": "I know what some of you are thinking. You read that headline and immediately think, \u201calarmist clickbait.\u201d First, no one\u2019s ending the filibuster \u2014 at least not anytime soon. Second, even if the next Democratic Senate destroys the filibuster, what\u2019s the big deal? The Republicans will make the Democrats look as short-sighted as Harry Reid when he nuked the judicial filibuster. Both sides will get their free shot at legislation.\nYes, both sides will get their free shot, and that\u2019s exactly the problem.\nLet\u2019s go back to the first question for a minute. Is there a chance that if a Democrat wins the White House in 2020, and the Democrats win a narrow majority in the Senate, they\u2019ll attempt to repeal the legislative filibuster? Will the pressure to implement a triumphant progressive president\u2019s agenda be so overwhelming that Democratic senators will feel they have no choice? After all, there\u2019s no real path to single-payer or gun control or key aspects of the Green New Deal absent the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d\nIn fact, that\u2019s the very argument Jamelle Bouie makes in today\u2019s New York Times, in a piece urging Democratic presidential candidates to \u201ccome out against the filibuster.\u201d\nWe are long past the days of large, bipartisan majorities for ambitious, far-reaching legislation. Just three Republican senators backed the 2009 stimulus and not one voted for the Affordable Care Act. Critics see this as evidence these laws were too liberal, but in truth it reflects structural change in American politics. The parties are polarized and ideologically coherent; they offer fundamentally different visions for the direction of the country. A President Booker or Klobuchar might seek Republican support for their agendas, but they won\u2019t likely find it. The legislative path for their policies \u2014 to say nothing of a Green New Deal or universal child care \u2014 will go entirely through the Democratic Party.\nBouie notes that most of the Democratic contenders don\u2019t favor filibuster repeal, but Elizabeth Warren has said that \u201call options are on the table\u201d and Kamala Harris has said she is \u201cconflicted.\u201d The Times\u2019 David Leonhardt used Bouie\u2019s argument as a launching pad to explore the pros and cons of filibuster reform. We are now in the midst of a live debate.\nLet me begin by concurring with Bouie. Here we share an agreed upon set of facts, at least. Absent filibuster reform (or an unforeseen wave election in the Senate), our nation is presently too polarized and too closely divided to enact \u201cambitious, far-reaching legislation.\u201d\nBut Bouie looks at those facts and says, \u201cStep on the gas.\u201d I look at them and say, \u201cTap the brakes.\u201d If we think American electoral politics are fraught now, with more apocalyptic rhetoric filling the air each day, just imagine if each new election brought with it the realistic possibility of a truly fundamental swing in national policy. Single-payer might be passed in one presidential term and upended in the next. Gun-control regimes could swing wildly from president to president. And, critically, each swing would be accompanied by a convulsive, toxic political debate that deepened and intensified American polarization.\nAs a caution against filibuster reform, Leonhardt points to this tweet from Tufts political scientist Eitan Hersh:\nStep 1: Ds win presidency and senate\nStep 2: get rid of filibuster\nStep 3: overreach\nStep 4: lose all branches in 2024\nStep 5: undo everything done and more\n\u2013 am I missing something?\n\u2014 Eitan Hersh (@eitanhersh) February 25, 2019\nHersh is right, and his analysis applies to both parties. After all, the golden rule of modern American partisanship is do unto the other worse than they did unto you. Imagine, years down the road, sweeping California-style gun control passed after a particularly heinous mass murder, a law that would render millions of Americans criminals in an instant. It would trigger extraordinary resistance in red states and likely galvanize efforts at nullification.\nConversely, imagine Democrats\u2019 panic at the fragility of their social-justice initiatives. The instant a new Republican president and Senate was sworn in, protests would paralyze the capital as the new legislature worked quickly to repeal everything from health-care legislation to new climate-change laws.\nMoreover, let\u2019s not forget that if the filibuster dies, it will die at a moment when our political culture remains in thrall to an endless cycle of Twitter-driven overreaction and outrage. The pressure for decisive legislative action in response to traumatic events will remain overwhelming. Ending the filibuster would mean that change would suddenly became not just possible but mandatory \u2014 and, given the extent of ideological polarization, dramatic, too.\nLook at this chart. Ponder this chart. Memorize this chart:\nGone are the nice ideological bell curves of American generations past, when large majorities shared a degree of relative moderation. Welcome to an America that\u2019s trending closer to a \u201cU\u201d curve, in which the two sides glare at each other from across a widening chasm.\nUsing temporary, slim majorities to push sweeping, nation-changing legislation is like playing with matches in a gasoline spill. At the very least, it\u2019s a recipe for increasing bitterness, division, and instability in public policy. At worst, it\u2019s a recipe for outright state-level defiance. I wonder: How would blue states respond if a slight GOP majority passed a national heartbeat bill, a law that would essentially ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy? It\u2019s easy to imagine a meltdown.\nAnd don\u2019t for one moment believe that overreach isn\u2019t inevitable. If there is one thing that\u2019s constant in modern American politics, it\u2019s irrational partisan exuberance after every electoral win. Even close wins \u2014 like Trump\u2019s in 2016 \u2014 usher in talk of \u201cpermanent realignments.\u201d Partisans behave as if a mandate exists for their policies whether it actually does or not.\nFinally, lest we despair of ever enacting meaningful reform, let\u2019s not forget that patient and persistent public advocacy can still work. Just recently, Congress passed criminal-justice reform with huge bipartisan majorities \u2014 an important change that was politically unthinkable not very long ago. No, it\u2019s not the national transformation that activists seek, but Pyrrhic legislative victories aren\u2019t victories at all, and sweeping change absent sweeping consensus will inflict deep costs on the American body politic.\nThe filibuster helps lower the true stakes of American elections. It\u2019s one of the last measures left in American politics that limits the centralization of power. And it helps ensure that significant reform carries with it significant public support. It\u2019s a check on the very forces that could tear our nation apart. It must be preserved.",

Dianne Feinstein was confronted in her San Francisco office by a group of students who demanded that she vote for the Green New Deal.</p>\n<p>The 83-year-old Feinstein has spent, as she told her visitors, the &ldquo;last quarter-century&rdquo; in the Senate and was clearly under the impression that her r&eacute;sum&eacute; ought to inspire a degree of respect, if not deference, from the students. But when she told them she wouldn&rsquo;t do their bidding, the group from the Sunrise Movement &mdash; which gained notoriety earlier this year with a sit-in at the office of House speaker Nancy Pelosi (where Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made a guest appearance) &mdash; was having none of it.</p>\n<p>The teenagers had zero interest in Feinstein&rsquo;s arguments about how bills get passed and the art of the possible. Nor were they impressed by her ideas about promoting some of the same goals in proposed legislation that, as she pointed out, had a better chance of being enacted into law than does their laundry list of demands. Instead, they cast the choice before the country as a stark ultimatum: Do what we say, even if it means trashing the economy and abruptly changing American culture, or be counted among the evildoers who are killing the planet.</p>\n<p>Most of the Left&rsquo;s commentary on the viral video focused on Feinstein&rsquo;s grouchy demeanor and her effrontery in lecturing the kids about the way Congress works. The liberal consensus is that the senator should have been the one showing deference to the bright young things rather than the other way around.</p>\n<p>If Feinstein&rsquo;s reaction seemed so out of place to her media and activist critics, it&rsquo;s because it flies in the face of the adoring coverage that teenage liberal activists have been getting lately. Examples go beyond the Green New Dealers who sassed the California senator. Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg has become an international celebrity with her weekly boycotts of school to picket her country&rsquo;s parliament and with her grim lectures to European parliamentarians.</p>\n<p>The same can be said for the role played by some of the survivors of last year&rsquo;s Parkland shooting, as newly minted celebrity activists attacked opponents without blinking an eye, showing disgust at the notion that critics of their ideas deserved a hearing.</p>\n<p>There is a clear public interest in encouraging young people to care about politics and policy. That&rsquo;s especially true in an era when the study of what used to be called civics and government is given short shrift &mdash; if not ignored &mdash; in many high-school curricula. But while interest in public issues is a good thing, the kind of activism practiced by the Sunrise Movement, Thunberg, or the Parkland kids is not one in which the democratic process or the notion of give and take has any place.</p>\n<p>On the environment, global-warming alarmists may have failed to convince enough American voters that the world is soon coming to an end to get their way on legislation, but the extremists have won over children, from Feinstein&rsquo;s guests to Thunberg. Though Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s initial fact sheet for the Green New Deal &mdash; which mentioned the problems of flatulent cows and air travel &mdash; inspired derision even among many liberals, to the youthful supporters of extremist climate-change proposals, those are reasonable ideas.</p>\n<p>Ocasio-Cortez deflected the discussion about the cows into a critique of factory farming, while insisting that not everyone had to go vegan. Thunberg disagrees. The 16-year-old was the subject of a revealing profile in the<em> New York Times</em> last week that discussed how her activism is a form of therapy for the devastating depression she suffered as an adolescent.</p>\n<p>Thunberg is apparently happier now that advocacy on the climate has given her life meaning, but her primary means of communication is lecturing. Like the Sunrise Movement kids, she has no patience for any discussion about the havoc that might result were her absolutist views put into action.</p>\n<p>The problem is that few have done what Feinstein did on the viral video and told these teenagers that their &ldquo;my way or the highway&rdquo; approach won&rsquo;t wash. The belief that young people must be obeyed seems to be the guiding principle for those covering their advocacy. Of course, attacks on young activists, such as some of the nastier comments about the Parkland kids in the weeks after the shooting, are uncalled for, but nobody, even teenagers, should demonize others with impunity because of their political beliefs.</p>\n<p>Young activists may be entitled to treat their beliefs as earthshaking revelations, even if the wiser among them will someday look back on their extremist views with a little embarrassment. But too few adults are paying heed to their profound hostility to the democratic process &mdash; a process that depends on its participants&rsquo; treating opposing views with respect and bothering to answer criticisms.

To date, the most lethal intoxicants that have been extolled by some of the candidates are legalized infanticide, open borders, reparations to African and other minority Americans, nationalized health care, a fascistic and Luddite green policy, and top personal-tax rates above 70 per cent. So far, this cocktail, which is such an assault on the sanity of an electorate that it could reduce the Democrats to splinters, has scared off Michael Bloomberg, Sherrod Brown, and Hillary Clinton (though she is probably contemplating her legal future with some well-founded consternation too).</p>\n<p>But another candidate-benefactor is also in sight, and so hyperactive and in his way irresistible that it is hard to get him out of your sight. Beto O&rsquo;Rourke is stoking up one the great bonfires of modern political history; he is a phenomenon of these strange times so unique that no one could have imagined him. Even the Trump-hating media, desperate to find a Democrat who can win, in despair at the collapse of the impeachment bubble, demoralized and hung over from pelagic overconsumption of sour Kool Aid, are taking a break from their sacred mission to destroy Trump. They are not turning their swords into ploughshares, but some sort of quasi-Biblical grace of change is occurring.</p>\n<p>All of the Democratic candidates and the entire political process are being taken over and occupied by the invasion of the whole public space by Robert Francis O&rsquo;Rourke. No one has ever heard or seen anything like this candidate: a hyperactive limb-flailing imbecile, babbling compulsively in a torrent of extremist nonsense barely couched in comprehensible syntax. No idea is too stupid to be endorsed in terms of absolute finality: &ldquo;If we do not abolish all fossil fuels within twelve years, everything on the planet will be dead. The scientists are 100 percent united on this. Just as Americans of the past had to fight at Normandy, we have to fight this now, and save our planet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It does not require an immensely sophisticated political scientist to see that there are a few problems with that sequence, as there are with all Beto&rsquo;s sentences, and with his much more numerous and even more idiotic non-sentences. The invasion of Normandy in 1944 has become a metaphor for urgent, brave, and imaginative action&mdash;very deservedly, as it was the greatest single military operation in history: moving ten divisions in the teeth of the German army and air force from England to France in one day, beginning the liberation of Western Europe. It is now being bandied about as an operation to be emulated even in the most mundane circumstances: D-Day was invoked in an advertisement for an automobile dealership that I heard on the radio last week. As an Anglo-Canadian, I hope I will be pardoned for mentioning that a majority of the beaches, and of the personnel who descended on northern France that day, by sea and by air, were British and Canadians, who also provided most of the 7,000 ships, and about half of the nearly 15,000 aircraft, and under General Dwight Eisenhower as supreme commander, all of the individual service chiefs. (The maritime commander, Admiral Bertram Ramsay, had masterminded the miraculous evacuation from Dunkirk four years before, and the defense against invasion threats after that, and brought the men back at D-Day and in succeeding months, in overwhelming strength.)</p>\n<p>It is an operation to praise, but when Beto O&rsquo;Rourke is comparing the Battle of Normandy to saving the earth from carbon use as he waves his arms around in an Iowa high school, the electoral process is becoming worryingly unserious. (Cory Booker, who is no prize for intellectual depth either, was using the same metaphor in a similar Iowa setting, but spared us the frenetic hand signals.) O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s great and presumably unsought contribution to this campaign is that he is going to attract the fire of all the media, very soon. They are already shifting. The immense, grunting media monsters, snorting fire and pawing the ground and trying in their Jurassic minds to think of how to lay this president low, have picked up the succulent scent of a ludicrous and clangorous political imposture ardently seeking its own destruction. The media of America will not allow this asinine mockery of a presidential campaign to go another week before it picks up this wild, scrawny, noisy, incoherent nincompoop and shreds him. Somehow, he raised $8.5 million running for the U.S. Senate in Texas, and came close to ousting Ted Cruz. A special psychiatric counsel should be appointed to find out what peculiar mass mental infirmity afflicted millions of Texans to consider this quack.</p>\n<p>Let us be clear: This isn&rsquo;t a matter of policy differences. This man is a boob, a dolt. He is vulgar and ungrammatical, knows nothing, and makes no sense. He can&rsquo;t keep his mouth shut for five seconds and he is wired like an early helicopter with a vertical rotor on its tail: he can&rsquo;t gabble out his nonsense without waving his arms around. He knows everything, meaning nothing, is incapable of making a correct factual statement, and throws in the f-word for emphasis, even where there is nothing to emphasize. Yet he is performing a valuable role: This is the candidate the media have been looking for. They savagely attacked Donald Trump three years ago because they thought he was a rich vulgarian blowhard who couldn&rsquo;t speak in sentences, didn&rsquo;t know anything, couldn&rsquo;t run a two-car funeral, stole his money, and colluded illegally with a foreign power. There was never any truth to any of that, apart from Trump&rsquo;s boorishness at times, which has almost completely ended. But Trump had some weak moments.</p>\n<p>Now we have the coruscation, the magic deliverance of the process. Almost everything they said about Trump, except the source of his money and any foreign connection (which was a pack of lies in respect of Trump anyway), applies to Beto. The mighty and malicious meat-grinder of the American national political media, twitching and drooling in anticipation, is turning toward Beto, scarcely believing the noisy and juicy helplessness of this victim. Individual wildebeests don&rsquo;t taunt prides of lions, any more than swimmers cock their noses at nearby crocodiles. This is one for the record books. George Romney didn&rsquo;t quite realize the implications of saying he had been &ldquo;brainwashed&rdquo; in Vietnam. (LBJ said he must have gone quietly into a corner and &ldquo;brainwashed himself.&rdquo;) Gary Hart had a bit of a political death wish and set them a chase in 1984. Howard Dean didn&rsquo;t mean to behave like a raving dunce in 2004; he just couldn&rsquo;t help himself. Senator Fred Thompson didn&rsquo;t really want to run in 2008 and folded with a little dignity.</p>\n<p>Beto has asked, screamed and flailed, gesticulated, run long distances, and jumped through hoops for the attention he is about to get. Anyone who launches his campaign in <em>Vanity Fair</em>, the most vulgar magazine in the western world, has arrived at the gallows voluntarily ahead of the executioner. In a month, there will be nothing left of him but a few feathers floating in the spring air. And now for the emollient and curative aspect of the Beto moment. The national political media are a savage beast, and they are now an extremely vicious beast because they have been beaten badly by President Trump. They are going to have to cover his implicit exoneration and the intense questioning and in some cases indictments of those who manipulated them. The famished devouring of this delicious self-proffered victim will not sate their antagonisms or slake their blood-lust, but it will be a tasty sorbet, a textbook candidate demolition to show they can still do it when they get the target right. And there is nothing like a good clean public execution to calm everyone down.</p>\n<p>With Beto under their belts, they will have the chance to deescalate with dignity, if not honor, as they prepare themselves for the president&rsquo;s likely reelection.</p>\n<figure><figcaption> <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/author/conrad-black/\">Conrad Black</a>&rsquo;s latest book is <em>Donald J.

This is the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/kamala-harris-wants-end-private-health-insurance-new-democratic-litmus-n964241\">emerging Democratic consensus</a>.</p>\n<p>This is only a partial list of Democratic power moves to the left, including calls to fundamentally transform longstanding constitutional structures and institutions. What is going on? Are these all conviction moves by progressive politicians telling the American people what they <em>really</em> believe? Are these politicians merely reflecting and amplifying the deeply held views of the Democratic rank-and-file?</p>\n<p>Certainly the Democratic <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/246806/understanding-shifts-democratic-party-ideology.aspx?g_source=link_NEWSV9&g_medium=TOPIC&g_campaign=item_&g_content=Understanding%2520Shifts%2520in%2520Democratic%2520Party%2520Ideology\">mainstream has become more liberal</a>, and its left-most cohorts are white, female, college-educated, and young. In other words, I just described <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/twitter-demographics/\">many of the key demographics of American Twitter</a> &mdash; the platform that exercises a wildly disproportionate influence on politicians, journalists, and political activists. The dominant feedback loop in the early primary isn&rsquo;t just from the motivated base (which would be entirely normal), but a motivated base amplified by a specific social-media platform.</p>\n<p>Yes, radical Democratic pronouncements will earn them a wave of negative media attention on Fox News and in conservative media, but not a single Democratic candidate is trying to win <em>that</em> demographic. Indeed, a wave of Fox News hate is good for the brand. But if a Democratic candidate breaks in even small ways from the emerging online orthodoxy, watch them trend on Twitter. Watch them get viciously dragged in real time in front of every single leading progressive politician, activist, and journalist in the United States. It takes a brave person to withstand the attack, especially when there is precious little short-term advantage in confronting the online Left.</p>\n<p>This immediate, public, toxic, and often vicious or scornful feedback amplifies existing primary-season pressures to move leftward &mdash; just as the same kind of immediate toxic reaction can cow conservatives who oppose Trump. These attacks aren&rsquo;t just read by campaign staffers. They also provide fodder for journalists, and they can quickly create narratives that dog candidates for days or weeks.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not arguing that primary-season purity tests are anything new. Republicans have been through those wars, and now the GOP purity test is centered around loyalty to Trump. But these days Twitter &mdash; which has developed into a hysterical platform prone to mobbing and shaming &mdash; amplifies and intensifies preexisting primary pressures. Now, a strategy to prevent poor optics on Twitter will push Democratic candidates further and further to the left, as they express &ldquo;openness&rdquo; to ideas they&rsquo;d never otherwise entertain, all to avoid the backlash.</p>\n<p>As I&rsquo;ve argued before, Twitter is so influential in part because that&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/01/political-twitter-even-more-toxic-than-thought/\">where the people who care the most spend their time</a>. The people who care the most about <em>anything</em> &mdash; from politics to sports to pop culture &mdash; set the tone. And in American politics, the people who care the most tend not to be moderate, either in temperament <em>or</em> ideology.</p>\n<p>By the time progressive Twitter has done its work on the Democratic field, the American people may no longer have the ability to choose true American norms in 2020. They may well encounter a choice between an extremist personality with a relatively center-right or populist agenda and a more normal personality who seeks to enact extremist policies. If suburban voters long for not radical change but rather a more reasonable politics, where will they turn?</p>\n<p>But Democrats &mdash; indeed, both parties &mdash; need to remember that while Twitter has disproportionate influence on activists and elites, there&rsquo;s little evidence that its outrages and controversies penetrate the wider world. An incident from this past week speaks volumes. If you&rsquo;d only watched Twitter, you&rsquo;d think that Beto&rsquo;s presidential announcement was a bust. The Bernie Brigades &mdash; which punch well above their weight online &mdash; gang-tackled Beto on social media. He wasn&rsquo;t taking on Ted Cruz, he was taking on the heroes of the progressive movement, and the honeymoon was most definitely over.</p>\n<p>Twitter pronounced its verdict: His announcement was a bust. His campaign was days old, but he was already struggling. And then we learned Beto had <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/18/18271222/beto-orourke-fundraising-haul-2020-sanders\">out-raised every other Democratic candidate</a> &mdash; including Bernie &mdash; in the first 24 hours of his campaign.</p>\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean Beto is a favorite. Nor does it mean that he&rsquo;s immune to Twitter&rsquo;s progressive temptations. Just yesterday he backed abortion-on-demand even into the third trimester. He has backed the Green New Deal. He&rsquo;s even advocated tearing down parts of the <em>existing</em> border wall. But it does mean that sensible politicians and sensible members of their staffs would do well to remember that the praise they earn online may well spell their doom at the ballot box. Twitter politics is extremist politics, and fighting one norm-breaker by creating another is an excellent way for the Democrats to fail again.</p>",

And in American politics, the people who care the most tend not to be moderate, either in temperament or ideology.\nBy the time progressive Twitter has done its work on the Democratic field, the American people may no longer have the ability to choose true American norms in 2020. They may well encounter a choice between an extremist personality with a relatively center-right or populist agenda and a more normal personality who seeks to enact extremist policies. If suburban voters long for not radical change but rather a more reasonable politics, where will they turn?\nBut Democrats \u2014 indeed, both parties \u2014 need to remember that while Twitter has disproportionate influence on activists and elites, there\u2019s little evidence that its outrages and controversies penetrate the wider world. An incident from this past week speaks volumes. If you\u2019d only watched Twitter, you\u2019d think that Beto\u2019s presidential announcement was a bust. The Bernie Brigades \u2014 which punch well above their weight online \u2014 gang-tackled Beto on social media. He wasn\u2019t taking on Ted Cruz, he was taking on the heroes of the progressive movement, and the honeymoon was most definitely over.\nTwitter pronounced its verdict: His announcement was a bust. His campaign was days old, but he was already struggling. And then we learned Beto had out-raised every other Democratic candidate \u2014 including Bernie \u2014 in the first 24 hours of his campaign.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Beto is a favorite. Nor does it mean that he\u2019s immune to Twitter\u2019s progressive temptations. Just yesterday he backed abortion-on-demand even into the third trimester. He has backed the Green New Deal. He\u2019s even advocated tearing down parts of the existing border wall. But it does mean that sensible politicians and sensible members of their staffs would do well to remember that the praise they earn online may well spell their doom at the ballot box. Twitter politics is extremist politics, and fighting one norm-breaker by creating another is an excellent way for the Democrats to fail again.",

As the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget runs the numbers, about $1.2 trillion of the Trump budget\u2019s future revenue comes is CBO-score bullsh** \u2014 or \u201cphantom revenues,\u201d as the Wall Street Journal delicately puts it.\nAnd even with that CBO-score bullsh**, the budget would add $7.3 trillion to the debt between 2020 and 2029.\nStop spending money you don\u2019t have, dummy.\nThe last time we had a surplus, tax revenue was 18.8 percent of GDP and spending was 17.6 percent of GDP. That was 2001. Taxes were even higher as a share of GDP in the two years before that: 19.2 percent of GDP in 1999 and 20 percent in 2000. I prefer low taxes, but I don\u2019t remember the tail end of the 1990s as an Orwellian dystopia. If the estimates hold, this year, revenues will be about 16.3 percent of GDP and spending will be 21 percent \u2014 with deficits forecast as far as forecasters can see. And that\u2019s while the economy is doing well. Either that tax number moves or that spending number moves \u2014 or we have deficits forever, until the creditors call us on our bullsh**.\nAt which point we will have no choice but to:\nStop spending money you don\u2019t have, dummy.",

Yet universities never fully apprise in-hock students exactly of the dangers of accruing too much debt each semester, of how long it will take them to pay it back, and of the average compensations after graduation that particular university degrees might likely warrant. How ironic that those who so often virtue-signal their concern for consumers offer less disclosure and fewer contractual warnings to their student debtors than used-car buyers receive from dealers.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration is making noises about conditioning federal funding to higher education on protection of free speech for students, guests, and faculty on campuses. It is considering making universities partially responsible for defaulted student loans that they so often push down the throats of 18-year-old students through &ldquo;student aid packages&rdquo; and the hints that the U.S. taxpayer will always cover the bill if a graduate with an expensive but otherwise unmarketable degree cannot pay the federal government back for what he paid out to universities with sizable endowments.</p>\n<p>A reckoning is on the horizon. If universities are overtly political and have one set of standards for left-wing faculty and guests and another for non-progressives, why are they tax-exempt? And why are huge donations to multi-billion-dollar endowments still tax write-offs? Why are there part-time helot faculty who teach the same classes as tenured professors and yet make a fraction of the latter&rsquo;s salary &mdash; in a progressive institution whose elites hector others on our culture&rsquo;s neglect of equality and social justice?</p>\n<p>Oddly, the best reform would simply to be to force universities and colleges to offer the same sort of exit exams as the admission exams they insist on for entering students. In other words, to earn a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, graduating college seniors would be required to taking a national standardized test to ensure minimal competence in verbal and math skills. This would certify that the four- to eight-year undergraduate experience has led to at least minimal knowledge &mdash; much as welders or carpenters must show minimal competency to be licensed or to advance into union apprenticeships. Again, how ironic that the Obama administration once went after for-profit trade schools and colleges on grounds that their job-placement record was wanting, when supposedly nonprofit colleges (which are actually quite profitable for those in their administrative hierarchies) have a dismal record of ensuring that their graduates leave with basic language and computational skills.</p>\n<p>Colleges demand that graduating high-school seniors take the SAT or ACT to prove that particular high-school diplomas ensure minimal competence. How odd again, then, that colleges would never regulate themselves in this way. The public might discover that the current college curriculum is mostly therapeutic and flooded with -studies courses that drown out traditional history, literature, languages, science, and math. College graduates therefore often read, write, argue, and compute in no better fashion than they once did in high school.</p>\n<p>Something in this country went radically wrong in the 1980s and 1990s. We created an entire subversive ideology according to which loud allegiance to &ldquo;progressivism&rdquo; &mdash; decrying class, race, and gender &ldquo;inequality&rdquo; &mdash; excused an institution or industry from bias, exempted it from following the letter and spirit of the U.S. Constitution, and made competency in its mission of educating youth irrelevant. And worse still, so-called progressive egalitarians transformed the idea of an elite college degree from a reflection of wide reading, inductive thinking, and scientific and mathematical literacy into a mere cattle brand, a showy trademark that advertised social-justice virtue and provided entr&eacute;e into the well-paying capitalist rat race.</p>\n<p>Yet once politics serves as such a blanket exemption for institutions, then it&rsquo;s no surprise that the institutions ignore or even normalize fraud, racial and class discrimination, and consumer misinformation.</p>\n<p>The rationale of contemporary higher education is that such progressive angels surely cannot be self-interested devils.</p>",

If universities are overtly political and have one set of standards for left-wing faculty and guests and another for non-progressives, why are they tax-exempt? And why are huge donations to multi-billion-dollar endowments still tax write-offs? Why are there part-time helot faculty who teach the same classes as tenured professors and yet make a fraction of the latter\u2019s salary \u2014 in a progressive institution whose elites hector others on our culture\u2019s neglect of equality and social justice?\nOddly, the best reform would simply to be to force universities and colleges to offer the same sort of exit exams as the admission exams they insist on for entering students. In other words, to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree, graduating college seniors would be required to taking a national standardized test to ensure minimal competence in verbal and math skills. This would certify that the four- to eight-year undergraduate experience has led to at least minimal knowledge \u2014 much as welders or carpenters must show minimal competency to be licensed or to advance into union apprenticeships. Again, how ironic that the Obama administration once went after for-profit trade schools and colleges on grounds that their job-placement record was wanting, when supposedly nonprofit colleges (which are actually quite profitable for those in their administrative hierarchies) have a dismal record of ensuring that their graduates leave with basic language and computational skills.\nColleges demand that graduating high-school seniors take the SAT or ACT to prove that particular high-school diplomas ensure minimal competence. How odd again, then, that colleges would never regulate themselves in this way. The public might discover that the current college curriculum is mostly therapeutic and flooded with -studies courses that drown out traditional history, literature, languages, science, and math. College graduates therefore often read, write, argue, and compute in no better fashion than they once did in high school.\nSomething in this country went radically wrong in the 1980s and 1990s. We created an entire subversive ideology according to which loud allegiance to \u201cprogressivism\u201d \u2014 decrying class, race, and gender \u201cinequality\u201d \u2014 excused an institution or industry from bias, exempted it from following the letter and spirit of the U.S. Constitution, and made competency in its mission of educating youth irrelevant. And worse still, so-called progressive egalitarians transformed the idea of an elite college degree from a reflection of wide reading, inductive thinking, and scientific and mathematical literacy into a mere cattle brand, a showy trademark that advertised social-justice virtue and provided entr\u00e9e into the well-paying capitalist rat race.\nYet once politics serves as such a blanket exemption for institutions, then it\u2019s no surprise that the institutions ignore or even normalize fraud, racial and class discrimination, and consumer misinformation.\nThe rationale of contemporary higher education is that such progressive angels surely cannot be self-interested devils.",

                "html": "<figure><figcaption> Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks at a campaign event in Chicago, Ill., March 3, 2019. (Joshua Lott/Reuters) </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Again, Bernie Sanders is distinguishing himself from his Democratic colleagues on matters of character, confidence, and imagination. The Democratic party has rejected offers from Fox News to host its primary debates. But on Monday night, Sanders did a town hall from Bethlehem, Pa., which sits in one of those now-famous counties that suffered de-industrialization, voted for Barack Obama in 2012, and then went for Donald Trump in 2016. It was a very savvy move. It demonstrated Sanders&rsquo;s verve, a strong dash of political courage, and a presidential willingness to speak to audiences beyond his party&rsquo;s base. Republicans would be foolish to think he&rsquo;s a pushover.</p>\n<p>We should dwell on Sanders&rsquo;s decision to appear on Fox in this format. &ldquo;Your network doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of respect in my world, but I thought it was important,&rdquo; he told hosts Brett Baier and Martha MacCallum of the event. And of course he&rsquo;s right. The media environment is entirely transformed from 20 or 30 years ago. Even the most dedicated news consumers often watch one cable network that matches their political disposition, and then consume news and opinion (and opinionated news) through social-media feeds biased first by their actual social milieu and then by algorithms that feed consumers more of what they already like. Sanders is smart to cross the media aisle.</p>\n<p>He also found ways to speak to his base and a Fox News audience at the same time. When asked by a centrist Democrat about whether the party was drifting too far to the left, Sanders pivoted to giving an answer that would sound good to leftists who want to talk about policy, centrists who want to think of themselves as high-minded and civic, and conservatives as well. &ldquo;If we spend all our time attacking Trump, Democrats are going to lose,&rdquo; he averred. Not profound, but a very politic answer nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Sanders effectively and charmingly exposed the gap between Donald Trump&rsquo;s political rhetoric and the reality of his administration. The tax cuts won&rsquo;t go to the wealthy, Trump promised. In fact, Sanders pointed out, most of them did go to the wealthiest payers. National Review readers know that this was inevitable because the tax burden falls heaviest on those who earn the most. But Sanders still made an effective rhetorical weapon of it. He brought up Trump&rsquo;s campaign promise not to cut Medicare or Medicaid, and the fact that Trump&rsquo;s budgets would do just that.</p>\n<p>Sanders was canny when answering questions on immigration. He emphasized the need for more judges to handle the incredible burst of asylum claims at the border. &ldquo;We need border security, of course. Who argues with that?&rdquo; Sanders said. He was also rather effective on health care. Baier pointed out that 180 million Americans have private insurance that would be canceled by Sanders&rsquo;s plan. Sanders retorted that many Americans see their insurance plans change annually when their employers shop for new plans, or whenever their jobs change. That Republicans have offered nothing to remove the kludgeocracy of administering health insurance through New Deal-era tax loopholes makes the proposed simplicity of Sanders&rsquo;s plan appealing by comparison.</p>\n<p>Sanders was also able to show off his blessedly ornery and old-school personality, which is a winner, I think. Challenged on his status as a 1 percenter with a net worth in the seven figures, Sanders replied, &ldquo;If anyone thinks I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, <em>I&rsquo;m sorry</em>, I&rsquo;m not going to do it.&rdquo; A non-apology that contains an apology.</p>\n<p>Bernie supporters have a lot to be excited about. Their candidate has not only moved his party on ideas, he&rsquo;s transformed himself from a prophetical voice of the left to presidential material. He has a message that is aimed perfectly at the states that Trump won narrowly in 2016 and that a Democrat needs to win back in 2020. His message discipline springs from the fundamental integrity of his convictions. He&rsquo;s formidable.</p>\n<p>And, once again, his appearance on Fox distinguishes him from other Democrats and particularly from Hillary Clinton. Many Republicans who watch Fox News and consume populist media can get the distinct impression that Democrats are just waiting for them to die. That was what was so damaging about Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s &ldquo;basket of deplorables&rdquo; comment and her implication that Trump supporters will have no place in defining American life going forward. Sanders believes in his message so much, he wants to pitch it to you just before you settle in for <em>Tucker Carlson Tonight</em>. That&rsquo;s to his credit.</p>\n<figure><figcaption> <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/author/michael-brendan-dougherty/\">Michael Brendan Dougherty</a> is a senior writer at National Review Online. <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/@michaelbd\"> @michaelbd </a> </figcaption></figure>",

When asked by a centrist Democrat about whether the party was drifting too far to the left, Sanders pivoted to giving an answer that would sound good to leftists who want to talk about policy, centrists who want to think of themselves as high-minded and civic, and conservatives as well. \u201cIf we spend all our time attacking Trump, Democrats are going to lose,\u201d he averred. Not profound, but a very politic answer nonetheless.\nSanders effectively and charmingly exposed the gap between Donald Trump\u2019s political rhetoric and the reality of his administration. The tax cuts won\u2019t go to the wealthy, Trump promised. In fact, Sanders pointed out, most of them did go to the wealthiest payers. National Review readers know that this was inevitable because the tax burden falls heaviest on those who earn the most. But Sanders still made an effective rhetorical weapon of it. He brought up Trump\u2019s campaign promise not to cut Medicare or Medicaid, and the fact that Trump\u2019s budgets would do just that.\nSanders was canny when answering questions on immigration. He emphasized the need for more judges to handle the incredible burst of asylum claims at the border. \u201cWe need border security, of course. Who argues with that?\u201d Sanders said. He was also rather effective on health care. Baier pointed out that 180 million Americans have private insurance that would be canceled by Sanders\u2019s plan. Sanders retorted that many Americans see their insurance plans change annually when their employers shop for new plans, or whenever their jobs change. That Republicans have offered nothing to remove the kludgeocracy of administering health insurance through New Deal-era tax loopholes makes the proposed simplicity of Sanders\u2019s plan appealing by comparison.\nSanders was also able to show off his blessedly ornery and old-school personality, which is a winner, I think. Challenged on his status as a 1 percenter with a net worth in the seven figures, Sanders replied, \u201cIf anyone thinks I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d A non-apology that contains an apology.\nBernie supporters have a lot to be excited about. Their candidate has not only moved his party on ideas, he\u2019s transformed himself from a prophetical voice of the left to presidential material. He has a message that is aimed perfectly at the states that Trump won narrowly in 2016 and that a Democrat needs to win back in 2020. His message discipline springs from the fundamental integrity of his convictions. He\u2019s formidable.\nAnd, once again, his appearance on Fox distinguishes him from other Democrats and particularly from Hillary Clinton. Many Republicans who watch Fox News and consume populist media can get the distinct impression that Democrats are just waiting for them to die. That was what was so damaging about Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d comment and her implication that Trump supporters will have no place in defining American life going forward. Sanders believes in his message so much, he wants to pitch it to you just before you settle in for Tucker Carlson Tonight. That\u2019s to his credit.",

(John Gress/Reuters) </figcaption></figure>\n<p>He has zero appeal to religious conservatives because he holds to the Democratic party line on the right to kill viable, living unborn babies.</p>\n<p>With every passing day, it seems we see yet another piece about South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg&rsquo;s progressive Christianity. His faith is going to shake the race. He&rsquo;s going to challenge the GOP monopoly on &ldquo;God talk.&rdquo; Here, for example, is the opening paragraph of an <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/religious-conservatives-grapple-how-respond-buttigieg-n994691\">NBC News analysis</a> posted yesterday afternoon:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Religious conservatives who have long been a reliable voting bloc for Republicans are grappling with a new challenge in Pete Buttigieg: how to respond to a Democratic presidential candidate who is leaning into the discussion about faith and its role in political life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll agree that there are religious conservatives who are &ldquo;grappling&rdquo; with a challenge from Buttigieg, but that challenge is theological and cultural, not political. Buttigieg&rsquo;s religious arguments have triggered important online debates about the differences between mainline and Evangelical Christianity, about when religious teachings should influence public policy, and about how to interpret the history of the gay-marriage debate.</p>\n<p>But religious conservatives are <em>not</em> grappling with the key political question &mdash; whether any meaningful number of Evangelicals or conservative Catholics would cross the aisle to cast a ballot for Mayor Pete. The reason is simple. Buttigieg is a pro-choice extremist, and no pro-choice extremist will ever meaningfully compete for the conservative Christian vote.</p>\n<p>In fact, in at least one key way, Buttigieg&rsquo;s record on abortion is even worse than that of his Democratic peers. He is of course in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewschmitz/status/1112162571585490944\">lockstep agreement</a> with them on support for late-term abortion, and he made that clear last month on <em>Morning Joe</em>:</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"> <p>.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeteButtigieg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PeteButtigieg</a> explains his support for late-term abortion bills in New York and Virginia: </p> <p>&rdquo;When we&rsquo;re talking about some of those situations covered by that law &hellip; the involvement of a male government official like me is not helpful.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://t.co/6lQrLLhwhW\">pic.twitter.com/6lQrLLhwhW</a></p> <p>&mdash; Matthew Schmitz (@matthewschmitz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewschmitz/status/1112162571585490944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 31, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>But he&rsquo;s done what many of them have not &mdash; he&rsquo;s actually blocked a crisis-pregnancy center from opening at its chosen location. He not only supports abortion rights, he&rsquo;s taken action against law-abiding Americans who merely wanted to make the case for life.</p>\n<p>Last April, Buttigieg <a href=\"https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/south-bend-mayor-pete-buttigieg-vetoes-anti-abortion-group-s/article_0b08950f-cd02-5b15-93cf-ff3a29fa2515.html\">vetoed a rezoning plan</a> that would have permitted a crisis-pregnancy center to open next door to a proposed abortion clinic. In his statement justifying the veto, Buttigieg said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be responsible to situate two groups, literally right next to each other, in a neighborhood, that have diametrically opposed views on the most divisive social issue of our time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And so, given the conflict, he chose to privilege the abortion clinic&rsquo;s location over the pregnancy center. Thankfully, the center <a href=\"https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/anti-abortion-group-finds-new-site-across-street-from-proposed/article_eeb7f480-38cf-56a1-8bf3-f19e859954be.html\">found a new location</a> across the street from the proposed clinic &mdash; a location that didn&rsquo;t require a rezoning vote. But that does not excuse or justify Buttigieg&rsquo;s veto. He favored abortion rights over pro-life speech, and he likely violated the Constitution in doing so.</p>\n<p>While Buttigieg, to his credit, did not demonize his opponents in the South Bend dispute ( &ldquo;Many people that I respect and admire and appreciate have very passionate and very opposite views on what is the right thing to do,&rdquo; he said of the dispute), actions speak louder than words. And this action echoes a dangerous Democratic trend in pro-choice governance: the attack against pro-life pregnancy clinics.</p>\n<p>Across the United States, progressive legislatures have passed laws aimed at crisis-pregnancy centers, including a California law <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/national-institute-family-life-advocates-v-becerra/\">the Supreme Court struck down</a> just last summer. Buttigieg hasn&rsquo;t gone as far as California, which actually required pro-life pregnancy centers to promote state-funded free and low-cost abortions. But he had an opportunity to fully respect the constitutional rights of his pro-life opponents, and he chose not to do so.</p>\n<p>Many young Evangelicals, including young Evangelical activists, are divided over matters such as same-sex marriage. Some believe <em>Obergefell v. Hodges </em>was wrongly decided, others support legal recognition of same-sex marriage so long as the state doesn&rsquo;t interfere with the church&rsquo;s ability to define marriage according to the historic doctrines of the Christian faith. Others support same-sex marriage constitutionally <em>and</em> theologically.</p>\n<p>These same young Christians are often appalled that their older brothers and sisters in the faith have so easily overlooked Donald Trump&rsquo;s multitude of sins. But they will not support politicians who support legal protections for late-term abortions. They won&rsquo;t. The will not support politicians who don&rsquo;t go beyond &ldquo;respecting&rdquo; pro-life Americans to also protecting their rights to free speech with the same vigor that they protect the First Amendment rights of pro-choice Americans.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2016, I had hours of conversations with anguished Evangelical activists. They did not like Donald Trump. They could not believe the hypocrisy of some pastors defending a man whom they&rsquo;d condemn if he had a &ldquo;D&rdquo; by his name. But they also could not believe that the Democrats wouldn&rsquo;t compromise at all on abortion, not even in the third trimester. More than one person told me of this issue, &ldquo;If only they&rsquo;d moderate a little, I&rsquo;d consider crossing the aisle. But they won&rsquo;t, so I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Those words will still be true in 2020, and while Buttigieg&rsquo;s lack of overt hostility to pro-life citizens is welcome &mdash; and conversations about America&rsquo;s competing Christian world views are interesting &mdash; he has <em>zero</em> appeal to religious conservatives so long as he holds to the Democratic party line on the right of a woman to hire a doctor to kill a viable, living unborn baby. There is nothing to &ldquo;grapple&rdquo; with. There is no &ldquo;challenge.&rdquo; There are lines that Christian conservatives must not &mdash; and will not &mdash; cross.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.

Buttigieg is a pro-choice extremist, and no pro-choice extremist will ever meaningfully compete for the conservative Christian vote.\nIn fact, in at least one key way, Buttigieg\u2019s record on abortion is even worse than that of his Democratic peers. He is of course in lockstep agreement with them on support for late-term abortion, and he made that clear last month on Morning Joe:\n.@PeteButtigieg explains his support for late-term abortion bills in New York and Virginia:\n\u201dWhen we\u2019re talking about some of those situations covered by that law \u2026 the involvement of a male government official like me is not helpful.\u201d pic.twitter.com/6lQrLLhwhW\n\u2014 Matthew Schmitz (@matthewschmitz) March 31, 2019\nBut he\u2019s done what many of them have not \u2014 he\u2019s actually blocked a crisis-pregnancy center from opening at its chosen location. He not only supports abortion rights, he\u2019s taken action against law-abiding Americans who merely wanted to make the case for life.\nLast April, Buttigieg vetoed a rezoning plan that would have permitted a crisis-pregnancy center to open next door to a proposed abortion clinic. In his statement justifying the veto, Buttigieg said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be responsible to situate two groups, literally right next to each other, in a neighborhood, that have diametrically opposed views on the most divisive social issue of our time.\u201d\nAnd so, given the conflict, he chose to privilege the abortion clinic\u2019s location over the pregnancy center. Thankfully, the center found a new location across the street from the proposed clinic \u2014 a location that didn\u2019t require a rezoning vote. But that does not excuse or justify Buttigieg\u2019s veto. He favored abortion rights over pro-life speech, and he likely violated the Constitution in doing so.\nWhile Buttigieg, to his credit, did not demonize his opponents in the South Bend dispute ( \u201cMany people that I respect and admire and appreciate have very passionate and very opposite views on what is the right thing to do,\u201d he said of the dispute), actions speak louder than words. And this action echoes a dangerous Democratic trend in pro-choice governance: the attack against pro-life pregnancy clinics.\nAcross the United States, progressive legislatures have passed laws aimed at crisis-pregnancy centers, including a California law the Supreme Court struck down just last summer. Buttigieg hasn\u2019t gone as far as California, which actually required pro-life pregnancy centers to promote state-funded free and low-cost abortions. But he had an opportunity to fully respect the constitutional rights of his pro-life opponents, and he chose not to do so.\nMany young Evangelicals, including young Evangelical activists, are divided over matters such as same-sex marriage. Some believe Obergefell v. Hodges was wrongly decided, others support legal recognition of same-sex marriage so long as the state doesn\u2019t interfere with the church\u2019s ability to define marriage according to the historic doctrines of the Christian faith. Others support same-sex marriage constitutionally and theologically.\nThese same young Christians are often appalled that their older brothers and sisters in the faith have so easily overlooked Donald Trump\u2019s multitude of sins. But they will not support politicians who support legal protections for late-term abortions. They won\u2019t. The will not support politicians who don\u2019t go beyond \u201crespecting\u201d pro-life Americans to also protecting their rights to free speech with the same vigor that they protect the First Amendment rights of pro-choice Americans.\nIn the summer of 2016, I had hours of conversations with anguished Evangelical activists. They did not like Donald Trump. They could not believe the hypocrisy of some pastors defending a man whom they\u2019d condemn if he had a \u201cD\u201d by his name. But they also could not believe that the Democrats wouldn\u2019t compromise at all on abortion, not even in the third trimester. More than one person told me of this issue, \u201cIf only they\u2019d moderate a little, I\u2019d consider crossing the aisle. But they won\u2019t, so I can\u2019t.\u201d\nThose words will still be true in 2020, and while Buttigieg\u2019s lack of overt hostility to pro-life citizens is welcome \u2014 and conversations about America\u2019s competing Christian world views are interesting \u2014 he has zero appeal to religious conservatives so long as he holds to the Democratic party line on the right of a woman to hire a doctor to kill a viable, living unborn baby. There is nothing to \u201cgrapple\u201d with. There is no \u201cchallenge.\u201d There are lines that Christian conservatives must not \u2014 and will not \u2014 cross.\nIf you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.

                "html": "<figure><figcaption> President Barack Obama in 2016 (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Americans voted for Barack Obama in 2008 despite, not because of, his most partisan voting record in the Senate. They were once willing to look past his earlier dubious associations with abject anti-Semites such as the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, former terrorists like Bill Ayers, and unhinged characters such as Father Pfleger. They also averted their eyes from Obama&rsquo;s often quite offensive commentary, in his autobiography and during the 2008 campaign (e.g., &ldquo;typical white person&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>they</em> cling to&hellip;&rdquo; speech).</p>\n<p>Instead, voters were tired of the Iraq War (which was over for all practical purposes by the time of the November 2008 election).</p>\n<p>They were, of course, terrified by the September 2008 financial meltdown (which had been mostly stabilized four months later by the time of the inauguration) and irate at the kid-gloves treatment accorded often conniving banks and investors.</p>\n<p>They were convinced that Obama might be healing and transformative as the first African-American president, supposedly only slightly to the left of a far steadier and more qualified Condoleezza Rice or Colin Powell. And half the Democrats were already becoming sick of Hillary Clinton once they became reacquainted with her on the 2008 primary-campaign trail.</p>\n<p>As is typical of American politics, voters in 2008 also wanted to change the party in power after it had been in the lead for eight years, and the lame-duck president fell out of favor. Voters certainly were underwhelmed by an uninspiring, herky-jerky, mostly incompetent John McCain campaign, notable for his &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not who we are&rdquo; comments and his willingness to &ldquo;lose nobly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Such was the na&iuml;ve dream.</p>\n<p>The reality by 2013 was that voters got an increasing hard-core liberal-progressive revolution that, after Obama&rsquo;s 2012 reelection, increasingly polarized America over the reach of the federal government, immigration, and race. Scandals at the DOJ and IRS were often political in nature. By summer 2016, the Obama administration had weaponized the intelligence agencies and his own justice department to such a degree that unleashed bureaucrats and appointees actively sought to intervene in a presidential campaign to undermine the opposition candidate and to lay the foundation for sabotaging the incoming president&rsquo;s transition and administration.</p>\n<p>An overregulated economy stagnated, requiring ever more federal intervention and borrowing. Students on campuses lost constitutional protections, especially under the First and Fifth Amendments, as universities finalized their long transformation into indoctrination centers. Obama recalibrated American foreign policy in neutralist fashion, and in a way that made Egypt, Israel, and Saudi Arabia more suspect than Iran, Turkey, or Cuba.</p>\n<p>Culturally, diversity replaced affirmative action, on the principle that formerly documented grievances or class status no longer mattered, at least compared with skin color. The real divide was now between a non-white, far greater collective that harbored purported grievances against a reconstituted and much smaller white majority and its &ldquo;privilege and &ldquo;supremacy.&rdquo; When feminists and gays were included in the diverse intersectional bloc of Asians, Latinos, blacks, and immigrants, a supposed new majority of &ldquo;woke&rdquo; Americans now would have electoral control over a culpable and soon to become irrelevant minority. The &ldquo;content of our character&rdquo; and all that became &ldquo;inoperative.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>All this was largely the legacy of an otherwise mostly unsuccessful Obama administration whose record was one of massive debt, an ossified economy, decreased sovereignty, increased ethnic and racial tensions, and a confused foreign policy perceived abroad as apologetic and contrite, and therefore useful to rivals and enemies.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Socialist-Progressive Takeover</em></strong></p>\n<p>Yet Obama had hit on something in his move to the hard left. After he left office, unapologetic leftists were less coy (the old smear of &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; was now a term of endearment) and began to extinguish what little was left of Bill Clinton&rsquo;s old, occasionally moderate Democratic party.</p>\n<p>The reelection of Obama had convinced progressives that he had discovered electoral magic: record voter registration, turnout, and block voting of &ldquo;minorities&rdquo; that could overcome the old Perot, Reagan Democrat, silent majority, and tea-party dinosaurs in the critical swing states. This chemistry, they thought, would be inherently transferrable even to multimillionaire white establishmentarians like Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden (<em>but only if</em> they were reeducated and thus made the necessary confessionals about their own white privilege and shared disdain for &ldquo;deplorables&rdquo; and &ldquo;the dregs of society&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>Suddenly, everything seemed possible as woke activists, &agrave; la French Revolution, accelerated the possible into the already pass&eacute;.</p>\n<p>In just a few years, mere acceptance (rather than endorsement) of gay marriage was veritable homophobia. Assimilation and integration were seen as tantamount to cultural appropriation and imperialism. Conservation and market-based encouragement of alternative energy were the appeasement of &ldquo;climate deniers&rdquo; and showed a cowardly reluctance to go the full green mile and eventually ban the internal combustion engine. The Kavanaugh hearing, the Covington-kids fiasco, and the Jussie Smollett farce made clear that the Left was no longer liberal but hard-left and fact-free.</p>\n<p>Secure borders and deportation of illegal aliens who had committed crimes were themselves humanitarian &ldquo;crimes.&rdquo; Building the wall went to stopping the wall to promoting the tearing down of the wall. The notions of affirmation action and disparate impact became Sixties&rsquo; relics, when &ldquo;reparation&rdquo; was the real goal. Prior street-theater groups such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter seemed timid anachronisms compared with Antifa and its masked hoodlums who torched and beat up anything in their path.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Legal but rare&rdquo; abortion became a sellout position, given that any woman had a right to partial-birth abortion and even infanticide if she so chose. A dream of a 50 percent income-tax rate on top incomes went to talk of 70 percent then to 90 percent and then to a wealth tax as just deserts. To enlarge the electorate, illegal aliens should vote first in local elections, but then why not everywhere? Sixteen-years olds could too, and so why not ex-felons as well? About a $1.5 trillion in student debt should be forgiven &mdash; but then tuition should be free for all (as should Medicare).</p>\n<p>The appearance and success of the polarizing Donald Trump supercharged the ongoing progressive revolution. The rallying cries of &ldquo;collusion,&rdquo; &ldquo;treason,&rdquo; and the new &ldquo;Manchurian candidate&rdquo; won over any holdout Democrat and seduced the emasculated Never Trump right into becoming useful colluding idiots. The 2018 Democratic midterm victory in the House was not seen in historical context: Trump in fact had fared much better in both the House and Senate in his first midterm than had either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama at that point in their presidencies, both of whom were easily reelected, while mostly centrist candidates had given the Democrats the new House majority.</p>\n<p>By spring 2019, we were light years beyond the revolution&rsquo;s beginning in summer 2008 &mdash; and heading into hard-socialist territory and beyond.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the once edgy community-organizing Obama himself had become a tragicomical figure. He spent a bit of his post-presidency warning against a &ldquo;circular firing squad&rdquo; of Democratic cannibalism but otherwise was hell-bent on becoming worth $100 million in &ldquo;I built that fashion&rdquo;&mdash;and was never again heard uttering another &ldquo;I do think at a certain point you&rsquo;ve made enough money&rdquo; sermon.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Socialism and Beyond</em></strong></p>\n<p>Conventional wisdom would warn Democrats that their surrender to pied pipers such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Al Sharpton, Linda Sasour, and other assorted fakers, con artists, anti-Semites, and street actors would lead them all over the proverbial George McGovern and Walter Mondale cliff into the abyss. But such caution is unlikely for a variety of reasons.</p>\n<p>One, Democratic candidates now sound a lot more like Bernie Sanders than he ever sounded like them. The new socialists believe that they have altered the nature of the electorate and the manner in which elections are conducted, and that they will continue to do so at an accelerating pace.</p>\n<p>Preemptory charges of &ldquo;voter suppression&rdquo; have made required prior registration and voter IDs veritable racist crimes, as voter harvesting and fluid same-day registration and voting are the hallmarks of the future, even as open borders change the demography of the nation. Youth, not experience or tenure, is the requisite for progressive revolution, as brontosauruses like Diane Feinstein and Chuck Schumer struggle to sputter a few shrill socialist platitudes to maintain minimal relevance. Anti-Semitism is not called out by Democrats, because party leaders fear that Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, and Tlaib are not aberrations but now represent 51 percent of the new Democratic party on both Israel and American Jewry.</p>\n<p>Two, few leftist revolutionary cycles ever halt in mid course, whether in 1789 France, 1917 Russia, 1946 China, or 1960 Cuba. The philosophy is always that today&rsquo;s radical is yesterday&rsquo;s sell-out to be replaced by tomorrow&rsquo;s genuine far harder leftist &mdash; until the limits of reality are reached and the movement either implodes or leads to an authoritarian Napoleon, Lenin, Mao, or Fidel.</p>\n<p>The current socialist trajectory is divorced from reality, whether reality mean the critical role of fossil fuels in maintaining civilization, or the historical record of tribalism destroying nations from Rwanda to the Balkans, or the usual story of soft socialism inevitably turning hard and ending in the mass poverty of a North Korea, Venezuela, or Cuba.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The End Game</em></strong></p>\n<p>Socialists and hard progressives believe that they already have won about three-fifths of America, defined not by population, polls, or political office, but by cultural clout. They assume that such control will inevitably end in final victory in the Congress and presidency, the same way that that there&rsquo;s no longer a Republican party to speak of in California and not a single statewide officeholder who is not a Democrat. Seven of 53 House seats are Republican in the California of Ronald Reagan and Pete Wilson.</p>\n<p>Entertainment and Hollywood are mostly all left-wing and missionary in their progressive zeal. The network news, PBS, NPR, CNN, and MSNBC outnumber talk radio and Fox News.</p>\n<p>Most of the major newspapers are progressive. Silicon Valley is harder left still and more audacious in baking ideology into its products from Twitter and Facebook, which censor conservatives, to Google, with its progressive bias in formatting and searches.</p>\n<p>The biggest foundations that most fund activists and academics are mostly left-wing. No one believes that the campuses are balanced or even disinterested. Most academics believe that they can be legitimately biased leftward to balance the supposed prejudices of the family, community, and church &mdash; noisome cargo that too many of their na&iuml;ve students bring with them on arrival, which is why they need &ldquo;cleansing&rdquo; and &ldquo;awakening.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sports events and reporting are liberal and increasingly avenues to peddle political messages. Corporate America tries to emulate popular culture and thus must adopt left-wing tropes, so it&rsquo;s trigger-happy in its readiness to shoot down conservatives who are deemed hostile to our shared fated progressive future.</p>\n<p>What we are seeing in the Democratic party&rsquo;s movement to the hard left is not the beginning but the end of a long march. Socialists and progressives believe that control of the Congress, the presidency, and courts is the final missing tessera from their already expansive socialist mosaic.</p>\n<p>They believe that the future is theirs. They no longer need to apologize for pushing government-sanctioned redistribution. And with an administrative state that nearly pulled off a coup in the past two years, with 21 trillion dollars in national debt and the courts as de facto progressive legislators, and with an open 2,000-mile border, they may well be right.</p>\n<figure><figcaption> NRO contributor <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/author/victor-davis-hanson/\">Victor Davis Hanson</a> is the Martin and Illie Anderson Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author, most recently, of <em>The Case for Trump</em>. <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/vdhanson\"> @vdhanson </a> </figcaption></figure>",

                "text": "Americans voted for Barack Obama in 2008 despite, not because of, his most partisan voting record in the Senate. They were once willing to look past his earlier dubious associations with abject anti-Semites such as the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, former terrorists like Bill Ayers, and unhinged characters such as Father Pfleger. They also averted their eyes from Obama\u2019s often quite offensive commentary, in his autobiography and during the 2008 campaign (e.g., \u201ctypical white person\u201d and \u201cthey cling to\u2026\u201d speech).\nInstead, voters were tired of the Iraq War (which was over for all practical purposes by the time of the November 2008 election).\nThey were, of course, terrified by the September 2008 financial meltdown (which had been mostly stabilized four months later by the time of the inauguration) and irate at the kid-gloves treatment accorded often conniving banks and investors.\nThey were convinced that Obama might be healing and transformative as the first African-American president, supposedly only slightly to the left of a far steadier and more qualified Condoleezza Rice or Colin Powell. And half the Democrats were already becoming sick of Hillary Clinton once they became reacquainted with her on the 2008 primary-campaign trail.\nAs is typical of American politics, voters in 2008 also wanted to change the party in power after it had been in the lead for eight years, and the lame-duck president fell out of favor. Voters certainly were underwhelmed by an uninspiring, herky-jerky, mostly incompetent John McCain campaign, notable for his \u201cthat\u2019s not who we are\u201d comments and his willingness to \u201close nobly.\u201d\nSuch was the na\u00efve dream.\nThe reality by 2013 was that voters got an increasing hard-core liberal-progressive revolution that, after Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection, increasingly polarized America over the reach of the federal government, immigration, and race. Scandals at the DOJ and IRS were often political in nature. By summer 2016, the Obama administration had weaponized the intelligence agencies and his own justice department to such a degree that unleashed bureaucrats and appointees actively sought to intervene in a presidential campaign to undermine the opposition candidate and to lay the foundation for sabotaging the incoming president\u2019s transition and administration.\nAn overregulated economy stagnated, requiring ever more federal intervention and borrowing. Students on campuses lost constitutional protections, especially under the First and Fifth Amendments, as universities finalized their long transformation into indoctrination centers. Obama recalibrated American foreign policy in neutralist fashion, and in a way that made Egypt, Israel, and Saudi Arabia more suspect than Iran, Turkey, or Cuba.\nCulturally, diversity replaced affirmative action, on the principle that formerly documented grievances or class status no longer mattered, at least compared with skin color. The real divide was now between a non-white, far greater collective that harbored purported grievances against a reconstituted and much smaller white majority and its \u201cprivilege and \u201csupremacy.\u201d When feminists and gays were included in the diverse intersectional bloc of Asians, Latinos, blacks, and immigrants, a supposed new majority of \u201cwoke\u201d Americans now would have electoral control over a culpable and soon to become irrelevant minority. The \u201ccontent of our character\u201d and all that became \u201cinoperative.\u201d\nAll this was largely the legacy of an otherwise mostly unsuccessful Obama administration whose record was one of massive debt, an ossified economy, decreased sovereignty, increased ethnic and racial tensions, and a confused foreign policy perceived abroad as apologetic and contrite, and therefore useful to rivals and enemies.\nThe Socialist-Progressive Takeover\nYet Obama had hit on something in his move to the hard left. After he left office, unapologetic leftists were less coy (the old smear of \u201csocialist\u201d was now a term of endearment) and began to extinguish what little was left of Bill Clinton\u2019s old, occasionally moderate Democratic party.\nThe reelection of Obama had convinced progressives that he had discovered electoral magic: record voter registration, turnout, and block voting of \u201cminorities\u201d that could overcome the old Perot, Reagan Democrat, silent majority, and tea-party dinosaurs in the critical swing states. This chemistry, they thought, would be inherently transferrable even to multimillionaire white establishmentarians like Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden (but only if they were reeducated and thus made the necessary confessionals about their own white privilege and shared disdain for \u201cdeplorables\u201d and \u201cthe dregs of society\u201d).\nSuddenly, everything seemed possible as woke activists, \u00e0 la French Revolution, accelerated the possible into the already pass\u00e9.\nIn just a few years, mere acceptance (rather than endorsement) of gay marriage was veritable homophobia. Assimilation and integration were seen as tantamount to cultural appropriation and imperialism. Conservation and market-based encouragement of alternative energy were the appeasement of \u201cclimate deniers\u201d and showed a cowardly reluctance to go the full green mile and eventually ban the internal combustion engine. The Kavanaugh hearing, the Covington-kids fiasco, and the Jussie Smollett farce made clear that the Left was no longer liberal but hard-left and fact-free.\nSecure borders and deportation of illegal aliens who had committed crimes were themselves humanitarian \u201ccrimes.\u201d Building the wall went to stopping the wall to promoting the tearing down of the wall. The notions of affirmation action and disparate impact became Sixties\u2019 relics, when \u201creparation\u201d was the real goal. Prior street-theater groups such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter seemed timid anachronisms compared with Antifa and its masked hoodlums who torched and beat up anything in their path.\n\u201cLegal but rare\u201d abortion became a sellout position, given that any woman had a right to partial-birth abortion and even infanticide if she so chose. A dream of a 50 percent income-tax rate on top incomes went to talk of 70 percent then to 90 percent and then to a wealth tax as just deserts. To enlarge the electorate, illegal aliens should vote first in local elections, but then why not everywhere? Sixteen-years olds could too, and so why not ex-felons as well? About a $1.5 trillion in student debt should be forgiven \u2014 but then tuition should be free for all (as should Medicare).\nThe appearance and success of the polarizing Donald Trump supercharged the ongoing progressive revolution. The rallying cries of \u201ccollusion,\u201d \u201ctreason,\u201d and the new \u201cManchurian candidate\u201d won over any holdout Democrat and seduced the emasculated Never Trump right into becoming useful colluding idiots. The 2018 Democratic midterm victory in the House was not seen in historical context: Trump in fact had fared much better in both the House and Senate in his first midterm than had either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama at that point in their presidencies, both of whom were easily reelected, while mostly centrist candidates had given the Democrats the new House majority.\nBy spring 2019, we were light years beyond the revolution\u2019s beginning in summer 2008 \u2014 and heading into hard-socialist territory and beyond.\nIndeed, the once edgy community-organizing Obama himself had become a tragicomical figure. He spent a bit of his post-presidency warning against a \u201ccircular firing squad\u201d of Democratic cannibalism but otherwise was hell-bent on becoming worth $100 million in \u201cI built that fashion\u201d\u2014and was never again heard uttering another \u201cI do think at a certain point you\u2019ve made enough money\u201d sermon.\nSocialism and Beyond\nConventional wisdom would warn Democrats that their surrender to pied pipers such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Al Sharpton, Linda Sasour, and other assorted fakers, con artists, anti-Semites, and street actors would lead them all over the proverbial George McGovern and Walter Mondale cliff into the abyss. But such caution is unlikely for a variety of reasons.\nOne, Democratic candidates now sound a lot more like Bernie Sanders than he ever sounded like them. The new socialists believe that they have altered the nature of the electorate and the manner in which elections are conducted, and that they will continue to do so at an accelerating pace.\nPreemptory charges of \u201cvoter suppression\u201d have made required prior registration and voter IDs veritable racist crimes, as voter harvesting and fluid same-day registration and voting are the hallmarks of the future, even as open borders change the demography of the nation. Youth, not experience or tenure, is the requisite for progressive revolution, as brontosauruses like Diane Feinstein and Chuck Schumer struggle to sputter a few shrill socialist platitudes to maintain minimal relevance. Anti-Semitism is not called out by Democrats, because party leaders fear that Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, and Tlaib are not aberrations but now represent 51 percent of the new Democratic party on both Israel and American Jewry.\nTwo, few leftist revolutionary cycles ever halt in mid course, whether in 1789 France, 1917 Russia, 1946 China, or 1960 Cuba. The philosophy is always that today\u2019s radical is yesterday\u2019s sell-out to be replaced by tomorrow\u2019s genuine far harder leftist \u2014 until the limits of reality are reached and the movement either implodes or leads to an authoritarian Napoleon, Lenin, Mao, or Fidel.\nThe current socialist trajectory is divorced from reality, whether reality mean the critical role of fossil fuels in maintaining civilization, or the historical record of tribalism destroying nations from Rwanda to the Balkans, or the usual story of soft socialism inevitably turning hard and ending in the mass poverty of a North Korea, Venezuela, or Cuba.\nThe End Game\nSocialists and hard progressives believe that they already have won about three-fifths of America, defined not by population, polls, or political office, but by cultural clout. They assume that such control will inevitably end in final victory in the Congress and presidency, the same way that that there\u2019s no longer a Republican party to speak of in California and not a single statewide officeholder who is not a Democrat. Seven of 53 House seats are Republican in the California of Ronald Reagan and Pete Wilson.\nEntertainment and Hollywood are mostly all left-wing and missionary in their progressive zeal. The network news, PBS, NPR, CNN, and MSNBC outnumber talk radio and Fox News.\nMost of the major newspapers are progressive. Silicon Valley is harder left still and more audacious in baking ideology into its products from Twitter and Facebook, which censor conservatives, to Google, with its progressive bias in formatting and searches.\nThe biggest foundations that most fund activists and academics are mostly left-wing. No one believes that the campuses are balanced or even disinterested. Most academics believe that they can be legitimately biased leftward to balance the supposed prejudices of the family, community, and church \u2014 noisome cargo that too many of their na\u00efve students bring with them on arrival, which is why they need \u201ccleansing\u201d and \u201cawakening.\u201d\nSports events and reporting are liberal and increasingly avenues to peddle political messages. Corporate America tries to emulate popular culture and thus must adopt left-wing tropes, so it\u2019s trigger-happy in its readiness to shoot down conservatives who are deemed hostile to our shared fated progressive future.\nWhat we are seeing in the Democratic party\u2019s movement to the hard left is not the beginning but the end of a long march. Socialists and progressives believe that control of the Congress, the presidency, and courts is the final missing tessera from their already expansive socialist mosaic.\nThey believe that the future is theirs. They no longer need to apologize for pushing government-sanctioned redistribution. And with an administrative state that nearly pulled off a coup in the past two years, with 21 trillion dollars in national debt and the courts as de facto progressive legislators, and with an open 2,000-mile border, they may well be right.",

A white supremacist killed at least 50 people as they prayed in two mosques.</p>\n<p>Psychiatrists and spiritual leaders doled out advice on self-care and how to help young Muslims work through this moment.</p>\n<p>&quot;The concern for all of us who are working in the mental health field and in the community is 'What is going to be the long-term impact of this persistent exposure to trauma that our kids are facing right now?' &quot; said Dr. Farha Abbasi, a psychiatrist at Michigan State University.</p>\n<p>That trauma didn't start on Friday.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., while many young Muslims wept over the loss of life and the hate that drove the killings, they said they weren't surprised. They're a generation that has been raised on a constant barrage of anti-Muslim rhetoric since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.</p>\n<p>For most of their lives, if not all of their lives, the U.S. has been at war in Afghanistan and Iraq; elected officials from across the spectrum have questioned their patriotism and their loyalties. Meanwhile, mass violence has become almost commonplace, with schools across the United States holding mass-shooting drills for children and, in the past few years, <a href=\"http://www.aaiusa.org/hate_crimes_continue_to_surge_in_america\">rising numbers of hate crimes </a>against American Muslims and other minorities.</p>\n<p>&quot;Every given day there are more Muslims dying, either by these terrorists, in the name of terrorism or in the war against terrorism. But how the trauma is being internalized is what concerns me,&quot; Abbasi said. Because Muslim life, she said, can feel like it's worthless to others.</p>\n<p>&quot;We already know that trauma can be very disruptive. It's like your story is cut off. Suddenly it takes away your sense of safety, your sense of predictability, but it can also impact your ability to trust, relate, connect, and you feel very isolated and disconnected.&quot;</p>\n<p>Abbasi points to statistics that show young Muslims are feeling more alienated. Muslim parents <a href=\"https://www.ispu.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AMP-2017-Key-Findings.pdf\">report bullying in K-12 school</a> at nearly double the rate of Jewish kids and at more than double and triple the rates of Protestant and Catholic school-age children, respectively. In some cases that bullying is coming from teachers. A <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/dataset/2017-survey-of-u-s-muslims/\">survey</a> from the Pew Research Center found that about two-thirds of Muslims don't think other Americans see them as mainstream.</p>\n<p>&quot;Post-9/11 there is a more concerted effort to demonize Muslims, to make us the other, sort of the foreign threat and the enemy,&quot; said Kameelah Mu'Min Rashad. She's the founder of the <a href=\"https://www.muslimwellness.com\">Muslim Wellness Foundation</a>, which promotes healing and emotional health in American Muslim communities.</p>\n<p>That message is what the 15- to 20-year-olds she counsels have heard their whole lives.</p>\n<p>&quot;Unfortunately for them it feels commonplace,&quot; she said. &quot;From extremely horrific events like what we saw happened in New Zealand in Christchurch to daily microaggressions and invalidations of their identity. And so I am very proud of how resilient American Muslim youth are. And I'm also very concerned about the onslaught and sort of daily erosion of their humanity.&quot;</p>\n<p>Every day these young people are asked to prove their worth and their humanity, she said. A vast swath of American Muslim adults are young: <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/demographic-portrait-of-muslim-americans/\">At least 35 percent </a>are between the ages of 18 and 29. Many have multiple identities that are marginalized and threatened by white supremacy &mdash; black Muslims, queer Muslims, undocumented Muslims.</p>\n<p><strong>Islamophobia is 'always present'</strong></p>\n<p>It's all too familiar for Nayab Khan. She's a 22-year-old student at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>&quot;I've only lived in a period where Islamophobia, anti-Muslim rhetoric, is always present, everywhere I go,&quot; she said. &quot;Whether that be the eighth grade, being called a terrorist for the first time, or whether that be the shooting a few days ago.&quot;</p>\n<p>The daily aggressions have shaped her identity. She goes to the corner store near her apartment, and someone calls out, 'Go back to your country'; she gets on the train, a woman yells at her. It's part of being visibly Muslim. She's a Pakistani American who wears the religious head covering, the hijab.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's very exhausting and very laborious to always, one, have to constantly be explaining yourself,&quot; she said. &quot;And two, attempting to normalize it, when in reality I'm Muslim and I'm different and that's who I am.&quot;</p>\n<p>So now Khan is active on campus with the Muslim Student Association. She organized a vigil after the Christchurch attacks, and she's building coalitions with other groups who combat white supremacy, xenophobia and racism.</p>\n<p>Seventeen-year-old Noor Bowman of Philadelphia says the anti-Muslim stuff barely registers with her anymore.</p>\n<p>&quot;As a young person growing up, they shape your experience and the way you see the world around you,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm so used to it that when people mention it, I'm like, 'Oh, I do experience microaggressions and different things.' But unfortunately it's become a part of everyday life.&quot;</p>\n<p>Things like people calling her derogatory names for an Arab &mdash; she's African-American. Telling her to go back to her country &mdash; she's from Philadelphia.

                "text": "Over the weekend, Muslim mental health professionals quickly pulled together a webinar to share advice on how to deal with trauma after the New Zealand terrorist attacks on Friday. A white supremacist killed at least 50 people as they prayed in two mosques.\nPsychiatrists and spiritual leaders doled out advice on self-care and how to help young Muslims work through this moment.\n\"The concern for all of us who are working in the mental health field and in the community is 'What is going to be the long-term impact of this persistent exposure to trauma that our kids are facing right now?' \" said Dr. Farha Abbasi, a psychiatrist at Michigan State University.\nThat trauma didn't start on Friday.\nIn the U.S., while many young Muslims wept over the loss of life and the hate that drove the killings, they said they weren't surprised. They're a generation that has been raised on a constant barrage of anti-Muslim rhetoric since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nFor most of their lives, if not all of their lives, the U.S. has been at war in Afghanistan and Iraq; elected officials from across the spectrum have questioned their patriotism and their loyalties. Meanwhile, mass violence has become almost commonplace, with schools across the United States holding mass-shooting drills for children and, in the past few years, rising numbers of hate crimes against American Muslims and other minorities.\n\"Every given day there are more Muslims dying, either by these terrorists, in the name of terrorism or in the war against terrorism. But how the trauma is being internalized is what concerns me,\" Abbasi said. Because Muslim life, she said, can feel like it's worthless to others.\n\"We already know that trauma can be very disruptive. It's like your story is cut off. Suddenly it takes away your sense of safety, your sense of predictability, but it can also impact your ability to trust, relate, connect, and you feel very isolated and disconnected.\"\nAbbasi points to statistics that show young Muslims are feeling more alienated. Muslim parents report bullying in K-12 school at nearly double the rate of Jewish kids and at more than double and triple the rates of Protestant and Catholic school-age children, respectively. In some cases that bullying is coming from teachers. A survey from the Pew Research Center found that about two-thirds of Muslims don't think other Americans see them as mainstream.\n\"Post-9/11 there is a more concerted effort to demonize Muslims, to make us the other, sort of the foreign threat and the enemy,\" said Kameelah Mu'Min Rashad. She's the founder of the Muslim Wellness Foundation, which promotes healing and emotional health in American Muslim communities.\nThat message is what the 15- to 20-year-olds she counsels have heard their whole lives.\n\"Unfortunately for them it feels commonplace,\" she said. \"From extremely horrific events like what we saw happened in New Zealand in Christchurch to daily microaggressions and invalidations of their identity. And so I am very proud of how resilient American Muslim youth are. And I'm also very concerned about the onslaught and sort of daily erosion of their humanity.\"\nEvery day these young people are asked to prove their worth and their humanity, she said. A vast swath of American Muslim adults are young: At least 35 percent are between the ages of 18 and 29. Many have multiple identities that are marginalized and threatened by white supremacy \u2014 black Muslims, queer Muslims, undocumented Muslims.\nIslamophobia is 'always present'\nIt's all too familiar for Nayab Khan. She's a 22-year-old student at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\"I've only lived in a period where Islamophobia, anti-Muslim rhetoric, is always present, everywhere I go,\" she said. \"Whether that be the eighth grade, being called a terrorist for the first time, or whether that be the shooting a few days ago.\"\nThe daily aggressions have shaped her identity. She goes to the corner store near her apartment, and someone calls out, 'Go back to your country'; she gets on the train, a woman yells at her. It's part of being visibly Muslim. She's a Pakistani American who wears the religious head covering, the hijab.\n\"It's very exhausting and very laborious to always, one, have to constantly be explaining yourself,\" she said. \"And two, attempting to normalize it, when in reality I'm Muslim and I'm different and that's who I am.\"\nSo now Khan is active on campus with the Muslim Student Association. She organized a vigil after the Christchurch attacks, and she's building coalitions with other groups who combat white supremacy, xenophobia and racism.\nSeventeen-year-old Noor Bowman of Philadelphia says the anti-Muslim stuff barely registers with her anymore.\n\"As a young person growing up, they shape your experience and the way you see the world around you,\" she said. \"I'm so used to it that when people mention it, I'm like, 'Oh, I do experience microaggressions and different things.' But unfortunately it's become a part of everyday life.\"\nThings like people calling her derogatory names for an Arab \u2014 she's African-American. Telling her to go back to her country \u2014 she's from Philadelphia. So she has learned to be resilient.\n\"Hatred against Muslims and other minorities has always been there, you know, since 9/11. And for people of color ... since basically forever here in this country,\" she said. \"But I think that there are moments in history \u2014 and I think this is just history repeating itself \u2014 things change in our environment or [in the] political climate where people have heightened hatred or their hatred is emboldened.\"\nThat moment, she said, is now. At school she has taken on the role of someone who speaks out when her identities as a black Muslim woman are demonized or questioned.\n\"I'm definitely an ambassador and not because I'm forced to be but because I want to be,\" she said. \"I am very vocal in standing up to some of the things that are in our textbooks [or] are said by our teachers that are incorrect or inaccurate,\" she said. \"I'm more than happy to be the ambassador and say, 'Hey, this is not appropriate,' because if I'm not, who will be?\"",

Edward Markey, D- Mass., speaks at a rally for the Green New Deal on Tuesday outside the Capitol in Washington. The deal failed to advance in the Senate.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Updated at 5:10 p.m. ET</strong></p>\n<p>The Senate failed to move forward with Democrats' &quot;Green New Deal,&quot; but the partisan clash over the controversial environmental plan is likely to be a continuing theme ahead of the 2020 election.</p>\n<p>The measure needed 60 votes to advance but was blocked when all Senate Republicans and four Senate Democrats opposed it. The rest of the chamber's Democrats voted &quot;present.&quot;</p>\n<p>Senate Republicans forced a vote on the proposal Tuesday as part of an ongoing effort to turn the provocative climate change resolution into a wedge issue in the 2020 elections. Democrats say the GOP gambit carried its own political risk of mocking an issue that is a priority for a growing number of Americans.</p>\n<p>&quot;I think it's a real stupid political move for them to show how cavalier they are about climate change by playing games with the Green New Deal,&quot; said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., ahead of the vote. &quot;If they don't like the Green New Deal, fine, put up your own idea. It smells so disingenuous, especially to young voters. I think it's a really dumb move for them to mess around with this.&quot;</p>\n<p>All 53 Republicans oppose the Green New Deal. Most Democrats decided on a strategy to vote present led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. &quot;I'm for it, but I have no problem voting 'present,' &quot; said Murphy. Schumer wants Democrats to run more aggressively in favor of climate change policies going into 2020, although he conceded in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/us/politics/senate-democrats-climate-change.html\">an interview with The New York Times</a> earlier this month that the exact legislative form that will take is still up for debate. &quot;It's going to take us a little while to come up with a consensus that works,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced last month that he would put <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text\">the resolution</a> authored by New York Democratic freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., up for a vote. Republicans are trying to elevate the freshman lawmaker, who has described herself as a democratic socialist, and her ideas as emblematic of the Democratic Party going into 2020.</p>\n<p>&quot;In recent months our nation has watched the Democratic Party take a sharp and abrupt left turn toward socialism,&quot; McConnell said earlier this month. &quot;A flawed ideology that has been rejected time and again across the world is now driving the marquee policy proposals of the new House Democratic majority, and nothing encapsulates this as clearly as the huge, self-inflicted, national wound the Democrats are agitating for called the Green New Deal.&quot;</p>\n<p>The National Republican Senatorial Committee has also started using Ocasio-Cortez in attack ads similar to the way the party campaigns have run against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for years. In a recent tweet attacking Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who is considering a run against Republican Sen. John Cornyn, the NRSC said Castro &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRSC/status/1107730810881433601\">votes with AOC 94% of the time</a>.&quot; Castro is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. House Republican candidates are also using Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal in attack ads, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2UQwF-n3E4\">like this one</a> released Monday by former Rep. Karen Handel, R-Ga., who lost in 2018 and is seeking a rematch for a suburban Atlanta district.</p>\n<p>The Green New Deal is a loose set of ambitious goals outlined in a nonbinding resolution that calls for a global goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 &mdash; but no policy specifics on how to get there.</p>\n<p>It is also an economic plan, which calls for massive federal investment, enhancing the social safety net, and millions of new jobs to overhaul the energy and infrastructure industries in the U.S.</p>\n<p>Critics have seized on the resolution's call for a &quot;10-year national mobilization&quot; to work toward a series of goals including &quot;meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.&quot;</p>\n<p>But even some of its sponsors, like Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, don't regard that marker as a hard deadline, instead saying the resolution is &quot;aspirational.&quot;</p>\n<p>Republicans on Capitol Hill have also seized on a series of <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5729035/Green-New-Deal-FAQ.pdf\">talking points</a> Ocasio-Cortez's office accidentally circulated about the resolution that included financial support for Americans &quot;unwilling to work&quot; and for policies like building out high-speed rail so &quot;air travel stops becoming necessary.&quot; Her office said it was an old, working draft that was not intended for circulation, but it was a self-inflicted political hit that gave critics an easy line of attack.</p>\n<p>Senate Republicans have been attacking the Green New Deal for weeks. &quot;To put it mildly the Green New Deal is ambitious. To frame it more accurately, it is an unworkable pie-in-the-sky attempt to reshape every aspect of everyday Americans' lives,&quot; Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said on the Senate floor.</p>\n<p>Conservatives have rallied around <a href=\"https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-green-new-deal-scope-scale-and-implications/\">an analysis by the right-leaning American Action Forum</a> that estimates the Green New Deal would cost between $51 trillion and $93 trillion over a 10-year period. Senate Republicans are framing it as an expensive government takeover of American life as it exists today. &quot;This Green New Deal &mdash; this big government takeover of the economy &mdash; it is masked as an environmental proposal. To me, it is radical,&quot; said Sen. John Barasso, R-Wyo.</p>\n<p>The GOP strategy is intended to divide Democrats, but senators have offered a collective shrug at McConnell's vote strategy. &quot;The people are on our side as it relates to climate change and I think there's no reason to be defensive about what we want to accomplish,&quot; said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii. &quot;Republicans have no plan at all as it relates to climate change, and that's not a rhetorical flourish, that's not a partisan statement. They literally have no bill and they have no plan. They're just sort of goofing around.&quot;</p>\n<p>But at least one Senate Republican, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, is offering a counterproposal to combat climate change, which he called &quot;a New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy&quot; in a Monday Senate floor speech. It is a five-year plan that includes 10 &quot;Grand Challenges&quot; to reduce carbon emissions and create cleaner energy sources. &quot;I believe climate change is real. I believe that human emissions of greenhouse gases are a major cause of climate change,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;And I believe the Democrat cure for climate change, their 'Green New Deal,' is so far out in left field that no one is going to take it seriously.&quot; Alexander is not seeking re-election in 2020.</p>\n<p>Democrats' &quot;present&quot; vote strategy had the support of climate change activists, including the nascent <a href=\"https://www.sunrisemovement.org/\">Sunrise Movement</a>, a coalition of young activists who have recently been storming lawmakers' offices on Capitol Hill in support of the Green New Deal. A spokesman for the group told NPR the Senate vote was &quot;a sham.&quot;</p>\n<p>Democrats are emboldened by growing public consensus that climate change caused by human activities is a serious problem requiring action.

                "text": "Updated at 5:10 p.m. ET\nThe Senate failed to move forward with Democrats' \"Green New Deal,\" but the partisan clash over the controversial environmental plan is likely to be a continuing theme ahead of the 2020 election.\nThe measure needed 60 votes to advance but was blocked when all Senate Republicans and four Senate Democrats opposed it. The rest of the chamber's Democrats voted \"present.\"\nSenate Republicans forced a vote on the proposal Tuesday as part of an ongoing effort to turn the provocative climate change resolution into a wedge issue in the 2020 elections. Democrats say the GOP gambit carried its own political risk of mocking an issue that is a priority for a growing number of Americans.\n\"I think it's a real stupid political move for them to show how cavalier they are about climate change by playing games with the Green New Deal,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., ahead of the vote. \"If they don't like the Green New Deal, fine, put up your own idea. It smells so disingenuous, especially to young voters. I think it's a really dumb move for them to mess around with this.\"\nAll 53 Republicans oppose the Green New Deal. Most Democrats decided on a strategy to vote present led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"I'm for it, but I have no problem voting 'present,' \" said Murphy. Schumer wants Democrats to run more aggressively in favor of climate change policies going into 2020, although he conceded in an interview with The New York Times earlier this month that the exact legislative form that will take is still up for debate. \"It's going to take us a little while to come up with a consensus that works,\" he said.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced last month that he would put the resolution authored by New York Democratic freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., up for a vote. Republicans are trying to elevate the freshman lawmaker, who has described herself as a democratic socialist, and her ideas as emblematic of the Democratic Party going into 2020.\n\"In recent months our nation has watched the Democratic Party take a sharp and abrupt left turn toward socialism,\" McConnell said earlier this month. \"A flawed ideology that has been rejected time and again across the world is now driving the marquee policy proposals of the new House Democratic majority, and nothing encapsulates this as clearly as the huge, self-inflicted, national wound the Democrats are agitating for called the Green New Deal.\"\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee has also started using Ocasio-Cortez in attack ads similar to the way the party campaigns have run against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for years. In a recent tweet attacking Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who is considering a run against Republican Sen. John Cornyn, the NRSC said Castro \"votes with AOC 94% of the time.\" Castro is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. House Republican candidates are also using Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal in attack ads, like this one released Monday by former Rep. Karen Handel, R-Ga., who lost in 2018 and is seeking a rematch for a suburban Atlanta district.\nThe Green New Deal is a loose set of ambitious goals outlined in a nonbinding resolution that calls for a global goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 \u2014 but no policy specifics on how to get there.\nIt is also an economic plan, which calls for massive federal investment, enhancing the social safety net, and millions of new jobs to overhaul the energy and infrastructure industries in the U.S.\nCritics have seized on the resolution's call for a \"10-year national mobilization\" to work toward a series of goals including \"meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.\"\nBut even some of its sponsors, like Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, don't regard that marker as a hard deadline, instead saying the resolution is \"aspirational.\"\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have also seized on a series of talking points Ocasio-Cortez's office accidentally circulated about the resolution that included financial support for Americans \"unwilling to work\" and for policies like building out high-speed rail so \"air travel stops becoming necessary.\" Her office said it was an old, working draft that was not intended for circulation, but it was a self-inflicted political hit that gave critics an easy line of attack.\nSenate Republicans have been attacking the Green New Deal for weeks. \"To put it mildly the Green New Deal is ambitious. To frame it more accurately, it is an unworkable pie-in-the-sky attempt to reshape every aspect of everyday Americans' lives,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said on the Senate floor.\nConservatives have rallied around an analysis by the right-leaning American Action Forum that estimates the Green New Deal would cost between $51 trillion and $93 trillion over a 10-year period. Senate Republicans are framing it as an expensive government takeover of American life as it exists today. \"This Green New Deal \u2014 this big government takeover of the economy \u2014 it is masked as an environmental proposal. To me, it is radical,\" said Sen. John Barasso, R-Wyo.\nThe GOP strategy is intended to divide Democrats, but senators have offered a collective shrug at McConnell's vote strategy. \"The people are on our side as it relates to climate change and I think there's no reason to be defensive about what we want to accomplish,\" said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii. \"Republicans have no plan at all as it relates to climate change, and that's not a rhetorical flourish, that's not a partisan statement. They literally have no bill and they have no plan. They're just sort of goofing around.\"\nBut at least one Senate Republican, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, is offering a counterproposal to combat climate change, which he called \"a New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy\" in a Monday Senate floor speech. It is a five-year plan that includes 10 \"Grand Challenges\" to reduce carbon emissions and create cleaner energy sources. \"I believe climate change is real. I believe that human emissions of greenhouse gases are a major cause of climate change,\" Alexander said. \"And I believe the Democrat cure for climate change, their 'Green New Deal,' is so far out in left field that no one is going to take it seriously.\" Alexander is not seeking re-election in 2020.\nDemocrats' \"present\" vote strategy had the support of climate change activists, including the nascent Sunrise Movement, a coalition of young activists who have recently been storming lawmakers' offices on Capitol Hill in support of the Green New Deal. A spokesman for the group told NPR the Senate vote was \"a sham.\"\nDemocrats are emboldened by growing public consensus that climate change caused by human activities is a serious problem requiring action. A December 2018 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that two-thirds of Americans, 66 percent, believe action is needed to combat climate change \u2014 an upward swing of 15 percentage points since 1999. But that change in attitude has largely come from the left and middle: 71 percent of Democrats (up 42 percentage points since 1999) and 48 percent of independents (up 22 percentage points since 1999) see combating climate change as an immediate concern.\nOnly 15 percent of Republicans do \u2014 the same share of Republicans who felt that way 20 years ago.",

Much of that higher ground is in the city's poorest neighborhoods, like Liberty City and Little Haiti.

Across the region, developers are changing how they build, wealthy homeowners are reinforcing their properties, and in communities that are farther from the coast &mdash; places like Liberty City &mdash; residents are working to make sure they don't have to leave their homes.</p>\n<p>Experts say no single factor can account for rising property values. But as the risks of climate change have come into clearer view, researchers like Jesse Keenan of Harvard University have begun to take note of what is being called &quot;climate gentrification.&quot;</p>\n<p>In one study, Keenan and his colleagues found that from 1971 to 2017, real estate at higher elevations in Miami <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabb32/meta\">appreciated at higher rates</a> than properties closer to sea level.

Last fall, the city adopted a<a href=\"http://miamifl.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?ID=4929&highlightTerms=%22climate%20gentrification%22\"> resolution</a> to study &quot;gentrification that is accelerated due to climate change.&quot; The city has also earmarked $100 million from its $400 million Miami Forever bond for affordable housing.</p>\n<p>&quot;Miami is a fiscally conservative city, and while we have great wealth, we also have the majority of our population struggling to make ends meet,&quot; says Jane Gilbert, the city's chief resilience officer.</p>\n<p>That's especially true in Liberty City, the backdrop to the Oscar-winning film <em>Moonlight</em> and an area where almost half of households earn<a href=\"https://civic.miami.edu/_assets/pdf/housing-initiatives/housing-reports/Liberty-City-Economic-Analysis-and-Opportunities-Report-2017-2-2-Final.pdf\"> less than $20,000</a> a year.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" data-original=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/03/30/2019-03-20-climatechange-miami-malejandra-0171_slide-aeca542e1fbf058b6a872cc06934eaec5a04c02f-s800.jpg\" src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/03/30/2019-03-20-climatechange-miami-malejandra-0171_slide-aeca542e1fbf058b6a872cc06934eaec5a04c02f-s800-c15.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Some residents of Miami's long-underserved Liberty City neighborhood are worried that climate gentrification will drive rents up and force them to move from their homes.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Given those demographics, activists like Bryant have begun working to make sure the neighborhood remains affordable. The goal is to create more community-owned housing through what's known as a community land trust.</p>\n<p>To do so, Bryant connected with Adrian Madriz of the group<a href=\"http://www.smash.miami/about/\"> SMASH</a> &mdash; Struggle for Miami's Affordable and Sustainable Housing &mdash; to develop an apartment building in Liberty City that will be owned and operated by locals.</p>\n<p>Bryant and Madriz already have a site &mdash; a small plot of land donated by Bryant's husband &mdash; and they've posted a rendering of the project out front. It shows a two-story building with one unit for extremely low-income renters, one unit of transitional housing for LGBTQ youth and a market-rate apartment that will help subsidize the project.</p>\n<p>The building, which they plan to break ground on later this year, is expected to cost about $325,000.</p>\n<p>&quot;It is definitely a race against time,&quot; according to Madriz, who says the city has been slow to engage underserved communities in discussions about climate change resilience. &quot;We should have been having this conversation 10 years ago.&quot;</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, he's hoping their efforts can become a blueprint for other communities facing similar circumstances.</p>\n<p>&quot;I think we do have an opportunity to be a bit ahead of the curve when it comes to what kinds of policies are implemented,&quot; says Madriz. &quot;We'll hopefully ... have good and solid and decent-quality places for people to live without having to worry about if people are really going to survive the effects of sea level rise and climate change.&quot;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" data-original=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/03/27/2019-03-20-climatechange-miami-malejandra-062_slide-22cbed49cca796e89528073ea03b8cfc4d42a914-s1100.jpg\" src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/03/27/2019-03-20-climatechange-miami-malejandra-062_slide-22cbed49cca796e89528073ea03b8cfc4d42a914-s1100-c15.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Diane Walder and her husband have raised their sea wall and renovated their home to protect against stronger hurricanes and rising sea levels.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While neighborhoods like Liberty City are bracing for accelerating gentrification, developers and homeowners on the coast are adapting in other ways to the growing danger of rising seas.</p>\n<p>Diane Walder has lived in her home for 30 years. It has huge windows that look out over Biscayne Bay and a manicured lawn dotted with palm trees. In the past few years, she and her husband have watched the jade-green waters creep higher and higher.</p>\n<p>The rate of sea level rise in South Florida has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/05/10/476071206/as-waters-rise-miami-beach-builds-higher-streets-and-political-willpower\">tripled</a> in recent years, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/05/21/611919853/foreign-investors-shrug-off-miamis-rising-sea-levels\">exacerbating</a> tidal flooding. To cope, Walder and her husband replaced their old sea wall, adding several feet to hold back the rising waters. Walder declined to say how much raising the sea wall cost, but contractors say this kind of project can easily top a quarter-million dollars. Walder and her husband also strengthened their roof and replaced their windows and doors with hurricane-proof glass.</p>\n<p>&quot;That's the price you pay to live here,&quot; Walder says.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" data-original=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/03/27/2019-03-20-climatechange-miami-malejandra-060_slide-3bd90002d5de037781211e3f5945dc616e377101-s1100.jpg\" src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/03/27/2019-03-20-climatechange-miami-malejandra-060_slide-3bd90002d5de037781211e3f5945dc616e377101-s1100-c15.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Diane Walder says she's not a &quot;global warming scaredy-cat.&quot; But she says she has noticed sea levels rise around her waterfront home in Miami Beach.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Meanwhile, she says her two kids want her to move away from the water.

She questions the firmly established scientific consensus about the connection between human activity and climate change.</p>\n<p>&quot;We've had ice ages and all sorts of other things &mdash; droughts, famines. We really have very little control over that,&quot; Walder says. &quot;I can't predict what's going to happen in 100 years. I'm not going to be here in 100 years.&quot;</p>\n<p>What that future looks like depends largely on how quickly the world reduces carbon emissions, says John Englander, an oceanographer and sea level rise expert. But he warns that changes to our way of life are already inevitable.</p>\n<p>&quot;As sea level rises foot by foot and it becomes clear that we can't stop it ... we're going to have to change our concept of the shoreline and realize we can't save everything we'd like to,&quot; Englander says.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" data-original=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/03/30/2019-03-20-climatechange-miami-malejandra-032-edit_custom-2c453c3491ca4c595db2a95f3916d35de13a6606-s1100.jpg\" src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/03/30/2019-03-20-climatechange-miami-malejandra-032-edit_custom-2c453c3491ca4c595db2a95f3916d35de13a6606-s1100-c15.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Simon Koster of JDS Development Group points to a model of the Monad Terrace luxury development, which is being built with climate change in mind.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For developers like Simon Koster, that new shoreline will be made up of more resilient structures, like the Monad Terrace luxury apartments he has helped build.

                "text": "Over the past few years, Miami native Trenise Bryant has seen her neighborhood, the African-American enclave of Liberty City, start to change. Bryant grew up in one of the area's oldest public housing projects, Liberty Square. Lately, rents have gone up, and Bryant has seen people priced out and forced to move away.\nOne factor driving this, Bryant says, is climate change.\nMiami is projected to face anywhere from 1 to 3 feet of sea level rise by 2060, and as sea levels rise, higher ground inland has started to look more and more desirable. Much of that higher ground is in the city's poorest neighborhoods, like Liberty City and Little Haiti. As Bryant puts it, it has turned land in these communities into \"caviar.\"\nThe shifting real estate landscape is just one example of how, in Miami, the effects of global warming are not hypothetical predictions but realities of everyday life, prompting action by government, businesses and individuals alike. Across the region, developers are changing how they build, wealthy homeowners are reinforcing their properties, and in communities that are farther from the coast \u2014 places like Liberty City \u2014 residents are working to make sure they don't have to leave their homes.\nExperts say no single factor can account for rising property values. But as the risks of climate change have come into clearer view, researchers like Jesse Keenan of Harvard University have begun to take note of what is being called \"climate gentrification.\"\nIn one study, Keenan and his colleagues found that from 1971 to 2017, real estate at higher elevations in Miami appreciated at higher rates than properties closer to sea level. Their findings held true in 24 of the 25 jurisdictions that they studied.\nIt's an issue that Miami officials are paying attention to as well. Last fall, the city adopted a resolution to study \"gentrification that is accelerated due to climate change.\" The city has also earmarked $100 million from its $400 million Miami Forever bond for affordable housing.\n\"Miami is a fiscally conservative city, and while we have great wealth, we also have the majority of our population struggling to make ends meet,\" says Jane Gilbert, the city's chief resilience officer.\nThat's especially true in Liberty City, the backdrop to the Oscar-winning film Moonlight and an area where almost half of households earn less than $20,000 a year.\nGiven those demographics, activists like Bryant have begun working to make sure the neighborhood remains affordable. The goal is to create more community-owned housing through what's known as a community land trust.\nTo do so, Bryant connected with Adrian Madriz of the group SMASH \u2014 Struggle for Miami's Affordable and Sustainable Housing \u2014 to develop an apartment building in Liberty City that will be owned and operated by locals.\nBryant and Madriz already have a site \u2014 a small plot of land donated by Bryant's husband \u2014 and they've posted a rendering of the project out front. It shows a two-story building with one unit for extremely low-income renters, one unit of transitional housing for LGBTQ youth and a market-rate apartment that will help subsidize the project.\nThe building, which they plan to break ground on later this year, is expected to cost about $325,000.\n\"It is definitely a race against time,\" according to Madriz, who says the city has been slow to engage underserved communities in discussions about climate change resilience. \"We should have been having this conversation 10 years ago.\"\nNevertheless, he's hoping their efforts can become a blueprint for other communities facing similar circumstances.\n\"I think we do have an opportunity to be a bit ahead of the curve when it comes to what kinds of policies are implemented,\" says Madriz. \"We'll hopefully ... have good and solid and decent-quality places for people to live without having to worry about if people are really going to survive the effects of sea level rise and climate change.\"\nWhile neighborhoods like Liberty City are bracing for accelerating gentrification, developers and homeowners on the coast are adapting in other ways to the growing danger of rising seas.\nDiane Walder has lived in her home for 30 years. It has huge windows that look out over Biscayne Bay and a manicured lawn dotted with palm trees. In the past few years, she and her husband have watched the jade-green waters creep higher and higher.\nThe rate of sea level rise in South Florida has tripled in recent years, exacerbating tidal flooding. To cope, Walder and her husband replaced their old sea wall, adding several feet to hold back the rising waters. Walder declined to say how much raising the sea wall cost, but contractors say this kind of project can easily top a quarter-million dollars. Walder and her husband also strengthened their roof and replaced their windows and doors with hurricane-proof glass.\n\"That's the price you pay to live here,\" Walder says.\nMeanwhile, she says her two kids want her to move away from the water. They send her stories warning about how her part of the Miami region will be uninhabitable by the end of the century.\nBut Walder says she's not a \"global warming scaredy-cat\" and has no plans to leave. She questions the firmly established scientific consensus about the connection between human activity and climate change.\n\"We've had ice ages and all sorts of other things \u2014 droughts, famines. We really have very little control over that,\" Walder says. \"I can't predict what's going to happen in 100 years. I'm not going to be here in 100 years.\"\nWhat that future looks like depends largely on how quickly the world reduces carbon emissions, says John Englander, an oceanographer and sea level rise expert. But he warns that changes to our way of life are already inevitable.\n\"As sea level rises foot by foot and it becomes clear that we can't stop it ... we're going to have to change our concept of the shoreline and realize we can't save everything we'd like to,\" Englander says.\nFor developers like Simon Koster, that new shoreline will be made up of more resilient structures, like the Monad Terrace luxury apartments he has helped build. It's a massive complex that sits just feet from the shore. Apartments range from $1.5 million to $14 million for a rooftop penthouse, and Koster says most prospective buyers are people who already live in the Miami area \u2014 people who are looking for a comfortable and secure place to call home.\n\"It's very easy for someone who doesn't live here to say we shouldn't build here or we should go live somewhere else,\" Koster says. \"But this is an absolutely responsible, resilient place and way to live in a place that people already love.\"\nKoster says climate change isn't the first thing his buyers ask about, but they do always ask about it. At the construction site, he explains how Monad Terrace is designed to address their concerns: The base of the building is 12 feet off the ground, and a landscaped ramp will lead residents up and away from future floodwaters; the basement is a sealed concrete \"bathtub\" built to keep water out; a massive generator is on-site for power outages, as are pumps to deal with floodwaters; and the building is clad in glass that can withstand a Category 5 hurricane.\nBut Koster acknowledges it still may not be enough in the long term.\n\"There is certainly going to be sea level rise, and the debate can be [about] how many feet [it] is going to be, but it's certainly going to happen.\"\nAsked if Monad Terrace is being built with the next 100 years of climate change and sea level rise in mind, Koster pauses. \"It's probably a little bit less than that, quite frankly.\"",

And she's scared.</p>\n<p>&quot;It really is a serious mental challenge to walk through those doors and get on the plane,&quot; she explains. Sucha's fear of flying is so bad that when she was a teacher in Mississippi and wanted to visit her family in Michigan, she'd take a 14-hour bus ride rather than spend two hours in the air.</p>\n<p>The upcoming trip to Europe is a great career opportunity, but she's terrified. She can't stop watching the news about the two deadly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/tags/707053083/boeing-737-max\">Boeing 737 Max crashes</a> less than five months apart. Sucha gets nervous just talking about them. &quot;You know, if this happens with one type of plane, how many other examples of a faulty sensor or ... something malfunctioning.&quot;</p>\n<p>Boeing 737 Max airplanes <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/04/05/710477435/boeing-to-slow-production-of-737-max-jets-as-it-works-on-flight-control-software\">have been grounded</a> worldwide, and incidents like these are actually incredibly rare. But instructors who help people with fear of flying are reporting that enrollment in their classes has more than doubled in the wake of the crashes.</p>\n<p>If you aren't a nervous flyer, you might not be familiar with the industry built around fear of flying. For $2.99 you can buy an app called <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amigoingdown-fear-of-flying/id950258805?mt=8\">Am I Going Down?</a> It uses aviation statistics to calculate the risk of a crash on your upcoming flight.

Bunn also teaches relaxation techniques.</p>\n<p>Ben Kaminow, a graduate of Soar, says it's worth the price. He says his fear of flying &quot;was debilitating to my life. I would not go away with my family.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kaminow's phobia started in 1993, when his vacation flight from New York to Mexico hit strong turbulence.</p>\n<p>He was terrified.</p>\n<p>When he got back to New York, he vowed never to get on a plane again. And for the next eight years, he didn't. He even canceled his honeymoon to Greece. They drove to North Carolina instead.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Kaminow enrolled in Soar's premium package, which includes two hours of counseling. The package even includes a letter to give to your flight attendant explaining that you're working on your fear and would love to meet the captain before takeoff.</p>\n<p>For a few months, Kaminow could fly again. Then Sept. 11 happened.</p>\n<p>Kaminow was working at the World Trade Center. &quot;I was in the first tower, plane hit the building and I ... couldn't get in a plane again. So all these trips I had planned, after going through this whole thing to be able to fly again, I shut it down.&quot;</p>\n<p>It would take Kaminow another four years to board a plane again.</p>\n<p>&quot;The fear was just being inside, being uncomfortable and not being able to be in control,&quot; he says. &quot;You know when you drive a car, you have the control. Here I didn't have the control. I didn't know how to handle it.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kaminow finally did the Soar training sessions again &mdash; the relaxation techniques and trusting that pilots are highly trained and that they too want to get home safely.</p>\n<p>He says the recent Boeing 737 Max crashes did not worry him. In fact, just last week, he took a flight to Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>For him, being able to even get on that plane without being afraid was the real journey.</p>",

                "text": "This summer, musician Katie Sucha will be touring England. And she's scared.\n\"It really is a serious mental challenge to walk through those doors and get on the plane,\" she explains. Sucha's fear of flying is so bad that when she was a teacher in Mississippi and wanted to visit her family in Michigan, she'd take a 14-hour bus ride rather than spend two hours in the air.\nThe upcoming trip to Europe is a great career opportunity, but she's terrified. She can't stop watching the news about the two deadly Boeing 737 Max crashes less than five months apart. Sucha gets nervous just talking about them. \"You know, if this happens with one type of plane, how many other examples of a faulty sensor or ... something malfunctioning.\"\nBoeing 737 Max airplanes have been grounded worldwide, and incidents like these are actually incredibly rare. But instructors who help people with fear of flying are reporting that enrollment in their classes has more than doubled in the wake of the crashes.\nIf you aren't a nervous flyer, you might not be familiar with the industry built around fear of flying. For $2.99 you can buy an app called Am I Going Down? It uses aviation statistics to calculate the risk of a crash on your upcoming flight. (If you're flying from New York to Barcelona today, good news: The app estimates there is about a one in 5 million chance your plane will go down.)\nAn app called Overcome The Fear Of Flying offers hypnosis relaxation. The list goes on and on.\nThere are also myriad courses, such as those offered by FearlessFlight, Fear Of Flying Help and Soar, which has been around since 1982. Many of these classes are taught by retired pilots. Soar's founder, Capt. Tom Bunn, used to fly for United Airlines and is now a licensed therapist.\nSoar has several packages: for $180, a set of DVDs features Bunn explaining things like how planes fly and why they don't just drop out of the sky (a common concern he hears). Bunn also teaches relaxation techniques.\nBen Kaminow, a graduate of Soar, says it's worth the price. He says his fear of flying \"was debilitating to my life. I would not go away with my family.\"\nKaminow's phobia started in 1993, when his vacation flight from New York to Mexico hit strong turbulence.\nHe was terrified.\nWhen he got back to New York, he vowed never to get on a plane again. And for the next eight years, he didn't. He even canceled his honeymoon to Greece. They drove to North Carolina instead.\nEventually, Kaminow enrolled in Soar's premium package, which includes two hours of counseling. The package even includes a letter to give to your flight attendant explaining that you're working on your fear and would love to meet the captain before takeoff.\nFor a few months, Kaminow could fly again. Then Sept. 11 happened.\nKaminow was working at the World Trade Center. \"I was in the first tower, plane hit the building and I ... couldn't get in a plane again. So all these trips I had planned, after going through this whole thing to be able to fly again, I shut it down.\"\nIt would take Kaminow another four years to board a plane again.\n\"The fear was just being inside, being uncomfortable and not being able to be in control,\" he says. \"You know when you drive a car, you have the control. Here I didn't have the control. I didn't know how to handle it.\"\nKaminow finally did the Soar training sessions again \u2014 the relaxation techniques and trusting that pilots are highly trained and that they too want to get home safely.\nHe says the recent Boeing 737 Max crashes did not worry him. In fact, just last week, he took a flight to Los Angeles.\nFor him, being able to even get on that plane without being afraid was the real journey.",

They started in January, sifting through data analysis to find the biggest outliers.</p>\n<p>Then, the prosecutors used traditional law enforcement methods, including search warrants, confidential informants and surveillance, officials say.</p>\n<p>It's not yet clear how many of the defendants ensnared in this round of prosecutions may fight the charges in court. To prevail, the Justice Department would need to prove that prescriptions were written and filled outside the course of normal medical practices and that they had no legitimate medical purpose.</p>\n<p>In some examples, authorities pointed to &quot;inordinately large quantities, 100 prescriptions per day,&quot; or other suspicious facts &mdash; such as prescriptions with no evidence of a patient having been physically examined.</p>\n<p>In another episode, one doctor had a pharmacy operating outside his own waiting room.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is extreme outlier behavior,&quot; Benczkowski said. &quot;We're targeting the worst of the worst doctors in these districts.&quot;</p>\n<p>Authorities said they are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services and local public health officials so that patients who arrive at the doors of medical offices that have been shuttered will receive information and other options for medical treatment.</p>\n<p>Authorities say one goal was simply to cut off the flow of too many opioids into areas where addiction already has taken a heavy toll.</p>\n<p>&quot;In my view, if we can save one life, this will have been worth it,&quot; Benczkowski said. &quot;We're not going to just come out and try to arrest our way out of the problem.&quot;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html\">CDC has reported</a> that 130 Americans die every day of an opioid-related overdose, and federal law enforcement officials have been tasked with trying to stanch the flow of some of those drugs.</p>\n<p>&quot;The opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug crisis in American history, and Appalachia has suffered the consequences more than perhaps any other region,&quot; Attorney General William Barr said. &quot;But the Department of Justice is doing its part to help end this crisis.&quot;</p>\n<p>The efforts will continue, officials say &mdash; the strike force is expected to expand into a new area, the Western District of Virginia, starting this week.</p>",

                "text": "Updated at 11:25 a.m. ET\nFederal prosecutors are charging 60 doctors, pharmacists, medical professionals and others in connection with alleged opioid pushing and health care fraud, the Justice Department said Wednesday.\nThe charges came less than four months after the Justice Department dispatched experienced fraud prosecutors across hard-hit regions in Appalachia.\nThe cases involve more than 350,000 prescriptions for controlled substances and more than 32 million pills \u2014 the equivalent of a dose of opioids for \"every man, woman and child,\" across Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and West Virginia, said Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski.\n\"You can rest assured, when medical professionals behave like drug dealers, the Department of Justice is going to treat them like drug dealers,\" added Benczkowski, who runs the DOJ's criminal division.\nThose charged include 31 doctors, seven pharmacists, eight nurse practitioners and seven other licensed medical professionals, the Justice Department said.\nThe idea for the department's Appalachian Regional Prescription Opioid Strike Force was formed last autumn to assist areas suffering from high numbers of opioid overdoses and deaths.\nJustice Department leaders ultimately approved sending 14 health care fraud prosecutors to several different federal districts to help build cases. They started in January, sifting through data analysis to find the biggest outliers.\nThen, the prosecutors used traditional law enforcement methods, including search warrants, confidential informants and surveillance, officials say.\nIt's not yet clear how many of the defendants ensnared in this round of prosecutions may fight the charges in court. To prevail, the Justice Department would need to prove that prescriptions were written and filled outside the course of normal medical practices and that they had no legitimate medical purpose.\nIn some examples, authorities pointed to \"inordinately large quantities, 100 prescriptions per day,\" or other suspicious facts \u2014 such as prescriptions with no evidence of a patient having been physically examined.\nIn another episode, one doctor had a pharmacy operating outside his own waiting room.\n\"This is extreme outlier behavior,\" Benczkowski said. \"We're targeting the worst of the worst doctors in these districts.\"\nAuthorities said they are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services and local public health officials so that patients who arrive at the doors of medical offices that have been shuttered will receive information and other options for medical treatment.\nAuthorities say one goal was simply to cut off the flow of too many opioids into areas where addiction already has taken a heavy toll.\n\"In my view, if we can save one life, this will have been worth it,\" Benczkowski said. \"We're not going to just come out and try to arrest our way out of the problem.\"\nThe CDC has reported that 130 Americans die every day of an opioid-related overdose, and federal law enforcement officials have been tasked with trying to stanch the flow of some of those drugs.\n\"The opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug crisis in American history, and Appalachia has suffered the consequences more than perhaps any other region,\" Attorney General William Barr said. \"But the Department of Justice is doing its part to help end this crisis.\"\nThe efforts will continue, officials say \u2014 the strike force is expected to expand into a new area, the Western District of Virginia, starting this week.",

That part of the island is rainy under normal conditions. In an average year, it gets more than <a href=\"http://pr-ccc.org/download/PR%20State%20of%20the%20Climate-FINAL_ENE2015.pdf\">150 inches</a> of rain.</p>\n<p>When Maria hit in 2017, it dropped nearly a quarter of that annual rainfall in just one day.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL082077\">paper</a> published Tuesday in the journal <em>Geophysical Research Letters, </em>scientists at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and Sonoma State University in California analyzed rainfall from all 129 hurricanes that have affected Puerto Rico since reliable record keeping began in 1956.</p>\n<p>They found that Maria was a behemoth compared with past storms that raked the U.S. territory. The average amount of rain Maria dropped on the island in a day &mdash; about 15 inches &mdash; was 30 percent more than the previous record set by a tropical storm in 1985, and 66 percent more rain than fell on average during what was previously the largest and costliest storm to ever hit the island, 1998's Hurricane Georges.</p>\n<p>The rain was extremely destructive. It caused widespread flooding, destroyed crucial dams and helped knock out drinking water to nearly the entire island. A <a href=\"https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/science/G383A/article.htm\">previous paper</a>, published by another group of scientists in February, found that extreme rain triggered tens of thousands of landslides in the island's interior, &quot;in some cases isolating communities for days and weeks.&quot;</p>\n<p>In all, current estimates suggest the storm <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/08/28/642615337/hurricane-maria-caused-2-975-deaths-in-puerto-rico-independent-study-estimates\">killed about 3,000 people</a>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" data-original=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/04/16/gettyimages-856067754-ba0426aedf0dedcc1966bc0af7e893f861a99d42-s1100.jpg\" src=\"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/04/16/gettyimages-856067754-ba0426aedf0dedcc1966bc0af7e893f861a99d42-s1100-c15.jpg\"></img><figcaption>A landslide triggered by extreme rain during Hurricane Maria in 2017 washed coffins downhill from the Lares Municipal Cemetery in Puerto Rico.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The new study also set out to answer a question that, just a few years ago, scientists generally shied away from: What was the role of climate change in this single storm?</p>\n<p>As climate change models have grown more sophisticated, the field of so-called <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/10/675382734/why-scientists-are-talking-about-attribution-science-and-what-it-is\">attribution science</a> has grown more robust, allowing scientists to start investigating how our current global climate affects specific weather events. Last year, scientists <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/10/610140149/record-heat-in-the-gulf-fueled-hurricane-harveys-deluge\">directly connected</a> the warmest water ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico to the record-setting rains that fell when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas.</p>\n<p>This latest paper on Hurricane Maria makes a similar connection. The authors found that a storm of Maria's rain magnitude is nearly five times more likely to occur today, with warmer air and ocean water, than it would have in the 1950s, when global warming's effects were in their infancy.</p>\n<p>That backs up results published in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/11/14/666946363/houston-got-hammered-by-hurricane-harvey-and-its-buildings-are-partly-to-blame\">another paper</a> last year that found climate change is causing some storms to dump 5 percent to 10 percent more rain than they would otherwise.</p>\n<p>However, the authors caution, more research is necessary to investigate the complex relationship between our current climate and storms such as Maria, especially if policymakers hope to use such research to predict future storm impacts.</p>",

That part of the island is rainy under normal conditions. In an average year, it gets more than 150 inches of rain.\nWhen Maria hit in 2017, it dropped nearly a quarter of that annual rainfall in just one day.\nIn a paper published Tuesday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, scientists at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and Sonoma State University in California analyzed rainfall from all 129 hurricanes that have affected Puerto Rico since reliable record keeping began in 1956.\nThey found that Maria was a behemoth compared with past storms that raked the U.S. territory. The average amount of rain Maria dropped on the island in a day \u2014 about 15 inches \u2014 was 30 percent more than the previous record set by a tropical storm in 1985, and 66 percent more rain than fell on average during what was previously the largest and costliest storm to ever hit the island, 1998's Hurricane Georges.\nThe rain was extremely destructive. It caused widespread flooding, destroyed crucial dams and helped knock out drinking water to nearly the entire island. A previous paper, published by another group of scientists in February, found that extreme rain triggered tens of thousands of landslides in the island's interior, \"in some cases isolating communities for days and weeks.\"\nIn all, current estimates suggest the storm killed about 3,000 people.\nThe new study also set out to answer a question that, just a few years ago, scientists generally shied away from: What was the role of climate change in this single storm?\nAs climate change models have grown more sophisticated, the field of so-called attribution science has grown more robust, allowing scientists to start investigating how our current global climate affects specific weather events. Last year, scientists directly connected the warmest water ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico to the record-setting rains that fell when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas.\nThis latest paper on Hurricane Maria makes a similar connection. The authors found that a storm of Maria's rain magnitude is nearly five times more likely to occur today, with warmer air and ocean water, than it would have in the 1950s, when global warming's effects were in their infancy.\nThat backs up results published in another paper last year that found climate change is causing some storms to dump 5 percent to 10 percent more rain than they would otherwise.\nHowever, the authors caution, more research is necessary to investigate the complex relationship between our current climate and storms such as Maria, especially if policymakers hope to use such research to predict future storm impacts.",

And with all the buzz over medical marijuana, it's starting to gain an aura of healthfulness. But there are some serious health risks associated with frequent use. One of the more troubling ones is the risk of having a psychotic episode.</p>\n<p>Several past studies have found that more frequent use of pot is associated with a higher risk of psychosis &mdash; that is, when someone loses touch with reality. Now a new study <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30048-3/fulltext\">published Tuesday </a>in the <em>The Lancet Psychiatry</em> shows that consuming pot on a daily basis and especially using high-potency cannabis increases the odds of having a psychotic episode later.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is more evidence that the link between cannabis and psychosis matters,&quot; says <a href=\"https://uwm.edu/psychology/people/lisdahl-krista-m/\">Krista M. Lisdahl</a>, a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who wasn't involved in the study.</p>\n<p>The study authors consider high-potency cannabis to be products with more than 10 percent tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the compound responsible for the drug's psychoactive effects. The fact that consuming high-THC cannabis products has a greater risk is concerning, Lisdahl says, because these products are more common in the market now.</p>\n<p>The study also shows that three European cities &mdash; London, Paris and Amsterdam &mdash; where high-potency weed is most commonly available actually have higher rates of new cases of psychosis than the other cities in the study.</p>\n<p>The researchers identified 901 people aged 18 to 64 who were diagnosed with their first episode of psychosis between May 2010 and April 2015, at a mental health facility anywhere in 11 cities, including London, Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona, other cities across Europe and one site in Brazil.</p>\n<p>The researchers then asked these individuals and a control group of 1,200-plus other healthy people about their habits, including their use of weed. &quot;We asked people if they used cannabis, when did they start using it and what kind of cannabis,&quot; explains study author <a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/marta.diforti.html\">Marta Di Forti</a>, a psychiatrist and clinician scientist at King's College London.</p>\n<p>People reported the names of weed strains they used, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/01/skunk-criminalisation-drugs-reform\">skunk in the U.K</a>. or the Dutch Nederwiet, which allowed the researchers to identify the THC content in each product through data gathered by the <a href=\"http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/emcdda-home-page_en\">European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction</a> and national data from the different countries.</p>\n<p>The study found that those who used pot daily were three times more likely to have a psychotic episode compared with someone who never used the drug.</p>\n<p>Those who started using cannabis at 15 or younger had a slightly more elevated risk than those who started using in later years.</p>\n<p>Use of high-potency weed almost doubled the odds of having psychosis compared with someone who had never smoked weed, explains Di Forti.</p>\n<p>And for those who used high-potency pot on a daily basis, the risk of psychosis was even greater &mdash; four times greater than those who had never used.</p>\n<p>The easy availability of high-THC weed is a recent phenomenon, she notes. &quot;Almost 20 years ago, there wasn't much high-potency cannabis available [in the market].&quot;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671616\">One recent study</a> showed that high-potency cannabis is increasingly dominating markets. It found that the average potency of weed in Europe and the U.S. in 2017 was 17.1 percent, up from 8.9 percent in 2008.</p>\n<p>And some products can be even more potent. For example, in the Netherlands, the THC content of one product that's gained popularity, locally produced Dutch resin Nederhasj, can be as high as 67 percent.</p>\n<p>&quot;What this paper has done that's really nice is they look at rates of psychosis and cannabis use in lots of different places where underlying rates of psychosis are different,&quot; says <a href=\"https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/psychology-health-and-society/staff/suzanne-gage/\">Suzanne Gage</a>, a psychologist and epidemiologist at the University of Liverpool, who wrote a <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(19)30086-0\">commentary</a> linked to the study in <em>The Lancet Psychiatry</em>.</p>\n<p>This allowed the researchers to compare incidence of psychosis with the availability and use of high-THC cannabis in the different cities, she says.</p>\n<p>The study found that the three European cities &mdash; London, Paris and Amsterdam &mdash; had the highest rates of new diagnoses of psychosis &mdash; 45.7 per 100,000 person-years in London, 46.1 in Paris and 37.9 in Amsterdam.</p>\n<p>These are also cities where high-potency weed is most easily available and commonly used.</p>\n<p>Other European cities in Spain, Italy and France on the other hand have less than 10 percent THC content in most popular cannabis products on the market. These cities also have lower rates of new psychosis diagnosis, according to the study.</p>\n<p>&quot;One of the things that's really novel is that they could show that variation of use and potency of cannabis was related to rates of first-episode psychosis,&quot; Lisdahl says.</p>\n<p>One critique of the theory that weed contributes to psychosis risk has been that while more people are using weed worldwide, there hasn't been a corresponding rise in rates of psychosis, Gage explains. But the new study shows that cities with more easily available high-THC weed do have a higher rate of new diagnoses of psychosis.</p>\n<p>&quot;That's a really interesting finding, and that's not something anyone has done before,&quot; she adds.</p>\n<p>However, the study doesn't prove causality, cautions<a href=\"https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/profile/diana-m-martinez-md\"> Dr. Diana Martinez</a>, a psychiatrist and addiction researcher at Columbia University. &quot;You can't say that cannabis causes psychosis,&quot; she says. &quot;It's simply not supported by the data,&quot; she says.</p>\n<p>Lisdahl agrees. In order to show causality, one would have to follow people over time &mdash; before they started using weed to years later when they have their psychotic episodes, she says. &quot;You need twins in the studies, you need genetic information,&quot; among all other kinds of data, she says.</p>\n<p>Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar are complicated, &quot;multifaceted disorders,&quot; Gage notes.</p>\n<p>&quot;In all psychotic disorders, there is this multiple hit hypothesis,&quot; Martinez says. Many factors influence whether and how these disorders manifest.</p>\n<p>Genetics is known to play a major role, as are a host of environmental factors. &quot;Children who have risk of schizophrenia but grow up in stable homes ... they may not go on to develop schizophrenia,&quot; she adds.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.addictionresearch.nih.gov/abcd-study\">Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development</a> study, which is funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, is attempting to tease out the various influences, Lisdahl says. &quot;The NIH has now invested in that question.&quot;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the new findings should be of interest to anyone using cannabis, says study author Di Forti. &quot;There are people across the world who use cannabis for a variety of reasons,&quot; she says. &quot;Some of them recreationally, some of them for medicinal purposes.&quot; They should be aware that using high-potency cannabis comes with a risk, she says.</p>\n<p>&quot;They need to know what to look for and ask for help, if they come across characteristics of a psychotic disorder,&quot; she adds.</p>",

                "text": "Weed use is taking off as more states move to legalize it. And with all the buzz over medical marijuana, it's starting to gain an aura of healthfulness. But there are some serious health risks associated with frequent use. One of the more troubling ones is the risk of having a psychotic episode.\nSeveral past studies have found that more frequent use of pot is associated with a higher risk of psychosis \u2014 that is, when someone loses touch with reality. Now a new study published Tuesday in the The Lancet Psychiatry shows that consuming pot on a daily basis and especially using high-potency cannabis increases the odds of having a psychotic episode later.\n\"This is more evidence that the link between cannabis and psychosis matters,\" says Krista M. Lisdahl, a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who wasn't involved in the study.\nThe study authors consider high-potency cannabis to be products with more than 10 percent tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the compound responsible for the drug's psychoactive effects. The fact that consuming high-THC cannabis products has a greater risk is concerning, Lisdahl says, because these products are more common in the market now.\nThe study also shows that three European cities \u2014 London, Paris and Amsterdam \u2014 where high-potency weed is most commonly available actually have higher rates of new cases of psychosis than the other cities in the study.\nThe researchers identified 901 people aged 18 to 64 who were diagnosed with their first episode of psychosis between May 2010 and April 2015, at a mental health facility anywhere in 11 cities, including London, Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona, other cities across Europe and one site in Brazil.\nThe researchers then asked these individuals and a control group of 1,200-plus other healthy people about their habits, including their use of weed. \"We asked people if they used cannabis, when did they start using it and what kind of cannabis,\" explains study author Marta Di Forti, a psychiatrist and clinician scientist at King's College London.\nPeople reported the names of weed strains they used, such as skunk in the U.K. or the Dutch Nederwiet, which allowed the researchers to identify the THC content in each product through data gathered by the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction and national data from the different countries.\nThe study found that those who used pot daily were three times more likely to have a psychotic episode compared with someone who never used the drug.\nThose who started using cannabis at 15 or younger had a slightly more elevated risk than those who started using in later years.\nUse of high-potency weed almost doubled the odds of having psychosis compared with someone who had never smoked weed, explains Di Forti.\nAnd for those who used high-potency pot on a daily basis, the risk of psychosis was even greater \u2014 four times greater than those who had never used.\nThe easy availability of high-THC weed is a recent phenomenon, she notes. \"Almost 20 years ago, there wasn't much high-potency cannabis available [in the market].\"\nOne recent study showed that high-potency cannabis is increasingly dominating markets. It found that the average potency of weed in Europe and the U.S. in 2017 was 17.1 percent, up from 8.9 percent in 2008.\nAnd some products can be even more potent. For example, in the Netherlands, the THC content of one product that's gained popularity, locally produced Dutch resin Nederhasj, can be as high as 67 percent.\n\"What this paper has done that's really nice is they look at rates of psychosis and cannabis use in lots of different places where underlying rates of psychosis are different,\" says Suzanne Gage, a psychologist and epidemiologist at the University of Liverpool, who wrote a commentary linked to the study in The Lancet Psychiatry.\nThis allowed the researchers to compare incidence of psychosis with the availability and use of high-THC cannabis in the different cities, she says.\nThe study found that the three European cities \u2014 London, Paris and Amsterdam \u2014 had the highest rates of new diagnoses of psychosis \u2014 45.7 per 100,000 person-years in London, 46.1 in Paris and 37.9 in Amsterdam.\nThese are also cities where high-potency weed is most easily available and commonly used.\nOther European cities in Spain, Italy and France on the other hand have less than 10 percent THC content in most popular cannabis products on the market. These cities also have lower rates of new psychosis diagnosis, according to the study.\n\"One of the things that's really novel is that they could show that variation of use and potency of cannabis was related to rates of first-episode psychosis,\" Lisdahl says.\nOne critique of the theory that weed contributes to psychosis risk has been that while more people are using weed worldwide, there hasn't been a corresponding rise in rates of psychosis, Gage explains. But the new study shows that cities with more easily available high-THC weed do have a higher rate of new diagnoses of psychosis.\n\"That's a really interesting finding, and that's not something anyone has done before,\" she adds.\nHowever, the study doesn't prove causality, cautions Dr. Diana Martinez, a psychiatrist and addiction researcher at Columbia University. \"You can't say that cannabis causes psychosis,\" she says. \"It's simply not supported by the data,\" she says.\nLisdahl agrees. In order to show causality, one would have to follow people over time \u2014 before they started using weed to years later when they have their psychotic episodes, she says. \"You need twins in the studies, you need genetic information,\" among all other kinds of data, she says.\nPsychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar are complicated, \"multifaceted disorders,\" Gage notes.\n\"In all psychotic disorders, there is this multiple hit hypothesis,\" Martinez says. Many factors influence whether and how these disorders manifest.\nGenetics is known to play a major role, as are a host of environmental factors. \"Children who have risk of schizophrenia but grow up in stable homes ... they may not go on to develop schizophrenia,\" she adds.\nThe Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, which is funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, is attempting to tease out the various influences, Lisdahl says. \"The NIH has now invested in that question.\"\nIn the meantime, the new findings should be of interest to anyone using cannabis, says study author Di Forti. \"There are people across the world who use cannabis for a variety of reasons,\" she says. \"Some of them recreationally, some of them for medicinal purposes.\" They should be aware that using high-potency cannabis comes with a risk, she says.\n\"They need to know what to look for and ask for help, if they come across characteristics of a psychotic disorder,\" she adds.",
