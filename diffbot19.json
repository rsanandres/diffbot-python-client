Didn\u2019t hesitate,\u201d Cain said during the interview at his office in suburban Atlanta.\nTrump announced on April 4 that he wanted Cain for the job.\nBut last week, four Republican senators said they wouldn\u2019t support Cain over concerns including multiple sexual harassment allegations, which he has denied.\nUnless some of those senators change their minds \u2014 or Cain manages to convince Democrats or an Independent to back him \u2014 that would leave him short of the votes needed to be confirmed.\nKudlow said Tuesday \u201cit will probably be up to Herman Cain if he wants to stay in that process or not.\u201d\nBut Cain wasn\u2019t buying what Kudlow was selling.\n\u201cWhat Kudlow was doing was giving me an out, and I appreciate that, but I don\u2019t want an out.

When he pressed bishops to acknowledge these children, some church leaders told him that he was the product of the rarest of transgressions.</p>\n<p>But one archbishop finally showed him what he was looking for: a document of Vatican guidelines for how to deal with priests who father children, proof that he was hardly alone.</p>\n<p><em>[</em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/world/europe/vatican-sex-abuse-summit.html\"><em>Pope Francis opens a meeting devoted to the issue of clerical sexual abuse: &ldquo;We hear the cry of the little ones asking for justice.&rdquo;</em></a><em>]</em></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh my God. This is the answer,&rdquo; Mr. Doyle recalled having said as he held the document. He asked if he could have a copy, but the archbishop said no &mdash; it was secret.</p>\n<p>Now, the Vatican has confirmed, apparently for the first time, that its department overseeing the world&rsquo;s priests has general guidelines for what to do when clerics break celibacy vows and father children.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I can confirm that these guidelines exist,&rdquo; the Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti wrote in response to a query from The New York Times. &ldquo;It is an internal document.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The issue is becoming harder to ignore. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the next scandal,&rdquo; Mr. Doyle said. &ldquo;There are kids everywhere.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As the Vatican prepares for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/world/europe/pope-bishops-conference.html\">an unprecedented meeting with the world&rsquo;s bishops</a> this week on the devastating child sexual abuse crisis, many people who feel they have been wronged by the church&rsquo;s culture of secrecy and aversion to scandal will descend on Rome to press their cause.</p>\n<p>There will be the victims of clerical child abuse. There will be nuns sexually assaulted by priests. And there will be children of priests, including Mr. Doyle, who is scheduled to meet privately in Rome with several prominent prelates.</p>\n<p>For the church, stories like Mr. Doyle&rsquo;s draw uncomfortable attention to the violation of celibacy by priests and, for some former clerics and liberals inside the church, raise the issue of whether it is time to make the requirement optional, as it is in other Christian churches.</p>\n<p>The children are sometimes the result of affairs involving priests and laywomen or nuns &mdash; others of abuse or rape. There are some, exceedingly rare, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/world/europe/breitbarts-man-in-rome-a-gentle-voice-in-a-strident-chorus.html\">high-profile cases</a>, but the overwhelming majority remain out of the public eye.</p>\n<p>The tradition of celibacy among Roman Catholic clergy was broadly codified in the 12th century, but not necessarily adhered to, even in the highest places. Rodrigo Borgia, while a priest, had four children with his mistress before he became Pope Alexander VI, an excess that helped spur Martin Luther&rsquo;s Protestant Reformation. Luther wrote mockingly that the pope had as much command over celibacy as &ldquo;the natural movement of the bowels.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There are no estimates of how many such children exist. But Mr. Doyle said his support group website, <a href=\"http://www.copinginternational.com/\">Coping International</a>, has 50,000 users in 175 countries.</p>\n<p>He said he was first shown the Vatican guidelines in October 2017 by Archbishop Ivan Jurkovic, the Vatican&rsquo;s envoy to the United Nations in Geneva.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually called &lsquo;children of the ordained,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr. Doyle recalled Archbishop Jurkovic having said. &ldquo;I was shocked they had a term for it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Archbishop Jurkovic declined a request for an interview.</p>\n<p>Mr. Gisotti, the Vatican spokesman, said that the internal 2017 document synthesized a decade&rsquo;s worth of procedures, and that its &ldquo;fundamental principle&rdquo; was the &ldquo;protection of the child.&rdquo; He said the guideline &ldquo;requests&rdquo; that the father leave the priesthood to &ldquo;assume his responsibilities as a parent by devoting himself exclusively to the child.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But another Vatican official said that the &ldquo;request&rdquo; was a mere formality. Monsignor Andrea Ripa, the under secretary in the Congregation for the Clergy, which oversees more than 400,000 priests, said in a brief interview that &ldquo;it is impossible to impose&rdquo; the dismissal of the priest, and that it &ldquo;can only be asked&rdquo; for by the priest.</p>\n<p>But he added that the failure to ask to be relieved of priestly obligations was reason for the church to take action: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t ask, you will be dismissed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Irish bishops have their own guidelines, and made them public in 2017. Mr. Doyle, who once studied for the priesthood and has sought to cooperate with church leaders, played a role in developing them, said Martin Long, a spokesman for the Irish Bishops&rsquo; Conference.</p>\n<p>The Irish church&rsquo;s principles do not explicitly require clerics to leave the priesthood but state: &ldquo;A priest as any new father, should face up to his responsibilities &mdash; personal, legal, moral and financial.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Pope Francis&rsquo; remarks on the issue are limited. In his 2010 book, &ldquo;On Heaven and Earth,&rdquo; which he co-wrote when he was the archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis argues that a priest who in a moment of passion violates a vow of celibacy could potentially stay in the ministry, but one who fathers a child could not.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Natural law comes before his right as a priest,&rdquo; he writes, adding that a priest&rsquo;s first responsibility would be to his child, and that &ldquo;he must leave his priestly ministry and take care of his child.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Canon lawyers say that there is nothing in church law that forces priests to leave the priesthood for fathering children. &ldquo;There is zero, zero, zero,&rdquo; on the matter, said Laura Sgro, a canon lawyer in Rome. &ldquo;As it is not a canonical crime, there are no grounds for dismissal.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Doyle, along with some other children of priests and some former priests themselves, say they do not believe that dismissal from the priesthood is always in the child&rsquo;s best interests, and that sometimes it potentially deprives a family of a livelihood.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe unemployment is a response to paternity,&rdquo; Mr. Doyle said.</p>\n<p>Some children of priests, however, wish their fathers were forced out of the ministry.</p>\n<p>Rev. Pietro Tosi was 54 when he raped Erik Zattoni&rsquo;s mother, who was 14, Mr. Zattoni said. Her family tried to force the priest to recognize their son, but he refused. The family was evicted from their parish-owned home in a tiny town outside Ferrara, Italy, where they often bumped into each other.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He never said anything,&rdquo; said Mr. Zattoni, now 37.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Mr. Zattoni sued Father Tosi, demanding to be recognized. A court-ordered DNA test demonstrated that he was in fact the priest&rsquo;s son. The Vatican eventually instructed Father Tosi&rsquo;s bishop to admonish him and remind him of his responsibilities as a father, but did not demand his removal from the priesthood.</p>\n<p>After a national news program highlighted his case, hundreds of Italians filled a Ferrara piazza in 2013 to show support for Mr. Zattoni and press Francis to take up his case.</p>\n<p>Father Tosi died in 2014, still a priest.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The justice I got,&rdquo; Mr. Zattoni said, &ldquo;came through a court sentence based on DNA.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The children of priests are increasingly turning to DNA tests to prove that their parents are either priests or nuns.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a breakthrough, and anybody can do it,&rdquo; said Linda Lawless, 56, an amateur genealogist in Australia, and herself the daughter of a priest, who has helped members of Coping International.</p>\n<p>Her mother kept her paternity secret, but Ms. Lawless remembered noticing as a child that her mother was &ldquo;absolutely terrified&rdquo; whenever priests visited the house. Last year, she used a DNA test and the increasingly comprehensive databases and family trees of the genealogical website Ancestry.com to confirm that her biological father was a priest.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when the secret came out,&rdquo; she said.</p>",

                "text": "Suzanne Kreiter/Boston Globe, via Getty Images\nROME \u2014 Vincent Doyle, a psychotherapist in Ireland, was 28 when he learned from his mother that the Roman Catholic priest he had always known as his godfather was in truth his biological father.\nThe discovery led him to create a global support group to help other children of priests, like him, suffering from the internalized shame that comes with being born from church scandal. When he pressed bishops to acknowledge these children, some church leaders told him that he was the product of the rarest of transgressions.\nBut one archbishop finally showed him what he was looking for: a document of Vatican guidelines for how to deal with priests who father children, proof that he was hardly alone.\n[Pope Francis opens a meeting devoted to the issue of clerical sexual abuse: \u201cWe hear the cry of the little ones asking for justice.\u201d]\n\u201cOh my God. This is the answer,\u201d Mr. Doyle recalled having said as he held the document. He asked if he could have a copy, but the archbishop said no \u2014 it was secret.\nNow, the Vatican has confirmed, apparently for the first time, that its department overseeing the world\u2019s priests has general guidelines for what to do when clerics break celibacy vows and father children.\n\u201cI can confirm that these guidelines exist,\u201d the Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti wrote in response to a query from The New York Times. \u201cIt is an internal document.\u201d\nThe issue is becoming harder to ignore. \u201cIt\u2019s the next scandal,\u201d Mr. Doyle said. \u201cThere are kids everywhere.\u201d\nAs the Vatican prepares for an unprecedented meeting with the world\u2019s bishops this week on the devastating child sexual abuse crisis, many people who feel they have been wronged by the church\u2019s culture of secrecy and aversion to scandal will descend on Rome to press their cause.\nThere will be the victims of clerical child abuse. There will be nuns sexually assaulted by priests. And there will be children of priests, including Mr. Doyle, who is scheduled to meet privately in Rome with several prominent prelates.\nFor the church, stories like Mr. Doyle\u2019s draw uncomfortable attention to the violation of celibacy by priests and, for some former clerics and liberals inside the church, raise the issue of whether it is time to make the requirement optional, as it is in other Christian churches.\nThe children are sometimes the result of affairs involving priests and laywomen or nuns \u2014 others of abuse or rape. There are some, exceedingly rare, high-profile cases, but the overwhelming majority remain out of the public eye.\nThe tradition of celibacy among Roman Catholic clergy was broadly codified in the 12th century, but not necessarily adhered to, even in the highest places. Rodrigo Borgia, while a priest, had four children with his mistress before he became Pope Alexander VI, an excess that helped spur Martin Luther\u2019s Protestant Reformation. Luther wrote mockingly that the pope had as much command over celibacy as \u201cthe natural movement of the bowels.\u201d\nThere are no estimates of how many such children exist. But Mr. Doyle said his support group website, Coping International, has 50,000 users in 175 countries.\nHe said he was first shown the Vatican guidelines in October 2017 by Archbishop Ivan Jurkovic, the Vatican\u2019s envoy to the United Nations in Geneva.\n\u201cYou\u2019re actually called \u2018children of the ordained,\u2019\u201d Mr. Doyle recalled Archbishop Jurkovic having said. \u201cI was shocked they had a term for it.\u201d\nArchbishop Jurkovic declined a request for an interview.\nMr. Gisotti, the Vatican spokesman, said that the internal 2017 document synthesized a decade\u2019s worth of procedures, and that its \u201cfundamental principle\u201d was the \u201cprotection of the child.\u201d He said the guideline \u201crequests\u201d that the father leave the priesthood to \u201cassume his responsibilities as a parent by devoting himself exclusively to the child.\u201d\nBut another Vatican official said that the \u201crequest\u201d was a mere formality. Monsignor Andrea Ripa, the under secretary in the Congregation for the Clergy, which oversees more than 400,000 priests, said in a brief interview that \u201cit is impossible to impose\u201d the dismissal of the priest, and that it \u201ccan only be asked\u201d for by the priest.\nBut he added that the failure to ask to be relieved of priestly obligations was reason for the church to take action: \u201cIf you don\u2019t ask, you will be dismissed.\u201d\nThe Irish bishops have their own guidelines, and made them public in 2017. Mr. Doyle, who once studied for the priesthood and has sought to cooperate with church leaders, played a role in developing them, said Martin Long, a spokesman for the Irish Bishops\u2019 Conference.\nThe Irish church\u2019s principles do not explicitly require clerics to leave the priesthood but state: \u201cA priest as any new father, should face up to his responsibilities \u2014 personal, legal, moral and financial.\u201d\nPope Francis\u2019 remarks on the issue are limited. In his 2010 book, \u201cOn Heaven and Earth,\u201d which he co-wrote when he was the archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis argues that a priest who in a moment of passion violates a vow of celibacy could potentially stay in the ministry, but one who fathers a child could not.\n\u201cNatural law comes before his right as a priest,\u201d he writes, adding that a priest\u2019s first responsibility would be to his child, and that \u201che must leave his priestly ministry and take care of his child.\u201d\nCanon lawyers say that there is nothing in church law that forces priests to leave the priesthood for fathering children. \u201cThere is zero, zero, zero,\u201d on the matter, said Laura Sgro, a canon lawyer in Rome. \u201cAs it is not a canonical crime, there are no grounds for dismissal.\u201d\nMr. Doyle, along with some other children of priests and some former priests themselves, say they do not believe that dismissal from the priesthood is always in the child\u2019s best interests, and that sometimes it potentially deprives a family of a livelihood.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe unemployment is a response to paternity,\u201d Mr. Doyle said.\nSome children of priests, however, wish their fathers were forced out of the ministry.\nRev. Pietro Tosi was 54 when he raped Erik Zattoni\u2019s mother, who was 14, Mr. Zattoni said. Her family tried to force the priest to recognize their son, but he refused. The family was evicted from their parish-owned home in a tiny town outside Ferrara, Italy, where they often bumped into each other.\n\u201cHe never said anything,\u201d said Mr. Zattoni, now 37.\nIn 2010, Mr. Zattoni sued Father Tosi, demanding to be recognized. A court-ordered DNA test demonstrated that he was in fact the priest\u2019s son. The Vatican eventually instructed Father Tosi\u2019s bishop to admonish him and remind him of his responsibilities as a father, but did not demand his removal from the priesthood.\nAfter a national news program highlighted his case, hundreds of Italians filled a Ferrara piazza in 2013 to show support for Mr. Zattoni and press Francis to take up his case.\nFather Tosi died in 2014, still a priest.\n\u201cThe justice I got,\u201d Mr. Zattoni said, \u201ccame through a court sentence based on DNA.\u201d\nThe children of priests are increasingly turning to DNA tests to prove that their parents are either priests or nuns.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a breakthrough, and anybody can do it,\u201d said Linda Lawless, 56, an amateur genealogist in Australia, and herself the daughter of a priest, who has helped members of Coping International.\nHer mother kept her paternity secret, but Ms. Lawless remembered noticing as a child that her mother was \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d whenever priests visited the house. Last year, she used a DNA test and the increasingly comprehensive databases and family trees of the genealogical website Ancestry.com to confirm that her biological father was a priest.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the secret came out,\u201d she said.",

Whitaker, his newly installed attorney general, with a question. He asked whether Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York and a Trump ally, could be put in charge of the widening investigation, according to several American officials with direct knowledge of the call.</p>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to &ldquo;jump on a grenade&rdquo; for the president, knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge because Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker, as he often does with his aides, and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the president&rsquo;s many legal problems go away.</p>\n<p>Trying to install a perceived loyalist atop a widening inquiry is a familiar tactic for Mr. Trump, who has been struggling to beat back the investigations that have consumed his presidency. His efforts have exposed him to accusations of obstruction of justice as Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finishes his work investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s public war on the inquiry has gone on long enough that it is no longer shocking. Mr. Trump rages almost daily to his 58 million Twitter followers that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/22/opinion/trump-cohen-mueller-investigation.html\">Mr. Mueller is on a &ldquo;witch hunt&rdquo;</a> and has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/politics/trump-vocabulary-mob.html\">adopted the language of Mafia bosses</a> by calling those who cooperate with the special counsel &ldquo;rats.&rdquo; His lawyer talks openly about a strategy to smear and discredit the special counsel investigation. The president&rsquo;s allies in Congress and the conservative news media warn of an insidious plot inside the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to subvert a democratically elected president.</p>\n<p>An examination by The New York Times reveals the extent of an even more sustained, more secretive assault by Mr. Trump on the machinery of federal law enforcement. Interviews with dozens of current and former government officials and others close to Mr. Trump, as well as a review of confidential White House documents, reveal numerous unreported episodes in a two-year drama.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Matthew G.

Whitaker, the former acting attorney general, is now under scrutiny by the House for possible perjury.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>White House lawyers wrote a confidential memo expressing concern about the president&rsquo;s staff peddling misleading information in public about the firing of Michael T. Flynn, the Trump administration&rsquo;s first national security adviser. Mr. Trump had private conversations with Republican lawmakers about a campaign to attack the Mueller investigation. And there was the episode when he asked his attorney general about putting Mr. Berman in charge of the Manhattan investigation.</p>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who this month told a congressional committee that Mr. Trump had never pressured him over the various investigations, is now under scrutiny by House Democrats for possible perjury.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, after The Times article published, Mr. Trump denied that he had asked Mr. Whitaker if Mr. Berman could be put in charge of the investigation. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know who gave you that, that&rsquo;s more fake news,&rdquo; Mr. Trump said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of fake news out there. No, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A Justice Department spokeswoman said Tuesday that the White House had not asked Mr. Whitaker to interfere in the investigations. &ldquo;Under oath to the House Judiciary Committee, then-Acting Attorney General Whitaker stated that &lsquo;at no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel&rsquo;s investigation or any other investigation,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec. &ldquo;Mr. Whitaker stands by his testimony.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The story of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s attempts to defang the investigations has been voluminously covered in the news media, to such a degree that many Americans have lost track of how unusual his behavior is. But fusing the strands reveals an extraordinary story of a president who has attacked the law enforcement apparatus of his own government like no other president in history, and who has turned the effort into an obsession. Mr. Trump has done it with the same tactics he once used in his business empire: demanding fierce loyalty from employees, applying pressure tactics to keep people in line and protecting the brand &mdash; himself &mdash; at all costs.</p>\n<p>It is a public relations strategy as much as a legal strategy &mdash; a campaign to create a narrative of a president <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/deep-state-trump.html\">hounded by his &ldquo;deep state&rdquo; foes</a>. The new Democratic majority in the House, and the prospect of a wave of investigations on Capitol Hill this year, will test whether the strategy shores up Mr. Trump&rsquo;s political support or puts his presidency in greater peril. The president has spent much of his time venting publicly about there being &ldquo;no collusion&rdquo; with Russia before the 2016 election, which has diverted attention from a growing body of evidence that he has tried to impede the various investigations.</p>\n<p>Julie O&rsquo;Sullivan, a criminal law professor at Georgetown University, said she believed there was ample public evidence that Mr. Trump had the &ldquo;corrupt intent&rdquo; to try to derail the Mueller investigation, the legal standard for an obstruction of justice case.</p>\n<p>But this is far from a routine criminal investigation, she said, and Mr. Mueller will have to make judgments about the effect on the country of making a criminal case against the president. Democrats in the House have said they will wait for Mr. Mueller to finish his work before making a decision about whether the president&rsquo;s behavior warrants impeachment.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Mueller investigation, there are at least two other federal inquiries that touch the president and his advisers &mdash; the Manhattan investigation focused on the hush money payments made by Mr. Trump&rsquo;s lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, and an inquiry examining the flow of foreign money to the Trump inaugural committee.</p>\n<p>The president&rsquo;s defenders counter that most of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s actions under scrutiny fall under his authority as the head of the executive branch. They argue that the Constitution gives the president sweeping powers to hire and fire, to start and stop law enforcement proceedings, and to grant presidential pardons to friends and allies. A sitting American president cannot be indicted, according to current Justice Department policy.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s lawyers add this novel response: The president has been public about his disdain for the Mueller investigation and other federal inquiries, so he is hardly engaged in a conspiracy. He fired one F.B.I. director and considered firing his replacement. He <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/us/politics/jeff-sessions-trump.html\">humiliated his first attorney general</a> for being unable to &ldquo;control&rdquo; the Russia investigation and installed a replacement, Mr. Whitaker, who has told people he believed his job was to protect the president. But that, they say, is Donald Trump being Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>In other words, the president&rsquo;s brazen public behavior might be his best defense.</p>\n<h2>The first crisis</h2>\n<p>The investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign aided the effort presented the new White House with its first crisis after only 25 days. The president immediately tried to contain the damage.</p>\n<p>It was Feb. 14, 2017, and Mr. Trump and his advisers were in the Oval Office debating how to explain the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html\">resignation of Mr. Flynn</a>, the national security adviser, the previous night. Mr. Flynn, who had been a top campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, was under investigation by the F.B.I. for his contacts with Russians and secret foreign lobbying efforts for Turkey.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department had already raised questions that Mr. Flynn might be subject to blackmail by the Russians for misleading White House officials about the Russian contacts, and inside the White House there was a palpable fear that the Russia investigation could consume the early months of a new administration.</p>\n<p>As the group in the Oval Office talked, one of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s advisers mentioned in passing what Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, then the speaker of the House, had told reporters &mdash; that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Flynn to resign.</p>\n<p>It was unclear where Mr. Ryan had gotten that information, but Mr. Trump seized on Mr. Ryan&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;That sounds better,&rdquo; the president said, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump turned to the White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, who was preparing to brief the news media.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Say that,&rdquo; Mr. Trump ordered.</p>\n<p>But was that true? Mr. Spicer pressed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Say that I asked for his resignation,&rdquo; Mr. Trump repeated.</p>\n<p>The president appeared to have little concern about what he told the public about Mr. Flynn&rsquo;s departure, and he quickly warmed to the new narrative. The episode was among the first of multiple ham-handed efforts by the president to carry out a dual strategy: publicly casting the Russia story as an overblown hoax and privately trying to contain the investigation&rsquo;s reach.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This Russia thing is all over now because I fired Flynn,&rdquo; Mr. Trump said over lunch that day, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/michael-flynn-trump-chris-christie.html\">a new book by Chris Christie</a>, a former New Jersey governor and a longtime Trump ally.</p>\n<p>Mr. Christie was taken aback. &ldquo;This Russia thing is far from over,&rdquo; Mr. Christie wrote that he told Mr. Trump, who responded: &ldquo;What do you mean? Flynn met with the Russians. That was the problem. I fired Flynn. It&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jared Kushner, the president&rsquo;s son-in-law and senior adviser, who was also at the lunch, chimed in, according to Mr. Christie&rsquo;s book: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, firing Flynn ends the whole Russia thing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As Mr. Trump was lunching with Mr. Christie, lawyers in the White House Counsel&rsquo;s Office met with Mr. Spicer about what he should say from the White House podium about what was a sensitive national security investigation. But when Mr. Spicer&rsquo;s briefing began, the lawyers started hearing numerous misstatements &mdash; some bigger than others &mdash; and ended up compiling them all in a memo.</p>\n<p>The lawyers&rsquo; main concern was that Mr. Spicer overstated how exhaustively the White House had investigated Mr. Flynn and that he said, wrongly, that administration lawyers had concluded there were no legal issues surrounding Mr. Flynn&rsquo;s conduct.</p>\n<p>Mr. Spicer later told people he stuck to talking points that he was given by the counsel&rsquo;s office, and that White House lawyers expressed concern only about how he had described the thoroughness of the internal inquiry into Mr. Flynn. The memo written by the lawyers said that Mr. Spicer was presented with a longer list of his misstatements. The White House never publicly corrected the record.</p>\n<p>Later that day, Mr. Trump confronted the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, in the Oval Office. The president told him that Mr. Spicer had done a great job explaining how the White House had handled the firing. Then he asked Mr. Comey to end the F.B.I.&rsquo;s investigation into Mr. Flynn, and said that Mr. Flynn was a good guy.</p>\n<p>Mr. Comey responded, according to a memo he wrote at the time, that Mr. Flynn was indeed a good guy. But he said nothing about ending the F.B.I. investigation.</p>\n<p>By March, Mr. Trump was in a rage that his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had recused himself from the Russia inquiry because investigators were looking into the campaign, of which Mr. Sessions had been a part. Mr. Trump was also growing increasingly frustrated with Mr. Comey, who refused to say publicly that the president was not under investigation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/james-comey-fired-fbi.html\">Mr. Trump finally fired Mr. Comey in May</a>. But the president and the White House gave conflicting accounts of their reasoning for the dismissal, which served only to exacerbate the president&rsquo;s legal exposure.</p>\n<p>A week after the firing, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html\">The Times disclosed</a> that the president had asked Mr. Comey to end the Flynn investigation. The next day, the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, appointed Mr. Mueller, a Republican, as special counsel.</p>\n<p>Instead of ending the Russia investigation by firing Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump had drastically raised the stakes.</p>\n<h2>Boiling frustration</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/robert-mueller-special-counsel-russia-investigation.html\">Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s appointment</a> fueled Mr. Trump&rsquo;s anger and what became increasingly reckless behavior &mdash; setting off a string of actions over the summer of 2017 that could end up as building blocks in a case by Congress that the president engaged in a broad effort to thwart the investigation.</p>\n<p>On Twitter and in news media interviews, Mr. Trump tried to pressure investigators and undermine the credibility of potential witnesses in the Mueller investigation.</p>\n<p>He directed much of his venom at Mr. Sessions, who had recused himself in March from overseeing the Russia investigation because of contacts he had during the election with Russia&rsquo;s ambassador to the United States.</p>\n<p>The president humiliated Mr. Sessions at every turn, and stunned Washington when he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/us/politics/trump-interview-sessions-russia.html\">said during an interview with The Times</a> that he never would have named Mr. Sessions attorney general if he had known Mr. Sessions would step aside from the investigation.</p>\n<p>Privately, Mr. Trump tried to remove Mr. Sessions &mdash; he said he wanted an attorney general who would protect him &mdash; but did not fire him, in part because White House aides dodged the president&rsquo;s orders to demand his resignation. The president even called his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, over the Fourth of July weekend to ask him to pressure Mr. Sessions to resign. Mr. Lewandowski was noncommittal and never acted on the request.</p>\n<p>One of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s lawyers also reached out that summer to the lawyers for two of his former aides &mdash; Paul Manafort and Mr. Flynn &mdash; to discuss possible pardons. The discussions raised questions about whether the president was willing to offer pardons to influence their decisions about whether to plead guilty and cooperate in the Mueller investigation.</p>\n<p>The president even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html\">tried to fire Mr. Mueller himself</a>, a move that could have brought an end to the investigation. Just weeks after Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s appointment, the president insisted that he ought to be fired because of perceived conflicts of interest. Mr. Trump&rsquo;s White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, who would have been responsible for carrying out the order, refused and threatened to quit.</p>\n<p>The president eventually backed off.</p>\n<h2>A new strategy: discrediting an investigation</h2>\n<p>Sitting in the Delta Sky Lounge during a layover at Atlanta&rsquo;s airport in July 2017, Representative Matt Gaetz, a first-term Republican from the Florida Panhandle, decided it was time to attack. Mr. Gaetz, then 35, believed that the president&rsquo;s allies in Congress needed a coordinated strategy to fight back against an investigation they viewed as deeply unfair and politically biased.</p>\n<p>He called Representative Jim Jordan, a conservative Republican from Ohio, and told him the party needed &ldquo;to go play offense,&rdquo; Mr. Gaetz recalled in an interview.</p>\n<p>The two men believed that Republican leaders, who publicly praised the appointment of Mr. Mueller, had been beaten into a defensive crouch by the unending chaos and were leaving Democrats unchecked to &ldquo;pistol whip&rdquo; the president with constant accusations about his campaign and Russia.</p>\n<p>So they began to investigate the investigators. Mr. Trump and his lawyers enthusiastically encouraged the strategy, which, according to some polls, convinced many Americans that the country&rsquo;s law enforcement apparatus was determined to bring down the president.</p>\n<p>Within days of their conversation, Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Jordan drafted a letter to Mr. Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein, <a href=\"https://republicans-judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/072717_HJC-Letter-to-AG-DAG.pdf\">the first call for the appointment of a second special counsel</a> to essentially reinvestigate Hillary Clinton for her handling of her emails while secretary of state &mdash; the case had ended in the summer of 2016 &mdash; as well as the origins of the F.B.I.&rsquo;s investigation of Mr. Flynn and other Trump associates.</p>\n<p>The letter itself, with the signatures of only 20 House Republicans, gained little traction at first. But an important shift was underway: At a time when Mr. Trump&rsquo;s lawyers were urging him to cooperate with Mr. Mueller and to tone down his Twitter feed, the president&rsquo;s fiercest allies in Congress and the conservative news media were busy trying to flip the script on the federal law enforcement agencies and officials who began the inquiry into Mr. Trump&rsquo;s campaign.</p>\n<p>Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Jordan began huddling with like-minded Republicans, sometimes including Representative Mark Meadows, a press-savvy North Carolinian close to Mr. Trump, and Representative Devin Nunes of California, the head of the House Intelligence Committee.</p>\n<p>Mr. Nunes, the product of a dairy farming family in California&rsquo;s Central Valley, had already emerged as one of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s strongest allies in Congress. He worked closely with Mr. Flynn during the Trump transition after the 2016 election, and he had a history of battling the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies, which he sometimes accused of coloring their analysis for partisan reasons. In the spring of 2017, Mr. Nunes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/us/politics/devin-nunes-wiretapping-trump.html\">sought to bolster Mr. Trump&rsquo;s false claim</a> that President Barack Obama had ordered an illegal wiretap on Trump Tower in Manhattan.</p>\n<p>Using Congress&rsquo;s oversight powers, the Republican lawmakers succeeded in doing what Mr. Trump could not realistically do on his own: force into the open some of the government&rsquo;s most sensitive investigative files &mdash; including secret wiretaps and the existence of an F.B.I. informant &mdash; that were part of the Russia inquiry.</p>\n<p>House Republicans <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/clinton-investigation-trump.html\">opened investigations</a> into the F.B.I.&rsquo;s handling of the Clinton email case and a debunked Obama-era uranium deal indirectly linked to Mrs. Clinton. The lawmakers got a big assist from the Justice Department, which gave them private texts recovered from two senior F.B.I. officials who had been on the Russia case. The officials &mdash; Peter Strzok and Lisa Page &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/fbi-trump-russia.html\">repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump in their texts</a>, which were featured in a loop on Fox News and became a centerpiece of an evolving and powerful conservative narrative about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/us/politics/trump-mueller-russia-republican-campaign.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fnicholas-fandos\">a cabal inside the F.B.I. and Justice Department</a> to take down Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p>The president cheered on the lawmakers on Twitter, in interviews and in private, urging Mr. Gaetz on <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/12/matt-gaetz-trump-mueller-russia-investigation-292731\">Air Force One</a> in December 2017 and in subsequent phone calls to keep up the House Republicans&rsquo; oversight work. He was hoping for fair treatment from Mr. Mueller, Mr. Trump told Mr. Gaetz in one of the calls just after the congressman appeared on Fox News, but that did not preclude him from encouraging his allies&rsquo; scrutiny of the investigation.</p>\n<p>Later, when Mr. Nunes produced <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/02/us/politics/nunes-memo-gop-fbi-annotated.html\">a memo alleging that the F.B.I. had abused its authority</a> in spying on a former Trump campaign associate, Carter Page, Mr. Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/960530665702912000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">called Mr. Nunes a &ldquo;Great American Hero&rdquo;</a> in a tweet. (The F.B.I. said it had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/us/politics/fbi-director-republicans-secret-memo.html\">&ldquo;grave concerns&rdquo;</a> about the memo&rsquo;s accuracy.)</p>\n<p>The president became an active participant in the effort to attack American law enforcement. He <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/us/politics/trump-justice-department-house-republicans.html\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/us/politics/trump-russia-investigation-documents-declassified.html?module=inline\">leaned</a> on administration officials on behalf of the lawmakers &mdash; urging Mr. Rosenstein and other law enforcement leaders to flout procedure and share sensitive materials about the open case with Congress. As president, Mr. Trump has ultimate authority over information that passes through the government, but his interventions were unusual.</p>\n<p>By the spring of 2018, Mr. Nunes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/12/us/politics/devin-nunes-justice-department-documents-special-counsel.html\">zeroed in on new targets</a>. In one case, he threatened to hold Mr. Rosenstein in contempt of Congress or even try to impeach him if the documents he wanted were not turned over, including the file used to open the Russia case. In another, he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/12/us/politics/devin-nunes-justice-department-documents-special-counsel.html\">pressed the Justice Department for sensitive information</a> about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/us/politics/trump-fbi-informant-russia-investigation.html\">a trusted F.B.I. informant</a> used in the Russia investigation, a Cambridge professor named Stefan Halper &mdash; even as intelligence officials said that the release of the information could damage relationships with important allies.</p>\n<p>The president chimed in, accusing the F.B.I., without evidence, of planting a spy in his campaign. &ldquo;SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!&rdquo; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/999246677549768704\">Mr. Trump wrote</a>, turning the term into a popular hashtag.</p>\n<p>Most Senate Republicans tried to ignore the House tactics, and not all House Republicans who participated in the investigations agreed with the scorched-earth approach. Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and a former federal prosecutor who had led Republicans in the Benghazi investigation, felt that figures like Mr. Gaetz and, in some cases, Mr. Nunes, were hurting their own cause with a sloppy, overhyped campaign that damaged Congress&rsquo;s credibility.</p>\n<p>Former Representative Thomas J. Rooney of Florida, a Republican who sat on the Intelligence Committee and retired last year, was similarly critical. &ldquo;The efforts to tag Mueller as a witch hunt are a mistake,&rdquo; he said in an interview. &ldquo;The guy is an American hero. He is somebody who has always spouted the rule of law in what our country is about.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Mr. Gaetz makes no apologies.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do I think it&rsquo;s right that our work in the Congress has aided in the president&rsquo;s defense?&rdquo; he asked, before answering his own question.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I think it is right.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ultimately, his strategy was successful in softening the ground for a shift in the president&rsquo;s legal strategy &mdash; away from relatively quiet cooperation with Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s investigators and toward a targeted and relentless frontal attack on their credibility and impartiality.</p>\n<h2>The president opens a new front</h2>\n<p>Last April, Mr. Trump hired Rudolph W. Giuliani, his longtime friend and a famously combative former mayor of New York, as his personal lawyer and ubiquitous television attack dog. A new war had begun.</p>\n<p>In jettisoning his previous legal team &mdash; which had counseled that Mr. Trump should cooperate with the investigation &mdash; the president decided to combine a legal strategy with a public relations campaign in an aggressive effort to undermine the credibility of both Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>Mr. Mueller was unlikely to indict Mr. Trump, the president&rsquo;s advisers believed, so the real danger to his presidency was impeachment &mdash; a political act that Congress would probably carry out only with broad public support. If Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s investigation could be discredited, then impeachment might be less likely.</p>\n<p>Months of caustic presidential tweets and fiery television interviews by Mr. Giuliani unfolded. The former mayor accused Mr. Mueller, without evidence, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/giuliani-wont-explain-the-very-nasty-business-relationship-trump-says-he-had-with-mueller/2018/07/30/c8088ede-93f8-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html\">of bias and ignoring facts to carry out an anti-Trump agenda</a>. He called one of Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s top prosecutors, Andrew Weissmann, a <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1807/30/nday.05.html\">&ldquo;complete scoundrel.&rdquo;</a></p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, Mr. Giuliani was getting help from a curious source: Kevin Downing, a lawyer for Mr. Manafort. Mr. Manafort, who had been Mr. Trump&rsquo;s 2016 campaign chairman, had agreed to cooperate with the special counsel after being convicted of financial crimes in an attempt to lessen a potentially lengthy prison sentence. Mr. Downing shared details about prosecutors&rsquo; lines of questioning, Mr. Giuliani admitted late last year.</p>\n<p>It was a highly unusual arrangement &mdash; the lawyer for a cooperating witness providing valuable information to the president&rsquo;s lawyer at a time when his client remained in the sights of the special counsel&rsquo;s prosecutors. The arrangement angered Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s investigators, who questioned what Mr. Manafort was trying to gain from the arrangement.</p>\n<p>The attacks on the Mueller investigation appeared to have an effect. Last summer, polling <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/polling/department-justice-mueller-russian/2018/07/11/09a17592-8123-11e8-b3b5-b61896f90919_page.html\">showed a 14-point uptick</a> in the percentage of Americans polled who disapproved of how Mr. Mueller was handling the inquiry. &ldquo;Mueller is now slightly more distrusted than trusted, and Trump is a little ahead of the game,&rdquo; Mr. Giuliani said during an interview in August.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So I think we&rsquo;ve done really well,&rdquo; Mr. Giuliani added. &ldquo;And my client&rsquo;s happy.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>The F.B.I. raids Michael Cohen</h2>\n<p>But Mr. Giuliani and his client had a serious problem, which they were slow to comprehend.</p>\n<p>In April, the F.B.I. raided the Manhattan office and residences of Mr. Cohen &mdash; the president&rsquo;s lawyer and fixer &mdash; walking off with business records, emails and other documents dating back years. At first, Mr. Trump was not concerned.</p>\n<p>The president told advisers that Mr. Rosenstein assured him at the time that the Cohen investigation had nothing to do with him. In the president&rsquo;s recounting, Mr. Rosenstein told him that the inquiry in New York was about Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s business dealings, that it did not involve the president and that it was not about Russia. Since then, Mr. Trump has asked his advisers if Mr. Rosenstein was deliberately misleading him to keep him calm.</p>\n<p>Mr. Giuliani initially portrayed Mr. Cohen as &ldquo;honest,&rdquo; and the president praised him publicly. But Mr. Cohen soon told prosecutors in New York how Mr. Trump had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/nyregion/michael-cohen-plea-deal-trump.html\">ordered him during the 2016 campaign to buy the silence</a> of women who claimed they had sex with Mr. Trump. In a separate bid for leniency, Mr. Cohen told Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s prosecutors about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-russia-mueller.html\">Mr. Trump&rsquo;s participation in negotiations</a> during the height of the presidential campaign to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump was now battling twin investigations that seemed to be moving ever close to him. And Mr. Cohen, once the president&rsquo;s fiercest defender, was becoming his chief tormentor.</p>\n<p>In a court appearance in August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty and told a judge that Mr. Trump had ordered him to arrange the payments to the women, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s descriptions of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s actions made the president, in effect, an unindicted co-conspirator and raised the prospect of the president being charged after he leaves office. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, who in January became the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over the matter, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/us/politics/trump-mueller-cohen-manafort.html\">said the implied offense was probably impeachable</a>.</p>\n<p>The president struck back, launching a volley of tweets that savaged Mr. Cohen and his family &mdash; insinuating that Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s father-in-law had engaged in unexamined criminal activity. He called Mr. Cohen a &ldquo;rat.&rdquo; The messages <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/trump-cohen-testimony.html\">infuriated Democratic lawmakers</a>, who claimed the president was trying to threaten and intimidate a witness before testimony Mr. Cohen planned before Congress.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only been threatened by the truth,&rdquo; the president responded.</p>\n<h2>Another attorney general takes office</h2>\n<p>As the prosecutors closed in, Mr. Trump felt a more urgent need to gain control of the investigation.</p>\n<p>He made the call to Mr. Whitaker to see if he could put Mr. Berman in charge of the New York investigation. The inquiry is run by Robert Khuzami, a career prosecutor who took over after Mr. Berman, whom Mr. Trump appointed, recused himself because of a routine conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>What exactly Mr. Whitaker did after the call is unclear, but there is no evidence that he took any direct steps to intervene in the Manhattan investigation. He did, however, tell some associates at the Justice Department that the prosecutors in New York required &ldquo;adult supervision.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Second, Mr. Trump moved on to a new attorney general, William P. Barr, whom Mr. Trump nominated for the job in part because of a memo Mr. Barr wrote last summer making a case that a sitting American president cannot be charged with obstruction of justice for acts well within his power &mdash; like firing an F.B.I. director.</p>\n<p>A president cannot be found to have broken the law, Mr. Barr argued, if he was exercising his executive powers to fire subordinates or use his &ldquo;complete authority to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The memo might have ingratiated Mr. Barr to his future boss, but Mr. Barr is also respected among the rank and file in the Justice Department. Many officials there hope he will try to change the Trump administration&rsquo;s combative tone toward the department, as well as toward the F.B.I.</p>\n<p>Whether it is too late is another question. Mr. Trump&rsquo;s language, and allegations of &ldquo;deep state&rdquo; excesses, are now embedded in the political conversation, used as a cudgel by the president&rsquo;s supporters.</p>\n<p>This past December, days before Mr. Flynn was to be sentenced for lying to the F.B.I., his lawyers wrote a memo to the judge suggesting that federal agents had tricked the former national security adviser into lying. The judge roundly rejected that argument, and on sentencing day, he excoriated Mr. Flynn for his crimes.</p>\n<p>The argument about F.B.I. trickery did, however, appear to please the one man who holds great power over Mr. Flynn&rsquo;s future &mdash; the constitutional power to pardon.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1074993036831191045\">Mr. Trump tweeted cheerily</a> on the morning of the sentencing.</p>",

                "text": "Doug Mills/The New York Times\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As federal prosecutors in Manhattan gathered evidence late last year about President Trump\u2019s role in silencing women with hush payments during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump called Matthew G. Whitaker, his newly installed attorney general, with a question. He asked whether Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York and a Trump ally, could be put in charge of the widening investigation, according to several American officials with direct knowledge of the call.\nMr. Whitaker, who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to \u201cjump on a grenade\u201d for the president, knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge because Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker, as he often does with his aides, and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the president\u2019s many legal problems go away.\nTrying to install a perceived loyalist atop a widening inquiry is a familiar tactic for Mr. Trump, who has been struggling to beat back the investigations that have consumed his presidency. His efforts have exposed him to accusations of obstruction of justice as Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finishes his work investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nMr. Trump\u2019s public war on the inquiry has gone on long enough that it is no longer shocking. Mr. Trump rages almost daily to his 58 million Twitter followers that Mr. Mueller is on a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and has adopted the language of Mafia bosses by calling those who cooperate with the special counsel \u201crats.\u201d His lawyer talks openly about a strategy to smear and discredit the special counsel investigation. The president\u2019s allies in Congress and the conservative news media warn of an insidious plot inside the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to subvert a democratically elected president.\nAn examination by The New York Times reveals the extent of an even more sustained, more secretive assault by Mr. Trump on the machinery of federal law enforcement. Interviews with dozens of current and former government officials and others close to Mr. Trump, as well as a review of confidential White House documents, reveal numerous unreported episodes in a two-year drama.\nWhite House lawyers wrote a confidential memo expressing concern about the president\u2019s staff peddling misleading information in public about the firing of Michael T. Flynn, the Trump administration\u2019s first national security adviser. Mr. Trump had private conversations with Republican lawmakers about a campaign to attack the Mueller investigation. And there was the episode when he asked his attorney general about putting Mr. Berman in charge of the Manhattan investigation.\nMr. Whitaker, who this month told a congressional committee that Mr. Trump had never pressured him over the various investigations, is now under scrutiny by House Democrats for possible perjury.\nOn Tuesday, after The Times article published, Mr. Trump denied that he had asked Mr. Whitaker if Mr. Berman could be put in charge of the investigation. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know who gave you that, that\u2019s more fake news,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fake news out there. No, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\nA Justice Department spokeswoman said Tuesday that the White House had not asked Mr. Whitaker to interfere in the investigations. \u201cUnder oath to the House Judiciary Committee, then-Acting Attorney General Whitaker stated that \u2018at no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel\u2019s investigation or any other investigation,\u2019\u201d said the spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec. \u201cMr. Whitaker stands by his testimony.\u201d\nThe story of Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to defang the investigations has been voluminously covered in the news media, to such a degree that many Americans have lost track of how unusual his behavior is. But fusing the strands reveals an extraordinary story of a president who has attacked the law enforcement apparatus of his own government like no other president in history, and who has turned the effort into an obsession. Mr. Trump has done it with the same tactics he once used in his business empire: demanding fierce loyalty from employees, applying pressure tactics to keep people in line and protecting the brand \u2014 himself \u2014 at all costs.\nIt is a public relations strategy as much as a legal strategy \u2014 a campaign to create a narrative of a president hounded by his \u201cdeep state\u201d foes. The new Democratic majority in the House, and the prospect of a wave of investigations on Capitol Hill this year, will test whether the strategy shores up Mr. Trump\u2019s political support or puts his presidency in greater peril. The president has spent much of his time venting publicly about there being \u201cno collusion\u201d with Russia before the 2016 election, which has diverted attention from a growing body of evidence that he has tried to impede the various investigations.\nJulie O\u2019Sullivan, a criminal law professor at Georgetown University, said she believed there was ample public evidence that Mr. Trump had the \u201ccorrupt intent\u201d to try to derail the Mueller investigation, the legal standard for an obstruction of justice case.\nBut this is far from a routine criminal investigation, she said, and Mr. Mueller will have to make judgments about the effect on the country of making a criminal case against the president. Democrats in the House have said they will wait for Mr. Mueller to finish his work before making a decision about whether the president\u2019s behavior warrants impeachment.\nIn addition to the Mueller investigation, there are at least two other federal inquiries that touch the president and his advisers \u2014 the Manhattan investigation focused on the hush money payments made by Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, and an inquiry examining the flow of foreign money to the Trump inaugural committee.\nThe president\u2019s defenders counter that most of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions under scrutiny fall under his authority as the head of the executive branch. They argue that the Constitution gives the president sweeping powers to hire and fire, to start and stop law enforcement proceedings, and to grant presidential pardons to friends and allies. A sitting American president cannot be indicted, according to current Justice Department policy.\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers add this novel response: The president has been public about his disdain for the Mueller investigation and other federal inquiries, so he is hardly engaged in a conspiracy. He fired one F.B.I. director and considered firing his replacement. He humiliated his first attorney general for being unable to \u201ccontrol\u201d the Russia investigation and installed a replacement, Mr. Whitaker, who has told people he believed his job was to protect the president. But that, they say, is Donald Trump being Donald Trump.\nIn other words, the president\u2019s brazen public behavior might be his best defense.\nThe first crisis\nThe investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign aided the effort presented the new White House with its first crisis after only 25 days. The president immediately tried to contain the damage.\nIt was Feb. 14, 2017, and Mr. Trump and his advisers were in the Oval Office debating how to explain the resignation of Mr. Flynn, the national security adviser, the previous night. Mr. Flynn, who had been a top campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, was under investigation by the F.B.I. for his contacts with Russians and secret foreign lobbying efforts for Turkey.\nThe Justice Department had already raised questions that Mr. Flynn might be subject to blackmail by the Russians for misleading White House officials about the Russian contacts, and inside the White House there was a palpable fear that the Russia investigation could consume the early months of a new administration.\nAs the group in the Oval Office talked, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers mentioned in passing what Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, then the speaker of the House, had told reporters \u2014 that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Flynn to resign.\nIt was unclear where Mr. Ryan had gotten that information, but Mr. Trump seized on Mr. Ryan\u2019s words. \u201cThat sounds better,\u201d the president said, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump turned to the White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, who was preparing to brief the news media.\n\u201cSay that,\u201d Mr. Trump ordered.\nBut was that true? Mr. Spicer pressed.\n\u201cSay that I asked for his resignation,\u201d Mr. Trump repeated.\nThe president appeared to have little concern about what he told the public about Mr. Flynn\u2019s departure, and he quickly warmed to the new narrative. The episode was among the first of multiple ham-handed efforts by the president to carry out a dual strategy: publicly casting the Russia story as an overblown hoax and privately trying to contain the investigation\u2019s reach.\n\u201cThis Russia thing is all over now because I fired Flynn,\u201d Mr. Trump said over lunch that day, according to a new book by Chris Christie, a former New Jersey governor and a longtime Trump ally.\nMr. Christie was taken aback. \u201cThis Russia thing is far from over,\u201d Mr. Christie wrote that he told Mr. Trump, who responded: \u201cWhat do you mean? Flynn met with the Russians. That was the problem. I fired Flynn. It\u2019s over.\u201d\nJared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, who was also at the lunch, chimed in, according to Mr. Christie\u2019s book: \u201cThat\u2019s right, firing Flynn ends the whole Russia thing.\u201d\nAs Mr. Trump was lunching with Mr. Christie, lawyers in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office met with Mr. Spicer about what he should say from the White House podium about what was a sensitive national security investigation. But when Mr. Spicer\u2019s briefing began, the lawyers started hearing numerous misstatements \u2014 some bigger than others \u2014 and ended up compiling them all in a memo.\nThe lawyers\u2019 main concern was that Mr. Spicer overstated how exhaustively the White House had investigated Mr. Flynn and that he said, wrongly, that administration lawyers had concluded there were no legal issues surrounding Mr. Flynn\u2019s conduct.\nMr. Spicer later told people he stuck to talking points that he was given by the counsel\u2019s office, and that White House lawyers expressed concern only about how he had described the thoroughness of the internal inquiry into Mr. Flynn. The memo written by the lawyers said that Mr. Spicer was presented with a longer list of his misstatements. The White House never publicly corrected the record.\nLater that day, Mr. Trump confronted the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, in the Oval Office. The president told him that Mr. Spicer had done a great job explaining how the White House had handled the firing. Then he asked Mr. Comey to end the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into Mr. Flynn, and said that Mr. Flynn was a good guy.\nMr. Comey responded, according to a memo he wrote at the time, that Mr. Flynn was indeed a good guy. But he said nothing about ending the F.B.I. investigation.\nBy March, Mr. Trump was in a rage that his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had recused himself from the Russia inquiry because investigators were looking into the campaign, of which Mr. Sessions had been a part. Mr. Trump was also growing increasingly frustrated with Mr. Comey, who refused to say publicly that the president was not under investigation.\nMr. Trump finally fired Mr. Comey in May. But the president and the White House gave conflicting accounts of their reasoning for the dismissal, which served only to exacerbate the president\u2019s legal exposure.\nA week after the firing, The Times disclosed that the president had asked Mr. Comey to end the Flynn investigation. The next day, the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, appointed Mr. Mueller, a Republican, as special counsel.\nInstead of ending the Russia investigation by firing Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump had drastically raised the stakes.\nBoiling frustration\nMr. Mueller\u2019s appointment fueled Mr. Trump\u2019s anger and what became increasingly reckless behavior \u2014 setting off a string of actions over the summer of 2017 that could end up as building blocks in a case by Congress that the president engaged in a broad effort to thwart the investigation.\nOn Twitter and in news media interviews, Mr. Trump tried to pressure investigators and undermine the credibility of potential witnesses in the Mueller investigation.\nHe directed much of his venom at Mr. Sessions, who had recused himself in March from overseeing the Russia investigation because of contacts he had during the election with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\nThe president humiliated Mr. Sessions at every turn, and stunned Washington when he said during an interview with The Times that he never would have named Mr. Sessions attorney general if he had known Mr. Sessions would step aside from the investigation.\nPrivately, Mr. Trump tried to remove Mr. Sessions \u2014 he said he wanted an attorney general who would protect him \u2014 but did not fire him, in part because White House aides dodged the president\u2019s orders to demand his resignation. The president even called his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, over the Fourth of July weekend to ask him to pressure Mr. Sessions to resign. Mr. Lewandowski was noncommittal and never acted on the request.\nOne of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers also reached out that summer to the lawyers for two of his former aides \u2014 Paul Manafort and Mr. Flynn \u2014 to discuss possible pardons. The discussions raised questions about whether the president was willing to offer pardons to influence their decisions about whether to plead guilty and cooperate in the Mueller investigation.\nThe president even tried to fire Mr. Mueller himself, a move that could have brought an end to the investigation. Just weeks after Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment, the president insisted that he ought to be fired because of perceived conflicts of interest. Mr. Trump\u2019s White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, who would have been responsible for carrying out the order, refused and threatened to quit.\nThe president eventually backed off.\nA new strategy: discrediting an investigation\nSitting in the Delta Sky Lounge during a layover at Atlanta\u2019s airport in July 2017, Representative Matt Gaetz, a first-term Republican from the Florida Panhandle, decided it was time to attack. Mr. Gaetz, then 35, believed that the president\u2019s allies in Congress needed a coordinated strategy to fight back against an investigation they viewed as deeply unfair and politically biased.\nHe called Representative Jim Jordan, a conservative Republican from Ohio, and told him the party needed \u201cto go play offense,\u201d Mr. Gaetz recalled in an interview.\nThe two men believed that Republican leaders, who publicly praised the appointment of Mr. Mueller, had been beaten into a defensive crouch by the unending chaos and were leaving Democrats unchecked to \u201cpistol whip\u201d the president with constant accusations about his campaign and Russia.\nSo they began to investigate the investigators. Mr. Trump and his lawyers enthusiastically encouraged the strategy, which, according to some polls, convinced many Americans that the country\u2019s law enforcement apparatus was determined to bring down the president.\nWithin days of their conversation, Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Jordan drafted a letter to Mr. Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein, the first call for the appointment of a second special counsel to essentially reinvestigate Hillary Clinton for her handling of her emails while secretary of state \u2014 the case had ended in the summer of 2016 \u2014 as well as the origins of the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation of Mr. Flynn and other Trump associates.\nThe letter itself, with the signatures of only 20 House Republicans, gained little traction at first. But an important shift was underway: At a time when Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers were urging him to cooperate with Mr. Mueller and to tone down his Twitter feed, the president\u2019s fiercest allies in Congress and the conservative news media were busy trying to flip the script on the federal law enforcement agencies and officials who began the inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\nMr. Gaetz and Mr. Jordan began huddling with like-minded Republicans, sometimes including Representative Mark Meadows, a press-savvy North Carolinian close to Mr. Trump, and Representative Devin Nunes of California, the head of the House Intelligence Committee.\nMr. Nunes, the product of a dairy farming family in California\u2019s Central Valley, had already emerged as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest allies in Congress. He worked closely with Mr. Flynn during the Trump transition after the 2016 election, and he had a history of battling the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies, which he sometimes accused of coloring their analysis for partisan reasons. In the spring of 2017, Mr. Nunes sought to bolster Mr. Trump\u2019s false claim that President Barack Obama had ordered an illegal wiretap on Trump Tower in Manhattan.\nUsing Congress\u2019s oversight powers, the Republican lawmakers succeeded in doing what Mr. Trump could not realistically do on his own: force into the open some of the government\u2019s most sensitive investigative files \u2014 including secret wiretaps and the existence of an F.B.I. informant \u2014 that were part of the Russia inquiry.\nHouse Republicans opened investigations into the F.B.I.\u2019s handling of the Clinton email case and a debunked Obama-era uranium deal indirectly linked to Mrs. Clinton. The lawmakers got a big assist from the Justice Department, which gave them private texts recovered from two senior F.B.I. officials who had been on the Russia case. The officials \u2014 Peter Strzok and Lisa Page \u2014 repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump in their texts, which were featured in a loop on Fox News and became a centerpiece of an evolving and powerful conservative narrative about a cabal inside the F.B.I. and Justice Department to take down Mr. Trump.\nThe president cheered on the lawmakers on Twitter, in interviews and in private, urging Mr. Gaetz on Air Force One in December 2017 and in subsequent phone calls to keep up the House Republicans\u2019 oversight work. He was hoping for fair treatment from Mr. Mueller, Mr. Trump told Mr. Gaetz in one of the calls just after the congressman appeared on Fox News, but that did not preclude him from encouraging his allies\u2019 scrutiny of the investigation.\nLater, when Mr. Nunes produced a memo alleging that the F.B.I. had abused its authority in spying on a former Trump campaign associate, Carter Page, Mr. Trump called Mr. Nunes a \u201cGreat American Hero\u201d in a tweet. (The F.B.I. said it had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the memo\u2019s accuracy.)\nThe president became an active participant in the effort to attack American law enforcement. He repeatedly leaned on administration officials on behalf of the lawmakers \u2014 urging Mr. Rosenstein and other law enforcement leaders to flout procedure and share sensitive materials about the open case with Congress. As president, Mr. Trump has ultimate authority over information that passes through the government, but his interventions were unusual.\nBy the spring of 2018, Mr. Nunes zeroed in on new targets. In one case, he threatened to hold Mr. Rosenstein in contempt of Congress or even try to impeach him if the documents he wanted were not turned over, including the file used to open the Russia case. In another, he pressed the Justice Department for sensitive information about a trusted F.B.I. informant used in the Russia investigation, a Cambridge professor named Stefan Halper \u2014 even as intelligence officials said that the release of the information could damage relationships with important allies.\nThe president chimed in, accusing the F.B.I., without evidence, of planting a spy in his campaign. \u201cSPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, turning the term into a popular hashtag.\nMost Senate Republicans tried to ignore the House tactics, and not all House Republicans who participated in the investigations agreed with the scorched-earth approach. Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and a former federal prosecutor who had led Republicans in the Benghazi investigation, felt that figures like Mr. Gaetz and, in some cases, Mr. Nunes, were hurting their own cause with a sloppy, overhyped campaign that damaged Congress\u2019s credibility.\nFormer Representative Thomas J. Rooney of Florida, a Republican who sat on the Intelligence Committee and retired last year, was similarly critical. \u201cThe efforts to tag Mueller as a witch hunt are a mistake,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe guy is an American hero. He is somebody who has always spouted the rule of law in what our country is about.\u201d\nBut Mr. Gaetz makes no apologies.\n\u201cDo I think it\u2019s right that our work in the Congress has aided in the president\u2019s defense?\u201d he asked, before answering his own question.\n\u201cYeah, I think it is right.\u201d\nUltimately, his strategy was successful in softening the ground for a shift in the president\u2019s legal strategy \u2014 away from relatively quiet cooperation with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators and toward a targeted and relentless frontal attack on their credibility and impartiality.\nThe president opens a new front\nLast April, Mr. Trump hired Rudolph W. Giuliani, his longtime friend and a famously combative former mayor of New York, as his personal lawyer and ubiquitous television attack dog. A new war had begun.\nIn jettisoning his previous legal team \u2014 which had counseled that Mr. Trump should cooperate with the investigation \u2014 the president decided to combine a legal strategy with a public relations campaign in an aggressive effort to undermine the credibility of both Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department.\nMr. Mueller was unlikely to indict Mr. Trump, the president\u2019s advisers believed, so the real danger to his presidency was impeachment \u2014 a political act that Congress would probably carry out only with broad public support. If Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation could be discredited, then impeachment might be less likely.\nMonths of caustic presidential tweets and fiery television interviews by Mr. Giuliani unfolded. The former mayor accused Mr. Mueller, without evidence, of bias and ignoring facts to carry out an anti-Trump agenda. He called one of Mr. Mueller\u2019s top prosecutors, Andrew Weissmann, a \u201ccomplete scoundrel.\u201d\nBehind the scenes, Mr. Giuliani was getting help from a curious source: Kevin Downing, a lawyer for Mr. Manafort. Mr. Manafort, who had been Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign chairman, had agreed to cooperate with the special counsel after being convicted of financial crimes in an attempt to lessen a potentially lengthy prison sentence. Mr. Downing shared details about prosecutors\u2019 lines of questioning, Mr. Giuliani admitted late last year.\nIt was a highly unusual arrangement \u2014 the lawyer for a cooperating witness providing valuable information to the president\u2019s lawyer at a time when his client remained in the sights of the special counsel\u2019s prosecutors. The arrangement angered Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators, who questioned what Mr. Manafort was trying to gain from the arrangement.\nThe attacks on the Mueller investigation appeared to have an effect. Last summer, polling showed a 14-point uptick in the percentage of Americans polled who disapproved of how Mr. Mueller was handling the inquiry. \u201cMueller is now slightly more distrusted than trusted, and Trump is a little ahead of the game,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said during an interview in August.\n\u201cSo I think we\u2019ve done really well,\u201d Mr. Giuliani added. \u201cAnd my client\u2019s happy.\u201d\nThe F.B.I. raids Michael Cohen\nBut Mr. Giuliani and his client had a serious problem, which they were slow to comprehend.\nIn April, the F.B.I. raided the Manhattan office and residences of Mr. Cohen \u2014 the president\u2019s lawyer and fixer \u2014 walking off with business records, emails and other documents dating back years. At first, Mr. Trump was not concerned.\nThe president told advisers that Mr. Rosenstein assured him at the time that the Cohen investigation had nothing to do with him. In the president\u2019s recounting, Mr. Rosenstein told him that the inquiry in New York was about Mr. Cohen\u2019s business dealings, that it did not involve the president and that it was not about Russia. Since then, Mr. Trump has asked his advisers if Mr. Rosenstein was deliberately misleading him to keep him calm.\nMr. Giuliani initially portrayed Mr. Cohen as \u201chonest,\u201d and the president praised him publicly. But Mr. Cohen soon told prosecutors in New York how Mr. Trump had ordered him during the 2016 campaign to buy the silence of women who claimed they had sex with Mr. Trump. In a separate bid for leniency, Mr. Cohen told Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors about Mr. Trump\u2019s participation in negotiations during the height of the presidential campaign to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.\nMr. Trump was now battling twin investigations that seemed to be moving ever close to him. And Mr. Cohen, once the president\u2019s fiercest defender, was becoming his chief tormentor.\nIn a court appearance in August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty and told a judge that Mr. Trump had ordered him to arrange the payments to the women, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Mr. Cohen\u2019s descriptions of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions made the president, in effect, an unindicted co-conspirator and raised the prospect of the president being charged after he leaves office. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, who in January became the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over the matter, said the implied offense was probably impeachable.\nThe president struck back, launching a volley of tweets that savaged Mr. Cohen and his family \u2014 insinuating that Mr. Cohen\u2019s father-in-law had engaged in unexamined criminal activity. He called Mr. Cohen a \u201crat.\u201d The messages infuriated Democratic lawmakers, who claimed the president was trying to threaten and intimidate a witness before testimony Mr. Cohen planned before Congress.\n\u201cHe\u2019s only been threatened by the truth,\u201d the president responded.\nAnother attorney general takes office\nAs the prosecutors closed in, Mr. Trump felt a more urgent need to gain control of the investigation.\nHe made the call to Mr. Whitaker to see if he could put Mr. Berman in charge of the New York investigation. The inquiry is run by Robert Khuzami, a career prosecutor who took over after Mr. Berman, whom Mr. Trump appointed, recused himself because of a routine conflict of interest.\nWhat exactly Mr. Whitaker did after the call is unclear, but there is no evidence that he took any direct steps to intervene in the Manhattan investigation. He did, however, tell some associates at the Justice Department that the prosecutors in New York required \u201cadult supervision.\u201d\nSecond, Mr. Trump moved on to a new attorney general, William P. Barr, whom Mr. Trump nominated for the job in part because of a memo Mr. Barr wrote last summer making a case that a sitting American president cannot be charged with obstruction of justice for acts well within his power \u2014 like firing an F.B.I. director.\nA president cannot be found to have broken the law, Mr. Barr argued, if he was exercising his executive powers to fire subordinates or use his \u201ccomplete authority to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding.\u201d\nThe memo might have ingratiated Mr. Barr to his future boss, but Mr. Barr is also respected among the rank and file in the Justice Department. Many officials there hope he will try to change the Trump administration\u2019s combative tone toward the department, as well as toward the F.B.I.\nWhether it is too late is another question. Mr. Trump\u2019s language, and allegations of \u201cdeep state\u201d excesses, are now embedded in the political conversation, used as a cudgel by the president\u2019s supporters.\nThis past December, days before Mr. Flynn was to be sentenced for lying to the F.B.I., his lawyers wrote a memo to the judge suggesting that federal agents had tricked the former national security adviser into lying. The judge roundly rejected that argument, and on sentencing day, he excoriated Mr. Flynn for his crimes.\nThe argument about F.B.I. trickery did, however, appear to please the one man who holds great power over Mr. Flynn\u2019s future \u2014 the constitutional power to pardon.\n\u201cGood luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted cheerily on the morning of the sentencing.",

Johnson, visibly angry at a morning news conference, said Mr. Smollett had taken advantage of the pain and anger of racism, draining resources that could have been used to investigate other crimes for which people were actually suffering.</p>\n<p><em>[Read more: </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/arts/jussie-smollett-empire-fox.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article\"><em>Jussie Smollett returns to work on &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; after his arrest</em></a><em>.]</em></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention,&rdquo; he said, referring to the news media.</p>\n<p>At an afternoon bail hearing, a judge set Mr. Smollett&rsquo;s bond at $100,000. He was released late Thursday afternoon after posting bond and returned to the &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; set in Chicago where the show is being shot.</p>\n<p>In Thursday&rsquo;s proceedings, members of Mr. Smollett&rsquo;s family were in the courtroom with him as the judge, John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr., said that he found the investigators&rsquo; account of the incident disturbing, particularly the assertion that Mr. Smollett had used a rope around his neck to heighten outrage.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We live in a country where you are presumed innocent,&rdquo; the judge said. &ldquo;However, if these allegations are true, I find them utterly outrageous. Especially the violent, despicable use of a noose, which conjures such evil in our country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Smollett, wearing a black puffer jacket, did not react, though occasionally he whispered to his legal team during the 25-minute proceeding. One of the lawyers, Jack Prior, agreed that the police account was outrageous, but he said it also was not true.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He wants nothing more than to clear his name,&rdquo; Mr. Prior said of his client.</p>\n<p>Later on Thursday, Mr. Smollett&rsquo;s legal team released a statement saying the court system had trampled &ldquo;the presumption of innocence&rdquo; in a &ldquo;law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It said that Mr. Smollett &ldquo;feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The police say Mr. Smollett hired two brothers to carry out the assault and paid them $3,500. They have a copy of the check used to pay them, the police said. Also recovered, they said, were phone records that showed Mr. Smollett speaking to the brothers an hour before the incident took place, and then an hour after.</p>\n<p>In a document prepared for the bail hearing, prosecutors said they had video of the brothers at the scene, text messages they shared with Mr. Smollett and their testimony as to how Mr. Smollett had recruited them for the plan. He even had them visit the scene of what investigators contend was the fake attack, a spot near his home, on an earlier night to prepare, prosecutors said.</p>\n<p>But, the prosecutor&rsquo;s document said, a video camera at the spot that Mr. Smollett had hoped would capture a phony attack was pointed in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p>Superintendent Johnson declined to indicate why investigators now believe that Mr. Smollett had also played the chief role in mailing himself a threatening letter. The letter, which arrived a week before the reported assault, contained a white powder (crushed ibuprofen) and a sketch of what appeared to be a man being hanged and phrases, including &ldquo;You will die.&rdquo; The return address said &ldquo;MAGA,&rdquo; a reference to a slogan from the Trump campaign.</p>\n<p>Mr. Johnson referred further comment about the letter to the F.B.I., which is investigating that part of the case. The agency declined to comment.</p>\n<p>The actor, who surrendered to the authorities on Thursday morning, has insisted the attack occurred and that he has not done anything wrong. The felony disorderly conduct charge he faces carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison.</p>\n<p>After his arrest, the reversal in public opinion for Mr. Smollett was quick and damaging. The report of the attack spurred a national outpouring of support, including from Democratic presidential candidates and President Trump, who called the incident &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/jussie-smollett-attack.html\">horrible</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>[Read more about </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/who-is-jussie-smollett.html\"><em>Jussie Smollett&rsquo;s life and career</em></a><em>.]</em></p>\n<p>On Thursday, some of the celebrities who had initially supported Mr. Smollett began taking down their social media posts from the aftermath of the attack.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1098615818512941057?s=21\">in a post on Twitter</a>, &ldquo;.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JussieSmollett\">@JussieSmollett</a> - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MAGA?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.dataminr.com%2Fapp%2Fdashboard.html%23\">#MAGA</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Fox, the network that airs &ldquo;Empire,&rdquo; released a statement Thursday saying it was evaluating the situation and the network&rsquo;s options. &ldquo;We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process,&rdquo; the statement said. Network executives later confirmed that among those options was that he return to the set and resume work as Jamal Lyon.</p>\n<p>Mr. Smollett&rsquo;s official salary has not been made public, but he reportedly earned between <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jussie-smollett-arrested-charged-false-report-empire_n_5c6eb643e4b0f40774ccc84d\">$65,000</a> and <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/02/jussie-smollett-arrest-fox-reaction-empire-production-chicago-police-1202561757/\">$100,000 an</a> episode on &ldquo;Empire.&rdquo; It was not immediately apparent whether he has had any clashes with executives at Fox, who, as recently as Wednesday, issued <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/arts/television/fox-jussie-smollett.html\">a statement highly supportive</a> of the actor, calling him a &ldquo;consummate professional.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At their news conference and the bail hearing, police and prosecutors unveiled much of what they had uncovered about the reported attack. Mr. Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay, had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/arts/television/empire-jussie-smollett-attacked.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fsopan-deb\">told the police</a> that at roughly 2 a.m. on Jan. 29, two masked men attacked him on the 300 block of Lower East North Water Street in downtown Chicago. He said his assailants directed homophobic and racial slurs at him, put a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him. Mr. Smollett said the assault occurred after he went to pick up food.</p>\n<p>A detective commander, Edward Wodnicki, said at the news conference that investigators interviewed Mr. Smollett at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and found he had scratches on his face, some bruising, but no serious injuries.</p>\n<p>The investigators approached the case as a possible hate crime, but had difficulty finding evidence to match Mr. Smollett&rsquo;s account. The attack itself was not visible on surveillance cameras.</p>\n<p>Days into their inquiry, investigators released a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/television/jussie-smollett-attack-investigation.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fsopan-deb\">surveillance image of two men</a> thought to be potential persons of interest, now known to be the two brothers who have said they helped stage a fake attack.</p>\n<p>Police said they had spotted the brothers on surveillance footage that showed them taking a cab from the area of the reported assault. Investigators tracked the cab, interviewed the driver, and identified the passengers as Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/arts/television/jussie-smollett-interview.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fsopan-deb&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=inline&version=latest&contentPlacement=5&pgtype=collection\"> associates of Mr. Smollett&rsquo;s</a>.</p>\n<p>Both had worked as extras on &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; and Mr. Smollett later acknowledged that he had paid to have one of them train him for a music video. Prosecutors said one of the brothers had sometimes supplied him with designer drugs.</p>\n<p>The men flew to Nigeria soon after the incident, the police said, and spoke on the phone with Mr. Smollett while they were away. Upon their return to Chicago on Feb. 13, they were met by investigators and detained for two days.</p>\n<p>Commander Wodnicki said that a lawyer for the brothers, Gloria Schmidt, came to him and said: &ldquo;You really need to talk to these guys. I&rsquo;m going to allow them to give you a video interview with us present and we&rsquo;re going to have you hear their story. They are not offenders. They are victims.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The men acknowledged being paid to participate in the reported assault, the investigators said. They said Mr. Smollett had been upset that people he worked with had not taken the threatening letter he received seriously. In addition they said, according to the investigators&rsquo; account, Mr. Smollett had given them $100 to buy supplies for the attack, including the rope and a red hat that would resemble one worn by Trump supporters.</p>\n<p>While the brothers seemed to have punched Mr. Smollett, Superintendent Johnson said, &ldquo;As far as we can tell, the scratches and bruising that you saw in his face was most likely self-inflicted.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After the interview with the brothers, the detectives released them without charges. Asked about that decision, Superintendent Johnson said: &ldquo;Mr. Smollett is the one who orchestrated this crime. They became cooperating witnesses.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Almost from the beginning there was some skepticism about Mr. Smollett&rsquo;s account. It grew as time progressed, though the police for weeks insisted that the actor was being viewed as a victim. Mr. Smollett acknowledged the suspicions in his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/arts/jussie-smollett-attack.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fsopan-deb\">first public statement</a> about the incident, on Feb. 1, when he said, through his publicist: &ldquo;I am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/arts/television/jussie-smollett-interview.html\">Good Morning America</a>&rdquo; interview, broadcast on Feb. 14, Mr. Smollett said: &ldquo;It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>[Read more about </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/arts/television/jussie-smollett-interview.html\"><em>the &ldquo;Good Morning America&rdquo; interview</em></a><em>.]</em></p>\n<p>Those kinds of appeals for public sympathy appeared to particularly irk Superintendent Johnson.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Absolute justice would be an apology to this city that he smeared,&rdquo; he said at the news conference.</p>",

                "text": "Kamil Krzaczynski/Associated Press\nCHICAGO \u2014 Jussie Smollett, upset by his salary and seeking publicity, staged a fake assault a week after writing himself a threatening letter, the Chicago police said Thursday after the \u201cEmpire\u201d actor surrendered to face a felony charge of filing a false police report.\nThe Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson, visibly angry at a morning news conference, said Mr. Smollett had taken advantage of the pain and anger of racism, draining resources that could have been used to investigate other crimes for which people were actually suffering.\n[Read more: Jussie Smollett returns to work on \u201cEmpire\u201d after his arrest.]\n\u201cI just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention,\u201d he said, referring to the news media.\nAt an afternoon bail hearing, a judge set Mr. Smollett\u2019s bond at $100,000. He was released late Thursday afternoon after posting bond and returned to the \u201cEmpire\u201d set in Chicago where the show is being shot.\nIn Thursday\u2019s proceedings, members of Mr. Smollett\u2019s family were in the courtroom with him as the judge, John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr., said that he found the investigators\u2019 account of the incident disturbing, particularly the assertion that Mr. Smollett had used a rope around his neck to heighten outrage.\n\u201cWe live in a country where you are presumed innocent,\u201d the judge said. \u201cHowever, if these allegations are true, I find them utterly outrageous. Especially the violent, despicable use of a noose, which conjures such evil in our country.\u201d\nMr. Smollett, wearing a black puffer jacket, did not react, though occasionally he whispered to his legal team during the 25-minute proceeding. One of the lawyers, Jack Prior, agreed that the police account was outrageous, but he said it also was not true.\n\u201cHe wants nothing more than to clear his name,\u201d Mr. Prior said of his client.\nLater on Thursday, Mr. Smollett\u2019s legal team released a statement saying the court system had trampled \u201cthe presumption of innocence\u201d in a \u201claw enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.\u201d\nIt said that Mr. Smollett \u201cfeels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.\u201d\nThe police say Mr. Smollett hired two brothers to carry out the assault and paid them $3,500. They have a copy of the check used to pay them, the police said. Also recovered, they said, were phone records that showed Mr. Smollett speaking to the brothers an hour before the incident took place, and then an hour after.\nIn a document prepared for the bail hearing, prosecutors said they had video of the brothers at the scene, text messages they shared with Mr. Smollett and their testimony as to how Mr. Smollett had recruited them for the plan. He even had them visit the scene of what investigators contend was the fake attack, a spot near his home, on an earlier night to prepare, prosecutors said.\nBut, the prosecutor\u2019s document said, a video camera at the spot that Mr. Smollett had hoped would capture a phony attack was pointed in the wrong direction.\nSuperintendent Johnson declined to indicate why investigators now believe that Mr. Smollett had also played the chief role in mailing himself a threatening letter. The letter, which arrived a week before the reported assault, contained a white powder (crushed ibuprofen) and a sketch of what appeared to be a man being hanged and phrases, including \u201cYou will die.\u201d The return address said \u201cMAGA,\u201d a reference to a slogan from the Trump campaign.\nMr. Johnson referred further comment about the letter to the F.B.I., which is investigating that part of the case. The agency declined to comment.\nThe actor, who surrendered to the authorities on Thursday morning, has insisted the attack occurred and that he has not done anything wrong. The felony disorderly conduct charge he faces carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison.\nAfter his arrest, the reversal in public opinion for Mr. Smollett was quick and damaging. The report of the attack spurred a national outpouring of support, including from Democratic presidential candidates and President Trump, who called the incident \u201chorrible.\u201d\n[Read more about Jussie Smollett\u2019s life and career.]\nOn Thursday, some of the celebrities who had initially supported Mr. Smollett began taking down their social media posts from the aftermath of the attack.\nMr. Trump said in a post on Twitter, \u201c.@JussieSmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA.\u201d\nFox, the network that airs \u201cEmpire,\u201d released a statement Thursday saying it was evaluating the situation and the network\u2019s options. \u201cWe understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process,\u201d the statement said. Network executives later confirmed that among those options was that he return to the set and resume work as Jamal Lyon.\nMr. Smollett\u2019s official salary has not been made public, but he reportedly earned between $65,000 and $100,000 an episode on \u201cEmpire.\u201d It was not immediately apparent whether he has had any clashes with executives at Fox, who, as recently as Wednesday, issued a statement highly supportive of the actor, calling him a \u201cconsummate professional.\u201d\nAt their news conference and the bail hearing, police and prosecutors unveiled much of what they had uncovered about the reported attack. Mr. Smollett, 36, who is black and openly gay, had told the police that at roughly 2 a.m. on Jan. 29, two masked men attacked him on the 300 block of Lower East North Water Street in downtown Chicago. He said his assailants directed homophobic and racial slurs at him, put a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him. Mr. Smollett said the assault occurred after he went to pick up food.\nA detective commander, Edward Wodnicki, said at the news conference that investigators interviewed Mr. Smollett at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and found he had scratches on his face, some bruising, but no serious injuries.\nThe investigators approached the case as a possible hate crime, but had difficulty finding evidence to match Mr. Smollett\u2019s account. The attack itself was not visible on surveillance cameras.\nDays into their inquiry, investigators released a surveillance image of two men thought to be potential persons of interest, now known to be the two brothers who have said they helped stage a fake attack.\nPolice said they had spotted the brothers on surveillance footage that showed them taking a cab from the area of the reported assault. Investigators tracked the cab, interviewed the driver, and identified the passengers as Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, associates of Mr. Smollett\u2019s.\nBoth had worked as extras on \u201cEmpire\u201d and Mr. Smollett later acknowledged that he had paid to have one of them train him for a music video. Prosecutors said one of the brothers had sometimes supplied him with designer drugs.\nThe men flew to Nigeria soon after the incident, the police said, and spoke on the phone with Mr. Smollett while they were away. Upon their return to Chicago on Feb. 13, they were met by investigators and detained for two days.\nCommander Wodnicki said that a lawyer for the brothers, Gloria Schmidt, came to him and said: \u201cYou really need to talk to these guys. I\u2019m going to allow them to give you a video interview with us present and we\u2019re going to have you hear their story. They are not offenders. They are victims.\u201d\nThe men acknowledged being paid to participate in the reported assault, the investigators said. They said Mr. Smollett had been upset that people he worked with had not taken the threatening letter he received seriously. In addition they said, according to the investigators\u2019 account, Mr. Smollett had given them $100 to buy supplies for the attack, including the rope and a red hat that would resemble one worn by Trump supporters.\nWhile the brothers seemed to have punched Mr. Smollett, Superintendent Johnson said, \u201cAs far as we can tell, the scratches and bruising that you saw in his face was most likely self-inflicted.\u201d\nAfter the interview with the brothers, the detectives released them without charges. Asked about that decision, Superintendent Johnson said: \u201cMr. Smollett is the one who orchestrated this crime. They became cooperating witnesses.\u201d\nAlmost from the beginning there was some skepticism about Mr. Smollett\u2019s account. It grew as time progressed, though the police for weeks insisted that the actor was being viewed as a victim. Mr. Smollett acknowledged the suspicions in his first public statement about the incident, on Feb. 1, when he said, through his publicist: \u201cI am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.\u201d\nIn a \u201cGood Morning America\u201d interview, broadcast on Feb. 14, Mr. Smollett said: \u201cIt feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more.\u201d\n[Read more about the \u201cGood Morning America\u201d interview.]\nThose kinds of appeals for public sympathy appeared to particularly irk Superintendent Johnson.\n\u201cAbsolute justice would be an apology to this city that he smeared,\u201d he said at the news conference.",

Sure, there is still a lot of activity, including <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/17/politics/cambridge-analytica-director-special-counsel/index.html\">subpoenas</a>, flying around, but that shouldn&rsquo;t stop Mr. Mueller.</p>\n<p>The report is unlikely to be a dictionary-thick tome, which will disappoint some observers. But such brevity is not necessarily good news for the president. In fact, quite the opposite.</p>\n<p>For months, the president&rsquo;s lawyers have tried to discredit Mr. Mueller and this report, but their efforts may have backfired. A concise Mueller report might act as a &ldquo;road map&rdquo; to investigation for the Democratic House of Representatives &mdash; and it might also lead to further criminal investigation by other prosecutors. A short Mueller report would mark the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end.</p>\n<p>The report is unlikely to be lengthy by design: The special counsel regulations, which I had the privilege of drafting in 1999, envision a report that is concise, &ldquo;a summary&rdquo; of what he found. And Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s mandate is limited: to look into criminal activity and counterintelligence matters surrounding Russia and the 2016 election, as well as any obstruction of justice relating to those investigations.</p>\n<p>The regulations require the attorney general to give Congress a report, too. The regulations speak of the need for public confidence in the administration of justice and even have a <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.9\">provision </a>for public release of the attorney general&rsquo;s report. In a world where Mr. Mueller was the only investigator, the pressure for a comprehensive report to the public would be overwhelming.</p>\n<p>This is where the &ldquo;witch hunt&rdquo; attacks on Mr. Mueller may have backfired. For 19 months, Mr. Trump and his team have had one target to shoot at, and that target has had limited jurisdiction. But now the investigation resembles the architecture of the internet, with many different nodes, and some of those nodes possess potentially unlimited jurisdiction. Their powers and scope go well beyond Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s circumscribed mandate; they go to Mr. Trump&rsquo;s judgment and whether he lied to the American people. They also include law enforcement investigations having nothing to do with Russia, such as whether the president directed the commission of serious campaign finance crimes, as federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have already stated in filings. These are all critical matters, each with serious factual predicates already uncovered by prosecutors.</p>\n<p>Had Mr. Trump and his coterie done nothing wrong, they would have had little to fear from the special counsel, and a report from Mr. Mueller that cleared him would be the gold seal of approval. But Mr. Trump&rsquo;s behavior, including his dangling of pardons to witnesses in the investigation, makes total exoneration unlikely, even though it is enormously difficult to prosecute crimes with international dimensions and assertions of privilege. The investigation has been further clouded by the fact that people in Mr. Trump&rsquo;s inner circle lied repeatedly when it came to Russia (that long list includes Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone).</p>\n<p>Sure, it is at least possible to envision the special counsel resolving each strand of the investigation and making such information public in detail. But it is also quite possible &mdash; and more likely &mdash; to think that the president&rsquo;s bashing of Mr. Mueller may induce him to issue a more limited, by-the-book report, which will spawn further investigation. And the bashing may have encouraged Mr. Mueller to turn matters over to other investigators who have not been subject to the same sorts of public attack.</p>\n<p>The House of Representatives has already begun its investigation. To understand the dangers Mr. Trump may face in the aftermath of a limited Mueller report, consider the request Congress made in 1974 to the special prosecutor Leon Jaworski as it opened an impeachment inquiry. Mr. Jaworski is analogous to Mr. Mueller &mdash; indeed, his appointment was a model for the special counsel regulations. In March 1974, Peter Rodino, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote to Mr. Jaworski, requesting all information he had uncovered in his investigation. Mr. Rodino understood that Mr. Jaworski&rsquo;s mandate was far more limited than the House&rsquo;s, and <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-old-watergate-document-can-teach-house-judiciary-committee\">his letter</a> stated that &ldquo;it would be unthinkable if this material were kept from the House of Representatives in the course of the discharge of its most awesome constitutional responsibility.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Of course, there is no open impeachment inquiry now. But that could quickly change if Mr. Mueller writes a report that is anything less than a full clearing of the president: Congress would be under a constitutional obligation to investigate the facts for itself. Congress cannot be satisfied that impeachable offenses were not committed when Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s investigative mandate did not cover many impeachable offenses, and when his report does not provide detailed information and answers to the few offenses that are within his mandate. This is where Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s &ldquo;by the book&rdquo; behavior may be initially unsatisfying to Mr. Trump&rsquo;s critics but ultimately more threatening to the president in the long run.</p>\n<p>The overlapping investigations by different entities, housed in different branches of government, spanning geography and even different governments (such as the New York attorney general&rsquo;s investigation into the Trump Foundation), make it difficult for anyone, even Attorney General Barr, to end the inquiries.</p>\n<p>This news may be disappointing, for various reasons, to the president&rsquo;s critics and supporters alike. But the ultimate result is a good one. It means the truth is likely to come out &mdash; maybe not on the timetable anyone wants, but it will. So whenever Mr. Mueller turns in his report, do not assume that things are over. Like &ldquo;The king is dead, long live the King,&rdquo; the investigations here serve a purpose that transcends any one individual or law enforcement entity. This is the architecture of our Constitution, which is designed to ferret out high-level wrongdoing through a variety of channels for the American public to see.</p>\n<p>Neal K.

                "text": "Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nThe special counsel Robert Mueller will apparently soon turn in a report to the new attorney general, William Barr. Sure, there is still a lot of activity, including subpoenas, flying around, but that shouldn\u2019t stop Mr. Mueller.\nThe report is unlikely to be a dictionary-thick tome, which will disappoint some observers. But such brevity is not necessarily good news for the president. In fact, quite the opposite.\nFor months, the president\u2019s lawyers have tried to discredit Mr. Mueller and this report, but their efforts may have backfired. A concise Mueller report might act as a \u201croad map\u201d to investigation for the Democratic House of Representatives \u2014 and it might also lead to further criminal investigation by other prosecutors. A short Mueller report would mark the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end.\nThe report is unlikely to be lengthy by design: The special counsel regulations, which I had the privilege of drafting in 1999, envision a report that is concise, \u201ca summary\u201d of what he found. And Mr. Mueller\u2019s mandate is limited: to look into criminal activity and counterintelligence matters surrounding Russia and the 2016 election, as well as any obstruction of justice relating to those investigations.\nThe regulations require the attorney general to give Congress a report, too. The regulations speak of the need for public confidence in the administration of justice and even have a provision for public release of the attorney general\u2019s report. In a world where Mr. Mueller was the only investigator, the pressure for a comprehensive report to the public would be overwhelming.\nThis is where the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d attacks on Mr. Mueller may have backfired. For 19 months, Mr. Trump and his team have had one target to shoot at, and that target has had limited jurisdiction. But now the investigation resembles the architecture of the internet, with many different nodes, and some of those nodes possess potentially unlimited jurisdiction. Their powers and scope go well beyond Mr. Mueller\u2019s circumscribed mandate; they go to Mr. Trump\u2019s judgment and whether he lied to the American people. They also include law enforcement investigations having nothing to do with Russia, such as whether the president directed the commission of serious campaign finance crimes, as federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have already stated in filings. These are all critical matters, each with serious factual predicates already uncovered by prosecutors.\nHad Mr. Trump and his coterie done nothing wrong, they would have had little to fear from the special counsel, and a report from Mr. Mueller that cleared him would be the gold seal of approval. But Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior, including his dangling of pardons to witnesses in the investigation, makes total exoneration unlikely, even though it is enormously difficult to prosecute crimes with international dimensions and assertions of privilege. The investigation has been further clouded by the fact that people in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle lied repeatedly when it came to Russia (that long list includes Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone).\nSure, it is at least possible to envision the special counsel resolving each strand of the investigation and making such information public in detail. But it is also quite possible \u2014 and more likely \u2014 to think that the president\u2019s bashing of Mr. Mueller may induce him to issue a more limited, by-the-book report, which will spawn further investigation. And the bashing may have encouraged Mr. Mueller to turn matters over to other investigators who have not been subject to the same sorts of public attack.\nThe House of Representatives has already begun its investigation. To understand the dangers Mr. Trump may face in the aftermath of a limited Mueller report, consider the request Congress made in 1974 to the special prosecutor Leon Jaworski as it opened an impeachment inquiry. Mr. Jaworski is analogous to Mr. Mueller \u2014 indeed, his appointment was a model for the special counsel regulations. In March 1974, Peter Rodino, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote to Mr. Jaworski, requesting all information he had uncovered in his investigation. Mr. Rodino understood that Mr. Jaworski\u2019s mandate was far more limited than the House\u2019s, and his letter stated that \u201cit would be unthinkable if this material were kept from the House of Representatives in the course of the discharge of its most awesome constitutional responsibility.\u201d\nOf course, there is no open impeachment inquiry now. But that could quickly change if Mr. Mueller writes a report that is anything less than a full clearing of the president: Congress would be under a constitutional obligation to investigate the facts for itself. Congress cannot be satisfied that impeachable offenses were not committed when Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigative mandate did not cover many impeachable offenses, and when his report does not provide detailed information and answers to the few offenses that are within his mandate. This is where Mr. Mueller\u2019s \u201cby the book\u201d behavior may be initially unsatisfying to Mr. Trump\u2019s critics but ultimately more threatening to the president in the long run.\nThe overlapping investigations by different entities, housed in different branches of government, spanning geography and even different governments (such as the New York attorney general\u2019s investigation into the Trump Foundation), make it difficult for anyone, even Attorney General Barr, to end the inquiries.\nThis news may be disappointing, for various reasons, to the president\u2019s critics and supporters alike. But the ultimate result is a good one. It means the truth is likely to come out \u2014 maybe not on the timetable anyone wants, but it will. So whenever Mr. Mueller turns in his report, do not assume that things are over. Like \u201cThe king is dead, long live the King,\u201d the investigations here serve a purpose that transcends any one individual or law enforcement entity. This is the architecture of our Constitution, which is designed to ferret out high-level wrongdoing through a variety of channels for the American public to see.\nNeal K.

                "html": "<p>JUPITER, Fla. &mdash; Robert K. Kraft, the billionaire owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, was charged on Friday with two counts of soliciting sex as part of a wide-ranging investigation into prostitution and suspected human trafficking in South Florida.</p>\n<p>The charges against Mr. Kraft, 77, in Jupiter, Fla., came after the police used video surveillance to observe activity inside several day spas and massage parlors. The police said that the parlors had been used for prostitution and that many of the women involved were considered to be victims.</p>\n<p>The investigation involved several law enforcement agencies and resulted in raids and arrests connected to nearly a dozen businesses in the region. At least one person was charged with human trafficking; others, including several women, are accused of racketeering and money laundering. More than two dozen customers, men ranging in age from their 30s to at least one in his 80s, have been arrested; hundreds have been charged, the police said.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Mr. Kraft and the Patriots released a statement, saying: &ldquo;We categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity. Because it is a judicial matter, we will not be commenting further.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Kraft is the most prominent name to emerge in the case, and the charges represent an embarrassing spectacle for a man who has become one of the most powerful owners in American sports. His Patriots have played in 10 Super Bowls since he bought the team, winning six times. He is a leading voice in the N.F.L.&rsquo;s small fraternity of billionaire owners, a member of the committee that sets Commissioner Roger Goodell&rsquo;s salary and a friend and political benefactor of President Trump.</p>\n<p>In addition, the legal problems may place Mr. Goodell in the uncomfortable position of having to mete out some kind of punishment for the personal conduct of a man who is essentially one of his bosses.</p>\n<p>The N.F.L.&rsquo;s constitution gives Mr. Goodell broad authority to hold players and owners accountable for conduct he deems detrimental to the league. Previous punishments have included <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/sports/football/nfl-suspends-colts-owner-jim-irsay-for-six-games.html\">fines and suspensions</a>, which prohibit owners from being at their team facilities or attending games.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The N.F.L. is aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developments,&rdquo; the league said in a statement.</p>\n<p>As the league commissioner in 1999, Paul Tagliabue fined Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., who owned the San Francisco 49ers, $1 million and suspended him for a season after he pleaded guilty for failing to report a felony arising from a gambling fraud and extortion case. More recently, Mr. Goodell suspended Jim Irsay, the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, who has battled substance abuse, for six games and fined him $500,000 after he pleaded guilty to driving while impaired.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Orchids of Asia spa in Jupiter, Fla.\" sizes=\"((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/23/sports/23kraft-2-print/merlin_151063131_ceaf71c3-a2b1-4d48-ab02-3afbc8b7cf33-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/23/sports/23kraft-2-print/merlin_151063131_ceaf71c3-a2b1-4d48-ab02-3afbc8b7cf33-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/23/sports/23kraft-2-print/merlin_151063131_ceaf71c3-a2b1-4d48-ab02-3afbc8b7cf33-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/23/sports/23kraft-2-print/merlin_151063131_ceaf71c3-a2b1-4d48-ab02-3afbc8b7cf33-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 2048w\"></img></figure>\n<p>The case involving Mr. Kraft is more complicated. He has been charged with two misdemeanors, not felonies, and those charges may be reduced or dropped. But Mr. Goodell has long portrayed himself as the defender of the league&rsquo;s reputation, and he has penalized players and owners for a host of offenses, some of which might have been little noticed years earlier.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kraft is accused of patronizing a spa in Jupiter called Orchids of Asia, a small storefront business in a strip mall that also includes a nail salon, a surf shop and a Thai restaurant. The police said Mr. Kraft had visited twice, dropped off by a driver. The mall, anchored on one end by an Outback Steakhouse, is near lushly landscaped gated communities, a half-dozen golf courses and the spring training home of the Miami Marlins and the St. Louis Cardinals.</p>\n<p>All of the sexual encounters that have resulted in charges were videotaped as part of the prostitution investigation, the police said. Investigators, who have been conducting surveillance of massage parlors in the area for six months, charged &ldquo;nearly 200&rdquo; people, though only a fraction have been arrested so far.</p>\n<p>For years, Mr. Kraft has been considered a kind of first among equals in the ranks of the 32 N.F.L. owners. He has led the league&rsquo;s powerful broadcast and finance committees and has often touted his status as a confidant to Mr. Goodell. Within owner and executive circles, he is known as &ldquo;the assistant commissioner,&rdquo; with no small hint of resentment.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kraft had fashioned himself as a kind of ordinary Patriots fan who in the 1970s sat with his sons in the frigid bleachers of Section 217 of what was originally called Schaefer Stadium. He made his fortune in the paper and packaging business and purchased the land adjacent to the stadium complex in the 1980s, and eventually bought the stadium itself.</p>\n<p>That positioned Mr. Kraft to buy the Patriots in 1994 after James Orthwein put the team up for sale. Other bidders included Stan Kroenke, the current owner of the Los Angeles Rams, and Mr. Trump, at the time a businessman and the former owner of the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kraft paid $172 million for the Patriots, the highest price paid for an N.F.L. team at the time. His public identification with the Patriots, the N.F.L.&rsquo;s pre-eminent 21st century dynasty, has given Mr. Kraft entree into a world of celebrity friends, beautiful young women, Hollywood award spectacles and high-roller events.</p>\n<p>The team won its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/sports/super-bowl-patriots-rams.html\">sixth Super Bowl title</a> on Feb. 3, defeating the Los Angeles Rams, 13-3, in Atlanta. The team has sold out every regular-season and exhibition game since 1994 and sits near the top of the league in revenue. Mr. Kraft attended the N.B.A. All-Star Game festivities last weekend in Charlotte, N.C., where he hobnobbed courtside with LeBron James while wearing a diamond &ldquo;Championships&rdquo; necklace that the rapper Meek Mill had given him at a Super Bowl after-party.</p>\n<p>In 2017, Mr. Kraft attended a private dinner with Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump&rsquo;s club in Palm Beach, Fla.</p>\n<p>Friends said Mr. Kraft was set adrift after the death from cancer of Myra Kraft, his wife of nearly five decades, in 2011.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I cried myself to sleep every night for a year after my wife died, until I met my girlfriend,&rdquo; Mr. Kraft said in a 2017 interview. The girlfriend was Ricki Noel Lander, an actress and dancer who then was in her early 30s and whom Mr. Kraft has been dating off and on since.</p>\n<p>While Mr. Kraft lives in Massachusetts, he has owned property in Palm Beach, Fla., for a number of years.</p>\n<p>By early Friday afternoon, the Orchids of Asia day spa had become an impromptu tourist attraction, drawing onlookers who peered into its darkened glass facade and posed for pictures in front of the closed business. An orange sign posted on the door by the town&rsquo;s building department and dated Tuesday, reading &ldquo;DANGER,&rdquo; warned that occupying the unit was prohibited.</p>\n<p>Linda Perry of Jupiter Island said she had been driving into the neighborhood for lunch when news of Mr. Kraft&rsquo;s arrest broke.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I looked it up and we decided to come here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just so mind-boggling.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/9882718de6c458141c68f5778733f399c654a072?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F74%2F98%2F64c708b942ac9a24ed0e40f57db0%2Fhua-pc.pdf&userId=3621650&signature=e18d39a53a51f4ab\">affidavit of probable cause</a> filed by the Jupiter police laid out how the men had come to be charged for what went on inside the spa.</p>\n<p>Acting on a tip from law enforcement personnel in nearby Martin County last summer, the police began their investigation by searching online reviews for the business, several of which used a slang term for a sex act that was available to male customers. After conducting 24-hour video surveillance in November, the police noticed that only male clients had entered, despite the spa&rsquo;s advertising some services primarily used by women.</p>\n<p>A Florida Department of Health investigator inspected the business on behalf of the police and noticed several indications that women were living there, including beds, dressers with personal items and a refrigerator containing food and condiments.</p>\n<p>One day in January, the police stopped men leaving the spa in their vehicles. At the roadside, the men told police officers that they had taken part in sex acts during their visits. Using that information, the police obtained a search warrant allowing them to monitor and record conduct inside the spa on video. For five days, starting on Jan. 18, the police monitored the video, and they said they had observed more than 20 men receiving manual or oral stimulation during massage sessions. In none of the instances, the police said, did they observe sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p>At Goodfella&rsquo;s Pizza several doors down, the owner, Joseph Bompartito, said he had been working late waiting for a delivery on Jan. 17 when, at about 11:30 p.m., a swarm of police cars pulled up to the mall and evacuated the massage parlor, claiming there was a suspicious package and a possible bomb threat. But officers did not evacuate any other businesses in the strip mall, which made Mr. Bompartito suspect that something unlawful was going on at the massage parlor. Now, he said, he thinks that was when the police might have planted video cameras inside, a conclusion backed up by the police timeline released on Friday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If it was a real bomb scare, why wouldn&rsquo;t they have evacuated the rest of the mall?&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Bompartito, who moved to South Florida from Philadelphia seven months ago, said that around the time of the purported bomb scare, he saw young women leave the massage parlor around lunchtime every day and walk around the mall, without talking to anyone or eating anything. He had worked next door to a day spa in Philadelphia that had been raided by the police and sensed something was wrong here, too.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They looked malnourished,&rdquo; he said of the women from Orchids of Asia. &ldquo;One I even offered a slice of pizza to. She wouldn&rsquo;t even say hi, wouldn&rsquo;t even say thank you.

                "text": "JUPITER, Fla. \u2014 Robert K. Kraft, the billionaire owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, was charged on Friday with two counts of soliciting sex as part of a wide-ranging investigation into prostitution and suspected human trafficking in South Florida.\nThe charges against Mr. Kraft, 77, in Jupiter, Fla., came after the police used video surveillance to observe activity inside several day spas and massage parlors. The police said that the parlors had been used for prostitution and that many of the women involved were considered to be victims.\nThe investigation involved several law enforcement agencies and resulted in raids and arrests connected to nearly a dozen businesses in the region. At least one person was charged with human trafficking; others, including several women, are accused of racketeering and money laundering. More than two dozen customers, men ranging in age from their 30s to at least one in his 80s, have been arrested; hundreds have been charged, the police said.\nA spokesman for Mr. Kraft and the Patriots released a statement, saying: \u201cWe categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity. Because it is a judicial matter, we will not be commenting further.\u201d\nMr. Kraft is the most prominent name to emerge in the case, and the charges represent an embarrassing spectacle for a man who has become one of the most powerful owners in American sports. His Patriots have played in 10 Super Bowls since he bought the team, winning six times. He is a leading voice in the N.F.L.\u2019s small fraternity of billionaire owners, a member of the committee that sets Commissioner Roger Goodell\u2019s salary and a friend and political benefactor of President Trump.\nIn addition, the legal problems may place Mr. Goodell in the uncomfortable position of having to mete out some kind of punishment for the personal conduct of a man who is essentially one of his bosses.\nThe N.F.L.\u2019s constitution gives Mr. Goodell broad authority to hold players and owners accountable for conduct he deems detrimental to the league. Previous punishments have included fines and suspensions, which prohibit owners from being at their team facilities or attending games.\n\u201cThe N.F.L. is aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developments,\u201d the league said in a statement.\nAs the league commissioner in 1999, Paul Tagliabue fined Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., who owned the San Francisco 49ers, $1 million and suspended him for a season after he pleaded guilty for failing to report a felony arising from a gambling fraud and extortion case. More recently, Mr. Goodell suspended Jim Irsay, the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, who has battled substance abuse, for six games and fined him $500,000 after he pleaded guilty to driving while impaired.\nThe case involving Mr. Kraft is more complicated. He has been charged with two misdemeanors, not felonies, and those charges may be reduced or dropped. But Mr. Goodell has long portrayed himself as the defender of the league\u2019s reputation, and he has penalized players and owners for a host of offenses, some of which might have been little noticed years earlier.\nMr. Kraft is accused of patronizing a spa in Jupiter called Orchids of Asia, a small storefront business in a strip mall that also includes a nail salon, a surf shop and a Thai restaurant. The police said Mr. Kraft had visited twice, dropped off by a driver. The mall, anchored on one end by an Outback Steakhouse, is near lushly landscaped gated communities, a half-dozen golf courses and the spring training home of the Miami Marlins and the St. Louis Cardinals.\nAll of the sexual encounters that have resulted in charges were videotaped as part of the prostitution investigation, the police said. Investigators, who have been conducting surveillance of massage parlors in the area for six months, charged \u201cnearly 200\u201d people, though only a fraction have been arrested so far.\nFor years, Mr. Kraft has been considered a kind of first among equals in the ranks of the 32 N.F.L. owners. He has led the league\u2019s powerful broadcast and finance committees and has often touted his status as a confidant to Mr. Goodell. Within owner and executive circles, he is known as \u201cthe assistant commissioner,\u201d with no small hint of resentment.\nMr. Kraft had fashioned himself as a kind of ordinary Patriots fan who in the 1970s sat with his sons in the frigid bleachers of Section 217 of what was originally called Schaefer Stadium. He made his fortune in the paper and packaging business and purchased the land adjacent to the stadium complex in the 1980s, and eventually bought the stadium itself.\nThat positioned Mr. Kraft to buy the Patriots in 1994 after James Orthwein put the team up for sale. Other bidders included Stan Kroenke, the current owner of the Los Angeles Rams, and Mr. Trump, at the time a businessman and the former owner of the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League.\nMr. Kraft paid $172 million for the Patriots, the highest price paid for an N.F.L. team at the time. His public identification with the Patriots, the N.F.L.\u2019s pre-eminent 21st century dynasty, has given Mr. Kraft entree into a world of celebrity friends, beautiful young women, Hollywood award spectacles and high-roller events.\nThe team won its sixth Super Bowl title on Feb. 3, defeating the Los Angeles Rams, 13-3, in Atlanta. The team has sold out every regular-season and exhibition game since 1994 and sits near the top of the league in revenue. Mr. Kraft attended the N.B.A. All-Star Game festivities last weekend in Charlotte, N.C., where he hobnobbed courtside with LeBron James while wearing a diamond \u201cChampionships\u201d necklace that the rapper Meek Mill had given him at a Super Bowl after-party.\nIn 2017, Mr. Kraft attended a private dinner with Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s club in Palm Beach, Fla.\nFriends said Mr. Kraft was set adrift after the death from cancer of Myra Kraft, his wife of nearly five decades, in 2011.\n\u201cI cried myself to sleep every night for a year after my wife died, until I met my girlfriend,\u201d Mr. Kraft said in a 2017 interview. The girlfriend was Ricki Noel Lander, an actress and dancer who then was in her early 30s and whom Mr. Kraft has been dating off and on since.\nWhile Mr. Kraft lives in Massachusetts, he has owned property in Palm Beach, Fla., for a number of years.\nBy early Friday afternoon, the Orchids of Asia day spa had become an impromptu tourist attraction, drawing onlookers who peered into its darkened glass facade and posed for pictures in front of the closed business. An orange sign posted on the door by the town\u2019s building department and dated Tuesday, reading \u201cDANGER,\u201d warned that occupying the unit was prohibited.\nLinda Perry of Jupiter Island said she had been driving into the neighborhood for lunch when news of Mr. Kraft\u2019s arrest broke.\n\u201cI looked it up and we decided to come here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just so mind-boggling.\u201d\nAn affidavit of probable cause filed by the Jupiter police laid out how the men had come to be charged for what went on inside the spa.\nActing on a tip from law enforcement personnel in nearby Martin County last summer, the police began their investigation by searching online reviews for the business, several of which used a slang term for a sex act that was available to male customers. After conducting 24-hour video surveillance in November, the police noticed that only male clients had entered, despite the spa\u2019s advertising some services primarily used by women.\nA Florida Department of Health investigator inspected the business on behalf of the police and noticed several indications that women were living there, including beds, dressers with personal items and a refrigerator containing food and condiments.\nOne day in January, the police stopped men leaving the spa in their vehicles. At the roadside, the men told police officers that they had taken part in sex acts during their visits. Using that information, the police obtained a search warrant allowing them to monitor and record conduct inside the spa on video. For five days, starting on Jan. 18, the police monitored the video, and they said they had observed more than 20 men receiving manual or oral stimulation during massage sessions. In none of the instances, the police said, did they observe sexual intercourse.\nAt Goodfella\u2019s Pizza several doors down, the owner, Joseph Bompartito, said he had been working late waiting for a delivery on Jan. 17 when, at about 11:30 p.m., a swarm of police cars pulled up to the mall and evacuated the massage parlor, claiming there was a suspicious package and a possible bomb threat. But officers did not evacuate any other businesses in the strip mall, which made Mr. Bompartito suspect that something unlawful was going on at the massage parlor. Now, he said, he thinks that was when the police might have planted video cameras inside, a conclusion backed up by the police timeline released on Friday.\n\u201cIf it was a real bomb scare, why wouldn\u2019t they have evacuated the rest of the mall?\u201d he said.\nMr. Bompartito, who moved to South Florida from Philadelphia seven months ago, said that around the time of the purported bomb scare, he saw young women leave the massage parlor around lunchtime every day and walk around the mall, without talking to anyone or eating anything. He had worked next door to a day spa in Philadelphia that had been raided by the police and sensed something was wrong here, too.\n\u201cThey looked malnourished,\u201d he said of the women from Orchids of Asia. \u201cOne I even offered a slice of pizza to. She wouldn\u2019t even say hi, wouldn\u2019t even say thank you. Just kept her head down.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, one of the women he recognized was taken away by the police in handcuffs, he said.",

But once onboard, he delivered the grim news: He had fumbled the plastic eating utensils before reaching the gate, and the crew did not have any forks on such a short flight.</p>\n<p>What happened next was typical: Ms. Klobuchar berated her aide instantly for the slip-up. What happened after that was not: She pulled a comb from her bag and began eating the salad with it, according to four people familiar with the episode.</p>\n<p>Then she handed the comb to her staff member with a directive: Clean it.</p>\n<p><em>[Read more: </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-president-2020.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article\"><em>Amy Klobuchar enters 2020 presidential race.</em></a><em>]</em></p>\n<p>The moment &mdash; an abridged version of which Ms. Klobuchar recounted herself in a speech to fellow Democrats at the time &mdash; encapsulates the underside of life on the Minnesota senator&rsquo;s team, detailed in interviews with more than two dozen former staff members and internal emails reviewed by The New York Times. As Ms. Klobuchar <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-president-2020.html\">joins the 2020 presidential race</a>, many of these former aides say she was not just demanding but often dehumanizing &mdash; not merely a tough boss in a capital full of them but the steward of a work environment colored by volatility, highhandedness and distrust.</p>\n<p>The senator feared sabotage from her own team: In an email, she once raised the prospect of an in-house mole. She and her top confidantes could complicate the future job opportunities of some staff members who sought to leave, former aides said, sometimes speaking to their would-be employers to register her displeasure. And Ms. Klobuchar frequently suggested that her aides were preventing her from greater standing in Washington and beyond, former staff members said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are becoming a joke,&rdquo; she wrote in one email about the contents of her Twitter feed, &ldquo;and it is making me a joke.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Questions about Ms. Klobuchar&rsquo;s actions toward subordinates have shadowed the early days of her 2020 presidential campaign, with articles in <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-klobuchar-mistreat-staff-harry-reid_us_5c5db1ece4b03afe8d674530\">HuffPost</a> and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mollyhensleyclancy/amy-klobuchar-staff-2020-election\">BuzzFeed News</a> by turns fueling the hard-driving reputation that has followed her for years in Washington and angering supporters who see sexism in the criticism.</p>\n<p>Ms. Klobuchar, 58, has allowed that she has &ldquo;high expectations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Am I a tough boss sometimes? Yes,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/19/amy-klobuchar-difficult-management-leadership-style-new-hampshire-town-hall-sot-vpx.cnn\">she said</a> at a recent CNN forum. &ldquo;Have I pushed people too hard? Yes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Presented with a detailed accounting of The Times&rsquo; reporting and the staff emails written by Ms. Klobuchar, a campaign spokeswoman, Carlie Waibel, said: &ldquo;The senator has repeatedly acknowledged that she can be tough and push people hard. But these anonymous stories &mdash; some of which are just plain ridiculous &mdash; do not overshadow the countless experiences of people on the senator&rsquo;s team who she has been so proud to work with.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>[<em>Our Politics editor, Patrick Healy, will be responding to readers&rsquo; questions and feedback on our coverage of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Please leave your questions for him in the comments section.</em>]</p>\n<p>Despite employee turnover that perennially ranks near the highest in the Senate, Ms. Klobuchar has defenders among her former staff. She noted at the forum that some people had been with her for many years.</p>\n<p>Erikka Knuti, a former communications aide to the senator, described her experience as broadly positive and said Ms. Klobuchar could be contrite at times, remembering a gesture of regret from the senator once after she snapped at Ms. Knuti in an elevator in front of another lawmaker. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t O.K.,&rdquo; she recalled Ms. Klobuchar telling her. &ldquo;It made me feel valued,&rdquo; Ms. Knuti said.</p>\n<p>While there was wide consensus in the interviews that women were often held to a different standard as bosses, former aides &mdash; female and male &mdash; said their concerns about Ms. Klobuchar&rsquo;s behavior should not be dismissed as gender bias. Many of the aides said they had worked for both men and women, for lawmakers both compassionate and unkind, without encountering anyone else like Ms. Klobuchar.</p>\n<p>The world of congressional staffs is one of long hours and low pay, with much of the work shouldered by twentysomething junior aides who are learning on the job. Some members of Congress are notorious for round-the-clock phone calls, late-night email and fierce attention to their own press coverage. Ms. Klobuchar is among them, but former aides said they were especially troubled by her willingness &mdash; in excess of other senators&rsquo;, they said &mdash; to embarrass staff members over minor missteps or with odd requests.</p>\n<p>[<em>Make sense of the people, issues and ideas </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/politics?smid=rd?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article\"><em>shaping American politics with our newsletter.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Most of those interviewed for this article &mdash; describing memories that span from shortly after her election in 2006 to the much more recent past &mdash; discussed their time with Ms. Klobuchar on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the senator. These concerns were not idle, they said. Saving potentially damaging emails from Ms. Klobuchar became something of a last-day ritual, the aides said, in case they ever needed evidence of her conduct for their own reputational protection.</p>\n<p>She was known to throw office objects in frustration, including binders and phones, in the direction of aides, they said. Low-level employees were asked to perform duties they described as demeaning, like washing her dishes or other cleaning &mdash; a possible violation of Senate ethics rules, according to veterans of the chamber.</p>\n<p>Appraisals of perceived staff incompetence were delivered at all hours of the day and night:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In 20 years in politics I have never seen worse prep,&rdquo; Ms. Klobuchar said in one email, displeased at how a political event had been handled.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is the hands down worse thing you have ever given me,&rdquo; she wrote in another, questioning her team&rsquo;s grasp of policy as she rejected its &ldquo;slop.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is the worst press staff I ever had,&rdquo; she announced once to employees, according to an aide present. This was effectively a rite of passage, the aide said: The senator had plainly said the same about both predecessors and successors in the office.</p>\n<p>Still, while few contest that serving Ms. Klobuchar could be a challenge, other current and former aides spoke fondly of the experience, expressing pride over the national platform she has earned. The senator&rsquo;s defenders say her conduct must be viewed in the larger context of women in Washington, where male leaders with legendary tempers and famously exacting standards, like former President Bill Clinton, have long subsisted atop the political food chain.</p>\n<p>For Ms. Klobuchar, there is the added complication of tending to a campaign image premised on affable Midwestern common sense.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Minnesota nice&rsquo; thing is also kind of a double-edged sword,&rdquo; Ms. Knuti said. &ldquo;In the Midwest you have to be outwardly nice and congenial. But these are tough people. Male senators yell quite a bit. But if a woman yells at you, it&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;I got yelled at by my mom.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This much is not in dispute: For years, Ms. Klobuchar has had among the highest rates of staff turnover in the Senate, according to a review of congressional offices from the website LegiStorm. Over much of her Senate career, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-2020-election.html\">no one outpaced</a> Ms. Klobuchar on this score; in 2017, two freshman senators, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, <a href=\"https://www.legistorm.com/turnover/worst_bosses.html\">surpassed her</a>.</p>\n<p>The churn has produced a bit of a vicious circle. Democrats in Washington say she has struggled to recruit and retain top talent. Some operatives say they have shied away from her 2020 campaign, mindful of Ms. Klobuchar&rsquo;s reputation.</p>\n<p>Among other concerns, her office&rsquo;s paid parental leave policy has been described as unusual on Capitol Hill. Two people familiar with the policy said that those who took paid leave were effectively required, once they returned, to remain with the office for three times as many weeks as they had been gone. The policy, outlined in an employee handbook, called for those who left anyway to pay back money earned during the weeks they were on leave.</p>\n<p>After receiving questions about the policy from The Times, Ms. Klobuchar&rsquo;s office said it would be revised. &ldquo;We offer 12 weeks of paid maternity and paternity leave for our staff and have one of the strongest paid leave policies in the Senate,&rdquo; said a spokeswoman, Elana Ross. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never made staff pay back any of their leave and will be changing that language in the handbook.&rdquo; She declined to provide a copy of the current policy as written.</p>\n<p>Ms. Klobuchar&rsquo;s supporters say the office environment has never adversely affected her work, cheering her status as a bipartisan pragmatist with a solidly Democratic record and political instincts more moderate than many of her 2020 peers&rsquo;. They cite her status as a legislative advocate for major national causes like lower <a href=\"https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/2/klobuchar-judiciary-committee-senators-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-tackle-skyrocketing-prescription-drug-prices\">prescription drug prices</a> and more local issues like <a href=\"https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/events-speeches-and-floor-statements?ID=1F25C4B5-E350-428F-9D4E-A9BE2806A46E\">swimming pool safety</a> after a tragic accident in Minnesota.</p>\n<p>The senator can also be charming, funny and warm, they say &mdash; a fixture at staff weddings and birthday parties. Jonathan Becker, her former chief of staff, said that while Ms. Klobuchar could be tough, the intensity was &ldquo;exhilarating, too,&rdquo; compelling aides to raise their performance.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what the American people want in a president?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not looking for mashed potatoes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Others said that Ms. Klobuchar often squandered time and mental energy on trivial matters, obsessing over perceived snubs in news media clickbait about who was up or down in Washington and repeatedly suggesting that an inferior staff was standing in her way.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Senator Leahy, I&rsquo;m sure he doesn&rsquo;t put up with this,&rdquo; she once said of her colleague, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/senators/longest_serving_senators.htm\">longest-serving active senator</a>, according to a person present.</p>\n<p>Some former aides who were frequent targets of her ire acknowledged that the senator often had a point, praising her intelligence and political antenna. She has been re-elected in two landslides, including a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-minnesota-elections.html\">24-point victory</a> last year in a state President Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/minnesota\">lost narrowly</a>.</p>\n<p>But her blistering feedback to staff was often substantially out of proportion to the offense, these former aides said. Word choice or grammatical issues could make Ms. Klobuchar especially furious, not only in prepared text but also in office meetings or common speech. Words like &ldquo;straight-shooting&rdquo; and &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo; were known to invite her scorn. She urged staff members never to say that another senator &ldquo;led&rdquo; something and asked them to call her a &ldquo;co-sponsor&rdquo; of legislation instead of a supporter, suggesting that the latter sounded weak.</p>\n<p>Ms. Klobuchar&rsquo;s exasperation often appeared connected to two factors: an abiding fear of being embarrassed in front of colleagues or in the press and the conviction that she works harder than her staff.</p>\n<p>In one message, in which she said she had not been prepared properly for an event, Ms. Klobuchar reminded her team of the hours she kept.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t claim lack of time,&rdquo; she wrote, asking what else might explain their failure. &ldquo;I flew in at one in the morning. I don&rsquo;t have that luxury to blame lack of time. Unless YOU were up working at one am, and up again five am the next day, please don&rsquo;t claim lack of time. That was when I was up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In private, she could deliver slashing remarks without particular provocation. Parched one day in the Capitol, she turned to a member of her team and said, &ldquo;I would trade three of you for a bottle of water,&rdquo; according to a person who witnessed it.</p>\n<p>Former aides said Ms. Klobuchar frequently told them they were damaging her political career. On one occasion, a former aide recalled, Ms. Klobuchar accused her of &ldquo;ruining my marriage,&rdquo; too. (The aide said she interpreted the comment to mean that Ms. Klobuchar, in her telling, was forced to work overtime, away from family, to overcome the aide&rsquo;s failings.)</p>\n<p>Many staff members did warmly recall the misery-loves-company camaraderie that built among aggrieved aides. But the core truth of life with Ms. Klobuchar was never going to change, they said: She thought she was demanding their best and getting far less. And she was never going to apologize for pointing that out.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I need to do some serious soul searching about our office,&rdquo; she said in one email, lamenting the team&rsquo;s work product. &ldquo;How can you treat me like this time and time again?&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Erin Schaff for The New York Times\nSenator Amy Klobuchar was hungry, forkless and losing patience.\nAn aide, joining her on a trip to South Carolina in 2008, had procured a salad for his boss while hauling their bags through an airport terminal. But once onboard, he delivered the grim news: He had fumbled the plastic eating utensils before reaching the gate, and the crew did not have any forks on such a short flight.\nWhat happened next was typical: Ms. Klobuchar berated her aide instantly for the slip-up. What happened after that was not: She pulled a comb from her bag and began eating the salad with it, according to four people familiar with the episode.\nThen she handed the comb to her staff member with a directive: Clean it.\n[Read more: Amy Klobuchar enters 2020 presidential race.]\nThe moment \u2014 an abridged version of which Ms. Klobuchar recounted herself in a speech to fellow Democrats at the time \u2014 encapsulates the underside of life on the Minnesota senator\u2019s team, detailed in interviews with more than two dozen former staff members and internal emails reviewed by The New York Times. As Ms. Klobuchar joins the 2020 presidential race, many of these former aides say she was not just demanding but often dehumanizing \u2014 not merely a tough boss in a capital full of them but the steward of a work environment colored by volatility, highhandedness and distrust.\nThe senator feared sabotage from her own team: In an email, she once raised the prospect of an in-house mole. She and her top confidantes could complicate the future job opportunities of some staff members who sought to leave, former aides said, sometimes speaking to their would-be employers to register her displeasure. And Ms. Klobuchar frequently suggested that her aides were preventing her from greater standing in Washington and beyond, former staff members said.\n\u201cWe are becoming a joke,\u201d she wrote in one email about the contents of her Twitter feed, \u201cand it is making me a joke.\u201d\nQuestions about Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s actions toward subordinates have shadowed the early days of her 2020 presidential campaign, with articles in HuffPost and BuzzFeed News by turns fueling the hard-driving reputation that has followed her for years in Washington and angering supporters who see sexism in the criticism.\nMs. Klobuchar, 58, has allowed that she has \u201chigh expectations.\u201d\n\u201cAm I a tough boss sometimes? Yes,\u201d she said at a recent CNN forum. \u201cHave I pushed people too hard? Yes.\u201d\nPresented with a detailed accounting of The Times\u2019 reporting and the staff emails written by Ms. Klobuchar, a campaign spokeswoman, Carlie Waibel, said: \u201cThe senator has repeatedly acknowledged that she can be tough and push people hard. But these anonymous stories \u2014 some of which are just plain ridiculous \u2014 do not overshadow the countless experiences of people on the senator\u2019s team who she has been so proud to work with.\u201d\n[Our Politics editor, Patrick Healy, will be responding to readers\u2019 questions and feedback on our coverage of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Please leave your questions for him in the comments section.]\nDespite employee turnover that perennially ranks near the highest in the Senate, Ms. Klobuchar has defenders among her former staff. She noted at the forum that some people had been with her for many years.\nErikka Knuti, a former communications aide to the senator, described her experience as broadly positive and said Ms. Klobuchar could be contrite at times, remembering a gesture of regret from the senator once after she snapped at Ms. Knuti in an elevator in front of another lawmaker. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t O.K.,\u201d she recalled Ms. Klobuchar telling her. \u201cIt made me feel valued,\u201d Ms. Knuti said.\nWhile there was wide consensus in the interviews that women were often held to a different standard as bosses, former aides \u2014 female and male \u2014 said their concerns about Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s behavior should not be dismissed as gender bias. Many of the aides said they had worked for both men and women, for lawmakers both compassionate and unkind, without encountering anyone else like Ms. Klobuchar.\nThe world of congressional staffs is one of long hours and low pay, with much of the work shouldered by twentysomething junior aides who are learning on the job. Some members of Congress are notorious for round-the-clock phone calls, late-night email and fierce attention to their own press coverage. Ms. Klobuchar is among them, but former aides said they were especially troubled by her willingness \u2014 in excess of other senators\u2019, they said \u2014 to embarrass staff members over minor missteps or with odd requests.\n[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]\nMost of those interviewed for this article \u2014 describing memories that span from shortly after her election in 2006 to the much more recent past \u2014 discussed their time with Ms. Klobuchar on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the senator. These concerns were not idle, they said. Saving potentially damaging emails from Ms. Klobuchar became something of a last-day ritual, the aides said, in case they ever needed evidence of her conduct for their own reputational protection.\nShe was known to throw office objects in frustration, including binders and phones, in the direction of aides, they said. Low-level employees were asked to perform duties they described as demeaning, like washing her dishes or other cleaning \u2014 a possible violation of Senate ethics rules, according to veterans of the chamber.\nAppraisals of perceived staff incompetence were delivered at all hours of the day and night:\n\u201cIn 20 years in politics I have never seen worse prep,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said in one email, displeased at how a political event had been handled.\n\u201cThis is the hands down worse thing you have ever given me,\u201d she wrote in another, questioning her team\u2019s grasp of policy as she rejected its \u201cslop.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the worst press staff I ever had,\u201d she announced once to employees, according to an aide present. This was effectively a rite of passage, the aide said: The senator had plainly said the same about both predecessors and successors in the office.\nStill, while few contest that serving Ms. Klobuchar could be a challenge, other current and former aides spoke fondly of the experience, expressing pride over the national platform she has earned. The senator\u2019s defenders say her conduct must be viewed in the larger context of women in Washington, where male leaders with legendary tempers and famously exacting standards, like former President Bill Clinton, have long subsisted atop the political food chain.\nFor Ms. Klobuchar, there is the added complication of tending to a campaign image premised on affable Midwestern common sense.\n\u201cThe \u2018Minnesota nice\u2019 thing is also kind of a double-edged sword,\u201d Ms. Knuti said. \u201cIn the Midwest you have to be outwardly nice and congenial. But these are tough people. Male senators yell quite a bit. But if a woman yells at you, it\u2019s like, \u2018I got yelled at by my mom.\u2019\u201d\nThis much is not in dispute: For years, Ms. Klobuchar has had among the highest rates of staff turnover in the Senate, according to a review of congressional offices from the website LegiStorm. Over much of her Senate career, no one outpaced Ms. Klobuchar on this score; in 2017, two freshman senators, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, surpassed her.\nThe churn has produced a bit of a vicious circle. Democrats in Washington say she has struggled to recruit and retain top talent. Some operatives say they have shied away from her 2020 campaign, mindful of Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s reputation.\nAmong other concerns, her office\u2019s paid parental leave policy has been described as unusual on Capitol Hill. Two people familiar with the policy said that those who took paid leave were effectively required, once they returned, to remain with the office for three times as many weeks as they had been gone. The policy, outlined in an employee handbook, called for those who left anyway to pay back money earned during the weeks they were on leave.\nAfter receiving questions about the policy from The Times, Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s office said it would be revised. \u201cWe offer 12 weeks of paid maternity and paternity leave for our staff and have one of the strongest paid leave policies in the Senate,\u201d said a spokeswoman, Elana Ross. \u201cWe\u2019ve never made staff pay back any of their leave and will be changing that language in the handbook.\u201d She declined to provide a copy of the current policy as written.\nMs. Klobuchar\u2019s supporters say the office environment has never adversely affected her work, cheering her status as a bipartisan pragmatist with a solidly Democratic record and political instincts more moderate than many of her 2020 peers\u2019. They cite her status as a legislative advocate for major national causes like lower prescription drug prices and more local issues like swimming pool safety after a tragic accident in Minnesota.\nThe senator can also be charming, funny and warm, they say \u2014 a fixture at staff weddings and birthday parties. Jonathan Becker, her former chief of staff, said that while Ms. Klobuchar could be tough, the intensity was \u201cexhilarating, too,\u201d compelling aides to raise their performance.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that what the American people want in a president?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking for mashed potatoes.\u201d\nOthers said that Ms. Klobuchar often squandered time and mental energy on trivial matters, obsessing over perceived snubs in news media clickbait about who was up or down in Washington and repeatedly suggesting that an inferior staff was standing in her way.\n\u201cSenator Leahy, I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t put up with this,\u201d she once said of her colleague, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the longest-serving active senator, according to a person present.\nSome former aides who were frequent targets of her ire acknowledged that the senator often had a point, praising her intelligence and political antenna. She has been re-elected in two landslides, including a 24-point victory last year in a state President Trump lost narrowly.\nBut her blistering feedback to staff was often substantially out of proportion to the offense, these former aides said. Word choice or grammatical issues could make Ms. Klobuchar especially furious, not only in prepared text but also in office meetings or common speech. Words like \u201cstraight-shooting\u201d and \u201cabsolutely\u201d were known to invite her scorn. She urged staff members never to say that another senator \u201cled\u201d something and asked them to call her a \u201cco-sponsor\u201d of legislation instead of a supporter, suggesting that the latter sounded weak.\nMs. Klobuchar\u2019s exasperation often appeared connected to two factors: an abiding fear of being embarrassed in front of colleagues or in the press and the conviction that she works harder than her staff.\nIn one message, in which she said she had not been prepared properly for an event, Ms. Klobuchar reminded her team of the hours she kept.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t claim lack of time,\u201d she wrote, asking what else might explain their failure. \u201cI flew in at one in the morning. I don\u2019t have that luxury to blame lack of time. Unless YOU were up working at one am, and up again five am the next day, please don\u2019t claim lack of time. That was when I was up.\u201d\nIn private, she could deliver slashing remarks without particular provocation. Parched one day in the Capitol, she turned to a member of her team and said, \u201cI would trade three of you for a bottle of water,\u201d according to a person who witnessed it.\nFormer aides said Ms. Klobuchar frequently told them they were damaging her political career. On one occasion, a former aide recalled, Ms. Klobuchar accused her of \u201cruining my marriage,\u201d too. (The aide said she interpreted the comment to mean that Ms. Klobuchar, in her telling, was forced to work overtime, away from family, to overcome the aide\u2019s failings.)\nMany staff members did warmly recall the misery-loves-company camaraderie that built among aggrieved aides. But the core truth of life with Ms. Klobuchar was never going to change, they said: She thought she was demanding their best and getting far less. And she was never going to apologize for pointing that out.\n\u201cI need to do some serious soul searching about our office,\u201d she said in one email, lamenting the team\u2019s work product. \u201cHow can you treat me like this time and time again?\u201d",

Cohen, President Trump&rsquo;s former lawyer and fixer, met last month with federal prosecutors in Manhattan, offering information about possible irregularities within the president&rsquo;s family business and about a donor to the inaugural committee, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen, who worked at the Trump Organization for a decade, spoke with the prosecutors about insurance claims the company had filed over the years, said the people, who did not elaborate on the nature of the possible irregularities.</p>\n<p>While it was not clear whether the prosecutors found Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s information credible and whether they intended to pursue it, the meeting suggests that they are interested in broader aspects of the Trump Organization, beyond their investigation into <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/09/us/trump-organization-federal-prosecutors.html\">the company&rsquo;s role in the hush money payments</a> made before the 2016 election to women claiming to have had affairs with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty last summer to arranging those payments.</p>\n<p>The prosecutors also questioned Mr. Cohen about a donor to the president&rsquo;s inaugural committee, Imaad Zuberi, a California venture capitalist and political fund-raiser, according to the people familiar with the matter, who were not authorized to discuss the confidential meeting. Around the time that Mr. Zuberi contributed $900,000 to the committee, he also tried to hire Mr. Cohen as a consultant and wrote him a substantial check, one of the people said.</p>\n<p>Although Mr. Cohen did not go through with the arrangement, he was building a consulting business at the time with clients who sought to understand and have access to the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Mr. Zuberi, Steve Rabinowitz, confirmed the check on Friday, saying it was for $100,000 and never cashed. Mr. Zuberi, the only person directly referenced in a recent subpoena the prosecutors sent the inaugural committee, had previously denied having any dealings with Mr. Cohen beyond a few conversations.</p>\n<p>There was no indication that Mr. Cohen, who is scheduled to begin serving a three-year prison sentence in May, implicated Mr. Trump in the possible irregularities discussed during the meeting last month. If prosecutors concluded that Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s information was truthful and valuable, they could ask the judge who sentenced him to reduce his prison term.</p>\n<p>The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization. A spokeswoman at the company did not respond to requests for comment. In the past, the president has accused Mr. Cohen of lying to try to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p>Lanny Davis, a lawyer and adviser to Mr. Cohen, would not comment on the investigations beyond saying that his client was &ldquo;interested in cooperating with and assisting&rdquo; the prosecutors &ldquo;in any way they believe is helpful.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A spokesman for the United States attorney&rsquo;s office in Manhattan, known as the Southern District of New York, declined to comment.</p>\n<p>The prosecutors recently sought to interview Trump Organization executives, according to a person briefed on the request, which was previously reported by CNN. The nature of the questions they were seeking to ask was not known.</p>\n<p>So far, Mr. Cohen is the only person sentenced to significant prison time in various investigations connected to Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p>In August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws for his role in the hush money payments, as well as tax and bank crimes. In a separate case brought by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, Mr. Cohen <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-russia-mueller.html\">pleaded guilty in November</a> to lying to Congress about the timing of negotiations to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow, and about the extent of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s involvement in the plans.</p>\n<p>In a memo to the court before he was sentenced in December, Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s lawyers wrote that he was being disproportionately punished for &ldquo;conduct that is routinely pursued through noncriminal enforcement,&rdquo; referring to his admission of tax evasion. His lawyers drew a comparison to celebrities who received either fines or far less time after being charged with extensive tax fraud.</p>\n<p>The session with the Southern District prosecutors was not the first time Mr. Cohen provided information that could possibly lead to a reduced sentence. Earlier, Mr. Cohen met twice with the prosecutors to assist their investigation of the payments to women, including the Trump Organization&rsquo;s decision to reimburse Mr. Cohen for $130,000 he paid to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels.</p>\n<p>In an interview in December, Mr. Cohen told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News that he was &ldquo;done with the lying.&rdquo; He went on: &ldquo;I am done being loyal to President Trump, and my first loyalty belongs to my wife, my daughter, my son and this country.</p>\n<p>Federal law allows prosecutors to seek &mdash; and a judge to grant &mdash; a reduced prison term for a defendant who offers &ldquo;substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person&rdquo; within a year of being sentenced. The same rule would also allow the judge to consider assistance Mr. Cohen provided, before his sentencing, to the special counsel. Last year, he met seven times with prosecutors from Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s office.</p>\n<p>The continued scrutiny of the Trump family business and inaugural committee from the Southern District comes as Mr. Mueller is said to be wrapping up his investigation. Once he completes a report with his findings, various aspects of his investigation are expected to live on in the Southern District and other United States attorneys offices.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen declined to seek a formal cooperation deal with the Southern District, which would have required him to disclose any crimes he had committed or had been aware of, and would have delayed his sentencing. His decision to forgo such an agreement most likely contributed to the severity of his sentence; his lawyer had argued for no prison time.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump had offered a different view, saying late last year that Mr. Cohen should serve a &ldquo;full and complete&rdquo; prison sentence. And as Mr. Cohen remained in the spotlight as a likely witness before Congress, Mr. Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-investigations.html\">intensified his attacks on his former employee</a>, urging prosecutors and the media to scrutinize Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s family.</p>\n<p>The attacks led Mr. Cohen to postpone a planned appearance before the House oversight committee earlier this month. But this week, the committee announced that the testimony was back on for next Wednesday and that Democrats planned to question Mr. Cohen about &ldquo;the president&rsquo;s business practices.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen has also agreed to testify behind closed doors before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen was originally scheduled to begin his prison term next month, but his lawyers cited the congressional testimony &mdash; as well as recent shoulder surgery &mdash; as a reason for a two-month delay. The judge overseeing Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s case granted the request on Wednesday.</p>",

                "text": "Susan Walsh/Associated Press\nMichael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, met last month with federal prosecutors in Manhattan, offering information about possible irregularities within the president\u2019s family business and about a donor to the inaugural committee, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMr. Cohen, who worked at the Trump Organization for a decade, spoke with the prosecutors about insurance claims the company had filed over the years, said the people, who did not elaborate on the nature of the possible irregularities.\nWhile it was not clear whether the prosecutors found Mr. Cohen\u2019s information credible and whether they intended to pursue it, the meeting suggests that they are interested in broader aspects of the Trump Organization, beyond their investigation into the company\u2019s role in the hush money payments made before the 2016 election to women claiming to have had affairs with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty last summer to arranging those payments.\nThe prosecutors also questioned Mr. Cohen about a donor to the president\u2019s inaugural committee, Imaad Zuberi, a California venture capitalist and political fund-raiser, according to the people familiar with the matter, who were not authorized to discuss the confidential meeting. Around the time that Mr. Zuberi contributed $900,000 to the committee, he also tried to hire Mr. Cohen as a consultant and wrote him a substantial check, one of the people said.\nAlthough Mr. Cohen did not go through with the arrangement, he was building a consulting business at the time with clients who sought to understand and have access to the Trump administration.\nA spokesman for Mr. Zuberi, Steve Rabinowitz, confirmed the check on Friday, saying it was for $100,000 and never cashed. Mr. Zuberi, the only person directly referenced in a recent subpoena the prosecutors sent the inaugural committee, had previously denied having any dealings with Mr. Cohen beyond a few conversations.\nThere was no indication that Mr. Cohen, who is scheduled to begin serving a three-year prison sentence in May, implicated Mr. Trump in the possible irregularities discussed during the meeting last month. If prosecutors concluded that Mr. Cohen\u2019s information was truthful and valuable, they could ask the judge who sentenced him to reduce his prison term.\nThe White House referred questions to the Trump Organization. A spokeswoman at the company did not respond to requests for comment. In the past, the president has accused Mr. Cohen of lying to try to reduce his sentence.\nLanny Davis, a lawyer and adviser to Mr. Cohen, would not comment on the investigations beyond saying that his client was \u201cinterested in cooperating with and assisting\u201d the prosecutors \u201cin any way they believe is helpful.\u201d\nA spokesman for the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, known as the Southern District of New York, declined to comment.\nThe prosecutors recently sought to interview Trump Organization executives, according to a person briefed on the request, which was previously reported by CNN. The nature of the questions they were seeking to ask was not known.\nSo far, Mr. Cohen is the only person sentenced to significant prison time in various investigations connected to Mr. Trump.\nIn August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws for his role in the hush money payments, as well as tax and bank crimes. In a separate case brought by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about the timing of negotiations to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow, and about the extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement in the plans.\nIn a memo to the court before he was sentenced in December, Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers wrote that he was being disproportionately punished for \u201cconduct that is routinely pursued through noncriminal enforcement,\u201d referring to his admission of tax evasion. His lawyers drew a comparison to celebrities who received either fines or far less time after being charged with extensive tax fraud.\nThe session with the Southern District prosecutors was not the first time Mr. Cohen provided information that could possibly lead to a reduced sentence. Earlier, Mr. Cohen met twice with the prosecutors to assist their investigation of the payments to women, including the Trump Organization\u2019s decision to reimburse Mr. Cohen for $130,000 he paid to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels.\nIn an interview in December, Mr. Cohen told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News that he was \u201cdone with the lying.\u201d He went on: \u201cI am done being loyal to President Trump, and my first loyalty belongs to my wife, my daughter, my son and this country.\nFederal law allows prosecutors to seek \u2014 and a judge to grant \u2014 a reduced prison term for a defendant who offers \u201csubstantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person\u201d within a year of being sentenced. The same rule would also allow the judge to consider assistance Mr. Cohen provided, before his sentencing, to the special counsel. Last year, he met seven times with prosecutors from Mr. Mueller\u2019s office.\nThe continued scrutiny of the Trump family business and inaugural committee from the Southern District comes as Mr. Mueller is said to be wrapping up his investigation. Once he completes a report with his findings, various aspects of his investigation are expected to live on in the Southern District and other United States attorneys offices.\nMr. Cohen declined to seek a formal cooperation deal with the Southern District, which would have required him to disclose any crimes he had committed or had been aware of, and would have delayed his sentencing. His decision to forgo such an agreement most likely contributed to the severity of his sentence; his lawyer had argued for no prison time.\nMr. Trump had offered a different view, saying late last year that Mr. Cohen should serve a \u201cfull and complete\u201d prison sentence. And as Mr. Cohen remained in the spotlight as a likely witness before Congress, Mr. Trump intensified his attacks on his former employee, urging prosecutors and the media to scrutinize Mr. Cohen\u2019s family.\nThe attacks led Mr. Cohen to postpone a planned appearance before the House oversight committee earlier this month. But this week, the committee announced that the testimony was back on for next Wednesday and that Democrats planned to question Mr. Cohen about \u201cthe president\u2019s business practices.\u201d\nMr. Cohen has also agreed to testify behind closed doors before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.\nMr. Cohen was originally scheduled to begin his prison term next month, but his lawyers cited the congressional testimony \u2014 as well as recent shoulder surgery \u2014 as a reason for a two-month delay. The judge overseeing Mr. Cohen\u2019s case granted the request on Wednesday.",

Unlike alcohol or opioids, phones aren&rsquo;t an addictive substance so much as a species-level environmental shock. We might someday evolve the correct biological hardware to live in harmony with portable supercomputers that satisfy our every need and connect us to infinite amounts of stimulation. But for most of us, it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been a heavy phone user for my entire adult life. But sometime last year, I crossed the invisible line into problem territory. My symptoms were all the typical ones: I found myself incapable of reading books, watching full-length movies or having long uninterrupted conversations. Social media made me angry and anxious, and even the digital spaces I once found soothing (group texts, podcasts, YouTube k-holes) weren&rsquo;t helping. I tried various tricks to curb my usage, like deleting Twitter every weekend, turning my screen <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/technology/grayscale-phone.html\">grayscale</a> and installing app-blockers. But I always relapsed.</p>\n<p>Eventually, in late December, I decided that enough was enough. I called Catherine Price, a science journalist and the author of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://phonebreakup.com/\">How to Break Up With Your Phone</a>,&rdquo; a 30-day guide to eliminating bad phone habits. And I begged her for help.</p>\n<p>Mercifully, she agreed to be my phone coach for the month of January, and walk me through her plan, step by step. Together, we would build a healthy relationship with my phone, and try to unbreak my brain.</p>\n<h2>&lsquo;A Bit Horrifying&rsquo;</h2>\n<p>I confess that entering phone rehab feels clich&eacute;d, like getting really into healing crystals or Peloton. Digital wellness is a budding industry these days, with loads of self-help gurus offering miracle cures for screen addiction. Some of those solutions involve new devices &mdash; such as the &ldquo;Light Phone,&rdquo; a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/light-phone-2-cure-for-app-addiction-2018-2\">device</a> with an extremely limited feature set that is meant to wean users off time-sucking apps. Others focus on cutting out screens entirely for weeks on end. You can now buy $299 &ldquo;digital detox&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/you-can-save-big-money-by-going-on-a-digital-detox-at-these-hotels-and-restaurants-2018-10-13\">packages</a> at luxury hotels or join the &ldquo;<a href=\"http://digitalsabbath.io/\">digital sabbath&rdquo;</a> movement, whose adherents vow to spend one day a week using no technology at all.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Catherine&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://screenlifebalance.com/\">plan</a> is more practical. I&rsquo;m a tech columnist, and while I don&rsquo;t begrudge anyone for trying more extreme forms of disconnection, my job prevents me from going cold turkey.</p>\n<p>Instead, her program focuses on addressing the root causes of phone addiction, including the emotional triggers that cause you to reach for your phone in the first place. The point isn&rsquo;t to get you off the internet, or even off social media &mdash; you&rsquo;re still allowed to use Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms on a desktop or laptop, and there&rsquo;s no hard-and-fast time limit. It&rsquo;s simply about unhooking your brain from the harmful routines it has adopted around this particular device, and hooking it to better things.</p>\n<p>When we started, I sent her my screen time statistics, which showed that I had spent 5 hours and 37 minutes on my phone that day, and picked it up 101 times &mdash; roughly twice as many as the <a href=\"https://bgr.com/2018/11/13/smartphone-addiction-survey-data/\">average American</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That is frankly insane and makes me want to die,&rdquo; I wrote to her.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I will admit that those numbers are a bit horrifying,&rdquo; she replied.</p>\n<p><em>[More from Kevin Roose: </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/06/technology/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-electric-scooters.html\"><em>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Electric Scooters</em></a><em>.]</em></p>\n<p>Catherine encouraged me to set up mental speed bumps so that I would be forced to think for a second before engaging with my phone. I put a rubber band around the device, for example, and changed my lock screen to one that showed three questions to ask myself every time I unlocked my phone: &ldquo;What for? Why now? What else?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For the rest of the week, I became acutely aware of the bizarre phone habits I&rsquo;d developed. I noticed that I reach for my phone every time I brush my teeth or step outside the front door of my apartment building, and that, for some pathological reason, I always check my email during the three-second window between when I insert my credit card into a chip reader at a store and when the card is accepted.</p>\n<p>Mostly, I became aware of how profoundly uncomfortable I am with stillness. For years, I&rsquo;ve used my phone every time I&rsquo;ve had a spare moment in an elevator or a boring meeting. I listen to podcasts and write emails on the subway. I watch YouTube videos while folding laundry. I even use an app to pretend to meditate.</p>\n<p>If I was going to repair my brain, I needed to practice doing nothing. So during my morning walk to the office, I looked up at the buildings around me, spotting architectural details I&rsquo;d never noticed before. On the subway, I kept my phone in my pocket and people-watched &mdash; noticing the nattily dressed man in the yellow hat, the teens eating hot Takis and laughing, the kid with Velcro shoes.

It gets your hands dirty, too, which is a good deterrent to fiddling with expensive electronics.</p>\n<p>After a pottery class, I updated my wife on my progress. I told her that while it felt great to disconnect, I still worried that I was missing something important. I liked having a constant stream of news at my fingertips, and I wanted to do more of the things I actually like about social media, like keeping tabs on my friends&rsquo; babies and maintaining ambient Kardashian awareness.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sad that you&rsquo;re having trouble with this,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s been great for me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She explained that since my phone detox started, I&rsquo;d been more present and attentive at home.

Isn&rsquo;t it my job to know when news happens? Won&rsquo;t I be neglecting my duties if it takes me an extra hour to learn that Jeff Bezos is getting divorced, or another YouTuber did something racist?</p>\n<p>I put this question to Catherine, who reassured me that I wasn&rsquo;t jeopardizing my career by being slightly later to the news. She reminded me that I&rsquo;d been happier since I dialed down my screen time, and she gently encouraged me to focus on the other side of the cost-benefit analysis.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Think of the bigger picture of what you&rsquo;re getting by not being on Twitter all the time.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>A Thoreau Cleansing</h2>\n<p>The biggest test came with a &ldquo;trial separation&rdquo; &mdash; a 48-hour period during which I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to use my phone or any other digital device. (Catherine&rsquo;s program calls for a 24-hour separation, but I decided to try a more hard-core version.)</p>\n<p>I had dreaded this idea at the outset, but when the weekend actually arrived, I got giddy with excitement. I rented an off-the-grid Airbnb in the Catskills, warned my editor that I&rsquo;d be offline for the weekend and took off.</p>\n<p>A phone-free weekend involved some complications. Without Google Maps, I got lost and had to pull over for directions. Without Yelp, I had trouble finding open restaurants.</p>\n<p>But mostly, it was great. For two solid days, I basked in 19th-century leisure, feeling my nerves softening and my attention span stretching back out. I read books. I did the crossword puzzle. I lit a fire and looked at the stars. I felt like Thoreau, if Thoreau periodically wondered what was happening on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s Instagram story.</p>\n<p>I also felt twinges of anger &mdash; at myself, for missing out on this feeling of restorative boredom for so many years; at the engineers in Silicon Valley who spend their days profitably exploiting our cognitive weaknesses; at the entire phone-industrial complex that has convinced us that a six-inch glass-and-steel rectangle is the ideal conduit for worldly experiences.</p>\n<p>Sadly, there is no way to talk about the benefits of digital disconnection without sounding like a Goop subscriber or a neo-Luddite. Performative wellness is obnoxious, as is reflexive technophobia.</p>\n<p>But I cannot stress enough that under the right conditions, spending an entire weekend without a phone in your immediate vicinity is <em>incredible. </em>You have to try it.</p>\n<p><em>[Catch up and prep for the week ahead with the most important business insights.

I now pick up my phone only about 20 times a day, down from more than 100. I still use my phone for email and texting &mdash; and I&rsquo;m still using my laptop plenty &mdash; but I don&rsquo;t itch for social media, and I often go hours without so much as a peek at any screen.</p>\n<p>In one of our conversations, I asked Catherine if she worried that I would relapse. She said it was possible, given the addictive properties of phones and the likelihood that they&rsquo;ll only keep getting more essential. But she said that as long as I remained aware of my relationship with my phone, and continued to notice when and how I used it, I&rsquo;d have gotten something valuable.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Your life is what you pay attention to,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you want to spend it on video games or Twitter, that&rsquo;s your business. But it should be a conscious choice.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>One of the most unexpected benefits of this program is that by getting some emotional distance from my phone, I&rsquo;ve started to appreciate it again. I keep thinking: <em>Right here, in my pocket, is a device that can summon food, cars and millions of other consumer goods to my door. I can talk with everyone I&rsquo;ve ever met, create and store a photographic record of my entire life, and tap into the entire corpus of human knowledge with a few swipes.</em></p>\n<p>Steve Jobs wasn&rsquo;t exaggerating when he described the iPhone as a kind of magical object, and it&rsquo;s truly wild that in the span of a few years, we&rsquo;ve managed to turn these amazing talismanic tools into stress-inducing albatrosses. It&rsquo;s as if scientists had invented a pill that gave us the ability to fly, only to find out that it also gave us dementia.</p>\n<p>But there is a way out. I haven&rsquo;t taken an M.R.I. or undergone a psychiatric evaluation, but I&rsquo;d bet that something fundamental has shifted inside my brain in the past month. A few weeks ago, the world on my phone seemed more compelling than the offline world &mdash; more colorful, faster-moving and with a bigger scope of rewards.</p>\n<p>I still love that world, and probably always will. But now, the physical world excites me, too &mdash; the one that has room for boredom, idle hands and space for thinking. I no longer feel phantom buzzes in my pocket or have dreams about checking my Twitter replies. I look people in the eye and listen when they talk. I ride the elevator empty-handed. And when I get sucked into my phone, I notice and self-correct.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not a full recovery, and I&rsquo;ll have to stay vigilant. But for the first time in a long time, I&rsquo;m starting to feel like a human again.</p>",

                "text": "Demetrius Freeman for The New York Times\nMy name is Kevin, and I have a phone problem.\nAnd if you\u2019re anything like me \u2014 and the statistics suggest you probably are, at least where smartphones are concerned \u2014 you have one, too.\nI don\u2019t love referring to what we have as an \u201caddiction.\u201d That seems too sterile and clinical to describe what\u2019s happening to our brains in the smartphone era. Unlike alcohol or opioids, phones aren\u2019t an addictive substance so much as a species-level environmental shock. We might someday evolve the correct biological hardware to live in harmony with portable supercomputers that satisfy our every need and connect us to infinite amounts of stimulation. But for most of us, it hasn\u2019t happened yet.\nI\u2019ve been a heavy phone user for my entire adult life. But sometime last year, I crossed the invisible line into problem territory. My symptoms were all the typical ones: I found myself incapable of reading books, watching full-length movies or having long uninterrupted conversations. Social media made me angry and anxious, and even the digital spaces I once found soothing (group texts, podcasts, YouTube k-holes) weren\u2019t helping. I tried various tricks to curb my usage, like deleting Twitter every weekend, turning my screen grayscale and installing app-blockers. But I always relapsed.\nEventually, in late December, I decided that enough was enough. I called Catherine Price, a science journalist and the author of \u201cHow to Break Up With Your Phone,\u201d a 30-day guide to eliminating bad phone habits. And I begged her for help.\nMercifully, she agreed to be my phone coach for the month of January, and walk me through her plan, step by step. Together, we would build a healthy relationship with my phone, and try to unbreak my brain.\n\u2018A Bit Horrifying\u2019\nI confess that entering phone rehab feels clich\u00e9d, like getting really into healing crystals or Peloton. Digital wellness is a budding industry these days, with loads of self-help gurus offering miracle cures for screen addiction. Some of those solutions involve new devices \u2014 such as the \u201cLight Phone,\u201d a device with an extremely limited feature set that is meant to wean users off time-sucking apps. Others focus on cutting out screens entirely for weeks on end. You can now buy $299 \u201cdigital detox\u201d packages at luxury hotels or join the \u201cdigital sabbath\u201d movement, whose adherents vow to spend one day a week using no technology at all.\nThankfully, Catherine\u2019s plan is more practical. I\u2019m a tech columnist, and while I don\u2019t begrudge anyone for trying more extreme forms of disconnection, my job prevents me from going cold turkey.\nInstead, her program focuses on addressing the root causes of phone addiction, including the emotional triggers that cause you to reach for your phone in the first place. The point isn\u2019t to get you off the internet, or even off social media \u2014 you\u2019re still allowed to use Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms on a desktop or laptop, and there\u2019s no hard-and-fast time limit. It\u2019s simply about unhooking your brain from the harmful routines it has adopted around this particular device, and hooking it to better things.\nWhen we started, I sent her my screen time statistics, which showed that I had spent 5 hours and 37 minutes on my phone that day, and picked it up 101 times \u2014 roughly twice as many as the average American.\n\u201cThat is frankly insane and makes me want to die,\u201d I wrote to her.\n\u201cI will admit that those numbers are a bit horrifying,\u201d she replied.\n[More from Kevin Roose: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Electric Scooters.]\nCatherine encouraged me to set up mental speed bumps so that I would be forced to think for a second before engaging with my phone. I put a rubber band around the device, for example, and changed my lock screen to one that showed three questions to ask myself every time I unlocked my phone: \u201cWhat for? Why now? What else?\u201d\nFor the rest of the week, I became acutely aware of the bizarre phone habits I\u2019d developed. I noticed that I reach for my phone every time I brush my teeth or step outside the front door of my apartment building, and that, for some pathological reason, I always check my email during the three-second window between when I insert my credit card into a chip reader at a store and when the card is accepted.\nMostly, I became aware of how profoundly uncomfortable I am with stillness. For years, I\u2019ve used my phone every time I\u2019ve had a spare moment in an elevator or a boring meeting. I listen to podcasts and write emails on the subway. I watch YouTube videos while folding laundry. I even use an app to pretend to meditate.\nIf I was going to repair my brain, I needed to practice doing nothing. So during my morning walk to the office, I looked up at the buildings around me, spotting architectural details I\u2019d never noticed before. On the subway, I kept my phone in my pocket and people-watched \u2014 noticing the nattily dressed man in the yellow hat, the teens eating hot Takis and laughing, the kid with Velcro shoes. When a friend ran late for our lunch, I sat still and stared out the window instead of checking Twitter.\nIt\u2019s an unnerving sensation, being alone with your thoughts in the year 2019. Catherine had warned me that I might feel existential malaise when I wasn\u2019t distracting myself with my phone. She also said paying more attention to my surroundings would make me realize how many other people used their phones to cope with boredom and anxiety.\n\u201cI compare it to seeing a family member naked,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce you look around the elevator and see the zombies checking their phones, you can\u2019t unsee it.\u201d\n[Get more advice from The Times on living a more fulfilling life.

I kept messaging services like WhatsApp and Signal, and non-distracting utilities like cooking and navigation apps. I pruned my home screen to just the essentials: calendar, email and password manager. And I disabled push notifications for everything other than phone calls and messages from a preset list of people that included my editor, my wife and a handful of close friends.\n[More from Kevin Roose: Is Tech Too Easy to Use?]\nWhere you keep your phone is also important. Studies have shown that people who don\u2019t charge their phones in their bedrooms are significantly happier than those who do. Catherine charges her phone in a closet; for me, she recommended a locking mini-safe. I bought one and started storing my phone inside, which simultaneously reduced my nighttime usage and made me feel like I was guarding the queen\u2019s jewels.\nAnd I pursued activities that could replace my phone habit. On the recommendation of my colleague Farhad Manjoo, I signed up for pottery classes. As it turned out, pottery makes a perfect phone substitute. It\u2019s manually challenging and demands concentration for hours on end. It gets your hands dirty, too, which is a good deterrent to fiddling with expensive electronics.\nAfter a pottery class, I updated my wife on my progress. I told her that while it felt great to disconnect, I still worried that I was missing something important. I liked having a constant stream of news at my fingertips, and I wanted to do more of the things I actually like about social media, like keeping tabs on my friends\u2019 babies and maintaining ambient Kardashian awareness.\n\u201cI\u2019m sad that you\u2019re having trouble with this,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s been great for me.\u201d\nShe explained that since my phone detox started, I\u2019d been more present and attentive at home. I spent more time listening to her, and less time distractedly nodding and mumbling while checking my inbox or tapping out tweets.\nPsychologists have a name for this: \u201cphubbing,\u201d or snubbing a person in favor of your phone. Studies have shown that excessive phubbing decreases relationship satisfaction and contributes to feelings of depression and alienation.\nFor years, I\u2019ve justified my phubbing by treating it as a professional necessity. Isn\u2019t it my job to know when news happens? Won\u2019t I be neglecting my duties if it takes me an extra hour to learn that Jeff Bezos is getting divorced, or another YouTuber did something racist?\nI put this question to Catherine, who reassured me that I wasn\u2019t jeopardizing my career by being slightly later to the news. She reminded me that I\u2019d been happier since I dialed down my screen time, and she gently encouraged me to focus on the other side of the cost-benefit analysis.\n\u201cThink of the bigger picture of what you\u2019re getting by not being on Twitter all the time.\u201d\nA Thoreau Cleansing\nThe biggest test came with a \u201ctrial separation\u201d \u2014 a 48-hour period during which I wasn\u2019t allowed to use my phone or any other digital device. (Catherine\u2019s program calls for a 24-hour separation, but I decided to try a more hard-core version.)\nI had dreaded this idea at the outset, but when the weekend actually arrived, I got giddy with excitement. I rented an off-the-grid Airbnb in the Catskills, warned my editor that I\u2019d be offline for the weekend and took off.\nA phone-free weekend involved some complications. Without Google Maps, I got lost and had to pull over for directions. Without Yelp, I had trouble finding open restaurants.\nBut mostly, it was great. For two solid days, I basked in 19th-century leisure, feeling my nerves softening and my attention span stretching back out. I read books. I did the crossword puzzle. I lit a fire and looked at the stars. I felt like Thoreau, if Thoreau periodically wondered what was happening on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Instagram story.\nI also felt twinges of anger \u2014 at myself, for missing out on this feeling of restorative boredom for so many years; at the engineers in Silicon Valley who spend their days profitably exploiting our cognitive weaknesses; at the entire phone-industrial complex that has convinced us that a six-inch glass-and-steel rectangle is the ideal conduit for worldly experiences.\nSadly, there is no way to talk about the benefits of digital disconnection without sounding like a Goop subscriber or a neo-Luddite. Performative wellness is obnoxious, as is reflexive technophobia.\nBut I cannot stress enough that under the right conditions, spending an entire weekend without a phone in your immediate vicinity is incredible. You have to try it.\n[Catch up and prep for the week ahead with the most important business insights. Subscribe to the With Interest newsletter.]\nRewired and Renewed\nAllow me a bit of bragging: Over the course of 30 days, my average daily phone time, as measured by the iPhone\u2019s built-in screen time tracker, has dwindled from around five hours to just over an hour. I now pick up my phone only about 20 times a day, down from more than 100. I still use my phone for email and texting \u2014 and I\u2019m still using my laptop plenty \u2014 but I don\u2019t itch for social media, and I often go hours without so much as a peek at any screen.\nIn one of our conversations, I asked Catherine if she worried that I would relapse. She said it was possible, given the addictive properties of phones and the likelihood that they\u2019ll only keep getting more essential. But she said that as long as I remained aware of my relationship with my phone, and continued to notice when and how I used it, I\u2019d have gotten something valuable.\n\u201cYour life is what you pay attention to,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to spend it on video games or Twitter, that\u2019s your business. But it should be a conscious choice.\u201d\nOne of the most unexpected benefits of this program is that by getting some emotional distance from my phone, I\u2019ve started to appreciate it again. I keep thinking: Right here, in my pocket, is a device that can summon food, cars and millions of other consumer goods to my door. I can talk with everyone I\u2019ve ever met, create and store a photographic record of my entire life, and tap into the entire corpus of human knowledge with a few swipes.\nSteve Jobs wasn\u2019t exaggerating when he described the iPhone as a kind of magical object, and it\u2019s truly wild that in the span of a few years, we\u2019ve managed to turn these amazing talismanic tools into stress-inducing albatrosses. It\u2019s as if scientists had invented a pill that gave us the ability to fly, only to find out that it also gave us dementia.\nBut there is a way out. I haven\u2019t taken an M.R.I. or undergone a psychiatric evaluation, but I\u2019d bet that something fundamental has shifted inside my brain in the past month. A few weeks ago, the world on my phone seemed more compelling than the offline world \u2014 more colorful, faster-moving and with a bigger scope of rewards.\nI still love that world, and probably always will. But now, the physical world excites me, too \u2014 the one that has room for boredom, idle hands and space for thinking. I no longer feel phantom buzzes in my pocket or have dreams about checking my Twitter replies. I look people in the eye and listen when they talk. I ride the elevator empty-handed. And when I get sucked into my phone, I notice and self-correct.\nIt\u2019s not a full recovery, and I\u2019ll have to stay vigilant. But for the first time in a long time, I\u2019m starting to feel like a human again.",

It was the first day of the spring term and &ldquo;bear,&rdquo; at least when it was spelled that way, was not what the students expected to discuss.</p>\n<p>Once their ursine images were firmly in place, Ms. Zaloom asked for descriptions. One student had pictured a grizzly; another was thinking about a black bear cub; there were polar bears and gummy bears. Personally, I had imagined Yogi. The point, Ms. Zaloom said, is that in a sexual situation, you can&rsquo;t make assumptions.</p>\n<p>I think about those bears every time yet another allegation of sexual misconduct against yet another powerful man becomes public. Nearly all of those men deny coercion or aggression or insist that the encounters were &ldquo;100 percent consensual.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But rarely do they define what, precisely, they mean by that. Did they discuss, with an enthusiastic partner, which erotic acts to indulge in together? Or were they satisfied that whatever they initiated was fine as long as she didn&rsquo;t say no? Did they consider passionate kissing a tacit contract for something else? Was forced sex &mdash; say, the pushing down of a partner&rsquo;s head &mdash; fair game because lots of guys do it? Did they consider sex with underlings acceptable, or a fair swap for career advancement, in which case they were apparently thinking of koalas, which are not actually bears at all?</p>\n<p>The truth is, men are not the most reliable arbiters of whether sex was consensual. Consider: When Nicole Bedera, a doctoral candidate in sociology at the University of Michigan, interviewed male college students in 2015, each could articulate at least a rudimentary definition of the concept: the idea that both parties wanted to be doing what they were doing. Most also endorsed the current &ldquo;yes means yes&rdquo; standard, which requires active, conscious, continuous and freely given agreement by all parties engaging in sexual activity. Yet when asked to describe their own most recent encounters in both a hookup and in a relationship, even men who claimed to practice affirmative consent often had not.</p>\n<p>When they realized that their actions conflicted with that benchmark, though, they expanded their definition of consent rather than question their conduct. Their ideas of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; were so elastic that for some they encompassed behavior that met the legal criteria for assault &mdash; such as the guy who had coerced his girlfriend into anal sex (she had said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to, but I guess I&rsquo;ll let you&rdquo;). She then made it clear that he should stop. &ldquo;He did, eventually,&rdquo; Ms. Bedera told me, &ldquo;and he seemed aware of how upset she was, but he found a way to rationalize it: He was angry with her for refusing him because he thought a real man shouldn&rsquo;t have had to beg for sex.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Despite all evidence to the contrary, we still want to believe that men who are accused of sexual assault are all &ldquo;monsters.&rdquo; True, some of them may be monsters we know &mdash; our employers, our clergymen, our favorite celebrities, our politicians, our Supreme Court justices &mdash; but they are &ldquo;monsters&rdquo; nonetheless.</p>\n<p>A &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; can&rsquo;t possibly have committed assault, regardless of the mental gymnastics he has to engage in to convince himself of that (&ldquo;20 minutes of action,&rdquo; anyone?). Even men who admit to keeping sex slaves in conflict zones will claim they did not commit rape &mdash; it&rsquo;s that other guy, that &ldquo;monster&rdquo; over there, that &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo; who did. In fact, one of the traits rapists have been found to reliably share is that they don&rsquo;t believe they are the problem.</p>\n<p>In my own interviews with high school and college students conducted over the past two years, young men that I like enormously &mdash; friendly, thoughtful, bright, engaging young men &mdash; have &ldquo;sort of&rdquo; raped girls, have pushed women&rsquo;s heads down to get oral sex, have taken a Snapchat video of a prom date performing oral sex and sent it to the baseball team. They all described themselves as &ldquo;good guys.&rdquo; But the fact is, a &ldquo;really good guy&rdquo; can do a really bad thing.</p>\n<p>Young men&rsquo;s ability to understand sexual refusal has been shown to be remarkably sophisticated and subtle, regardless of whether the word &ldquo;no&rdquo; is actually uttered; that renders dubious the common defense that they &ldquo;can&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; or &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t mind readers.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s more, where &ldquo;yes&rdquo; is concerned, guys seem downright clairvoyant: They routinely over-perceive a woman&rsquo;s interest in having sex with them, even more so if the men have been drinking.</p>\n<p>In 2016, for instance, researchers at <a href=\"http://confi.co/\">Confi</a>, an online resource dedicated to women&rsquo;s health issues, <a href=\"http://confi.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3pg-Summary-Confi-College-Sexual-Assault-Study.pdf\">asked</a> 1,200 college students and recent graduates nationwide what they would &ldquo;expect to happen next&rdquo; if they went home with someone whom they&rsquo;d met and danced with at a party. Forty-five percent of the men considered vaginal intercourse &ldquo;likely&rdquo;; only 30 percent of the women did. The figures were similarly skewed for oral sex. Additionally, one in four men believed women &ldquo;usually have to be convinced&rdquo; in order for sex to happen (only about a tenth of the women agreed).</p>\n<p>Not only are those perception gaps a setup for assault, but also for men&rsquo;s subsequent denials of responsibility and, quite possibly, claims of false accusation. According to the same survey, men found the actions of a &ldquo;tipsy&rdquo; guy &ldquo;much more acceptable&rdquo; than a sober one, meaning they let themselves off the hook for potential sexual aggression, even as female assault victims who drink are blamed.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, boys I talk to acknowledge having willfully crossed lines. One college sophomore had repeatedly ignored his partner&rsquo;s hesitation during a hookup, despite his own professed scrupulousness about consent.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I suppose there was something in the back of my head that I wasn&rsquo;t fully listening to,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I guess when you&rsquo;ve been flirting with someone the whole evening and you feel close to what you&rsquo;ve been wanting to happen, it&rsquo;s difficult to put on the brakes. And &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know. I was enjoying myself. I was having what in the moment was a positive sexual experience. I think I just <em>wanted</em> to. Which is scary.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And that may be the crux of it. Young men still too often learn to prioritize their pleasure over women&rsquo;s feelings, to interpret a partner&rsquo;s behavior through the lens of their own wishes. Their claims of &ldquo;miscommunication,&rdquo; Ms. Bedera concluded in her research on college men, may actually be part of &ldquo;an expectation that they control both partners&rsquo; narratives about desire and consent.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>All of which would indicate that in these high-profile cases, women&rsquo;s accusations are inherently more credible than male denial, regardless of how vehement that denial may be. It also means that despite the new standards that have been put in place and despite all the editorials and news articles and calls for change, we are still not doing what needs to be done: fully educating boys not only about the importance of consensual, ethical, mutually pleasurable sexuality, but about the ways their own sense of entitlement may blind them to those values, leading them to cause harm, whether or not they choose to see it.</p>\n<p>In other words, we have to start dealing with the bear in the room.</p>\n<p>Peggy Orenstein is the author, most recently, of &ldquo;Girls &amp; Sex: Navigating the Complicated New Landscape.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\"><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.

                "text": "Erin Schaff for The New York Times\n\u201cThink of a bear.\u201d\nShafia Zaloom, a health teacher in San Francisco, stood in front of her 10th grade sex ed class. It was the first day of the spring term and \u201cbear,\u201d at least when it was spelled that way, was not what the students expected to discuss.\nOnce their ursine images were firmly in place, Ms. Zaloom asked for descriptions. One student had pictured a grizzly; another was thinking about a black bear cub; there were polar bears and gummy bears. Personally, I had imagined Yogi. The point, Ms. Zaloom said, is that in a sexual situation, you can\u2019t make assumptions.\nI think about those bears every time yet another allegation of sexual misconduct against yet another powerful man becomes public. Nearly all of those men deny coercion or aggression or insist that the encounters were \u201c100 percent consensual.\u201d\nBut rarely do they define what, precisely, they mean by that. Did they discuss, with an enthusiastic partner, which erotic acts to indulge in together? Or were they satisfied that whatever they initiated was fine as long as she didn\u2019t say no? Did they consider passionate kissing a tacit contract for something else? Was forced sex \u2014 say, the pushing down of a partner\u2019s head \u2014 fair game because lots of guys do it? Did they consider sex with underlings acceptable, or a fair swap for career advancement, in which case they were apparently thinking of koalas, which are not actually bears at all?\nThe truth is, men are not the most reliable arbiters of whether sex was consensual. Consider: When Nicole Bedera, a doctoral candidate in sociology at the University of Michigan, interviewed male college students in 2015, each could articulate at least a rudimentary definition of the concept: the idea that both parties wanted to be doing what they were doing. Most also endorsed the current \u201cyes means yes\u201d standard, which requires active, conscious, continuous and freely given agreement by all parties engaging in sexual activity. Yet when asked to describe their own most recent encounters in both a hookup and in a relationship, even men who claimed to practice affirmative consent often had not.\nWhen they realized that their actions conflicted with that benchmark, though, they expanded their definition of consent rather than question their conduct. Their ideas of \u201cyes\u201d were so elastic that for some they encompassed behavior that met the legal criteria for assault \u2014 such as the guy who had coerced his girlfriend into anal sex (she had said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to, but I guess I\u2019ll let you\u201d). She then made it clear that he should stop. \u201cHe did, eventually,\u201d Ms. Bedera told me, \u201cand he seemed aware of how upset she was, but he found a way to rationalize it: He was angry with her for refusing him because he thought a real man shouldn\u2019t have had to beg for sex.\u201d\nDespite all evidence to the contrary, we still want to believe that men who are accused of sexual assault are all \u201cmonsters.\u201d True, some of them may be monsters we know \u2014 our employers, our clergymen, our favorite celebrities, our politicians, our Supreme Court justices \u2014 but they are \u201cmonsters\u201d nonetheless.\nA \u201cgood guy\u201d can\u2019t possibly have committed assault, regardless of the mental gymnastics he has to engage in to convince himself of that (\u201c20 minutes of action,\u201d anyone?). Even men who admit to keeping sex slaves in conflict zones will claim they did not commit rape \u2014 it\u2019s that other guy, that \u201cmonster\u201d over there, that \u201cbad guy\u201d who did. In fact, one of the traits rapists have been found to reliably share is that they don\u2019t believe they are the problem.\nIn my own interviews with high school and college students conducted over the past two years, young men that I like enormously \u2014 friendly, thoughtful, bright, engaging young men \u2014 have \u201csort of\u201d raped girls, have pushed women\u2019s heads down to get oral sex, have taken a Snapchat video of a prom date performing oral sex and sent it to the baseball team. They all described themselves as \u201cgood guys.\u201d But the fact is, a \u201creally good guy\u201d can do a really bad thing.\nYoung men\u2019s ability to understand sexual refusal has been shown to be remarkably sophisticated and subtle, regardless of whether the word \u201cno\u201d is actually uttered; that renders dubious the common defense that they \u201ccan\u2019t tell\u201d or \u201caren\u2019t mind readers.\u201d What\u2019s more, where \u201cyes\u201d is concerned, guys seem downright clairvoyant: They routinely over-perceive a woman\u2019s interest in having sex with them, even more so if the men have been drinking.\nIn 2016, for instance, researchers at Confi, an online resource dedicated to women\u2019s health issues, asked 1,200 college students and recent graduates nationwide what they would \u201cexpect to happen next\u201d if they went home with someone whom they\u2019d met and danced with at a party. Forty-five percent of the men considered vaginal intercourse \u201clikely\u201d; only 30 percent of the women did. The figures were similarly skewed for oral sex. Additionally, one in four men believed women \u201cusually have to be convinced\u201d in order for sex to happen (only about a tenth of the women agreed).\nNot only are those perception gaps a setup for assault, but also for men\u2019s subsequent denials of responsibility and, quite possibly, claims of false accusation. According to the same survey, men found the actions of a \u201ctipsy\u201d guy \u201cmuch more acceptable\u201d than a sober one, meaning they let themselves off the hook for potential sexual aggression, even as female assault victims who drink are blamed.\nSometimes, boys I talk to acknowledge having willfully crossed lines. One college sophomore had repeatedly ignored his partner\u2019s hesitation during a hookup, despite his own professed scrupulousness about consent.\n\u201cI suppose there was something in the back of my head that I wasn\u2019t fully listening to,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI guess when you\u2019ve been flirting with someone the whole evening and you feel close to what you\u2019ve been wanting to happen, it\u2019s difficult to put on the brakes. And \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I was enjoying myself. I was having what in the moment was a positive sexual experience. I think I just wanted to. Which is scary.\u201d\nAnd that may be the crux of it. Young men still too often learn to prioritize their pleasure over women\u2019s feelings, to interpret a partner\u2019s behavior through the lens of their own wishes. Their claims of \u201cmiscommunication,\u201d Ms. Bedera concluded in her research on college men, may actually be part of \u201can expectation that they control both partners\u2019 narratives about desire and consent.\u201d\nAll of which would indicate that in these high-profile cases, women\u2019s accusations are inherently more credible than male denial, regardless of how vehement that denial may be. It also means that despite the new standards that have been put in place and despite all the editorials and news articles and calls for change, we are still not doing what needs to be done: fully educating boys not only about the importance of consensual, ethical, mutually pleasurable sexuality, but about the ways their own sense of entitlement may blind them to those values, leading them to cause harm, whether or not they choose to see it.\nIn other words, we have to start dealing with the bear in the room.\nPeggy Orenstein is the author, most recently, of \u201cGirls & Sex: Navigating the Complicated New Landscape.\u201d\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Then she noticed an unusual stash of clothing, food and bedding. A young woman who was supposed to be a massage therapist spoke little English and seemed unusually nervous.</p>\n<p>The inspector reported her findings to the police. They would eventually learn that her suspicions were right: The women were not just employees: They were living in the day spa, sleeping on massage tables and cooking meals on hot plates in the back. Some of them had had their passports confiscated.</p>\n<p>The inspector&rsquo;s suspicions prompted a sprawling investigation across four Florida counties and two states &mdash; Florida and New York &mdash; over nearly eight months, resulting in the disruption of what authorities say was a multimillion-dollar <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/sports/robert-kraft-jupiter-orchids-arrest.html\">human-trafficking and prostitution operation</a>.</p>\n<p>The sweep led to criminal charges last week against several rich, prominent men, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/sports/robert-kraft-jupiter-orchids-arrest.html\">Robert K. Kraft</a>, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots; John Havens, former president and chief operating officer of Citigroup; and John Childs, founder of the private equity firm J.W. Childs Associates.</p>\n<p>Beyond the lurid celebrity connection, however, lies the wretched story of women who the police believe were brought from China under false promises of new lives and legitimate spa jobs. Instead, they found themselves trapped in the austere back rooms of strip-mall brothels &mdash; trafficking victims trapped among South Florida&rsquo;s rich and famous.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they were told they were going to work in massage parlors seven days a week, having unprotected sex with up to 1,000 men a year,&rdquo; said Sheriff William D. Snyder of Martin County, whose office opened the investigation. &ldquo;We saw them eating on hot plates in the back. There were no washing machines. They were sleeping on the massage tables.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The women were shuttled from place to place &mdash; not only to nearby parlors but also across the state, said Sheriff Snyder. Sheriff&rsquo;s deputies in Orange County, Fla., became involved in the investigation when women from the state&rsquo;s Treasure Coast region were traced back to the Orlando area.</p>\n<p>Sheriff Snyder said he believed at least some of the women were working to pay off debt owed for what it cost to bring them to the United States. In some cases, the women&rsquo;s passports were taken away. Traffickers cycled women in and out of parlors every 10 or 20 days, Sheriff Snyder estimated.</p>\n<p>Yet making a trafficking case remains difficult, in part because the women who were victims may not want to cooperate with the police. Only one has been talking to deputies, Sheriff Snyder said. He had lined up about a dozen Mandarin interpreters, but many other women refused to speak and were let go with an offer of assistance.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I would never consider them prostitutes &mdash; it was really a rescue operation,&rdquo; the sheriff said, training his anger at the men whose demand for sex kept the massage parlors in business. &ldquo;The monsters are the men,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>In addition to arresting men ranging in age from their 30s to at least one in his 80s, the police charged several women who appeared to be overseeing the operation with racketeering, money laundering and prostitution.</p>\n<p>Sheriff Snyder said investigators, who worked with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, estimated the trafficking ring to be a $20 million international operation. Men paid between $100 and $200 for sex, the sheriff said; between $2 million and $3 million has been seized in Florida, he said, including a safe stuffed with Rolex watches.</p>\n<p>State Attorney Dave Aronberg of Palm Beach County, whose office leads a human trafficking task force with the F.B.I., said trafficking foreigners to work in places like massage parlors can be more difficult to root out than trafficking, for example, American girls who are recruited in person or online.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They come from countries where the police are part of the problem, and they&rsquo;re smuggled into the country,&rdquo; Mr. Aronberg said.</p>\n<p>Laura Cusack, a social worker in charge of the human trafficking prevention and education program at Place of Hope, an agency for foster children and trafficking victims in Boca Raton, said foreign victims were often threatened by traffickers in their home countries.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re told by traffickers, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got people waiting for you,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said. When social workers urge victims like that to come forward to the police, they say, &ldquo;&lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t understand. They&rsquo;re trying to find my little sister back home. They&rsquo;re trying to find my daughter,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ms. Cusack said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Havens, the former Citigroup executive, was elevated to the post in 2011 by his longtime confidant, Vikram Pandit, Citi&rsquo;s chief executive. The two became friends as senior executives at Morgan Stanley before they both left in 2005 to start Old Lane Partners, a hedge fund that was acquired by Citigroup two years later for $800 million. Both resigned from Citi on the same day in 2012, after the Federal Reserve indicated Citi was not healthy enough after the financial crisis to start paying more money back to shareholders.</p>\n<p>Through a spokesman, Mr. Kraft, 77, denied engaging in illegal activity, and Mr. Childs in a statement to Bloomberg also denied the charges.</p>\n<p>That such a lucrative trafficking network existed near the ritzy enclaves of Jupiter Island, home to the likes of golfer Tiger Woods, and Palm Beach, home to President Trump&rsquo;s Mar-a-Lago estate, seemed unfathomable to some of the gawkers who posed for selfies &mdash; and in some cases cracked off-color jokes &mdash; on Friday outside the Orchids of Asia massage parlor in Jupiter, the enterprise that officials said Mr. Kraft had visited.</p>\n<p>But Palm Beach was also the place where a well-connected billionaire financier from New York, Jeffrey E. Epstein, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/jeffrey-epstein-acosta-florida-sex-abuse.html?action=click&module=inline&pgtype=Article&region=Footer\">was accused</a> a decade ago of molesting dozens of underage girls &mdash; some of them runaways or foster children who are vulnerable to sex trafficking. A federal judge <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/us/jeffrey-epstein-judge-prosecution-agreement.html\">ruled on Thursday</a> that prosecutors violated the rights of Mr. Epstein&rsquo;s victims by failing to inform them of a plea deal that would protect him from sex-trafficking charges.</p>\n<p>The massage-parlor investigation began farther north, in Hobe Sound, a strip of mainland in Martin County where on July 6 the health inspector reported the signs of potential trafficking at the Bridge Day Spa, according to the arrest affidavit for one of the men. Sheriff&rsquo;s deputies identified the spa&rsquo;s owner and another nearby property under her name. They searched online forums where users posted about sex acts performed at the massage parlors. Based on the evidence they collected, they obtained a warrant to conduct surveillance.</p>\n<p>That approach was far more labor-intensive than past investigations, in which undercover deputies would go into the parlors and arrest women for prostitution, said Sheriff Snyder, a former Republican state representative who helped write Florida&rsquo;s law against human trafficking.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I made this decision that we had enough of that: Let&rsquo;s go after the traffickers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I feel, on some level, extremely dissatisfied that I can&rsquo;t do more. I know that we don&rsquo;t even make a dent.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the case of the Orchids of Asia parlor in Jupiter, where services were listed for $59 for half an hour or $79 for an hour, an arrest affidavit for the women managing the spa detailed a similar investigative approach. Police officers watched men going into the spa for 30 to 45 minutes at a time.</p>\n<p>Once they left, officers followed the men, pulled them over for traffic violations and confronted them about paying for sex. That evidence led to warrants for surveillance cameras, which police secretly installed inside the massage parlors &mdash; apparently under the ruse of a possible bomb threat.</p>\n<p>All of the men arrested in Jupiter were filmed paying for manual or oral sexual stimulation, according to police. Sheriff Snyder said the sex acts his deputies recorded in Martin County included sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement spent several weeks identifying the clients, and the women managing the trafficking victims, as well as tracing their finances. Police and prosecutors wrote up their criminal charges and raided the massage parlors on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>By then, however, some of the women they had identified as victims had been moved elsewhere. New women had taken their place.</p>",

                "text": "Saul Martinez for The New York Times\nJUPITER, Fla. \u2014 Something was amiss at a massage parlor near one of the wealthiest barrier islands in Florida.\nFirst, a health inspector spotted several suitcases. Then she noticed an unusual stash of clothing, food and bedding. A young woman who was supposed to be a massage therapist spoke little English and seemed unusually nervous.\nThe inspector reported her findings to the police. They would eventually learn that her suspicions were right: The women were not just employees: They were living in the day spa, sleeping on massage tables and cooking meals on hot plates in the back. Some of them had had their passports confiscated.\nThe inspector\u2019s suspicions prompted a sprawling investigation across four Florida counties and two states \u2014 Florida and New York \u2014 over nearly eight months, resulting in the disruption of what authorities say was a multimillion-dollar human-trafficking and prostitution operation.\nThe sweep led to criminal charges last week against several rich, prominent men, including Robert K. Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots; John Havens, former president and chief operating officer of Citigroup; and John Childs, founder of the private equity firm J.W. Childs Associates.\nBeyond the lurid celebrity connection, however, lies the wretched story of women who the police believe were brought from China under false promises of new lives and legitimate spa jobs. Instead, they found themselves trapped in the austere back rooms of strip-mall brothels \u2014 trafficking victims trapped among South Florida\u2019s rich and famous.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe they were told they were going to work in massage parlors seven days a week, having unprotected sex with up to 1,000 men a year,\u201d said Sheriff William D. Snyder of Martin County, whose office opened the investigation. \u201cWe saw them eating on hot plates in the back. There were no washing machines. They were sleeping on the massage tables.\u201d\nThe women were shuttled from place to place \u2014 not only to nearby parlors but also across the state, said Sheriff Snyder. Sheriff\u2019s deputies in Orange County, Fla., became involved in the investigation when women from the state\u2019s Treasure Coast region were traced back to the Orlando area.\nSheriff Snyder said he believed at least some of the women were working to pay off debt owed for what it cost to bring them to the United States. In some cases, the women\u2019s passports were taken away. Traffickers cycled women in and out of parlors every 10 or 20 days, Sheriff Snyder estimated.\nYet making a trafficking case remains difficult, in part because the women who were victims may not want to cooperate with the police. Only one has been talking to deputies, Sheriff Snyder said. He had lined up about a dozen Mandarin interpreters, but many other women refused to speak and were let go with an offer of assistance.\n\u201cI would never consider them prostitutes \u2014 it was really a rescue operation,\u201d the sheriff said, training his anger at the men whose demand for sex kept the massage parlors in business. \u201cThe monsters are the men,\u201d he added.\nIn addition to arresting men ranging in age from their 30s to at least one in his 80s, the police charged several women who appeared to be overseeing the operation with racketeering, money laundering and prostitution.\nSheriff Snyder said investigators, who worked with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, estimated the trafficking ring to be a $20 million international operation. Men paid between $100 and $200 for sex, the sheriff said; between $2 million and $3 million has been seized in Florida, he said, including a safe stuffed with Rolex watches.\nState Attorney Dave Aronberg of Palm Beach County, whose office leads a human trafficking task force with the F.B.I., said trafficking foreigners to work in places like massage parlors can be more difficult to root out than trafficking, for example, American girls who are recruited in person or online.\n\u201cThey come from countries where the police are part of the problem, and they\u2019re smuggled into the country,\u201d Mr. Aronberg said.\nLaura Cusack, a social worker in charge of the human trafficking prevention and education program at Place of Hope, an agency for foster children and trafficking victims in Boca Raton, said foreign victims were often threatened by traffickers in their home countries.\n\u201cThey\u2019re told by traffickers, \u2018I\u2019ve got people waiting for you,\u2019\u201d she said. When social workers urge victims like that to come forward to the police, they say, \u201c\u2018No, you don\u2019t understand. They\u2019re trying to find my little sister back home. They\u2019re trying to find my daughter,\u2019\u201d Ms. Cusack said.\nMr. Havens, the former Citigroup executive, was elevated to the post in 2011 by his longtime confidant, Vikram Pandit, Citi\u2019s chief executive. The two became friends as senior executives at Morgan Stanley before they both left in 2005 to start Old Lane Partners, a hedge fund that was acquired by Citigroup two years later for $800 million. Both resigned from Citi on the same day in 2012, after the Federal Reserve indicated Citi was not healthy enough after the financial crisis to start paying more money back to shareholders.\nThrough a spokesman, Mr. Kraft, 77, denied engaging in illegal activity, and Mr. Childs in a statement to Bloomberg also denied the charges.\nThat such a lucrative trafficking network existed near the ritzy enclaves of Jupiter Island, home to the likes of golfer Tiger Woods, and Palm Beach, home to President Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, seemed unfathomable to some of the gawkers who posed for selfies \u2014 and in some cases cracked off-color jokes \u2014 on Friday outside the Orchids of Asia massage parlor in Jupiter, the enterprise that officials said Mr. Kraft had visited.\nBut Palm Beach was also the place where a well-connected billionaire financier from New York, Jeffrey E. Epstein, was accused a decade ago of molesting dozens of underage girls \u2014 some of them runaways or foster children who are vulnerable to sex trafficking. A federal judge ruled on Thursday that prosecutors violated the rights of Mr. Epstein\u2019s victims by failing to inform them of a plea deal that would protect him from sex-trafficking charges.\nThe massage-parlor investigation began farther north, in Hobe Sound, a strip of mainland in Martin County where on July 6 the health inspector reported the signs of potential trafficking at the Bridge Day Spa, according to the arrest affidavit for one of the men. Sheriff\u2019s deputies identified the spa\u2019s owner and another nearby property under her name. They searched online forums where users posted about sex acts performed at the massage parlors. Based on the evidence they collected, they obtained a warrant to conduct surveillance.\nThat approach was far more labor-intensive than past investigations, in which undercover deputies would go into the parlors and arrest women for prostitution, said Sheriff Snyder, a former Republican state representative who helped write Florida\u2019s law against human trafficking.\n\u201cI made this decision that we had enough of that: Let\u2019s go after the traffickers,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel, on some level, extremely dissatisfied that I can\u2019t do more. I know that we don\u2019t even make a dent.\u201d\nIn the case of the Orchids of Asia parlor in Jupiter, where services were listed for $59 for half an hour or $79 for an hour, an arrest affidavit for the women managing the spa detailed a similar investigative approach. Police officers watched men going into the spa for 30 to 45 minutes at a time.\nOnce they left, officers followed the men, pulled them over for traffic violations and confronted them about paying for sex. That evidence led to warrants for surveillance cameras, which police secretly installed inside the massage parlors \u2014 apparently under the ruse of a possible bomb threat.\nAll of the men arrested in Jupiter were filmed paying for manual or oral sexual stimulation, according to police. Sheriff Snyder said the sex acts his deputies recorded in Martin County included sexual intercourse.\nLaw enforcement spent several weeks identifying the clients, and the women managing the trafficking victims, as well as tracing their finances. Police and prosecutors wrote up their criminal charges and raided the massage parlors on Tuesday.\nBy then, however, some of the women they had identified as victims had been moved elsewhere. New women had taken their place.",

                "html": "<p>Marine biologists in Brazil were stunned to discover a young humpback whale on Friday that had washed ashore on a remote, forested island in the Amazon River, at a time of the year when it should have already migrated thousands of miles to Antarctica.</p>\n<p>Members of the conservation group Bicho D&rsquo;&Aacute;gua found the whale after following vultures that were circling a mangrove on the island in the Amazon, Maraj&oacute; Island, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bichodagua/posts/2149321921815133\">the group said</a>. About 50 feet from the shore, scientists spotted the lifeless humpback &mdash; about 26 feet long &mdash; lodged in thick shrubs and brush. It had been dead for at least several days, government officials in Par&aacute;, a state in northern Brazil, <a href=\"https://www.oliberal.com/belem/soure-quer-que-ossada-de-baleia-que-encalhou-fique-em-museu-no-maraj\u00f3-1.78024\">told local news outlets</a>.</p>\n<p>While tens of thousands of humpback whales are <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249474003_Feeding_grounds_of_the_western_South_Atlantic_humpback_whale_population\">estimated to live</a> in the Atlantic Ocean off Brazil, nearly all of them have migrated south by this time of year, the summer in the Southern Hemisphere, to feed near Antarctica. But this humpback was found near the mouth of the Amazon River, some 4,000 miles from its expected feeding grounds, a baffling discovery that has stumped the scientists who found it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We imagine it was floating and the tide took it into the mangrove,&rdquo; Renata Emin, the president of Bicho D&rsquo;&Aacute;gua, <a href=\"https://g1.globo.com/pa/para/noticia/2019/02/23/amostras-de-baleia-jubarte-encontrada-na-ilha-do-marajo-podem-identificar-a-causa-da-morte-do-animal.ghtml\">told the Brazilian news site G1</a>. &ldquo;The question is, What was a humpback whale doing in the month of February on the northern coast of Brazil? It&rsquo;s unusual.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Biologists examined the carcass over the weekend during low tide, looking for signs of how the whale might have died, and took samples for a necropsy, the group said. The whale, while about half the length of a full-grown humpback, was too large and in too remote an area to be entirely removed.</p>\n<p>Ms. Emin told G1 that the group hypothesized that the young whale got detached from its mother before it died.</p>\n<p>Humpbacks travel great distances every year, slowly migrating to and from the poles. Those in the Northern Hemisphere migrate this time of year to tropical waters before returning north in the summer. In the Southern Hemisphere, they migrate south during this time of year and return north during their winter, in the breeding season.</p>\n<p>Ms. Emin said her group was examining the whale to try to determine its cause of death.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are collecting information, identifying marks on the body, to determine if it was trapped in a net or hit by a boat,&rdquo; she told G1, adding that a necropsy report was expected in about 10 days.</p>\n<p>Ms. Emin did not respond to an email seeking comment.</p>\n<p>During the 19th and 20th centuries, whalers killed at least 200,000 humpbacks in the Southern Hemisphere, decimating the population, according to scientists. But <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/science/humpback-whale-antarctica.html\">worldwide conservation efforts</a> in recent decades, and treaties enacted to outlaw whaling, have <a href=\"https://iwc.int/estimate\">saved the once endangered species</a>. Commercial whaling was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/27/world/whaling-around-antarctica-is-banned-by-world-body.html\">outlawed in South America and Antarctica</a> in 1994.</p>\n<p>The rising humpback population has also increased the odds that one will become entangled in fishing nets or be struck by a ship, <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/endangered_species/cetaceans/threats/shipping/\">believed to be leading causes of their deaths</a>. Every year, an <a href=\"https://iwc.int/entanglement\">estimated 300,000 whales and dolphins die</a> after getting caught in fishing gear, according to the International Whaling Commission. The commission, which also tracks so-called ship strikes, has recorded <a href=\"https://iwc.int/the-iwc-brings-ship-strikes-to-the-agenda-of-whale\">more than 1,200 collisions</a> between whales and ships since 2009.</p>",

                "text": "Marine biologists in Brazil were stunned to discover a young humpback whale on Friday that had washed ashore on a remote, forested island in the Amazon River, at a time of the year when it should have already migrated thousands of miles to Antarctica.\nMembers of the conservation group Bicho D\u2019\u00c1gua found the whale after following vultures that were circling a mangrove on the island in the Amazon, Maraj\u00f3 Island, the group said. About 50 feet from the shore, scientists spotted the lifeless humpback \u2014 about 26 feet long \u2014 lodged in thick shrubs and brush. It had been dead for at least several days, government officials in Par\u00e1, a state in northern Brazil, told local news outlets.\nWhile tens of thousands of humpback whales are estimated to live in the Atlantic Ocean off Brazil, nearly all of them have migrated south by this time of year, the summer in the Southern Hemisphere, to feed near Antarctica. But this humpback was found near the mouth of the Amazon River, some 4,000 miles from its expected feeding grounds, a baffling discovery that has stumped the scientists who found it.\n\u201cWe imagine it was floating and the tide took it into the mangrove,\u201d Renata Emin, the president of Bicho D\u2019\u00c1gua, told the Brazilian news site G1. \u201cThe question is, What was a humpback whale doing in the month of February on the northern coast of Brazil? It\u2019s unusual.\u201d\nBiologists examined the carcass over the weekend during low tide, looking for signs of how the whale might have died, and took samples for a necropsy, the group said. The whale, while about half the length of a full-grown humpback, was too large and in too remote an area to be entirely removed.\nMs. Emin told G1 that the group hypothesized that the young whale got detached from its mother before it died.\nHumpbacks travel great distances every year, slowly migrating to and from the poles. Those in the Northern Hemisphere migrate this time of year to tropical waters before returning north in the summer. In the Southern Hemisphere, they migrate south during this time of year and return north during their winter, in the breeding season.\nMs. Emin said her group was examining the whale to try to determine its cause of death.\n\u201cWe are collecting information, identifying marks on the body, to determine if it was trapped in a net or hit by a boat,\u201d she told G1, adding that a necropsy report was expected in about 10 days.\nMs. Emin did not respond to an email seeking comment.\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, whalers killed at least 200,000 humpbacks in the Southern Hemisphere, decimating the population, according to scientists. But worldwide conservation efforts in recent decades, and treaties enacted to outlaw whaling, have saved the once endangered species. Commercial whaling was outlawed in South America and Antarctica in 1994.\nThe rising humpback population has also increased the odds that one will become entangled in fishing nets or be struck by a ship, believed to be leading causes of their deaths. Every year, an estimated 300,000 whales and dolphins die after getting caught in fishing gear, according to the International Whaling Commission. The commission, which also tracks so-called ship strikes, has recorded more than 1,200 collisions between whales and ships since 2009.",

It would light up with an orange dot every time someone gave with the location of each donation.</p>\n<p>Within minutes of the 7 a.m. announcement, the whole screen was glowing orange, according to people in the room.</p>\n<p>By Monday, after less than a week as a presidential candidate, Mr. Sanders has collected $10 million from 359,914 donors, campaign officials said. But perhaps just as daunting a figure for his rivals is this: Nearly 39 percent of those donors used an email address that had never before been used to give to Mr. Sanders.</p>\n<p>For Mr. Sanders, the flood of money from fresh email addresses suggested to his team that he was dramatically expanding a donor network that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/2020-democrats-campaign-funding.html\">had already dwarfed his 2020 competition</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our second day,&rdquo; said Ari Rabin-Havt, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, &ldquo;was bigger than anybody else&rsquo;s first day.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-presidential-candidates.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article\"><em>Keep up with the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>There is little surprise that Mr. Sanders, whose 2016 Democratic primary run was powered by $230 million in grass-roots giving, would post big fund-raising numbers if he ran again. But the size of his advantage &mdash; he raised <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/us/politics/bernie-sanders-fundraising.html\">$5.9 million</a> in his first day as a candidate, nearly 20 times what Senator Elizabeth Warren did in her first day and nearly four times more than Senator Kamala Harris&rsquo;s $1.5 million &mdash; has established him as a financial front-runner in a crowded Democratic field.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think the fact that he has raised so much, so fast, so early should be concerning for anyone else who wants to pick up the liberal flag in this nominating contest,&rdquo; said Craig Varoga, a Democratic strategist who is unaligned in the race.</p>\n<p>Of Mr. Sanders&rsquo;s wave of day one donations, only 17 people gave him the maximum allowable amount of $2,800, meaning he can ask more than 99.99 percent of his donors to give again. As of late Monday, only 20 donors have given Mr. Sanders the legal maximum; another 46 gave $2,700, the limit in the last campaign.</p>\n<p>More than 48,000 donors have already agreed to give to Mr. Sanders over and over, signing up for recurring donations to be drawn from their credit cards worth a combined more than $1 million each month, according to statistics provided to The New York Times by the campaign. The average overall contribution was just under $26.</p>\n<p>But the fact that such a large share of donations came from new email addresses is perhaps the most significant figure beyond the overall totals. While some fraction of those new email addresses are surely old donors with updated contact information &mdash; college students who graduated, for instance, or people who changed jobs &mdash; the idea that a sizable share of Mr. Sanders&rsquo;s donors could be new undercuts the hope among rivals that Mr. Sanders had maxed out a limited, if impassioned, minority of the party when he ran four years ago.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an assumption he&rsquo;s relying on that loyal base of support from 2016,&rdquo; said Jen Psaki, a Democratic strategist and former White House communications director for President Barack Obama. But a rush of new donors &ldquo;would make people question the assumption that Bernie supporters are solely Bernie loyalists from 2016, end of story,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Sanders raised $73 million in 2015. This year, he entered the race roughly 70 days earlier in the calendar and raised four times as much on his first day, raising the possibility of a $100 million haul in 2019.</p>\n<p>Hillary Clinton, who beat Mr. Sanders in the 2016 primary, raised more than him in that race. But that was with the weight of the Democratic Party establishment behind her, a huge list of supporters from her 2008 run and four million more names from a group called Ready for Hillary that had gathered grass-roots supporters ahead of her campaign.</p>\n<p>No 2020 rival of Mr. Sanders has anything close to that.</p>\n<p>In a move that seemed designed to compete with Mr. Sanders for small donors, Ms. Warren&rsquo;s campaign announced on Monday that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-donors-fundraising.html\">she would forgo all traditional private fund-raisers</a> and one-on-one meetings with big donors.</p>\n<p>Mr. Rabin-Havt tried to tamp down long-term financial expectations for the Sanders campaign. &ldquo;It will be remarkable to emulate those 2015 numbers again,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Separately, Mr. Sanders said during a town hall-style forum on CNN Monday night that he would release 10 years of tax returns &ldquo;soon,&rdquo; suggesting he would provide more transparency into his taxes than he did in 2016 when he only <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/04/15/bernie-sanders-releases-his-2014-tax-returns/\">released one year</a> of filings. Mr. Sanders said he did not release more returns then because &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t win the nomination.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our tax returns will bore you to death,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nothing special about them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Money alone is not determinative in presidential politics. In the 2016 Republican primary, a super PAC supporting Jeb Bush burned through $100 million as Mr. Bush finished no better than fourth in any of the first three states. But money does pay for television ads and field staff, and Mr. Sanders&rsquo;s fund-raising advantage will allow him to take risks and make investments others cannot afford.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He can build a ground game not just in the first four primary states but into the Super Tuesday states,&rdquo; Ms. Psaki said. &ldquo;He can expand his playing field in places like California.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Sanders campaign shared new statistics on its donors so far, which skew younger than is typical. An internal analysis showed more than 108,000 of Mr. Sanders&rsquo;s first day contributors were 39 years old or younger, and they gave a combined $2.5 million of the $5.9 million raised. The most common age for a Sanders contributor was 30. Relatedly, more than $3 million of the donations that first day came from mobile devices, a sign of both shifting habits and the relative youth of his donor base. The campaign did not provide a breakdown by gender.</p>\n<p>Mr. Sanders has closely tracked his fund-raising haul, campaign officials said, and Mr. Rabin-Havt said that the senator wrote much of the campaign&rsquo;s initial 1,400-word email announcement himself.</p>\n<p>The email did not explicitly ask for money, instead directing people to sign a petition supporting Mr. Sanders. Of those who signed, about 40 percent also contributed, his campaign said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Sanders&rsquo;s two top digital advisers in 2020, Tim Tagaris and Robin Curran, are both veterans of his 2016 run, but others from that team are on or expected to join other campaigns.</p>\n<p>Mr. Rabin-Havt noted the universe of Democratic donors was still growing. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t hit a diminishing rate of return on this yet,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>He added that the Sanders campaign believes it has a unique advantage.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The secret sauce for Bernie Sanders fund-raising,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is Bernie.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Kathryn Gamble for The New York Times\nA clutch of advisers to Senator Bernie Sanders began arriving at the Capitol Hill townhouse that served as his makeshift headquarters before dawn last Tuesday, where they readied themselves to track, among other things, the deluge of donations that would land after Mr. Sanders made his presidential campaign official.\nAs the team snacked on doughnuts that Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign manager, had brought for launch day, one laptop screen showed a map of the United States. It would light up with an orange dot every time someone gave with the location of each donation.\nWithin minutes of the 7 a.m. announcement, the whole screen was glowing orange, according to people in the room.\nBy Monday, after less than a week as a presidential candidate, Mr. Sanders has collected $10 million from 359,914 donors, campaign officials said. But perhaps just as daunting a figure for his rivals is this: Nearly 39 percent of those donors used an email address that had never before been used to give to Mr. Sanders.\nFor Mr. Sanders, the flood of money from fresh email addresses suggested to his team that he was dramatically expanding a donor network that had already dwarfed his 2020 competition.\n\u201cOur second day,\u201d said Ari Rabin-Havt, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, \u201cwas bigger than anybody else\u2019s first day.\u201d\n[Keep up with the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]\nThere is little surprise that Mr. Sanders, whose 2016 Democratic primary run was powered by $230 million in grass-roots giving, would post big fund-raising numbers if he ran again. But the size of his advantage \u2014 he raised $5.9 million in his first day as a candidate, nearly 20 times what Senator Elizabeth Warren did in her first day and nearly four times more than Senator Kamala Harris\u2019s $1.5 million \u2014 has established him as a financial front-runner in a crowded Democratic field.\n\u201cI think the fact that he has raised so much, so fast, so early should be concerning for anyone else who wants to pick up the liberal flag in this nominating contest,\u201d said Craig Varoga, a Democratic strategist who is unaligned in the race.\nOf Mr. Sanders\u2019s wave of day one donations, only 17 people gave him the maximum allowable amount of $2,800, meaning he can ask more than 99.99 percent of his donors to give again. As of late Monday, only 20 donors have given Mr. Sanders the legal maximum; another 46 gave $2,700, the limit in the last campaign.\nMore than 48,000 donors have already agreed to give to Mr. Sanders over and over, signing up for recurring donations to be drawn from their credit cards worth a combined more than $1 million each month, according to statistics provided to The New York Times by the campaign. The average overall contribution was just under $26.\nBut the fact that such a large share of donations came from new email addresses is perhaps the most significant figure beyond the overall totals. While some fraction of those new email addresses are surely old donors with updated contact information \u2014 college students who graduated, for instance, or people who changed jobs \u2014 the idea that a sizable share of Mr. Sanders\u2019s donors could be new undercuts the hope among rivals that Mr. Sanders had maxed out a limited, if impassioned, minority of the party when he ran four years ago.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an assumption he\u2019s relying on that loyal base of support from 2016,\u201d said Jen Psaki, a Democratic strategist and former White House communications director for President Barack Obama. But a rush of new donors \u201cwould make people question the assumption that Bernie supporters are solely Bernie loyalists from 2016, end of story,\u201d she said.\nMr. Sanders raised $73 million in 2015. This year, he entered the race roughly 70 days earlier in the calendar and raised four times as much on his first day, raising the possibility of a $100 million haul in 2019.\nHillary Clinton, who beat Mr. Sanders in the 2016 primary, raised more than him in that race. But that was with the weight of the Democratic Party establishment behind her, a huge list of supporters from her 2008 run and four million more names from a group called Ready for Hillary that had gathered grass-roots supporters ahead of her campaign.\nNo 2020 rival of Mr. Sanders has anything close to that.\nIn a move that seemed designed to compete with Mr. Sanders for small donors, Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign announced on Monday that she would forgo all traditional private fund-raisers and one-on-one meetings with big donors.\nMr. Rabin-Havt tried to tamp down long-term financial expectations for the Sanders campaign. \u201cIt will be remarkable to emulate those 2015 numbers again,\u201d he said.\nSeparately, Mr. Sanders said during a town hall-style forum on CNN Monday night that he would release 10 years of tax returns \u201csoon,\u201d suggesting he would provide more transparency into his taxes than he did in 2016 when he only released one year of filings. Mr. Sanders said he did not release more returns then because \u201cI didn\u2019t win the nomination.\u201d\n\u201cOur tax returns will bore you to death,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing special about them.\u201d\nMoney alone is not determinative in presidential politics. In the 2016 Republican primary, a super PAC supporting Jeb Bush burned through $100 million as Mr. Bush finished no better than fourth in any of the first three states. But money does pay for television ads and field staff, and Mr. Sanders\u2019s fund-raising advantage will allow him to take risks and make investments others cannot afford.\n\u201cHe can build a ground game not just in the first four primary states but into the Super Tuesday states,\u201d Ms. Psaki said. \u201cHe can expand his playing field in places like California.\u201d\nThe Sanders campaign shared new statistics on its donors so far, which skew younger than is typical. An internal analysis showed more than 108,000 of Mr. Sanders\u2019s first day contributors were 39 years old or younger, and they gave a combined $2.5 million of the $5.9 million raised. The most common age for a Sanders contributor was 30. Relatedly, more than $3 million of the donations that first day came from mobile devices, a sign of both shifting habits and the relative youth of his donor base. The campaign did not provide a breakdown by gender.\nMr. Sanders has closely tracked his fund-raising haul, campaign officials said, and Mr. Rabin-Havt said that the senator wrote much of the campaign\u2019s initial 1,400-word email announcement himself.\nThe email did not explicitly ask for money, instead directing people to sign a petition supporting Mr. Sanders. Of those who signed, about 40 percent also contributed, his campaign said.\nMr. Sanders\u2019s two top digital advisers in 2020, Tim Tagaris and Robin Curran, are both veterans of his 2016 run, but others from that team are on or expected to join other campaigns.\nMr. Rabin-Havt noted the universe of Democratic donors was still growing. \u201cWe haven\u2019t hit a diminishing rate of return on this yet,\u201d he said.\nHe added that the Sanders campaign believes it has a unique advantage.\n\u201cThe secret sauce for Bernie Sanders fund-raising,\u201d he said, \u201cis Bernie.\u201d",

Williams, a Democratic councilman from Brooklyn, was elected as New York City public advocate Tuesday night, notching a victory over 16 other candidates in a free-for-all race that could give him a platform to seek higher office.</p>\n<p>Mr. Williams entered the race as a front-runner after his surprise insurgency campaign for lieutenant governor against the Democratic incumbent, Kathy Hochul, netted him more than 434,000 votes in New York City in a losing effort last year.</p>\n<p>He used that momentum to argue that he had the support of voters who saw his history as an activist &mdash; including several arrests for civil disobedience &mdash; as evidence that he would be an unapologetic antagonist to Mayor Bill de Blasio when needed.</p>\n<p>As Mr. Williams took the stage at Cafe Omar in Flatbush to give his acceptance speech, he appeared buoyant, mouthing the words to &ldquo;Differentology,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YxKjJg3E-U\">a song</a> by the soca artist, Bunji Garlin. He swayed to the beat and mouthed the words to the chorus, &ldquo;We ready for the road,&rdquo; before addressing the crowd.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We cannot wait, we cannot stand still, because the challenges in our city are too great,&rdquo; Mr. Williams said. &ldquo;But the opportunity to create change is even greater.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He pledged to listen to his fellow New Yorkers and then take action on behalf of the city&rsquo;s most disadvantaged residents, naming people living in public housing and victims of gun violence. He vowed to help &ldquo; upend a system of injustice that criminalizes black and brown communities, and to give those who have been caught in the system a second chance. Most of them, a first chance.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The speech ended on an emotional note, as Mr. Williams, in tears, spoke of being in therapy for the last three years, building up his self-worth.</p>\n<p>The public advocate serves as an ombudsman to the city and is first in line to succeed a mayor departing before the end of his term. It is also seen as a potential launching pad to higher office; Mr. de Blasio went from being public advocate to becoming mayor.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I would call this race an education in New York City civics,&rdquo; said a Democratic political strategist, Lupe Todd-Medina. &ldquo;It had money, politics and sex. It&rsquo;s a case study.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With Mr. de Blasio openly flirting with a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/nyregion/iowa-bill-de-blasio-2020.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fjeffery-c.-mays&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=collection\">run for the Democratic nomination for president</a>, the public advocate role may be more important than people know, said Jeanne Zaino, a professor of political science at Iona College.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Anytime you see a mayor eyeing something bigger on the horizon, this is a natural position from which you will get a major candidate,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Williams has said he will not run for mayor in 2021. &ldquo;To the mayor, I&rsquo;m not running for your job!&rdquo; he said, laughing. &ldquo;But together we have to make sure the government is working on behalf of the people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With 97 percent of precincts reporting and about 396,000 ballots cast, Mr. Williams had 33 percent of the vote, according to preliminary totals from the Board of Elections.</p>\n<p>Eric A. Ulrich, a Republican councilman from Queens, came in second with 19 percent of the vote and the former City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, a Democrat, was third with 11 percent.</p>\n<p>At times, the contest was a referendum on Mr. de Blasio&rsquo;s policies, the state of the city&rsquo;s subways and a failed plan for Amazon to build a campus in Long Island City. And in the campaign&rsquo;s final days, a previously undisclosed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/nyregion/jumaane-williams-girlfriend-arrest.html\">decade-old arrest</a> of Mr. Williams became an issue.</p>\n<p>Mr. Williams was forced to acknowledge that he had been arrested a decade ago on harassment and criminal mischief charges, and spent a night in custody after what he called a &ldquo;verbal disagreement&rdquo; with his girlfriend at the time. Charges were dropped, and the arrest record itself is sealed.</p>\n<p>But the arrest was leaked to the media, and Mr. Williams&rsquo;s opponents used it to question his fitness for the office.</p>\n<p>Mr. Williams said he did nothing wrong, accusing his opponents of resorting to tired racial stereotypes by trying to paint him as an &ldquo;angry black man&rdquo; to discredit him with voters. In his victory speech, Mr. Williams thanked &ldquo;most&rdquo; of the other candidates.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think people were politicizing this issue. His opponents went back 10 years out of desperation,&rdquo; said Rodneyse Bichotte, a State assemblywoman from Brooklyn and Mr. Williams&rsquo;s campaign chairwoman.</p>\n<p>Indeed, some people who spoke with Mr. Williams as he campaigned on Election Day brought up his other arrests, during protests of issues such as criminal justice reform. And he met a man who served as a juror on his trial for blocking an ambulance during an immigrants rights protest. Mr. Williams was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/nyregion/jumaane-williams-councilman-immigrant-protest-guilty.html\">found guilty of disorderly conduct </a>and sentenced to time served.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I want to leave it to people&rsquo;s judgment,&rdquo; Mr. Williams said. &ldquo;And people&rsquo;s judgment is telling them that there&rsquo;s nothing there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Candidates also made an issue of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/nyregion/white-men-nyc-jobs-top-posts.html\">lack of racial and gender diversity</a> among the city&rsquo;s leadership; in a remarkable display of diversity not normally seen in city elections, 12 of the 17 candidates are women or minorities, including Ms. Mark-Viverito, who was one of the perceived front-runners.</p>\n<p>Although Ms. Mark-Viverito enjoyed more name recognition than many of her opponents, the election was the first test of her citywide appeal.</p>\n<p>In her concession speech at an East Harlem pub, Ms. Mark-Viverito said her campaign &ldquo;highlighted the shameful lack of diversity in citywide leadership, where we have three white men in every single position of citywide office,&rdquo; she said, urging more women to follow her example and seek political office.</p>\n<p>Of all the candidates in the race, Ms. Mark-Viverito&rsquo;s political future seemed the most unclear. She declined to say whether she would run for the same seat again.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For Mark-Viverito, you have to wonder where she goes from here,&rdquo; Professor Sherrill said. &ldquo;Losing has a real cost for her.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The candidates consisted of multiple City Council members blocked from running for their seats again by term limits and State Assembly members looking for a bigger stage. Other hopefuls included activists, lawyers and first-time candidates.</p>\n<p>Voter turnout in the race was about 9 percent, a low figure that was expected from the moment Mr. de Blasio called a special, nonpartisan election in the middle of winter to fill the seat vacated by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/nyregion/letitia-james-wins-ny-ag.html\">Letitia James when she was elected New York State attorney general</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, the race to become the city&rsquo;s public advocate has been an unpredictable, quirky and expensive contest.</p>\n<p>By the time polls closed at 9 p.m., the city Board of Elections was looking at spending upward of $15 million to stage an election that was expected to draw one of the lowest voter turnouts in city history. The Campaign Finance Board delivered $7.1 million in matching funds to candidates &mdash; twice the amount of the office&rsquo;s $3.5 million budget, for a position that some people have called to be abolished.</p>\n<p>The large number of Democrats in the race was thought to possibly give an advantage to Mr. Ulrich, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/nyregion/amazon-public-advocate-election-eric-ulrich.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fjeffery-c.-mays&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=4&pgtype=collection\">one of two Republicans</a> in the race, who appeared to finish second on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>He was an unabashed supporter of the Amazon deal, is against congestion pricing and is not in favor of closing the Rikers Island jail complex. He criticized Mr. de Blasio more vocally than his fellow candidates, and also obtained the endorsement of the city&rsquo;s two tabloid newspapers.</p>\n<p>Mr. Williams&rsquo;s win assures him only of being in office for the remainder of the year.

                "text": "Todd Heisler/The New York Times\n[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\nJumaane D. Williams, a Democratic councilman from Brooklyn, was elected as New York City public advocate Tuesday night, notching a victory over 16 other candidates in a free-for-all race that could give him a platform to seek higher office.\nMr. Williams entered the race as a front-runner after his surprise insurgency campaign for lieutenant governor against the Democratic incumbent, Kathy Hochul, netted him more than 434,000 votes in New York City in a losing effort last year.\nHe used that momentum to argue that he had the support of voters who saw his history as an activist \u2014 including several arrests for civil disobedience \u2014 as evidence that he would be an unapologetic antagonist to Mayor Bill de Blasio when needed.\nAs Mr. Williams took the stage at Cafe Omar in Flatbush to give his acceptance speech, he appeared buoyant, mouthing the words to \u201cDifferentology,\u201d a song by the soca artist, Bunji Garlin. He swayed to the beat and mouthed the words to the chorus, \u201cWe ready for the road,\u201d before addressing the crowd.\n\u201cWe cannot wait, we cannot stand still, because the challenges in our city are too great,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cBut the opportunity to create change is even greater.\u201d\nHe pledged to listen to his fellow New Yorkers and then take action on behalf of the city\u2019s most disadvantaged residents, naming people living in public housing and victims of gun violence. He vowed to help \u201c upend a system of injustice that criminalizes black and brown communities, and to give those who have been caught in the system a second chance. Most of them, a first chance.\u201d\nThe speech ended on an emotional note, as Mr. Williams, in tears, spoke of being in therapy for the last three years, building up his self-worth.\nThe public advocate serves as an ombudsman to the city and is first in line to succeed a mayor departing before the end of his term. It is also seen as a potential launching pad to higher office; Mr. de Blasio went from being public advocate to becoming mayor.\n\u201cI would call this race an education in New York City civics,\u201d said a Democratic political strategist, Lupe Todd-Medina. \u201cIt had money, politics and sex. It\u2019s a case study.\u201d\nWith Mr. de Blasio openly flirting with a run for the Democratic nomination for president, the public advocate role may be more important than people know, said Jeanne Zaino, a professor of political science at Iona College.\n\u201cAnytime you see a mayor eyeing something bigger on the horizon, this is a natural position from which you will get a major candidate,\u201d she said.\nMr. Williams has said he will not run for mayor in 2021. \u201cTo the mayor, I\u2019m not running for your job!\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cBut together we have to make sure the government is working on behalf of the people.\u201d\nWith 97 percent of precincts reporting and about 396,000 ballots cast, Mr. Williams had 33 percent of the vote, according to preliminary totals from the Board of Elections.\nEric A. Ulrich, a Republican councilman from Queens, came in second with 19 percent of the vote and the former City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, a Democrat, was third with 11 percent.\nAt times, the contest was a referendum on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s policies, the state of the city\u2019s subways and a failed plan for Amazon to build a campus in Long Island City. And in the campaign\u2019s final days, a previously undisclosed decade-old arrest of Mr. Williams became an issue.\nMr. Williams was forced to acknowledge that he had been arrested a decade ago on harassment and criminal mischief charges, and spent a night in custody after what he called a \u201cverbal disagreement\u201d with his girlfriend at the time. Charges were dropped, and the arrest record itself is sealed.\nBut the arrest was leaked to the media, and Mr. Williams\u2019s opponents used it to question his fitness for the office.\nMr. Williams said he did nothing wrong, accusing his opponents of resorting to tired racial stereotypes by trying to paint him as an \u201cangry black man\u201d to discredit him with voters. In his victory speech, Mr. Williams thanked \u201cmost\u201d of the other candidates.\n\u201cI think people were politicizing this issue. His opponents went back 10 years out of desperation,\u201d said Rodneyse Bichotte, a State assemblywoman from Brooklyn and Mr. Williams\u2019s campaign chairwoman.\nIndeed, some people who spoke with Mr. Williams as he campaigned on Election Day brought up his other arrests, during protests of issues such as criminal justice reform. And he met a man who served as a juror on his trial for blocking an ambulance during an immigrants rights protest. Mr. Williams was found guilty of disorderly conduct and sentenced to time served.\n\u201cI want to leave it to people\u2019s judgment,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cAnd people\u2019s judgment is telling them that there\u2019s nothing there.\u201d\nCandidates also made an issue of the lack of racial and gender diversity among the city\u2019s leadership; in a remarkable display of diversity not normally seen in city elections, 12 of the 17 candidates are women or minorities, including Ms. Mark-Viverito, who was one of the perceived front-runners.\nAlthough Ms. Mark-Viverito enjoyed more name recognition than many of her opponents, the election was the first test of her citywide appeal.\nIn her concession speech at an East Harlem pub, Ms. Mark-Viverito said her campaign \u201chighlighted the shameful lack of diversity in citywide leadership, where we have three white men in every single position of citywide office,\u201d she said, urging more women to follow her example and seek political office.\nOf all the candidates in the race, Ms. Mark-Viverito\u2019s political future seemed the most unclear. She declined to say whether she would run for the same seat again.\n\u201cFor Mark-Viverito, you have to wonder where she goes from here,\u201d Professor Sherrill said. \u201cLosing has a real cost for her.\u201d\nThe candidates consisted of multiple City Council members blocked from running for their seats again by term limits and State Assembly members looking for a bigger stage. Other hopefuls included activists, lawyers and first-time candidates.\nVoter turnout in the race was about 9 percent, a low figure that was expected from the moment Mr. de Blasio called a special, nonpartisan election in the middle of winter to fill the seat vacated by Letitia James when she was elected New York State attorney general.\nStill, the race to become the city\u2019s public advocate has been an unpredictable, quirky and expensive contest.\nBy the time polls closed at 9 p.m., the city Board of Elections was looking at spending upward of $15 million to stage an election that was expected to draw one of the lowest voter turnouts in city history. The Campaign Finance Board delivered $7.1 million in matching funds to candidates \u2014 twice the amount of the office\u2019s $3.5 million budget, for a position that some people have called to be abolished.\nThe large number of Democrats in the race was thought to possibly give an advantage to Mr. Ulrich, one of two Republicans in the race, who appeared to finish second on Tuesday.\nHe was an unabashed supporter of the Amazon deal, is against congestion pricing and is not in favor of closing the Rikers Island jail complex. He criticized Mr. de Blasio more vocally than his fellow candidates, and also obtained the endorsement of the city\u2019s two tabloid newspapers.\nMr. Williams\u2019s win assures him only of being in office for the remainder of the year. Another election will be held in November to fill out the final two years of Ms. James\u2019s term; petitioning for a June primary started on the same day as the special election.\nIt is unclear if Mr. Williams can consolidate enough support to scare off potential opponents from challenging him in the primary. Bill Lipton, the state director of the Working Families Party, whose endorsement of Mr. Williams provided an important boost, said Mr. Williams had.\n\u201cThe progressive movement is stronger than ever,\u201d Mr. Lipton said. \u201cThis is a decisive victory.\u201d",

But ceasing to participate in a compromised Title X program is understandable, given that the new rule seems intended to make it all but impossible for many clinics to comply.</p>\n<p>Dr. Wen noted, rightly, that the new rule isn&rsquo;t just about Planned Parenthood. &ldquo;The harm isn&rsquo;t to one organization; it&rsquo;s to people&rsquo;s health care,&rdquo; she said. It&rsquo;s clear, however, that the goal of the rule change is to satisfy Mr. Trump&rsquo;s supporters by at least partly defunding Planned Parenthood &mdash; the boogeyman of the anti-abortion cause.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that a rule change clearly rooted in anti-abortion sentiment will threaten access to contraception &mdash; the very thing that prevents unintended pregnancies. But it&rsquo;s not surprising. The Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/opinion/trumps-birth-control-contraception.html\">quietly been</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/opinion/trump-birth-control-backward.html\">chipping away</a> at contraception access for two years now &mdash; all the while pushing anti-abortion policies and with the president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1100211495223218176\">spreading lies</a> about what abortion entails.</p>\n<p>With many medical groups, including the <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-statements/ama-statement-title-x-gag-rule-and-funding-restrictions\">American Medical Association</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.acponline.org/acp-newsroom/top-x-reasons-why-americas-womens-health-providers-oppose-restrictions-to-title-x\">American College of Physicians</a>, opposing the Title X rule change, it&rsquo;s clear that the administration is not on the side of science or public health.

The Trump administration has quietly been chipping away at contraception access for two years now \u2014 all the while pushing anti-abortion policies and with the president spreading lies about what abortion entails.\nWith many medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American College of Physicians, opposing the Title X rule change, it\u2019s clear that the administration is not on the side of science or public health. Women across the nation will pay for it.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We\u2019d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

I just don&rsquo;t want testing. As long as there is no testing, we&rsquo;re happy.&rdquo; Last April, Mr. Kim announced a halt to testing nuclear weapons and missiles, a positive but reversible step.

The alternative, a devastating conflagration that could escalate into nuclear war, should be unthinkable.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the Trump administration&rsquo;s new envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, understands the risks and the opportunities. He is engaged in a serious effort to try both to eradicate North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear and missile programs and address the issues impeding normalization of relations.

Reasonable constraints would include opening up declared North Korean facilities to international inspectors, halting further production of fissile material and ballistic missiles, codifying Mr. Kim&rsquo;s announced testing freezes and nonproliferation pledge and obtaining firm commitments from North Korea to declare the totality of its nuclear and missile infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The model for this approach, anathema as it is to Mr. Trump, is the Iran nuclear negotiations. First, the Obama administration reached an interim agreement with Iran to freeze its nuclear development and roll back aspects of its program in exchange for limited and reversible sanctions relief.

Iran was fully adhering to its obligations when the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew last year.</p>\n<p>To maximize the prospects for success, as in the Iran negotiations, the United States needs China, Russia, Japan and South Korea to join in overseeing implementation of any interim deal. They must also tighten enforcement of existing sanctions and agree to synchronize any deliberate easing of pressure in exchange for concrete, verifiable steps from North Korea. Unfortunately, our international partners are pursuing their separate interests, diminishing American leverage. Though the Trump administration reflexively scorns multilateral efforts, North Korea is yet another case where going it alone won&rsquo;t suffice.</p>\n<p>In Hanoi, Mr. Trump has an opportunity to achieve incremental progress toward denuclearization. Unfortunately, history suggests that Mr. Trump will be content with another colorful photo opportunity and more diplomatic shadow boxing that perpetuates the illusion of success, while running down the clock on a nearly intractable challenge.</p>\n<p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\"><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.

Though the Trump administration reflexively scorns multilateral efforts, North Korea is yet another case where going it alone won\u2019t suffice.\nIn Hanoi, Mr. Trump has an opportunity to achieve incremental progress toward denuclearization. Unfortunately, history suggests that Mr. Trump will be content with another colorful photo opportunity and more diplomatic shadow boxing that perpetuates the illusion of success, while running down the clock on a nearly intractable challenge.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Daley, a member of Chicago&rsquo;s political dynasty of Daleys &mdash; earlier conceded defeat.</p>\n<p>Either <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/us/chicago-election-lightfoot-preckwinkle.html\">Ms. Lightfoot or Ms. Preckwinkle </a>would be the first African-American woman to lead the nation&rsquo;s third largest city, succeeding Mayor Rahm Emanuel as mayor. Only one other woman, Jane Byrne, has been elected mayor, in 1979. If Ms. Lightfoot were to win, she also would be the first openly gay mayor of Chicago.</p>\n<p>Ms. Preckwinkle, 71, a long established politician who has often been urged to run for mayor, had been widely expected to do well in Tuesday&rsquo;s balloting amid a cast of 14 candidates. The success of Ms. Lightfoot, 56, who has never held elective office before, was far more surprising; she was less well known in Chicago&rsquo;s political sphere and had far less money.</p>\n<p><em>[Get to know the candidates: </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/us/lori-lightfoot-chicago-election.html\"><em>Here&rsquo;s a short profile of Ms. Lightfoot.</em></a><em> And </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/us/chicago-election-toni-preckwinkle.html\"><em>one of Ms. Preckwinkle, too.</em></a><em>]</em></p>\n<p>Her win, too, was seen as something of a rebuke to Mr. Emanuel&rsquo;s tenure as mayor and to Chicago&rsquo;s old political history. Ms. Lightfoot had tried to define her campaign as a rejection of machine politics and a refocusing on Chicago&rsquo;s struggling neighborhoods, not just its gleaming downtown.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/us/chicago-mayoral-election.html\"><em>[More on the issues at stake in Chicago&rsquo;s election.]</em></a></p>\n<p>Ms. Lightfoot emerged at a gathering of supporters late Tuesday night, and seemed to take note of people who hadn&rsquo;t expected her success. To applause, she called out: &ldquo;So what do you think of us now?&rdquo; She added: &ldquo;This, my friends, is what change looks like.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The historic nature of the runoff was not lost on Ms. Preckwinkle&rsquo;s supporters, who gathered at a party on another side of town. The crowd cheered when Bridget Gainer, a county commissioner, noted from the stage that Chicago city would, one way or another, have an African-American woman as mayor later this year.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Tonight, I am proud of my city,&rdquo; Ms. Gainer said. &ldquo;Our whole country is going to be watching us and what we&rsquo;re going to be doing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lonnell Saffold, the recording secretary for a local unit of the Service Employees International Union, said having two black women in the runoff shattered &ldquo;a glass ceiling that Chicago probably would have never fathomed.&rdquo; Mr. Saffold said he voted for Ms. Preckwinkle, but that Ms. Lightfoot had been his second choice.</p>\n<p>The city&rsquo;s votes were sprinkled widely across the massive field of 14 candidates who had hoped to replace Mr. Emanuel, who didn&rsquo;t run for a third term. With 92 percent of the votes counted, Ms. Lightfoot had the highest vote tally, with about 17 percent. Ms. Preckwinkle had 16 percent, and Mr. Daley, who was well funded and who many here had expected to easily make the runoff, came in just below 15 percent.</p>\n<p><em>[</em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/us/chicago-mayoral-candidates.html\"><em> This was a look at the top candidates in Tuesday&rsquo;s election, an unusually wide field.</em></a><em>]</em></p>\n<p>For months, Chicago&rsquo;s campaign has looked like a reunion of its best-known political figures &mdash; a former police superintendent, a former public schools chief, a former city clerk.</p>\n<p>Among the names most familiar to voters were Ms. Preckwinkle and Mr. Daley, a brother of this city&rsquo;s longest-serving mayor (Richard M.) and a son of the second-longest-serving mayor (Richard J.). Richard M. Daley, who ran Chicago for 22 years before Mr. Emanuel arrived in 2011, was sometimes known as &ldquo;Mayor for Life,&rdquo; and some Chicagoans thought the Daley name alone would at least advance the latest Daley into a runoff.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday night, Dona Scott, whose husband, Sam, was Mr. Daley&rsquo;s campaign chairman, lingered after Mr. Daley conceded defeat from a stage.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Right now I&rsquo;m digesting what happened,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In my heart of hearts, I believe Bill was the person to lead this city.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sam Scott, the campaign chairman, said that he felt Mr. Daley was hurt by negative ads in the last two weeks from his competitors.</p>\n<p>But there was something more at play. &ldquo;The times have changed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In the last couple of elections we&rsquo;ve seen, younger folks, women, people of color, have taken something of a spotlight. It&rsquo;s more difficult for an older white gentleman to relate to some of the changes that people think that they want.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For weeks, the sheer number of candidates seemed to have left some Chicagoans flummoxed &mdash; unsure, even in the final hours, whom they would vote for. Some political strategists said they wondered if that might discourage some people from voting at all in the election, which is technically nonpartisan, though Democrats reliably win.</p>\n<p>Mr. Emanuel upended Chicago&rsquo;s political landscape when he announced in September that he would not seek a third term. Mr. Emanuel &mdash; who had been sharply criticized over his handling of school closings, crime and police misconduct and had faced political challengers &mdash; said at the time that the mayor&rsquo;s office &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/rahm-emanuel-chicago-mayor.html\">has been the job of a lifetime, but it is not a job for a lifetime</a>.&rdquo; After that, many more candidates stepped forward.</p>\n<p>Whoever becomes the next mayor of this city of 2.7 million people will face an array of complicated, sometimes interconnected, challenges all at once.</p>\n<p>The city&rsquo;s pension system will require an additional $1 billion in revenue by the end of the new mayor&rsquo;s first term. Yet residents say they are weary from years of increases in their property tax bills and fees. Crime and gang violence remains a deep worry for many, even as the city contends with its long history of troubled relations between the police force and residents, especially in the black community.</p>\n<p>And although tourism has boomed downtown, development along the Chicago River has flourished and corporations have flocked to the city in recent years, some neighborhoods on the South and West Sides have struggled with disinvestment, schools closing and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/us/chicago-mayoral-election.html\">people moving away</a>.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Jackie Ropski, a marketing director for an elementary school, said that she saw this election as more important than some, with so many candidates to choose from and at a pivotal moment in Chicago history.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think there is a certain amount of weight on this particular election,&rdquo; Ms. Ropski said, after voting in the Irving Park neighborhood on the Northwest Side. &ldquo;Personally, I think education takes prominence among all the issues, but whoever is mayor has to take a layered approach. How do you solve poverty, crime, neighborhood tensions, education? That&rsquo;s complex.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Alex Ruiz, 33, a student and Uber driver, said that the biggest issue that worried him was Chicago&rsquo;s financial situation and its looming pension obligations. The next mayor, he said, had to get the city&rsquo;s finances in order to spread confidence to Chicagoans about the state of the city.</p>\n<p>Mr. Ruiz grew up only a few miles east of his current neighborhood, Irving Park, but his family had steadily moved west throughout his life as gentrification kept pushing them out.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s trying to stay in this city they were born in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t address the financial issues, we&rsquo;re going to keep driving the middle class out of the city.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At Manny&rsquo;s deli, south of downtown, Natalie Wasso said she was leaning toward voting for Mr. Daley, if she voted at all.</p>\n<p>Ms. Wasso, 32, a phlebotomist who lives on the Southwest Side, said she trusted the Daley family, which led the city for most of her childhood. Her grandmother had always voted for Daleys in past elections.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We never had a problem: That&rsquo;s the name we know in Chicago,&rdquo; Ms. Wasso said. &ldquo;He can relate to us regular people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Jewel Morris, 62, a retired probation officer, said he had voted for Ms. Preckwinkle, though he deemed her the &ldquo;lesser of two evils&rdquo; compared with Mr. Daley.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No Daleys, no Bushes, no dynasties,&rdquo; said Mr. Morris, who lives on the Near West Side. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need any of that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Chicago of 2019 is better than when he was a child, he said. The architecture is unparalleled, the restaurants are world-class and tourists are coming to the city in droves. But the inequality feels like the Chicago of his youth.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking at a tale of two cities,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still the city of neighborhoods and still the city of segregation.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Erin Hooley/Chicago Tribune, via Associated Press\nCHICAGO \u2014 Two African-American women are headed for a runoff in the Chicago mayor\u2019s race, setting up an election that will make history.\nLori Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor and sharp critic of the status quo at City Hall, and Toni Preckwinkle, the county board president and chairwoman of the county\u2019s Democratic Party, will face one another in a runoff election set for April, according to The Associated Press.\nThe third top vote-getter \u2014 William M. Daley, a member of Chicago\u2019s political dynasty of Daleys \u2014 earlier conceded defeat.\nEither Ms. Lightfoot or Ms. Preckwinkle would be the first African-American woman to lead the nation\u2019s third largest city, succeeding Mayor Rahm Emanuel as mayor. Only one other woman, Jane Byrne, has been elected mayor, in 1979. If Ms. Lightfoot were to win, she also would be the first openly gay mayor of Chicago.\nMs. Preckwinkle, 71, a long established politician who has often been urged to run for mayor, had been widely expected to do well in Tuesday\u2019s balloting amid a cast of 14 candidates. The success of Ms. Lightfoot, 56, who has never held elective office before, was far more surprising; she was less well known in Chicago\u2019s political sphere and had far less money.\n[Get to know the candidates: Here\u2019s a short profile of Ms. Lightfoot. And one of Ms. Preckwinkle, too.]\nHer win, too, was seen as something of a rebuke to Mr. Emanuel\u2019s tenure as mayor and to Chicago\u2019s old political history. Ms. Lightfoot had tried to define her campaign as a rejection of machine politics and a refocusing on Chicago\u2019s struggling neighborhoods, not just its gleaming downtown.\n[More on the issues at stake in Chicago\u2019s election.]\nMs. Lightfoot emerged at a gathering of supporters late Tuesday night, and seemed to take note of people who hadn\u2019t expected her success. To applause, she called out: \u201cSo what do you think of us now?\u201d She added: \u201cThis, my friends, is what change looks like.\u201d\nThe historic nature of the runoff was not lost on Ms. Preckwinkle\u2019s supporters, who gathered at a party on another side of town. The crowd cheered when Bridget Gainer, a county commissioner, noted from the stage that Chicago city would, one way or another, have an African-American woman as mayor later this year.\n\u201cTonight, I am proud of my city,\u201d Ms. Gainer said. \u201cOur whole country is going to be watching us and what we\u2019re going to be doing.\u201d\nLonnell Saffold, the recording secretary for a local unit of the Service Employees International Union, said having two black women in the runoff shattered \u201ca glass ceiling that Chicago probably would have never fathomed.\u201d Mr. Saffold said he voted for Ms. Preckwinkle, but that Ms. Lightfoot had been his second choice.\nThe city\u2019s votes were sprinkled widely across the massive field of 14 candidates who had hoped to replace Mr. Emanuel, who didn\u2019t run for a third term. With 92 percent of the votes counted, Ms. Lightfoot had the highest vote tally, with about 17 percent. Ms. Preckwinkle had 16 percent, and Mr. Daley, who was well funded and who many here had expected to easily make the runoff, came in just below 15 percent.\n[ This was a look at the top candidates in Tuesday\u2019s election, an unusually wide field.]\nFor months, Chicago\u2019s campaign has looked like a reunion of its best-known political figures \u2014 a former police superintendent, a former public schools chief, a former city clerk.\nAmong the names most familiar to voters were Ms. Preckwinkle and Mr. Daley, a brother of this city\u2019s longest-serving mayor (Richard M.) and a son of the second-longest-serving mayor (Richard J.). Richard M. Daley, who ran Chicago for 22 years before Mr. Emanuel arrived in 2011, was sometimes known as \u201cMayor for Life,\u201d and some Chicagoans thought the Daley name alone would at least advance the latest Daley into a runoff.\nOn Tuesday night, Dona Scott, whose husband, Sam, was Mr. Daley\u2019s campaign chairman, lingered after Mr. Daley conceded defeat from a stage.\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m digesting what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my heart of hearts, I believe Bill was the person to lead this city.\u201d\nSam Scott, the campaign chairman, said that he felt Mr. Daley was hurt by negative ads in the last two weeks from his competitors.\nBut there was something more at play. \u201cThe times have changed,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last couple of elections we\u2019ve seen, younger folks, women, people of color, have taken something of a spotlight. It\u2019s more difficult for an older white gentleman to relate to some of the changes that people think that they want.\u201d\nFor weeks, the sheer number of candidates seemed to have left some Chicagoans flummoxed \u2014 unsure, even in the final hours, whom they would vote for. Some political strategists said they wondered if that might discourage some people from voting at all in the election, which is technically nonpartisan, though Democrats reliably win.\nMr. Emanuel upended Chicago\u2019s political landscape when he announced in September that he would not seek a third term. Mr. Emanuel \u2014 who had been sharply criticized over his handling of school closings, crime and police misconduct and had faced political challengers \u2014 said at the time that the mayor\u2019s office \u201chas been the job of a lifetime, but it is not a job for a lifetime.\u201d After that, many more candidates stepped forward.\nWhoever becomes the next mayor of this city of 2.7 million people will face an array of complicated, sometimes interconnected, challenges all at once.\nThe city\u2019s pension system will require an additional $1 billion in revenue by the end of the new mayor\u2019s first term. Yet residents say they are weary from years of increases in their property tax bills and fees. Crime and gang violence remains a deep worry for many, even as the city contends with its long history of troubled relations between the police force and residents, especially in the black community.\nAnd although tourism has boomed downtown, development along the Chicago River has flourished and corporations have flocked to the city in recent years, some neighborhoods on the South and West Sides have struggled with disinvestment, schools closing and people moving away.\nOn Tuesday, Jackie Ropski, a marketing director for an elementary school, said that she saw this election as more important than some, with so many candidates to choose from and at a pivotal moment in Chicago history.\n\u201cI think there is a certain amount of weight on this particular election,\u201d Ms. Ropski said, after voting in the Irving Park neighborhood on the Northwest Side. \u201cPersonally, I think education takes prominence among all the issues, but whoever is mayor has to take a layered approach. How do you solve poverty, crime, neighborhood tensions, education? That\u2019s complex.\u201d\nAlex Ruiz, 33, a student and Uber driver, said that the biggest issue that worried him was Chicago\u2019s financial situation and its looming pension obligations. The next mayor, he said, had to get the city\u2019s finances in order to spread confidence to Chicagoans about the state of the city.\nMr. Ruiz grew up only a few miles east of his current neighborhood, Irving Park, but his family had steadily moved west throughout his life as gentrification kept pushing them out.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to stay in this city they were born in,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t address the financial issues, we\u2019re going to keep driving the middle class out of the city.\u201d\nAt Manny\u2019s deli, south of downtown, Natalie Wasso said she was leaning toward voting for Mr. Daley, if she voted at all.\nMs. Wasso, 32, a phlebotomist who lives on the Southwest Side, said she trusted the Daley family, which led the city for most of her childhood. Her grandmother had always voted for Daleys in past elections.\n\u201cWe never had a problem: That\u2019s the name we know in Chicago,\u201d Ms. Wasso said. \u201cHe can relate to us regular people.\u201d\nBut Jewel Morris, 62, a retired probation officer, said he had voted for Ms. Preckwinkle, though he deemed her the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d compared with Mr. Daley.\n\u201cNo Daleys, no Bushes, no dynasties,\u201d said Mr. Morris, who lives on the Near West Side. \u201cWe don\u2019t need any of that.\u201d\nThe Chicago of 2019 is better than when he was a child, he said. The architecture is unparalleled, the restaurants are world-class and tourists are coming to the city in droves. But the inequality feels like the Chicago of his youth.\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at a tale of two cities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still the city of neighborhoods and still the city of segregation.\u201d",

Some smaller and newer apartment buildings would be exempt.</p>\n<p>The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 35 to 25, largely along party lines. It had already been approved by the State Senate, and Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, plans to sign the bill, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The measure&rsquo;s passage comes as states and cities across the country have struggled to address a growing housing affordability crisis. Rents have risen while wages have stagnated, and the supply of affordable housing has fallen short of need.</p>\n<p>In Oregon, median rent has increased by more than 14 percent statewide in recent years. In Portland, the epicenter of the crisis, median rents have risen by 30 percent since 2011, adjusted for inflation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is no single solution &mdash; not one entity, or one person &mdash; that can solve Oregon&rsquo;s housing crisis,&rdquo; Ms. Brown said in a statement Tuesday. &ldquo;This new legislation is one of many actions Oregon needs to take to address our housing crisis. While it will provide some immediate relief, we need to focus on building supply in order to address Oregon&rsquo;s housing challenges for the long term.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lisa Morawski, a spokeswoman for Ms. Brown, said Tuesday that a legal team would review the bill before the governor could sign it into law, at which point it would go into effect immediately. Ms. Morawski did not immediately have a timeline for when that would happen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbhub.io/dotorg/sites/2/2018/04/American-Mayors-Survey.pdf\">Three-quarters of the country&rsquo;s mayors</a> say that a lack of affordable housing is a significant concern, and they are reacting: Boston <a href=\"https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2018/12/04/can-boston-tax-its-way-to-more-affordable-housing\">is proposing steep taxes</a> on developers.

                "text": "Amanda Lucier for The New York Times\nOregon is poised to become the first state in the nation to impose statewide limits on how much landlords can raise rents after state lawmakers passed a sweeping measure on Tuesday.\nThe legislation would generally limit rent increases to 7 percent annually plus the change in the Consumer Price Index, a measure of inflation. Some smaller and newer apartment buildings would be exempt.\nThe Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 35 to 25, largely along party lines. It had already been approved by the State Senate, and Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, plans to sign the bill, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.\nThe measure\u2019s passage comes as states and cities across the country have struggled to address a growing housing affordability crisis. Rents have risen while wages have stagnated, and the supply of affordable housing has fallen short of need.\nIn Oregon, median rent has increased by more than 14 percent statewide in recent years. In Portland, the epicenter of the crisis, median rents have risen by 30 percent since 2011, adjusted for inflation.\n\u201cThere is no single solution \u2014 not one entity, or one person \u2014 that can solve Oregon\u2019s housing crisis,\u201d Ms. Brown said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThis new legislation is one of many actions Oregon needs to take to address our housing crisis. While it will provide some immediate relief, we need to focus on building supply in order to address Oregon\u2019s housing challenges for the long term.\u201d\nLisa Morawski, a spokeswoman for Ms. Brown, said Tuesday that a legal team would review the bill before the governor could sign it into law, at which point it would go into effect immediately. Ms. Morawski did not immediately have a timeline for when that would happen.\nThree-quarters of the country\u2019s mayors say that a lack of affordable housing is a significant concern, and they are reacting: Boston is proposing steep taxes on developers. Denver is studying proposals to allow more carriage houses \u2014 detached separate units on the same lot as a house \u2014 which are generally cheaper to build than homes.\nRent control has been a particularly divisive topic. While Oregon\u2019s would be the first statewide rent control measure, many states prohibit their cities from capping rent increases.\nCities like New York, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco have rent control policies.\nBut economists tend to agree that rent control makes housing problems worse in the long run.\nSome say that by limiting the amount of rent landlords can collect, they will take the properties off the market, limiting the housing supply at a time when there already is a crunch.\n\u201cWhile the intent of rent control laws is to assist lower-income populations, history has shown that rent control exacerbates shortages, makes it harder for apartment owners to make upgrades and disproportionally benefits higher-income households,\u201d Doug Bibby, president of the National Multifamily Housing Council, which represents the apartment industry, said in a statement Tuesday about the Oregon bill.\nApartment buildings with fewer than five units are exempt from the bill. So are housing complexes that are less than 15 years old. The bill also sharply reduces the circumstances in which tenants can be evicted.",

But as he backs off his threat to impose higher tariffs, the president&rsquo;s relationship with his own trade negotiator is now showing signs of strain.</p>\n<p>The situation has left Mr. Trump&rsquo;s trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, who is both an ardent supporter of the president and a longtime China critic, in an uncomfortable bind. While broad tariffs on Chinese imports brought Beijing to the negotiating table, Mr. Trump has grown impatient with the talks, and a consensus is growing in Washington that Mr. Trump will ultimately accept a weak deal.</p>\n<p>And despite the lack of a transformative arrangement he once promised, the president has begun dangling the idea of a &ldquo;signing summit&rdquo; with President Xi Jinping of China at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump&rsquo;s Florida resort. As a result, the president is undermining Mr. Lighthizer as he tries to pressure China to make big concessions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Trump is certainly doing his negotiating team no favors by undercutting them in public,&rdquo; said Eswar Prasad, a trade expert and the former head of the China division of the International Monetary Fund. The president&rsquo;s actions, he said, &ldquo;weakens rather than fortifies Lighthizer&rsquo;s leverage.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Mr. Lighthizer will testify before House lawmakers, where he will have to credibly defend a pact that is shaping up to be less ambitious than he might have hoped.</p>\n<p>Mr. Lighthizer has publicly expressed solidarity with the president&rsquo;s goals, and those who know him say he remains loyal to Mr. Trump. In private, however, he has been frustrated by the president&rsquo;s superficial understanding of the trading relationship with China and his tendency to jump unpredictably into the fray, friends and contacts say.</p>\n<p>American and Chinese negotiators have wrestled over trade terms in rounds of talks over the past year, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/business/economy/china-usa-trade.html\">in Washington last week</a>. Chinese negotiators have largely repackaged old promises about opening their markets to foreign companies and offered large purchases of American products that are designed to impress a president who is focused on reducing the bilateral trade deficit.</p>\n<p>The Chinese have so far declined to make the concrete commitments to reform their economy that the administration has demanded, including ending China&rsquo;s practice of subsidizing companies, engaging in cybertheft and forcing American companies to hand over intellectual property to Chinese partners in order to do business there.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump continues to insist that any deal with China will end &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; trade practices, including what he has said is theft of American technology and intellectual property. And negotiators are trying to insert an enforcement mechanism into any deal that would require China to return to the bargaining table if it fails to make these structural changes, a person familiar with the talks said.</p>\n<p>But the hardened position that prompted Mr. Trump&rsquo;s unprecedented imposition of sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods appears to be weakening, giving Beijing more room to maneuver and undermining Mr. Lighthizer&rsquo;s goal.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, citing &ldquo;substantial progress&rdquo; in trade talks, Mr. Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/us/politics/us-china-trade-truce.html\">backed off his March 1 deadline</a> to impose higher tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. That date had been described by Mr. Lighthizer in December as a &ldquo;hard deadline&rdquo; and was viewed as critical to getting Beijing to agree to significant changes since its economy, already hurting from tariffs, would suffer more from higher levies.</p>\n<p>Last week, Mr. Trump contradicted Mr. Lighthizer by lumping the fate of Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant facing criminal charges, in with the trade talks. Mr. Lighthizer had insisted that Huawei was &ldquo;entirely a criminal justice matter&rdquo; and that it had &ldquo;nothing to do with anything I&rsquo;m working on.&rdquo; But on Friday, when asked whether criminal charges against Huawei could be dropped as part of an agreement, Mr. Trump said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be talking to the U.S. attorneys. We&rsquo;ll be talking to the attorney general. We&rsquo;ll be making that decision.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;His intervention has now ratcheted up the pressure on both sets of negotiators to find a path to an agreement in the coming weeks, even if the result should be a narrow and short-lived agreement,&rdquo; Mr. Prasad said.</p>\n<p>The differences between the two men mounted on Friday, as they shared <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/business/economy/china-usa-trade.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fana-swanson&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=3&pgtype=collection\">a remarkable exchange</a> in front of the press and the Chinese delegation over whether to call the current trade agreement a memorandum of understanding, or M.O.U., as Mr. Lighthizer had been doing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like M.O.U.s because they don&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; Mr. Trump told Mr. Lighthizer. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re better off just going into a document. I was never a fan of an M.O.U.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Lighthizer interjected to explain that, in trade negotiations, an M.O.U. is a typical term for a detailed contract between two parties.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just called a memorandum of understanding,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a legal term.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump, seemingly unhappy with being contradicted, cut back in.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;By the way, I disagree,&rdquo; the president said. &ldquo;I think that a memorandum of understanding is not a contract to the extent that we want.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To me, the final contract is really the thing, Bob &mdash; and I think you mean that, too &mdash; is really the thing that means something,&rdquo; the president added.</p>\n<p>Mr. Lighthizer quickly reversed course. &ldquo;From now on, we&rsquo;re not using the word memorandum of understanding anymore,&rdquo; he told Mr. Trump and his Chinese counterparts. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the same document. It&rsquo;s going to be called a trade agreement. We&rsquo;re never going to use M.O.U. again.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I like that much better,&rdquo; Mr. Trump said.</p>\n<p>By Sunday night, the president seemed eager to heal any rift. Speaking from a dinner at the White House, the president commended Mr. Lighthizer for working around the clock to secure a deal with China.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When I was able to be lucky enough to win the presidency, I called Bob Lighthizer, because for years people have known he&rsquo;s the greatest trader that we have on this type of trade &mdash; we have many different types of trade &mdash; and I really understand now why,&rdquo; the president said.</p>\n<p>With the Chinese now making only vague concessions on structural reforms, Mr. Lighthizer would prefer to stay tough and let the bite of American tariffs persuade them to make bigger promises. While he has shared with Mr. Trump the view that the Chinese are not ready to make significant concessions, the president has continued to press for a deal.</p>\n<p>Jeff Emerson, a spokesman for the United States trade representative, denied that Mr. Lighthizer had ever been frustrated with the president, saying that he and Mr. Trump were in complete agreement on the negotiating strategy with China.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;President Trump has never insisted that Ambassador Lighthizer make a deal with China and has instead told Ambassador Lighthizer he is interested only in making a &lsquo;great deal&rsquo; with China that addresses structural issues,&rdquo; Mr. Emerson added. &ldquo;Anyone claiming otherwise either does not know what they are talking about or is deliberately pushing falsehoods.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Lighthizer is well respected in Washington, with decades of experience in private legal practice and government, including leading trade talks with Japan in the 1980s. In trying to pin down the Chinese on making ambitious reforms to their economy, he has an unenviable task.</p>\n<p>Many business groups and China watchers credit the Trump administration with forcing China to finally come to the table and address longstanding concerns, including its treatment of American companies. And they say the administration is poised to secure greater concessions than previous administrations have.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Bob Lighthizer has made it a priority to get this China deal right,&rdquo; said Myron Brilliant, an executive vice president and the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. &ldquo;He understands that this is the moment in time in which there&rsquo;s an opportunity to make a real change in the trajectory of the U.S.-China relationship, and he&rsquo;s focused on the bottom line: what he can get from the Chinese that will improve the U.S.-China economic relationship.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Lighthizer, who will testify before the House Ways and Means Committee, is expected to face tough questions from lawmakers about the state of the negotiations and whether he feels comfortable staking his legacy on the evolving China deal. While many Republicans are eager for the trade war to end, they are warning the administration not to settle for a weak deal. Democrats are already trying to outflank Mr. Trump on China and are gearing up to call any agreement that does not include structural changes a failure.</p>\n<p>Mr. Lighthizer and other members of his office have held discussions with politicians and trade advisers of both parties, urging them to maintain their public pressure to get a substantial deal.</p>\n<p>In a statement Monday, Daniel DiMicco, Mr. Trump&rsquo;s trade adviser during the campaign and the chairman of trade group the Coalition for a Prosperous America, urged the president to &ldquo;continue his strategy of strength and leverage in the U.S. trade and geopolitical relationship with China&rdquo; and to &ldquo;resist short-term pressure from Wall Street.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, urged Mr. Trump not to cave, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1099093819444944898\">saying in a tweet</a>, &ldquo;No matter how many tons of soybeans they buy if #China gets to keep cheating &amp; stealing trade secrets it won&rsquo;t be a good deal for America, our workers or our national security.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Lighthizer, a former steel industry lawyer who grew up watching factories disappear from his native Ohio, took the trade representative job in large part to shift power away from China and toward the United States. Mr. Lighthizer has long viewed China as an economic enemy that has engaged in unfair trade practices, destroying American industries in the process.</p>\n<p>The potential for Mr. Trump to reach a compromise deal with China has prompted speculation in Washington that Mr. Lighthizer, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/16/us/politics/all-the-major-firings-and-resignations-in-trump-administration.html\">like so many other administration officials</a>, might resign. But while Mr. Lighthizer views changing the China dynamic as critical, his confidantes say he is unlikely to leave given his unprecedented opportunity to improve America&rsquo;s terms of trade with Canada, Mexico and the European Union, as well as at the World Trade Organization.</p>\n<p>Mr. Emerson said rumors of Mr. Lighthizer&rsquo;s resignation were &ldquo;a total falsehood.&quot;</p>\n<p>Mr. Lighthizer &ldquo;believes President Trump is the greatest trade president in our history and is honored to help him,&rdquo; Mr. Emerson said.</p>",

                "text": "Mark Schiefelbein/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has signaled that he is moving toward peace with China in a trade standoff that has rattled markets and businesses globally. But as he backs off his threat to impose higher tariffs, the president\u2019s relationship with his own trade negotiator is now showing signs of strain.\nThe situation has left Mr. Trump\u2019s trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, who is both an ardent supporter of the president and a longtime China critic, in an uncomfortable bind. While broad tariffs on Chinese imports brought Beijing to the negotiating table, Mr. Trump has grown impatient with the talks, and a consensus is growing in Washington that Mr. Trump will ultimately accept a weak deal.\nAnd despite the lack of a transformative arrangement he once promised, the president has begun dangling the idea of a \u201csigning summit\u201d with President Xi Jinping of China at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida resort. As a result, the president is undermining Mr. Lighthizer as he tries to pressure China to make big concessions.\n\u201cTrump is certainly doing his negotiating team no favors by undercutting them in public,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a trade expert and the former head of the China division of the International Monetary Fund. The president\u2019s actions, he said, \u201cweakens rather than fortifies Lighthizer\u2019s leverage.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Lighthizer will testify before House lawmakers, where he will have to credibly defend a pact that is shaping up to be less ambitious than he might have hoped.\nMr. Lighthizer has publicly expressed solidarity with the president\u2019s goals, and those who know him say he remains loyal to Mr. Trump. In private, however, he has been frustrated by the president\u2019s superficial understanding of the trading relationship with China and his tendency to jump unpredictably into the fray, friends and contacts say.\nAmerican and Chinese negotiators have wrestled over trade terms in rounds of talks over the past year, including in Washington last week. Chinese negotiators have largely repackaged old promises about opening their markets to foreign companies and offered large purchases of American products that are designed to impress a president who is focused on reducing the bilateral trade deficit.\nThe Chinese have so far declined to make the concrete commitments to reform their economy that the administration has demanded, including ending China\u2019s practice of subsidizing companies, engaging in cybertheft and forcing American companies to hand over intellectual property to Chinese partners in order to do business there.\nMr. Trump continues to insist that any deal with China will end \u201cunfair\u201d trade practices, including what he has said is theft of American technology and intellectual property. And negotiators are trying to insert an enforcement mechanism into any deal that would require China to return to the bargaining table if it fails to make these structural changes, a person familiar with the talks said.\nBut the hardened position that prompted Mr. Trump\u2019s unprecedented imposition of sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods appears to be weakening, giving Beijing more room to maneuver and undermining Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s goal.\nOn Sunday, citing \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in trade talks, Mr. Trump backed off his March 1 deadline to impose higher tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. That date had been described by Mr. Lighthizer in December as a \u201chard deadline\u201d and was viewed as critical to getting Beijing to agree to significant changes since its economy, already hurting from tariffs, would suffer more from higher levies.\nLast week, Mr. Trump contradicted Mr. Lighthizer by lumping the fate of Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant facing criminal charges, in with the trade talks. Mr. Lighthizer had insisted that Huawei was \u201centirely a criminal justice matter\u201d and that it had \u201cnothing to do with anything I\u2019m working on.\u201d But on Friday, when asked whether criminal charges against Huawei could be dropped as part of an agreement, Mr. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be talking to the U.S. attorneys. We\u2019ll be talking to the attorney general. We\u2019ll be making that decision.\u201d\n\u201cHis intervention has now ratcheted up the pressure on both sets of negotiators to find a path to an agreement in the coming weeks, even if the result should be a narrow and short-lived agreement,\u201d Mr. Prasad said.\nThe differences between the two men mounted on Friday, as they shared a remarkable exchange in front of the press and the Chinese delegation over whether to call the current trade agreement a memorandum of understanding, or M.O.U., as Mr. Lighthizer had been doing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like M.O.U.s because they don\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Lighthizer. \u201cI think you\u2019re better off just going into a document. I was never a fan of an M.O.U.\u201d\nMr. Lighthizer interjected to explain that, in trade negotiations, an M.O.U. is a typical term for a detailed contract between two parties.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just called a memorandum of understanding,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a legal term.\u201d\nMr. Trump, seemingly unhappy with being contradicted, cut back in.\n\u201cBy the way, I disagree,\u201d the president said. \u201cI think that a memorandum of understanding is not a contract to the extent that we want.\u201d\n\u201cTo me, the final contract is really the thing, Bob \u2014 and I think you mean that, too \u2014 is really the thing that means something,\u201d the president added.\nMr. Lighthizer quickly reversed course. \u201cFrom now on, we\u2019re not using the word memorandum of understanding anymore,\u201d he told Mr. Trump and his Chinese counterparts. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the same document. It\u2019s going to be called a trade agreement. We\u2019re never going to use M.O.U. again.\u201d\n\u201cI like that much better,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nBy Sunday night, the president seemed eager to heal any rift. Speaking from a dinner at the White House, the president commended Mr. Lighthizer for working around the clock to secure a deal with China.\n\u201cWhen I was able to be lucky enough to win the presidency, I called Bob Lighthizer, because for years people have known he\u2019s the greatest trader that we have on this type of trade \u2014 we have many different types of trade \u2014 and I really understand now why,\u201d the president said.\nWith the Chinese now making only vague concessions on structural reforms, Mr. Lighthizer would prefer to stay tough and let the bite of American tariffs persuade them to make bigger promises. While he has shared with Mr. Trump the view that the Chinese are not ready to make significant concessions, the president has continued to press for a deal.\nJeff Emerson, a spokesman for the United States trade representative, denied that Mr. Lighthizer had ever been frustrated with the president, saying that he and Mr. Trump were in complete agreement on the negotiating strategy with China.\n\u201cPresident Trump has never insisted that Ambassador Lighthizer make a deal with China and has instead told Ambassador Lighthizer he is interested only in making a \u2018great deal\u2019 with China that addresses structural issues,\u201d Mr. Emerson added. \u201cAnyone claiming otherwise either does not know what they are talking about or is deliberately pushing falsehoods.\u201d\nMr. Lighthizer is well respected in Washington, with decades of experience in private legal practice and government, including leading trade talks with Japan in the 1980s. In trying to pin down the Chinese on making ambitious reforms to their economy, he has an unenviable task.\nMany business groups and China watchers credit the Trump administration with forcing China to finally come to the table and address longstanding concerns, including its treatment of American companies. And they say the administration is poised to secure greater concessions than previous administrations have.\n\u201cBob Lighthizer has made it a priority to get this China deal right,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, an executive vice president and the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cHe understands that this is the moment in time in which there\u2019s an opportunity to make a real change in the trajectory of the U.S.-China relationship, and he\u2019s focused on the bottom line: what he can get from the Chinese that will improve the U.S.-China economic relationship.\u201d\nMr. Lighthizer, who will testify before the House Ways and Means Committee, is expected to face tough questions from lawmakers about the state of the negotiations and whether he feels comfortable staking his legacy on the evolving China deal. While many Republicans are eager for the trade war to end, they are warning the administration not to settle for a weak deal. Democrats are already trying to outflank Mr. Trump on China and are gearing up to call any agreement that does not include structural changes a failure.\nMr. Lighthizer and other members of his office have held discussions with politicians and trade advisers of both parties, urging them to maintain their public pressure to get a substantial deal.\nIn a statement Monday, Daniel DiMicco, Mr. Trump\u2019s trade adviser during the campaign and the chairman of trade group the Coalition for a Prosperous America, urged the president to \u201ccontinue his strategy of strength and leverage in the U.S. trade and geopolitical relationship with China\u201d and to \u201cresist short-term pressure from Wall Street.\u201d\nSenator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, urged Mr. Trump not to cave, saying in a tweet, \u201cNo matter how many tons of soybeans they buy if #China gets to keep cheating & stealing trade secrets it won\u2019t be a good deal for America, our workers or our national security.\u201d\nMr. Lighthizer, a former steel industry lawyer who grew up watching factories disappear from his native Ohio, took the trade representative job in large part to shift power away from China and toward the United States. Mr. Lighthizer has long viewed China as an economic enemy that has engaged in unfair trade practices, destroying American industries in the process.\nThe potential for Mr. Trump to reach a compromise deal with China has prompted speculation in Washington that Mr. Lighthizer, like so many other administration officials, might resign. But while Mr. Lighthizer views changing the China dynamic as critical, his confidantes say he is unlikely to leave given his unprecedented opportunity to improve America\u2019s terms of trade with Canada, Mexico and the European Union, as well as at the World Trade Organization.\nMr. Emerson said rumors of Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s resignation were \u201ca total falsehood.\"\nMr. Lighthizer \u201cbelieves President Trump is the greatest trade president in our history and is honored to help him,\u201d Mr. Emerson said.",

LOUIS &mdash; The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/us/methodist-split-gay-marriage.html\">United Methodist Church</a> on Tuesday voted to strengthen its ban on gay and lesbian clergy and same-sex marriages, a decision that could split the nation&rsquo;s second-largest Protestant church.</p>\n<p>After three days of intense debate at a conference in St. Louis, the vote by church officials and lay members from around the world doubled down on current church policy, which states that &ldquo;the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.&rdquo; The vote served as a rejection of a push by progressive members and leaders to open the church to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.</p>\n<p>Now, a divide of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/us/methodist-split-gay-marriage.html\">United Methodist Church</a>, which has 12 million members worldwide, appears imminent. Some pastors and bishops in the United States are already talking about leaving the denomination and possibly creating a new alliance for gay-friendly churches.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is time for another movement,&rdquo; the Rev. Mike Slaughter, pastor emeritus of Ginghamsburg Church in Ohio, said in a phone interview from the floor of the conference. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even know what that is yet, but it is something new.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The decision, passed in a 53 percent to 47 percent vote, is the latest eruption in the fight over the future of American Christianity and over whose views of human sexuality are enshrined as Christian.</p>\n<p>Conservatives have left the Episcopal Church over gay rights, Presbyterians have split, and many young evangelicals are leaving their churches over the lack of inclusion of L.G.B.T. people.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the nation is becoming increasingly less Christian, and the share of religiously unaffiliated Americans is growing. As mainline denominations that embrace gay rights continue to decline in membership, conservative Christian institutions are growing in power and financial resources.</p>\n<p>The seven million members of the United Methodist Church in the United States often do not fit within easy political categories. Second only to the Southern Baptist Convention in size, the church includes high-profile figures with a range of political beliefs, from Hillary Clinton to Jeff Sessions, the Republican former attorney general.</p>\n<p>Just <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/religious-denomination/united-methodist-church/\">over</a> <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/religious-denomination/united-methodist-church/\">half of Methodists</a> say they are Republican, compared with 35 percent who say they are Democrats. The majority of adherents believe abortion should be legal, and more than half are in favor of stricter regulations to protect the environment.</p>\n<p>But the issue of gay rights has proved uniquely divisive in the church, and Tuesday&rsquo;s vote reflected the growing clout of Methodists from outside the United States. The tightening of enforcement of church law was backed by a coalition of members from African nations, the Philippines and European and American evangelicals.</p>\n<p>While membership has steadily declined in the United States over the past 25 years &mdash; a trend that is true for most mainline Protestant denominations &mdash; it has been growing in Africa. About 30 percent of the church&rsquo;s members are now from African nations, which typically have conservative Christian views; in many of them, homosexuality is a crime.</p>\n<p>But in the United States, the vote poses a significant risk for a denomination that struggles to attract young people. United Methodists have one of the oldest religious populations in the country, with a <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/11/which-u-s-religious-groups-are-oldest-and-youngest/\">median age</a> of 57.</p>\n<p>Some leaders of Methodist seminaries like Duke Divinity School or Candler School of Theology at Emory worry that this week&rsquo;s move will dissuade young Americans, who increasingly support gay rights, from going into ministry with the church.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This feels like one generation locking down the church for the next,&rdquo; said William H. Willimon, a retired bishop of the United Methodist Church and a professor at Duke Divinity School. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a death sentence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In recent years, progressive American members, including gays and lesbians, have been hopeful about greater inclusion. <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/religious-denomination/united-methodist-church/\">Six in 10</a> United Methodists in the United States believe homosexuality should be accepted.</p>\n<p>Some congregations have celebrated same-sex weddings and had gay, lesbian and transgender pastors, at times receiving church approval to do so even though it technically violated church policy. Punishment of those who violated the rules has been uneven, and church trials for the few who were sanctioned have been unpopular.</p>\n<p><em>[</em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/us/united-methodist-church-gay-same-sex-marriage.html\"><em>Read more here about the competing plans for the future of the United Methodist Church.</em></a><em>]</em></p>\n<p>The new rules would tighten enforcement and increase punishment for violations. For instance, clergy who officiate at same-sex weddings could receive a minimum one-year, unpaid suspension, and a second offense could result in removal from the clergy. Some items in the plan need to be reviewed by the Methodists&rsquo; judicial council.</p>\n<p>The Rev. Susan Henry-Crowe, who leads one of the church&rsquo;s prominent administrative agencies, called the plan &ldquo;punitive&rdquo; in a statement, and said that the conference had brought &ldquo;unbearable pain&rdquo; to the denomination. &ldquo;The wound may one day be healed by the grace of God,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but the scar left behind will be visible forever.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For many, the church&rsquo;s slogan, &ldquo;Open Hearts. Open Minds. Open Doors,&rdquo; now feels shattered.</p>\n<p>Soon after the vote, protests erupted in the center of the arena where the conference had been held &mdash; a former football stadium known as The Dome.

                "text": "Sid Hastings/Associated Press\nST. LOUIS \u2014 The United Methodist Church on Tuesday voted to strengthen its ban on gay and lesbian clergy and same-sex marriages, a decision that could split the nation\u2019s second-largest Protestant church.\nAfter three days of intense debate at a conference in St. Louis, the vote by church officials and lay members from around the world doubled down on current church policy, which states that \u201cthe practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.\u201d The vote served as a rejection of a push by progressive members and leaders to open the church to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\nNow, a divide of the United Methodist Church, which has 12 million members worldwide, appears imminent. Some pastors and bishops in the United States are already talking about leaving the denomination and possibly creating a new alliance for gay-friendly churches.\n\u201cIt is time for another movement,\u201d the Rev. Mike Slaughter, pastor emeritus of Ginghamsburg Church in Ohio, said in a phone interview from the floor of the conference. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what that is yet, but it is something new.\u201d\nThe decision, passed in a 53 percent to 47 percent vote, is the latest eruption in the fight over the future of American Christianity and over whose views of human sexuality are enshrined as Christian.\nConservatives have left the Episcopal Church over gay rights, Presbyterians have split, and many young evangelicals are leaving their churches over the lack of inclusion of L.G.B.T. people.\nMeanwhile, the nation is becoming increasingly less Christian, and the share of religiously unaffiliated Americans is growing. As mainline denominations that embrace gay rights continue to decline in membership, conservative Christian institutions are growing in power and financial resources.\nThe seven million members of the United Methodist Church in the United States often do not fit within easy political categories. Second only to the Southern Baptist Convention in size, the church includes high-profile figures with a range of political beliefs, from Hillary Clinton to Jeff Sessions, the Republican former attorney general.\nJust over half of Methodists say they are Republican, compared with 35 percent who say they are Democrats. The majority of adherents believe abortion should be legal, and more than half are in favor of stricter regulations to protect the environment.\nBut the issue of gay rights has proved uniquely divisive in the church, and Tuesday\u2019s vote reflected the growing clout of Methodists from outside the United States. The tightening of enforcement of church law was backed by a coalition of members from African nations, the Philippines and European and American evangelicals.\nWhile membership has steadily declined in the United States over the past 25 years \u2014 a trend that is true for most mainline Protestant denominations \u2014 it has been growing in Africa. About 30 percent of the church\u2019s members are now from African nations, which typically have conservative Christian views; in many of them, homosexuality is a crime.\nBut in the United States, the vote poses a significant risk for a denomination that struggles to attract young people. United Methodists have one of the oldest religious populations in the country, with a median age of 57.\nSome leaders of Methodist seminaries like Duke Divinity School or Candler School of Theology at Emory worry that this week\u2019s move will dissuade young Americans, who increasingly support gay rights, from going into ministry with the church.\n\u201cThis feels like one generation locking down the church for the next,\u201d said William H. Willimon, a retired bishop of the United Methodist Church and a professor at Duke Divinity School. \u201cThat\u2019s a death sentence.\u201d\nIn recent years, progressive American members, including gays and lesbians, have been hopeful about greater inclusion. Six in 10 United Methodists in the United States believe homosexuality should be accepted.\nSome congregations have celebrated same-sex weddings and had gay, lesbian and transgender pastors, at times receiving church approval to do so even though it technically violated church policy. Punishment of those who violated the rules has been uneven, and church trials for the few who were sanctioned have been unpopular.\n[Read more here about the competing plans for the future of the United Methodist Church.]\nThe new rules would tighten enforcement and increase punishment for violations. For instance, clergy who officiate at same-sex weddings could receive a minimum one-year, unpaid suspension, and a second offense could result in removal from the clergy. Some items in the plan need to be reviewed by the Methodists\u2019 judicial council.\nThe Rev. Susan Henry-Crowe, who leads one of the church\u2019s prominent administrative agencies, called the plan \u201cpunitive\u201d in a statement, and said that the conference had brought \u201cunbearable pain\u201d to the denomination. \u201cThe wound may one day be healed by the grace of God,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the scar left behind will be visible forever.\u201d\nFor many, the church\u2019s slogan, \u201cOpen Hearts. Open Minds. Open Doors,\u201d now feels shattered.\nSoon after the vote, protests erupted in the center of the arena where the conference had been held \u2014 a former football stadium known as The Dome. Some delegates began singing church songs and chanting, \u201cWe\u2019re queer,\u201d and \u201cThis is our church!\u201d\n\u201cMy kids\u2019 friends are not going to come into the church unless I can tell them about the love part of our church, not just the judgment part,\u201d said David Livingston, 45, a pastor from Kansas.\nAt the same time, conservatives celebrated their narrow victory. Tom Lambrecht, 64, an ordained elder from Texas, said the denomination must uphold its traditions if it is to survive. If progressives are ultimately unable to agree with that approach, he said it would be best for them to leave the denomination so that Methodists could devote more time on ministry and less on what he called \u201csocial issues.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to be faithful to the traditional standard of marriage,\u201d he said. \u201cNo organization allows its members to consistently disobey the rules.\u201d\nMarina Yugay, a member from Russia, said that her concerns about same-sex marriage had made her uncomfortable with the more progressive direction of many American Methodists.\n\u201cWe do need to praise God and multiply and same-sex marriage will not allow us to multiply,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you do not agree with this, you are violating the law of the creator.\u201d\nWhat happens next hinges on questions that are not just theological, but financial. For entire congregations to leave, they would most likely need to reach settlement agreements related to the potential transfer of church property, and liabilities related to the church\u2019s $23 billion pension fund.\nMajor seminaries at universities like Emory and Duke, which have supported their gay, lesbian, and transgender students, risk losing grants and funding from more influential, and conservative, churches.\nMethodism has been a major force in American life since before the Revolutionary War, and eventually grew to include a significant African-American membership in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. The denomination has split about a dozen times in its history, notably over slavery and race.\nAs the Methodist conference ended, truckloads of dirt were being readied outside the arena for a monster truck event. The hundreds of Methodist pastors began to leave, wondering how to move forward.\nMatt Miofsky, 41, leads one of the fastest growing United Methodist churches in the country, called The Gathering in St. Louis.\n\u201cI want people to know that The Gathering, and a lot of churches like it all over the country, want to welcome L.G.B.T.Q. people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to pursue a fully inclusive vision for ministry.\u201d",

At a board meeting on Monday, accessibility advocates raised alarm over reports that the agency might scale back its plans to install elevators at 50 stations in the next five years.\nMr. Byford, the president of New York City Transit, the agency that oversees the subway and buses, pledged to make elevators a top priority.\n\u201cThis president isn\u2019t wavering,\u201d Mr. Byford said. \u201cMy commitment to those 50 stations is rock solid.\u201d",

In his first speech as a candidate, he vowed to keep the Jordan Valley &ldquo;our eastern security border&rdquo; and to &ldquo;maintain security in the entire land of Israel,&rdquo; by which he means the West Bank. A campaign video credits him with sending parts of Gaza &ldquo;back to the Stone Age.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Despite all this, Gen. Benny Gantz, a former Israeli Army chief of staff and a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/world/middleeast/benny-gantz-israel-netanyahu.html?module=inline\">newly minted politician</a>, is the candidate of Israel&rsquo;s left of center for the April 9 general election. He is the candidate of what used to be called the &ldquo;peace camp.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And it turns out that his party has a good chance of winning. Last week, Mr. Gantz and Yair Lapid, who for the last seven years led the Yesh Atid party, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/world/middleeast/benny-gantz-yair-lapid-netanyahu-israel.html\">announced that they are joining forces</a> in a new party of parties they call Kahol Lavan, or Blue and White, the colors of Israel&rsquo;s flag. Mr. Gantz and Mr. Lapid will, if they win, take turns serving as prime minister, beginning with two and a half years of Mr. Gantz. Polls predict a close race, with Kahol Lavan surging in recent days.</p>\n<p>But the real lesson here isn&rsquo;t just that tactical alliances are the best way to defeat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after 10 consecutive years in office. What this election is showing is that no party with even half a chance of winning power in Israel still supports the commonly understood version of a two-state solution. Paying lip service and using the term &ldquo;two-state solution&rdquo;? Maybe. But supporting two states &mdash; in the full meaning of the term state? Not so much.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s not to say no one still believes in a fully independent Palestinian state. Dovish members of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/opinion/israel-election-labor.html\">shrinking Labor Party</a> and the left-wing Meretz Party still believe in the evacuation of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and seem to be in favor of a Palestinian state with more control of its own borders. The Arab parties, too, want a fully independent Palestine. But Labor and Meretz are unlikely to win more than a few seats in the Knesset, and no Israeli party with the realistic ambition to be the ruling party is likely to cooperate with the Arab parties.</p>\n<p>Kahol Lavan has not yet announced a platform, but here is what we can guess about its positions: It will demand that Jerusalem stay united under Israel&rsquo;s jurisdiction; it would keep the main settlement blocs in place; it will oppose a unilateral evacuation of settlements; it will want Israel&rsquo;s eastern border, in the Jordan Valley, to remain under Israel&rsquo;s control. And most important, it will likely demand that the Israeli Army has the right to operate in all of the territory between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River.</p>\n<p>When the Palestinians envision their future, they envision a real state. When Israel&rsquo;s center-left envisions the future, it envisions an entity in which the Palestinians have autonomy and one in which they can exercise their national self-determination, with the following caveat: Israel retains the right to operate militarily in this area and Israel controls all of its borders.</p>\n<p>In fact, what Mr. Gantz and the center-left now offer the Palestinians is very similar to what they might get from Mr. Netanyahu who <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/WATCH-LIVE-Netanyahu-addresses-the-GA-570153\">once called it</a> a &ldquo;state minus.&rdquo; Even Naftali Bennett, the leader of the even more right-wing party, New Right <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/opinion/naftali-bennett-for-israel-two-state-is-no-solution.html\">once agreed</a> to &ldquo;autonomy plus,&rdquo; a formulation that is different more in tone than in substance.</p>\n<p>Of course, there still might be a real difference between the center-left and the right. Maybe Mr. Gantz seriously means what he says, while Mr. Netanyahu is just playing for time. Or maybe Mr. Gantz will change his tune once he is elected and decide to withdraw unilaterally from the West Bank, or accept a different deal from the one he is now supporting, as has happened with previous prime ministers.</p>\n<p>Either way, though, the party&rsquo;s stated positions tell us plenty about Israel&rsquo;s state of mind.</p>\n<p>Israel&rsquo;s trust-the-Palestinians camp lost the argument after the 2000 Camp David summit failed and was followed by a bloody Palestinian uprising, the second Intifada. Israel&rsquo;s unilateral-withdrawal camp lost the argument following the 2005 &ldquo;disengagement&rdquo; from the Gaza Strip, which resulted in nearly constant conflict on the Israel-Gaza border. Even many Israelis who believe that the Palestinians deserve a state find it difficult to believe that Palestinian leaders and institutions can be trusted with one.</p>\n<p>Israel&rsquo;s current election cycle is quite revealing in this sense. The main parties, Likud and Kahol Lavan, both speak about security much more than about peace. Both are attacked from the right because of the likelihood that they will accept the &ldquo;deal of the century&rdquo; &mdash; President Trump&rsquo;s peace plan, which is slated to be revealed immediately after the election. Both are attacked from the left for offering essentially the same platform &mdash; Mr. Netanyahu&rsquo;s &mdash; when it comes to peace with the Palestinians.</p>\n<p>So, this is it. The two-state solution is acceptable to most Israelis, including center-right, center and center-left Israeli voters, only if the Palestinians do not really get what they consider a state. This probably means, that it cannot be a solution. Not for a very long time.</p>\n<p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\"><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.

But Labor and Meretz are unlikely to win more than a few seats in the Knesset, and no Israeli party with the realistic ambition to be the ruling party is likely to cooperate with the Arab parties.\nKahol Lavan has not yet announced a platform, but here is what we can guess about its positions: It will demand that Jerusalem stay united under Israel\u2019s jurisdiction; it would keep the main settlement blocs in place; it will oppose a unilateral evacuation of settlements; it will want Israel\u2019s eastern border, in the Jordan Valley, to remain under Israel\u2019s control. And most important, it will likely demand that the Israeli Army has the right to operate in all of the territory between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River.\nWhen the Palestinians envision their future, they envision a real state. When Israel\u2019s center-left envisions the future, it envisions an entity in which the Palestinians have autonomy and one in which they can exercise their national self-determination, with the following caveat: Israel retains the right to operate militarily in this area and Israel controls all of its borders.\nIn fact, what Mr. Gantz and the center-left now offer the Palestinians is very similar to what they might get from Mr. Netanyahu who once called it a \u201cstate minus.\u201d Even Naftali Bennett, the leader of the even more right-wing party, New Right once agreed to \u201cautonomy plus,\u201d a formulation that is different more in tone than in substance.\nOf course, there still might be a real difference between the center-left and the right. Maybe Mr. Gantz seriously means what he says, while Mr. Netanyahu is just playing for time. Or maybe Mr. Gantz will change his tune once he is elected and decide to withdraw unilaterally from the West Bank, or accept a different deal from the one he is now supporting, as has happened with previous prime ministers.\nEither way, though, the party\u2019s stated positions tell us plenty about Israel\u2019s state of mind.\nIsrael\u2019s trust-the-Palestinians camp lost the argument after the 2000 Camp David summit failed and was followed by a bloody Palestinian uprising, the second Intifada. Israel\u2019s unilateral-withdrawal camp lost the argument following the 2005 \u201cdisengagement\u201d from the Gaza Strip, which resulted in nearly constant conflict on the Israel-Gaza border. Even many Israelis who believe that the Palestinians deserve a state find it difficult to believe that Palestinian leaders and institutions can be trusted with one.\nIsrael\u2019s current election cycle is quite revealing in this sense. The main parties, Likud and Kahol Lavan, both speak about security much more than about peace. Both are attacked from the right because of the likelihood that they will accept the \u201cdeal of the century\u201d \u2014 President Trump\u2019s peace plan, which is slated to be revealed immediately after the election. Both are attacked from the left for offering essentially the same platform \u2014 Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s \u2014 when it comes to peace with the Palestinians.\nSo, this is it. The two-state solution is acceptable to most Israelis, including center-right, center and center-left Israeli voters, only if the Palestinians do not really get what they consider a state. This probably means, that it cannot be a solution. Not for a very long time.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

McCrae Dowless Jr., was among five people charged in Wake County, N.C., in connection with misconduct related to absentee ballots. The prosecutions were a vigorous legal backlash against a rare instance of election fraud and cast a still-darkening shadow over North Carolina, where state regulators recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/us/mark-harris-nc-voter-fraud.html\">ordered a new election</a> in the Ninth District after finding that Mr. Dowless had orchestrated an illicit scheme for Mark Harris, the Republican candidate.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These indictments should serve as a stern warning to anyone trying to defraud elections in North Carolina,&rdquo; Kim Strach, the executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The charges that were unsealed on Wednesday were not tied to the 2018 general election, which investigators are still examining and which Mr. Harris once appeared to have won by 905 votes. Instead, this week&rsquo;s indictments were linked to an election in 2016, when Mr. Dowless worked for a different candidate, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/us/politics/north-carolina-republican-primary-fraud.html\">the 2018 primary</a>, when he was effectively on the Harris campaign&rsquo;s payroll.</p>\n<p>But the indictments describe many of the same activities that investigators believe played out last fall, when Mr. Harris was locked in a tight race with Dan McCready, the Democratic nominee. Mr. Dowless, for instance, was accused of directing his associates to harvest absentee ballots from voters and instructing workers to sign ballot envelopes as if they had been legitimate witnesses. North Carolina law typically forbids third parties from handling absentee ballots.</p>\n<p>During parts of both the 2016 and 2018 elections, the indictments said, Mr. Dowless&rsquo;s conduct &ldquo;served to undermine the integrity of the absentee ballot process and the public&rsquo;s confidence in the outcome of the electoral process.&rdquo; According to the indictment, spoiled ballots were tabulated in both races, including the 2018 primary, when Mr. Harris defeated Representative Robert M. Pittenger by 828 votes. In that contest, Mr. Harris won 437 of the 456 ballots cast through the mail in Bladen County, the hub of Mr. Dowless&rsquo;s operation.</p>\n<p>It was not clear on Wednesday how many ballots were compromised and counted during the primary.</p>\n<p>Mr. Dowless&rsquo;s lawyer did not respond to a message, and a woman who answered the phone at her office in Elizabethtown, N.C., declined to comment. Last week, after Mr. Dowless <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/us/north-carolina-election-fraud.html\">declined to testify</a> during an evidentiary hearing before the state elections board, the lawyer, Cynthia Singletary, said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s done anything wrong.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But to others who observed the proceedings in the state capital, where regulators heard days of testimony about Mr. Dowless&rsquo;s work and reputation, he was all but certain to face prosecution &mdash; an outcome that Democrats and Republicans alike said seemed appropriate.</p>\n<p>In an interview on Friday, the day after the elections board ordered a new vote, the prosecutor overseeing the criminal inquiry said <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/us/republican-voter-fraud.html\">she expected a grand jury to return its first charges</a> within a month. On Tuesday, the grand jurors acted, but the indictments remained under seal until Mr. Dowless, 63, was arrested.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What has been challenging about this case and this investigation is that, as has been widely reported, certain activity has gone on for years,&rdquo; the prosecutor, Lorrin Freeman, said last week. &ldquo;The more interviews you do, the more interviews you have to do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Freeman, who is the Wake County district attorney and began investigating Mr. Dowless&rsquo;s activities in Bladen County after the local prosecutor recused himself, said on Wednesday that Mr. Dowless had been arrested in the morning and was taken to Raleigh for processing. Mr. Dowless&rsquo;s secured bond was set at $30,000, and he was ordered to avoid contact with anyone who was identified in the indictments.</p>\n<p>Four other people were also indicted and face charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and of illegally possessing absentee ballots. One of the four was also accused of falsely signing the voter certification on an absentee ballot.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors could eventually seek additional charges against Mr. Dowless or his associates, especially in connection with the 2018 general election. The federal authorities have not said whether they are investigating Mr. Dowless.</p>\n<p>Mr. Dowless has some familiarity with the criminal justice system, and his record includes felony convictions for perjury and fraud. But his background did not keep him from working for Mr. Harris, as well as other Democratic and Republican politicians who were seeking office in southeastern North Carolina.</p>\n<p><em>[Read: </em><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/us/north-carolina-voter-fraud.html?module=inline\">Inside a Fly-by-Night Operation to Harvest Ballots in North Carolina</a></em><em>]</em></p>\n<p>There, Mr. Dowless built <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/us/politics/north-carolina-election-fraud-dowless.html\">a reputation as a savvy organizer</a> of effective absentee ballot efforts that, at least sometimes, seemed to rely on criminal conduct and a network of workers with little legal knowledge but a need for quick cash. In 2017, just months after Mr. Dowless worked for one of Mr. Harris&rsquo;s rivals during a campaign for Congress, Mr. Harris hired him for his 2018 House bid. In doing so, Mr. Harris ignored the misgivings of one of his sons, who memorialized his concerns in an email that became public last week.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The key thing that I am fairly certain they do that is illegal is that they collected the completed absentee ballots and mail them all at once,&rdquo; John Harris wrote to his father in 2017.</p>\n<p>Mark Harris repeatedly denied that he knew of any wrongdoing by Mr. Dowless or his associates, which his campaign spent tens of thousands of dollars to underwrite. Indeed, he insisted that Mr. Dowless had explicitly assured him that his effort would involve nothing improper. But Mr. Harris, who appeared to mislead investigators during his testimony, ultimately decided last Thursday that he would support a new election.</p>\n<p>State officials are expected to meet on Monday to set a schedule for the new election, which will include a primary and be conducted as if a member of Congress had died or resigned. Mr. McCready, last year&rsquo;s Democratic candidate, said on Friday that he would enter the race. On Tuesday, Mr. Harris cited his health and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/us/mark-harris-north-carolina-election.html\">announced</a> that he would not be a candidate.</p>",

The prosecutions were a vigorous legal backlash against a rare instance of election fraud and cast a still-darkening shadow over North Carolina, where state regulators recently ordered a new election in the Ninth District after finding that Mr. Dowless had orchestrated an illicit scheme for Mark Harris, the Republican candidate.\n\u201cThese indictments should serve as a stern warning to anyone trying to defraud elections in North Carolina,\u201d Kim Strach, the executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said in a statement.\nThe charges that were unsealed on Wednesday were not tied to the 2018 general election, which investigators are still examining and which Mr. Harris once appeared to have won by 905 votes. Instead, this week\u2019s indictments were linked to an election in 2016, when Mr. Dowless worked for a different candidate, and the 2018 primary, when he was effectively on the Harris campaign\u2019s payroll.\nBut the indictments describe many of the same activities that investigators believe played out last fall, when Mr. Harris was locked in a tight race with Dan McCready, the Democratic nominee. Mr. Dowless, for instance, was accused of directing his associates to harvest absentee ballots from voters and instructing workers to sign ballot envelopes as if they had been legitimate witnesses. North Carolina law typically forbids third parties from handling absentee ballots.\nDuring parts of both the 2016 and 2018 elections, the indictments said, Mr. Dowless\u2019s conduct \u201cserved to undermine the integrity of the absentee ballot process and the public\u2019s confidence in the outcome of the electoral process.\u201d According to the indictment, spoiled ballots were tabulated in both races, including the 2018 primary, when Mr. Harris defeated Representative Robert M. Pittenger by 828 votes. In that contest, Mr. Harris won 437 of the 456 ballots cast through the mail in Bladen County, the hub of Mr. Dowless\u2019s operation.\nIt was not clear on Wednesday how many ballots were compromised and counted during the primary.\nMr. Dowless\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a message, and a woman who answered the phone at her office in Elizabethtown, N.C., declined to comment. Last week, after Mr. Dowless declined to testify during an evidentiary hearing before the state elections board, the lawyer, Cynthia Singletary, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything wrong.\u201d\nBut to others who observed the proceedings in the state capital, where regulators heard days of testimony about Mr. Dowless\u2019s work and reputation, he was all but certain to face prosecution \u2014 an outcome that Democrats and Republicans alike said seemed appropriate.\nIn an interview on Friday, the day after the elections board ordered a new vote, the prosecutor overseeing the criminal inquiry said she expected a grand jury to return its first charges within a month. On Tuesday, the grand jurors acted, but the indictments remained under seal until Mr. Dowless, 63, was arrested.\n\u201cWhat has been challenging about this case and this investigation is that, as has been widely reported, certain activity has gone on for years,\u201d the prosecutor, Lorrin Freeman, said last week. \u201cThe more interviews you do, the more interviews you have to do.\u201d\nMs. Freeman, who is the Wake County district attorney and began investigating Mr. Dowless\u2019s activities in Bladen County after the local prosecutor recused himself, said on Wednesday that Mr. Dowless had been arrested in the morning and was taken to Raleigh for processing. Mr. Dowless\u2019s secured bond was set at $30,000, and he was ordered to avoid contact with anyone who was identified in the indictments.\nFour other people were also indicted and face charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and of illegally possessing absentee ballots. One of the four was also accused of falsely signing the voter certification on an absentee ballot.\nProsecutors could eventually seek additional charges against Mr. Dowless or his associates, especially in connection with the 2018 general election. The federal authorities have not said whether they are investigating Mr. Dowless.\nMr. Dowless has some familiarity with the criminal justice system, and his record includes felony convictions for perjury and fraud. But his background did not keep him from working for Mr. Harris, as well as other Democratic and Republican politicians who were seeking office in southeastern North Carolina.\n[Read: Inside a Fly-by-Night Operation to Harvest Ballots in North Carolina]\nThere, Mr. Dowless built a reputation as a savvy organizer of effective absentee ballot efforts that, at least sometimes, seemed to rely on criminal conduct and a network of workers with little legal knowledge but a need for quick cash. In 2017, just months after Mr. Dowless worked for one of Mr. Harris\u2019s rivals during a campaign for Congress, Mr. Harris hired him for his 2018 House bid. In doing so, Mr. Harris ignored the misgivings of one of his sons, who memorialized his concerns in an email that became public last week.\n\u201cThe key thing that I am fairly certain they do that is illegal is that they collected the completed absentee ballots and mail them all at once,\u201d John Harris wrote to his father in 2017.\nMark Harris repeatedly denied that he knew of any wrongdoing by Mr. Dowless or his associates, which his campaign spent tens of thousands of dollars to underwrite. Indeed, he insisted that Mr. Dowless had explicitly assured him that his effort would involve nothing improper. But Mr. Harris, who appeared to mislead investigators during his testimony, ultimately decided last Thursday that he would support a new election.\nState officials are expected to meet on Monday to set a schedule for the new election, which will include a primary and be conducted as if a member of Congress had died or resigned. Mr. McCready, last year\u2019s Democratic candidate, said on Friday that he would enter the race. On Tuesday, Mr. Harris cited his health and announced that he would not be a candidate.",

No one knew how the war would end,&rdquo; he said in a televised speech. &ldquo;My question to India is that given the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tensions have been rising since a suicide bombing two weeks ago that hit an Indian paramilitary convoy in Kashmir, the disputed territory that has been a chronic flash point. Expectations that diplomacy and calls for calm would de-escalate the crisis have yet to show any obvious result.</p>\n<p>In New Delhi, officials confirmed that an Indian Air Force pilot was in Pakistani custody, complicating an already tough landscape for Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of hotly contested elections this spring.</p>\n<p>Indian opposition politicians seized on what they saw as the opportunity the current crisis presented: 21 opposition parties issued a statement Wednesday to condemn Mr. Modi for his &ldquo;politicization&rdquo; of the nation&rsquo;s armed forces and the current &ldquo;Pakistani misadventure.&rdquo; A slickly produced video circulated by opposition members claimed that Mr. Modi &ldquo;had no qualms capitalizing on a national tragedy&rdquo; and &ldquo;politicizing terror.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The fate of the Indian Air Force pilot in Pakistani custody was likely to further roil India ahead of the election, and New Delhi urged that he be treated with respect under the Geneva Convention, which forbids torture.</p>\n<p>By Wednesday night, three videos emerged of the pilot, including one featuring him struggling to fend off a mob of men in plainclothes in the middle of a forest. In that video, Pakistani soldiers yell at the crowd to stop beating the pilot and fire warning shots to restrain them.</p>\n<p>Another video showed the pilot blindfolded as Pakistani security officials asked him questions. A photograph from a third video, posted on Twitter by the spokesman for Pakistan&rsquo;s military, showed Pakistani security officials interrogating the pilot.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The officers of the Pakistani Army have looked after me very well, they are thorough gentlemen,&rdquo; the pilot said in the third video, his face swollen and bruised as he drank a cup of tea.</p>\n<p>A voice offscreen asks a series of questions. The Indian pilot refers to the interrogator as a &ldquo;major&rdquo; and tells him he is married and from southern India, without specifying where.</p>\n<p>The Pakistani military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, identified the Indian pilot as Wing Commander Abhi Nandan and said he had been treated well. The Indian government did not release any identifying details of the captured pilot.</p>\n<p>In India, panic intensified around Kashmir. Hundreds of residents fled their homes, while volunteers painted large red crosses on the roofs of hospitals, hoping the markings would ward off any airstrikes.</p>\n<p>In Pakistan, dozens of tanks were deployed to the border in broad daylight, underscoring the heightened state of alert as both sides scrambled to shore up their military positions. Such equipment usually is moved under the cloak of night.</p>\n<p>India&rsquo;s government confirmed that one of its MiG-21 fighter jets had been &ldquo;lost&rdquo; as it thwarted what the government said was an attempt by Pakistan&rsquo;s air force to strike an unspecified target inside India. In the encounter, a Pakistani aircraft was shot down by an Indian fighter jet, New Delhi said, a claim that Pakistan denied.</p>\n<p>Raveesh Kumar, the chief spokesman for India&rsquo;s Ministry of External Affairs, told a news conference in New Delhi that the government was still &ldquo;ascertaining the facts.&rdquo; He did not respond to Pakistan&rsquo;s claims of having downed two aircraft, instead of the single jet he acknowledged. He declined to take questions.</p>\n<p>Although both India and Pakistan say they want to resolve the current crisis diplomatically, the two governments may be beholden to their electorates, amid calls for firm military responses from both sides of the border. In Pakistan, with the capture of the Indian pilot, the current crisis has shored up support for Mr. Khan, who took office six months ago and has since faced growing opposition domestically.</p>\n<p>The crisis has not presented such an opportunity for Mr. Modi, who seemed destined just a year ago to clinch a second term as India&rsquo;s prime minister. Since then, Mr. Modi has faced considerable opposition over what critics say is his mishandling of the economy ahead of the elections this spring. The capture of the Indian pilot may only weaken his position and lead to a dangerous escalation if Mr. Modi chooses to respond militarily.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Where the danger comes in is if India does not calculate strategically but starts calculating only from the perspective of electoral benefits,&rdquo; said Ajai Shukla, a retired Indian Army colonel and a defense analyst. &ldquo;This is a game of uncertain outcomes, and escalation is a very dicey game.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>India and Pakistan are currently at a dangerous and &ldquo;unprecedented moment,&rdquo; compared with other recent military flare-ups, said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen that Prime Minister Modi is less risk averse than many of his predecessors,&rdquo; Ms. Ayres said. &ldquo;In Pakistan, we have a government led by Prime Minister Khan that doesn&rsquo;t have a political base of his own, should he decide he wants to push back on the military.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a real exhaustion and fatigue with Pakistan in India, the same fatigue that is felt by nations around the world,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a real hardening on whether talks can provide any benefits and whether Pakistan is genuine in its calls for dialogue.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Top Trump administration officials have conducted a strong effort in the past 48 hours to avert a crisis between the two nuclear-armed rivals.</p>\n<p>The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo; John R. Bolton, President Trump&rsquo;s national security adviser; Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and two senior regional military commanders, Gen. Joseph L. Votel of the Central Command and Adm. Philip S. Davidson, the head of the Pacific Command, have all been calling their Indian and Pakistani counterparts to help de-escalate tensions, administration officials said on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Pakistan&rsquo;s ambassador to the United States called on Washington to play a greater role in easing tensions between the two countries.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We would certainly like to have more, and would certainly like to see more active involvement of the United States,&rdquo; Asad M. Khan, the envoy, told reporters.</p>\n<p>The fears of escalation intensified on Tuesday when the Pakistani prime minister promised to retaliate for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/world/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-airstrikes.html\">an incursion by Indian jets hours before</a>. Those airstrikes were the first time since 1971 that the Indian Air Force had crossed the Line of Control, the de facto border between the Indian- and Pakistani-held areas of Kashmir, to strike inside Pakistan.</p>\n<p>General Ghafoor, the Pakistani military spokesman, said in a news conference on Wednesday afternoon that Pakistan&rsquo;s air force had struck six targets inside India, without crossing into the country&rsquo;s airspace. It was unclear what was struck; General Ghafoor described the target as an open area that could be hit with &ldquo;no human loss or collateral damage.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Indian Air Force responded by entering into Pakistan&rsquo;s airspace, he added, and two warplanes were shot down.</p>\n<p>By Wednesday afternoon, the Indian government closed the airspace over parts of the country&rsquo;s north that host military facilities, including Jammu, Srinagar, Amritsar, Leh and Dehradun, according to Rakesh Asthana, the director general of the Bureau of Civil Aviation and Security.</p>\n<p>Pakistan also closed large parts of its airspace, including major airports, according to a notice issued by the country&rsquo;s Civil Aviation Authority.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://in.reuters.com/article/india-kashmir-vistara/commercial-flights-to-and-from-pakistan-india-disrupted-as-tensions-rise-idINKCN1QG0NB\">Major airlines suspended flights</a> to India and Pakistan on Wednesday, including Air Canada. British Airways said it had to reroute flights headed to the countries.</p>\n<p>The Indian Air Force strike in the early hours of Tuesday morning hit what the Indian government claimed was a training camp belonging to the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed in Balakot, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, resulting in &ldquo;heavy casualties.&rdquo; But the Pakistani government and residents of the area reached by telephone said the strikes instead struck an open ravine, resulting in minimal damage.</p>\n<p>Those strikes were in response to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/world/asia/pulwama-attack-kashmir.html?module=inline\">Feb. 14 suicide bombing by Jaish-e-Mohammed </a>on an Indian paramilitary convoy in Kashmir. The suicide bombing killed 40 Indian soldiers, the worst incident in Kashmir in three decades.</p>\n<p>Jaish-e-Mohammed is classified as a terrorist group by the United Nations and blacklisted. Although the group is formally banned by Pakistan&rsquo;s government, American and Indian officials say it operates freely in the country, which Islamabad denies.</p>\n<p>In decades of conflict, India and Pakistan have each downed dozens of aircraft. In 1965, during the first major war since Partition, it is estimated that Pakistan destroyed more than 50 Indian aircraft and lost about 20 planes. In 1971, when fighting erupted in East Pakistan, now known as Bangladesh, it is estimated that the Indian Air Force lost more 40 aircraft and the Pakistanis lost more than 70.</p>\n<p>Most recently, when fighting erupted <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/11/world/indians-down-pakistan-plane-16-aboard-die.html\">over Kashmir in 1999</a>, at least one Pakistani naval aircraft was downed by an Indian fighter jet. All 16 people aboard were killed.</p>\n<p>Despite the new tensions, some analysts found reason to remain hopeful that the situation would not escalate further.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Given the fact that no one has declared war and that Pakistan did not carry out airstrikes across the international border but from within the Line of Control, that suggests there&rsquo;s a certain amount of restraint being exercised by both sides,&rdquo; said Happymon Jacob, an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, who monitors violence along the border.</p>\n<p>For now, he said, both are engaged in &ldquo;messaging for the domestic populations, to show that each side is in charge and won&rsquo;t be cowed.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Tauseef Mustafa/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Pakistan said Wednesday that it downed two Indian fighter jets and captured a pilot, escalating hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbors a day after Indian warplanes struck inside Pakistani territory for the first time in five decades.\nThe rapid turn of events raised fears that the historical animosities between India and Pakistan could be steering them toward another war.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan urged India to settle matters through talks, referring to the nuclear weapons both countries hold and the risk of further escalation.\n[To follow the growing hostilities between India and Pakistan, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.]\n\u201cAll big wars have been due to miscalculation. No one knew how the war would end,\u201d he said in a televised speech. \u201cMy question to India is that given the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation?\u201d\nTensions have been rising since a suicide bombing two weeks ago that hit an Indian paramilitary convoy in Kashmir, the disputed territory that has been a chronic flash point. Expectations that diplomacy and calls for calm would de-escalate the crisis have yet to show any obvious result.\nIn New Delhi, officials confirmed that an Indian Air Force pilot was in Pakistani custody, complicating an already tough landscape for Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of hotly contested elections this spring.\nIndian opposition politicians seized on what they saw as the opportunity the current crisis presented: 21 opposition parties issued a statement Wednesday to condemn Mr. Modi for his \u201cpoliticization\u201d of the nation\u2019s armed forces and the current \u201cPakistani misadventure.\u201d A slickly produced video circulated by opposition members claimed that Mr. Modi \u201chad no qualms capitalizing on a national tragedy\u201d and \u201cpoliticizing terror.\u201d\nThe fate of the Indian Air Force pilot in Pakistani custody was likely to further roil India ahead of the election, and New Delhi urged that he be treated with respect under the Geneva Convention, which forbids torture.\nBy Wednesday night, three videos emerged of the pilot, including one featuring him struggling to fend off a mob of men in plainclothes in the middle of a forest. In that video, Pakistani soldiers yell at the crowd to stop beating the pilot and fire warning shots to restrain them.\nAnother video showed the pilot blindfolded as Pakistani security officials asked him questions. A photograph from a third video, posted on Twitter by the spokesman for Pakistan\u2019s military, showed Pakistani security officials interrogating the pilot.\n\u201cThe officers of the Pakistani Army have looked after me very well, they are thorough gentlemen,\u201d the pilot said in the third video, his face swollen and bruised as he drank a cup of tea.\nA voice offscreen asks a series of questions. The Indian pilot refers to the interrogator as a \u201cmajor\u201d and tells him he is married and from southern India, without specifying where.\nThe Pakistani military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, identified the Indian pilot as Wing Commander Abhi Nandan and said he had been treated well. The Indian government did not release any identifying details of the captured pilot.\nIn India, panic intensified around Kashmir. Hundreds of residents fled their homes, while volunteers painted large red crosses on the roofs of hospitals, hoping the markings would ward off any airstrikes.\nIn Pakistan, dozens of tanks were deployed to the border in broad daylight, underscoring the heightened state of alert as both sides scrambled to shore up their military positions. Such equipment usually is moved under the cloak of night.\nIndia\u2019s government confirmed that one of its MiG-21 fighter jets had been \u201clost\u201d as it thwarted what the government said was an attempt by Pakistan\u2019s air force to strike an unspecified target inside India. In the encounter, a Pakistani aircraft was shot down by an Indian fighter jet, New Delhi said, a claim that Pakistan denied.\nRaveesh Kumar, the chief spokesman for India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs, told a news conference in New Delhi that the government was still \u201cascertaining the facts.\u201d He did not respond to Pakistan\u2019s claims of having downed two aircraft, instead of the single jet he acknowledged. He declined to take questions.\nAlthough both India and Pakistan say they want to resolve the current crisis diplomatically, the two governments may be beholden to their electorates, amid calls for firm military responses from both sides of the border. In Pakistan, with the capture of the Indian pilot, the current crisis has shored up support for Mr. Khan, who took office six months ago and has since faced growing opposition domestically.\nThe crisis has not presented such an opportunity for Mr. Modi, who seemed destined just a year ago to clinch a second term as India\u2019s prime minister. Since then, Mr. Modi has faced considerable opposition over what critics say is his mishandling of the economy ahead of the elections this spring. The capture of the Indian pilot may only weaken his position and lead to a dangerous escalation if Mr. Modi chooses to respond militarily.\n\u201cWhere the danger comes in is if India does not calculate strategically but starts calculating only from the perspective of electoral benefits,\u201d said Ajai Shukla, a retired Indian Army colonel and a defense analyst. \u201cThis is a game of uncertain outcomes, and escalation is a very dicey game.\u201d\nIndia and Pakistan are currently at a dangerous and \u201cunprecedented moment,\u201d compared with other recent military flare-ups, said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that Prime Minister Modi is less risk averse than many of his predecessors,\u201d Ms. Ayres said. \u201cIn Pakistan, we have a government led by Prime Minister Khan that doesn\u2019t have a political base of his own, should he decide he wants to push back on the military.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real exhaustion and fatigue with Pakistan in India, the same fatigue that is felt by nations around the world,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s been a real hardening on whether talks can provide any benefits and whether Pakistan is genuine in its calls for dialogue.\u201d\nTop Trump administration officials have conducted a strong effort in the past 48 hours to avert a crisis between the two nuclear-armed rivals.\nThe secretary of state, Mike Pompeo; John R. Bolton, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser; Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and two senior regional military commanders, Gen. Joseph L. Votel of the Central Command and Adm. Philip S. Davidson, the head of the Pacific Command, have all been calling their Indian and Pakistani counterparts to help de-escalate tensions, administration officials said on Wednesday.\nPakistan\u2019s ambassador to the United States called on Washington to play a greater role in easing tensions between the two countries.\n\u201cWe would certainly like to have more, and would certainly like to see more active involvement of the United States,\u201d Asad M. Khan, the envoy, told reporters.\nThe fears of escalation intensified on Tuesday when the Pakistani prime minister promised to retaliate for an incursion by Indian jets hours before. Those airstrikes were the first time since 1971 that the Indian Air Force had crossed the Line of Control, the de facto border between the Indian- and Pakistani-held areas of Kashmir, to strike inside Pakistan.\nGeneral Ghafoor, the Pakistani military spokesman, said in a news conference on Wednesday afternoon that Pakistan\u2019s air force had struck six targets inside India, without crossing into the country\u2019s airspace. It was unclear what was struck; General Ghafoor described the target as an open area that could be hit with \u201cno human loss or collateral damage.\u201d\nThe Indian Air Force responded by entering into Pakistan\u2019s airspace, he added, and two warplanes were shot down.\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the Indian government closed the airspace over parts of the country\u2019s north that host military facilities, including Jammu, Srinagar, Amritsar, Leh and Dehradun, according to Rakesh Asthana, the director general of the Bureau of Civil Aviation and Security.\nPakistan also closed large parts of its airspace, including major airports, according to a notice issued by the country\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority.\nMajor airlines suspended flights to India and Pakistan on Wednesday, including Air Canada. British Airways said it had to reroute flights headed to the countries.\nThe Indian Air Force strike in the early hours of Tuesday morning hit what the Indian government claimed was a training camp belonging to the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed in Balakot, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, resulting in \u201cheavy casualties.\u201d But the Pakistani government and residents of the area reached by telephone said the strikes instead struck an open ravine, resulting in minimal damage.\nThose strikes were in response to the Feb. 14 suicide bombing by Jaish-e-Mohammed on an Indian paramilitary convoy in Kashmir. The suicide bombing killed 40 Indian soldiers, the worst incident in Kashmir in three decades.\nJaish-e-Mohammed is classified as a terrorist group by the United Nations and blacklisted. Although the group is formally banned by Pakistan\u2019s government, American and Indian officials say it operates freely in the country, which Islamabad denies.\nIn decades of conflict, India and Pakistan have each downed dozens of aircraft. In 1965, during the first major war since Partition, it is estimated that Pakistan destroyed more than 50 Indian aircraft and lost about 20 planes. In 1971, when fighting erupted in East Pakistan, now known as Bangladesh, it is estimated that the Indian Air Force lost more 40 aircraft and the Pakistanis lost more than 70.\nMost recently, when fighting erupted over Kashmir in 1999, at least one Pakistani naval aircraft was downed by an Indian fighter jet. All 16 people aboard were killed.\nDespite the new tensions, some analysts found reason to remain hopeful that the situation would not escalate further.\n\u201cGiven the fact that no one has declared war and that Pakistan did not carry out airstrikes across the international border but from within the Line of Control, that suggests there\u2019s a certain amount of restraint being exercised by both sides,\u201d said Happymon Jacob, an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, who monitors violence along the border.\nFor now, he said, both are engaged in \u201cmessaging for the domestic populations, to show that each side is in charge and won\u2019t be cowed.\u201d",

I would not say I&rsquo;m pessimistic.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A ceremony to sign a &ldquo;joint agreement&rdquo; between the two leaders was scheduled to take place in the afternoon, raising expectations for a diplomatic breakthrough that could include steps to declare a permanent peace on the divided Korean Peninsula and build a new relationship with a country that has been a bitter adversary of the United States for nearly 70 years.</p>\n<p>The historic summit meeting, the second between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim in eight months, began unfolding on Wednesday in the shadow of events in Washington.

And I look forward to watching it happen and helping it to happen.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The two leaders met Thursday, as they had Wednesday, at the Metropole hotel in downtown Hanoi, the capital of a country that is undergoing rapid economic growth decades after a Communist army defeated the American military and their South Vietnamese allies in a costly civil war. American officials hope firsthand evidence of that economic transformation will help persuade Mr. Kim to end his nuclear program and establish robust trade ties with the United States, South Korea and other nations.</p>\n<p>The hotel, one block east of Hoan Kiem Lake, has suites named after prominent past guests &mdash; Charlie Chaplin, Graham Greene and Somerset Maugham. But it is safe to say that few dinners there have featured as unlikely a pairing as the one on Wednesday night.</p>\n<p><em>[Read </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/world/asia/trump-kim-summit-vietnam.html\"><em>our coverage of the first day of the summit meeting</em></a><em> here.]</em></p>\n<p>American negotiators, including Stephen E. Biegun, the State Department&rsquo;s special representative for North Korea, arrived in Hanoi several days ahead of Mr. Trump to meet with North Korean counterparts and lay the groundwork for Thursday&rsquo;s talks.</p>\n<p>The United States hopes to get Mr. Kim to agree to meaningful steps toward denuclearization, in contrast to the results of the meeting between the two leaders last June in Singapore.</p>\n<p>At the end of that meeting, officials issued a vague communiqu&eacute; that said the countries would work together on four points: improving relations, establishing a &ldquo;lasting and stable peace regime&rdquo; on the Korean Peninsula, affirming that Pyongyang would work toward &ldquo;complete denuclearization&rdquo; of the peninsula, and the mutual return of remains from soldiers killed in the Korean War.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump then said on Twitter that there was no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea. But by this year, senior American officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, were asserting the opposite &mdash; that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/us/politics/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo.html\">the threat remained</a> and that the North had done little to dismantle its nuclear program, despite Mr. Pompeo&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-arms.html\">attempts at diplomacy</a>. Mr. Pompeo attended the Wednesday dinner with Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s success or failure in moving toward <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/22/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-weapons.html\">denuclearizing North Korea</a> &mdash; what the meetings are supposed to be all about &mdash; may hinge on one measure: the fate of a remote nuclear site surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, under watch by American intelligence since the early 1980s.</p>\n<p>The site, called Yongbyon, is the centerpiece of North Korean nuclear-fuel making.</p>\n<p>If Mr. Trump can get the production of nuclear fuel stopped at Yongbyon, he will have at least &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; the program, though at a moment when the North has 30 to 60 nuclear weapons. Halting production would mean dismantling the old reactor, neutralizing a new one, and taking apart a uranium enrichment facility. (American intelligence officials say they believe there is at least one other such facility apart from Yongbyon.)</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump has been told that if he can get the facilities destroyed, he will have made progress no other president ever has. If he cannot, the North Koreans will just keep producing fuel, and maybe new bombs, while the talks drag on.</p>\n<p>And of course, Mr. Trump needs to get Mr. Kim to agree to readmit international inspectors, who were thrown out years ago. It would be their job to document which facilities were being taken apart, and to track the stockpiles of uranium and plutonium.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what denuclearization would look like, but this will be a very hard job,&rdquo; Joseph Y. Yun, a former North Korea envoy for the State Department, said in Hanoi.</p>\n<p>For their part, the North Koreans want concessions from the United States that could jump-start their economy, like sanctions relief.</p>\n<p>Jean H. Lee, a Korea expert at the Wilson Center, a Washington-based research organization, said of Mr. Kim that &ldquo;he does want a changed relationship with the United States, and to improve his country&rsquo;s shattered economy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But we need to remember that he sacrificed his people&rsquo;s well-being, making decisions that deprived them of food, clean water, electricity, heat and medicine, in order to build nuclear weapons,&rdquo; Ms. Lee added. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be willing to give his weapons up readily, and may be prepared to sacrifice his people again if things don&rsquo;t go his way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Kim also wants an end-of-war declaration, which would be short of a peace treaty, to replace the armistice reached in 1953 that halted the Korean War.

                "text": "HANOI, Vietnam \u2014 After exchanging praise over dinner, President Trump on Thursday morning opened a day of formal talks with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, a meeting aimed at once again trying to persuade the North to dismantle its nuclear weapons program and join the global economy.\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak necessarily for today, but I can say a little bit longer term and over a period of time I know we are going to have a fantastic success with respect to Chairman Kim and North Korea,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\u201cSpeed is not important to me,\u201d he added. \u201cI very much appreciate not testing,\u201d he said in referring to the North Koreans\u2019 halt since late 2017 to its nuclear testing.\nMr. Kim, when asked by an American reporter whether he thought he would reach a deal with Mr. Trump, said: \u201c \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say. I would not say I\u2019m pessimistic.\u201d\nA ceremony to sign a \u201cjoint agreement\u201d between the two leaders was scheduled to take place in the afternoon, raising expectations for a diplomatic breakthrough that could include steps to declare a permanent peace on the divided Korean Peninsula and build a new relationship with a country that has been a bitter adversary of the United States for nearly 70 years.\nThe historic summit meeting, the second between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim in eight months, began unfolding on Wednesday in the shadow of events in Washington. Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, riveted the American public with a searing day of testimony that could intensify the criminal and civil investigations swirling around the president.\nBefore Mr. Cohen began speaking to the House Oversight Committee, Mr. Trump accused him of lying in a tweet from Hanoi, writing, \u201cHe is lying in order to reduce his prison time.\u201d\nHours afterward on Wednesday, Mr. Trump was shaking hands with Mr. Kim against a backdrop of North Korean and American flags before dinner, and listening to the young dictator praise his leadership.\n\u201cI truly believe that this successful and great meeting that we are having today is thanks to the courageous decision, political decision, that your team, Mr. President, reached,\u201d Mr. Kim said.\nWearing a black, Asian-style suit, he sat and smiled as Mr. Trump spoke to him.\n\u201cI think your country has tremendous economic potential,\u201d the American president said. \u201cI think you will have a tremendous future with your country \u2014 a great leader. And I look forward to watching it happen and helping it to happen.\u201d\nThe two leaders met Thursday, as they had Wednesday, at the Metropole hotel in downtown Hanoi, the capital of a country that is undergoing rapid economic growth decades after a Communist army defeated the American military and their South Vietnamese allies in a costly civil war. American officials hope firsthand evidence of that economic transformation will help persuade Mr. Kim to end his nuclear program and establish robust trade ties with the United States, South Korea and other nations.\nThe hotel, one block east of Hoan Kiem Lake, has suites named after prominent past guests \u2014 Charlie Chaplin, Graham Greene and Somerset Maugham. But it is safe to say that few dinners there have featured as unlikely a pairing as the one on Wednesday night.\n[Read our coverage of the first day of the summit meeting here.]\nAmerican negotiators, including Stephen E. Biegun, the State Department\u2019s special representative for North Korea, arrived in Hanoi several days ahead of Mr. Trump to meet with North Korean counterparts and lay the groundwork for Thursday\u2019s talks.\nThe United States hopes to get Mr. Kim to agree to meaningful steps toward denuclearization, in contrast to the results of the meeting between the two leaders last June in Singapore.\nAt the end of that meeting, officials issued a vague communiqu\u00e9 that said the countries would work together on four points: improving relations, establishing a \u201clasting and stable peace regime\u201d on the Korean Peninsula, affirming that Pyongyang would work toward \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the peninsula, and the mutual return of remains from soldiers killed in the Korean War.\nMr. Trump then said on Twitter that there was no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea. But by this year, senior American officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, were asserting the opposite \u2014 that the threat remained and that the North had done little to dismantle its nuclear program, despite Mr. Pompeo\u2019s attempts at diplomacy. Mr. Pompeo attended the Wednesday dinner with Mr. Trump.\nMr. Trump\u2019s success or failure in moving toward denuclearizing North Korea \u2014 what the meetings are supposed to be all about \u2014 may hinge on one measure: the fate of a remote nuclear site surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, under watch by American intelligence since the early 1980s.\nThe site, called Yongbyon, is the centerpiece of North Korean nuclear-fuel making.\nIf Mr. Trump can get the production of nuclear fuel stopped at Yongbyon, he will have at least \u201cfrozen\u201d the program, though at a moment when the North has 30 to 60 nuclear weapons. Halting production would mean dismantling the old reactor, neutralizing a new one, and taking apart a uranium enrichment facility. (American intelligence officials say they believe there is at least one other such facility apart from Yongbyon.)\nMr. Trump has been told that if he can get the facilities destroyed, he will have made progress no other president ever has. If he cannot, the North Koreans will just keep producing fuel, and maybe new bombs, while the talks drag on.\nAnd of course, Mr. Trump needs to get Mr. Kim to agree to readmit international inspectors, who were thrown out years ago. It would be their job to document which facilities were being taken apart, and to track the stockpiles of uranium and plutonium.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what denuclearization would look like, but this will be a very hard job,\u201d Joseph Y. Yun, a former North Korea envoy for the State Department, said in Hanoi.\nFor their part, the North Koreans want concessions from the United States that could jump-start their economy, like sanctions relief.\nJean H. Lee, a Korea expert at the Wilson Center, a Washington-based research organization, said of Mr. Kim that \u201che does want a changed relationship with the United States, and to improve his country\u2019s shattered economy.\u201d\n\u201cBut we need to remember that he sacrificed his people\u2019s well-being, making decisions that deprived them of food, clean water, electricity, heat and medicine, in order to build nuclear weapons,\u201d Ms. Lee added. \u201cHe won\u2019t be willing to give his weapons up readily, and may be prepared to sacrifice his people again if things don\u2019t go his way.\u201d\nMr. Kim also wants an end-of-war declaration, which would be short of a peace treaty, to replace the armistice reached in 1953 that halted the Korean War. Mr. Trump reportedly agreed to just that when the men met in Singapore, but he pulled back after his advisers said it would be bad negotiating strategy to give the North a formal end to hostilities in return for precious little.\nOne likely outcome of the summit meetings is that Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim will agree that South Korea can step up its direct economic interchanges with the North, even if United Nations sanctions on the country remain.\nIn the morning, Mr. Trump went to Hanoi\u2019s presidential palace to meet with President Nguyen Phu Trong of Vietnam, who is also the country\u2019s Communist Party chief. \u201cWe both felt very good about having this summit in Vietnam because you really are an example of what can happen with good thinking,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a conference table with senior officials from both governments before the meeting began.\nMr. Trump and Mr. Trong walked into a ballroom later and performed a signing ceremony for commercial business deals, including the sale of 100 Boeing 737 Max jets to VietJet Air, a private Vietnamese airline, for nearly $13 billion at list prices, and 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners to Bamboo Airways, another private airline in Vietnam, for $3 billion.\nAfterward, Mr. Trump met with Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc of Vietnam. As Mr. Trump strode along a red carpet at the government office, about 100 schoolchildren in white uniforms lined the path and waved the bright-red socialist flag of Vietnam and the American flag.\nWith the two Vietnamese leaders, Mr. Trump also discussed what the White House called \u201ca free and open Indo-Pacific with shared principles of respect for sovereignty, peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, and freedom of navigation and overflight.\u201d\nThat was a reference to Chinese military expansionism in the South China Sea and in other disputed or international waters.\nThe Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, has been in Vietnam this week and told Russian state-run news media that \u201cthe U.S. is even asking our advice\u201d on matters to do with the summit meeting.\nIn a speech in Ho Chi Minh City on Monday, Mr. Lavrov said that while he hoped for progress in bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea, \u201cour goal is much broader, in the context of long-term stabilization, to develop a mechanism of peace and security in Northeast Asia.\u201d",

Instead, it was part of a systematic campaign to silence dissidents that was overseen by a top aide to Prince Mohammed, Saud al-Qahtani, and led in the field by an intelligence officer who had traveled abroad with the crown prince, Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb.\nAccording to the American officials, the team was worked so hard that last June it asked for holiday bonuses.\nSaudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy with a particularly stern form of Islam, has always been high on the list of human-rights violators. But with the ascent of Prince Mohammed\u2019s father, King Salman, to the throne in January 2015, and with Prince Mohammed\u2019s subsequent emergence as the heir and the power behind the throne, the pace of arrests, repression and executions rose to levels unseen in two decades.\nAccording to a Saudi group that tracks political prisoners, Prisoners of Conscience, more than 2,600 Saudi dissidents \u2014 including scientists, writers, lawyers and women\u2019s rights campaigners \u2014 were locked up in the kingdom while the crown prince was building his image abroad as a reformer. His celebrated decision to let women drive, in the best known example, was accompanied by the imprisonment of the women who had campaigned for the right.\nThe revelation that the killing of Mr. Khashoggi was part of a systematic campaign against dissidents strips away any remaining illusions about Prince Mohammed.

Weintraub of Bucks County said the shooting of the man, Brian Riling, &ldquo;was neither justified, nor criminal, but was excused.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The officer violated a department rule that a Taser be worn on the opposite hip from a firearm, but he &ldquo;did not possess the criminal mental state required to be guilty of a crime under state law,&rdquo; Mr. Weintraub said in a statement that quoted his letter to the police chief.</p>\n<p>The statement refers to a Pennsylvania law that states that a person cannot be charged with a crime &ldquo;if he makes a mistake as a matter of fact for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The officer, who was not identified because charges were not filed, did violate the department&rsquo;s policy by wearing the Taser on his right side, in front of his firearm, the district attorney&rsquo;s investigation found. Officers are required to wear Tasers on their non-dominant side, known as the &ldquo;cross-draw position.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Video of the March 3 incident, released by the district attorney&rsquo;s office, showed Mr. Riling entering a holding cell and removing his belt in response to an officer&rsquo;s instructions. In the process, &ldquo;a white, rectangular object consistent with a drug baggie&rdquo; fell from his waistband to the floor, Mr. Weintraub said. When Mr. Riling moved to cover the object with his foot, an officer pushed him onto a bench in the cell, resulting in a skirmish.</p>\n<p>A second officer entered the cell and yelled &ldquo;Taser!&rdquo; before shooting Mr. Riling in the torso with his gun.</p>\n<p>Mr. Riling was taken to a hospital in critical condition, where he spent several days before being released, according to the district attorney&rsquo;s statement.</p>\n<p>The officer who fired the gun was on paid administrative leave until he retired from the police department, three days before the district attorney released his findings.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Given the totality of circumstances, the officer would have been justified in using his Taser to regain control of Riling inside the holding cell,&rdquo; Mr. Weintraub said, &ldquo;as the officer had a reasonable belief the scuffle posed a danger to his fellow officer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On the day of the shooting, Mr. Riling was in police custody on charges of intimidation and retaliation against a victim, simple assault and related offenses from an incident on March 3, Mr. Weintraub said in his statement. He was also charged with burglarizing the same victim&rsquo;s home.</p>\n<p>The officer &ldquo;was aware of these two criminal episodes ahead of the holding cell incident, and had himself heard threats of violence made by Riling during a phone call between Riling and the previously mentioned victim,&rdquo; Mr. Weintraub said.</p>\n<p>William Goldman, a lawyer representing the officer, told <a href=\"https://www.theintell.com/news/20190412/bucks-da-new-hope-police-involved-shooting-not-justified-but-excused\">The Intelligencer newspaper</a> that the officer had acted &ldquo;in defense of a fellow officer with a large man.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The New Hope Police Department thanked the district attorney&rsquo;s office for the investigation in <a href=\"http://www.newhopepd.org/alertsannouncements.html\">a statement posted online</a>.</p>\n<p>Chief Michael V. Cummings of the New Hope police could not be reached for comment on Sunday night.</p>\n<p>Police departments <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/nyregion/new-york-police-embracing-a-weapon-they-have-a-complicated-past-with-tasers.html\">have a complicated past with Taser stun guns</a>, which shoot electrified barbs instead of bullets. The devices became a popular tool for police officers in the 2000s as a less-lethal weapon, like pepper spray or batons.</p>\n<p>But some <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/18/theres-no-evidence-tasers-reduce-police-use-of-firearms-new-study-shows.html\">studies have shown there</a> is no evidence that the adoption of Tasers reduces the use of firearms by police officers. And Tasers, too, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-taser-911/\">can be deadly</a>.</p>\n<p>Cases of officers mistaking a Taser for a gun, however, are rare, said <a href=\"https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/criminology_and_criminal_justice/our_people/directory/alpert_geoffrey.php\">Geoffrey P. Alpert</a>, a criminologist at the University of South Carolina who studies the use of force.</p>\n<p>It demonstrates that the officer isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;well-trained or is so hyped up he or she doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In my estimation,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no real excuse for it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In 2009, a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer fatally shot a young, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/09/us/09oakland.html\">unarmed man on New Year&rsquo;s Day</a>, while the man, Oscar Grant III, was lying face down on a transit platform in Oakland, Calif.

                "text": "Bucks County District Attorney's Office\nA police officer in Pennsylvania will not be charged after shooting and wounding an unarmed man in the torso in the \u201chonest but mistaken\u201d belief he was using a Taser, the authorities said.\nIn a letter to the police chief of New Hope, a town about 40 miles northeast of Philadelphia, District Attorney Matthew D. Weintraub of Bucks County said the shooting of the man, Brian Riling, \u201cwas neither justified, nor criminal, but was excused.\u201d\nThe officer violated a department rule that a Taser be worn on the opposite hip from a firearm, but he \u201cdid not possess the criminal mental state required to be guilty of a crime under state law,\u201d Mr. Weintraub said in a statement that quoted his letter to the police chief.\nThe statement refers to a Pennsylvania law that states that a person cannot be charged with a crime \u201cif he makes a mistake as a matter of fact for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse.\u201d\nThe officer, who was not identified because charges were not filed, did violate the department\u2019s policy by wearing the Taser on his right side, in front of his firearm, the district attorney\u2019s investigation found. Officers are required to wear Tasers on their non-dominant side, known as the \u201ccross-draw position.\u201d\nVideo of the March 3 incident, released by the district attorney\u2019s office, showed Mr. Riling entering a holding cell and removing his belt in response to an officer\u2019s instructions. In the process, \u201ca white, rectangular object consistent with a drug baggie\u201d fell from his waistband to the floor, Mr. Weintraub said. When Mr. Riling moved to cover the object with his foot, an officer pushed him onto a bench in the cell, resulting in a skirmish.\nA second officer entered the cell and yelled \u201cTaser!\u201d before shooting Mr. Riling in the torso with his gun.\nMr. Riling was taken to a hospital in critical condition, where he spent several days before being released, according to the district attorney\u2019s statement.\nThe officer who fired the gun was on paid administrative leave until he retired from the police department, three days before the district attorney released his findings.\n\u201cGiven the totality of circumstances, the officer would have been justified in using his Taser to regain control of Riling inside the holding cell,\u201d Mr. Weintraub said, \u201cas the officer had a reasonable belief the scuffle posed a danger to his fellow officer.\u201d\nOn the day of the shooting, Mr. Riling was in police custody on charges of intimidation and retaliation against a victim, simple assault and related offenses from an incident on March 3, Mr. Weintraub said in his statement. He was also charged with burglarizing the same victim\u2019s home.\nThe officer \u201cwas aware of these two criminal episodes ahead of the holding cell incident, and had himself heard threats of violence made by Riling during a phone call between Riling and the previously mentioned victim,\u201d Mr. Weintraub said.\nWilliam Goldman, a lawyer representing the officer, told The Intelligencer newspaper that the officer had acted \u201cin defense of a fellow officer with a large man.\u201d\nThe New Hope Police Department thanked the district attorney\u2019s office for the investigation in a statement posted online.\nChief Michael V. Cummings of the New Hope police could not be reached for comment on Sunday night.\nPolice departments have a complicated past with Taser stun guns, which shoot electrified barbs instead of bullets. The devices became a popular tool for police officers in the 2000s as a less-lethal weapon, like pepper spray or batons.\nBut some studies have shown there is no evidence that the adoption of Tasers reduces the use of firearms by police officers. And Tasers, too, can be deadly.\nCases of officers mistaking a Taser for a gun, however, are rare, said Geoffrey P. Alpert, a criminologist at the University of South Carolina who studies the use of force.\nIt demonstrates that the officer isn\u2019t \u201cwell-trained or is so hyped up he or she doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\u201cIn my estimation,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no real excuse for it.\u201d\nIn 2009, a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer fatally shot a young, unarmed man on New Year\u2019s Day, while the man, Oscar Grant III, was lying face down on a transit platform in Oakland, Calif. The officer said that the killing was an accident and that he had mistaken his firearm for his Taser. He was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter.\nIn 2016, a former volunteer sheriff\u2019s deputy in Tulsa, Okla., was convicted of killing a suspect when he accidentally fired his handgun instead of a Taser.\nRobert J. Louden, an emeritus professor of criminal justice at Georgian Court University and a former chief hostage negotiator for the New York Police Department, said Tasers were normally worn on the non-gun side of an officer\u2019s the belt to \u201cminimize the probability or the possibility of drawing the wrong weapon.\u201d\n\u201cIn the heat of battle,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople do things that turn out not to be what they wanted to do.\u201d\nUsing a Taser to \u201ctemporarily disable\u201d a person is preferable to reaching for a gun, he said.\nBut, he added, the question remains: \u201cWhy do you say \u2018Taser\u2019 and then use your right hand to shoot somebody with a gun?\u201d",

Some, like Apple and Amazon, are meant to be aggregators &mdash; selling both original content and offering shows from channels like HBO &mdash; making them similar to traditional cable providers. Others, like AT&amp;T and Disney, have positioned themselves as services that sell only their content &mdash; for now.</p>\n<p>But Netflix remains the industry leader. The company has come a long way since its early days of mailing off DVDs in red envelopes. It added 7.8 million new customers through the end of March, according to the first-quarter report it issued on Tuesday, for a total of 148 million across the globe, with 60 million in the United States. Its subscriber growth has slowed, however, more in the United States than elsewhere, partly because of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/business/media/netflix-price-increase.html\">price increases</a> and stiffening competition. The streaming service <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/quarterly_reports/2019/q1/FINAL-Q119-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\">booked</a> $344 million in profit on $4.5 billion in sales in the quarter ending in March.</p>\n<p>For the moment, Netflix is soundly beating its streaming rivals &mdash; in subscribers, viewing time and library of content. But one is closer than the others: Hulu.</p>\n<p>Hulu has long had trouble steering its own course, because it has had to deal with multiple corporate overlords since it was founded in 2007.</p>\n<p>For much of its existence, its ownership was split among several companies: Disney, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and more recently Time Warner. The ownership of this built-by-committee digital outfit has become less complicated in recent days.</p>\n<p>When Disney formally completed its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/business/media/walt-disney-21st-century-fox-deal.html\">acquisition</a> of most of Fox last month, it became Hulu&rsquo;s majority owner. Hulu rid itself of another stakeholder on Monday, when AT&amp;T &mdash; which <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/business/media/att-time-warner-appeal.html\">acquired</a> Time Warner last year &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/04/15/business/ap-us-hulu-att-sale.html\">sold the stake</a> that once belonged to Time Warner back to Hulu. Now Disney is the controlling owner, and Comcast has the smaller piece.</p>\n<p>Hulu originally made a name for itself as a next-day streamer of shows from other networks. That started to change a few years ago, when it got into the business of creating its own programming. Most notably, it gave the green light to &ldquo;The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale,&rdquo; the first streaming-native show to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/arts/television/emmy-awards.html\">win an Emmy</a> for best drama series.</p>\n<p>While it may not generate much hype, Hulu is Netflix&rsquo;s closest competitor, despite some key differences between the two companies.</p>\n<p>Almost stubbornly, Netflix sells one thing &mdash; a deep assortment of original and licensed shows and films meant to please almost every niche.</p>\n<p>Hulu, on the other hand, has three products that may better reflect what the future of streaming will look like. It has a live-TV service that replicates a small cable bundle at $45 a month; a video-on-demand service that sells for $12 a month without ads (this one acts most like Netflix); and a streaming service with advertising that costs $6 a month.</p>\n<p>The last one is Hulu&rsquo;s most lucrative business and points to future profits. Even though it charges $6, the service generates more than $15 in revenue per subscriber each month, because of the high-cost advertising sold against those customers, according to two people familiar with the business.</p>\n<p>That would explain why Hulu lowered the price of the ads-based service by $2 this year &mdash; and it might also explain NBCUniversal&rsquo;s interest in starting its own <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/business/media/nbc-executive-changes.html\">ad-based streaming network</a> by 2020.</p>\n<p>Roku, the maker of streaming boxes, is also experiencing fast growth from its advertising-driven Roku channel, a free streaming app. And in January, Viacom spent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/business/media/viacom-plutotv-streaming.html\">$340 million for PlutoTV</a>, another ad-based streaming provider.</p>\n<p>Last year, Hulu took in more than $1.5 billion in advertising, a 45 percent jump from the previous year.

But it&rsquo;s not just about size &mdash; it&rsquo;s important to consider how fast each has grown relative to the other.</p><p>When Time Warner bought a 10 percent stake in Hulu in August 2016, it paid $583 million, implying a valuation of $5.8 billion. Nearly two years later, Disney&rsquo;s advisers pegged Hulu at a $9.3 billion valuation. This month, after AT&amp;T sold its 9.5 percent stake for $1.43 billion, the valuation shot up to $15 billion. (Note: AT&amp;T forfeited 0.5 percent of its stake when it didn&rsquo;t make continued investments into Hulu. That small portion went back to Hulu.)

It made $1.2 billion in profit last year and is expected to make more than $2 billion this year and $3 billion next year. </p><p>Netflix&rsquo;s appetite for content means it has to keep spending big, however, resulting in what&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;negative free cash flow.&rdquo; More money is going out the door than coming in &mdash; a difference that Netflix covers by borrowing even more.

The company said it planned to rely on its own revenue to fund its content starting next year.</p></li></ul>",

                "text": "Manu Fernandez/Associated Press\nEveryone\u2019s gunning for Netflix.\nAmazon, AT&T, Apple and the Walt Disney Company have spent billions to create or bolster their own streaming networks to take on the giant in the field. Some, like Apple and Amazon, are meant to be aggregators \u2014 selling both original content and offering shows from channels like HBO \u2014 making them similar to traditional cable providers. Others, like AT&T and Disney, have positioned themselves as services that sell only their content \u2014 for now.\nBut Netflix remains the industry leader. The company has come a long way since its early days of mailing off DVDs in red envelopes. It added 7.8 million new customers through the end of March, according to the first-quarter report it issued on Tuesday, for a total of 148 million across the globe, with 60 million in the United States. Its subscriber growth has slowed, however, more in the United States than elsewhere, partly because of price increases and stiffening competition. The streaming service booked $344 million in profit on $4.5 billion in sales in the quarter ending in March.\nFor the moment, Netflix is soundly beating its streaming rivals \u2014 in subscribers, viewing time and library of content. But one is closer than the others: Hulu.\nHulu has long had trouble steering its own course, because it has had to deal with multiple corporate overlords since it was founded in 2007.\nFor much of its existence, its ownership was split among several companies: Disney, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and more recently Time Warner. The ownership of this built-by-committee digital outfit has become less complicated in recent days.\nWhen Disney formally completed its acquisition of most of Fox last month, it became Hulu\u2019s majority owner. Hulu rid itself of another stakeholder on Monday, when AT&T \u2014 which acquired Time Warner last year \u2014 sold the stake that once belonged to Time Warner back to Hulu. Now Disney is the controlling owner, and Comcast has the smaller piece.\nHulu originally made a name for itself as a next-day streamer of shows from other networks. That started to change a few years ago, when it got into the business of creating its own programming. Most notably, it gave the green light to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d the first streaming-native show to win an Emmy for best drama series.\nWhile it may not generate much hype, Hulu is Netflix\u2019s closest competitor, despite some key differences between the two companies.\nAlmost stubbornly, Netflix sells one thing \u2014 a deep assortment of original and licensed shows and films meant to please almost every niche.\nHulu, on the other hand, has three products that may better reflect what the future of streaming will look like. It has a live-TV service that replicates a small cable bundle at $45 a month; a video-on-demand service that sells for $12 a month without ads (this one acts most like Netflix); and a streaming service with advertising that costs $6 a month.\nThe last one is Hulu\u2019s most lucrative business and points to future profits. Even though it charges $6, the service generates more than $15 in revenue per subscriber each month, because of the high-cost advertising sold against those customers, according to two people familiar with the business.\nThat would explain why Hulu lowered the price of the ads-based service by $2 this year \u2014 and it might also explain NBCUniversal\u2019s interest in starting its own ad-based streaming network by 2020.\nRoku, the maker of streaming boxes, is also experiencing fast growth from its advertising-driven Roku channel, a free streaming app. And in January, Viacom spent $340 million for PlutoTV, another ad-based streaming provider.\nLast year, Hulu took in more than $1.5 billion in advertising, a 45 percent jump from the previous year. Randy Freer, its chief executive, expects the ad market for online television to grow to $50 billion within three years.\n\u201cThis uniquely positions Hulu to benefit from leading brands into the digital video ad market,\u201d Mr. Freer said at Disney\u2019s investor presentation last week. \u201cHulu does this with a viewer-first ad experience that has less commercial interruption, with ad breaks that are shorter and ads that are more relevant.\u201d\nNetflix and Hulu aren\u2019t necessarily either-or propositions for consumers. Many people pay for both.\nReed Hastings, Netflix\u2019s founder and chief executive, doesn\u2019t anticipate that new competition will cut into Netflix\u2019s business, because consumer appetite for streaming content still outpaces what\u2019s currently available, or what will be available.\n\u201cGreat competition makes you better,\u201d he said of the newly announced competitors, Apple and Disney, in the company earnings call Tuesday. He added of all the others, \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of competition out there, which is great for consumers, and it\u2019s exciting for us.\u201d\nWhile Netflix remains well in the lead, a look at the numbers suggests that Hulu could prove a formidable rival. Let\u2019s take a look:\nValuation: Hulu is worth $15 billion, Netflix $157 billion. But it\u2019s not just about size \u2014 it\u2019s important to consider how fast each has grown relative to the other.\nWhen Time Warner bought a 10 percent stake in Hulu in August 2016, it paid $583 million, implying a valuation of $5.8 billion. Nearly two years later, Disney\u2019s advisers pegged Hulu at a $9.3 billion valuation. This month, after AT&T sold its 9.5 percent stake for $1.43 billion, the valuation shot up to $15 billion. (Note: AT&T forfeited 0.5 percent of its stake when it didn\u2019t make continued investments into Hulu. That small portion went back to Hulu.) That means Hulu\u2019s valuation jumped by 2.6 times in two and a half years.\nHere\u2019s the kicker: Netflix\u2019s value grew by approximately 3.8 times in the same period. But keep in mind that, because Netflix is openly traded on the public market, it has many more potential buyers at any given point. Hulu is effectively a private operation, with few available buyers. You have to wonder if Hulu might be more valuable if it were spun out as a separate, publicly traded company with Disney retaining a significant, or even a controlling, stake.\nSubscribers: As of December, Hulu had 25 million subscribers \u2014 eight million more than it had the previous year, a 47 percent increase. Netflix had 58 million paying members in the United States at the end of last year \u2014 a 12 percent bump from the previous year. (Globally, Netflix had 139 million, a 26 percent increase.)\nNetflix\u2019s growth has started to slow \u2014 and markedly so, when compared with Hulu\u2019s.\nBusiness: Both Hulu and Netflix blow through a lot of cash. Hulu has been a money-losing operation from the start. It is expected to lose $1.5 billion this year and about the same next year. But Disney has said it expects Hulu to start turning a profit by 2023.\nNetflix records a profit on its books, but much of that comes from an accounting rule that allows it to account for some costs later on down the line. It made $1.2 billion in profit last year and is expected to make more than $2 billion this year and $3 billion next year.\nNetflix\u2019s appetite for content means it has to keep spending big, however, resulting in what\u2019s known as \u201cnegative free cash flow.\u201d More money is going out the door than coming in \u2014 a difference that Netflix covers by borrowing even more. The company burned through $3 billion last year and $2 billion the year before that. But that won\u2019t last forever. The company said it planned to rely on its own revenue to fund its content starting next year.",

(In Connecticut, a man <a href=\"https://www.greenwichtime.com/local/article/Former-Stamford-man-charged-with-sex-assault-13720202.php\">was recently arraigned</a> on charges that he kidnapped and raped two women who thought he was their driver.

And a <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/30/technology/uber-driver-sexual-assault/index.html\">2018 CNN report</a> found that 103 Uber drivers and 18 Lyft drivers had been accused of sexual assault or abuse.</p>\n<p>Uber and Lyft have been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/technology/ubers-system-for-screening-drivers-comes-under-scrutiny.html\">criticized</a> for not sufficiently <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-san-francisco-serial-rape-20180717-story.html\">evaluating</a> their drivers and not prioritizing passenger safety, prompting some cities to place temporary <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/business/uber-london.html?module=inline\">bans or restrictions</a> on the services. Both companies say passenger safety is their top priority and have stood by their background-check processes.</p>\n<p>After the attack on Josephson, Uber re-upped its public safety awareness campaign called &ldquo;Check Your Ride,&rdquo; first <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/newsroom/checkyourride/\">introduced in 2017</a>, urging users to take certain precautions: Match the license plate, car make and model to what the app displays, and check the driver&rsquo;s photograph before getting in.</p>\n<p>Of course, as critics put it: The onus should not be on <em>women</em> to vigilantly create safe spaces for themselves &mdash; and yet often it is.</p>\n<p>Here are a few safety tips I always abide by.</p>\n<p>______</p>\n<p><strong>Ask the driver&rsquo;s name. </strong></p>\n<p>In addition to asking the driver for your name, ask your driver for his or her name and look closely to make sure the photo on the app matches. If the driver&rsquo;s phone is mounted on the dashboard, look to see if it&rsquo;s displaying your name.</p>\n<p>______</p>\n<p><strong>Share your status. </strong></p>\n<p>Share your trip details with friends through the sharing option on the app. By adding your destination and sharing through a text, others can watch your ride, in real time, on a map. Uber and Via monitor drivers&rsquo; routes, sending alerts to their staff if the cars go off course.</p>\n<p>______</p>\n<p><strong>Match the light.</strong></p>\n<p>Some Uber and Lyft vehicles have illuminated windshield icons called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNhVMTAlpv8\">Beacon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eig5e8rx_Pw\">Amp</a> that change color to match a hue on a passenger&rsquo;s app. If this is available to you, make sure the color matches. Lawmakers in South Carolina have proposed a law, named for Samantha Josephson, that would require it in all such vehicles.</p>\n<p><em>[READ MORE: </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/uber-safety-tips.html\"><em>Taking Uber?

Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com.\n\u201cIt has to be automatic, like putting on a seatbelt. You have to ask, \u2018What\u2019s my name?\u2019\u201d\nMarci Josephson, whose daughter Samantha was found murdered hours after she got into a car that she mistook for her Uber\n#WhatsMyName.\nThat hashtag has been gaining ground on Twitter, part of a safety campaign started by University of South Carolina students, who are grappling with the murder of a fellow student. They\u2019re imploring riders of Uber and Lyft to ask their drivers, \u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d before getting into a vehicle.\nThe effort is in response to the death of Samantha Josephson, 21, who apparently got into a car she believed was her Uber in a busy downtown area of Columbia, S.C., late last month. Her body was found in the woods 70 miles away, and a 24-year-old man was quickly arrested on charges of kidnapping and murder.\nOn Monday, Josephson\u2019s parents introduced the website Whatsmyname.org to \u201ceducate the world on ride-share safety and the simple precautions one can take to ensure no other family has to suffer this unspeakable tragedy.\u201d\nA week after the attack, three women who say they were raped by men posing as Uber drivers filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing app, claiming that Uber knew fake drivers were targeting women but did not warn its customers.\n[READ MORE: They Thought It Was Their Uber. But the Driver Was a Predator.]\nAcross the country, at least two dozen women have been attacked in recent years after making a mistake similar to Josephson\u2019s. (In Connecticut, a man was recently arraigned on charges that he kidnapped and raped two women who thought he was their driver. In Chicago, prosecutors said a man who posed as an Uber driver sexually assaulted five women.) And a 2018 CNN report found that 103 Uber drivers and 18 Lyft drivers had been accused of sexual assault or abuse.\nUber and Lyft have been criticized for not sufficiently evaluating their drivers and not prioritizing passenger safety, prompting some cities to place temporary bans or restrictions on the services. Both companies say passenger safety is their top priority and have stood by their background-check processes.\nAfter the attack on Josephson, Uber re-upped its public safety awareness campaign called \u201cCheck Your Ride,\u201d first introduced in 2017, urging users to take certain precautions: Match the license plate, car make and model to what the app displays, and check the driver\u2019s photograph before getting in.\nOf course, as critics put it: The onus should not be on women to vigilantly create safe spaces for themselves \u2014 and yet often it is.\nHere are a few safety tips I always abide by.\n______\nAsk the driver\u2019s name.\nIn addition to asking the driver for your name, ask your driver for his or her name and look closely to make sure the photo on the app matches. If the driver\u2019s phone is mounted on the dashboard, look to see if it\u2019s displaying your name.\n______\nShare your status.\nShare your trip details with friends through the sharing option on the app. By adding your destination and sharing through a text, others can watch your ride, in real time, on a map. Uber and Via monitor drivers\u2019 routes, sending alerts to their staff if the cars go off course.\n______\nMatch the light.\nSome Uber and Lyft vehicles have illuminated windshield icons called Beacon and Amp that change color to match a hue on a passenger\u2019s app. If this is available to you, make sure the color matches. Lawmakers in South Carolina have proposed a law, named for Samantha Josephson, that would require it in all such vehicles.\n[READ MORE: Taking Uber?

The other two &mdash; Dr. Matthew Porteus, a genetics researcher, and Dr. William Hurlbut, an ethicist &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/health/gene-editing-babies-crispr.html\">had previously said they strongly discouraged Dr. He</a> when he told them of his idea to create genetically engineered babies.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2019/04/16/stanford-statement-fact-finding-review-related-dr-jiankui/\">a statement</a> Tuesday, Stanford, which has never publicly named the professors under review, said that it had exonerated all of them.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Based on all of the available information, the reviewers found that the Stanford researchers were not participants in Dr. He&rsquo;s research regarding genome editing of human embryos for intended implantation and birth, and that they had no research, financial or organizational ties to this research,&rdquo; the statement said. &ldquo;The review found that the Stanford researchers expressed serious concerns to Dr. He about his work.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Since Dr. He announced the birth of the gene-edited twins in November, the research community has been debating what actions scientists should take if they know about ethically questionable experiments. Global institutions, including the World Health Organization, are working to establish an international reporting and monitoring system.</p>\n<p>Dr. Quake&rsquo;s interactions with Dr. He were detailed in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/health/gene-editing-babies.html\">a recent New York Times article</a>, which included excerpts from emails that Dr. Quake showed to a Times reporter.</p>\n<p>The emails show that Dr. He, 35, who had been a postdoctoral student in Dr. Quake&rsquo;s lab in 2011, kept Dr. Quake apprised of major steps, including the implantation of the edited embryos in the woman&rsquo;s womb and the birth of the twins months later. They show that Dr. Quake suggested that Dr. He obtain ethical approval from Chinese institutions and submit the project&rsquo;s data for vetting by peer-reviewed journals.</p>\n<p>The emails contain encouraging expressions like &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s quite an achievement!&rdquo; But the correspondence makes it clear that Dr. Quake did not participate in the work itself.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Dr. Quake, who turned 50 this week, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased this inquiry is over and its conclusion is consistent with what I knew to be true: that I had urged Dr. He not to pursue this path and when it became clear he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me, to adhere to high scientific and ethical standards in his research.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dr. Quake, an entrepreneur whose inventions include blood tests to detect Down syndrome in pregnancy and to avoid organ transplant rejection, is also co-president of an institute funded by the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan.</p>\n<p>The investigation of Dr. Quake began after the president of Dr. He&rsquo;s Chinese university wrote letters alleging that Dr. Quake had helped with the project.</p>\n<p>The letters, obtained by The Times, claimed that &ldquo;Prof. Stephen Quake provided instructions to the preparation and implementation of the experiment, the publication of papers, the promotion and news release, and the strategies to react after the news release.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Chinese government, in a preliminary report in January, concluded that Dr. He forged ethical review documents and engaged in actions that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/world/asia/china-gene-editing-babies-he-jiankui.html?module=inline\">&ldquo;seriously violated ethics, scientific research integrity and relevant state regulations.&rdquo;</a></p>",

The other two \u2014 Dr. Matthew Porteus, a genetics researcher, and Dr. William Hurlbut, an ethicist \u2014 had previously said they strongly discouraged Dr. He when he told them of his idea to create genetically engineered babies.\nIn a statement Tuesday, Stanford, which has never publicly named the professors under review, said that it had exonerated all of them.\n\u201cBased on all of the available information, the reviewers found that the Stanford researchers were not participants in Dr. He\u2019s research regarding genome editing of human embryos for intended implantation and birth, and that they had no research, financial or organizational ties to this research,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe review found that the Stanford researchers expressed serious concerns to Dr. He about his work.\u201d\nSince Dr. He announced the birth of the gene-edited twins in November, the research community has been debating what actions scientists should take if they know about ethically questionable experiments. Global institutions, including the World Health Organization, are working to establish an international reporting and monitoring system.\nDr. Quake\u2019s interactions with Dr. He were detailed in a recent New York Times article, which included excerpts from emails that Dr. Quake showed to a Times reporter.\nThe emails show that Dr. He, 35, who had been a postdoctoral student in Dr. Quake\u2019s lab in 2011, kept Dr. Quake apprised of major steps, including the implantation of the edited embryos in the woman\u2019s womb and the birth of the twins months later. They show that Dr. Quake suggested that Dr. He obtain ethical approval from Chinese institutions and submit the project\u2019s data for vetting by peer-reviewed journals.\nThe emails contain encouraging expressions like \u201cWow, that\u2019s quite an achievement!\u201d But the correspondence makes it clear that Dr. Quake did not participate in the work itself.\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Quake, who turned 50 this week, said: \u201cI\u2019m pleased this inquiry is over and its conclusion is consistent with what I knew to be true: that I had urged Dr. He not to pursue this path and when it became clear he wouldn\u2019t listen to me, to adhere to high scientific and ethical standards in his research.\u201d\nDr. Quake, an entrepreneur whose inventions include blood tests to detect Down syndrome in pregnancy and to avoid organ transplant rejection, is also co-president of an institute funded by the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan.\nThe investigation of Dr. Quake began after the president of Dr. He\u2019s Chinese university wrote letters alleging that Dr. Quake had helped with the project.\nThe letters, obtained by The Times, claimed that \u201cProf. Stephen Quake provided instructions to the preparation and implementation of the experiment, the publication of papers, the promotion and news release, and the strategies to react after the news release.\u201d\nThe Chinese government, in a preliminary report in January, concluded that Dr. He forged ethical review documents and engaged in actions that \u201cseriously violated ethics, scientific research integrity and relevant state regulations.\u201d",

Mr. al-Nashiri, a Saudi, is accused of being the architect of Al Qaeda&rsquo;s suicide bombing of the Navy destroyer Cole off Yemen on Oct. 12, 2000. Seventeen American sailors died, and dozens more were wounded.</p>\n<p>But more than seven years after Mr. al-Nashiri&rsquo;s arraignment, the case is still in pretrial hearings to determine what law and evidence would apply at a capital trial by the military commission. The decision means a new military judge will have to revisit defense challenges to the charges, what evidence prosecutors must provide Mr. al-Nashiri&rsquo;s lawyers and fundamental constitutional questions about the legality of the military commission system.</p>\n<p>The crux of the issue confronting the appeals court was whether the judge, the now-retired Air Force Col. Vance Spath, was wrong not to disclose that he had applied for and obtained an immigration court job with the Justice Department while sitting on the case, which was being jointly prosecuted by Justice and Defense Department lawyers.</p>\n<p>The three-judge panel found that he was and threw out all of Colonel Spath&rsquo;s decisions from November 2015 to February 2018, when the judge suspended the case pending higher court review. His Justice Department job offer was still secret at the time.</p>\n<p>Judge David Tatel wrote in the appeals court&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/773-appeals-court-vacates-USSCole-case-judge-rulings/f4173e7abbaa2b13bb51/optimized/full.pdf#page=1\">31-page opinion</a> that the court recognized &ldquo;the burden&rdquo; that the decision &ldquo;will place on the government, the public, and al-Nashiri himself.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Despite these costs, however, we cannot permit an appearance of partiality to infect a system of justice that requires the most scrupulous conduct from its adjudicators,&rdquo; Judge Tatel said.</p>\n<p>Ron Flesvig, a spokesman for the military commissions, said on Tuesday that prosecutors had no immediate comment on whether they would seek a review by the full appeals court of the question or challenge the decision at the Supreme Court, developments that could even further delay the start of the death-penalty trial. Colonel Spath did not respond to a message left seeking a comment at his <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/eoir/eoir-immigration-court-listing#VA\">Arlington, Va., immigration court office</a>.</p>\n<p>Capt. Brian Mizer, a defense lawyer for Mr. al-Nashiri, said based on the latest development it would be nearly impossible to predict when the case would come to trial.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I would hate to hazard a guess,&rdquo; Captain Mizer said. &ldquo;Eleven years of litigation to get where we are now would suggest Mr. al-Nashiri&rsquo;s trial defense team may be in high school right now. Which is a tragedy for everyone involved.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A survivor of the Cole bombing, retired Navy Senior Chief Joe Pelly, said he was &ldquo;kind of shocked&rdquo; by the decision. He added that he was particularly disappointed for &ldquo;the parents of the children that were killed,&rdquo; a reference to the young sailors who were killed in the bombing, which struck the ship&rsquo;s galley for enlisted sailors.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I just believe that we, the Cole survivors, and the Gold Star family members have just been a pawn in this whole process,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But hopefully our time shall come that we can move forward in this case.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Captain Mizer, a Navy reservist, was returned to the case last year at Colonel Spath&rsquo;s request. All of Mr. al-Nashiri&rsquo;s civilian counsel quit the case in October 2017 in an ethics dispute with the judge.</p>\n<p>His civilian lawyers had found a microphone hidden in the wall of their meeting room at the United States Navy base prison, but Colonel Spath prohibited them from investigating its purpose or telling their client about it as a potential violation of attorney-client confidentiality because the information was classified. Prosecutors eventually disclosed the discovery in a court filing that called the microphone a &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; listening device, and said nobody eavesdropped on the team.</p>\n<p>The three-judge panel faulted Colonel Spath, case prosecutors and a Pentagon appeals panel called the United States Court of Military Commission Review. &ldquo;Criminal justice is a shared responsibility,&rdquo; the panel wrote, adding that in this case, only Mr. al-Nashiri&rsquo;s defense team had shouldered it.</p>\n<p>First, the judge failed to disclose his job pursuit. Later, prosecutors rejected a request by Mr. al-Nashiri&rsquo;s lawyers for information about Colonel Spath&rsquo;s quest to find a civilian job before retirement, and the Pentagon panel agreed that defense lawyers were not entitled to it.</p>\n<p>That information emerged through a <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article221922035.ece/binary/The%20complete%20FOIA%20package\">Freedom of Information Act</a> request for Colonel Spath&rsquo;s immigration court application and supporting materials filed by the news organization McClatchy. Defense lawyers appended it to their appeal.</p>\n<p>The court found it &ldquo;especially troubling&rdquo; that Colonel Spath issued most of his classified rulings in the national-security case &ldquo;in a flurry&rdquo; after Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, agreed to his appointment to be an immigration judge in March 2017.</p>\n<p>At military commissions, prosecutors can present the judge directly with classified information and get permission to use a substitute for original evidence, citing the need to protect national security.</p>\n<p>To undo those secret substitutions, the appeals court turned the clock back.</p>\n<p>Once back on track, a new judge will have to reconsider Colonel Spath&rsquo;s invalidated decisions and revisit a prosecution request to pre-admit hundreds of pieces of physical evidence F.B.I. agents tagged from the wreck of the ship in Aden, Yemen, as well as several safe houses in Aden. In both instances, hearing testimony showed, sailors on the heavily damaged destroyer and Yemeni police or intelligence agents got to the evidence first.</p>\n<p>Also apparently thrown out was a closed-court deposition Colonel Spath took at Guant&aacute;namo Bay from a confessed Qaeda terrorist. Ahmed Muhammed Haza al-Darbi testified against Mr. al-Nashiri before being <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/us/politics/guantanamo-detainee-transferred-trump-al-darbi.html\">repatriated in May</a> to serve a prison sentence his native Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>It was unclear how far-ranging the effects of the Cole case decision would be.</p>\n<p>But a defense lawyer in the Sept. 11 capital case, James Connell, said on Tuesday that he would renew an objection to that case&rsquo;s trial judge, Col. Keith Parrella of the Marines, because the colonel had done a 2014-15 fellowship as an on-loan prosecutor at the counterterrorism section of the Justice Department&rsquo;s National Security Division.</p>\n<p>They had argued that the colonel&rsquo;s earlier role presented a particular ethical conflict because four of the nine prosecutors on the Sept. 11 case work for the same unit.</p>\n<p>Government lawyers defending Colonel Spath&rsquo;s decisions had argued that the Executive Office for Immigration Review was a far-removed division of the Justice Department, so the colonel had no obligation to disclose his job pursuit.</p>\n<p>The appeals panel, however, found that &ldquo;the attorney general was a participant in al-Nashiri&rsquo;s case from start to finish: He has consulted on commission trial procedures, he has lent out one of his lawyers and he will play a role in defending any conviction on appeal.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Hasan Jamali/Associated Press\nThis article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\nGUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 A federal appeals court on Tuesday threw out more than two years of a military tribunal judge\u2019s decisions in the case of the man accused of plotting the bombing of the destroyer Cole, finding that the jurist wrongly hid his pursuit of an immigration judge job while sitting on the war crimes case.\nThe decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was a major setback in the oldest death-penalty case at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and yet another twist in a winding and fraught case that has come to symbolize the government\u2019s difficulties in pursuing prosecutions of detainees through the military tribunal system.\nAbd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, 54, who has been in American custody since 2002, has been represented by military commission defense lawyers since 2008 and was formally charged in 2011. Mr. al-Nashiri, a Saudi, is accused of being the architect of Al Qaeda\u2019s suicide bombing of the Navy destroyer Cole off Yemen on Oct. 12, 2000. Seventeen American sailors died, and dozens more were wounded.\nBut more than seven years after Mr. al-Nashiri\u2019s arraignment, the case is still in pretrial hearings to determine what law and evidence would apply at a capital trial by the military commission. The decision means a new military judge will have to revisit defense challenges to the charges, what evidence prosecutors must provide Mr. al-Nashiri\u2019s lawyers and fundamental constitutional questions about the legality of the military commission system.\nThe crux of the issue confronting the appeals court was whether the judge, the now-retired Air Force Col. Vance Spath, was wrong not to disclose that he had applied for and obtained an immigration court job with the Justice Department while sitting on the case, which was being jointly prosecuted by Justice and Defense Department lawyers.\nThe three-judge panel found that he was and threw out all of Colonel Spath\u2019s decisions from November 2015 to February 2018, when the judge suspended the case pending higher court review. His Justice Department job offer was still secret at the time.\nJudge David Tatel wrote in the appeals court\u2019s 31-page opinion that the court recognized \u201cthe burden\u201d that the decision \u201cwill place on the government, the public, and al-Nashiri himself.\u201d\n\u201cDespite these costs, however, we cannot permit an appearance of partiality to infect a system of justice that requires the most scrupulous conduct from its adjudicators,\u201d Judge Tatel said.\nRon Flesvig, a spokesman for the military commissions, said on Tuesday that prosecutors had no immediate comment on whether they would seek a review by the full appeals court of the question or challenge the decision at the Supreme Court, developments that could even further delay the start of the death-penalty trial. Colonel Spath did not respond to a message left seeking a comment at his Arlington, Va., immigration court office.\nCapt. Brian Mizer, a defense lawyer for Mr. al-Nashiri, said based on the latest development it would be nearly impossible to predict when the case would come to trial.\n\u201cI would hate to hazard a guess,\u201d Captain Mizer said. \u201cEleven years of litigation to get where we are now would suggest Mr. al-Nashiri\u2019s trial defense team may be in high school right now. Which is a tragedy for everyone involved.\u201d\nA survivor of the Cole bombing, retired Navy Senior Chief Joe Pelly, said he was \u201ckind of shocked\u201d by the decision. He added that he was particularly disappointed for \u201cthe parents of the children that were killed,\u201d a reference to the young sailors who were killed in the bombing, which struck the ship\u2019s galley for enlisted sailors.\n\u201cI just believe that we, the Cole survivors, and the Gold Star family members have just been a pawn in this whole process,\u201d he said. \u201cBut hopefully our time shall come that we can move forward in this case.\u201d\nCaptain Mizer, a Navy reservist, was returned to the case last year at Colonel Spath\u2019s request. All of Mr. al-Nashiri\u2019s civilian counsel quit the case in October 2017 in an ethics dispute with the judge.\nHis civilian lawyers had found a microphone hidden in the wall of their meeting room at the United States Navy base prison, but Colonel Spath prohibited them from investigating its purpose or telling their client about it as a potential violation of attorney-client confidentiality because the information was classified. Prosecutors eventually disclosed the discovery in a court filing that called the microphone a \u201clegacy\u201d listening device, and said nobody eavesdropped on the team.\nThe three-judge panel faulted Colonel Spath, case prosecutors and a Pentagon appeals panel called the United States Court of Military Commission Review. \u201cCriminal justice is a shared responsibility,\u201d the panel wrote, adding that in this case, only Mr. al-Nashiri\u2019s defense team had shouldered it.\nFirst, the judge failed to disclose his job pursuit. Later, prosecutors rejected a request by Mr. al-Nashiri\u2019s lawyers for information about Colonel Spath\u2019s quest to find a civilian job before retirement, and the Pentagon panel agreed that defense lawyers were not entitled to it.\nThat information emerged through a Freedom of Information Act request for Colonel Spath\u2019s immigration court application and supporting materials filed by the news organization McClatchy. Defense lawyers appended it to their appeal.\nThe court found it \u201cespecially troubling\u201d that Colonel Spath issued most of his classified rulings in the national-security case \u201cin a flurry\u201d after Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, agreed to his appointment to be an immigration judge in March 2017.\nAt military commissions, prosecutors can present the judge directly with classified information and get permission to use a substitute for original evidence, citing the need to protect national security.\nTo undo those secret substitutions, the appeals court turned the clock back.\nOnce back on track, a new judge will have to reconsider Colonel Spath\u2019s invalidated decisions and revisit a prosecution request to pre-admit hundreds of pieces of physical evidence F.B.I. agents tagged from the wreck of the ship in Aden, Yemen, as well as several safe houses in Aden. In both instances, hearing testimony showed, sailors on the heavily damaged destroyer and Yemeni police or intelligence agents got to the evidence first.\nAlso apparently thrown out was a closed-court deposition Colonel Spath took at Guant\u00e1namo Bay from a confessed Qaeda terrorist. Ahmed Muhammed Haza al-Darbi testified against Mr. al-Nashiri before being repatriated in May to serve a prison sentence his native Saudi Arabia.\nIt was unclear how far-ranging the effects of the Cole case decision would be.\nBut a defense lawyer in the Sept. 11 capital case, James Connell, said on Tuesday that he would renew an objection to that case\u2019s trial judge, Col. Keith Parrella of the Marines, because the colonel had done a 2014-15 fellowship as an on-loan prosecutor at the counterterrorism section of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.\nThey had argued that the colonel\u2019s earlier role presented a particular ethical conflict because four of the nine prosecutors on the Sept. 11 case work for the same unit.\nGovernment lawyers defending Colonel Spath\u2019s decisions had argued that the Executive Office for Immigration Review was a far-removed division of the Justice Department, so the colonel had no obligation to disclose his job pursuit.\nThe appeals panel, however, found that \u201cthe attorney general was a participant in al-Nashiri\u2019s case from start to finish: He has consulted on commission trial procedures, he has lent out one of his lawyers and he will play a role in defending any conviction on appeal.\u201d",

That struggle has especially been apparent in the House, where Jewish Democrats have tangled with Ms. Omar and Democratic leaders have grappled with how to handle the freshman Democrat from Minnesota, who is one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress.</p>\n<p>When Ms. Omar, 36, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/us/politics/ilhan-omar-minnesota-congress.html\">pushed for a House rules</a> change to permit her to wear her hijab on the House floor, she was heralded as a powerful symbol of the Democratic Party&rsquo;s inclusiveness. But her support of the boycott Israel movement and her attacks on supporters of Israel have made her a complicated figure to defend. Democratic leaders, as well as many in the rank and file, are choosing their words with caution.</p>\n<p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced the president for invoking the &ldquo;painful images of 9/11 for a political attack&rdquo; without mentioning Ms. Omar, and waited until Sunday &mdash; two days after Mr. Trump&rsquo;s tweet &mdash; to issue a statement saying she had asked the Capitol Police to assess the congresswoman&rsquo;s safety. Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the House Democratic leader, waited three days before calling on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaderHoyer/status/1117767898141995009\">president to apologize</a> to Ms. Omar.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/world/middleeast/trump-israel-omar-tlaib.html\">Representative Rashida Tlaib</a>, Democrat of Michigan and the only other Muslim woman in Congress, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RashidaTlaib/status/1117126415357497344\">wrote on Twitter</a>, responding to someone who complained about Ms. Omar&rsquo;s &ldquo;lack of support&rdquo; from the Democratic leadership. &ldquo;However, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for &amp; why we ran in the first place, we are ignored. To truly honor our diversity is to never silence us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In many respects, Ms. Omar, a Somali refugee whose family received asylum in the United States when she was a teenager, represents a new direction for the Democratic Party. Her allies on the left argue that Mr. Trump&rsquo;s war with Ms. Omar is a defining issue for the party.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is a proxy for who counts as an American and who doesn&rsquo;t, and that is a fight that the Democratic Party needs to be leading on,&rdquo; said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, a liberal advocacy group that helped elect Ms. Omar. &ldquo;The Democratic Party can&rsquo;t run away from the fight regarding Ilhan Omar, because she represents the country. In the story between Make America Great Again or the new America we are becoming, she is a pivotal character.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump appears to agree. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/us/politics/trump-ilhan-omar.html\">Using Ms. Omar as his foil</a>, he and his team are deploying the same anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim messaging for the 2020 re-election campaign that they used to ride to the White House in 2016. The congresswoman has said she has &ldquo;experienced an increase in direct threats on my life&rdquo; since the president&rsquo;s tweet on Friday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is endangering lives,&rdquo; she said in a statement on Sunday night. &ldquo;It has to stop.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But centrist Democrats have a more complex relationship with Ms. Omar. Her leftist brand of politics does not go over well in the swing districts that delivered Democrats the House majority. Her views on Israel make many Jews &mdash; an important component of the Democratic base &mdash; deeply uneasy. And her insinuations that American policy toward the Jewish state is driven by money &mdash; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the Benjamins baby,&rdquo; she wrote on Twitter &mdash; have drawn charges of anti-Semitism, prompting <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/us/politics/ilhan-omar-anti-semitism.html\">her to apologize.</a></p>\n<p>So while Ms. Omar&rsquo;s more moderate colleagues have denounced the threats against her, they have been tepid in their remarks. Representative Josh Gottheimer, a centrist Democrat from New Jersey and strong supporter of Israel, spoke carefully when asked about Ms. Omar.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The response to different points of view in our country must never be threats of physical harm or violence,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>But if the party is conflicted about Ms. Omar, it is not reflected in the fund-raising report she filed this week with the Federal Election Commission.</p>\n<p>During the first quarter of 2019, she raised $832,000, roughly half of which was from donors giving under $200. Over all, Ms. Omar took in nearly twice the median amount raised by incumbents who are in races rated a tossup by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, according to Michael Beckel, who analyzes money in politics for Issue One, a bipartisan group that advocates election overhaul.</p>\n<p>The current controversy around Ms. Omar stems from remarks she made to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, describing how the group was founded after the Sept. 11 attacks &ldquo;because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.&rdquo; (The group was actually founded in 1994.)</p>\n<p>Last Tuesday, Representative Daniel Crenshaw, a freshman Republican from Texas, seized on the &ldquo;some people did something&rdquo; phrase, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dancrenshawtx/status/1115672008082305026\">posted a tweet</a> suggesting Ms. Omar was minimizing the attacks. Conservative news outlets &mdash; including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_waleedshahid/status/1116314806200479745\">The New York Post</a> and Fox&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fox &amp; Friends,&rdquo; Mr. Trump&rsquo;s favorite television program &mdash; picked up on it. On Friday, Mr. Trump tweeted the edited video, which interspersed graphic images of the burning World Trade Center towers with a clip from Ms. Omar&rsquo;s speech.</p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/16/politics/pelosi-omar-trump-no-anti-semitism/index.html\">interview on Tuesday with CNN</a>, Ms. Pelosi rejected the notion that Ms. Omar was anti-Semitic, and expressed concern for her well being, but she said she had not spoken to the congresswoman about the CAIR speech. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what was said,&rdquo; Ms. Pelosi said. &ldquo;But I do know what the president did was not right.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Democratic presidential candidates <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/us/politics/trump-ilhan-omar-911.html\">have had their own complicated reactions</a>. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, has cast herself as a progressive on the campaign trail. But she qualified her support for Ms. Omar, by saying, &ldquo;As a senator who represents 9/11 victims, I can&rsquo;t accept any minimizing of that pain.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Even Mr. Sanders, who hails from the same liberal wing of the party as Ms. Omar &mdash; and would be the country&rsquo;s first Jewish president if elected &mdash; offered a mixed response. Speaking at a town hall-style meeting televised by the Fox News Channel on Monday night, he said he respected Ms. Omar. And while he said he does not believe she is anti-Semitic, he added, &ldquo;I think Ilhan has got to do a better job in speaking to the Jewish community.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Omar&rsquo;s supporters say there is a danger to the Democratic split.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Some of these institutional Democratic leaders can&rsquo;t find, frankly, the spine to speak up quickly and strongly in defense of one of their colleagues,&rdquo; said Zahra Billoo, a spokeswoman for CAIR. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t find alignment soon, knowing that Donald Trump is already passing Democratic candidates in his own fund-raising, I worry that we are looking at a second term because the leaders of our party did not do the right thing.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump tweeted an edited video portraying Representative Ilhan Omar as playing down the 9/11 attacks, it took less than three hours for Senator Bernie Sanders to rush to her defense and declare her \u201ca leader with strength and courage.\u201d But when a Fox News anchor described Mr. Sanders on Monday night as \u201ca staunch supporter\u201d of Ms. Omar, the senator balked.\n\u201cHold it, hold it, hold it,\u201d Mr. Sanders insisted. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to Ilhan about twice in my life.\u201d\nHis reaction reflects the broader Democratic Party\u2019s conflicted embrace of Ms. Omar. That struggle has especially been apparent in the House, where Jewish Democrats have tangled with Ms. Omar and Democratic leaders have grappled with how to handle the freshman Democrat from Minnesota, who is one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress.\nWhen Ms. Omar, 36, pushed for a House rules change to permit her to wear her hijab on the House floor, she was heralded as a powerful symbol of the Democratic Party\u2019s inclusiveness. But her support of the boycott Israel movement and her attacks on supporters of Israel have made her a complicated figure to defend. Democratic leaders, as well as many in the rank and file, are choosing their words with caution.\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi denounced the president for invoking the \u201cpainful images of 9/11 for a political attack\u201d without mentioning Ms. Omar, and waited until Sunday \u2014 two days after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet \u2014 to issue a statement saying she had asked the Capitol Police to assess the congresswoman\u2019s safety. Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the House Democratic leader, waited three days before calling on the president to apologize to Ms. Omar.\n\u201cThey put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse,\u201d Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan and the only other Muslim woman in Congress, wrote on Twitter, responding to someone who complained about Ms. Omar\u2019s \u201clack of support\u201d from the Democratic leadership. \u201cHowever, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for & why we ran in the first place, we are ignored. To truly honor our diversity is to never silence us.\u201d\nIn many respects, Ms. Omar, a Somali refugee whose family received asylum in the United States when she was a teenager, represents a new direction for the Democratic Party. Her allies on the left argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s war with Ms. Omar is a defining issue for the party.\n\u201cThis is a proxy for who counts as an American and who doesn\u2019t, and that is a fight that the Democratic Party needs to be leading on,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, a liberal advocacy group that helped elect Ms. Omar. \u201cThe Democratic Party can\u2019t run away from the fight regarding Ilhan Omar, because she represents the country. In the story between Make America Great Again or the new America we are becoming, she is a pivotal character.\u201d\nMr. Trump appears to agree. Using Ms. Omar as his foil, he and his team are deploying the same anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim messaging for the 2020 re-election campaign that they used to ride to the White House in 2016. The congresswoman has said she has \u201cexperienced an increase in direct threats on my life\u201d since the president\u2019s tweet on Friday.\n\u201cThis is endangering lives,\u201d she said in a statement on Sunday night. \u201cIt has to stop.\u201d\nBut centrist Democrats have a more complex relationship with Ms. Omar. Her leftist brand of politics does not go over well in the swing districts that delivered Democrats the House majority. Her views on Israel make many Jews \u2014 an important component of the Democratic base \u2014 deeply uneasy. And her insinuations that American policy toward the Jewish state is driven by money \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins baby,\u201d she wrote on Twitter \u2014 have drawn charges of anti-Semitism, prompting her to apologize.\nSo while Ms. Omar\u2019s more moderate colleagues have denounced the threats against her, they have been tepid in their remarks. Representative Josh Gottheimer, a centrist Democrat from New Jersey and strong supporter of Israel, spoke carefully when asked about Ms. Omar.\n\u201cThe response to different points of view in our country must never be threats of physical harm or violence,\u201d he said.\nBut if the party is conflicted about Ms. Omar, it is not reflected in the fund-raising report she filed this week with the Federal Election Commission.\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, she raised $832,000, roughly half of which was from donors giving under $200. Over all, Ms. Omar took in nearly twice the median amount raised by incumbents who are in races rated a tossup by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, according to Michael Beckel, who analyzes money in politics for Issue One, a bipartisan group that advocates election overhaul.\nThe current controversy around Ms. Omar stems from remarks she made to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, describing how the group was founded after the Sept. 11 attacks \u201cbecause they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\u201d (The group was actually founded in 1994.)\nLast Tuesday, Representative Daniel Crenshaw, a freshman Republican from Texas, seized on the \u201csome people did something\u201d phrase, and posted a tweet suggesting Ms. Omar was minimizing the attacks. Conservative news outlets \u2014 including The New York Post and Fox\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite television program \u2014 picked up on it. On Friday, Mr. Trump tweeted the edited video, which interspersed graphic images of the burning World Trade Center towers with a clip from Ms. Omar\u2019s speech.\nIn an interview on Tuesday with CNN, Ms. Pelosi rejected the notion that Ms. Omar was anti-Semitic, and expressed concern for her well being, but she said she had not spoken to the congresswoman about the CAIR speech. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what was said,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cBut I do know what the president did was not right.\u201d\nDemocratic presidential candidates have had their own complicated reactions. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, has cast herself as a progressive on the campaign trail. But she qualified her support for Ms. Omar, by saying, \u201cAs a senator who represents 9/11 victims, I can\u2019t accept any minimizing of that pain.\u201d\nEven Mr. Sanders, who hails from the same liberal wing of the party as Ms. Omar \u2014 and would be the country\u2019s first Jewish president if elected \u2014 offered a mixed response. Speaking at a town hall-style meeting televised by the Fox News Channel on Monday night, he said he respected Ms. Omar. And while he said he does not believe she is anti-Semitic, he added, \u201cI think Ilhan has got to do a better job in speaking to the Jewish community.\u201d\nMs. Omar\u2019s supporters say there is a danger to the Democratic split.\n\u201cSome of these institutional Democratic leaders can\u2019t find, frankly, the spine to speak up quickly and strongly in defense of one of their colleagues,\u201d said Zahra Billoo, a spokeswoman for CAIR. \u201cIf we don\u2019t find alignment soon, knowing that Donald Trump is already passing Democratic candidates in his own fund-raising, I worry that we are looking at a second term because the leaders of our party did not do the right thing.\u201d",

It was opposed by several of the president&rsquo;s top advisers, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, according to people who spoke with White House officials.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,&rdquo; Mr. Trump said in his veto message.</p>\n<p>The veto came only a month after Mr. Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/us/politics/trump-veto-national-emergency.html\">similarly rejected a bipartisan measure</a> that would have overturned his declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border. Congress failed to override that veto and appears similarly unlikely to muster the votes to override the Yemen veto.</p>\n<p>Supporters of this resolution had higher hopes that Mr. Trump might sign it. Although it went against a key ally, Saudi Arabia, it played to his longstanding opposition to American involvement in foreign wars. This was the first time War Powers legislation passed Congress with bipartisan support and reached a president&rsquo;s desk.</p>\n<p>But the rebuke of Saudi Arabia and the perceived threat to Mr. Trump&rsquo;s executive powers played a bigger role in his decision.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is deeply disappointing,&rdquo; said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who was one of the original sponsors of the measure in the House and had sought a meeting with Mr. Trump to try to persuade him to sign it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The president had the opportunity to sign a historic War Powers Resolution and stand with a bipartisan coalition, including his allies Rand Paul, Mark Meadows and Matt Gaetz, to stop endless wars,&rdquo; Mr. Khanna said. &ldquo;He failed to uphold the principles of the Constitution that give Congress power over matters of war and peace.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Khanna was referring to the Republican senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul, and two Republican representatives, from North Carolina and Florida, Mr. Meadows and Mr. Gaetz, who are closely aligned with Mr. Trump, but split with fellow Republicans to vote with Democrats in favor of the resolution. Members of the group had asked to meet with Mr. Trump to make their case against a veto, but the White House brushed them off.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump has spoken out for years against American military entanglements, whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria. He has clashed with his generals over the timetable for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and Syria.</p>\n<p>In his veto message, Mr. Trump said he agreed with Congress that &ldquo;great nations do not fight endless wars.&rdquo; He noted that the United States was negotiating to end its involvement in Afghanistan and drawing down troops in Syria, after what he said was the conquest of 100 percent of the territory once held by the Islamic State.</p>\n<p>Yemen, however, is a different situation, he declared. The United States provides logistical support to the Saudi-led coalition against the Houthi rebels. It stopped its most direct military involvement: in-flight refueling of Saudi planes. And Saudi Arabia remains a staunch ally of the United States, the linchpin of its campaign to isolate Iran, which supports the Houthis in their uprising against the Yemeni government.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We cannot end the conflict in Yemen through political documents,&rdquo; Mr. Trump said. &ldquo;Peace in Yemen requires a negotiated settlement.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s allies in the war praised Mr. Trump, insisting that they continued to work for a settlement through the United Nations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;President Trump&rsquo;s assertion of support to the Arab Coalition in Yemen is a positive signal of US resolve towards America&rsquo;s allies,&rdquo; the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, Anwar Gargash, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnwarGargash/status/1118309520713945089\">said in a post on Twitter</a>. &ldquo;Common strategic interests are best served with this clear commitment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Critics, however, said Mr. Trump&rsquo;s veto amounted to a &ldquo;green light&rdquo; for continued atrocities in Yemen, where human rights groups said there were already 10 million people on the brink of famine and as many as 100 civilian casualties a week.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This veto by President Trump is morally wrong and strategically wrongheaded,&rdquo; said David Miliband, the president of the International Rescue Committee. &ldquo;It sets back the hopes for respite for the Yemeni people, and leaves the U.S. upholding a failed strategy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia and an advocate for congressional prerogative on matters of war, said the veto was &ldquo;part of an alarming pattern of Trump turning a blind eye to Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s actions that fly in the face of American values, like the murder of journalist and Virginia resident Jamal Khashoggi and the jailing of women&rsquo;s right activists.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump spoke by phone last week with Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, whom intelligence officials believe ordered the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/cia-saudi-crown-prince-khashoggi.html\">killing of Mr. Khashoggi</a> in October in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Mr. Trump has not accepted that assessment, saying the prince&rsquo;s role in the killing was not clear.</p>\n<p>Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s support will be particularly critical in coming months, if, as expected, the White House finally presents its proposal for a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Mr. Trump&rsquo;s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, has spent months cultivating Arab leaders, chiefly Crown Prince Mohammed, to win their endorsement of the plan, which he has drafted.</p>\n<p>While Republicans like Mr. Paul and Mr. Meadows voted for the resolution, there were limits to how much they lobbied the president. Other Republicans, like Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, argued against the resolution as an attempt to hem in the president.</p>",

                "text": "Hani Mohammed/Associated Press\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump vetoed a bipartisan resolution on Tuesday that would have forced an end to American military involvement in Saudi Arabia\u2019s civil war in Yemen, rejecting an appeal by lawmakers to his own deeply rooted instincts to withdraw the United States from bloody foreign conflicts.\nThe veto, only the second time Mr. Trump has used his power to block legislation passed by both houses of Congress, strikes down a resolution that invoked the War Powers Act to distance the United States from a four-year conflict that has killed thousands of civilians and resulted in a widespread famine.\nThe measure was a rebuke of Mr. Trump\u2019s support for Saudi Arabia even after the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It was opposed by several of the president\u2019s top advisers, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, according to people who spoke with White House officials.\n\u201cThis resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his veto message.\nThe veto came only a month after Mr. Trump similarly rejected a bipartisan measure that would have overturned his declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border. Congress failed to override that veto and appears similarly unlikely to muster the votes to override the Yemen veto.\nSupporters of this resolution had higher hopes that Mr. Trump might sign it. Although it went against a key ally, Saudi Arabia, it played to his longstanding opposition to American involvement in foreign wars. This was the first time War Powers legislation passed Congress with bipartisan support and reached a president\u2019s desk.\nBut the rebuke of Saudi Arabia and the perceived threat to Mr. Trump\u2019s executive powers played a bigger role in his decision.\n\u201cThis is deeply disappointing,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who was one of the original sponsors of the measure in the House and had sought a meeting with Mr. Trump to try to persuade him to sign it.\n\u201cThe president had the opportunity to sign a historic War Powers Resolution and stand with a bipartisan coalition, including his allies Rand Paul, Mark Meadows and Matt Gaetz, to stop endless wars,\u201d Mr. Khanna said. \u201cHe failed to uphold the principles of the Constitution that give Congress power over matters of war and peace.\u201d\nMr. Khanna was referring to the Republican senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul, and two Republican representatives, from North Carolina and Florida, Mr. Meadows and Mr. Gaetz, who are closely aligned with Mr. Trump, but split with fellow Republicans to vote with Democrats in favor of the resolution. Members of the group had asked to meet with Mr. Trump to make their case against a veto, but the White House brushed them off.\nMr. Trump has spoken out for years against American military entanglements, whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria. He has clashed with his generals over the timetable for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and Syria.\nIn his veto message, Mr. Trump said he agreed with Congress that \u201cgreat nations do not fight endless wars.\u201d He noted that the United States was negotiating to end its involvement in Afghanistan and drawing down troops in Syria, after what he said was the conquest of 100 percent of the territory once held by the Islamic State.\nYemen, however, is a different situation, he declared. The United States provides logistical support to the Saudi-led coalition against the Houthi rebels. It stopped its most direct military involvement: in-flight refueling of Saudi planes. And Saudi Arabia remains a staunch ally of the United States, the linchpin of its campaign to isolate Iran, which supports the Houthis in their uprising against the Yemeni government.\n\u201cWe cannot end the conflict in Yemen through political documents,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cPeace in Yemen requires a negotiated settlement.\u201d\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s allies in the war praised Mr. Trump, insisting that they continued to work for a settlement through the United Nations.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s assertion of support to the Arab Coalition in Yemen is a positive signal of US resolve towards America\u2019s allies,\u201d the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, Anwar Gargash, said in a post on Twitter. \u201cCommon strategic interests are best served with this clear commitment.\u201d\nCritics, however, said Mr. Trump\u2019s veto amounted to a \u201cgreen light\u201d for continued atrocities in Yemen, where human rights groups said there were already 10 million people on the brink of famine and as many as 100 civilian casualties a week.\n\u201cThis veto by President Trump is morally wrong and strategically wrongheaded,\u201d said David Miliband, the president of the International Rescue Committee. \u201cIt sets back the hopes for respite for the Yemeni people, and leaves the U.S. upholding a failed strategy.\u201d\nSenator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia and an advocate for congressional prerogative on matters of war, said the veto was \u201cpart of an alarming pattern of Trump turning a blind eye to Saudi Arabia\u2019s actions that fly in the face of American values, like the murder of journalist and Virginia resident Jamal Khashoggi and the jailing of women\u2019s right activists.\u201d\nMr. Trump spoke by phone last week with Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, whom intelligence officials believe ordered the killing of Mr. Khashoggi in October in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Mr. Trump has not accepted that assessment, saying the prince\u2019s role in the killing was not clear.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s support will be particularly critical in coming months, if, as expected, the White House finally presents its proposal for a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, has spent months cultivating Arab leaders, chiefly Crown Prince Mohammed, to win their endorsement of the plan, which he has drafted.\nWhile Republicans like Mr. Paul and Mr. Meadows voted for the resolution, there were limits to how much they lobbied the president. Other Republicans, like Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, argued against the resolution as an attempt to hem in the president.",

House, a former researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who worked as a volunteer for WikiLeaks from 2009 to 2013.</p>\n<p>Mr. House spoke for about 90 minutes to prosecutors and also testified at length to the grand jury, according to a person who has spoken with prosecutors and agreed to an interview on the condition of anonymity. They pressed him for information about debates inside WikiLeaks over whether to redact from government documents posted online the names of vulnerable people, such as foreign citizens who worked confidentially with American military officers or diplomats, to protect them from harm.</p>\n<p>The communications with Mr. Berg and Mr. House show that even after Mr. Assange was indicted on accusations of computer hacking, the United States government was eager to build a case against a WikiLeaks associate for disseminating state secrets &mdash; a charge that spoke directly to the group&rsquo;s main enterprise, but would also thrust the Justice Department into a thorny fight over First Amendment rights and galvanize supporters of WikiLeaks and of the free press.</p>\n<p>They also show that prosecutors were focused mainly on work done by WikiLeaks in 2010, when Mr. Assange received classified and secret information from Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and American diplomacy overseas.</p>\n<p>Mr. Assange worked with reporters at publications including The New York Times, The Guardian and the German magazine Der Spiegel to publish that information. Eric H. Holder Jr., then the attorney general, announced a criminal investigation of WikiLeaks.</p>\n<p>Justice Department officials under the Obama administration ultimately decided they could not prosecute Mr. Assange for sharing information because it risked setting a precedent that could erode press freedoms for news organizations that also publish classified information.</p>\n<p>But prosecutors in Northern Virginia continued to explore ways to crack down on WikiLeaks.</p>\n<p>The letter to Mr. Berg, dated March 7, 2018 &mdash; one day after Mr. Assange <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/754-assange-indictment/d093e7dc7982f7fe4c24/optimized/full.pdf#page=1\">was secretly indicted</a> &mdash; was sent by Tracy Doherty-McCormick, a cybercrime and national security specialist who worked on the Assange case while she was a federal prosecutor in Virginia under the Obama administration. She was also the acting United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia when Mr. Assange was indicted.</p>\n<p>Ms. Doherty-McCormick wrote that the interview would be voluntary, and it was unclear whether Mr. Berg ultimately spoke with prosecutors. The German publication Die Zeit <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de/2019/17/julian-assange-donald-trump-usa-wikileaks\">first reported the case against Mr. Berg</a>.</p>\n<p>A Justice Department spokesman declined to say whether the government had dropped its case against Mr. Berg or whether there were any sealed charges against him or any other WikiLeaks associates.</p>\n<p>In his interviews with prosecutors and the grand jury, Mr. House denied any role in the leak of the documents from Ms. Manning to WikiLeaks, the person said. Mr. House&rsquo;s interview with prosecutors and grand jury testimony were reported earlier by <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/wikileaks-veteran-i-cooperated-with-feds-in-exchange-for-immunity\"> The Daily Beast</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chelsea-manning-subpoenaed-to-testify-before-grand-jury-in-assange-investigation/2019/03/01/fe3bd582-3c32-11e9-a06c-3ec8ed509d15_story.html?utm_term=.192fab562561\">The Washington Post</a>.</p>\n<p>He was asked about online chats among WikiLeaks workers that investigators had obtained and was questioned about discussions inside the group about when to redact names from documents posted on the internet.</p>\n<p>The question of redactions became a point of contention in 2010, after human rights groups criticized WikiLeaks for exposing the names of Afghan citizens who had assisted the United States and might be subject to retaliation. The group subsequently stripped names from many documents but remained inconsistent in its practices.</p>\n<p>It is unclear whether investigators were considering whether endangering people named in the government documents by posting them online might violate a criminal statute.</p>\n<p>Mr. Assange was ultimately accused of unsuccessfully helping Ms. Manning try to log onto a classified military network by breaking a passcode and using another person&rsquo;s identity. He was charged with a single computer hacking offense.</p>\n<p>The indictment against Mr. Assange did not include any charge related to the receipt or publication of secret information, but he was accused of hacking into a government computer system &ldquo;in furtherance of a criminal act&rdquo; that violated laws against obtaining material to harm the United States or to aid a foreign power.</p>\n<p>Nor did the indictment mention the 2016 election or Mr. Assange&rsquo;s decision to post to WikiLeaks troves of Democratic emails stolen by Russian government hackers.</p>\n<p>The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/politics/mueller-indictment-russian-intelligence-hacking.html\">secured an indictment</a> against 12 Russian military officers in the thefts, describing them as part of the Kremlin&rsquo;s campaign to undermine the American electoral process and help Mr. Trump win the election.

                "text": "Andrew Testa for The New York Times\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department continued to investigate WikiLeaks last year even after the secret indictment of its founder, Julian Assange, seeking to question at least two of the antisecrecy organization\u2019s volunteers about their activities, according to interviews and a letter obtained by The New York Times.\nOne day after prosecutors charged Mr. Assange with a single count of conspiracy to unlawfully hack into a computer, the Justice Department asked Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a former WikiLeaks activist, if it could question him about the possibility that he violated American laws prohibiting \u201cthe receipt and dissemination of secret information.\u201d The language, in a letter to him in his native German, suggested that prosecutors had not, at least at that point, abandoned the possibility of charges based on WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of United States government secrets.\nProsecutors last summer also sought out David M. House, a former researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who worked as a volunteer for WikiLeaks from 2009 to 2013.\nMr. House spoke for about 90 minutes to prosecutors and also testified at length to the grand jury, according to a person who has spoken with prosecutors and agreed to an interview on the condition of anonymity. They pressed him for information about debates inside WikiLeaks over whether to redact from government documents posted online the names of vulnerable people, such as foreign citizens who worked confidentially with American military officers or diplomats, to protect them from harm.\nThe communications with Mr. Berg and Mr. House show that even after Mr. Assange was indicted on accusations of computer hacking, the United States government was eager to build a case against a WikiLeaks associate for disseminating state secrets \u2014 a charge that spoke directly to the group\u2019s main enterprise, but would also thrust the Justice Department into a thorny fight over First Amendment rights and galvanize supporters of WikiLeaks and of the free press.\nThey also show that prosecutors were focused mainly on work done by WikiLeaks in 2010, when Mr. Assange received classified and secret information from Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and American diplomacy overseas.\nMr. Assange worked with reporters at publications including The New York Times, The Guardian and the German magazine Der Spiegel to publish that information. Eric H. Holder Jr., then the attorney general, announced a criminal investigation of WikiLeaks.\nJustice Department officials under the Obama administration ultimately decided they could not prosecute Mr. Assange for sharing information because it risked setting a precedent that could erode press freedoms for news organizations that also publish classified information.\nBut prosecutors in Northern Virginia continued to explore ways to crack down on WikiLeaks.\nThe letter to Mr. Berg, dated March 7, 2018 \u2014 one day after Mr. Assange was secretly indicted \u2014 was sent by Tracy Doherty-McCormick, a cybercrime and national security specialist who worked on the Assange case while she was a federal prosecutor in Virginia under the Obama administration. She was also the acting United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia when Mr. Assange was indicted.\nMs. Doherty-McCormick wrote that the interview would be voluntary, and it was unclear whether Mr. Berg ultimately spoke with prosecutors. The German publication Die Zeit first reported the case against Mr. Berg.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to say whether the government had dropped its case against Mr. Berg or whether there were any sealed charges against him or any other WikiLeaks associates.\nIn his interviews with prosecutors and the grand jury, Mr. House denied any role in the leak of the documents from Ms. Manning to WikiLeaks, the person said. Mr. House\u2019s interview with prosecutors and grand jury testimony were reported earlier by The Daily Beast and The Washington Post.\nHe was asked about online chats among WikiLeaks workers that investigators had obtained and was questioned about discussions inside the group about when to redact names from documents posted on the internet.\nThe question of redactions became a point of contention in 2010, after human rights groups criticized WikiLeaks for exposing the names of Afghan citizens who had assisted the United States and might be subject to retaliation. The group subsequently stripped names from many documents but remained inconsistent in its practices.\nIt is unclear whether investigators were considering whether endangering people named in the government documents by posting them online might violate a criminal statute.\nMr. Assange was ultimately accused of unsuccessfully helping Ms. Manning try to log onto a classified military network by breaking a passcode and using another person\u2019s identity. He was charged with a single computer hacking offense.\nThe indictment against Mr. Assange did not include any charge related to the receipt or publication of secret information, but he was accused of hacking into a government computer system \u201cin furtherance of a criminal act\u201d that violated laws against obtaining material to harm the United States or to aid a foreign power.\nNor did the indictment mention the 2016 election or Mr. Assange\u2019s decision to post to WikiLeaks troves of Democratic emails stolen by Russian government hackers.\nThe special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, secured an indictment against 12 Russian military officers in the thefts, describing them as part of the Kremlin\u2019s campaign to undermine the American electoral process and help Mr. Trump win the election. The Russians used online personas including Guccifer 2.0 to work with people and organizations in a position to spread the information, including WikiLeaks, according to the indictment.\nWikiLeaks\u2019 publication of the stolen Democratic emails may have been omitted from Mr. Assange\u2019s indictment in part because mention of the election could cast the Justice Department\u2019s charges against Mr. Assange in a more political light, legal experts said, and harm the administration\u2019s chances of extraditing him from Britain to stand trial in the United States.",

Then she cited The Eagle Eye&rsquo;s submission, which described how Parkland&rsquo;s 44 student reporters and editors had to &ldquo;put aside our grief and recognize our role as both survivors, journalists and loved ones of the deceased.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These budding journalists remind us of the media&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to bearing witness, even in the most wrenching of circumstances, in service to a nation whose very existence depends on a free and dedicated press,&rdquo; Ms. Canedy said. &ldquo;There is hope in their example.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The recognition was momentous for scholastic journalism, an important training ground for young reporters, who often feel that their achievements in the field get little attention from professional organizations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, I don&rsquo;t think that adults &mdash; and publications like The New York Times and The Washington Post &mdash; they don&rsquo;t get to see that amazing work,&rdquo; said Rebecca Schneid, 17, The Eagle Eye&rsquo;s other co-editor, who has considered joining the student newspaper when she attends Duke University this fall. &ldquo;And a lot of times, student journalists underestimate the power of their words or their ability to make a difference.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In an interview on Tuesday, Ms. Canedy said student entries are always her favorites, but the quality of The Eagle Eye&rsquo;s reporting stood out. &ldquo;It was actually a very competitive entry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was so inspired by what they did.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Canedy said she plans to reach out in the coming days to invite some of The Eagle Eye staff to the Pulitzer luncheon in New York next month as her guests.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the future,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in good hands with young people like this.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As the winners were announced on Monday, the half-dozen student editors who gathered around the computer screen with their faculty adviser, Melissa Falkowski, realized with a bit of disappointment that they had missed out on an award. Yet they had been honored in front of a national audience nonetheless.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t usually mention the losers,&rdquo; said Ms. Falkowski, 36.</p>\n<p>By Tuesday, the initial disappointment had turned to sheer pride.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The work our newspaper did last year &mdash; and continues to do this year &mdash; was the most newsworthy work we&rsquo;ve done and probably ever will do,&rdquo; said Ms. Kapoor, a senior who intends to remain in journalism once she starts college at Princeton University.</p>\n<p>Ms. Kapoor helped prepare the Pulitzer entry in January, submitting The Eagle Eye&rsquo;s work in the prize categories for public service and breaking news after exploring whether student entries were barred from the competition. (They are not.) True to form for journalists conditioned to operating on deadline, the Parkland students started compiling the entry two days before it was due.</p>\n<p>The Eagle Eye editors realized that an entry of 17 obituaries and a range of stories about student activism against gun violence would be atypical fare for the Pulitzers, which tend to reward major investigative reporting and sublime feature writing. So they included a note telling the judges that their work was important because it offered a distinct perspective of the students&rsquo; trauma following the massacre.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was very happy that they took us seriously,&rdquo; said Dara Rosen, a 17-year-old junior and copy editor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really difficult, but at the same time, really empowering to be able to write, from an insider&rsquo;s perspective, what your school is going through and what is happening.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>No one on staff was forced to cover the shooting, yet many of the editors volunteered to write the obituaries themselves.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At first, I was very hesitant of taking on that role,&rdquo; said Leni Steinhardt, 17, who wrote the obituary for Alyssa Alhadeff, 14. &ldquo;I was really thinking, &lsquo;If God forbid anything happens to me, I would want the right person to write my obituary.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Students also had to contend with the grim realization that The Eagle Eye, which has received numerous scholastic journalism accolades and even published <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/We-Say-NeverAgain-Reporting-Journalists/dp/1984849964/ref=nodl_\">a book compiling the newspaper&rsquo;s work</a> after the shooting, attracted so much attention because of a deadly tragedy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel I deserve to be doing this at the expense of 17 people,&rdquo; Ms. Steinhardt said. &ldquo;But Falkowski always reminds us that we&rsquo;re doing this <em>for</em> them. I&rsquo;d rather it be us telling the story than some other news reporter who doesn&rsquo;t really have a connection to them like we do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In a sobering accounting of the biggest news of 2018, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/business/media/pulitzer-prizes.html\">three Pulitzers were awarded Monday</a> to newspapers for their coverage of three separate mass shootings in Parkland, Pittsburgh and Annapolis, Md. The staff of The Sun Sentinel of South Florida won the most prestigious prize, for public service reporting, for its work in Parkland.</p>\n<p>Last year, The Sun Sentinel reprinted The Eagle Eye&rsquo;s memorial issue and inserted it into its newspaper, bringing the students&rsquo; work to tens of thousands of local subscribers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just so impressed by them,&rdquo; Julie Anderson, the editor in chief of the Sun Sentinel, said on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The previous day, the staff of The Sun Sentinel &mdash; much like the students &mdash; had gathered around a bank of televisions to watch the Pulitzer announcement. When The Eagle Eye was honored, The Sun Sentinel newsroom broke out into sustained applause.</p>",

True to form for journalists conditioned to operating on deadline, the Parkland students started compiling the entry two days before it was due.\nThe Eagle Eye editors realized that an entry of 17 obituaries and a range of stories about student activism against gun violence would be atypical fare for the Pulitzers, which tend to reward major investigative reporting and sublime feature writing. So they included a note telling the judges that their work was important because it offered a distinct perspective of the students\u2019 trauma following the massacre.\n\u201cI was very happy that they took us seriously,\u201d said Dara Rosen, a 17-year-old junior and copy editor. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult, but at the same time, really empowering to be able to write, from an insider\u2019s perspective, what your school is going through and what is happening.\u201d\nNo one on staff was forced to cover the shooting, yet many of the editors volunteered to write the obituaries themselves.\n\u201cAt first, I was very hesitant of taking on that role,\u201d said Leni Steinhardt, 17, who wrote the obituary for Alyssa Alhadeff, 14. \u201cI was really thinking, \u2018If God forbid anything happens to me, I would want the right person to write my obituary.\u2019\u201d\nStudents also had to contend with the grim realization that The Eagle Eye, which has received numerous scholastic journalism accolades and even published a book compiling the newspaper\u2019s work after the shooting, attracted so much attention because of a deadly tragedy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel I deserve to be doing this at the expense of 17 people,\u201d Ms. Steinhardt said. \u201cBut Falkowski always reminds us that we\u2019re doing this for them. I\u2019d rather it be us telling the story than some other news reporter who doesn\u2019t really have a connection to them like we do.\u201d\nIn a sobering accounting of the biggest news of 2018, three Pulitzers were awarded Monday to newspapers for their coverage of three separate mass shootings in Parkland, Pittsburgh and Annapolis, Md. The staff of The Sun Sentinel of South Florida won the most prestigious prize, for public service reporting, for its work in Parkland.\nLast year, The Sun Sentinel reprinted The Eagle Eye\u2019s memorial issue and inserted it into its newspaper, bringing the students\u2019 work to tens of thousands of local subscribers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just so impressed by them,\u201d Julie Anderson, the editor in chief of the Sun Sentinel, said on Tuesday.\nThe previous day, the staff of The Sun Sentinel \u2014 much like the students \u2014 had gathered around a bank of televisions to watch the Pulitzer announcement. When The Eagle Eye was honored, The Sun Sentinel newsroom broke out into sustained applause.",

Army officials called him at work to tell him that his wife&rsquo;s military police unit had been attacked in Kunar Province, Afghanistan. She didn&rsquo;t survive.</p>\n<p>The small family was getting by with help from his wife&rsquo;s parents until last week, when another crisis struck: Mr. Gonzalez Carranza was deported back to Mexico, a country he hadn&rsquo;t seen since he was a teenager. His daughter, Evelyn, now 12, was left parentless, living with her grandparents, who share custody.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was in shock,&rdquo; Mr. Gonzalez Carranza, 30, said of the moment he found himself in the back of a government vehicle in Mexico. Questions had raced through his mind. Why was he there? What would happen to his daughter? Hadn&rsquo;t she been through enough?</p>\n<p>As it turned out, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials reversed their decision, and Mr. Gonzalez Carranza returned home to Phoenix on Monday. But the case that raised an outcry in Arizona is one of many that have slipped through the cracks of an increasingly strained immigration system.</p>\n<p>Two trends &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/us/border-crossing-increase.html\">record-breaking numbers of incoming families seeking asylum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/us/politics/illegal-immigrant-arrests-deportations-rise.html\">increasing arrests of immigrants without legal status</a> already living in the country &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/us/immigration-border-mexico.html\">are adding to the immigration court backlog</a>, which now exceeds 800,000 cases. Officials throughout the system, from Border Patrol officers to government prosecutors, to the judges who oversee deportations, say they are struggling to keep up with the demands of an increasingly aggressive immigration enforcement agenda.</p>\n<p>There is <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1984/02/21/262012.html?action=click&contentCollection=Archives&module=LedeAsset&region=ArchiveBody&pgtype=article&pageNumber=16\">a long history</a> of wrongful deportations that span several administrations and they are only rarely reversed, according to immigration lawyers.</p>\n<p>In one recent case, Muneer Subaihani, an Iraqi immigrant who had lived in the United States for 25 years, was deported in 2017, in spite of a court order prohibiting the deportation of about 1,400 Iraqis. But he was only allowed back into the country in January &mdash; and it was the first time that anyone from Iraq who had been erroneously expelled had been allowed back in, the American Civil Liberties Union said.</p>\n<p>Last year, another man identified in court documents only as W.G.A. <a href=\"http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2018/D08-21/C%3A16-4193%3AJ%3AHamilton%3Aaut%3AT%3AfnOp%3AN%3A2205587%3AS%3A0\">was brought back</a> to the United States after being wrongfully deported to El Salvador while his asylum case was under appeal &mdash; a situation that should have triggered an automatic temporary stay.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a chronic problem,&rdquo; said Scott Shuchart, who worked in the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s civil rights office from 2010 to 2018. &ldquo;The number of cases that fall through the cracks of that system, it may be very low as a percentage, but it&rsquo;s certainly nontrivial as a raw count of cases.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Gonzalez Carranza was lucky, according to his lawyer.</p>\n<p>The problems began last January when Mr. Gonzalez Carranza, who had entered the country illegally, went to his lawyer to renew a temporary permit to live in the United States that he had been granted based on his deceased wife&rsquo;s military service. They learned that a removal case against him had been opened even though the permit was still valid, but he hadn&rsquo;t heard about it because the notices had been sent to an old address. Months earlier, it turned out, he had been ordered deported.</p>\n<p>Knowing that he could be arrested at any time, Mr. Gonzalez Carranza and his lawyer moved quickly to prepare documents to halt the deportation. But before the papers were filed, immigration agents arrested Mr. Gonzalez Carranza on April 8, pulling him over as he was driving to work. He said he remembered flashing lights and then &ldquo;a lot of cops around me pointing guns, screaming, saying &lsquo;Open the door!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Gonzalez Carranza had first entered the United States on his own at the age of 14 and moved in with an uncle in Phoenix. Rather than going to school, he started working for a carpeting company and met the woman who became his wife, Barbara Vieyra, at a nightclub for teenagers.</p>\n<p>The couple moved in together, had their daughter, Evelyn, and they married. Soon after, Ms. Vieyra joined the Army to help support her family. She served in a military police unit in Korea and was 22 when she was killed in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/mesa/2019/04/15/mesa-mother-barbara-vieyra-killed-in-afghanistan-first-southeast-valley/3481176002/\">according to news reports. </a></p>\n<p>Mr. Gonzalez Carranza remained in the United States without permanent legal status, sharing custody of his daughter with his wife&rsquo;s parents. His wife&rsquo;s military service should have allowed him to remain in the country legally until April 20, 2019.</p>\n<p>He could make none of that clear to the officers who came to arrest and deport him. During the days he spent in Mexico, Mr. Gonzalez Carranza said, he passed the time inside a Mexican government office because it was close enough to the border that his American cellphone still worked and he was able to talk with his lawyer. He slept at a migrant shelter, mostly filled with people waiting to seek asylum in the United States.</p>\n<p>Ezequiel Hernandez, his lawyer, said his client was finally allowed back into the United States on Monday after a government lawyer notified him that Mr. Gonzalez Carranza should go to the legal port of entry in Nogales, Mexico, within an hour. Mr. Hernandez said he was not certain why immigration authorities reversed their decision, but believed that <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2019/04/16/barbara-vieyra-died-fighting-u-s-then-u-s-deported-jose-arturo-gonzalez-carranza/3481700002/\">media reports</a> about the deportation may have contributed to the decision.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, a day after returning to Arizona, Mr. Gonzalez Carranza said he had still not seen his daughter, who was with her grandparents, but was looking forward to seeing her.</p>\n<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials confirmed Mr. Gonzalez Carranza&rsquo;s deportation and said in a statement that he had been permitted to re-enter the United States &ldquo;pending adjudication of his immigration proceedings.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Hernandez said he planned to argue that his client should be granted permanent legal status in the United States because of the extreme hardship that his daughter would face, compounded by the loss of her mother, if her father were to be deported.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Usually it&rsquo;s people that have no resources, no attorney,&rdquo; Mr. Hernandez said. &ldquo;What would happen if he didn&rsquo;t have all of these things? He&rsquo;d be in Nogales today and you would never know.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]\nIt was Jose Arturo Gonzalez Carranza\u2019s 22nd birthday when he found himself suddenly alone to take care of his 3-year-old daughter. Army officials called him at work to tell him that his wife\u2019s military police unit had been attacked in Kunar Province, Afghanistan. She didn\u2019t survive.\nThe small family was getting by with help from his wife\u2019s parents until last week, when another crisis struck: Mr. Gonzalez Carranza was deported back to Mexico, a country he hadn\u2019t seen since he was a teenager. His daughter, Evelyn, now 12, was left parentless, living with her grandparents, who share custody.\n\u201cI was in shock,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez Carranza, 30, said of the moment he found himself in the back of a government vehicle in Mexico. Questions had raced through his mind. Why was he there? What would happen to his daughter? Hadn\u2019t she been through enough?\nAs it turned out, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials reversed their decision, and Mr. Gonzalez Carranza returned home to Phoenix on Monday. But the case that raised an outcry in Arizona is one of many that have slipped through the cracks of an increasingly strained immigration system.\nTwo trends \u2014 record-breaking numbers of incoming families seeking asylum and increasing arrests of immigrants without legal status already living in the country \u2014 are adding to the immigration court backlog, which now exceeds 800,000 cases. Officials throughout the system, from Border Patrol officers to government prosecutors, to the judges who oversee deportations, say they are struggling to keep up with the demands of an increasingly aggressive immigration enforcement agenda.\nThere is a long history of wrongful deportations that span several administrations and they are only rarely reversed, according to immigration lawyers.\nIn one recent case, Muneer Subaihani, an Iraqi immigrant who had lived in the United States for 25 years, was deported in 2017, in spite of a court order prohibiting the deportation of about 1,400 Iraqis. But he was only allowed back into the country in January \u2014 and it was the first time that anyone from Iraq who had been erroneously expelled had been allowed back in, the American Civil Liberties Union said.\nLast year, another man identified in court documents only as W.G.A. was brought back to the United States after being wrongfully deported to El Salvador while his asylum case was under appeal \u2014 a situation that should have triggered an automatic temporary stay.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chronic problem,\u201d said Scott Shuchart, who worked in the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s civil rights office from 2010 to 2018. \u201cThe number of cases that fall through the cracks of that system, it may be very low as a percentage, but it\u2019s certainly nontrivial as a raw count of cases.\u201d\nMr. Gonzalez Carranza was lucky, according to his lawyer.\nThe problems began last January when Mr. Gonzalez Carranza, who had entered the country illegally, went to his lawyer to renew a temporary permit to live in the United States that he had been granted based on his deceased wife\u2019s military service. They learned that a removal case against him had been opened even though the permit was still valid, but he hadn\u2019t heard about it because the notices had been sent to an old address. Months earlier, it turned out, he had been ordered deported.\nKnowing that he could be arrested at any time, Mr. Gonzalez Carranza and his lawyer moved quickly to prepare documents to halt the deportation. But before the papers were filed, immigration agents arrested Mr. Gonzalez Carranza on April 8, pulling him over as he was driving to work. He said he remembered flashing lights and then \u201ca lot of cops around me pointing guns, screaming, saying \u2018Open the door!\u2019\u201d\nMr. Gonzalez Carranza had first entered the United States on his own at the age of 14 and moved in with an uncle in Phoenix. Rather than going to school, he started working for a carpeting company and met the woman who became his wife, Barbara Vieyra, at a nightclub for teenagers.\nThe couple moved in together, had their daughter, Evelyn, and they married. Soon after, Ms. Vieyra joined the Army to help support her family. She served in a military police unit in Korea and was 22 when she was killed in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, according to news reports.\nMr. Gonzalez Carranza remained in the United States without permanent legal status, sharing custody of his daughter with his wife\u2019s parents. His wife\u2019s military service should have allowed him to remain in the country legally until April 20, 2019.\nHe could make none of that clear to the officers who came to arrest and deport him. During the days he spent in Mexico, Mr. Gonzalez Carranza said, he passed the time inside a Mexican government office because it was close enough to the border that his American cellphone still worked and he was able to talk with his lawyer. He slept at a migrant shelter, mostly filled with people waiting to seek asylum in the United States.\nEzequiel Hernandez, his lawyer, said his client was finally allowed back into the United States on Monday after a government lawyer notified him that Mr. Gonzalez Carranza should go to the legal port of entry in Nogales, Mexico, within an hour. Mr. Hernandez said he was not certain why immigration authorities reversed their decision, but believed that media reports about the deportation may have contributed to the decision.\nOn Tuesday, a day after returning to Arizona, Mr. Gonzalez Carranza said he had still not seen his daughter, who was with her grandparents, but was looking forward to seeing her.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officials confirmed Mr. Gonzalez Carranza\u2019s deportation and said in a statement that he had been permitted to re-enter the United States \u201cpending adjudication of his immigration proceedings.\u201d\nMr. Hernandez said he planned to argue that his client should be granted permanent legal status in the United States because of the extreme hardship that his daughter would face, compounded by the loss of her mother, if her father were to be deported.\n\u201cUsually it\u2019s people that have no resources, no attorney,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said. \u201cWhat would happen if he didn\u2019t have all of these things? He\u2019d be in Nogales today and you would never know.\u201d",

The tragedy may even offer a fillip of support to a president who polled low even before the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/23/world/europe/france-yellow-vests-future.html\">months of violent &ldquo;Yellow Vest&rdquo; protests</a> erupted late last year. The question is for how long.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I believe very deeply that it is up to us to transform this catastrophe into a moment to become &mdash; while reflecting deeply on what we have been, and what we should be &mdash; better than what we are,&rdquo; the president said in a nationally televised address, deploying the typically abstract language that has hurt him politically.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is up to us now to rediscover the thread of our national project &mdash; what made us, what unites us,&rdquo; Mr. Macron said.</p>\n<p>Backing Mr. Macron&rsquo;s words, politics indeed stopped on Tuesday, with the political parties declaring a truce as though it were wartime and the country had been attacked.</p>\n<p>One after another, on the left, right and center, the parties canceled their meetings, their attacks on Mr. Macron and their campaigning for the European elections.</p>\n<p>Mr. Macron himself shelved a much anticipated speech he was supposed to give Monday night outlining his analysis of what his government called <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/world/europe/france-macron-yellow-vest.html\">the Great National Debate</a> &mdash; three months in which citizens voiced their grievances, mostly over taxes.</p>\n<p>The president was all set to announce measures to meet these grievances and calm the Yellow Vests &mdash; lower taxes, higher pensions, an opening up of institutions.</p>\n<p>But then the fire struck, the speech was canceled and Mr. Macron himself joined the truce declared by the other political parties.</p>\n<p>But this appeared to have little to do with Mr. Macron, and much to do with the national grief over Notre-Dame.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all living this moment, collectively, as a moment of mourning,&rdquo; said a leader of the center-right Republican Party, Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Bellamy, on the French television channel LCI Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The truce is likely to be only temporary, in the estimation of analysts.</p>\n<p>The protests revealed such high levels of discontent, and of &ldquo;fragmentation&rdquo; in the &ldquo;French archipelago,&rdquo; as the leading pollster J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Fourquet put it in an influential recent book on French disunity, that whatever boost the president gets is likely to be short-lived.</p>\n<p><em>[See more </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/world/europe/photos-of-notre-dame-fire.html\"><em>photos of the fire and its aftermath</em></a><em>.]</em></p>\n<p>&ldquo;He wants to make the national reconstruction project a Macron project,&rdquo; G&eacute;rard Grunberg, a political scientist, said after listening to Mr. Macron&rsquo;s speech. &ldquo;He wants to make it his project. It&rsquo;s a project for France that he wants to put himself at the head of: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m the one who will give you back your cathedral.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Mr. Grunberg was skeptical that the mission would take hold with a French public that remains deeply skeptical of Mr. Macron, a youthful former investment banker who captured the presidency two years ago as France&rsquo;s political party system collapsed around him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very rare for a chief of state to have a great national project around which everybody can rally,&rdquo; Mr. Grunberg said. &ldquo;Since the beginning, I&rsquo;ve been struck by how difficult it has been for him to enlarge his majority,&rdquo; which received only 24 percent in the first round of voting in 2017, he added.</p>\n<p>Mr. Macron is now above that in the polls, but not by much, even after undertaking an extended speaking tour of France.</p>\n<p>Other reactions suggested that the moment of national unity may already be waning.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that five years to reconstruct a cathedral is a little bit short; five years to have to put up with Emmanuel Macron&rsquo;s speeches is a bit long,&rdquo; said Manuel Bompard, a leader of the leftist party France Insoumise, or France Unbowed.</p>\n<p>Mr. Macron sought to place the national tragedy of Notre-Dame&rsquo;s near destruction in the context of the great sweep of French history, as he often does, a habit intended to reassure citizens of his long-term vision for the nation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In the course of our history, we&rsquo;ve built cities, ports, churches,&rdquo; Mr. Macron said. &ldquo;Many have burned or were destroyed in wars, revolutions or by man&rsquo;s mistakes. Each time, each time, we&rsquo;ve rebuilt them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The fire at Notre-Dame reminds us that our history doesn&rsquo;t end, doesn&rsquo;t end,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>But the grief that the French were experiencing in the wake of the fire was much more personal than Mr. Macron&rsquo;s abstractions suggested.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday night, hundreds congregated for song and prayers in the Place Saint Michel, opposite Notre-Dame. During the day, hundreds more had massed at the bridge leading on to the church plaza.</p>\n<p>On Monday night, watching the flames in horror from the river bank, many were in tears, as if they had been struck personally by the disaster.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thousand years of memory that&rsquo;s going,&rdquo; said Marlene Ruat, a 34-year-old hospital worker. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s causing me a lot of pain,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can see here,&rdquo; she said, pointing at the crowd. &ldquo;Everybody is quiet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For others, the symbolism of the destruction, and what it said about the current condition of France, and its political and economic management of the balance between its glorious but sometimes burdensome history and the need to renew and move forward, was inescapable.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There have been three cases like this in 10 years,&rdquo; said Pierre Housieaux, the president of the Paris-Historique historic preservation society, citing other disastrous fires at historic monuments.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing monuments ravaged by fires that are always tied to renovation work,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and we still haven&rsquo;t taken the measure of things.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "PARIS \u2014 President Emmanuel Macron asked French citizens on Tuesday night to come together in the aftermath of the calamitous fire at Notre-Dame Cathedral and to move beyond the divisions that have wrenched the country during months of violent street protests.\nMr. Macron, who has faced a virtual uprising against his pro-business government, sought to rally a country still devastated by the fire and turn the profound, yet undoubtedly fleeting, moment of national mourning and unity to his advantage.\nLike his predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who steered France through two terrorist attacks, Mr. Macron suggested that politics be forgotten in the aftermath of the fire and called attention to the grand national rebuilding project \u2014 vowing to restore the gargantuan Gothic gem in a mere five years.\n\u201cSo, yes, we will rebuild Notre-Dame Cathedral, more beautiful than ever, and I want this to be finished in five years,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cWe can do it, and we will mobilize to do so.\u201d\nAfter an inspection Tuesday, with firefighters still searching for smoldering embers, the French authorities declared the 850-year-old cathedral structurally sound, if wounded by three troubling \u201choles\u201d in the sweeping vaulted ceiling.\nHow the fire started remains under intensive investigation, though the authorities were treating the disaster as an accident, focusing on workers who were carrying out another round of nearly constant renovations at the scaffolding-shrouded site.\nWealthy benefactors \u2014 including the French energy company Total, L\u2019Or\u00e9al and the family of Bernard Arnault, the richest man in France \u2014 quickly pledged hundreds of millions toward restoration of what, even in its charred state, remained a national and global treasure.\nNone of the simmering questions and recriminations about whether the landmark was properly fitted with fire-safety measures \u2014 the authorities had decided against sprinklers amid the timbers under the roof where the blaze spread \u2014 have yet been turned on Mr. Macron.\nMr. Macron, who went to the site even as it still burned on Monday evening, has presented himself as the image of control and authority. The tragedy may even offer a fillip of support to a president who polled low even before the months of violent \u201cYellow Vest\u201d protests erupted late last year. The question is for how long.\n\u201cI believe very deeply that it is up to us to transform this catastrophe into a moment to become \u2014 while reflecting deeply on what we have been, and what we should be \u2014 better than what we are,\u201d the president said in a nationally televised address, deploying the typically abstract language that has hurt him politically.\n\u201cIt is up to us now to rediscover the thread of our national project \u2014 what made us, what unites us,\u201d Mr. Macron said.\nBacking Mr. Macron\u2019s words, politics indeed stopped on Tuesday, with the political parties declaring a truce as though it were wartime and the country had been attacked.\nOne after another, on the left, right and center, the parties canceled their meetings, their attacks on Mr. Macron and their campaigning for the European elections.\nMr. Macron himself shelved a much anticipated speech he was supposed to give Monday night outlining his analysis of what his government called the Great National Debate \u2014 three months in which citizens voiced their grievances, mostly over taxes.\nThe president was all set to announce measures to meet these grievances and calm the Yellow Vests \u2014 lower taxes, higher pensions, an opening up of institutions.\nBut then the fire struck, the speech was canceled and Mr. Macron himself joined the truce declared by the other political parties.\nBut this appeared to have little to do with Mr. Macron, and much to do with the national grief over Notre-Dame.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all living this moment, collectively, as a moment of mourning,\u201d said a leader of the center-right Republican Party, Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bellamy, on the French television channel LCI Tuesday.\nThe truce is likely to be only temporary, in the estimation of analysts.\nThe protests revealed such high levels of discontent, and of \u201cfragmentation\u201d in the \u201cFrench archipelago,\u201d as the leading pollster J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet put it in an influential recent book on French disunity, that whatever boost the president gets is likely to be short-lived.\n[See more photos of the fire and its aftermath.]\n\u201cHe wants to make the national reconstruction project a Macron project,\u201d G\u00e9rard Grunberg, a political scientist, said after listening to Mr. Macron\u2019s speech. \u201cHe wants to make it his project. It\u2019s a project for France that he wants to put himself at the head of: \u2018I\u2019m the one who will give you back your cathedral.\u2019\u201d\nBut Mr. Grunberg was skeptical that the mission would take hold with a French public that remains deeply skeptical of Mr. Macron, a youthful former investment banker who captured the presidency two years ago as France\u2019s political party system collapsed around him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare for a chief of state to have a great national project around which everybody can rally,\u201d Mr. Grunberg said. \u201cSince the beginning, I\u2019ve been struck by how difficult it has been for him to enlarge his majority,\u201d which received only 24 percent in the first round of voting in 2017, he added.\nMr. Macron is now above that in the polls, but not by much, even after undertaking an extended speaking tour of France.\nOther reactions suggested that the moment of national unity may already be waning.\n\u201cIt seems to me that five years to reconstruct a cathedral is a little bit short; five years to have to put up with Emmanuel Macron\u2019s speeches is a bit long,\u201d said Manuel Bompard, a leader of the leftist party France Insoumise, or France Unbowed.\nMr. Macron sought to place the national tragedy of Notre-Dame\u2019s near destruction in the context of the great sweep of French history, as he often does, a habit intended to reassure citizens of his long-term vision for the nation.\n\u201cIn the course of our history, we\u2019ve built cities, ports, churches,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cMany have burned or were destroyed in wars, revolutions or by man\u2019s mistakes. Each time, each time, we\u2019ve rebuilt them.\u201d\n\u201cThe fire at Notre-Dame reminds us that our history doesn\u2019t end, doesn\u2019t end,\u201d he added.\nBut the grief that the French were experiencing in the wake of the fire was much more personal than Mr. Macron\u2019s abstractions suggested.\nOn Tuesday night, hundreds congregated for song and prayers in the Place Saint Michel, opposite Notre-Dame. During the day, hundreds more had massed at the bridge leading on to the church plaza.\nOn Monday night, watching the flames in horror from the river bank, many were in tears, as if they had been struck personally by the disaster.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thousand years of memory that\u2019s going,\u201d said Marlene Ruat, a 34-year-old hospital worker. \u201cIt\u2019s causing me a lot of pain,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can see here,\u201d she said, pointing at the crowd. \u201cEverybody is quiet.\u201d\nFor others, the symbolism of the destruction, and what it said about the current condition of France, and its political and economic management of the balance between its glorious but sometimes burdensome history and the need to renew and move forward, was inescapable.\n\u201cThere have been three cases like this in 10 years,\u201d said Pierre Housieaux, the president of the Paris-Historique historic preservation society, citing other disastrous fires at historic monuments.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing monuments ravaged by fires that are always tied to renovation work,\u201d he said, \u201cand we still haven\u2019t taken the measure of things.\u201d",

I had invited him to see the performance, and now he was digesting it over a vodka martini.</p>\n<p>When a black screen at the Park Avenue Armory rose to reveal a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/theater/lehman-trilogy-glass-box-park-avenue-armory.html\">stark glass box</a>, a stripped-down version of Lehman&rsquo;s emptied offices hours before the bankruptcy filing, Mr. Russo let out a gasp: &ldquo;Oh, my God.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was the feeling,&rdquo; he said later, explaining his visceral reaction to the scene. Mr. Russo said he had ended up quarterbacking that fateful Sunday board meeting at the suggestion of Lehman&rsquo;s chief executive, Richard S. Fuld Jr., &ldquo;because he, and pretty much everybody in the room, was in total disbelief.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As it turns out, the firm&rsquo;s actual disbandment occupies just a few minutes of the script. The central story focuses on the original <a href=\"https://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/lehman\">Lehman brothers</a> &mdash; three immigrants from Bavaria who came to this &ldquo;magical music box called America&rdquo; in the mid-19th century &mdash; and their offspring.</p>\n<p>After opening a tiny fabric store in Montgomery, Ala., the men turned to brokering cotton between the slave-producing plantations in the South and industrial manufacturers in the North. After the Civil War, they expanded to other commodities before concentrating on financial services and later metamorphosing into the nation&rsquo;s fourth-largest investment bank. Along the way the firm invested in tobacco and the Panama Canal, Hollywood&rsquo;s original &ldquo;King Kong&rdquo; and Intel microprocessors.</p>\n<p>The play follows the ferocious and glittering financial locomotive they rode through American capitalism for more than a century and a half before being roughly dumped off. But that momentous collapse serves as the story&rsquo;s frame, bracketing its start and its finish.</p>\n<h2>Echoes of 1929</h2>\n<p>The play&rsquo;s narrative arc makes Lehman Brothers&rsquo; hubristic fall seem inevitable. Mr. Russo, though, emphasizes that he always thought the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/03/federal-reserve-lehman-brothers-collapse\">investment firm&rsquo;s bankruptcy was avoidable</a> and that the Federal Reserve erred in not saving the bank.</p>\n<p>So for him, a goose-bump moment came during a scene depicting a previous crisis, the 1929 crash, which Lehman Brothers managed to survive.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The state will let the first banks fail, won&rsquo;t lift a finger,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/08/10/89015998.pdf\">Bobbie</a>, a Lehman grandson, explains in the play, standing in the same glass cube of an office that serves as a stage for the 21st-century action. &ldquo;They need to look like they aren&rsquo;t helping.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He continues: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we shouldn&rsquo;t help the other banks in crisis: If they ask for loans, we should say no. The state will do the same. After that first moment, the state will need strong banks and they&rsquo;ll help us. If we can survive the first month, they won&rsquo;t let us fail.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Afterward, Mr. Russo talked about that calamitous 2008 weekend. &ldquo;It was exactly what happened in the play,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Everyone was more interested in protecting themselves than honoring commitments.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When Fed officials asked the heads of competing major banks if they could survive a Lehman bankruptcy, they replied yes, Mr. Russo said. &ldquo;That probably had a significant impact on the decision to let Lehman go,&rdquo; he maintained. Soon, those institutions, were receiving the same kind of government assistance denied to Lehman.</p>\n<p>There were other echoes. Regulation and forced diversification would be the response to Wall Street&rsquo;s excesses, Bobbie Lehman says. And &ldquo;the economy will stop growing, unemployment will rise and the whole system will go into paralysis.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Bobbie&rsquo;s talk was very much 2008 as it was 1929,&rdquo; Mr. Russo said.</p>\n<h2>A Family Pilgrimage</h2>\n<p>The &ldquo;Trilogy&rdquo; will head to London&rsquo;s West End after it finishes its four-week run on Saturday. This production, directed by Sam Mendes, was adapted from the original, which was written in Italian by <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stefano-massini-playwright-lehman-brothers-trilogy-8tkstvxvs\">Stefano Massini</a> and ran five hours.</p>\n<p>Partly reflecting the high-altitude ticket prices ($425 for premium seats), New York audiences have included outsize numbers of financiers, as well as Lehman progeny who went to see the replay of a catastrophic downfall.</p>\n<p>Wendy Lehman Lash, great-granddaughter of Mayer Lehman, the youngest of the three brothers, served as a conduit for tickets. &ldquo;I would say over 100 Lehman offspring have seen it,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Ms. Lash&rsquo;s paternal grandfather, Herbert Lehman, spent most of his career in politics, and served as New York&rsquo;s governor and as a senator. Despite her Lehman roots, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know this story, how they reinvented themselves,&rdquo; Ms. Lash said of the founding patriarchs after seeing the play. &ldquo;How Lehman had to go from cotton to banking.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ambassadorloeb.com/philanthropist/publications/\">John L. Loeb Jr.</a>, an 88-year-old family scion who researched the family history for a self-published memoir, has seen the show three times. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful theater, but it&rsquo;s largely the imagination of the author,&rdquo; Mr. Loeb said. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t quite tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ever since 2008, Mr. Loeb has chafed against the public&rsquo;s equating the Lehman family itself with the financial crisis. Bobbie Lehman, who <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/08/10/89015998.pdf\">died in 1969</a>, was the last family member to lead the firm. And as Mr. Loeb pointed out, American Express <a href=\"https://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/lehman/Exhibition/Leadership-Transitions\">bought the company in 1984</a>. A decade later, it spun off Lehman Brothers&rsquo; financial service operations through a public stock offering, and Mr. Fuld became chairman and chief executive.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m affected by the fact that our name is identified with one of the greatest crashes in history, and the Lehmans weren&rsquo;t really like that,&rdquo; Mr. Loeb said. &ldquo;Mr. Fuld was a person I don&rsquo;t think would have ever become a partner of the Lehman Brothers I knew.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Fuld started as a summer intern at Lehman in 1966 and was named a partner in 1978.</p>\n<h2>&lsquo;Accurate, but It Is One Side&rsquo;</h2>\n<p>Mr. Loeb&rsquo;s comments reflect the hostile divide depicted in &ldquo;Trilogy&rsquo;s&rdquo; third act between the bone-crunching aggressiveness of the traders who brought in unimagined earnings and the old-style bankers, with their &ldquo;velvet and cuff links,&rdquo; who loved the profits but disdained the ways they were acquired.</p>\n<p>For Mr. Russo, the third act gave him an opportunity to contrast his own impressions of characters he knew, like Mr. Fuld, with their description onstage.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent more time with Dick probably than anybody else,&rdquo; said Mr. Russo, who for years had an office next door to Mr. Fuld&rsquo;s, and recently had lunch with his friend. After the bankruptcy, Mr. Fuld, who presided over Lehman&rsquo;s demise, was <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/business/52603/\">cast as an archvillain</a>. In &ldquo;Trilogy,&rdquo; he is referred to by his nickname, the Gorilla, a man who &ldquo;carved his way through Wall Street,&rdquo; but Mr. Russo insisted, &ldquo;Basically he&rsquo;s an extraordinarily moral person.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Russo also recalled Lewis Glucksman, a legendary trader who was later chief executive. Described in the play as a tough guy with a big belly who &ldquo;looks like he wants to kick the world&rsquo;s ass with an ax,&rdquo; Mr. Glucksman was the person who hired Mr. Russo in the early 1990s.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The side that is portrayed was accurate, but it is one side,&rdquo; Mr. Russo said of his former boss, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/08/business/08glucksman.html\">died in 2006</a>. &ldquo;He was also very generous and giving.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After &ldquo;Trilogy&rdquo; ended, Mr. Russo made his way down the audience bleachers. He especially appreciated the play&rsquo;s recounting of the company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/lehman/Exhibition/Introduction\">sweeping legacy</a> and its role in America&rsquo;s transformation into an economic powerhouse.</p>\n<p>Now, what Lehman Brothers is best known for is its collapse.</p>",

                "text": "Michael Noble Jr. for The New York Times\nThomas Russo, the chief legal officer at Lehman Brothers when the Wall Street colossus filed for bankruptcy and threatened to melt down the global financial system, was recalling that frenzied final weekend in September 2008.\n\u201cI remember that Sunday like it was yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the morning we were told we were going to be saved.\u201d They weren\u2019t.\nHe had just come from \u201cThe Lehman Trilogy,\u201d a three-hour-plus theatrical recreation of the real-world drama in which he had taken part. I had invited him to see the performance, and now he was digesting it over a vodka martini.\nWhen a black screen at the Park Avenue Armory rose to reveal a stark glass box, a stripped-down version of Lehman\u2019s emptied offices hours before the bankruptcy filing, Mr. Russo let out a gasp: \u201cOh, my God.\u201d\n\u201cIt was the feeling,\u201d he said later, explaining his visceral reaction to the scene. Mr. Russo said he had ended up quarterbacking that fateful Sunday board meeting at the suggestion of Lehman\u2019s chief executive, Richard S. Fuld Jr., \u201cbecause he, and pretty much everybody in the room, was in total disbelief.\u201d\nAs it turns out, the firm\u2019s actual disbandment occupies just a few minutes of the script. The central story focuses on the original Lehman brothers \u2014 three immigrants from Bavaria who came to this \u201cmagical music box called America\u201d in the mid-19th century \u2014 and their offspring.\nAfter opening a tiny fabric store in Montgomery, Ala., the men turned to brokering cotton between the slave-producing plantations in the South and industrial manufacturers in the North. After the Civil War, they expanded to other commodities before concentrating on financial services and later metamorphosing into the nation\u2019s fourth-largest investment bank. Along the way the firm invested in tobacco and the Panama Canal, Hollywood\u2019s original \u201cKing Kong\u201d and Intel microprocessors.\nThe play follows the ferocious and glittering financial locomotive they rode through American capitalism for more than a century and a half before being roughly dumped off. But that momentous collapse serves as the story\u2019s frame, bracketing its start and its finish.\nEchoes of 1929\nThe play\u2019s narrative arc makes Lehman Brothers\u2019 hubristic fall seem inevitable. Mr. Russo, though, emphasizes that he always thought the investment firm\u2019s bankruptcy was avoidable and that the Federal Reserve erred in not saving the bank.\nSo for him, a goose-bump moment came during a scene depicting a previous crisis, the 1929 crash, which Lehman Brothers managed to survive.\n\u201cThe state will let the first banks fail, won\u2019t lift a finger,\u201d Bobbie, a Lehman grandson, explains in the play, standing in the same glass cube of an office that serves as a stage for the 21st-century action. \u201cThey need to look like they aren\u2019t helping.\u201d\nHe continues: \u201cThat\u2019s why we shouldn\u2019t help the other banks in crisis: If they ask for loans, we should say no. The state will do the same. After that first moment, the state will need strong banks and they\u2019ll help us. If we can survive the first month, they won\u2019t let us fail.\u201d\nAfterward, Mr. Russo talked about that calamitous 2008 weekend. \u201cIt was exactly what happened in the play,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone was more interested in protecting themselves than honoring commitments.\u201d\nWhen Fed officials asked the heads of competing major banks if they could survive a Lehman bankruptcy, they replied yes, Mr. Russo said. \u201cThat probably had a significant impact on the decision to let Lehman go,\u201d he maintained. Soon, those institutions, were receiving the same kind of government assistance denied to Lehman.\nThere were other echoes. Regulation and forced diversification would be the response to Wall Street\u2019s excesses, Bobbie Lehman says. And \u201cthe economy will stop growing, unemployment will rise and the whole system will go into paralysis.\u201d\n\u201cBobbie\u2019s talk was very much 2008 as it was 1929,\u201d Mr. Russo said.\nA Family Pilgrimage\nThe \u201cTrilogy\u201d will head to London\u2019s West End after it finishes its four-week run on Saturday. This production, directed by Sam Mendes, was adapted from the original, which was written in Italian by Stefano Massini and ran five hours.\nPartly reflecting the high-altitude ticket prices ($425 for premium seats), New York audiences have included outsize numbers of financiers, as well as Lehman progeny who went to see the replay of a catastrophic downfall.\nWendy Lehman Lash, great-granddaughter of Mayer Lehman, the youngest of the three brothers, served as a conduit for tickets. \u201cI would say over 100 Lehman offspring have seen it,\u201d she said.\nMs. Lash\u2019s paternal grandfather, Herbert Lehman, spent most of his career in politics, and served as New York\u2019s governor and as a senator. Despite her Lehman roots, \u201cI didn\u2019t know this story, how they reinvented themselves,\u201d Ms. Lash said of the founding patriarchs after seeing the play. \u201cHow Lehman had to go from cotton to banking.\u201d\nJohn L. Loeb Jr., an 88-year-old family scion who researched the family history for a self-published memoir, has seen the show three times. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful theater, but it\u2019s largely the imagination of the author,\u201d Mr. Loeb said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t quite tell the truth.\u201d\nEver since 2008, Mr. Loeb has chafed against the public\u2019s equating the Lehman family itself with the financial crisis. Bobbie Lehman, who died in 1969, was the last family member to lead the firm. And as Mr. Loeb pointed out, American Express bought the company in 1984. A decade later, it spun off Lehman Brothers\u2019 financial service operations through a public stock offering, and Mr. Fuld became chairman and chief executive.\n\u201cI\u2019m affected by the fact that our name is identified with one of the greatest crashes in history, and the Lehmans weren\u2019t really like that,\u201d Mr. Loeb said. \u201cMr. Fuld was a person I don\u2019t think would have ever become a partner of the Lehman Brothers I knew.\u201d\nMr. Fuld started as a summer intern at Lehman in 1966 and was named a partner in 1978.\n\u2018Accurate, but It Is One Side\u2019\nMr. Loeb\u2019s comments reflect the hostile divide depicted in \u201cTrilogy\u2019s\u201d third act between the bone-crunching aggressiveness of the traders who brought in unimagined earnings and the old-style bankers, with their \u201cvelvet and cuff links,\u201d who loved the profits but disdained the ways they were acquired.\nFor Mr. Russo, the third act gave him an opportunity to contrast his own impressions of characters he knew, like Mr. Fuld, with their description onstage.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent more time with Dick probably than anybody else,\u201d said Mr. Russo, who for years had an office next door to Mr. Fuld\u2019s, and recently had lunch with his friend. After the bankruptcy, Mr. Fuld, who presided over Lehman\u2019s demise, was cast as an archvillain. In \u201cTrilogy,\u201d he is referred to by his nickname, the Gorilla, a man who \u201ccarved his way through Wall Street,\u201d but Mr. Russo insisted, \u201cBasically he\u2019s an extraordinarily moral person.\u201d\nMr. Russo also recalled Lewis Glucksman, a legendary trader who was later chief executive. Described in the play as a tough guy with a big belly who \u201clooks like he wants to kick the world\u2019s ass with an ax,\u201d Mr. Glucksman was the person who hired Mr. Russo in the early 1990s.\n\u201cThe side that is portrayed was accurate, but it is one side,\u201d Mr. Russo said of his former boss, who died in 2006. \u201cHe was also very generous and giving.\u201d\nAfter \u201cTrilogy\u201d ended, Mr. Russo made his way down the audience bleachers. He especially appreciated the play\u2019s recounting of the company\u2019s sweeping legacy and its role in America\u2019s transformation into an economic powerhouse.\nNow, what Lehman Brothers is best known for is its collapse.",

Some veterans also say it helps control symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Several million Americans <a href=\"https://ufhealth.org/news/2018/uf-college-pharmacy-receives-35-million-nida-grant-bolster-kratom-research\">are now believed</a> to use kratom.</p>\n<p>One is Andrew Turner, whose PTSD, herniated discs and movement problems affecting his face and neck were so severe after multiple deployments with the Navy that he took as many as 20 prescription medications, including opioids, daily. &ldquo;I was on the path to suicide, and losing hope,&rdquo; Mr. Turner said.</p>\n<p>After he began drinking kratom tea, the pain and dread diminished, he said. &ldquo;It was a night-and-day difference.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But the authorities warn that kratom can be dangerous. Reported <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/kratom\">side effects include</a> seizures, hallucinations and symptoms of psychosis, and there have been calls from inside the Trump administration to curb its use. A new government review links kratom to nearly 100 overdose deaths.</p>\n<p>[<em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/us/doctor-arrested-prescription-drugs.html\">Sixty people across seven states, including 31 doctors, were accused of illegally distributing opioids, sometimes in exchange for sex and money</a></em><em>.</em>]</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is no evidence to indicate that kratom is safe or effective for any medical use,&rdquo; Scott Gottlieb, until recently the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said last year.</p>\n<p>The F.D.A. has warned people to <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/publichealthfocus/ucm584952.htm\">avoid using kratom</a>, saying it &ldquo;appears to have properties that expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse and dependence.&rdquo; It has also raised concerns about false marketing and impurities in the supply.</p>\n<p>Last week, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention weighed in, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6814a2.htm\">reporting</a> that kratom had been found to be a cause of death by medical examiners or coroners in 91 out of 27,000 overdose deaths examined by the agency over an 18-month period ending in December 2017.</p>\n<p>The new report is the highest tally yet of deaths in the United States where kratom is said to have been a factor. But the numbers pale compared to the death toll from opioids: <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates\">almost 48,000 in 2017</a>, according to federal data.</p>\n<p>And like other reports that have linked kratom (pronounced either kray-tum or rhymed with atom) to fatal overdoses, there was a significant caveat in the C.D.C. numbers: the majority of deaths involved additional factors.</p>\n<p>In almost all of the 91 fatalities, toxicology tests determined that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6814a2.htm?s_cid=mm6814a2_x#T1_down\">other drugs were present</a>. Fentanyl, the powerful opioid, was listed as a cause of death in just over half of them. Other prescription opioids, heroin and benzodiazepines like Valium were each listed as a cause of death in about a quarter of those 91 fatalities.</p>\n<p>In seven deaths, kratom was the only substance found, though the C.D.C. said that it could not rule out the presence of other substances in those cases.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Kratom was present primarily in deaths that occurred as a result of overdoses related to substance misuse,&rdquo; the C.D.C. reported. The report does not specify whether the kratom was being used to fight drug dependence or for other reasons.</p>\n<p>The new C.D.C. report is sure to fuel debate inside the government about whether to put kratom on the Drug Enforcement Administration&rsquo;s permanent Schedule I list of controlled substances, which includes heroin and L.S.D.</p>\n<p>Some scientists &mdash; and leading politicians, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-homeland-security.html\">Mick Mulvaney</a>, now President Trump&rsquo;s acting chief of staff &mdash; have also expressed concerns that putting kratom on Schedule I would stymie research into alternatives for opioids and for treating opioid withdrawal.</p>\n<p>Kratom has been widely used in Southeast Asia for years without reported overdose deaths, though there have been reports of users becoming more dependent and tolerant of it with increasing doses, said Oliver Grundmann, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida who has been studying the supplement.</p>\n<p>While Dr. Grundmann said he fully endorsed the F.D.A.&rsquo;s concerns about keeping unsafe products from consumers, he said it is not clear what actually caused many of the deaths attributed to kratom.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If somebody had a pre-existing condition or had been taking prescription drugs or illicit drugs, it is exponentially difficult to pull apart all of the substances and compounds they had been exposed to and determine what is actually responsible for that person&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Dr. Grundmann was one of a dozen researchers who in November warned the Department of Health and Human Services and the D.E.A. that putting kratom out of the reach of consumers could cause bigger problems, leading them to seek it on the black market or relapse to using opioids, posing what their letter said was &ldquo;a serious risk of death.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Advocates of kratom blame some deaths on adulterated products that contained other drugs or dangerous substances. (Last year, the F.D.A. also <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/kratom-02-18/index.html\">found salmonella</a> in kratom shipments. Fifty hospitalizations were reported, but no deaths.) The advocates have been pushing for tighter manufacturing and labeling requirements.</p>\n<p>Critics who warn of kratom&rsquo;s hazards point to examples like Caleb Sturgis, 25, <a href=\"https://www.philly.com/health/kratom-deaths-mitragynine-overdose-opioids-herbal-tea-20190307.html\">whose family sued a kratom distributor</a> after Mr. Sturgis died last summer when his car hit a curb and flipped over.</p>\n<p>The coroner determined that the cause of death was &ldquo;acute mitragynine intoxication,&rdquo; a reference to the principal psychoactive element of kratom. Outside of high levels of mitragynine, the only other substance noted in the lab report was caffeine.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The only thing they found in his system was a high level of kratom, and caffeine consistent with a cup of coffee,&rdquo; said Robert Mongeluzzi, a lawyer for the family. &ldquo;It simply isn&rsquo;t safe.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Kratom has <a href=\"http://speciosa.org/home/kratom-legality-map/\">been banned</a> in a half-dozen states and in a handful of local jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>The prospect of a federal ban produced a furious backlash in 2016, when the D.E.A. <a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2016/08/30/dea-announces-intent-schedule-kratom\">announced plans</a> to temporarily place kratom on the Schedule I list, citing a &ldquo;high potential for abuse&rdquo; and no accepted medical use.</p>\n<p>Users flooded the D.E.A. with letters denouncing the proposal. Mr. Mulvaney, then a Republican congressman from South Carolina, and 50 other House members sent a letter to the agency urging a delay.</p>\n<p>The D.E.A.&rsquo;s move would &ldquo;put a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictions &mdash; a significant public health threat,&rdquo; they wrote.</p>\n<p>Nine senators, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, also pressed the D.E.A. not to restrict the supplement without going through its normal deliberative process, citing &ldquo;the long reported history of kratom use, coupled with the public&rsquo;s sentiment that it is a safe alternative to prescription opioids.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Under pressure, the D.E.A. walked back its plans. But inside the administration, officials have continued to push to curb kratom&rsquo;s availability. In November, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/09/hhs-recommended-dea-ban-kratom-documents-show/\">STAT News disclosed</a> a memo in which the Department of Health and Human Services and the F.D.A. recommended that the active alkaloids in kratom be put on the permanent Schedule I list.</p>\n<p>The department now says that the memo was &ldquo;pre-decisional.&rdquo; But an H.H.S. spokesman, Bill Hall, said the department &ldquo;remains concerned about the use of kratom, as there is no reliable scientific evidence to support the use of kratom for any therapeutic effects, and significant safety issues exist. Fraudulent health claims can pose serious health risks.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The recommendation won&rsquo;t be the only factor in the ultimate decision, which a spokeswoman for the D.E.A. said could take months or years. The D.E.A. will also rely on medical examiners&rsquo; reports, overdose statistics, and public comments, among other things, said the spokeswoman, Katherine Pfaff.</p>",

                "text": "Joe Raedle/Getty Images\nThe steep rise in the number of people suffering opioid addiction has helped spawn the widespread use of another substance: kratom, a green powdered herbal supplement that is widely available and virtually unregulated.\nDerived from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia and sold in the United States online and in bodegas and head shops, kratom has long been used as a mood booster, energy supplement and pain reliever.\nIt is also increasingly being used by those who swear by it as a curb for opioid addiction. Some veterans also say it helps control symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Several million Americans are now believed to use kratom.\nOne is Andrew Turner, whose PTSD, herniated discs and movement problems affecting his face and neck were so severe after multiple deployments with the Navy that he took as many as 20 prescription medications, including opioids, daily. \u201cI was on the path to suicide, and losing hope,\u201d Mr. Turner said.\nAfter he began drinking kratom tea, the pain and dread diminished, he said. \u201cIt was a night-and-day difference.\u201d\nBut the authorities warn that kratom can be dangerous. Reported side effects include seizures, hallucinations and symptoms of psychosis, and there have been calls from inside the Trump administration to curb its use. A new government review links kratom to nearly 100 overdose deaths.\n[Sixty people across seven states, including 31 doctors, were accused of illegally distributing opioids, sometimes in exchange for sex and money.]\n\u201cThere is no evidence to indicate that kratom is safe or effective for any medical use,\u201d Scott Gottlieb, until recently the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said last year.\nThe F.D.A. has warned people to avoid using kratom, saying it \u201cappears to have properties that expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse and dependence.\u201d It has also raised concerns about false marketing and impurities in the supply.\nLast week, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention weighed in, reporting that kratom had been found to be a cause of death by medical examiners or coroners in 91 out of 27,000 overdose deaths examined by the agency over an 18-month period ending in December 2017.\nThe new report is the highest tally yet of deaths in the United States where kratom is said to have been a factor. But the numbers pale compared to the death toll from opioids: almost 48,000 in 2017, according to federal data.\nAnd like other reports that have linked kratom (pronounced either kray-tum or rhymed with atom) to fatal overdoses, there was a significant caveat in the C.D.C. numbers: the majority of deaths involved additional factors.\nIn almost all of the 91 fatalities, toxicology tests determined that other drugs were present. Fentanyl, the powerful opioid, was listed as a cause of death in just over half of them. Other prescription opioids, heroin and benzodiazepines like Valium were each listed as a cause of death in about a quarter of those 91 fatalities.\nIn seven deaths, kratom was the only substance found, though the C.D.C. said that it could not rule out the presence of other substances in those cases.\n\u201cKratom was present primarily in deaths that occurred as a result of overdoses related to substance misuse,\u201d the C.D.C. reported. The report does not specify whether the kratom was being used to fight drug dependence or for other reasons.\nThe new C.D.C. report is sure to fuel debate inside the government about whether to put kratom on the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s permanent Schedule I list of controlled substances, which includes heroin and L.S.D.\nSome scientists \u2014 and leading politicians, including Mick Mulvaney, now President Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff \u2014 have also expressed concerns that putting kratom on Schedule I would stymie research into alternatives for opioids and for treating opioid withdrawal.\nKratom has been widely used in Southeast Asia for years without reported overdose deaths, though there have been reports of users becoming more dependent and tolerant of it with increasing doses, said Oliver Grundmann, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida who has been studying the supplement.\nWhile Dr. Grundmann said he fully endorsed the F.D.A.\u2019s concerns about keeping unsafe products from consumers, he said it is not clear what actually caused many of the deaths attributed to kratom.\n\u201cIf somebody had a pre-existing condition or had been taking prescription drugs or illicit drugs, it is exponentially difficult to pull apart all of the substances and compounds they had been exposed to and determine what is actually responsible for that person\u2019s death,\u201d he said.\nDr. Grundmann was one of a dozen researchers who in November warned the Department of Health and Human Services and the D.E.A. that putting kratom out of the reach of consumers could cause bigger problems, leading them to seek it on the black market or relapse to using opioids, posing what their letter said was \u201ca serious risk of death.\u201d\nAdvocates of kratom blame some deaths on adulterated products that contained other drugs or dangerous substances. (Last year, the F.D.A. also found salmonella in kratom shipments. Fifty hospitalizations were reported, but no deaths.) The advocates have been pushing for tighter manufacturing and labeling requirements.\nCritics who warn of kratom\u2019s hazards point to examples like Caleb Sturgis, 25, whose family sued a kratom distributor after Mr. Sturgis died last summer when his car hit a curb and flipped over.\nThe coroner determined that the cause of death was \u201cacute mitragynine intoxication,\u201d a reference to the principal psychoactive element of kratom. Outside of high levels of mitragynine, the only other substance noted in the lab report was caffeine.\n\u201cThe only thing they found in his system was a high level of kratom, and caffeine consistent with a cup of coffee,\u201d said Robert Mongeluzzi, a lawyer for the family. \u201cIt simply isn\u2019t safe.\u201d\nKratom has been banned in a half-dozen states and in a handful of local jurisdictions.\nThe prospect of a federal ban produced a furious backlash in 2016, when the D.E.A. announced plans to temporarily place kratom on the Schedule I list, citing a \u201chigh potential for abuse\u201d and no accepted medical use.\nUsers flooded the D.E.A. with letters denouncing the proposal. Mr. Mulvaney, then a Republican congressman from South Carolina, and 50 other House members sent a letter to the agency urging a delay.\nThe D.E.A.\u2019s move would \u201cput a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictions \u2014 a significant public health threat,\u201d they wrote.\nNine senators, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, also pressed the D.E.A. not to restrict the supplement without going through its normal deliberative process, citing \u201cthe long reported history of kratom use, coupled with the public\u2019s sentiment that it is a safe alternative to prescription opioids.\u201d\nUnder pressure, the D.E.A. walked back its plans. But inside the administration, officials have continued to push to curb kratom\u2019s availability. In November, STAT News disclosed a memo in which the Department of Health and Human Services and the F.D.A. recommended that the active alkaloids in kratom be put on the permanent Schedule I list.\nThe department now says that the memo was \u201cpre-decisional.\u201d But an H.H.S. spokesman, Bill Hall, said the department \u201cremains concerned about the use of kratom, as there is no reliable scientific evidence to support the use of kratom for any therapeutic effects, and significant safety issues exist. Fraudulent health claims can pose serious health risks.\u201d\nThe recommendation won\u2019t be the only factor in the ultimate decision, which a spokeswoman for the D.E.A. said could take months or years. The D.E.A. will also rely on medical examiners\u2019 reports, overdose statistics, and public comments, among other things, said the spokeswoman, Katherine Pfaff.",

                "html": "<p><strong>My first, charmed</strong> week as a student at Harvard Business School, late in the summer of 2001, felt like a halcyon time for capitalism. AOL Time Warner, Yahoo and Napster were benevolently connecting the world. Enron and WorldCom were bringing innovation to hidebound industries. President George W. Bush &mdash; an H.B.S. graduate himself &mdash; had promised to deliver progress and prosperity with businesslike efficiency.</p>\n<p>The next few years would prove how little we (and Washington and much of corporate America) really understood about the economy and the world. But at the time, for the 895 first-years preparing ourselves for business moguldom, what really excited us was our good luck. A Harvard M.B.A. seemed like a winning lottery ticket, a gilded highway to world-changing influence, fantastic wealth and &mdash; if those self-satisfied portraits that lined the hallways were any indication &mdash; a lifetime of deeply meaningful work.</p>\n<p>So it came as a bit of a shock, when I attended my 15th reunion last summer, to learn how many of my former classmates weren&rsquo;t overjoyed by their professional lives &mdash; in fact, they were miserable. I heard about one fellow alum who had run a large hedge fund until being sued by investors (who also happened to be the fund manager&rsquo;s relatives). Another person had risen to a senior role inside one of the nation&rsquo;s most prestigious companies before being savagely pushed out by corporate politics. Another had learned in the maternity ward that her firm was being stolen by a conniving partner.</p>\n<p><em>[Housecleaners, nannies, health aides and domestic workers are organizing to secure job security. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/national-domestic-workers-alliance.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article\">Read about the new labor movement in our Future of Work issue</a>.] </em></p>\n<p>Those were extreme examples, of course. Most of us were living relatively normal, basically content lives. But even among my more sanguine classmates, there was a lingering sense of professional disappointment. They talked about missed promotions, disaffected children and billable hours in divorce court. They complained about jobs that were unfulfilling, tedious or just plain bad. One classmate described having to invest $5 million a day &mdash; which didn&rsquo;t sound terrible, until he explained that if he put only $4 million to work on Monday, he had to scramble to place $6 million on Tuesday, and his co-workers were constantly undermining one another in search of the next promotion. It was insanely stressful work, done among people he didn&rsquo;t particularly like. He earned about $1.2 million a year and hated going to the office.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m wasting my life,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;When I die, is anyone going to care that I earned an extra percentage point of return? My work feels totally meaningless.&rdquo; He recognized the incredible privilege of his pay and status, but his anguish seemed genuine. &ldquo;If you spend 12 hours a day doing work you hate, at some point it doesn&rsquo;t matter what your paycheck says,&rdquo; he told me. There&rsquo;s no magic salary at which a bad job becomes good. He had received an offer at a start-up, and he would have loved to take it, but it paid half as much, and he felt locked into a lifestyle that made this pay cut impossible. &ldquo;My wife laughed when I told her about it,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;When I die, is anyone going to care that I earned an extra percentage point of return? My work feels totally meaningless.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>After our reunion, I wondered if my Harvard class &mdash; or even just my own friends there &mdash; were an anomaly. So I began looking for data about the nation&rsquo;s professional psyche. What I found was that my classmates were hardly unique in their dissatisfaction; even in a boom economy, a surprising portion of Americans are professionally miserable right now. In the mid-1980s, roughly 61 percent of workers told pollsters they were satisfied with their jobs. Since then, that number has declined substantially, hovering around half; the low point was in 2010, when only 43 percent of workers were satisfied, <a href=\"https://www.conference-board.org/blog/postdetail.cfm?post=6391\">according to data collected by the Conference Board</a>, a nonprofit research organization. The rest said they were unhappy, or at best neutral, about how they spent the bulk of their days. Even among professionals given to lofty self-images, like those in medicine and law, other studies have noted a rise in discontent. Why? Based on my own conversations with classmates and the research I began reviewing, the answer comes down to oppressive hours, political infighting, increased competition sparked by globalization, an &ldquo;always-on culture&rdquo; bred by the internet &mdash; but also something that&rsquo;s hard for these professionals to put their finger on, an underlying sense that their work isn&rsquo;t worth the grueling effort they&rsquo;re putting into it.</p>\n<p>This wave of dissatisfaction is especially perverse because corporations now have access to decades of scientific research about how to make jobs better. &ldquo;We have so much evidence about what people need,&rdquo; says Adam Grant, a professor of management and psychology at the University of Pennsylvania (and a contributing opinion writer at The Times). Basic financial security, of course, is critical &mdash; as is a sense that your job won&rsquo;t disappear unexpectedly. What&rsquo;s interesting, however, is that once you can provide financially for yourself and your family, according to studies, additional salary and benefits don&rsquo;t reliably contribute to worker satisfaction. Much more important are things like whether a job provides a sense of autonomy &mdash; the ability to control your time and the authority to act on your unique expertise. People want to work alongside others whom they respect (and, optimally, enjoy spending time with) and who seem to respect them in return.</p>\n<p>And finally, workers want to feel that their labors are meaningful. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be curing cancer,&rdquo; says Barry Schwartz, a visiting professor of management at the University of California, Berkeley. We want to feel that we&rsquo;re making the world better, even if it&rsquo;s as small a matter as helping a shopper find the right product at the grocery store. &ldquo;You can be a salesperson, or a toll collector, but if you see your goal as solving people&rsquo;s problems, then each day presents 100 opportunities to improve someone&rsquo;s life, and your satisfaction increases dramatically,&rdquo; Schwartz says.</p>\n<p>One of the more significant examples of how meaningfulness influences job satisfaction comes from <a href=\"http://faculty.som.yale.edu/amywrzesniewski/documents/Craftingajob_Revisioningemployees_000.pdf\">a study published in 2001.</a> Two researchers &mdash; Amy Wrzesniewski of Yale and Jane Dutton, now a distinguished emeritus professor at the University of Michigan &mdash; wanted to figure out why particular janitors at a large hospital were so much more enthusiastic than others. So they began conducting interviews and found that, by design and habit, some members of the janitorial staff saw their jobs not as just tidying up but as a form of healing. One woman, for instance, mopped rooms inside a brain-injury unit where many residents were comatose. The woman&rsquo;s duties were basic: change bedpans, pick up trash. But she also sometimes took the initiative to swap around the pictures on the walls, because she believed a subtle stimulation change in the unconscious patients&rsquo; environment might speed their recovery. She talked to other convalescents about their lives. &ldquo;I enjoy entertaining the patients,&rdquo; she told the researchers. &ldquo;That is not really part of my job description, but I like putting on a show for them.&rdquo; She would dance around, tell jokes to families sitting vigil at bedsides, try to cheer up or distract everyone from the pain and uncertainty that otherwise surrounded them. <a href=\"http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/janedut/High%20Quality%20Connections/Interpersonal%20Sensemaking.pdf\">In a 2003 study</a> led by the researchers, another custodian described cleaning the same room two times in order to ease the mind of a stressed-out father.</p>\n<p>To some, the moral might seem obvious: If you see your job as healing the sick, rather than just swabbing up messes, you&rsquo;re likely to have a deeper sense of purpose whenever you grab the mop. But what&rsquo;s remarkable is how few workplaces seem to have internalized this simple lesson. &ldquo;There are so many jobs where people feel like what they do is relatively meaningless,&rdquo; Wrzesniewski says. &ldquo;Even for well-paid positions, or jobs where you assume workers feel a sense of meaning, people feel like what they&rsquo;re doing doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s certainly true for my miserable classmate earning $1.2 million a year. Even though, in theory, the investments he makes each day help fund pensions &mdash; and thus the lives of retirees &mdash; it&rsquo;s pretty hard to see that altruism from his window office in a Manhattan skyscraper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just numbers on a screen to me,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never met a retiree who enjoyed a vacation because of what I do. It&rsquo;s so theoretical it hardly seems real.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>There is a</strong> raging debate &mdash; on newspaper pages, inside Silicon Valley, among presidential hopefuls &mdash; as to what constitutes a &ldquo;good job.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m an investigative business reporter, and so I have a strange perspective on this question. When I speak to employees at a company, it&rsquo;s usually because something has gone wrong. My stock-in-trade are sources who feel their employers are acting unethically or ignoring sound advice. The workers who speak to me are willing to describe both the good and the bad in the places where they work, in the hope that we will all benefit from their insights.</p>\n<p>The smoothest life paths sometimes fail to teach us about what really brings us satisfaction day to day.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s interesting to me, though, is that these workers usually don&rsquo;t come across as unhappy. When they agree to talk to a journalist &mdash; to share confidential documents or help readers understand how things went awry &mdash; it&rsquo;s not because they hate their employers or are overwhelmingly disgruntled. They often seem to love their jobs and admire the companies they work for. They admire them enough, in fact, to want to help them improve. They are engaged and content. They believe what they are doing matters &mdash; both in coming to work every day and in blowing the whistle on problems they see.</p>\n<p>Do these people have &ldquo;good jobs&rdquo;? Are they luckier or less fortunate than my $1.2 million friend, who couldn&rsquo;t care less about his firm? Are Google employees who work 60 hours a week but who can eat many of their meals (or freeze their eggs) on the company&rsquo;s dime more satisfied than a start-up founder in Des Moines who cleans the office herself but sees her dream become reality?</p>\n<p>As the airwaves heat up in anticipation of the 2020 election, Americans are likely to hear a lot of competing views about what a &ldquo;good job&rdquo; entails. Some will celebrate billionaires as examples of this nation&rsquo;s greatness, while others will pillory them as evidence of an economy gone astray. Through all of that, it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind that the concept of a &ldquo;good job&rdquo; is inherently complicated, because ultimately it&rsquo;s a conversation about what we value, whether individually or collectively. Even for Americans who live frighteningly close to the bone, like the janitors studied by Wrzesniewski and Dutton, a job is usually more than just a means to a paycheck. It&rsquo;s a source of purpose and meaning, a place in the world.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a possibility, when it comes to understanding good jobs, that we have it all wrong. When I was speaking to my H.B.S. classmates, one of them reminded me about some people at our reunion who seemed wholly unmiserable &mdash; who seemed, somewhat to their own surprise, to have wound up with jobs that were both financially and emotionally rewarding. I knew of one person who had become a prominent venture capitalist; another friend had started a retail empire that expanded to five states; yet another was selling goods all over the world. There were some who had become investors running their own funds.</p>\n<p>And many of them had something in common: They tended to be the also-rans of the class, the ones who failed to get the jobs they wanted when they graduated. They had been passed over by McKinsey &amp; Company and Google, Goldman Sachs and Apple, the big venture-capital firms and prestigious investment houses. Instead, they were forced to scramble for work &mdash; and thus to grapple, earlier in their careers, with the trade-offs that life inevitably demands. These late bloomers seemed to have learned the lessons about workplace meaning preached by people like Barry Schwartz. It wasn&rsquo;t that their workplaces were enlightened or (as far as I could tell) that H.B.S. had taught them anything special. Rather, they had learned from their own setbacks. And often they wound up richer, more powerful and more content than everyone else.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s not to wish genuine hardship on any American worker, given that a setback for a poor or working-class person can lead to bankruptcy, hunger or worse. But for those who do find themselves miserable at work, it&rsquo;s an important reminder that the smoothest life paths sometimes fail to teach us about what really brings us satisfaction day to day. A core goal of capitalism is evaluating and putting a price on risk. In our professional lives, we hedge against misfortune by taking out insurance policies in the form of fancy degrees, saving against rainy days by pursuing careers that promise stability. Nowadays, however, stability is increasingly scarce, and risk is harder to measure. Many of our insurance policies have turned out to be worth as much as Enron.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m jealous of everyone who had the balls to do something that made them happy,&rdquo; my $1.2 million friend told me. &ldquo;It seemed like too big a risk for me to take when we were at school.&rdquo; But as one of the also-rans myself &mdash; I applied to McKinsey, to private-equity firms and to a real estate conglomerate and was rejected by them all &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t need any courage in making the decision to go into the modest-paying (by H.B.S. standards) field of journalism. Some of my classmates thought I was making a huge mistake by ignoring all the doors H.B.S. had opened for me in high finance and Silicon Valley. What they didn&rsquo;t know was that those doors, in fact, had stayed shut &mdash; and that as a result, I was saved from the temptation of easy riches. I&rsquo;ve been thankful ever since, grateful that my bad luck made it easier to choose a profession that I&rsquo;ve loved. Finding meaning, whether as a banker or a janitor, is difficult work. Usually life, rather than a business-school classroom, is the place to learn how to do it.</p>",

                "text": "My first, charmed week as a student at Harvard Business School, late in the summer of 2001, felt like a halcyon time for capitalism. AOL Time Warner, Yahoo and Napster were benevolently connecting the world. Enron and WorldCom were bringing innovation to hidebound industries. President George W. Bush \u2014 an H.B.S. graduate himself \u2014 had promised to deliver progress and prosperity with businesslike efficiency.\nThe next few years would prove how little we (and Washington and much of corporate America) really understood about the economy and the world. But at the time, for the 895 first-years preparing ourselves for business moguldom, what really excited us was our good luck. A Harvard M.B.A. seemed like a winning lottery ticket, a gilded highway to world-changing influence, fantastic wealth and \u2014 if those self-satisfied portraits that lined the hallways were any indication \u2014 a lifetime of deeply meaningful work.\nSo it came as a bit of a shock, when I attended my 15th reunion last summer, to learn how many of my former classmates weren\u2019t overjoyed by their professional lives \u2014 in fact, they were miserable. I heard about one fellow alum who had run a large hedge fund until being sued by investors (who also happened to be the fund manager\u2019s relatives). Another person had risen to a senior role inside one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious companies before being savagely pushed out by corporate politics. Another had learned in the maternity ward that her firm was being stolen by a conniving partner.\n[Housecleaners, nannies, health aides and domestic workers are organizing to secure job security. Read about the new labor movement in our Future of Work issue.]\nThose were extreme examples, of course. Most of us were living relatively normal, basically content lives. But even among my more sanguine classmates, there was a lingering sense of professional disappointment. They talked about missed promotions, disaffected children and billable hours in divorce court. They complained about jobs that were unfulfilling, tedious or just plain bad. One classmate described having to invest $5 million a day \u2014 which didn\u2019t sound terrible, until he explained that if he put only $4 million to work on Monday, he had to scramble to place $6 million on Tuesday, and his co-workers were constantly undermining one another in search of the next promotion. It was insanely stressful work, done among people he didn\u2019t particularly like. He earned about $1.2 million a year and hated going to the office.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m wasting my life,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhen I die, is anyone going to care that I earned an extra percentage point of return? My work feels totally meaningless.\u201d He recognized the incredible privilege of his pay and status, but his anguish seemed genuine. \u201cIf you spend 12 hours a day doing work you hate, at some point it doesn\u2019t matter what your paycheck says,\u201d he told me. There\u2019s no magic salary at which a bad job becomes good. He had received an offer at a start-up, and he would have loved to take it, but it paid half as much, and he felt locked into a lifestyle that made this pay cut impossible. \u201cMy wife laughed when I told her about it,\u201d he said.\n\u2018When I die, is anyone going to care that I earned an extra percentage point of return? My work feels totally meaningless.\u2019\nAfter our reunion, I wondered if my Harvard class \u2014 or even just my own friends there \u2014 were an anomaly. So I began looking for data about the nation\u2019s professional psyche. What I found was that my classmates were hardly unique in their dissatisfaction; even in a boom economy, a surprising portion of Americans are professionally miserable right now. In the mid-1980s, roughly 61 percent of workers told pollsters they were satisfied with their jobs. Since then, that number has declined substantially, hovering around half; the low point was in 2010, when only 43 percent of workers were satisfied, according to data collected by the Conference Board, a nonprofit research organization. The rest said they were unhappy, or at best neutral, about how they spent the bulk of their days. Even among professionals given to lofty self-images, like those in medicine and law, other studies have noted a rise in discontent. Why? Based on my own conversations with classmates and the research I began reviewing, the answer comes down to oppressive hours, political infighting, increased competition sparked by globalization, an \u201calways-on culture\u201d bred by the internet \u2014 but also something that\u2019s hard for these professionals to put their finger on, an underlying sense that their work isn\u2019t worth the grueling effort they\u2019re putting into it.\nThis wave of dissatisfaction is especially perverse because corporations now have access to decades of scientific research about how to make jobs better. \u201cWe have so much evidence about what people need,\u201d says Adam Grant, a professor of management and psychology at the University of Pennsylvania (and a contributing opinion writer at The Times). Basic financial security, of course, is critical \u2014 as is a sense that your job won\u2019t disappear unexpectedly. What\u2019s interesting, however, is that once you can provide financially for yourself and your family, according to studies, additional salary and benefits don\u2019t reliably contribute to worker satisfaction. Much more important are things like whether a job provides a sense of autonomy \u2014 the ability to control your time and the authority to act on your unique expertise. People want to work alongside others whom they respect (and, optimally, enjoy spending time with) and who seem to respect them in return.\nAnd finally, workers want to feel that their labors are meaningful. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be curing cancer,\u201d says Barry Schwartz, a visiting professor of management at the University of California, Berkeley. We want to feel that we\u2019re making the world better, even if it\u2019s as small a matter as helping a shopper find the right product at the grocery store. \u201cYou can be a salesperson, or a toll collector, but if you see your goal as solving people\u2019s problems, then each day presents 100 opportunities to improve someone\u2019s life, and your satisfaction increases dramatically,\u201d Schwartz says.\nOne of the more significant examples of how meaningfulness influences job satisfaction comes from a study published in 2001. Two researchers \u2014 Amy Wrzesniewski of Yale and Jane Dutton, now a distinguished emeritus professor at the University of Michigan \u2014 wanted to figure out why particular janitors at a large hospital were so much more enthusiastic than others. So they began conducting interviews and found that, by design and habit, some members of the janitorial staff saw their jobs not as just tidying up but as a form of healing. One woman, for instance, mopped rooms inside a brain-injury unit where many residents were comatose. The woman\u2019s duties were basic: change bedpans, pick up trash. But she also sometimes took the initiative to swap around the pictures on the walls, because she believed a subtle stimulation change in the unconscious patients\u2019 environment might speed their recovery. She talked to other convalescents about their lives. \u201cI enjoy entertaining the patients,\u201d she told the researchers. \u201cThat is not really part of my job description, but I like putting on a show for them.\u201d She would dance around, tell jokes to families sitting vigil at bedsides, try to cheer up or distract everyone from the pain and uncertainty that otherwise surrounded them. In a 2003 study led by the researchers, another custodian described cleaning the same room two times in order to ease the mind of a stressed-out father.\nTo some, the moral might seem obvious: If you see your job as healing the sick, rather than just swabbing up messes, you\u2019re likely to have a deeper sense of purpose whenever you grab the mop. But what\u2019s remarkable is how few workplaces seem to have internalized this simple lesson. \u201cThere are so many jobs where people feel like what they do is relatively meaningless,\u201d Wrzesniewski says. \u201cEven for well-paid positions, or jobs where you assume workers feel a sense of meaning, people feel like what they\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d That\u2019s certainly true for my miserable classmate earning $1.2 million a year. Even though, in theory, the investments he makes each day help fund pensions \u2014 and thus the lives of retirees \u2014 it\u2019s pretty hard to see that altruism from his window office in a Manhattan skyscraper. \u201cIt\u2019s just numbers on a screen to me,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a retiree who enjoyed a vacation because of what I do. It\u2019s so theoretical it hardly seems real.\u201d\nThere is a raging debate \u2014 on newspaper pages, inside Silicon Valley, among presidential hopefuls \u2014 as to what constitutes a \u201cgood job.\u201d I\u2019m an investigative business reporter, and so I have a strange perspective on this question. When I speak to employees at a company, it\u2019s usually because something has gone wrong. My stock-in-trade are sources who feel their employers are acting unethically or ignoring sound advice. The workers who speak to me are willing to describe both the good and the bad in the places where they work, in the hope that we will all benefit from their insights.\nThe smoothest life paths sometimes fail to teach us about what really brings us satisfaction day to day.\nWhat\u2019s interesting to me, though, is that these workers usually don\u2019t come across as unhappy. When they agree to talk to a journalist \u2014 to share confidential documents or help readers understand how things went awry \u2014 it\u2019s not because they hate their employers or are overwhelmingly disgruntled. They often seem to love their jobs and admire the companies they work for. They admire them enough, in fact, to want to help them improve. They are engaged and content. They believe what they are doing matters \u2014 both in coming to work every day and in blowing the whistle on problems they see.\nDo these people have \u201cgood jobs\u201d? Are they luckier or less fortunate than my $1.2 million friend, who couldn\u2019t care less about his firm? Are Google employees who work 60 hours a week but who can eat many of their meals (or freeze their eggs) on the company\u2019s dime more satisfied than a start-up founder in Des Moines who cleans the office herself but sees her dream become reality?\nAs the airwaves heat up in anticipation of the 2020 election, Americans are likely to hear a lot of competing views about what a \u201cgood job\u201d entails. Some will celebrate billionaires as examples of this nation\u2019s greatness, while others will pillory them as evidence of an economy gone astray. Through all of that, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that the concept of a \u201cgood job\u201d is inherently complicated, because ultimately it\u2019s a conversation about what we value, whether individually or collectively. Even for Americans who live frighteningly close to the bone, like the janitors studied by Wrzesniewski and Dutton, a job is usually more than just a means to a paycheck. It\u2019s a source of purpose and meaning, a place in the world.\nThere\u2019s a possibility, when it comes to understanding good jobs, that we have it all wrong. When I was speaking to my H.B.S. classmates, one of them reminded me about some people at our reunion who seemed wholly unmiserable \u2014 who seemed, somewhat to their own surprise, to have wound up with jobs that were both financially and emotionally rewarding. I knew of one person who had become a prominent venture capitalist; another friend had started a retail empire that expanded to five states; yet another was selling goods all over the world. There were some who had become investors running their own funds.\nAnd many of them had something in common: They tended to be the also-rans of the class, the ones who failed to get the jobs they wanted when they graduated. They had been passed over by McKinsey & Company and Google, Goldman Sachs and Apple, the big venture-capital firms and prestigious investment houses. Instead, they were forced to scramble for work \u2014 and thus to grapple, earlier in their careers, with the trade-offs that life inevitably demands. These late bloomers seemed to have learned the lessons about workplace meaning preached by people like Barry Schwartz. It wasn\u2019t that their workplaces were enlightened or (as far as I could tell) that H.B.S. had taught them anything special. Rather, they had learned from their own setbacks. And often they wound up richer, more powerful and more content than everyone else.\nThat\u2019s not to wish genuine hardship on any American worker, given that a setback for a poor or working-class person can lead to bankruptcy, hunger or worse. But for those who do find themselves miserable at work, it\u2019s an important reminder that the smoothest life paths sometimes fail to teach us about what really brings us satisfaction day to day. A core goal of capitalism is evaluating and putting a price on risk. In our professional lives, we hedge against misfortune by taking out insurance policies in the form of fancy degrees, saving against rainy days by pursuing careers that promise stability. Nowadays, however, stability is increasingly scarce, and risk is harder to measure. Many of our insurance policies have turned out to be worth as much as Enron.\n\u201cI\u2019m jealous of everyone who had the balls to do something that made them happy,\u201d my $1.2 million friend told me. \u201cIt seemed like too big a risk for me to take when we were at school.\u201d But as one of the also-rans myself \u2014 I applied to McKinsey, to private-equity firms and to a real estate conglomerate and was rejected by them all \u2014 I didn\u2019t need any courage in making the decision to go into the modest-paying (by H.B.S. standards) field of journalism. Some of my classmates thought I was making a huge mistake by ignoring all the doors H.B.S. had opened for me in high finance and Silicon Valley. What they didn\u2019t know was that those doors, in fact, had stayed shut \u2014 and that as a result, I was saved from the temptation of easy riches. I\u2019ve been thankful ever since, grateful that my bad luck made it easier to choose a profession that I\u2019ve loved. Finding meaning, whether as a banker or a janitor, is difficult work. Usually life, rather than a business-school classroom, is the place to learn how to do it.",
